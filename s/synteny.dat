25|$|The entire genomes of the centric diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana (32.4 Mb), and the pennate diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum (27.4 Mb), {{have been}} sequenced. Comparisons {{of the two}} fully sequenced diatom genomes finds that the P. tricornutum genome {{includes}} fewer genes (10,402 opposed to 11,776) than T. pseudonana and no major <b>synteny</b> (gene order) could be detected between the two genomes. T. pseudonana genes show an average of ~1.52 introns per gene as opposed to 0.79 in P. tricornutum, suggesting recent widespread intron gain in the centric diatom. Despite relatively recent evolutionary divergence (90 million years), the extent of molecular divergence between centrics and pennates indicates rapid evolutionary rates within the Bacillariophyceae compared to other eukaryotic groups. Comparative genomics also established that a specific class of transposable elements, the Diatom Copia-like retrotransposons (or CoDis), has been significantly amplified in the P. tricornutum genome with respect to T. pseudonana, constituting 5.8 and 1% of the respective genomes.|$|E

40|$|We tested {{hypotheses}} {{concerning the}} origin of bird and mammal sex chromosomes by mapping the location of amniote sex-chromosome loci in a salamander amphibian (Ambystoma). We found that ambystomatid orthologs of human X and chicken Z sex chromosomes map to neighboring regions of a common Ambystoma linkage group 2 (ALG 2). We show statistically {{that the proportion of}} human X and chicken Z orthologs observed on ALG 2 is significantly different from the proportion that would be expected by chance. We further show that conserved <b>syntenies</b> between ALG 2 and amniote chromosomes are identified as overlapping conserved <b>syntenies</b> when all available chicken (N = 3120) and human (N = 14, 922) RefSeq orthologs are reciprocally compared. In particular, the data suggest that chromosomal regions from chicken chromosomes (GGA) Z and 4 and from human chromosomes (HSA) 9, 4, X, 5, and 8 were linked ancestrally. A more distant outgroup comparison with the pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis reveals ALG 2 /GGAZ/HSAX <b>syntenies</b> among three pairs of ancestral chromosome duplicates. Overall, our results suggest that sex chromosomal regions of birds and mammals were recruited from a common ancestral chromosome, and thus our findings conflict with the currently accepted hypothesis of separate autosomal origins. We note that our results were obtained using the most immediate outgroup to the amniote clade (mammals, birds, and other reptiles) while the currently accepted hypothesis is primarily based upon conserved <b>syntenies</b> between in-group taxa (birds and mammals). Our study illustrates the importance of an amphibian outgroup perspective in identifying ancestral amniote gene orders and in reconstructing patterns of vertebrate sex-chromosome evolution...|$|R

Together with the species reported here there are now six species of rodents mapped with Mus musculus painting probes. A parsimony analysis indicated that the <b>syntenies</b> of nine M. musculus chromosomes were most likely already formed in the muroid ancestor: 3, 4, 7, 9, 14, 18, 19, X and Y. The widespread occurrence of syntenic segment associations of mouse chromosomes 1 / 17, 2 / 13, 7 / 19, 10 / 17, 11 / 16, 12 / 17 and 13 / 15 suggests that these associations were ancestral <b>syntenies</b> for muroid rodents.

40|$|Abstract Background Rainbow trout is an {{economically}} important fish and a suitable experimental organism in many fields of biology including genome evolution, {{owing to the}} occurrence of a salmonid specific whole-genome duplication (4 th WGD). Rainbow trout is {{among some of the}} most studied teleosts and has benefited from substantial efforts to develop genomic resources (e. g., linkage maps. Here, we first generated a synthetic map by merging segregation data files derived from three independent linkage maps. Then, we used it to evaluate genome conservation between rainbow trout and three teleost models, medaka, stickleback and zebrafish and to further investigate the extent of the 4 th WGD in trout genome. Results The INRA linkage map was updated by adding 211 new markers. After standardization of marker names, consistency of marker assignment to linkage groups and marker orders was checked across the three different data sets and only loci showing consistent location over all or almost all of the data sets were kept. This resulted in a synthetic map consisting of 2226 markers and 29 linkage groups spanning over 3600 cM. Blastn searches against medaka, stickleback, and zebrafish genomic databases resulted in 778, 824 and 730 significant hits respectively while blastx searches yielded 505, 513 and 510 significant hits. Homology search results revealed that, for most rainbow trout chromosomes, large syntenic regions encompassing nearly whole chromosome arms have been conserved between rainbow trout and its closest models, medaka and stickleback. Large conserved <b>syntenies</b> were also found between the genomes of rainbow trout and the reconstructed teleost ancestor. These <b>syntenies</b> consolidated the known homeologous affinities between rainbow trout chromosomes due to the 4 th WGD and suggested new ones. Conclusions The synthetic map constructed herein further highlights the stability of the teleost genome over long evolutionary time scales. This map can be easily extended by incorporating new data sets and should help future rainbow trout whole genome sequence assembly. Finally, the persistence of large conserved <b>syntenies</b> across teleosts should facilitate the identification of candidate genes through comparative mapping, even if the occurrence of intra-chromosomal micro-rearrangement may hinder the accurate prediction their genomic location. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{genetic linkage}} {{map of the}} channel catfish genome (N = 29) was {{constructed}} using EST-based microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in an interspecific reference family. A total of 413 microsatellites and 125 SNP markers were polymorphic in the reference family. Linkage analysis using JoinMap 4. 0 allowed mapping of 331 markers (259 microsatellites and 72 SNPs) to 29 linkage groups. Each linkage group contained 3 – 18 markers. The largest linkage group contained 18 markers and spanned 131. 2 cM, while the smallest linkage group contained 14 markers and spanned only 7. 9 cM. The linkage map covered a genetic distance of 1811 cM with an average marker interval of 6. 0 cM. Sex-specific maps were also constructed; the recombination rate for females was 1. 6 times higher than that for males. Putative conserved <b>syntenies</b> between catfish and zebrafish, medaka, and Tetraodon were established, but the overall levels of genome rearrangements were high among the teleost genomes. This study represents a first-generation linkage map constructed by using EST-derived microsatellites and SNPs, laying a framework for large-scale comparative genome analysis in catfish. The conserved <b>syntenies</b> identified here between the catfish and the three model fish species should facilitate structural genome analysis and evolutionary studies, but more importantly should facilitate functional inference of catfish genes. Given that determination of gene functions is difficult in nonmodel species such as catfish, functional genome analysis will have to rely heavily on the establishment of orthologies from model species...|$|R
40|$|Zebrafish {{mutations}} {{define the}} functions of hundreds of essential genes in the vertebrate genome. To accelerate the molecular analysis of zebrafish mutations and to facilitate comparisons among the genomes of zebrafish and other vertebrates, we used a homozygous diploid meiotic mapping panel to localize polymorphisms in 691 previously unmapped genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Together with earlier efforts, this work raises {{the total number of}} markers scored in the mapping panel to 2119, including 1503 genes and ESTs and 616 previously characterized simple-sequence length polymorphisms. Sequence analysis of zebrafish genes mapped in this study and in prior work identified putative human orthologs for 804 zebrafish genes and ESTs. Map comparisons revealed 139 new conserved <b>syntenies,</b> in which two or more genes are on the same chromosome in zebrafish and human. Although some conserved <b>syntenies</b> are quite large, there were changes in gene order within conserved groups, apparently reflecting the relatively frequent occurrence of inversions and other intrachromosomal rearrangements since the divergence of teleost and tetrapod ancestors. Comparative mapping also shows {{that there is not a}} one-to-one correspondence between zebrafish and human chromosomes. Mapping of duplicate gene pairs identified segments of 20 linkage groups that may have arisen during a genome duplication that occurred early in the evolution of teleosts after the divergence of teleost and mammalian ancestors.
