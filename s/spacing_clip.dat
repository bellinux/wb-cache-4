40|$|Volumetric {{irregular}} grids are {{the next}} frontier to conquer in interactive 3 D graphics. Visualization algorithms for rectilinear 256 3 data volumes have been optimized to achieve one frame/second to 15 frames/second {{depending on the}} workstation. With equivalent computational resources, irregular grids with millions of cells may take minutes to render for a new viewpoint. The {{state of the art}} for graphics rendering, PixelFlow, provides screen and object space parallelism for polygonal rendering. Unfortunately volume rendering of irregular data is at odds with the sort last architecture. I investigate parallel algorithms for direct volume rendering on PixelFlow that generalize to other compositing architectures. Experiments are performed on the Nasa Langley fighter dataset, using the projected tetrahedra approach of Shirley and Tuchman. Tetrahedral sorting is done by the circumscribing sphere approach of Cignoni et al. Key approaches include sortfirst on sort-last, world <b>space</b> subdivision by <b>clipping,</b> rearrangeable linear compositing for any view angle, and static load balancing. The new world <b>space</b> subdivision by <b>clipping</b> provides for efficient and correct rendering of unstructured data by using object <b>space</b> <b>clipping</b> planes.

30|$|To {{determine}} the required length of vertical GHEs, {{one of the}} various parameters considered in the equation is the borehole thermal resistance (Bernier 2000), which {{is the ability of}} the GHE to resist heat transfer. Selecting appropriate materials and configurations to optimize the borehole thermal resistance can help decrease borehole length. To reduce the borehole thermal resistance of GHEs made with one or more U-pipe, advances were made to develop <b>space</b> <b>clips</b> holding pipes separately, thermally enhanced grout (Kavanaugh and Allan 1999; Allan and Kavanaugh 1999; Carlson 2000; Borinaga-Treviño et al. 2013 a, 2013 b) and thermally enhanced pipe (Raymond et al. 2011 a, 2011 c). Further work has recently been conducted on coaxial GHEs, where the exchanger consists of two pipes imbricated into each other. The impact of the flow rate and the pipe diameter and thermal conductivity on the heat transfer rate was investigated with numerical simulations (Zanchini et al. 2010). Detailed experimental work was performed in the field to evaluate the borehole thermal resistance of different coaxial GHE configurations, where the external flow channel was made of several small pipes (Acuña et al. 2011) or a flexible liner molding the borehole wall and avoiding the use of backfill material (Acuña and Palm 2013). An analytical solution was also developed to estimate the vertical temperature distribution in the ascending and descending pipe of a coaxial GHE to improve the analysis of thermal response tests (Beier et al. 2013).|$|R

It also forms an interesting but challenging computer vision task, as the visual data to match, i. e., still image and video clip are usually represented quite different-ly.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{feasibility}} of the video-assisted insertion {{of a new}} sutureless vascular prosthesis was studied. Methods: Seven sheep, weighing 25 to 35 kg, were operated on under general anesthesia. The animals were intubated with a single-lumen endotracheal tube {{and placed in the}} right lateral decubitus position. A thoracoscope was introduced in the 11 th intercostal space, and a minithoracotomy (4 to 5 cm) was performed in the seventh intercostal space. After retraction of the lung, a short segment (10 cm) of the descending thoracic aorta was exposed. Our prosthesis was made of Dacron and was specifically designed to be inserted without a suture. After systemic heparinization, the aorta was cross-clamped with two vascular clamps introduced into the thoracic cavity through two 5 -mm thoracic incisions. The aorta was either replaced (five cases) or bypass grafted (two cases). At the completion of the procedure, blood pressure was pharmacologically increased (5 mg intravenous bolus of epinephrine), and each anastomosis was checked for bleeding. All animals were killed, and the prosthesis was retrieved for macroscopic examination. Results: The procedure was completed in each case without extension of the minithoracotomy. Insertion of the prosthesis was easy and fast, and completion of each anastomosis required 10 to 15 minutes. A 3 - to 4 -mm <b>space</b> between each <b>clip</b> was sufficient for proper attachment. All procedures were performed in less than 120 minutes. No bleeding was observed at the level of each anastomosis, even when a sustained high blood pressure was induced. The proper insertion of the prosthesis and the absence of any anastomotic stenosis was confirmed by means of macroscopic examination. Conclusion: Video-thoracoscopic replacement or bypass grafting of the descending thoracic aorta was easy with this new sutureless vascular prosthesis. Minimally invasive vascular surgery might be facilitated with such a prosthesis. However, long-term animal studies are required before human implantation can be undertaken.

40|$|Most cameras detect colour {{by using}} sensors that {{separate}} red, {{green and blue}} wavelengths of light {{which is similar to}} the human eye. As such most colour information available for computer vision is represented in this trichromatic colour model, Red Green Blue or RGB. However this colour model is inadequate for most applications as objects requiring analysis are subject to the reflective properties of light, causing RGB colour to change across object surfaces. Many colour models have been borrowed from other disciplines which transform the RGB colour space into dimensions which are decorrelated to the reflective properties of light. Unfortunately signal noise is present in all acquired video, corrupting the image information. Fortunately most noise is statistically predictable, causing offsets from the true values following a Poisson distribution. When the standard deviation of a noise distribution is known, then noise can be stochastically predicted and accounted for. However transformations inside cameras and transformations between colour models often deform the image information in ways that make the noise distributions non-uniform over the colour model. When computer vision applications need to account for non-uniform noise, wider tolerances are required overall. This results in a loss of useful information and a reduction in discriminative power. This thesis has a focus on the linearity of signal noise distributions in colour representations which are decorrelated to the reflective properties of light. Existing colour models are described and each of their components examined with their strengths and weaknesses discussed. The results show that the proposed Signal Linear RGB (SLRGB) colour model achieves a transformation of the RGB colour space with uniform noise distributions along all axes under changes to camera properties. This colour space maintains a signal noise {{with a standard deviation of}} one unit across the space under changes of the camera parameters: white balance, exposure and gain. Experiments demonstrated that this proposed SLRGB model consistently provided improvements to linearity over RGB when used as a basis for other colour models. The proposed Minimum Weighted Colour Comparison (MWCC) method allows reflectively decorrelated colour models to make colour comparisons which counter the deforming effects of their coordinate systems. This was shown to provide substantial improvements to linearity tests in every case, making many colour models have a comparative noise linearity to undeformed colour models. The proposed Planar Hue Luminance Saturation (PHLS) and Spherical Hue Luminance Saturation (SHLS) colour models are decorrelated to reflective properties of light and allow for signal linear colour comparisons. When used for pixel classification of coloured objects the PHLS and SHLS colour models used only 0. 26 % and 0. 25 % of the colour volume to classify all of the objects, with the next best using 0. 88 % without MWCC and 0. 45 % with. The proposed Gamut Limit Invariant (GLI) colour model extends the decorrelation of reflective properties of light further by correcting for colours which are too bright and are clipped by the limits of the RGB <b>space.</b> When <b>clipping</b> occurs the properties become no longer decorrelated and shift. GLI models these changes to estimate the original values for clipped colours. The results show that this method improves decorrelation when performing pixel classification of coloured objects with varying proportions of clipped colours. Overall, the results show that the proposed framework of colour models and methods are a significant improvement over all prior colour models in enabling the most accurate information possible for processing colour images...|$|R
