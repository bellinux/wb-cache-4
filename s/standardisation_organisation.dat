50|$|In 2006 CEN sent a {{questionnaire}} {{on the use}} of Guide 6 to its technical committees. The results showed that 3 out of 275 CEN committees used the Guide 6. ANEC decided to propose to CEN how to take an initiative to change the situation. In 2007-2008, NEN - the Dutch <b>standardisation</b> <b>organisation</b> - and Standard Norge carried out a feasibility study within the European Mandate M/371. One of the findings was that the implementation of Guide 6 faced some difficulties. For this reason, NEN and CEN started an action to promote the use of Guide 6, and in December 2007 NEN proposed the installation of an CEN/CENELEC/BT/WG Accessibility for All. ANEC also supported the creation of such a working group. This {{led to the creation of}} the CEN/CENELEC/BT/WG CEN/CENELEC Guide 6 Implementation Mechanism. The working group held a preliminary meeting on 29 October 2008 and its first official meeting on 8 April 2009.|$|E
50|$|The UK government's {{definition}} of open standards applies to software interoperability, data and document formats. The criteria for open standards are {{published in the}} “Open Standards Principles” policy paper and are as follows.#Collaboration - the standard is maintained through a collaborative decision-making process that is consensus based and independent of any individual supplier. Involvement {{in the development and}} maintenance of the standard is accessible to all interested parties.#Transparency - the decision-making process is transparent, and a publicly accessible review by subject matter experts is part of the process.#Due process - the standard is adopted by a specification or <b>standardisation</b> <b>organisation,</b> or a forum or consortium with a feedback and ratification process to ensure quality.#Fair access - the standard is published, thoroughly documented and publicly available at zero or low cost. Zero cost is preferred but this should be considered on a case by case basis as part of the selection process. Cost should not be prohibitive or likely to cause a barrier to a level playing field.#Market support - other than in the context of creating innovative solutions, the standard is mature, supported by the market and demonstrates platform, application and vendor independence.#Rights - rights essential to implementation of the standard, and for interfacing with other implementations which have adopted that same standard, are licensed on a royalty free basis that is compatible with both open source and proprietary licensed solutions. These rights should be irrevocable unless there is a breach of licence conditions.|$|E

40|$|Standardisation is an {{important}} factor to pave the way onto the market for new and innovative robotic products and to foster market growth. Safety standards form the basis to establish a robotic product on the market and reduce legal risks for manufacturers. Other standards can help to dismantle trade barriers such as standards on terminology, coordinate systems, benchmarking and modular design. As the market for service robots constantly grows, the demand for standards in this area also constantly rises. Due to the large variety of service robot designs and application domains, existing and newly developed standards usually do not cover all service robots but are limited to certain environments and robot types. Different <b>standardisation</b> <b>organisations</b> have adopted different approaches to fill the existing gaps. As an effect, several new standardisation working groups have formed in ISO, but also in other <b>standardisation</b> <b>organisations.</b> These working groups are open to all interested stakeholders from industry, academia and general society including manufacturers, integrators and professional end users.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{share of}} {{distributed energy resources}} (DER) in electricity production requires new sources and techniques in grid support services to keep the quality and reliability of power supply high. Addressing this matter, DER systems are required to follow technical grid connection requirements determined by distribution system operators (DSOs). Currently, these requirements widely differ from country to country. Recent studies suggest developing unified grid connection requirements for DER on the international level. This unification currently is the main activity for DSOs and <b>standardisation</b> <b>organisations</b> {{in the field of}} grid-connected DER. To support this activity, the present article (i) offers a status report on recent studies relevant to the harmonisation of DER grid connection requirements, and (ii) identifies and discusses current DER grid connection guides, namely standards of international and European <b>standardisation</b> <b>organisations,</b> as well as regulation s of national DSOs from Austria, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Switzerland (German-speaking part) and the United Kingdom.

30|$|In summary, it {{is evident}} that W 3 C {{standard}} development has taken place over a period of approximately 20  years with many standard development projects overlapping in time. A strong growth in number of projects has been experienced over time.

Other organisations, organisation types, and countries have been involved in standards released during a varying number of the total 19  years of W 3 C standardisation.
