50|$|When beating egg whites, {{they are}} {{classified}} {{in three stages}} according to the <b>peaks</b> they <b>form</b> when the beater is lifted: soft, firm, and <b>stiff</b> <b>peaks.</b> Overbeaten eggs take on a dry appearance, and eventually collapse. Egg whites do not beat up correctly if {{they are exposed to}} any form of fat, such as cooking oils or the fats contained in egg yolk.|$|R

5000|$|Heavy body {{acrylics}} {{are typically}} {{found in the}} Artist and Student Grade paints. [...] "Heavy Body" [...] refers to the viscosity or thickness of the paint. They are {{the best choice for}} impasto or heavier paint applications and will hold a brush or knife stroke and even a medium <b>stiff</b> <b>peak.</b> Gel Mediums ("pigment-less paints") are also available in various viscosities and used to thicken or thin paints, as well as extend paints and add transparency.|$|R
50|$|According to most recipes, the yolks must be whipped {{until they}} swell to double their {{original}} volume. Some recipes also call for egg whites (1--2 whites for each 10 yolks), beaten separately to <b>stiff</b> <b>peaks</b> consistency and gently mixed into the yolks. The mixture is then poured into greased muffin forms (about 1/2 tablespoon each) and baked {{until they are}} firm but still without crust. The pieces are then boiled lightly in the syrup, which may be flavored with rum, vanilla, or orange peel.|$|R

These data {{can be described in}} terms of different multi-exponential models and can be numerically fitted using several well-known methods. Here we make a comparative analysis of the performance and stability of two models, the decay and <b>peak</b> <b>form,</b> and we consider different transformation methods for obtaining the <b>peak</b> <b>form.</b> For the numerical computations we use a nonlinear least squares (NLS) method and a method based on a first-kind Fredholm integral equation (FIE). Our analysis uses artificial data with three components (seven parameters including the background), and ten different levels of background, both the signal and the background contain Poisson distributed noise. Parameters derived using both models are acceptable (statistically consistent and on an average within ~ 1 % of the expected value) and no obvious preference is observed for any particular model, although there may be a suggestion that <b>peak</b> <b>form</b> data shows a smaller mean bias. This conclusion seems to be independent of the type of peak transformations investigated here. Furthermore, it is found that transformation of OSL decay data to a <b>peak</b> <b>form</b> gives better results than direct measurement of <b>peak</b> <b>form</b> data by, for example, varying the stimulation light intensity. The comparison of the two numerical methods suggests that the NLS method performs somewhat better than the FIE method; however, the latter has the advantage that it does not require the 2 user's judgement on the number of components in the data. Testing of the NLS procedure on a measured quartz time-resolved OSL signal (TR-OSL) transformed into <b>peak</b> <b>form</b> yielded reliable parameter estimates even when the signal intensity was deliberately reduced by a factor of sixteen...|$|R

5000|$|Chemical {{leavening}} agents {{include a}} weak base, such as baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) plus a weak acid, such as cream of tartar, lemon juice, or cultured buttermilk, {{to create an}} acid—base reaction that releases carbon dioxide. (Quick bread leavened specifically with baking soda is often called [...] "soda bread"). Baking powder contains both an acid and a base in dry powdered form, and simply needs a liquid medium in which to react. Other alternative leavening agents are egg whites mechanically beaten to <b>form</b> <b>stiff</b> <b>peaks,</b> {{as in the case}} of many waffle recipes, or steam, in the case of cream puffs. Nevertheless, in a commercial process, designated chemical leavening acids and bases are used to make gas production consistent and controlled. Examples of acid—base combinations include: ...|$|R

5000|$|The most {{traditional}} method, {{also known as}} the angel food cake method is as follows. First the egg whites, and possibly salt and cream of tartar, are mixed at a medium speed until a soft <b>peak</b> <b>forms.</b> Whipping continues while the sugar is slowly added. Once a hard <b>peak</b> is <b>formed,</b> [...] the flour is folded into the mixture of egg whites and sugar. This technique is done in order to disturb the foam as little as possible.|$|R
50|$|The lemon custard {{is usually}} {{prepared}} with egg yolks, lemon zest and juice, sugar, and, optionally, starch. This {{gives it a}} texture {{similar to that of}} a sturdy pudding. The meringue, which includes well beaten egg whites and sugar, is cooked on top of the pie filling. As the meringue bakes, air bubbles trapped inside the protein of the egg white will expand and swell. However, if the egg whites are beaten too much, or if a tiny amount of fat is allowed to contaminate the mixture, then the proteins {{will not be able to}} form the correct molecular structure when cooked, and the meringue may collapse when cooked. The meringue can be beaten into either soft or <b>stiff</b> <b>peaks.</b> The temperature the pie is baked at and the method by which sugar is added also determines the texture and durability of the meringue.|$|R
