5|$|Night Trap {{designer}} Rob Fulop was irked {{that his}} relatively tame game was being compared to Mortal Kombat, {{which features a}} character ripping the heart out of a defeated opponent. Nintendo senior vice president Howard Lincoln testified {{in front of the}} committee, stating Night Trap would never appear on a Nintendo system because it did not pass their guidelines. Fulop later explained that Lincoln was referring to the technical guidelines; the game could not run on a Nintendo system {{due to the lack of}} a CD-ROM drive, but Lincoln made it <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the game was unworthy of Nintendo's moral standards. Critics noted this as a deliberate move from Nintendo to distance themselves from the scandal and make Sega look unfavorable.|$|E
25|$|One legend says that, {{during the}} Edo period, on it stood a pine tree which shook {{even when there}} was no wind, {{producing}} an extremely pleasant <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a celestial creature was playing an instrument. According to another, the founder of the shrine, who was a Kamakura period samurai called Sasaki Moritsuna, saw the pine tree move very slightly and emit sounds like those of a koto, so he gave the cape its name.|$|E

25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} war resided in the candidacy of a Prussian prince to the throne of Spain –– France feared encirclement by an alliance between Prussia and Spain. The Hohenzollern prince's candidacy was withdrawn under French diplomatic pressure, but Otto von Bismarck goaded the French into declaring war by altering a telegram sent by William I. Releasing the Ems Telegram to the public, Bismarck made it <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the king had treated the French envoy in a demeaning fashion. Six days later, France declared war on Prussia and Southern German States immediately sided with Prussia.|$|E
25|$|Claire {{lives with}} Agnes and Tobias {{and appears to}} have no means of support except for them. Her main role in life {{seems to be to}} annoy and embarrass her sister. She is {{everything}} that Agnes dislikes. Claire makes the statement, after telling Tobias that he {{would be better off if}} he killed Agnes, Julia, and herself, that she will never know whether she wants to live until Agnes is dead. With this statement, Albee makes it <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Claire holds Agnes up as a role model, a model that she has never been able to reach. And instead of trying to reach it, she has done everything to live her life in a diametrically opposed manner.|$|E
25|$|Puccini left {{instructions}} that Riccardo Zandonai should finish the opera. Puccini's son Tonio objected, and eventually Franco Alfano {{was chosen to}} flesh out the sketches after Vincenzo Tommasini (who had completed Boito's Nerone after the composer’s death) and Pietro Mascagni were rejected. Puccini's publisher Tito Ricordi II decided on Alfano because his opera La leggenda di Sakùntala resembled Turandot in its setting and heavy orchestration. Alfano provided a first version of the ending with a few passages of his own, {{and even a few}} sentences added to the libretto which was not considered complete even by Puccini himself. After the severe criticisms by Ricordi and the conductor Arturo Toscanini, he was forced to write a second, strictly censored version that followed Puccini's sketches more closely, {{to the point where he}} did not set some of Adami's text to music because Puccini had not indicated how he wanted it to sound. Ricordi's real concern was not the quality of Alfano's work, but that he wanted the end of Turandot to <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it had been written by Puccini, and Alfano's editing had to be seamless. Of this version, about three minutes were cut for performance by Toscanini, and it is this shortened version that is usually performed.|$|E

500|$|Lead singer Smith {{announced}} that the band would explore a new direction on their next album, pursuing a new, rawer sound. The new sound materialised itself on the third album {{through the use of}} traditional synthesizers instead of the band's previous use of guitars. The producer of In This Light and on This Evening, Flood also increased the importance of [...] "vibe" [...] in the music's sound, making it darker than the previous two albums, while also attempting to make the album <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it had been recorded live.|$|E
500|$|The orchestral {{interlude}} Flight of the Bumblebee {{was composed}} (c. 1900) by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. It represents the turning of Prince Guidon into a bumblebee {{so he can}} fly away to visit his father, Tsar Saltan, in the opera The Tale of Tsar Saltan, although the music may reflect the flight of a bluebottle rather than a bumblebee. The music inspired Walt Disney to feature a bumblebee in his 1940 animated musical Fantasia and have it <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were flying {{in all parts of}} the theater. This early attempt at [...] "surround sound" [...] was unsuccessful, and the music was excluded from the film's release.|$|E
500|$|Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine {{described}} [...] "Don't Stop the Music" [...] {{as having}} a bouncy feel similar to Rihanna's 2006 single [...] "SOS". According to Fraser McAlpine of BBC's Chart Blog, Rihanna's vocals on the song <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she recorded them to a different backing track, [...] "then gave them to some nerdy beatmatcher with an extensive collection of dark electro and classic pop." [...] McAlpine compared the verses' vocal melody to that of Aaliyah's single [...] "Try Again", the chorus to Madonna's [...] "La Isla Bonita", and the base track to Eric Prydz-style trance music. After the release of Rihanna's single [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] in 2010, many critics compared its composition and structure to [...] "Don't Stop the Music".|$|E

500|$|On 22 October 2013, Warner Bros. {{released}} a deluxe edition of Moondance. It featured a newly remastered {{version of the}} original record, three CDs of previously unreleased music from the recording sessions, and a Blu-ray disc with high-resolution audio of the original album. The packaging included a linen-wrapped folio and a booklet with liner notes written by Scheiner and music journalist Alan Light. The deluxe reissue was met with widespread critical acclaim; Record Collector called it an aural [...] "marvel", while The Independent said the remastering [...] "strips away centuries of digital compression and makes the music <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you've never heard it properly". In Rolling Stone, Will Hermes felt the numerous outtakes possessed an intimate quality that compensated for lacking the [...] "sublime, brassy" [...] arrangements featured on {{the final version of}} Morrison's [...] "jazzy-pop masterpiece".|$|E
500|$|While Tse {{described}} Talbot's {{voice as}} [...] "sweet" [...] and [...] "beautiful", and Takiff called her [...] "a freak of nature, with a grown-up singing {{voice in the}} body of a (just-turned) 9-year-old", other reviewers were more critical. Jon Bream, of the Minneapolis Star Tribune, called the album [...] "more cloying than cute", and David Yonke, writing for The Blade, described Talbot's performance as [...] "little more than a novelty act because of the overly sappy backdrop". Yonke did praise Talbot for her [...] "impressive vocal skills", but considered her [...] "earnestness [...] wasted on arrangements that <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were ripped from a 1930s Shirley Temple songbook". Wayne Bledsoe, writing for ScrippsNews, said that Talbot [...] "has a great voice for a kid", but added that [...] "this album wore me out. Maybe it's the never-ending vibrato." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Zoo Station" [...] came {{together}} {{near the end}} of the recording sessions when audio engineer Flood was mixing the song and introduced distortion to the drums. The song's direction was largely influenced by the production team of Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, and Flood. Lead vocalist Bono had been disappointed with his vocals from early recording sessions for the album and told the production team, [...] "Let's just try something that's gonna put me in a completely different place". After they distorted his voice to make it <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were coming from a megaphone, Bono was inspired to sing in a persona, as the effect gave his vocals a different [...] "emotional feel". Flood mixed the final track with the assistance of Shannon Strong. Along with Robbie Adams, Strong also assisted Flood with engineering. Lanois provided additional guitar during recording.|$|E

500|$|Anniemal {{focuses on}} heavily layered beats, {{with a strong}} 1980s influence. Annie was {{influenced}} by 1980s dance-pop, and on [...] "No Easy Love", she includes a sample of Shakatak's 1982 song [...] "Easier Said Than Done". Unlike many of her contemporaries, Annie avoids using an ironic or kitschy in her take on 1980s music. The songs' styles span genres including bubblegum pop, electro, disco, R, dance-pop, and rock. Annie's DJing experiences taught her about sound and production and affected her music. She stated {{that she wanted to}} make a pop album that would not quickly become dated, [...] "an album that you could listen to in five years and it wouldn't sound terrible." [...] Annie considered excluding [...] "Greatest Hit" [...] from Anniemal to achieve this but ultimately included it because she felt it did not <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were five years old.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, {{the single}} {{received}} a positive review from Record Mirror, which said, [...] "Highly promising group with strong guitar sound and a compact sort of vocal performance. Mid-tempo but bustling song should sell well." [...] In Melody Maker, singer Dave Berry {{was featured in}} a blindfold test of the song, with Berry at first guessing the song was by the Kingsmen. He said, [...] "It's fabulous, this one. I like these records that <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they've gone into a recording studio and done {{what they wanted to}} on the spot. It's a good chance of being a big hit." [...] The Melody Maker review had a lasting impact on Ray Davies, who said that Berry [...] "had a few hits – so he mattered" [...] and that Berry's belief that the band had [...] "done what they wanted" [...] had [...] "said it all" [...] for him.|$|E
500|$|... "Good Hit" [...] {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} music critics. Poppy Reid of The Music Network criticized the song for {{its reliance on}} autotune and lyrics [...] "you just don't expect (or want) from a 41-year-old". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated {{in a review of}} Love? that apart from [...] "Good Hit" [...] and [...] "Invading My Mind", [...] "Lopez shines when the beat hits 120 or higher." [...] Robert Copsey from Digital Spy called the song generic. Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club was critical of the song, stating that: [...] " [...] in which she drones [...] "I got that good hit" [...] when she clearly doesn't—nor does she seem to even want it." [...] Scott Shetler of PopCrush noted [...] "Good Hit" [...] to <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Lopez was covering Britney Spears [...] "rather than doing her own thing." [...] Monica Herrera from Billboard agreed, comparing the song to Britney Spears' [...] "Piece of Me" [...] and additionally to the work of Nicki Minaj.|$|E
6000|$|... "Amen!" [...] {{answered}} a voice as sweet and [...] "soft as honey dew," [...] which <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{the words were}} spoken close by his bedside.|$|R

500|$|Devdutt Pattanaik from The Tribune {{commented that}} [...] "the writer takes us on a {{sinister}} journey with the characters, who frequently <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{they are one}} of us only." [...] Society magazine complimented Tripathi's writing by saying, [...] "Reading this beautifully written creation is like plunging into the icy and venerable waters of the Manasarovar Lake. One can actually sense the beats of Shiva's dumru and fumes of intoxicating chillum. Simply unputdownable." [...] Nandita Sengupta from The Times of India felt that [...] "while the author spins a tale of adventure, {{it could have been a}} slightly snappier, tighter read. Some crunching of thoughts that tended to overlap and repeat would be welcome in the next two books." [...] However, Sengupta was most impressed by the author's crafting of Shiva as a [...] "rough-hewn, hot-headed, a great dancer, smitten by Sati... Shiva's our definition of a hero, ready to fight for a good cause anytime." ...|$|E
500|$|Lessing {{said she}} was {{inspired}} to write The Good Terrorist by the IRA bombing of the Harrods department store in London in 1983. She recalled, [...] "the media reported it to <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it {{was the work of}} amateurs. I started to think, what kind of amateurs could they be?" [...] and realised [...] "how easy it would be for a kid, not really knowing what he or she was doing, to drift into a terrorist group." [...] Lessing already had Alice in mind as the central character: [...] "I know several people like Alice—this mixture of... maternal caring,... and who can contemplate killing large numbers of people without a moment's bother." [...] She described Alice as [...] "quietly comic" [...] because she is so full of contradictions. She {{said she was}} surprised how some of the characters (other than Jasper, Alice's love interest) developed, such as the pill-popping and fragile Faye, {{who turned out to be}} a [...] "destroyed person".|$|E
500|$|Pier Dominguez, {{author of}} A Star is Made, {{commented that the}} {{sessions}} demonstrated [...] "Christina's raw vocal agility" [...] despite calling the content [...] "dull", adding [...] "Christina's hunger for success actually comes through in these songs, as she sings her heart out with strained emotion, trying to <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she's letting all her inhibitions run free. If she did in fact co-write the songs then they were also a demonstration of Christina's songwriting dexterity, because the album's lyrics could be called unoriginal and perhaps even cheesy, {{it could not be}} said that they were not catchy". Similarly, Stephanie McGrath from JAM! Music also saw why Aguilera would not want the album released. Although she recognized Aguilera's potential as a vocalist, she wrote [...] "The songs themselves are terrible, dated club tracks, overwhelmed by poor effects and mundane beats." [...] Despite the negative critical reception, the album has sold over 128,000 copies in the United States and peaked at number 71 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
