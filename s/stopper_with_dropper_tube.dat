By contrast, many fungi (only ascomycetes and basidomycetes, as most other groups lack septa) contain septal pores − an unrelated phenomenon.|$|R

50|$|In 1969, Sieloff {{had made}} the change from VfB Stuttgart to Borussia Mönchengladbach. Their coach Hennes Weisweiler {{intended}} to strengthen the defense of his young team, which was already very strong offensively, but lacked the defensive thoroughness to succeed in a long league campaign. For the 1969-70 season, Mönchengladbach added Sieloff as sweeper as well as Ludwig Müller as the <b>stopper.</b> <b>With</b> the defense strengthened, Borussia Mönchengladbach won the 1969-70 and the 1970-71 Bundesliga seasons.|$|R

5000|$|Particularly for {{intravenous}} administration, self-injection {{in the arm}} can be awkward, {{and some}} people modify a syringe for single-handed operation by removing the plunger and affixing a bulb such as from a large dropper or baby pacifier {{to the end of}} the barrel to in effect make it a large <b>dropper</b> <b>with</b> a needle affixed. This is therefore a variant of the common method of injection <b>with</b> a <b>dropper</b> <b>with</b> the hypodermic needle affixed, using a [...] "collar" [...] made of paper or other material to create a seal between the needle and dropper. Removing part of the plunger assembly by cutting off most of the shaft and thumb rest and affixing the bulb {{to the end of the}} barrel, thereby allowing the bulb to operate the plunger by suction, also does work in many cases.|$|R

50|$|Port, {{like other}} wine, should {{be stored in}} a cool but not cold, dark {{location}} (as light can damage the port), with a steady temperature (such as a cellar), laying the bottle on its side if the bottle has a cork, or standing up if <b>stoppered.</b> <b>With</b> the exception of white port, which can be served chilled, port should be served at between 15 and 20 degrees Celsius (59 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit). Tawny port may also be served slightly cooler.|$|R
5000|$|A {{pycnometer}} (from Greek: πυκνός (puknos) meaning [...] "dense"), {{also called}} pyknometer or specific gravity bottle, is a device {{used to determine}} the density of a liquid. A pycnometer is usually made of glass, with a close-fitting ground glass <b>stopper</b> <b>with</b> a capillary tube through it, so that air bubbles may escape from the apparatus. This device enables a liquid's density to be measured accurately by reference to an appropriate working fluid, such as water or mercury, using an analytical balance.|$|R
5000|$|Wine {{bottle openers}} are {{required}} to open wine bottles that are <b>stoppered</b> <b>with</b> a cork. They are slowly being supplanted by the screwcap closure. There are many different inceptions of the wine bottle opener ranging from the simple corkscrew, the screwpull lever, to complicated carbon dioxide driven openers. The most popular is the wine key, sommelier knife or [...] "waiter's friend" [...] which resembles a pocket knife and has a small blade for cutting foil and a screw with a bottle brace.|$|R

60|$|I glanced towards him; it {{was true}} enough, Leo was in his death-struggle. I saw his poor face turning ashen, and heard the breath begin to rattle in his throat. The phial was <b>stoppered</b> <b>with</b> {{a little piece of}} wood. I drew it with my teeth, and a drop of the fluid within flew out upon my tongue. It had a sweet flavour, and for a second made my head swim, and a mist gather before my eyes, but happily the effect passed away as swiftly as it had arisen.|$|R
50|$|Common in U.S. bars, {{these devices}} {{consist of a}} simple rubber or plastic <b>stopper</b> <b>with</b> a metal or plastic tube fitted into it, and often a second smaller tube {{extending}} down into the bottle, designed to replace the cap or cork on a bottle of liquor. The spout, in the U.S., is usually calibrated to allow a flow of 1 fluid ounce per second, so that a bartender can measure accurate and consistent shots of liquor or portions for cocktails based on timed pours, without needing to use a jigger or other measuring device.|$|R
50|$|Vino-Seal is a plastic/glass closure {{released}} by Alcoa. Since its introduction into the European market in 2003, over 300 wineries have utilized Vino-Seal. Using a glass <b>stopper</b> <b>with</b> an inert o-ring, the Vino-Seal creates a hermetic seal that prevents oxidation and TCA contamination. A disadvantage with the Vino-Seal is {{the relatively high}} cost of each plug (70 cents each) and cost of manual bottling {{due to the lack}} of compatible bottling equipment outside of Europe. Vinolok is a glass stopper developed and produced by a Czech crystal glass producer Preciosa.|$|R
