It processes {{much of its}} {{spent fuel}} at Sellafield on the northwest coast across from Ireland, where nuclear waste is vitrified and sealed in stainless steel canisters for dry storage above ground for at least 50 years before eventual deep geologic disposal. Sellafield {{has a history of}} environmental and safety problems, including a fire in a nuclear plant in Windscale, and a <b>significant</b> <b>incident</b> in 2005 at the main reprocessing plant (THORP).|$|E

Maritime and American privateers targeted unprotected shipping of both the United States and Britain respectively, further reducing trade. New Brunswick's section of the Canada–US border {{did not have any}} significant action during this conflict, although British forces did occupy a portion of coastal Maine at one point.

The only hostile engagement the Luftwaffe took part in over Denmark was {{on the first day of}} the invasion, when a flight of Bf 110s of 1./ZG 1 (Zerstörergeschwader 1) shot down one Fokker CV taking off on a reconnaissance mission from Vaerlose airfield. The remaining machines were either destroyed or severely damaged by ground strafing. Denmark was virtually overrun within 24 hours and capitulated. The surviving Danish aircraft were first impounded and later on in the war confiscated and used for training purposes by the Luftwaffe.

Paulinho's teammate Peter Sagan had also been hit by a motorbike on stage 8 and the team had issued a statement calling for an apology from the race organisers and measures to prevent such incidents.
