60|$|When we wakened in {{the morning}} the storm was over and a young morning was looking through rosy eyelids across a white world. The little {{clearing}} around Peg's cabin was heaped with dazzling drifts, and we boys fell to and shovelled out a road to her well. She gave us breakfast--stiff oatmeal porridge without milk, and a boiled egg apiece. Cecily could NOT eat her porridge; she declared she had such a bad cold that she had no appetite; a cold she certainly had; the rest of us choked our messes down and after we had done so Peg asked us if we had noticed a <b>soapy</b> <b>taste.</b>|$|E

50|$|Parma Violets {{were created}} in 1946 by the Derbyshire company Swizzels Matlow. They are sweets that are hard, biconcave discs, based on similar aniseed candy {{traditionally}} consumed in India after a spicy meal. Their flavour {{has been described as}} sweet with a <b>soapy</b> or floral <b>taste.</b> The current recipe includes sugar, stearic acid, modified starch, glucose syrup, and anthocyanin.|$|R
50|$|Expressed {{breast milk}} can be stored. Lipase may cause thawed milk to <b>taste</b> <b>soapy</b> or rancid due to milk fat breakdown. It is still safe to use, and most babies will drink it. Scalding it will prevent rancid taste {{at the expense}} of antibodies. It should be stored with {{airtight}} seals. Some plastic bags are designed for storage periods of less than 72 hours. Others can be used for up to 12 months if frozen. This table describes safe storage time limits.|$|R
50|$|Soapberry plants {{exist as}} either {{male or female}} plants, however only the females produce berries. When soapberries are ripe for harvest, they will possess a variety of {{defining}} features. The first is color, being shades between that of orange and red and marginally translucent. The second feature that should be observed before harvesting {{is the size of}} the soapberry. A ripe soapberry is about 1/4-inch or less in diameter. The third defining characteristic of a ripe soapberry is its texture. If crushed, the ripe berries will produce a <b>soapy</b> foam. Finally, <b>taste</b> {{can be used as a}} measure of ripeness. Deemed by its bitter effects on the palate, a soapberry can be considered ready for harvest via taste. Soapberries are harvested in dry areas during the summer months of July, August, and September.|$|R
5000|$|Ammonium {{bicarbonate}} {{is used in}} {{the food}} industry as a raising agent for flat baked goods, such as cookies and crackers, and in China in steamed buns and Chinese almond cookies. It was commonly used in the home before modern day baking powder was made available. In China it is called edible or food-grade [...] "smelly powder". Many baking cookbooks (especially from Scandinavian countries) may still refer to it as hartshorn or hornsalt [...] (e.g., FI: [...] "hirvensarvisuola", NO: [...] "hjortetakksalt", DK: [...] "hjortetakssalt", SE: [...] "hjorthornssalt", [...] "salt of hart's horn", DE: [...] "Hirschhornsalz"). Although there is a slight smell of ammonia during baking, this quickly dissipates, leaving no taste. It is used in, for example, Swedish [...] "drömmar" [...] biscuits and Danish Christmas biscuits (Hjortetakssalt), and German Lebkuchen. In many cases it may be substituted with baking soda or baking powder or a combination of both, depending on the recipe composition and leavening requirements. Compared to baking soda or potash, hartshorn has the advantage of producing more gas for the same amount of agent, and of not leaving any salty or <b>soapy</b> <b>taste</b> in the finished product, as it completely decomposes into water and gaseous products that evaporate during baking. It cannot be used for moist, bulky baked goods however, such as normal bread or cakes, since some ammonia will be trapped inside and will cause an unpleasant taste.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of using CBS {{in this research}} {{is to improve the}} physical properties and quality of appereance and structure stability of chocolate bar. Based on chemical composition, CBS and Cocoa butter have different profile, but they have similar physical properties due to high lauric acid content. The advantage of lauric acid is to affect shinny appreance of chocolate surface, and also <b>soapy</b> <b>taste</b> that closely related to rancidity reduction. Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) is one of lauric fat that easily found in Aceh. In this research, chocolate bar is formulated comprising various concentration of CBS (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 %) with respect to cocoa butter, and cocoa mass composition (200 g and 300 g). It was found that melting point was affected by CBS concentration. The higher CBS concentration, the lower melting point of chocolate bar. An increase in VCO concentration reduced significantly the melting point of chocolate bar. Melting point was comparable to other chocolate bar commercial (29 - 32 oC). The unblooming, snap, best texture and better taste was observed for the chocolate bar containing 4 - 5 % of VCO concentration and 27, 5 % of cocoa mas...|$|E
40|$|The {{leaves of}} the Coriandrum sativum plant, known as cilantro or coriander, are widely used in many cuisines around the world. However, {{far from being a}} benign culinary herb, cilantro can be {{polarizing}} [...] -many people love it while others claim that it tastes or smells foul, often like soap or dirt. This soapy or pungent aroma is largely attributed to several aldehydes present in cilantro. Cilantro preference is suspected to have a genetic component, yet to date nothing is known about specific mechanisms. Here we present the results of a genome-wide association study among 14, 604 participants of European ancestry who reported whether cilantro <b>tasted</b> <b>soapy,</b> with replication in a distinct set of 11, 851 participants who declared whether they liked cilantro. We find a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) significantly associated with soapy-taste detection that is confirmed in the cilantro preference group. This SNP, rs 72921001, (p= 6. 4 e- 9, odds ratio 0. 81 per A allele) lies within a cluster of olfactory receptor genes on chromosome 11. Among these olfactory receptor genes is OR 6 A 2, which has a high binding specificity for several of the aldehydes that give cilantro its characteristic odor. We also estimate the heritability of cilantro soapy-taste detection in our cohort, showing that the heritability tagged by common SNPs is low, about 0. 087. These results confirm that there is a genetic component to cilantro taste perception and suggest that cilantro dislike may stem from genetic variants in olfactory receptors. We propose that OR 6 A 2 may be the olfactory receptor that contributes to the detection of a soapy smell from cilantro in European populations...|$|R
