A qualitative case study with a phenomenological flavour was chosen as research design. A single school was selected and data generated using interviews, observations, photos and artefacts. The findings suggest that the needs and problems of the <b>science</b> <b>teachers</b> in this case study are not sufficiently addressed through professional development programmes.
