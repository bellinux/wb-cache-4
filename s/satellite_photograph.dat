The route can still be traced on a modern aerial or <b>satellite</b> <b>photograph.</b> In 1937 Australian Iron and Steel (later a subsidiary of BHP and then BHP Billiton) acquired the colliery for its Port Kembla steelworks.

500|$|Palmer {{had long}} been {{interested}} in UFOs, and ran an article in Other Worlds in 1951 titled [...] "I Flew in a Flying Saucer", bylined [...] "Captain A.V.G.", though Lester del Rey reports in his history of sf magazines {{that it may have}} been written by Palmer himself. [...] Eventually Palmer decided to drop science fiction; from June 1957 only three issues—June, July and September—included fiction; thereafter it was a nonfiction magazine about UFOs. He wrote in the following issue that he would print news of flying saucers and rumors, and would debunk any claims he could prove fake. [...] Over the next twenty years he included such fringe ideas such as that the earth was not spherical, and in December 1959 ran an article in Flying Saucers that claimed the earth was shaped like a donut, and that flying saucers originated from an unexplored source on the earth's surface. [...] In 1965 Palmer published an article by Delmar H. Bryant that debunked the idea that the earth was hollow, but the following year again suggested that the earth might be donut shaped. [...] On the June 1970 issue, the cover picture showed a donut-shaped earth from space; Palmer claimed this was evidence from a <b>satellite</b> <b>photograph.</b>|$|E
