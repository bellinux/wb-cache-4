5|$|Dave Pear, the Buccaneers' first Pro Bowl {{selection}} and most popular player, {{was traded to}} the Oakland Raiders for two draft picks. This was partly to get extra help in what was expected to be a strong offensive draft, but also because Pear had requested that he be traded if his contract could not be renegotiated. Dave Green, the punter and kicker through the first three seasons, had to be replaced when he tore his achilles tendon <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> a tackling dummy in training camp.|$|E
5|$|At {{a luncheon}} later that day, however, Miranda announces {{that it is}} Jacqueline instead of Nigel who will leave Runway for Holt. Nigel remarks to a stunned Andy that, though disappointed, he has to believe that his loyalty to Miranda will one day pay off. Later, when Miranda and Andy are being driven to a show, she {{explains}} to a still-stunned Andy that she {{was grateful for the}} warning but already knew of the plot to replace her and sacrificed Nigel to keep her own job. Pleased by this display of loyalty, she tells Andy that she sees a great deal of herself in her. Andy, repulsed, says she could never do that to anyone. Miranda replies that she already did, <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> Emily when she agreed to go to Paris. When they stop, Andy gets out and throws her cell phone into the fountain of the Place de la Concorde, leaving Miranda, Runway, and fashion behind.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is often}} {{considered}} taboo to <b>step</b> <b>over</b> people, {{or parts of}} their body, {{who are on the}} ground. It is often said that it will prevent the person from growing (if they are not fully grown already). It is better to politely ask the person to move or to find a way around them. If one accidentally <b>steps</b> <b>over</b> a person (or people), it is sometimes standard to <b>step</b> backwards <b>over</b> them.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, U.S. Naval {{intelligence}} had strongly ascertained {{that the}} Japanese were planning {{an attack on}} the Central Pacific island of Midway. Admiral Chester Nimitz, Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, determined to take the opportunity to engage them. Losing Midway would have been a very serious threat because the Japanese then could easily take Hawaii and threaten the West Coast of the United States. The loss of his most aggressive and combat experienced carrier admiral, Halsey, on the eve of this crisis was a severe blow to Nimitz. Nimitz met with Halsey, who recommended his cruiser division commander, Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance, to take command for the upcoming Midway operation. Nimitz considered the move, but it would mean <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> Rear Admiral Frank Fletcher of Task Force 17, who was the senior of the two men. After interviewing Fletcher and reviewing his reports from the Coral Sea engagement, Nimitz was convinced that Fletcher's performance was sound, and he was given the responsibility of command in the defense of Midway. Acting upon Halsey's recommendations, Nimitz then made Rear Admiral Spruance commander of Halsey's Task Force 16, comprising the carriers Enterprise and Hornet. To aid Spruance, who had no experience as the commander of a carrier force, Halsey sent along his irascible chief of staff, Captain Miles Browning. The ensuing harrowing Battle of Midway was a crucial turning point in the war for the United States and a dramatic victory for the U.S. Navy.|$|E

500|$|The {{ceremony}} {{leading up}} to the tug of war begins at around midnight {{on the eve of the}} festival. Both teams repair to their respective ropes and offer prayers for victory; this rite is known as goyu (...) [...] During this time, the teams guard their ropes against tampering, as well as preventing members of the opposing team from <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> it (it is believed that a woman who steps over the rope at this time will conceive a male heir). Punishments can be severe; there are records of a woman being stoned to death in the early 20th century for such an infraction. The teams then gather at the festival site and perform further prayers, this time for the safety and prosperity of the village; sacrifices are also offered to Teojushin, the earth goddess. These communal rituals are called gosa (...) [...] At dawn, after the completion of these ceremonies, the two teams fetch their ropes to the site; this involves a procession with flags and costumes, accompanied by percussion music. There is then a staged debate over the connection of the two ropes, which has a symbolic sexual aspect; innuendo and bawdy taunts of the other team are common.|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, some users also {{alleged that}} their Windows 7 and 8.1 devices had {{automatically}} begun upgrading to 10 without their consent. In June 2016, the GWX dialog's behavior changed to make closing the window imply a consent to a scheduled upgrade. Despite this, an Infoworld editor disputed the claims that upgrades had begun without any consent at all; testing {{showed that the}} upgrade to Windows10 would only begin once the user accepts the end-user license agreement (EULA) presented by its installer, and that not doing so would eventually cause Windows Update to time out with an error, thus halting the installation attempt. It was concluded that these users may have unknowingly clicked the [...] "Accept" [...] prompt without full knowledge that this would begin the upgrade. In December 2016, Microsoft chief marketing officer Chris Capossela admitted {{that the company had}} [...] "gone too far", by using this tactic, stating that [...] "we know we want people to be running Windows 10 from a security perspective, but finding the right balance where you’re not <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> the line of being too aggressive is something we tried and {{for a lot of the}} year I think we got it right." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{spinal cord}} executes rhythmical and {{sequential}} activation of [...] muscles in locomotion. The {{central pattern generator}} (CPG) provides the basic locomotor rhythm and synergies by integrating commands from various sources that serve to initiate or modulate its output {{to meet the requirements}} of the environment. CPG within the lumbosacral spinal cord segments represent {{an important component of the}} total circuitry that generates and controls posture and locomotion. This spinal circuitry can function independently in the absence of descending input from the brain to generate stable posture and locomotion and even modulate activity to match changing conditions (e.g., <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> obstacles). This capability improve with training (spinal plasticity) and therefore it is believed that spinal cord has the capability to learn and memorize.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} Imus was suspended.

Comedian Bill Maher said that if a comedian apologizes for <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> a line, that should suffice. Steve Adubato, an MSNBC media analyst, disagreed, saying that this incident was [...] "not isolated". Joe Klein made the same charge, referring to Imus's comment about New York Times reporter Gwen Ifill 14 years before as evidence of a pattern of offensive comments. On The View, Rosie O'Donnell spoke out in support of keeping Imus on the air on free speech grounds, while Emil Steiner of The Washington Post argued that Al Sharpton used the issue to further divide America along racial lines.|$|E
2500|$|Vanessa is {{described}} by the BBC as [...] "scheming", [...] "conniving and calculated".

[...] As part of the character's costume, she wears black, thick-rimmed glasses. Due to Ash's disability, Vanessa uses a walking stick. Ash commented: [...] "Disability is misrepresented on television and it's really fantastic that it did not worry the production team I was disabled." [...] Of Vanessa's backstory, Ash explained: [...] "She rose through the ranks from a nurse to become a CEO rather easily and we can only imagine that she’s done it by <b>stepping</b> <b>over</b> people along the way. But with a smile on her face." [...] With regards to Vanessa's nursing background and the difference it made to her position, Ash explained: [...] "They’re all so used to CEOs being very bureaucratic. I think it’s quite a shock to find someone who knows the medical side of things. They can’t get away with things, because she understands what’s going on." ...|$|E
