40|$|Packet loss in IP {{networks}} can be congestive due to IP interrupt queue overflow on the nodes, and non-congestive due to hardware failure, <b>signal-fading</b> or obstacles. Recognition of {{two types}} of losses can largely help TCP endpoints in making right decisions. In this paper we apply the Visualized IP-based Network Simulator (VINS) to characterize the key differences between congestive packet losses and that of due to link disruption, which is noncongestive and commonly seen in wireless networks. Based on the analyses, suggested improvements for wireless TCP endpoints are proposed on both kernel and application levels in terms of avoiding useless keep-alive probing and congestion window tuning, but re-routing and re-establishing new connections. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} gather {{information}} about the occurrence of ducting/superrefraction and <b>signal-fading</b> effects at frequencies around 300 MHz with antenna heights appropriate to intership communications, an experimental investigation has been undertaken with a transmitter and two receivers deployed in the British Channel Islands. Signal strength measurements made {{over a period of}} 17 months for a path from Jersey to Guernsey from April 2001 to September 2002 and 8 months of data for a path from Jersey to Alderney from November 2001 to September 2002 have been analyzed. Comparisons have been made between the received signal characteristics and several meteorological parameters such as sea state, weather conditions, and season, and the statistics of the occurrence of enhancements in signal strength due to superrefraction and ducting are presented...|$|E
40|$|In the {{traditional}} centralized cooperative spectrum sensing, all secondary users sense the same channel. But, {{for a given}} channel, there exists detection performance diversity among all the users, due to the different <b>signal-fading</b> process. Involving the user with poor performance in cooperative sensing will not only deteriorate the detection correctness but also waste the sensing time. In the heterogeneous channels, the problem is even severe. A novel idea is to allocate the secondary users to sense different channels. We analyze the allocation problem before formulate {{it to be an}} optimization problem, which is a NP-hard problem. Then we propose the declined complexity algorithm in equal secondary user case and the two-hierarchy approach algorithm in unequal case. With the simulation, we verify the near optimality of the proposed algorithms and the advantage of the task allocation...|$|E
40|$|High data-rate {{atmospheric}} optical free-space (FSO) lasercom systems typically {{suffer from}} relatively long link degradations. They {{are caused by}} pointing- and tracking-errors or deep <b>signal-fades</b> produced by index of refraction turbulence effects. Based on measurement results we will present in this paper a channel characterization model for freespace optical links. Further a forward-error-correction (FEC) coding scheme is introduced which is able to overcome these link outages. The performance of these codes has been proven by measurements. Code design recommendations and validation test results are discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{emergence of}} data services for mobile applications requires high-speed communication technologies. To this end, free-space optical (FSO) communications technology {{has the potential}} to outperform radio frequency (RF) systems. Within the last years, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has performed several demonstrations of mobile FSO systems. A brief overview of these activities is given in this paper. Mobil FSO mainly suffers from relatively long link outages, produced by temporary obscured laser-beams, pointing- and trackingerrors or deep <b>signal-fades</b> caused by index of refraction turbulence effects. Error correction and retransmission techniques for fading mitigation are discussed in this paper. Comparison of FEC and protocol based error correction for mobile FSO transmission is presented...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the operational phase of the NASA Research Center's Advanced Communication Technology Satellite (ACTS), <b>signal-fade</b> measurements have been recorded at the NASA Ground Station located in Cleveland, Ohio, {{with the use of the}} 20 - and 30 -GHz beacon signals. Compilations of the daily data have been statistically analyzed on a monthly and yearly basis. Such analyses have yielded relevant parameters as (1) cumulative monthly and yearly probability distributions of signal attenuation by rain, (2) attenuation duration versus attenuation threshold probabilities, and (3) rate-of-fade probabilities. Not only are such data needed for a realistic data base to support the design and performance analysis of future satellite systems, but they are necessary to assess predictions made with the ACTS Rain Attenuation Prediction Model...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel design for {{quadrature}} phase detection utilizing two-mode optical waveguides for optical interferometric systems. A pair of interferometric signals having quadrature optical phase {{information can be}} obtained from the near-field and far-field patterns of a two-mode waveguide output. The operational principle is based on a 7 r/ 2 differential phase shift between two modal beams occurring during their transition from near-field to far-field radiation patterns. One of the complications in fiber-optic interferometric systems for use in sensors or coherent communications is associated with the cyclic response of the photode-tector output to the optical phase shift. The sensitiv-ity of optical phase change measurements fluctuates between its maximum value and zero, depending on the phase bias that is easily influenced by environmen-tal parameters such as temperature: the so-called <b>signal-fading</b> problem. A commonly used technique to avoid this problem is to generate heterodyne signal...|$|E
40|$|Fast {{amplitude}} variations due to atmospheric scintillation are {{the main}} concerns for the Deep Space Network (DSN) Ka-band downlink under clear weather con-ditions. A theoretical study of the amplitude scintillation variances for a finite aperture antenna is presented. Amplitude variances for weak scattering scenarios are examined using turbulence theory to describe atmospheric irregularities. We first apply the Kolmogorov turbulent spectrum to a point receiver for three dif-ferent turbulent profile models, especially for an exponential model varying with altitude. These analytic solutions then are extended to a receiver with a finite aperture antenna for the three profile models. Smoothing effects of antenna aper-ture are expressed by gain factors. A group of scaling factor relations is derived to show the dependences of amplitude variances on signal wavelength, antenna size, and elevation angle. Finally, we use these analytic solutions to estimate the scin-tillation intensity for a DSN Goldstone 34 -m receiving station. We find that the (rms) amplitude fluctuation is 0. 13 dB at 20 -deg elevation angle for an exponen-tial model, while the fluctuation is 0. 05 dB at 90 deg. These results will aid us in telecommunication system design and <b>signal-fading</b> prediction. They also provide a theoretical basis for further comparison with other measurements at Ka-band.

40|$|A rapid <b>signal-fading</b> event {{produced}} by diffractive scintillations was observed around 0123 UT on 8 November 2004 by three closely sited (less than 250 m apart) GPS scintillation receivers in northern Norway. The entire {{duration of the}} event was about 10 s and was recorded by all three receivers. Intense, short duration events such as these are not clearly observable in the 1 -min scintillation index (S 4) {{because they do not}} necessarily last for the entire minute. In spite of their short duration they can cause a receiver to lose lock because of their intensity. The geomagnetic conditions were disturbed at this time with the interplanetary magnetic field southward for a period of several hours. Magnetometers from the IMAGE network in Scandinavia showed evidence of a 2000 nT substorm. The GPS measurements are compared with all-sky camera (ASC) data to show that the signal fades {{can be attributed to the}} GPS ray paths crossing electron density structures associated with the aurora. The ASC images reveal moving auroral structures at the same time as the GPS signals show movement of the ionospheric regions causing fading. The results indicate that at high latitudes low-elevation GPS signals can suffer sudden fading due to E-region auroral events. This is the first time that a direct connection has been established between the loss of lock on a GPS receiver and diffractive fading caused by auroral precipitation...|$|E
40|$|The mobile free-space {{optical channel}} mainly suffers from {{relatively}} long link outages, produced by short-term blockings of the line-of-sight (obstacles, clouds), pointing- and tracking-errors or deep <b>signal-fades</b> caused by {{index of refraction}} turbulence effects. This paper discusses the applicability of commonly used communication protocols like UDP, TCP, ARQ and the SCPS-TP from the Space Communications Protocol Standards (SCPS) in various scenarios. The performance of the protocols in the selected scenarios is evaluated using the simulation software OMNeT++. The simulations are based on channel measurements from the three FSO demonstrations FASOLT (61 km Ground â€“ Ground link), KIODO (LEO satellite downlink), and ATENAA (land-mobile link) and from ongoing measurements at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) (short-range Ground - Ground) {{as part of the}} MINERVAA project. Based on the simulation results, recommendations for protocols in free-space optical communication scenarios are given...|$|R
