In this study, <b>surface</b> <b>contamination</b> was simulated by applying 0. 5  mm height roughness over the entire upper surface of the airfoil. The distribution density varied from the leading edge to the trailing edge of the model. Our data show that this particular airfoil was very sensitive to <b>surface</b> <b>contamination</b> and its maximum lift coefficient decreased up to 35 %, while the stall angle of attack increased slightly. The <b>surface</b> <b>contamination,</b> however, caused very smooth stall characteristics and less lift drop in the post stall region.

The thickness of the films is varied {{in the range of}} 1 - 50 nm. ALD samples are used as references with well-controlled composition and thickness, as well as with a good lateral homogeneity. The homogeneity is checked using mapping ellipsometry. Optical models of increasing complexity were developed to take into account both the top (surface roughness on the nanometer scale) and bottom interfaces (buried silicon oxide and interface roughness). The best ellipsometric model was the one using a single interface roughness layer.
