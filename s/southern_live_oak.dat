5|$|Due to Oklahoma's {{location}} at {{the confluence of}} many geographic regions, the state's climatic regions have {{a high rate of}} biodiversity. Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairie, harbor expansive ecosystems in the state's central and western portions, although cropland has largely replaced native grasses. Where rainfall is sparse in the state's western regions, shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems, though pinyon pines, red cedar (junipers), and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the panhandle's far western reaches. Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare, disjunct species including sugar maple, bigtooth maple, nolina and <b>Southern</b> <b>live</b> <b>oak.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{flora and}} fauna {{are similar to those}} found in the mid-south and low country regions of South Carolina and Georgia. The palm trees are the more cold-hardy {{varieties}} like the state tree, the Sabal palmetto. Pines, magnolias, hickories, and a variety of oaks are the dominant trees. The <b>Southern</b> <b>Live</b> <b>Oak</b> is perhaps the most emblematic of the city.|$|E

Near the bases of hammocks sharp saw palmettos (Serenoa repens) flourish, making the hammocks very difficult to penetrate. Water in sloughs flow around the islands creating moats.

500|$|Small {{islands of}} trees growing on land raised between [...] and [...] above sloughs and prairies are called {{tropical}} hardwood hammocks. They may range from one (4,000m²) to ten acres (40,000m²) in area, and appear in freshwater sloughs, sawgrass prairies, or pineland. Hammocks are slightly elevated on limestone plateaus risen several {{inches above the}} surrounding peat, or they may grow on land that has been unharmed by deep peat fires. Hardwood hammocks exhibit a mixture of subtropical and hardwood trees, such as <b>Southern</b> <b>live</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus virginiana), gumbo limbo (Bursera simaruba), royal palm (Roystonea), and bustic (Dipholis salicifolia) that grow in very dense clumps.

50|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>live</b> <b>oak</b> is {{cultivated}} in warmer climates as a specimen tree or for shade {{in the southern}} United States (zone 8 and south) and in the warmer parts of the United States, Europe, and Australia. Cultivation is relatively simple, as <b>Southern</b> <b>live</b> <b>oak</b> seedlings grow fast with ample soil moisture.

50|$|The primary {{uses for}} <b>southern</b> <b>live</b> <b>oaks</b> today are {{providing}} {{food and shelter}} for wildlife. Among the animals for which <b>live</b> <b>oak</b> acorns are an important food source are the bobwhite quail, the threatened Florida scrub jay, the wood duck, yellow-bellied sapsucker, wild turkey, black bear, various species of squirrel, and the white-tailed deer. The tree crown is very dense, making it valuable for shade, and the species provides nest sites for many mammal species. Native Americans extracted a cooking oil from the acorns, used all parts of <b>live</b> <b>oak</b> for medicinal purposes, leaves for making rugs, and bark for dyes. The roots of seedlings sometimes form starchy, edible tubers. People in past centuries harvested and fried these tubers for human consumption much as one might use a potato.|$|R
500|$|Hammocks {{are often}} the only dry land within the park. They rise several inches above the grass-covered river, and are {{dominated}} by diverse plant life consisting of subtropical and tropical trees, such as large <b>southern</b> <b>live</b> <b>oaks</b> (Quercus virginiana). Trees often form canopies under which animals thrive amongst scrub bushes of wild coffee (Psychotria), white indigoberry (Randia aculeata), poisonwood (Metopium toxiferum) and saw palmetto (Serenoa repens). The park features thousands of these tree islands amid sloughs—which often form {{the shape of a}} teardrop when seen from above (see park map) because of the slowly moving water around them—but they can also be found in pineland and mangroves. Trees in the Everglades, including wild tamarind (Lysiloma latisiliquum) and gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba), rarely grow higher than [...] due to wind, cold weather, and lightning strikes.|$|R

50|$|The {{state of}} Florida {{is home to}} a relict {{population}} of northern caracaras that dates to the last glacial period, which ended around 12,500 BP. At that point in time, Florida {{and the rest of the}} Gulf Coast was covered in an oak savanna. As temperatures increased, the savanna between Florida and Texas disappeared. Caracaras were able to survive in the prairies of central Florida as well as in the marshes along the St. Johns River. Cabbage palmettos are a preferred nesting site, although they will also nest in <b>southern</b> <b>live</b> <b>oaks.</b> Their historical range on the modern-day Florida peninsula included Okeechobee, Osceola, Highlands, Glades, Polk, Indian River, St. Lucie, Hardee, DeSoto, Brevard, Collier, and Martin counties. They are currently most common in DeSoto, Glades, Hendry, Highlands, Okeechobee and Osceola counties. Loss of adequate habitat caused the Florida caracara population to decline, and it was listed as threatened by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1987.|$|R
5000|$|Louise was {{the eldest}} child of wealthy French-Canadian Naval Officer Pierre Denys de La Ronde (1726-1772), re-assigned from Nouvelle-France to Nouvelle-Orleans by his Godfather, later French Louisiana Governor, Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial, and later {{distinguished}} in the French and Indian Wars.

Louise's mother, Madeleine (Broutin) Denys de la Ronde, {{was the daughter}} of Ignace Francois Broutin, royal engineer, celebrated architect, and commandant of the French militia at Fort Natchez. Her only brother was wealthy plantation owner Pierre Denis de La Ronde (1762 - 1824), who would distinguish himself in the Battle of New Orleans, the Night Attack of which was then fought on his much-admired, if widely misnamed (Versailles, Louisiana), plantation, and beneath its equally misnamed allée of <b>Southern</b> <b>live</b> <b>oaks.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Live</b> <b>oak</b> can {{be found}} in the wild growing and {{reproducing}} on the lower coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic United States. Its native range begins on the extreme southeastern coast of Virginia, south in a narrow band along the ocean to the middle of the South Carolina coast, where its range begins to expand farther inland. The range of <b>live</b> <b>oak</b> continues to expand inland as it moves south, growing across southern Georgia and covering all of Florida south to the northernmost Florida Keys. <b>Live</b> <b>oak</b> grows along the Florida panhandle to Mobile Bay, then westward across the southernmost two tiers of counties in Mississippi. <b>Live</b> <b>oak</b> grows across the southern third of Louisiana, except for some barrier islands and scattered parts of the most <b>southern</b> parishes. <b>Live</b> <b>oak’s</b> range continues into Texas and narrows to hug the coast until just past Port Lavaca, Texas. The species reaches its northwestern limit in the granite massifs and canyons in Southwestern Oklahoma, a rare remnant from the last glaciation.|$|R
25|$|Many foreign {{species are}} {{cultivated}} in the state, some as ornamentals, others as novelty species. Included {{among these are}} the crape myrtle, Italian cypress, <b>southern</b> magnolia, <b>live</b> <b>oak</b> in the warmer parts of the state, and even hardy palm trees in the warmer central and eastern parts of the state. USDA plant hardiness zones in the state range from Zones 5 and 6 in the extreme {{western part of the}} state to Zone 7 in the central part, and Zone 8 around {{the southern part of the}} coast, the bay area, and parts of metropolitan Baltimore. Invasive plant species, such as kudzu, tree of heaven, multiflora rose, and Japanese stiltgrass, stifle growth of endemic plant life. Maryland's state flower, the black-eyed susan, grows in abundance in wild flower groups throughout the state. The state insect, the Baltimore checkerspot butterfly, is not common as it is near the southern edge of its range. 435 species of birds have been reported from Maryland.|$|R
