This problem is known to be decidable with an algorithm based on detecting strongly connected components on the region graph, which, for complexity reasons, is not effective in practice. Our symbolic algorithm is based on the standard algorithm for symbolic reachability analysis using zones to represent symbolic states and can then be easily integrated within tools for the verification of timed automata models.

40|$|Abstract. The {{stability}} {{model was}} established and the two-dimensional and three-dimensional lobes were plotted for the milling of lateral walls {{in order to}} avoid chatter occurring in the milling of lateral walls. The combination of milling parameters of free chatter can be selected in the <b>stable</b> <b>zone</b> of stability lobes. The stability of milling lateral walls influenced by radial depth of cut and teeth number of the milling cutter was analyzed. It is shown that the <b>stable</b> <b>zone</b> of stability lobes expands gradually as the spindle speed increases. The <b>stable</b> <b>zone</b> become wider as the radial depth of cut increases. The axial depth of cut limits is increased and higher productivity can be obtained as the teeth of the milling cutter decreases.

Thin-walled parts are made of lateral walls and webs shown in figure 1.

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} theory to reveal {{for the first}} time the {{distinct}} mechanisms by which a compressed rod confined in a channel buckles in the presence of dry friction. Contrary to the case of a frictionless contact, with friction the system can bear substantially enhanced compressive load without buckling after its stiffness turns negative, and the onset of instability is strongly affected by the amount of perturbation set by the environment. Our theory, confirmed by simulations, shows that friction enhances stability by opening a wide <b>stable</b> <b>zone</b> in the perturbation space. Buckling is initiated when the applied compressive force is such that the boundary of the <b>stable</b> <b>zone</b> touches a point set by the environment, at a much higher critical load. Furthermore, our analysis shows that friction has a strong effect on the buckling mode; an increase in friction is found to lead to higher buckling modes...|$|R

Here we map the stability of the orbital space between planets f and d using a suite of n-body integrations that include an additional, yet-to-be-discovered planet g with a radial velocity amplitude of 5 m s − 1 (planet mass = 0. 5 - 1. 2 Saturn masses).

For each system we quantify the probability of detecting planets b − f on their current orbits given perturbations from hypothetical planet g, in order to further constrain the mass and orbit of an additional planet. We find that large perturbations are associated with specific mean motion resonances (MMRs) with planets f and d. We show that two MMRs, 3 f: 1 g (the 1 : 3 MMR between planets g and f) and 4 g: 1 d cannot contain a planet g. The 2 f: 1 g MMR is unlikely to contain a planet more massive than ∼ 20 M⊕. The 3 g: 1 d and 5 g: 2 d MMRs could contain a resonant planet but the resonant location is strongly confined. The 3 f: 2 g, 2 g: 1 d and 3 g: 2 d MMRs exert a stabilizing influence and could contain a resonant planet.

A single model equation for the local turbulence intensity, I (x, t), includes the effects of local linear growth and damping, spatially local nonlinear coupling to dissipation and spatial scattering of turbulence energy induced by nonlinear coupling. In the absence of dissipation, front propagation into the linearly <b>stable</b> <b>zone</b> occurs with the property of rapid progression at small t, followed by slower sub-diffusive progression at late times. The turbulence radial spreading into the linearly <b>stable</b> <b>zone</b> reduces the turbulent intensity in the linearly unstable zone and introduces an additional dependence on the ρ ∗ ≡ ρi/a to the turbulent intensity and the transport scaling.

Using the recently determined accurate initial condition by Konacki & Wolszczan (2003) who derived the orbital inclinations and the absolute masses of the planets, we investigate the system stability by long-term, 1 Gyr direct integrations. No secular changes of the semi-major axes, eccentricities and inclinations appear during such an interval. This stable behavior is confirmed with the fast indicator MEGNO. Another feature confirming the long term stability is a negligible exchange of the Angular Momentum Deficit between the innermost planet A and the pair of the outer planets B and C. An important factor for maintaining the stability is also {{the presence of the}} secular apsidal resonance (SAR) between the planets B and C with the center of libration about 180 deg.
