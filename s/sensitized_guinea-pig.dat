40|$|Histamine {{release and}} mast cell degranulation were induced in unsensitized perfused {{guinea-pig}} lung by the injection of soluble immune complexes containing rabbit antibody.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the effects of {{selective}} phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3, 4 and 5 inhibitors on antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pigs.</b> When the <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pigs</b> were orally pre-treated with the selective PDE 4 inhibitor, Ro 20 - 1724 (30 mg/kg), and studied 48 h after OA, a significant reduction (p< 0. 01) of the leftward shift of the dose-response curve to ACh was noted, whereas it was ineffective at the lower dose (10 mg/kg). Administration of the selective PDE 3 inhibitor, milrinone (30 mg/kg) also elicited a significant reduction (p< 0. 01) of the airway hyperresponsiveness, whereas the PDE 5 inhibitor zaprinast (30 mg/kg) was ineffective. These results show that both PDE 3 and PDE 4 inhibitors are able to inhibit the antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pigs</b> and support the potential utility of selective PDE inhibitors in the treatment of asthma...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} burimamide, an H 2 -antihistamine, on the anaphylactic {{reaction}} in the skin of ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs were studied in vitro. Burimamide enhanced the concentration of histamine in the supernatant fraction of antigen-challenged <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pig</b> skin in a dose-related way, but did not alter the concentration of residual histamine in the skin after antigen challenge. The enhanced histamine concentration in the supernatant was not due to increased histamine synthesis by the target cells during the reaction because the increase was not inhibited by a histidine decarboxylase inhibitor, Brocresine. In further experiments it was shown that guinea-pig skin possesses potent histamine degrading enzyme activity which is inhibited by burimamide.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a number of drugs on the {{production}} of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) by antigen-stimulated <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pig</b> lymph node cells was studied. The drugs were present during the entire culture period and eliminated from supernatants by dialysis. It was found that MIF secretion is inhibited by exogenous dibutyryl cyclic AMP and by theophylline and chlorphenesin, two agents raising the endogenous level of cyclic AMP. On the other hand, isoproterenol, which stimulates cyclic AMP generation in several tissues, did not block MIF production. The formation of the mediator was also suppressed by the microfilament-affecting drug, cytochalasin B. The microtubular disruptive agents, colchicine and vinblastine sulphate, did not influence MIF production. It is concluded that: (a) endogenous cyclic AMP may act as a regulator of MIF production; (b) the activity of contractile microfilaments is probably required for MIF formation; and (c) microtubules are not involved in the secretory process...|$|E

40|$|Background Endogenous {{adenosine}} {{levels are}} {{raised in the}} lungs during asthma attacks. 5 ′-adenosine monophosphate (5 ′-AMP) inhalation in asthmatics causes bronchoconstriction and in <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pigs</b> induces early (EAR) and late asthmatic responses (LAR), airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) and inflammatory cell recruitment to the lungs. Objective The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the roles of A 1, A 2 A, A 2 B and A 3 adenosine receptors in these responses to inhaled 5 ′-AMP in <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pigs.</b> Comparisons were made with the effect of dexamethasone treatment on 5 ′-AMP-induced responses. Methods Functional airways responses to inhaled 5 ′-AMP (3 and 300 mm) of actively <b>sensitized,</b> conscious <b>guinea-pigs</b> were determined by whole-body plethysmography following administration of selective adenosine receptor antagonists or their vehicles. AHR to inhaled histamine (1 mm) and inflammatory cell influx in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were determined. Results 5 ′-AMP at 3 mm caused an immediate bronchoconstriction (EAR), whereas 300 mm caused bronchodilatation. Both responses were followed at 6 h by a LAR, together with inflammatory cell influx and AHR to histamine. The A 2 A receptor antagonist, ZM 241385, further enhanced cell influx after 5 ′-AMP inhalation (3 and 300 mm), and blocked the immediate bronchodilator response to 300 mm 5 ′-AMP, exposing an EAR. The A 2 B receptor antagonist, MRS 1706 (in the presence of ZM 241385), inhibited the LAR, AHR and cell influx, following inhalation of 5 ′-AMP (300 mm). The A 3 receptor antagonist, MRS 1220, inhibited 5 ′-AMP-induced inflammatory cell influx. The A 1 receptor antagonist, DPCPX (in the presence of ZM 241385), inhibited the EAR following 5 ′-AMP inhalation (300 mm). Dexamethasone inhibited the LAR, AHR and cell influx following inhalation of 5 ′-AMP (300 mm).

40|$|Prostaglandins of the E and F series {{have been}} shown to relax or {{contract}} respectively guinea-pig trachea and recently it has been demonstrated that the prostaglandin endo-peroxides PGG 2 and PGH 2 (immediate precursors of prostaglandins E and F) have far greater potency in contracting tracheal smooth muscle than prostaglandin F (Hamberg, Svensson, Hedqvist, Strandberg & Samuelsson, 1976). Furthermore, both thromboxane A 2 and prostacyclin can also elicit contraction of the trachea with thromboxane A 2 being considerably more active (Omini, Moncada & Vane, 1977; Svensson, Strandberg, Tuvemo & Hamberg, 1977). Administration of thromboxane A 2 has been shown to raise the tracheal insufflation pressure in guinea-pigs (Svensson et al. 1977) and indeed its stable metabolite thromboxane B 2 is released in relatively large amounts from <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pig</b> lungs when challenged with antigen (Dawson, Boot, Cockerill, Mallen & Osborne, 1976; Hamberg et al. 1976).

40|$|Challenge of {{actively}} <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pig</b> trachea {{in vitro}} {{led to a}} contraction which was enhanced by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, indomethacin and sodium meclofenamate. Cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors eliminated the release of PGE-like material induced by arachidonic acid (AA), histamine, and antigen challenge. AA (10 microgram. /ml.) and PGE 2 (100 ng. /ml.) usually relaxed the trachea, whereas {{in the presence of}} cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors a contraction occurred. Phenidone and ETYA, which also blocked the lipoxygenase pathway of AA metabolism inhibited the enhancement of allergic tracheal contraction induced by cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, decreased the time that the trachea remained contracted, and also eliminated the contraction induced by AA and PGE 2. Thus, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors may enhance allergic tracheal contraction by diverting AA metabolism into the lipoxygenase pathway and product of the latter pathway, possibly SRS-A, may be responsible for the enhancement and for the prolonged phase of allergic tracheal contraction. An analogous mechanism may account for aspirin-induced asthma in man...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} parallel bioassay to the measurement of lymphocyte mitogenic, inflammatory and macrophage migration inhibitory activities present in guinea-pig lymphokine preparations.

40|$|Ovalbumin (OA) and {{arachidonic acid}} (AA) {{were used to}} induce contractions of <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pig</b> {{tracheal}} and lung preparations in the presence and absence of indomethacin. Leukotriene (LT) C 4 -like material released from these tissues was extracted from the bathing fluid and measured by radioimmunoassay. Challenge with either OA or AA induced release of LTC 4 -like material from both parenchyma and trachea, AA inducing a greater release than OA although OA induced greater contractions. This suggested that OA-induced the synthesis of other bronchoconstrictor compounds than LTC 4. Although indomethacin enhanced OA- and AA-induced contractions of trachea, there was no enhancement of the release of LTC 4 -like material, suggesting enhancement by indomethacin {{was a result of}} the inhibition of the synthesis of prostaglandin E 2 and not diversion of AA into the lipoxygenase pathway. Indomethacin had no effect on OA-induced contractions of parenchyma, but attenuated those induced by AA.

The liver slice of the guinea-pig sensitized with the horse serum (0. 25 cc) was suspended in Tyrode solution, and then the horse serum was poured into this suspension, thus producing anaphylactic shock. The following antihistamine drugs were used; benadrine (aminoether derivative), pyribenzamine (ethylene-diamine derivative) and anergen (pheno-thiazine derivative). The results are summarized as follows: 1) The rise of potential of the <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pig</b> liver by pouring the horse serum was inhibited by addition of antihistamine drugs. 2) In the inhibition of the rise of potential, benadrine of 3. 3 × 10 (- 3) - 3. 3 × 10 (- 5) mg / cc was more effective than 3. 3 (×) 10 (- 6) - 3. 3 × 10 (- 7) mg / cc. 3) For the inhibition of the rise of potential in anaphylactic shock, addition of benabrine 30 to 45 minutes before pouring the serum was more effective than 10 to 20 mintes before pouring. 4) For the inhibition of the rise of potentiol in anaphylactic shock, benadrine and pyribenzamine showed nearly the same effect, but anergen seemed to be somewhat less effective than the other two ones...|$|E

At the same time, histamine was also released, reaching a maximum at 5 min (290 +/- 63 pmol/g tissue) as determined by radioenzymatic assay. Similarly, the non-sensitized guinea-pig heart stimulated with the ionophore A 23187 (4 microM) released LTB 4, LTC 4, LTD 4 and LTE 4, as well as the 5 -hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (5 -HETE), 12 -HETE, and 15 -HETE as determined by RP-HPLC.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} in guinea-pigs suggest that heat treatment applied during {{the manufacture of}} baby milk formulae reduces the immunological sensitising capacity of the cow's milk proteins. This immunological benefit must be weighed against possible damage that heat treatment may cause to the nutritional quality of the products. Severe heat treatment of skimmed milk (121 degrees C for 20 min) destroyed all the vitamin B 12, about 60 % of the thiamin and vitamin B 6, 70 % of the ascorbic acid, and about 30 % of the folate. Available lysine was reduced by 21 % and lactulose was formed (166 mg/ 100 ml). Despite extensive denaturation of the whey proteins the milk retained its capacity to <b>sensitize</b> <b>guinea-pigs</b> for systemic anaphylaxis when administered orally.

40|$|The {{release of}} slow {{reacting}} substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) from <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pig</b> lung challenged with antigen {{was followed by}} a fall in the activity of this mediator in the diffusate when the incubations were continued for 3 h. The inactivating principle was also present in normal lung in addition to other normal guinea-pig tissues such as the liver, kidney, spleen, ileum and skin. No acitivity was found in muscle. Evidence is provided that some of this SRS-A-inactivating activity was due to tissue arylsulphatases. These were measured by hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl sulphate (p-NPS) and p-nitrocatechol sulphate (p-NCS), which reflect activities of arylsulphatase II A and II B respectively. Hydrolytic activity for p-NCS was present in all tissues with SRS-A-inactivating properties, whereas only lung, liver and skin tissue hydrolysed p-NCS and p-NPS. Following passage of a cell-free lung homogenate through a column of Sephadex G- 200 the p-NCS hydrolysing and SRS-Z-inactivating activities eluted together, with molecules having a molecular size of approximately 150, 000 Daltons, p-NPS hydrolysing activity being destroyed during the preparation of the homogenate. The release of arylsulphatase from sensitized tissue was not dependent on the presence of specific antigen.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{phosphodiesterase}} (PDE) inhibition and forskolin pretreatment on the contractile responses of guinea-pig urinary bladder strips to electrical field stimulation, carbachol, ATP and KCl were studied. Inhibition of cyclic AMP-specific PDE 4 isozymes by rolipram significantly reduced the contractile response of bladder strips to field stimulation. Rolipram also suppressed the contractile response to low concentrations of carbachol, but potentiated {{the response to}} high concentrations. The contractile response to ATP was significantly reduced by rolipram treatment, but that to KCl was unaltered. Inhibition of cyclic GMP-specific PDE 5 isozymes by zaprinast had no effects on the contractile response of bladder strips to field stimulation, ATP or KCl. Zaprinast suppressed the contractile responses to 1 [*]μM carbachol and potentiated the response to high concentrations. Contractile responses to field stimulation and to carbachol after pretreatment with the adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, were qualitatively similar to those caused by rolipram treatment. β-Adrenoceptor blockade with propranolol partially reversed the inhibitory effects of rolipram on the response to field stimulation. Rolipram significantly reduced the contractile response of bladder strips from sensitized guinea-pigs to ovalbumin challenge, but zaprinast was ineffective.

It contains daidzein and hesperetin, selective inhibitors of family 3 (PDE 3) and 4 (PDE 4) of phosphodiesterases (PDEs), respectively. In passively sensitized human airways, allergen-induced contraction {{was reported to be}} inhibited only by the simultaneous inhibition of PDE 3 and PDE 4, but not by single inhibition of either isozyme. Therefore, we are interested in investigating the interaction between daidzein and hesperetin on their antispasmodic effects in the isolated sensitized and non-sensitized guinea-pig tracheas, to clarify the difference between these two tissues, because effects of TCM prescription on patients with or without allergic asthma are often different. Guinea-pigs were sensitized by subcutaneous injection of ovalbumin (OVA) into legs. After sensitization, the baseline and cumulative OVA-induced contractions of the sensitized trachea were isometrically recorded on a polygraph. In the same way, the histamine (30 μM) -induced tonic contraction of non-sensitized guinea-pig trachea was recorded. The isobole method was used to analyse the antagonism and synergism between daidzein and hesperetin. The isoboles showed antagonism between daidzein and hesperetin on baseline relaxant effect and OVA (100 μg/ml) -induced contraction in the <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pig</b> trachea. In contrast, the isobole showed synergism between daidzein and hesperetin on the relaxant effect of histamine-induced tonic contraction in non-sensitized guinea-pig trachea.

Comparisons were made with the effects of inhaled antigen. Methods Airway responses of conscious <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pigs</b> to inhalation exposures of 5 ′-AMP were determined by whole body plethysmography as the change in specific airway conductance (sGaw). Influx of leucocytes into the airways was determined by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Results 5 ′-AMP caused bronchoconstrictor airway responses in sensitized animals. Dose-dependent infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lungs occurred 1 h after 5 ′-AMP exposure. No bronchoconstriction or cell influx was seen in unsensitized guinea-pigs. Exposure to ovalbumin (OA) also caused influx of inflammatory cells. Twenty-four hours after an OA exposure, 5 ′-AMP produced no bronchoconstriction. The P 1 -receptor antagonists, 8 -PT and 8 -SPT, inhibited the 5 ′-AMP-induced bronchoconstriction, indicating that the bronchoconstriction seen in sensitized animals is mediated by A 1 or A 2 receptors. They had no effect on the cell influx, whereas the A 3 antagonist, MRS- 1220, significantly inhibited cellular infiltration, suggesting mediation through A 3 receptors. At 24 h after an OA challenge and accompanying the cellular influx, there was airway hyper-responsiveness to the bronchoconstriction by histamine. In contrast, no hyper-responsiveness to histamine was seen 1 h after 3 mm or 24 h after 300 mm 5 ′-AMP. Conclusions 5 ′-AMP caused a rapid migration of eosinophils and macrophages into the airways only in <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pigs,</b> and this was blocked by the A 3 antagonist MRS- 1220.

40|$|Ovalbumin (OA) {{and calcium}} {{ionophore}} A 23187 {{were used to}} induce contractions of <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pig</b> tracheal and lung parenchymal preparations in the presence and absence of indomethacin. This model {{was used to examine}} the properties of a series of compounds reported to inhibit 5 -lipoxygenase or to antagonize lipoxygenase products at the receptor level. FPL 55712 and piriprost appeared to act as pharmacological antagonists because they rapidly reduced tracheal tone established by OA. The prolonged phase (i. e. greater than 10 min post-challenge) of airways contractions induced by OA is assumed to be lipoxygenase-dependent and was inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), FPL 55712, nafazatrom and benoxaprofen, in order of potency. Piriprost had similar inhibitory effects on the trachea, but not on lung parenchyma. The inhibitory effects of NDGA and FPL 55712 were reduced, and those of nafazatrom increased by indomethacin. Indomethacin decreased the inhibitory effect of piriprost on the trachea, but facilitated inhibition by this agent on the parenchyma. A roughly similar pattern was seen on A 23187 -induced contractions, but FPL 55712 did not modify these contractions and benoxaprofen enhanced the response of the trachea. BW 755 C enhanced the overall contractile response of OA- and A 23187 -induced tracheal contractions (but not parenchymal contractions) in a bell-shaped manner, an effect not seen in the presence of indomethacin. This indicated that BW 755 C could be acting as a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor. The results suggested that, although inhibitors of the lipoxygenase pathway were partially effective in inhibiting the contractions of the airways induced by OA or A 23187, other mediators in addition to those of the lipoxygenase pathway contribute to these contractions.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect exerted by hr-interleukin- 1 α (IL- 1 α) on {{responsiveness}} of alveolar macrophages (AM) from naive and sensitized guinea-pigs, through O 2 ‐˙ production (by ferricytochrome C reduction), platelet-activating factor (PAF) release (by platelet aggregation), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) release (by a radioimmunoassay), and cytosolic phospholipase A 2 (cPLA 2) activity (by hydrolysis of radioactive substrate). In naive guinea-pig AM, 0. 06 [*]nM hr-IL- 1 α pretreatment decreased by 65 % O 2 ‐˙ release stimulated with 10 [*]nM fMLP. In contrast, O 2 ‐˙ production was not affected in <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pig</b> AM. O 2 ‐˙ release elicited by fMLP stimulation in both cell groups {{was affected by}} PLA 2 inhibitors (10 [*]μM bromophenacyl bromide, BPB or 10 [*]μM methylprednisolone, MP). In contrast, 10 [*]μM arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF 3), a cPLA 2 inhibitor, was ineffective. In naive AM, PAF release was elicited by hr-IL- 1 α pretreatment and by separate fMLP-stimulation, but when the stimulus was added to hr-IL- 1 α-pretreated cells inhibition of PAF release was observed. In sensitized AM, PAF release was lower than that found in naive guinea-pig AM in both hr-IL- 1 α-pretreated and fMLP-stimulated cells. PGE 2 release was unaffected by hr-IL- 1 α pretreatment and it was decreased by fMLP in both naive and sensitized AMs. The latter released less PGE 2 than naive cells in basal conditions and after fMLP treatment. Sensitized AM showed a greater cPLA 2 activity in all experimental conditions in comparison to naive cells. cPLA 2 activity assayed in the cytosolic fraction {{was found to be}} enhanced by hr-IL- 1 α pretreatment and by fMLP stimulation in naive but not in sensitized AM. However, when the stimulus was added to hr-IL- 1 α-pretreated cells we observed a decrease in cPLA 2 activity in the cytosol and an increase in the membranes, thus suggesting a translocation of enzymatic activity. In conclusion, hr-IL- 1 α can modulate the responsiveness of AM from naive and sensitized guinea-pigs, as suggested by changes found in the release of PAF and O 2 ‐˙. and in cPLA 2 activity; therefore, sensitization itself may affect cellular responsiveness...|$|E
40|$|Cyclophosphamide (CY) {{treatment}} {{known to}} enhance the normal cell-mediated immune response by selectively inhibiting the function of suppressor cells abrogates tolerance by pretreatment when tolerant animals are sensitized 3 days after the intraperitoneal injection of CY. The tolerance during the primary response is also reversed by CY treatment, indicating that in both these types of unresponsiveness suppressor cells may be operating. However, CY treatment did not influence the short-lasting unresponsiveness induced in already <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pigs</b> by the intravenous injection of tolerogen. These findings corroborate {{the idea that the}} mechanism of desensitization is different from that of tolerance induced by pretreatment of during the primary response...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Responses to KCI and {{histamine}} and 45 Ca {{movements were}} studied in trachea from normal and actively <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pigs.</b> <b>Sensitized</b> tracheas were hyperresponsive and hypersensitive to KCI and histamine. 45 Ca uptake experiments show that sensitized tracheal muscle behaves as normal {{except that the}} uptake of 45 Ca in low concentration (0. 03 mM) Ca 2 • solution was higher {{and the number of}} binding sites for the high affinity component of 45 Ca uptake (as estimated by Scatchard-coordinate plot) was augmented. Additionally, in sensitized tracheal muscle, incubation in low (0. 03 mM) Ca 1 • solution followed by La 3 • wash-out resulted in a greater amount of residual 45 Ca than in normal tissues. KCI, but not histamine, increased the La 3 • resistant 45 Ca content. This increase was greater in sensitized than in nonnal trachea. This demonstrates the existence of hyperreactivity and altered 45 Ca movements in sensitized trachealis muscle. • Service of Pneumology and • • • Research Center...|$|R

Intradermal injection of ribosomes from skin test dose N. gonorrhoeae into the skin of animals sensitized to the homologous organism was characterized by a specificity based upon ribosomal skin test dose 50 's (STD 50) sensitivity which was at least five-fold {{greater than that of}} the animals sensitized to the heterologous organism. The <b>sensitized</b> <b>guinea-pigs</b> had lost their skin-test reactivity within 3 months of the cessation of immunization but regained it immediately on reimmunization.
