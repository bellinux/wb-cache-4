40|$|Abstract. The Joint Research Centre {{recently}} {{obtained a}} license to operate a new experimental device intended for {{research in the field}} of nuclear safeguards. One of the research projects currently being planned for the new device concerns the mass determination of small amounts of fissile materials by means of the active neutron correlation technique. The device incorporates a commercial pulsed neutron generator and a large graphite mantle surrounding the <b>sample</b> <b>cavity.</b> In this configuration a relatively high thermal neutron flux with a long lifetime is achieved inside the <b>sample</b> <b>cavity.</b> By pulsing the neutron generator, a sample may be interrogated by a pure thermal neutron flux during repeated time periods. The neutrons emitted from the fission events in the sample are partly detected in time intervals in a fashion similar to the standard passive neutron correlation technique (multiplicity counting). The frequency distributions of detected neutrons, or rather the moments hereof, can be expressed as function of the fissile mass, and sample and instrument parameters in analytical equations. The present paper describes the new experimental device, the data acquisition systems and the analysis method currently being investigated for the assay of small fissile quantitiesJRC.

40|$|In {{a prompt}} gamma ray neutron {{activation}} analysis (PGNAA) setup, the neutron moderation in the bulk sample also plays a key role. This can even dominate the thermalization effects of the external moderator in some cases. In order to study the neutron moderation effect in the bulk sample, moderators with two different sizes of the sample were tested at the King Fahd University of Petroleum Minerals (KFUPM) PGNAA facility. In these tests, the thermal neutron relative intensity and prompt gamma ray yield from the two moderators were measured using nuclear track detectors (NTDs) and NaI detector, respectively. As predicted by Monte Carlo simulations, the measured intensity of thermal neutron inside the large <b>sample</b> <b>cavity</b> due to the external moderator was smaller than that from the smaller <b>sample</b> <b>cavity.</b> Due to its larger size, additional thermalization of neutrons {{will take place in}} the larger sample. In spite of smaller thermal neutron yield from the external moderator at the large sample location, higher yield of the prompt gamma ray was observed as compared to that from the smaller sample. This confirms the significance of neutron moderation effects in the bulk sample and can thereby affect the PGNAA geometr...|$|R

The facility, called the Pulsed Neutron Interrogation Test Assembly (PUNITA), incorporates a pulsed 14 -MeV D-T neutron generator and a large graphite mantle surrounding a <b>sample</b> <b>cavity.</b> The sealed generator emits neutrons in 10 -microsecond pulses. After a slowing-down time of approximately 300 microseconds, an average thermal neutron lifetime of approximately one millisecond is achieved in the graphite moderator and the <b>sample</b> <b>cavity.</b> By pulsing the neutron generator with a frequency between 10 to 150 Hz, a sample may be interrogated first by fast neutrons, and a few hundred microseconds later by a pure thermal neutron flux.

By investigating the influence of various factors on plasma temperature, one can gain knowledge about the processes in plasma and adjust experimental conditions to obtain optimum analytical performance. Herein the fundamental theories and calculation methods of LIP temperature via spectroscopic approaches are briefly reviewed. Its temporal and spatial evolutions together with several influencing factors are discussed, such as laser parameters, ambient surrounding, and physical & chemical properties of the sample. The results summarized exhibit the general trend that LIP temperature increases with increasing laser wavelength, pulse width, laser energy, background gas pressure, and sample hardness. On the other hand, it decreases with time elapsing and distance from sample surface. Moreover, plasma temperature generated in argon surrounding is higher than that in other gas species, and the rank of temperature values generated from different samples exhibits a general tendency of Cu > Fe > Ni ≈ Al ≈ glass ≈ rock. Additionally, LIP temperature tends to increase as lens focal point approaches sample surface, and the plasma confinement effect in <b>sample</b> <b>cavity</b> is significant in altering plasma temperature.

This paper describes the first prototype UV nitrate sensor designed to evaluate and compare options for the light source, spectral filter and detector.

These relationships are called the higher order polarizabilities and are distinctly different from the idea of hyperpolarizabilities. These higher order polarizabilities interact with the field gradients, whereas the hyperpolarizabilities interact only with the field. Next we examine the contribution of these higher order polarizabilities, as well as the permanent moments, to the potential energy of the molecule in a nonuniform field. ^ We investigate some specific cases for methane, in which symmetry considerations allow for simplifications in the equations for the potential energy and the induced moments. We also calculate the contribution of the permanent octupole moment versus one of the higher order polarizability terms for methane in a <b>sample</b> <b>cavity.</b> We find that, to a large extent, these two molecular properties determine the potential energy behavior of methane in a nonuniform field, where the relative importance of each property depends upon the field and the field gradients involved. ^ The static moments and the higher order polarizabilities are determined from SCF calculations using the finite field method. Potential energy calculations show excellent agreement between results produced by our model and those produced by the SCF method. The advantage of our model is that it includes the rotational dependence of the potential energy and the induced moment in an analytical function.

The measured surhce resistance was reasonable and repeatable during either cooling or warming. Materials tested included four grades of Beryllium, OFE copper, alumina-dispersion strengthened copper (Glidcop), and Cu-plated versions of all of the above. Two coupons, Cuplated on Beryllium 0 - 30 and 1 - 70, offered comparable surface resistance to pure OFE copper or Cu-plated Glidcop. The RF surface resistance of Cu-on-Beryllium samples at cryogenic temperatures is reported together with that of other reference materials...|$|R
