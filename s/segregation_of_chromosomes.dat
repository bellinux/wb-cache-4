PP2A is recruited to cohesin by Shugoshin 2 (Sgo2; SGOL2 in yeast).

50|$|Proper {{cohesion}} {{of sister}} chromatids {{is a prerequisite}} for the correct <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> during cell division. The cohesin multiprotein complex is required for sister chromatid cohesion. This complex is composed partly of two structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins, SMC3 and either SMC1L2 or the protein encoded by this gene. Most of the cohesin complexes dissociate from the chromosomes before mitosis, although those complexes at the kinetochore remain. Therefore, the encoded protein is thought to be an important part of functional kinetochores. In addition, this protein interacts with BRCA1 and is phosphorylated by ATM, indicating a potential role for this protein in DNA repair. This gene, which belongs to the SMC gene family, is located in an area of the X-chromosome that escapes X inactivation.|$|E

40|$|SummaryDNA damage {{checkpoint}} prevents <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> damaged <b>chromosomes</b> {{by imposing}} cell-cycle arrest. In budding yeast, Mec 1, Chk 1, and Rad 53 (homologous to human ATM/ATR, Chk 1, and Chk 2 kinases, respectively) {{are among the}} main effectors of this pathway. The DNA damage checkpoint is thought to inhibit chromosome segregation by preventing separase-mediated cleavage of cohesins. Here, we describe a regulatory network that prevents <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> damaged <b>chromosomes</b> by restricting spindle elongation and acts in parallel with inhibition of cohesin cleavage. This control circuit involves Rad 53, polo kinase, the anaphase-promoting complex activator Cdh 1, and the bimC kinesin family proteins Cin 8 and Kip 1. The inhibition of polo kinase by Rad 53 -dependent phosphorylation prevents it from inactivating Cdh 1. As a result, Cdh 1 remains in a partially active state and limits Cin 8 and Kip 1 accumulation, thereby restraining spindle elongation. Hence, the DNA damage checkpoint suppresses both cohesin cleavage and spindle elongation to preserve chromosome stability...|$|R
50|$|Micronucleus is {{the name}} given to the small nucleus that forms {{whenever}} a chromosome or a fragment of a chromosome is not incorporated {{into one of the}} daughter nuclei during cell division. It usually is a sign of genotoxic events and chromosomal instability. Micronuclei are commonly seen in cancerous cells and may indicate genomic damage events that can increase the risk of developmental or degenerative diseases. Micronuclei form during anaphase from lagging acentric chromosome or chromatid fragments caused by incorrectly repaired or unrepaired DNA breaks or by nondisjunction of chromosomes. This incorrect <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> may result from hypomethylation of repeat sequences present in pericentromeric DNA, irregularities in kinetochore proteins or their assembly, dysfunctional spindle apparatus, or flawed anaphase checkpoint genes. Many micronucleus assays have been developed to test for the presence of these structures and determine their frequency in cells exposed to certain chemicals or subjected to stressful conditions.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Crossing over occurs between {{prophase}} 1 and metaphase 1 and is {{the process}} where homologous chromosomes pair up {{with each other and}} exchange different segments of their genetic material to form recombinant chromosomes. It can also happen during mitotic division, which may result in loss of heterozygosity. Crossing over is essential for the normal <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> during meiosis. Crossing over also accounts for genetic variation, because due to the swapping of genetic material during crossing over, the chromatids held together by the centromere are no longer identical. So, when the chromosomes go on to meiosis II and separate, some of the daughter cells receive daughter chromosomes with recombined alleles. Due to this genetic recombination, the offspring have a different set of alleles and genes than their parents do. In the diagram, genes B and b are crossed over with each other, making the resulting recombinants after meiosis Ab, AB, ab, and aB.|$|E
5000|$|Meiotic {{chromosomal}} crossover (CO) recombination {{facilitates the}} proper segregation of homologous chromosomes. This is because, {{at the end}} of meiotic prophase I, CO recombination provides a physical link that holds homologous chromosome pairs together. These linkages are established by chiasmata, which are the cytological manifestations of CO recombination. Together with cohesion linkage between sister chromatids, CO recombination may help ensure the orderly segregation of the paired homologous chromosomes to opposite poles. In support of this, a study of aneuploidy in single spermatozoa by whole genome sequencing found that, on average, human sperm cells with aneuploid autosomes exhibit significantly fewer crossovers than normal cells. [...] After the first chromosome segregation in meiosis I is complete, there is further chromosome segregation during the second equational division of meiosis II. Both proper initial <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in prophase I and the next chromosome segregation during equational division in meiosis II are required to generate gametes with the correct number of chromosomes.|$|E

Thus, replication is independent of cell cycle and coupled to cell growth. Replication events occur in a spatially random fashion. However, once assembled, replisomes move in a constrained manner. On the other hand, we found that segregation displays a striking spatial organization in some cells. Chromosomes transiently align along the major axis of the cell and timing of alignment was correlated to cell division.

40|$|The {{causes and}} {{consequences}} <b>of</b> <b>chromosome</b> loss in bacteria with multiple chromosomes are unknown.

Here, we show that the chromosome II parAB 2 genes are essential for the <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosome</b> II but not chromosome I. In a parAB 2 deletion mutant, chromosome II is mislocalized and frequently fails to segregate, yielding cells with only chromosome I. These cells divide once; their progeny are not viable. Instead, chromosome II-deficient cells undergo dramatic cell enlargement, nucleoid condensation and degradation, and loss of membrane integrity. The highly consistent nature of these cytologic changes suggests that prokaryotes, like eukaryotes, may possess characteristic death pathways...|$|R
5000|$|Cdc14 is also {{involved}} in regulation of key steps during meiosis in budding yeast. Cdc55, a regulatory subunit of Protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A), sequesters Cdc14 in the nucleolus during early stage of meiosis. The sequestration of Cdc14 is necessary for assembling the meiosis I spindle. Although, the early stage sequestration of Cdc14 is not essential for separation of chromosomes. FEAR (Cdc Fourteen Early Anaphase Release) complex proteins, SLK19 and SPO12 regulate the release of Cdc14. [...] The release of Cdc14 from nucleolus results in cdk1 inactivation and ultimately in disassembly of spindle during Anaphase of meiosis I. Cells deprived of Cdc14 or SLK19 and SPO12 have abnormal meiosis. They have only one division during meiosis. The chromosomes also segregate abnormally. The abnormality arises due to delay in dissembling of spindle during Anaphase I. However, the <b>segregation</b> <b>of</b> <b>chromosomes</b> continue and both the phases of meiotic segregations take place on prolonged meiosis I spindle.
