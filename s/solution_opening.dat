40|$|AbstractTechnology scaling is {{increasingly}} yielding diminish-ing returns {{in terms of}} product performance, power, and its yield. Recent development in through-silicon via (TSV) technology has made multi-layer stacking (or 3 D integration) a viable <b>solution,</b> <b>opening</b> possibility for coping with the issues related to poor interconnect scaling trend. In this direction there have been research works looking separately at performance, power, and area (or cost) benets associated with the shift from 2 D to 3 D man-ufacturing process for SRAM. However, the poor scaling trend associated with devices still remains as a challenge in realizing large on-chip memories. Heterogeneous 3 D integration has been widely adopted for bringing analog, RF, MEMS, DRAM, SRAM, among other wide application on a single chip. In this work, we propose to use heterogeneous 3 D integration as an alternative means to manufacture SRAM with multiple technologies. This choice expands the design space that a SRAM designer has thus allowing graceful management of issues related to technology scaling. The main roadblock in realizing 3 D integration is the manufacturing cost associated with the TSV process and its yield. Additionally, increased thermal congestion between 3 D layers can potentially accelerate many of the reliability mechanisms (gate oxide degradation like Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI)) bringing down the SRAM lifetime yield. Hence to help the system designer understand the overall benet an integrated on-chip cache analysis ow is implemented to assess the shift from planar to 3 D SRAM design under one platform. Our study shows performance, power, cost, and lifetime yield benet in the move towards heterogeneous 3 D cache compared with 2 D caches and homogeneous 3 D caches. I...|$|E

Some {{of the highlights of}} this program are the identification of intercalation pseudocapacitance in Nb 2 O 5, which enables high energy density to be achieved at high rates, {{and the development of a}} new route for synthesizing mesoporous films in which preformed nanocrystal building blocks are used in combination with polymer templating. The resulting material architectures have large surface areas and enable electrolyte access to the redox active pore walls, while the interconnected mesoporous film provides good electronic conductivity. Select first-principles density-functional theory studies of prototypical pseudocapacitor materials are reviewed, providing insight into the key physical and chemical features involved in charge transfer and ion diffusion. Rigorous multiscale physical models and numerical tools have been developed and used to reproduce electrochemical properties of carbon-based electrochemical capacitors with the ultimate objective of facilitating the optimization of electrode design. For the organic photovoltaic (OPV) program, our focus has been ongoing beyond the trial-and-error Edisonian approaches that have been responsible for the increase in power conversion efficiency of blend-cast (BC) bulk heterojunction blends of polymers and fullerenes. Our first approach has been to use molecular self-assembly to create the ideal nanometer-scale architecture using thermodynamics rather than relying on the kinetics of spontaneous phase segregation. We have created fullerenes that self-assemble into one-dimensional stacks and have shown that use of these self-assembled fullerenes lead to dramatically enhanced OPV performance relative to fullerenes that do not assemble. We also have created self-assembling conjugated polymers that form gels based on electrically continuous cross-linked micelles in <b>solution,</b> <b>opening</b> the possibility for water-processable "green" production of OPVs based on these materials. Our second approach has been to avoid kinetic control over phase separation by using a sequential processing (SqP) technique to deposit the polymer and fullerene materials in separate deposition steps. The polymer layer is deposited first, using solvents and deposition conditions that optimize the polymer crystallinity for swelling and hole mobility. The fullerene layer is then deposited in a second step from a solvent that swells the polymer but does not dissolve it, allowing the fullerene to penetrate into the polymer underlayer to the desired degree. Careful comparison of composition- and thickness-matched BC and SqP devices shows that SqP not only produces more efficient devices but also leads to devices that behave more consistently. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|El-Marj Plain is {{a closed}} {{depression}} {{on the upper}} terrace of the Jebel Akhdar of Cyrenaica. It is the largest karstic basin {{in the whole of}} Cyrenaica. The Plain has a subvalley shape with a total area of about 1, 100 sq. km. Most of the Arable land is located between 278 and 300 m. above sea-level. The escarpments to {{the north and the south}} of the Plain are dissected by numerous wadis making the extension of the road system an expensive task. The water flows in the wadis during the winter and either reaches the sea or disappears into the pervious limestones without being utilised by man. Geologically, the most extensive strata are the Middle Eocene. Rainfall is the main fundamental factor in El-Marj Plain since dry farming is practised there, and there are no means of irrigation except on the coastal plain. El-Marj Plain receives an annual rainfall average varying between 300 and 500 mm. However, the rainfall is erratic both in quantity and distribution. The rather high average of rainfall, topography and heavy Terra Rossa soils determine the vegetation cover in the region. The flora of the Plain is related more to the Maghreb and southern Europe than to the rest of Libya. Shortage of water and soil erosion are the main physical obstacles to. Economic development. The underground water in El-Marj Plain is contained chiefly in fractures, bedding planes and <b>solution</b> <b>opening</b> in the limestone country rock. The Terra Rossa soils in El-Marj Plain are quite deep and provide an adequate rooting medium for plants and the limitations found are not so much inherent as related to the system, of management. There is no pedalogical reason to suppose that under a good management system the soils of El-Marj Plain should not prove particularly fertile. The long history of the region shows that it was subjected to the invasions of the Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Turks and Italians. The invasion of Bani Sulaim tribally organised nomads in the eleventh century brought an end to a long period of sedentary life. After a long period of stagnation the Italians planned for a demographic colonisation, but this had come to an end in 1943 and the Bedouin again regained the control of the whole of Cyrenaica. El-Marj Plain’s principle natural resource is agriculture and rising livestock. The main crops are barley and wheat followed by olives, almonds and vines. Vegetables are grown in the area on only a small scale. Livestock production in the area probably accounts for a greater value than crop production in most years. After the discovery of oil and the rapid increase in production, capital has become available for economic development. Consequently, the Libyan Government has planned to settle the Bedouin who occupied the former Italian farms. The highly favourable terms offered by the N. A. S. A. scheme for re-settlement taken along with a powerful internal trend towards sedentary life appears to give grounds for optimism. The total population of El-Marj Plain and the adjacent administrative units is 39, 867 (l 964). The only urban centre in the region is El-Marj town, which was struck by an earthquake in 1963.

Abundant rainfall, a generally thin unsaturated zone, geologic media of inherently low permeability, and the operational practices employed have contributed to partial saturation of the buried waste, leaching of radionuclides, and transport of dissolved matter from the burial areas. Two primary methods of transport from these sites are by dissolution in circulating ground water, and the overflow of fluids in trenches and subsequent flow across land surface.

The typical problem, as in industrial or computer processing applications, has some restrictions that are inapplicable for certain cases.
