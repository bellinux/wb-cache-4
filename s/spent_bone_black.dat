50|$|The {{painting}} was {{investigated by the}} scientists of the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Heritage and FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics (AMOLF) Amsterdam. The ground is dense and yellowish in color and is composed of chalk, lead white, ocher and very little black. The dark background of the painting contains <b>bone</b> <b>black,</b> weld (luteolin, reseda luteola), chalk, small amounts of red ochre, and indigo. The face and draperies were painted mainly using ochres, natural ultramarine, <b>bone</b> <b>black,</b> charcoal black and lead white.|$|R

50|$|The {{painting}} was {{investigated by the}} scientists of the National Gallery London. Rembrandt employed his usual limited number of pigments, such as ochres, vermilion, red lakes, lead white, lead-tin-yellow and <b>bone</b> <b>black.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{scientific}} {{analysis of}} this painting by the scientists at the National Gallery in London revealed {{the use of the}} following pigments by Rembrandt: lead white, <b>bone</b> <b>black,</b> charcoal black, ochres and vermilion.|$|R
30|$|The pXRF {{of a black}} painted area {{showed the}} {{presence}} of calcium, iron and potassium. Figure  12 shows {{the front and back}} surfaces of a sample of black paint with the latter revealing a red-based layer that is reinforced by straw. Calcium is associated with the preparatory layer but the iron content could originate from the deposition of dust onto the surface. The SEM–EDS indicates a high concentration of carbon in the paint layer from which we infer that carbon black or soot black is the pigment. Other types of <b>black</b> pigment (e.g. <b>bone</b> <b>black,</b> ivory black, and manganese oxide) contain manganese and/or phosphorus which were not detected thereby ruling out the possible use of these pigments. In addition to the morphological examination of the cross-section preparation and SEM–EDS analysis, FTIR spectroscopy supported the conclusion drawn as spectra of <b>bone</b> <b>black,</b> ivory black and carbon black were compared with one obtained from the black sample.|$|R
25|$|In Vermeer’s oeuvre, {{only about}} 20 {{pigments}} have been detected. Of these 20 pigments, seven principal pigments which Vermeer commonly employed include lead white, yellow ochre, vermilion, madder lake, green earth, raw umber, and ivory or <b>bone</b> <b>black.</b>|$|R
30|$|The black pigment was {{identified}} as carbon black. Since the characteristic band of [PO 4] 3 − was not detected in Raman analyses and no phosphorus {{was found in the}} ESEM–EDX analysis, it is possible to exclude the animal origin of the pigment. Black pigments of vegetable origin have generally been made from various kinds of charred plant matter, mostly wood, but also leaves or seeds; the charcoal formed during the charring process is then washed, to remove soluble matter, and finally ground to powder [48]. The analysis of black pigments from the Ptolemaic baths in front of Karnak temples complex, revealed the detection of <b>bone</b> <b>black</b> [49]. <b>Bone</b> <b>black</b> {{is one of the oldest}} pigments known to humans, and was originally made by charring animal bones.|$|R
50|$|Ivory {{black was}} {{formerly}} made by grinding charred ivory in oil. Today ivory black {{is considered a}} synonym for <b>bone</b> <b>black.</b> Actual ivory is no longer used because of the expense and because animals who are natural sources of ivory are subject to international control as endangered species.|$|R

30|$|Concerning {{the dove}} {{from the current}} image, the Pb, Ca and P {{distribution}} maps suggest a prominent use of lead white and <b>bone</b> <b>black</b> for depicting the bird [18]. Punctual Raman analyses performed on the grey and black brushstrokes confirmed the combination of <b>bone</b> <b>black</b> and lead white. The detection of more intense Zn and Cr signals, associated to the former sky, in the dark grey and black shades of the dove {{can be explained by}} the fluorescence emission of both elements, which is less attenuated in the areas richer in <b>bone</b> <b>black</b> (Ca and P being lighter elements than the Pb, more abundant in the surrounding regions). In the same way, the Fe and Zn signals detected in the upper part of the left wing, partly covering the nude’s shoulder can be considered as coming from the flesh tones lying beneath. The shoe seems mainly made of iron-based pigment(s) admixed with variable proportions of lead white, the white pigment being more abundant in the lightest brown shades found in the buckle and inside the shoe. The use of earth pigments could explain the concomitant presence of Ca and Fe elements found out in the shoe and in the legs of the bird. One can see that the signature stands out in the Fe and Ca maps. The abundance and the even distribution of both elements are compliant with a writing based on earth pigments.|$|R

30|$|Similarly, {{when looking}} at the cobalt (Co) map, we can see that the wooden legs of the easel extend over the blue paint of the mountain. The {{contours}} of the depicted canvas, painted with a grey mixture of lead white and <b>bone</b> <b>black,</b> mask the cobalt (Co) and tin (Sn) emissions, showing that these were also painted on top of the mountain blue.|$|R
50|$|The {{second season}} began June 17, 1935, {{during which time}} {{excavations}} focused on the Central Tomb, revealing another burial. A 100- to 110-foot trench revealed Tomb 4, which contained fragments of human <b>bone.</b> <b>Black</b> wrote with regret {{that it had been}} damaged by the surrounding excavations. Soon after, they discovered Tomb 5, which also contained human burials, pieces of bark, and beads.|$|R
30|$|The calcium (Ca) {{distribution}} map indicates {{this element}} to be {{abundant in the}} black paint passages. Here the use of <b>bone</b> <b>black</b> appears in the painting of the fine details of the easel such as the fixings, the nails and the small shadows of the tripod. Calcium can also be detected on all the small tacks along the canvas edge, although here with a much fainter signal.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes the coats are {{in three}} {{different}} colors, such as brown for the first, red for the second, and white or grey for the final coat. The pigments used for this work include Indian red, Turkey red, Antwerp blue, German blue, umber, ochre, purple brown, <b>bone</b> <b>black</b> or oxide of manganese for black. Combinations of these colors are made to produce any desired tone.|$|R

25|$|One {{aspect of}} his meticulous {{painting}} technique was Vermeer's choice of pigments. He {{is best known for}} his frequent use of the very expensive ultramarine (The Milkmaid), and also lead-tin-yellow (A Lady Writing a Letter), madder lake (Christ in the House of Martha and Mary), and vermilion. He also painted with ochres, <b>bone</b> <b>black</b> and azurite. The claim that he utilized Indian yellow in Woman Holding a Balance has been disproven by later pigment analysis.|$|R
30|$|The μFTIR {{analyses}} were performed on the varnishes layers identified by UV fluorescence imaging and diterpenic and/or triterpenic resinous substances, were individuated. Proteinaceous components in the junctions glues of the fragments were identified by μFTIR analyses: this result {{could be related to}} the presence of a <b>bone</b> <b>black</b> pigment or hide glue. Finally the analysis on the tuning pegs highlighted different decoration techniques and helped to confirm the hypothesis about the presence of restoration parts.|$|R

50|$|Bone char is {{also used}} as a black pigment for artist's paint, printmaking, calligraphic and drawing inks {{as well as other}} artistic {{applications}} because of its deepness of color and excellent tinting strength. <b>Bone</b> <b>black</b> and ivory black are artists' pigments which are in use since historic times by painters such as Rembrandt and Velázquez but also more recently by Manet or Picasso. The black dresses and high hats of the gentlemen in Manet's Music in the Tuileries are painted in ivory black.|$|R
3000|$|Black Pigments Charcoal Black, Lamp <b>Black,</b> Ivory <b>Black,</b> <b>Bone</b> <b>Black,</b> Graphite, Black Chalk and Terre-noire (Black Earth) {{are among}} the list of black pigments. Well ground {{charcoal}} has often been used as black pigment. In India, charcoal prepared from twigs and woods of tamarind tree after burning in a closed pot, is powdered to make black pigment. Some other substances which after charring were used for preparing black pigment are the shells of almonds and coconuts. The charcoal so produced is soft and gives homogeneous and fine black pigment. By far, the most important black used India is ‘Kajal’ prepared by burning oil in a lamp and depositing the soot on an earthen bowl. Ivory black is prepared by charring ivory cuttings in a closed earthen pot and then grinding, washing and drying black residue. The black so prepared is very intense. It is not favoured now for ecological and animal rights considerations. <b>Bone</b> <b>black</b> is prepared by charring animal bones in closed earthen pots. It is not as intense as ivory black but used as a substitute. Powdered graphite, a mineral found {{in different parts of}} India, has been used as writing material. It gives a dull grey pigment. However, it has mostly been used for drawing rather than for painting. Black chalk is the name given to black clay used for paintings and terracotta. Terre-noire is the same as black clay. It is a mixture of carbonate of calcium, iron and manganese with clay.|$|R

60|$|At {{some time}} or other {{there had been}} a native village at this spot; {{probably}} the Zulus had cleaned it out in long past years, for I found human <b>bones</b> <b>black</b> with age lying in the long grass. Indeed, the cattle-kraal still remained and in such good condition that by piling up a few stones here and there on the walls and closing the narrow entrances with thorn bushes, we could still use it to enclose our oxen at night. This I did for fear lest there should be lions about, though I had neither seen nor heard them.|$|R
30|$|In addition, calcium is {{also found}} in the shadow that the figure casts on the wall, but no iron is present here.

This finding will contribute to the updating of an already proposed colour reconstruction image of Magritte’s La pose enchantée [4, 18].|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} Chinese {{method of}} making the ink was to grind a mixture of hide glue, carbon <b>black,</b> lampblack, and <b>bone</b> <b>black</b> pigment with a pestle and mortar, then pouring it into a ceramic dish where it could dry. To use the dry mixture, a wet brush would be applied until it reliquified, or more commonly in East Asian calligraphy, grind against an inkstone. The manufacture of India ink was well-established by the Cao Wei dynasty (220 - 265 AD). Historically the ink used in China were {{in the form of}} ink sticks made of lampblack and animal glue.|$|R

30|$|Prussian blue is {{the primary}} blue pigment in both paintings. As stated above, very small amounts of {{vermilion}} red were found uniformly mixed into all Prussian hues. Chrome or cadmium yellow particles are also found mixed into Prussian blue paint in some samples (sample X 2, X 14). In the hidden portrait, Prussian blue is mixed with a carbon-based black (see, for example, sample X 7, layer 2). The dark blue color resulting from the mixture can be seen where a loss in the surface paint layers exposes the underlying paint near the sitter’s right elbow (see detail, Fig.  3 c). Carbon-based black, mixed with Prussian blue in sample X 4 and used pure in sample X 6, layer 3, was identified as <b>bone</b> <b>black</b> due to the detection of calcium and phosphorus by SEM-EDX analysis. In another sample—X 1, layer 6 —µFT-IR spectra identifies barium sulfate mixed with black (see Additional file 4 : Table S 4). A small but sharp peak around 985  cm− 1 is indicative of barium sulfate, although the combination of pigments appears to create a broad peak from 1250 to 900  cm− 1 which masks adjacent barium sulfate peaks. While corresponding peaks at ~ 1100  cm− 1 and between ~ 1400 and 1750  cm− 1 in the sample suggest <b>bone</b> <b>black,</b> a smaller peak at ~ 2150  cm− 1 is shifted {{too far from the}} standard for a positive assignment in this sample.|$|R
