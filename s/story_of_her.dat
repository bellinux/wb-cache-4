5|$|After the Gibraltar hearings, Mary Celeste {{continued}} in service under new owners. In 1885, her captain deliberately wrecked her {{off the coast of}} Haiti, as part of an attempted insurance fraud. The <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> 1872 abandonment has been recounted and dramatized many times, in documentaries, novels, plays and films, {{and the name of the}} ship has become a byword for unexplained desertion.|$|E
5|$|Scholar John Lindow {{proposes that}} a {{potentially}} understated mythological importance of Sif's {{role in the}} <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sheared hair exists; her headpiece is created along with {{the most important and}} powerful items in Norse mythology. Lindow further states that it may be easy to lose sight of the central role Sif plays in the creation of these objects.|$|E
5|$|She finally narrates the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{abandonment}} to Jug, {{who tells}} {{her that she}} fears abandonment {{so much that she}} does not allow herself to commit in relationships, leaving before they can leave her. He convinces her that she does not need to forgive her parents for abandoning her, but she can, as an adult, see them as two regular people who made a mistake. After this, Kaira makes an effort to reconcile with her parents and also works to finish her short film.|$|E

5|$|According to legend, Murasaki {{retreated to}} Ishiyama-dera at Lake Biwa, {{where she was}} {{inspired}} to write The Tale of Genji on an August night while looking at the moon. Although scholars dismiss the factual basis of the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> retreat, Japanese artists often depicted her at Ishiyama Temple staring at the moon for inspiration. She may have been commissioned to write the story and may have known an exiled courtier in a similar position to her hero Prince Genji. Murasaki would have distributed newly written chapters of Genji to friends who in turn would have re-copied them and passed them on. By this practice the story became known and she gained a reputation as an author.|$|E
5|$|Asher {{broke off}} the {{engagement}} in early 1968, after {{coming back from}} an acting assignment in Bristol to find McCartney in bed with another woman, Francie Schwartz. McCartney and Asher later attempted to mend their relationship, but finally broke up in July1968. Asher has consistently refused to publicly discuss {{that part of her}} life. Schwartz, a twenty three year old New York scriptwriter, had travelled to London trying to interest Apple Corps in a film script. Schwartz was then asked by McCartney to move into his Cavendish Avenue house, and was given a job working for Derek Taylor at Apple, which was then based in Wigmore Street, London. She attended many sessions during the recording of the White Album, and was living with McCartney when Lennon and Yoko Ono were also invited to live there. Shortly after, Schwartz sold the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> time at Cavendish Avenue to Rolling Stone magazine.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Mansour {{was offered}} {{money for the}} film rights to the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> life.

5|$|She {{was part}} of a {{flotilla}} which toured ports during the summer of 1889. Zhiyuans sole action was at the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894 during the First Sino-Japanese War. During the battle, she came under heavy fire from the Japanese forces. Having been holed, Deng ordered for the ship to ram an opposing vessel. She was destroyed as she closed, either by a hit on one of her torpedo tubes, or from a Japanese torpedo. This attack, and the subsequent <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> captain and his dog have become embedded in popular culture in the People's Republic of China. A replica of the Zhiyuan was constructed in 2014 at the Port of Dandong, while the wreck was discovered in 2013 after a 16-year search.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Alien led 20th Century Fox to finance three direct sequels {{over the next}} {{eighteen}} years, each by different writers and directors. Sigourney Weaver remained the only recurring actor through all four films: the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> character Ripley's encounters with the Aliens became the thematic and narrative core of the series. James Cameron's Aliens (1986) focused more on action and involved Ripley returning to the planetoid accompanied by marines to confront hordes of Aliens. David Fincher's Alien 3 (1992) had nihilistic tones and found her on a prison planet battling another Alien, ultimately sacrificing herself to prevent her employers from acquiring the creatures. Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Alien Resurrection (1997) saw Ripley resurrected through cloning to battle more Aliens even further in the future.|$|E

In the shoot-out Darius successfully calls in the airstrike at the cost of his own life and Leiter survives only thanks to the timely arrival of Hamid, his taxi driver.

Later Gorner meets him on a boat and tries to shoot him, but Bond pushes him overboard, where he is torn to pieces by a propeller. With the subsequent elimination of both Chagrin and Gorner, Bond considers his mission a success, and on condition that the agent M has waiting in the wings will not take his place Bond is sent to assess the new agent, designated 004. She turns out to be Scarlett Papava. Scarlett discloses that the <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> twin sister was a ploy to convince Bond to enable her to join the mission.

5|$|The series {{revolves}} around the lives of Jaypaw, Lionpaw and Hollypaw, kits of Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight and grandchildren of the ThunderClan leader Firestar. The three slowly {{come to terms with}} their unique paths in life; Lionpaw worries about his thirst for blood on the battlefield, Hollypaw considers {{what it means to be}} truly loyal to her Clan, and Jaypaw is bitter that he was born blind. One day, Jaypaw unintentionally discovers a prophecy that he believes refers to him and his siblings. The three attempt to understand their new destinies, and realize that Lionpaw has the power to never be harmed in battle, whilst Jaypaw can walk in the dreams and read the minds of other cats. Hollypaw, on the other hand, struggles to determine what her unique power is. Hollypaw and Lionpaw are made warriors, becoming Hollyleaf and Lionblaze respectively, whilst Jaypaw becomes a medicine cat and is later given the name Jayfeather. They seek the advice of a mysterious loner named Sol, who promises to give them the answers to their destinies; however, they eventually realize him to be a deceptive liar, and he is banished from the forest. Although uncertain of their powers, the three cats are always secure in the knowledge that they are deeply loved by their parents. This safe haven is shattered when they are forced into a fire by Ashfur, another ThunderClan warrior. Ashfur wishes to murder the three cats in order to punish their mother, Squirrelflight, for rejecting his love years earlier. However, Squirrelflight admits that the three cats are not her offspring, and Ashfur lets them go. The siblings are deeply distressed by this confession, and attempt to discover who their true parents are. They eventually learn that their mother is Leafpool, the ThunderClan medicine cat, and their father is Crowfeather, a WindClan warrior. Hollyleaf is devastated by this, and murders Ashfur in revenge. Unsatisfied, she then publicly announces to the rest of the Clans the true <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> heritage. When the Clans do not praise her for her honesty, but rather react with shock and confusion, Hollyleaf runs away into a series of collapsing tunnels. Presuming her to be dead, and numb with grief for their sister, Lionblaze and Jayfeather realize that Hollyleaf never had a power in the first place. They instead turn their eyes to two kits newly born in the Clan, one of whom could fulfill the third role in the prophecy.|$|E
