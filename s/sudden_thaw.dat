60|$|Early in April Fergus {{suddenly}} broke down. His {{work had}} been almost incessant. The cold in the tent had, at night, been extreme; and, having been wetted to the skin one day, when a <b>sudden</b> <b>thaw</b> came on, his clothes had been frozen stiff when, at nightfall, the frost returned with even greater severity than before. In spite of the cloaks and blankets that Karl heaped upon his bed, he shivered all night, {{and in the morning}} hot fits came on. The king's surgeon, coming in to see him, pronounced that the chill had resulted in what was probably rheumatic fever.|$|E
60|$|But the {{careless}} and the fearful were alike {{sleeping in}} their beds now. There was hope that the rain would abate by the morrow; threatenings of a worse kind, from <b>sudden</b> <b>thaws</b> after falls of snow, had often passed off, {{in the experience of}} the younger ones; and at the very worst, the banks would be sure to break lower down the river when the tide came in with violence, and so the waters would be carried off, without causing more than temporary inconvenience, and losses that would be felt only by the poorer sort, whom charity would relieve.|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{water level}} fluctuations in lakes {{and the associated}} changes in the lake surface and water resources in the years 1992 - 2011. On the basis of detailed field studies {{carried out in the}} hydrological year 2011, short-term and dynamic changes in the lakes’ hydrology were determined. Changes in hydrological lake types were evoked by unexpected hydro-meteorological situations, in particular high precipitation totals and <b>sudden</b> <b>thaws</b> in winter. The main symptom of the lake type change was the restoration, after nearly 10 years, of channels connecting the lakes. In addition, a strong interdependence was recorded in the difference between evaporation and precipitation, as well as the mean annual ranges of lake water levels in the years 1992 - 201...|$|R
50|$|The Arena was {{an idea of}} Godfrey Dewey, {{president}} of the Organizing Committee, after he saw what <b>sudden</b> <b>thaws</b> had done to the Winter Olympics both in Chamonix and in St. Moritz. A visit by International Olympic Committee President Count Henri de Baillet-Latour in September 1930 encouraged Dewey to construct the indoor arena. This was approved at a board meeting later that month to investigation. Discussions ensued among the Olympic organizers until a site was approved in April 1931. Property was purchased in June of that year followed by an approval of a municipal bond in July. Construction took place between August 1931 and January 1932. Over 9 mi of steel pipes were laid {{down on the floor}} to help make the ice.|$|R
60|$|This {{was so far}} satisfactory. Our three {{travellers}} {{were quite}} charmed with their proficiency in the new mode of progression, when a <b>sudden</b> <b>thaw</b> set in and damped not only their spirits but their shoes. The netting and lines became flabby. The moccasins, with which Hendrick had supplied them from the bundle he carried for his own use, were reduced to something {{of the nature of}} tripe. The damp snow, which when rendered powdery by frost had fallen through the net-work of the shoes, now fell upon it in soft heaps and remained there, increasing the weight so much as to wrench joints and strain muscles, while the higher temperature rendered exertion fatiguing and clothing unbearable.|$|E
6000|$|... “Summer {{was late}} that year, and we hauled the hand-sledges {{two hundred miles}} over the snow; but I needn’t tell you about our journey. We made it with some trouble, and one {{afternoon}} {{came down to the}} creek, wet and worn out, plowing through belts of melting snow and soft muskegs made by the <b>sudden</b> <b>thaw.</b> I had hide moccasins which were generally soaked and they had given out under the fastenings of the snowshoes. My foot, which had been frost-bitten on the march when I first found the mine, was cut deep, and it cost me a pretty grim effort to hold out for the last few miles. I made it because I couldn’t let another night come before I learned my luck. All I had was in the venture, and if it failed I must go back to camp destitute.” ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{and then}} for several days {{together}} we sat in our log-built shelter while a blinding snowstorm raged outside and the pines filled the valley with their roaring. Then there were weeks of bitter frost, when work was partly suspended, and both rock and soil defied our efforts. One of our best horses died and another fell over a precipice. Hay was hardly to be bought with money, provisions only at an exorbitant cost, and though we received a few interim payments it was, as Johnston said, even chances either way if we kept on top, because every day of enforced idleness cost us many dollars. However, floundering through snow-slush, swinging the axe in driving sleet and rain, or hauling the mossy logs through the mire of a <b>sudden</b> <b>thaw,</b> we persisted in our task, though often at nights we sat inside the shanty, which was filled with steaming garments, counting the cost, {{in a state of}} gloomy despondency. Except for the thought of Grace, there were moments when I might have yielded; but we were always an obstinate race, and seeing that I was steadfastly determined to hold out to the last, the others gallantly aided me. Now, when the time of stress is past, I know how much I owe to their loyalty.|$|E
50|$|Flash floods {{most often}} occur in {{normally}} dry {{areas that have}} recently received precipitation, {{but they may be}} seen anywhere downstream from the source of the precipitation, even many miles from the source. In areas on or near volcanoes, flash floods have also occurred after eruptions, when glaciers have been melted by the intense heat. Flash floods are known to occur in the highest mountain ranges of the United States and are also common in the arid plains of the Southwestern United States. Flash flooding can also be caused by extensive rainfall released by hurricanes and other tropical storms, as well as the <b>sudden</b> <b>thawing</b> effect of ice dams. Human activities can also cause flash floods to occur. When dams fail, a large quantity of water can be released and destroy everything in its path.|$|R
50|$|Ice storms {{are also}} known as a Silver storm, {{referring}} to the color of the freezing precipitation. Ice storms are caused by liquid precipitation which freezes upon cold surfaces and leads to the gradual development of a thickening layer of ice.The accumulations of ice during the storm can be extremely destructive. Trees and vegetation can be destroyed and in turn may bring down power lines, causing the loss of heat and communication lines. Roofs of buildings and automobiles may be severely damaged. Gas pipes can become frozen or even damaged causing gas leaks. Avalanches may develop due to the extra weight of the ice present. Visibility can be reduced dramatically. The aftermath of an ice storm may result in severe flooding due to <b>sudden</b> <b>thawing,</b> with large quantities of displaced water, especially near lakes, rivers, and bodies of water.|$|R
50|$|Chukotsky {{district}} endures extreme arctic weather, with {{an average}} winter low of -22 C in January, though Uelen's average January temperature is slightly higher at -19 C. The average July temperature is also fractionally higher at +5.9 C than the district average for the month at +5.4 C, and the overall annual average of -6.7 C is also higher than the district average of -8.2 C. Snow storms in the winter from the north cause harsh frosts and drifting snow, whilst southerly blizzards bring large snowfalls and <b>sudden</b> <b>thaws.</b> The area is also very windy, reaching 35 m/s annually and 50 m/s every two decades. Spring weather is a little milder than winter weather if still below freezing. Due {{to the position of}} Uelen by the sea coast there are also many instances of fog and mist per year with the result that sunshine hours are very low especially when the adjacent ocean begins to thaw.|$|R

50|$|Mudflows can {{be caused}} by unusually heavy rains or a <b>sudden</b> <b>thaw.</b> They consist mainly of mud and water plus {{fragments}} of rock and other debris, so they often behave like floods.

40|$|Abstract: Polish water {{resources}} depend on precipitations, which are variable {{in time and}} space. In dry years the water balance is negative in central parts of Poland but <b>sudden</b> <b>thaws</b> and downfalls may result in periodical water excess and dangerous floods almost in the entire country. The retention capacity of artificial reservoirs in Poland permits to store only 6 % of the average annual runoff, which is commonly considered insufficient. Another method to increase retention is soil water con-trol. About fifty percent of soils in Poland consist of light and very light sandy soils with low water capacity. Loams and organogenic soils cover approximately 25 % and 8. 5 % area of the country, re-spectively. Almost half of agricultural lands (48 %) have relatively good water conditions, but the rest requires soil water control measures. An increase of the soil water content could be achieved by changes of soil properties, water table control and soil water management. Modernization and recon-struction of drainage and irrigation systems, which were built mainly in the period 1960 – 1980, is needed. Key words: drainage, irrigation, soil water retention, subirrigation, water management, water re-source...|$|R
5000|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{can lead}} to a number of hazards, most of which are floods or hazards resulting from floods. Flooding is the inundation of areas that are not normally under water. It is typically divided into three classes: River flooding, which relates to rivers rising outside their normals banks; flash flooding, which is the process where a landscape, often in urban and arid environments, is subjected to rapid floods; and coastal flooding, which can be caused by strong winds from tropical or non-tropical cyclones. Meteorologically, excessive rains occur within a plume of air with high amounts of moisture (also known as an atmospheric river) which is directed around an upper level cold-core low or a tropical cyclone. [...] Flash flooding can frequently occur in slow-moving thunderstorms and are usually caused by the heavy liquid precipitation that accompanies it. Flash floods are most common in dense populated urban environments, where less plants and bodies of water are presented to absorb and contain the extra water. Flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure, such as bridges, and weakly constructed buildings. Plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated by the force of raging water. Automobiles parked within experiencing areas can also be displaced. Soil erosion can occur as well, exposing risks of landslide phenomena. Like all forms of flooding phenomenon, flash flooding can also spread and produce waterborne and insect-borne diseases cause by microorganisms. Flash flooding can be caused by extensive rainfall released by tropical cyclones of any strength or the <b>sudden</b> <b>thawing</b> effect of ice dams.|$|R
50|$|The Battle of Nantwich {{was fought}} during the First English Civil War, between the Parliamentarians and Royalists, {{northwest}} {{of the town of}} Nantwich in Cheshire on 25 January 1644. The Royalists under Lord Byron were besieging Nantwich, and Sir Thomas Fairfax led an army to relieve the town. As Fairfax approached, a <b>sudden</b> <b>thaw</b> caused the River Weaver to rise in spate, dividing Byron's cavalry from his infantry and artillery, who were overrun and destroyed by Fairfax.|$|E
50|$|During Christmas 1927, {{heavy snow}} {{fell in the}} Cotswolds in central England, where the Thames has its source. A <b>sudden</b> <b>thaw</b> {{occurred}} over the New Year's Eve of 1928, followed by unusually heavy rain, doubling the volume of water coming down the river. The sudden rise in water level coincided with a high spring tide and a storm surge caused by a major extratropical cyclone in the North Sea. The storm surge raised the water levels in the Thames Estuary, measured at Southend, to 1.5 metres (4 ft) above normal.|$|E
50|$|In January 89, Saturninus led a revolt. He {{expected}} his Germanic {{allies to}} cross the Rhine to support him, but were prevented by a <b>sudden</b> <b>thaw</b> of the river Rhine, and the revolt was quickly put down by Domitian's general Lucius Appius Maximus Norbanus, who afterwards burned Saturninus' letters {{in an attempt to}} avoid implicating others. However, Domitian had numerous others executed with Saturninus, displaying their heads on the rostra at Rome. The Legio XXI was sent to Pannonia, and Domitian passed a law prohibiting two legions from sharing the same camp.|$|E
50|$|On 24 January, Fairfax's force {{scattered}} a small Royalist force which {{attempted to}} bar {{the road to}} Nantwich at Delamere Forest. Byron decided to maintain the siege, {{but the next day}} there was a <b>sudden</b> <b>thaw</b> which caused the Weaver to rise in spate. Byron ordered his infantry and artillery to move to {{the west bank of the}} Weaver around Acton, where the ground was drier, but the bridge at Beam Bridge (and a ferry to its north) were then swept away by the floodwater while Byron himself and his 1,800 cavalry were still on the east bank. He was forced to make a march of 6 mi via another bridge at Minshull Vernon to support his infantry at Acton.|$|E
50|$|He {{served the}} stadthouder William III of Orange in Bodegraven during the Rampjaar. When 10,000 French troops {{under the command}} of François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg arrived over the frozen ice of the Hollandic Water Line from Woerden on 27 December 1672, he retreated to Leiden. There the councilman Cornelis Hop and others kept the gates closed and ordered him back to Alphen aan de Rijn in order to defend the Water Line at Gouwsluis. His retreat enabled the Duke of Luxembourg to murder all at Bodegraven and Zwammerdam and he {{prepared}} to make an attack on The Hague. A <b>sudden</b> <b>thaw</b> forced them back to Woerden however, but Königsmarck was seen as a coward.Königsmarck died in the Siege of Bonn.|$|E
50|$|Adding to the Allied difficulties, the German states, {{although}} having promised Louis {{to remain}} neutral, had become very worried by the French success and especially by {{its refusal to}} withdraw from the Duchy of Cleves. On 25 July, the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, Leopold I, concluded a defensive treaty with the Republic in The Hague and, together with Brandenburg, of which Cleves was a dependency and which had declared itself a Dutch ally on 6 May, sent an army of forty thousand to the Rhine. Though this force did not attack the French army, its presence was enough to draw it to the east in response. On 27 December after a severe frost, the Duc de Luxembourg began to cross the ice of the Water Line with eight thousand men, hoping to sack The Hague. A <b>sudden</b> <b>thaw</b> cut his force in half and he narrowly escaped to his own lines with the remainder.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} recent snowy winters was 2008-09, when, in mid-December, cold {{temperatures}} from an Arctic front collided with moist air from the pacific; over 100 cm of snow fell throughout December and temperatures stayed below 0 C for over 2 weeks, which, in effect, resulted in an extreme snow cover of 50 cm for Christmas. In {{the first two weeks of}} January 2009, a <b>sudden</b> <b>thaw</b> induced by a Pineapple Express caused heavy rain to fall. However, due to the further distance away from the coast and the slightly higher elevation of Coquitlam in comparison to other communities in Metro Vancouver, all of the precipitation that fell in the first week of January 2009 was heavy, wet snow which produced a snow cover of 70 cm. Flooding was a concern in low-lying areas near the Fraser River. After the winter of 2008-09 ended, about 190 cm of snow had fallen.|$|E
50|$|The 55th Army, in the meantime, had {{advanced}} despite heavy casualties inflicted by the dug-in Spanish troops. The Soviets took Raikelevo, which cut off Podolvo from Krasny Bor. In Krasny Bor itself the Spanish artillery, engineers and other assorted stragglers {{came under attack}} from Soviet infantry and armour, and by 12:00, the 63rd Guards Rifle Division reported the capture of Krasny Bor, {{despite the fact that}} the southern half of the town was still controlled by the Spanish. Soviet tanks opened fire on a hospital and retreating ambulances but were eventually beaten off by Spanish troops armed with Molotov Cocktails and hand grenades. The afternoon brought belated support for the defenders in the form of a Luftwaffe fighter-bomber attack on the Soviet positions around the town of Kolpino, to the north of Krasny Bor, while the 45th Guards Rifle Division seized Mishkino. Sviridov decided to insert the mobile group into the battle late on the day, but they were stopped by a combination of fierce resistance and a <b>sudden</b> <b>thaw</b> that stopped the Ski Brigade from operating off road. The German command reinforced the Spanish defenses with battle groups.|$|E
50|$|At {{the opening}} of the War of Devolution (1667-68), Condé, and {{consequently}} Luxembourg, had no command, but during the second campaign he served as Condé's lieutenant general in the conquest of Franche-Comté. During the four years of peace which followed, Luxembourg cultivated the favour of Louvois, and in 1672 held a high command against the Dutch during the Franco-Dutch War. He defeated a counterattack by the forces of Prince William III of Orange at Woerden but was blocked by the Dutch Water Line. On 27 December the inundations were frozen over and he began to cross over the ice, but a <b>sudden</b> <b>thaw</b> cut his force in half. Retreating, de Luxembourg found the fortress town of Bodegraven abandoned by its garrison and ordered the entire civilian population to be burned alive with their houses. The Dutch anti-French propaganda quickly exploited this massacre and when de Luxembourg bragged to Louis XIV that he had roasted any Dutchman he could find in the town, he {{was surprised to find that}} some at court considered such cruelties unnecessary. In 1673 he made his famous retreat from Utrecht to Maastricht with only 20,000 men in face of 70,000, an exploit which placed him in the first rank of generals.|$|E
50|$|During {{the winter}} of 1916, heavy {{snowfall}} and a <b>sudden</b> <b>thaw</b> in the Alps created conditions ripe for avalanches. From the beginning of December, the snow pile up was recorded at 8-12 meters atop the summit. The Austro-Hungarian commander of the 1.Btl. KschRgt.III, Captain Rudolf Schmid, noticed the imminent danger his company faced. Out of fear his position would be soon untenable, Capt. Schmid wrote a request to his superior, Field Marshal Lieutenant Ludwig Goinger of the 90th Infantry Division. The appeal was ultimately turned down to vacate the base atop Gran Poz summit. In the eight days prior to the avalanche, additional heavy snowfall disrupted telephone lines of communication and left each outpost stranded {{with a lack of}} supplies.On , December 13, 1916, at 05:30, over 200 000 tons (approx. 1 million cubic meters) of snow and ice plunged down the mountainside directly onto the barracks. The wooden buildings packed with soldiers, collapsed {{under the weight of the}} avalanche, crushing the occupants. Of the 321 troops present, 229 were Kaiserschützen mountain infantry and 102 were Bosnians from a support column. Only a few were pulled to safety while 270 were buried alive. Only 40 of the bodies were ever recovered from the pileup. Among those who survived was Captain Schmid along with his aide, who escaped slightly injured.|$|E
