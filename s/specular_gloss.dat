50|$|Early work in 1925 by Pfund {{led to the}} {{development}} of a variable angle “glossimeter” to measure <b>specular</b> <b>gloss</b> which was later patented in 1932. Pfund’s instrument, allowed the angle of measurement to be varied, but maintained the angle of view to the angle of illumination. Reflected light was measured using a pyrometer lamp as a photometer. The ‘glossimeter’ was the first to use black glass standards as a basis for reflectance setting. As the angle was variable this instrument could also be used for the measurement of sheen or <b>specular</b> <b>gloss</b> at near grazing angles.|$|E
40|$|Glossy and matte objects can be {{differentiated}} using specular highlights: bright patches in the retinal image produced when {{light rays}} are reflected regularly from smooth surfaces. However, bright patches also occur on matte objects, due to local illumination or reflectance changes. Binocular vision provides {{information that could}} distinguish specular highlights from other luminance discontinuities; unlike surface markings, specular highlights lie not at the surface depth, but ‘‘float’’ in front of concave surfaces and behind convex ones. We ask whether observers implicitly understand and exploit the peculiarities of <b>specular</b> geometry for <b>gloss</b> and shape perception. Our participants judged the glossiness and shape of curved surfaces that included specular highlights at various depths. Observers demonstrated substantial deviations from a full geometric model of specular reflection. Concave surfaces appeared glossy both when highlights lay in front of and (incorrectly) behind the surface. Failings {{in the interpretation of}} monocular highlights were also apparent. Highlight disparity had no effect on shape perception. However, the perceived gloss of convex surfaces did follow geometric constraints: only highlights at appropriate depths produced high gloss ratings. We suggest, in contrast with previous work, that the visual system invokes simple heuristics as gloss indicators to accommodate complex reflections and inter-reflections that occur particularly inside concavities...|$|R
40|$|It is {{advisable}} to clarify {{what is meant}} by several terms describing the types of reflectance and transmittance from a surface as illustrated in Fig. 2. 20. A polished glass surface would have specular reflectance and regular transmittance (if it is not opaque). A ground glass surface would have diffuse reflectance and diffuse transmittance. Chalk would have diffuse reflectance. Varnished wood, polished stone, and glazed tile would have some <b>specular</b> component or <b>gloss</b> and some diffuse reflectance; it would have mixed specular and diffuse reflectance. Fig. 2. 20. Three types of reflecting surfaces. A special “ideal ” case of diffuse reflectance is when the reflected light intensity follows the cosine or Lambert’s Law as seen in Fig. 2. 21. The integrating sphere is discussed elsewhere, which would ideally have a very highly reflecting and totally diffuse surface which is “Lambertian ” in its reflectance. Fig. 2. 21.

40|$|Our senses {{allow us}} to {{identify}} objects, materials and events {{in the world around}} us,enabling us to interact effectively with our surroundings. However, perception is inherently ambiguous, in that each set of sensory data could have resulted from an infinite number of world states. To find statistically optimal solutions the brain uses the available sensory data together with its prior knowledge or experience. In addition, when there are multiple cues available they may be: (i) combined to improve precision through noise reduction; and/or (ii) recalibrated to improve accuracy through bias reduction. This thesis investigates cue combination, learning and recalibration through a series of four studies, using the Bayesian framework to model cues and their interactions. The first study finds that haptic cues to material properties are combined with visual cues to affect estimates of object gloss. It also investigates how the binocular disparity of <b>specular</b> highlights affects <b>gloss</b> estimates. This is extended in the second study, which finds that the human visual system does not employ a full geometric model of specular highlight disparity when making shape and gloss estimates. The third study replicates and extends previous findings, that auditory and visual cues to temporal events are optimally combined in adults, by demonstrating that children also optimally combine auditory and visual cues. Both adults' and children's bimodal percepts are shown to be well predicted by a `coupling prior' model of optimal partial cue combination. The fourth study finds that the visual system can learn and invoke two context-specific priors for illumination direction, using haptic shape cues to provide calibratory feedback during training. It also demonstrates that colour can be learnt as a contextual cue. The results of all these studies are considered in the context of existing work, and ideas for future research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Common {{illumination}} {{systems in}} short wave infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) include {{direct or indirect}} tungsten halogen lights. While direct lights provide more radiation onto the samples than dome setups, thus being more energy efficient, the acquired images often suffer from <b>specular</b> reflections and <b>gloss.</b> Glare artifacts in images increase variability in the data limiting the accuracy of machine vision algorithms for defect detection and quality inspection, or even providing false positives. Although domes are known to provide a near Lambertian illumination and glare free images, glossy regions and heterogeneities may remain in the data in practice. More particularly, {{in the field of}} fruit and vegetable quality inspection, due to their waxy surface, it remains challenging to design an efficient realistic lighting system. This paper suggests a new approach to optimize the illumination of fruit and vegetables based on measurements of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), shape and Stokes parameters. From these measured values, a BRDF model is loaded into ray-tracing software for realistic illumination engineering {{in order to determine the}} most suitable illumination scheme. This concept is applied to apples and a cross polarizer (CP) with freeform optics (FO) optical configuration is proposed, which allows the FO to be optimized to maximize uniformity in the field of view of the imager and removes the parallel polarized gloss on the apples. The performance of this CP illumination system was determined experimentally for a set of apples. This cross polarized (CP) illumination system provided a uniformity (U) of 92 % and an efficiency (ν) of 90 %, while U = 87 % and ν = 14 % for an ideal dome configuration when illuminating a rectangular target. The simulated imaged apples with assigned optical properties performed better with CP (U= 80 %) than when using a dome (U= 73 %) by 7 %.

50|$|As {{measurements}} of <b>specular</b> <b>gloss</b> depend {{largely on the}} refractive index of the material being measured 20° gloss will change more noticeably than 60° gloss, therefore as haze index is calculated using these two measurements it too {{will be affected by}} the refractive index of the material.

40|$|It is a {{well known}} fact that the {{incorporation}} of so-called flatting agents into clear finishes results in lowered <b>specular</b> <b>gloss</b> readings.

The <b>specular</b> <b>gloss</b> {{is among the}} major appearance properties of dental biomaterials, and its relationship with surface roughness has been reported. Roughness and gloss are key surface aspects that complement each other. We have experimentally analyzed the <b>specular</b> <b>gloss</b> and surface roughness of {{two different types of}} dental-resin composites and pre-sintered and sintered zirconia ceramics. We have studied two shades of both composite types and two sintered zirconia ceramics: colored and uncolored. Moreover, a surface treatment was applied to one specimen of each dental resin. Gloss measurements were performed with a standardized reflectometer and the corresponding gloss percentages were calculated. All the samples were submitted to rugometric non-invasive inspection with the MICROTOP. 06. MFC laser microtopographer in order to determine meaningful statistical parameters such as the average roughness (Ra) and the root-mean-square deviation (Rq). For a comparison of the different biomaterials, the uncertainties associated to the measure of the surface gloss and roughness were also determined. The differences between the two shades of both kinds of composites proved significant {{in the case of the}} roughness parameters but not for the <b>specular</b> <b>gloss.</b> The surface treatment applied to the dental-resin composites increased the average roughness but the changes in the <b>specular</b> <b>gloss</b> were significant only for the A 2 enamel nano-composite.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{correlate}} {{measurements of}} <b>specular</b> <b>gloss</b> and surface roughness of resin composite materials with subjective perception of luster {{before and after}} artificial aging. METHODS: Polished specimens of eight composites were compared with human enamel (HE) : microfilled SR Adoro (SR); microhybrid Artemis (AR), Enamel HFO (EHFO), Miris (MI), Tetric Ceram (TC), Venus (VE); and nanohybrid CeramX (CX) and nanofilled Filtek Supreme (FS). Before, during and after artificial aging (6000 thermal changes between 5 degrees C and 50 degrees C in an artificial oral environment, 240 hours storage in a container with ethanol, 300 minutes of toothbrushing), <b>specular</b> <b>gloss</b> and surface roughness were measured. Initial and endpoint gloss results were correlated with subjective luster rankings of 10 individuals.

They have a broad field of applications from the air and space technology, the automotive sector, to electrical engineering, to household products and consumer goods. The surface of a part or product strongly influences its properties and functions e. g. it's visual appearance. The gloss thereby reflects one of the most important properties of a surface when it comes to evaluate the visual appearance. Therefore, among others, in this paper the influence of laser polishing on the generated <b>specular</b> <b>gloss</b> is investigated for the hot work steel 1. 2343 (AISI: H 11). On the one hand laser polished surfaces are measured by WLI and investigated by a spectral analysis of surfaces roughness. A spectral analysis is achieved by a discrete convolution of the surface profile with a Gaussian loaded function similar to ISO 11562. On the other hand <b>specular</b> <b>gloss</b> measurements were carried out at 20 °, 60 ° and 85 °. For the experiments a fiber‐coupled solid state disc laser (Yb[*]:[*]YAG; Q‐switched) is used (PL,max = 550 W; repetition frequency: fP = 5 – 20 kHz, pulse duration: tP = 0, 7 – 3, 5 µs, pulsed and cw‐operation). In general, scanning velocity and average laser power are two crucial procedural parameters for laser polishing with significant influence on the resulting surface roughness. These procedural parameters are investigated systematically, while other procedural parameters, such as laser beam diameter dL = 250 µm and track offset dy = 25 µm were kept constant. By this a significant reduction of roughness was achieved, especially for the wavelength interval λ < 320 µm. A correlation between <b>specular</b> <b>gloss</b> of surfaces and the measured micro‐roughness is carried out. In order to make a systematic classification laser polished fields are compared to surfaces which were prepared by conventional mechanical manufacturing processes, such as turning, milling, grinding, high end manual polishing etc. <b>Specular</b> <b>gloss</b> shows a good exponential correlation with micro‐ and meso‐roughness were as macro roughness shows no significant influence on the <b>specular</b> <b>gloss.</b> Additionally, a complete process chain for selectively laser polishing of metallic surfaces was developed in order to apply different levels of gloss onto free formed work pieces.

Six commercially available instruments, manufactured by three different companies, and twenty-five gloss artifacts, with <b>specular</b> <b>gloss</b> values ranging between 2 and 110 gloss units (60 geometry), were selected for use in the study. The repeatability and reproducibility of the instruments were assessed according to the criteria described in ASTM D 523 - 14 and ISO 2813 : 2014, and to the specifications reported by the instrument manufacturers.

Lastly, we found that gloss difference scales, when expressed in terms of the samples rather than the photometric characteristics, vary little with the direction of illumination. Gloss scaling thus seems to be independent of the geometrical variations of the luminous flux at the surface of the sample. By analogy with the term "color constancy," we call this property "gloss constancy. ...|$|E
