50|$|A passive {{isolation}} system, {{such as a}} <b>shock</b> <b>mount,</b> {{in general}} contains mass, spring, and damping elements and moves as a harmonic oscillator. The mass and spring stiffness dictate a natural frequency of the system. Damping causes energy dissipation and has a secondary effect on natural frequency.|$|E

50|$|Like all {{directional}} microphones, the SM58 {{is subject}} to proximity effect, a low frequency boost when used close to the source. The cardioid response reduces pickup from the side and rear, helping to avoid feedback onstage. There are wired (with and without on/off switch) and wireless versions. The wired version provides balanced audio through a male XLR connector. The SM58 uses an internal <b>shock</b> <b>mount</b> to reduce handling noise.|$|E

50|$|Through {{extensive}} {{trial and}} error, Charles and Ray arrived at an alternate solution: create two separate pieces {{for the seat}} and backrest, joined by a plywood spine and supported by plywood legs. The result was a chair with a sleek and honest appearance. All of the connections were visible and the material was not hidden beneath upholstery. The seat was joined to the spine and legs {{with a series of}} four heavy rubber washers with nuts embedded in them (later these came to be called 'shock mounts'). The <b>shock</b> <b>mounts</b> were glued to the underside of the seat, and screwed in through the bottom of the chair. The backrest was also attached using <b>shock</b> <b>mounts.</b> From the front and top the seat and back are uninterrupted by fasteners. The rubber mounts were pliable, allowing the backrest to flex and move with the sitter. This unique technology {{is also one of the}} chair's greatest flaws. The <b>shock</b> <b>mounts</b> are glued to the wooden backrest, but may tear free for various reasons. A common response to this problem was to drill directly through the backrest and insert fasteners between the backrest and the lumbar support. This greatly devalues the chair, since it changes the original aesthetic of smooth, uninterrupted wooden forms.|$|R
5000|$|As of 2011 the GMC and Chevrolet heavy Duty's have being {{upgraded}} {{with a new}} fully boxed {{high strength}} steel frame from front to rear improving stiffness by 92% with bigger rear springs, larger engine and transmission mounts and new hydraulic body mounts to improve the ride.The front suspension incorporates new upper and lower control arms and new torsion bars tailored to one of five different gross axle weight ratings. Upper control arms are constructed from forged steel that is both stronger and lighter than the previous arms, while the new lower arms are cast iron to maximize load capacity. Using a unique torsion bar for each gross weight rating allows for better control over vehicle height, resulting in improved handling and better alignment for reduced tire wear. These improvements allow {{for up to a}} 6,000 pound front axle weight rating, allowing all 4wd trucks to accommodate a snow plow.Additional front suspension enhancements come from new urethane bump stops, two per side. The upper <b>shock</b> <b>mount</b> has been changed from a single stem mount to a two-bolt design to eliminate the possibility of squeaks and thumps. The rear suspension design uses asymmetrical leaf springs that are wider and capable of greater load handling. The design features 3-inch wide leaves, with front and rear spring sections of different lengths to reduce the twisting that can result in axle hop and loss of traction. The 2500HD use a two-stage design with a rating of 6,200 lbs, and 3500HD models have a three-stage design with 7,050 lb and 9,375 lb ratings on single and dual-wheel models respectively ...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} shock {{generated}} vibration is presented and analyzed. The fundamental background is explained {{based on the}} analysis of a single degree-of-freedom model with passive stiffness and damping. The advantages and limitations of such a <b>shock</b> <b>mount</b> are discussed. Afterwards, different semi-active strategies involving variable damping are presented. These strategies {{have been used for}} harmonic excitation {{but it is not clear}} how they will perform during a shock. This paper analyzes the different variable damping schemes already used for harmonic vibration in order to find any potential advantages or issues for theoretical shock pulse...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} shock {{generated}} vibration {{is very common}} in practice and difficult to isolate due to {{the high levels of}} excitation involved and its transient nature. If not properly isolated it could lead to large transmitted forces and displacements. Typically, classical shock isolation relies on the use of passive stiffness elements to absorb energy by deformation and some damping mechanism to dissipate residual vibration. The approach of using nonlinear stiffness elements is explored in this paper, focusing in providing an isolation system with low dynamic stiffness. The possibilities of using such a configuration for a <b>shock</b> <b>mount</b> are studied experimentally following previous theoretical models. The model studied considers electromagnets and permanent magnets in order to obtain nonlinear stiffness forces using different voltage configurations. It is found that the stiffness nonlinearities could be advantageous in improving shock isolation in terms of absolute displacement and acceleration response when compared with linear elastic elements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{forklift}} truck {{is one of}} important equipments of the modern logistics system. As the {{forklift truck}} is running, the driver seat and steering wheel of {{a certain type of}} fork-lift truck vibrate strongly, virtual prototyping technology and multi-body dynamics are used to make simulation of dynamic performance of fork-lift truck in this paper, and then the test result is compared with time course load that obtained from frame junction with the annex. We should repeatedly modify the simulation model based on test results, which is consistent with the actual results. Based on this model, so we put forward measures for improving design: Firstly, the axis of rotation of oval steering axle is implied; Secondly, the overhead guard is connected with the frame by the rubber cushion blocks at four different locations; Thirdly, the engine is fixed on the frame by the rubber cushion blocks (<b>shock</b> <b>mount)</b> in two different position. The improved simulation and experimental verification are carried out under the same conditions, and the results show that the fundamental frequency of seat of the improved fork-lift truck and vibration energy are lower. The result proves the practical value of this method in the research of the vibration characteristics of complete engineering machine...|$|E
5000|$|Relative {{costs of}} {{different}} isolation systems: Inexpensive <b>shock</b> <b>mounts</b> {{may need to}} be replaced due to dynamic loading cycles. A higher level of isolation which is effective at lower vibration frequencies and magnitudes generally costs more. Prices can range from a few dollars for bungee cords to millions of dollars for some space applications.|$|R
50|$|The Eameses {{constantly}} {{made use}} of new materials. The pair's first plywood chair—the Eames Lounge Chair Wood (LCW)—{{made use of}} a heavy rubber washer glued to the backrest {{of the chair and}} screwed to the lumbar support. These washers, which have come to be called 'shock mounts', allow the backrest to flex slightly. This technology was brought back in the 670 Lounge chair. The backrest and headrest are screwed together by a pair of aluminum supports. This unit is suspended on the seat via two connection points in the armrests. The armrests are screwed to <b>shock</b> <b>mounts</b> which are connected only via glue to the interior of the backrest shell, allowing the backrest and headrest to flex when the chair is in use. This is part of the chair's unusual design, as well as its weakest link. The <b>shock</b> <b>mounts</b> have been known to tear free causing catastrophic collapse and damage.|$|R
