5|$|Coenzymes {{are usually}} {{continuously}} regenerated and their concentrations maintained {{at a steady}} level inside the cell. For example, NADPH is regenerated through the pentose phosphate pathway and <b>S-adenosylmethionine</b> by methionine adenosyltransferase. This continuous regeneration means that small amounts of coenzymes can be used very intensively. For example, the human body turns over its own weight in ATP each day.|$|E
5|$|Coenzymes {{are small}} organic {{molecules}} {{that can be}} loosely or tightly bound to an enzyme. Coenzymes transport chemical groups from one enzyme to another. Examples include NADH, NADPH and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Some coenzymes, such as flavin mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), and tetrahydrofolate (THF), are derived from vitamins. These coenzymes cannot be synthesized by the body de novo and closely related compounds (vitamins) must be acquired from the diet. The chemical groups carried include the hydride ion (H−) carried by NAD or NADP+, the phosphate group carried by adenosine triphosphate, the acetyl group carried by coenzyme A, formyl, methenyl or methyl groups carried by folic acid and the methyl group carried by <b>S-adenosylmethionine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Methionine is {{converted}} to <b>S-adenosylmethionine</b> (SAM) by (1) methionine adenosyltransferase.|$|E
25|$|SAH riboswitches bind S-adenosylhomocysteine to {{regulate}} genes involved in recycling this metabolite that is produced when <b>S-adenosylmethionine</b> {{is used in}} methylation reactions.|$|E
25|$|<b>S-adenosylmethionine</b> (SAMe), a cosubstrate {{involved}} in methyl group transfer, {{has also been}} shown to increase cellular glutathione content in persons suffering from a disease-related glutathione deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Choline and its {{metabolites}} {{are needed}} for three main physiological purposes: structural integrity and signaling roles for cell membranes, cholinergic neurotransmission (acetylcholine synthesis), and a major source for methyl groups via its metabolite, trimethylglycine (betaine), which participates in the <b>S-adenosylmethionine</b> (SAMe) synthesis pathways.|$|E
25|$|Folate coenzymes are {{involved}} in numerous conversion processes within the body, including DNA synthesis and amino acid interconversions. Folate and vitamin B12 {{play a vital role}} in the synthesis of <b>S-adenosylmethionine,</b> which is of key importance in the maintenance and repairment of all cells, including neurons. In addition, folate has been linked to the maintenance of adequate brain levels of cofactors necessary for chemicals reactions that lead to the synthesis of serotonin and catecholamine neurotransmitters.|$|E
2500|$|Pyruvate {{has been}} {{proposed}} in 2007 as a treatment option. N-acetyl cysteine reverses many models of mitochondrial dysfunction.. In the case of mood disorders, specifically bipolar disorder, it is hypothesized that N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR), <b>S-adenosylmethionine</b> (SAMe), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), creatine monohydrate (CM), and melatonin could be potential treatment options.|$|E
2500|$|In animals, {{biosynthesis}} {{begins with}} the amino acid serine. [...] The sulfur is derived from methionine, which is converted to homocysteine through the intermediate <b>S-adenosylmethionine.</b> [...] Cystathionine beta-synthase then combines homocysteine and serine to form the asymmetrical thioether cystathionine. [...] The enzyme cystathionine gamma-lyase converts the cystathionine into cysteine and alpha-ketobutyrate. [...] In plants and bacteria, cysteine biosynthesis also starts from serine, which is converted [...] to O-acetylserine by the enzyme serine transacetylase. The enzyme O-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase, using sulfide sources, converts this ester into cysteine, releasing acetate.|$|E

50|$|MTHFR {{activity}} may be inhibited by binding of dihydrofolate (DHF) and <b>S-adenosylmethionine</b> (SAM, or AdoMet). MTHFR {{can also be}} phosphorylated - this decreases its activity by ~20% and allows it to be more easily inhibited by SAM.|$|E
