40|$|Line-transect {{surveys are}} {{commonly}} used for sampling large mammals, but estimates of the effort needed to reliably surveying low-diversity assemblages of mammals are scarce. Using data from line-transects and species accumulation curves, I examined {{whether or not a}} sampling effort previously suggested to survey mammals elsewhere (ca. 85 - 100 km) would be satisfactory for surveying a low-diversity assemblage of large mammals in the Rio Negro basin in northern Amazonia. In total, 14 mammals were recorded after an accumulated effort of 690 km walked. The desired threshold of completeness was only achieved in one of six transects after an average effort of 115 km surveyed. Considering the entire landscape (all transects pooled), survey completeness was reached after a much higher effort. Moreover, the theoretical effort required to achieve completeness was estimated to be 150 - 360 km per transect, and 512 km for the landscape. Further studies are required to fully understand this issue, but meanwhile it is <b>safest</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> that higher sampling efforts should be employed when surveying low-diversity assemblages through diurnal line-transects in northwestern Amazonia to get robust estimates of mammal richness...|$|R

25|$|The {{authenticity}} of Philo's {{description of a}} cardan suspension has been doubted by some authors {{on the ground that}} the part of Philo's Pneumatica which describes the use of the gimbal survived only in an Arabic translation of the early 9th century. Thus, the sinologist Joseph Needham suspected Arab interpolation as late as 1965. However, Carra de Vaux, author of the French translation which still provides the basis for modern scholars, regards the Pneumatics as essentially genuine. The historian of technology George Sarton (1959) also asserts that it is <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> the Arabic version is a faithful copying of Philo's original, and credits Philon explicitly with the invention. So does his colleague Michael Lewis (2001). In fact, research by the latter scholar (1997) demonstrates that the Arab copy contains sequences of Greek letters which fell out of use after the 1st century, thereby strengthening the case that it is a faithful copy of the Hellenistic original, a view recently also shared by the classicist Andrew Wilson (2002).|$|E

500|$|There is {{evidence}} that Offa constructed a series of defensive burhs, or fortified towns; the locations are not generally agreed on but may include Bedford, Hereford, Northampton, Oxford and Stamford. In addition to their defensive uses, these burhs {{are thought to have}} been administrative centres, serving as regional markets and indicating a transformation of the Mercian economy away from its origins as a grouping of midland peoples. The burhs are forerunners of the defensive network successfully implemented by Alfred the Great a century later to deal with the Danish invasions. However, Offa did not necessarily understand the economic changes that came with the burhs, so it is not <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> he envisioned all their benefits. In 749, Æthelbald of Mercia had issued a charter that freed ecclesiastical lands from all obligations except the requirement to build forts and bridges– obligations which lay upon everyone, as part of the trinoda necessitas. Offa's Kentish charters show him laying these same burdens on the recipients of his grants there, and this may be a sign that the obligations were being spread outside Mercia. These burdens were part of Offa's response to the threat of [...] "the pagan seaman".|$|E

Too bad then that it was so underwhelming." [...] The Guardian writer Stuart Heritage stated; [...] "Last night's Hounds of Baskervilles wasn't quite as rapturously received as other adventures, perhaps because of {{the amount of time that}} Cumberbatch and Freeman spent apart. The whole middle section, where Watson stormed off in a huff after being subjected to another one of Sherlock's baroque [...] "that man is left-handed and also has dog hair on one of his socks" [...] monologues, felt slow and flat precisely because there was none of the chemistry between the two leads that we've come to expect from Sherlock."

500|$|But {{there is}} some {{opposition}} {{to the idea of}} an empowered global parliament. A 2007 BBC poll of approximately 12,000 respondents asked, [...] "How likely would you be to support a Global Parliament, where votes are based on country population sizes, and the global parliament is able to make binding policies?" [...] Of those polled, 19.1% responded [...] "Very unlikely–it is a bad idea"; 14.9% responded [...] "Quite unlikely–but it might work"; 23.1% said [...] "Quite likely–but with reservations"; and 14.4% said [...] "Very likely–it is a good idea". The poll was broken out by country, and the U.S. and Australia showed the strongest opposition. Potential challenge to the UNPA are political organizations such as the U.S. Constitution Party, and politicians such as 2008 U.S. presidential candidate Ron Paul, which favor withdrawal from the United Nations and other multilateral organizations altogether due to sovereignty concerns. Canadian Action Party leader Connie Fogal also opposes the UNPA, saying, [...] "It is very revealing to see the NDP and the Greens as part of and promoting this...Further, the European assembly {{has proven to be a}} rubber stamping mechanism of bureaucratic decisions.

60|$|Subsequently to my experiments, M. Martens tried similar ones, {{but in a}} {{much better}} manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea, so that they were {{alternately}} wet and exposed to the air like really floating plants. He tried 98 seeds, mostly different from mine; but he chose many large fruits and likewise seeds from plants which live near the sea; and this would have favoured the average length of their flotation and of their resistance to the injurious action of the salt-water. On the other hand he did not previously dry the plants or branches with the fruit; and this, as we have seen, would have caused some of them to have floated much longer. The result was that 18/98 of his seeds floated for 42 days, and were then capable of germination. But I do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves would float for a less time than those protected from violent movement as in our experiments. Therefore it would perhaps be <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> that the seeds of about 10/100 plants of a flora, after having been dried, could be floated across a space of sea 900 miles in width, and would then germinate. The fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than the small, is interesting; as plants with large seeds or fruit could hardly be transported by any other means; and Alph. de Candolle has shown that such plants generally have restricted ranges.|$|R
40|$|Court {{records of}} mental incompetency {{proceedings}} for {{a five-year period}} from a single county were analyzed to determine (1) the extent of actual involvement {{of the legal system}} in the cases, and (2) whether the adjudication was correlated with the legal variables and with two characteristics of the examining physicians. It was con-cluded that the legal system is only peripherally involved in incompetency cases and that the decisions, rather than being objective medical decisions, were correlated with a number of non-medical factors, including the legal variables and the amount of experience of the examining physicians in these types of cases. Involuntary commitment has wide ramifications for both the individual and the society. For the individual judged incompetent it includes incarcer-ation and stigma; for the society it in-volves judging and labelling individ-uals believed to be mentally ill, and thus can be instrumental in the stabili-zation of this type of deviant behavior. Incompetency proceedings are pres-ently structured to include both the legal and the medical institutions. How-ever, the values and assumptions of these two institutions relating to in-competency are generally in conflict. The legal profession is committed to the assumption that one is innocent until proven guilty; the medical pro-fession, on the other hand, seems to take the position that it is <b>safer</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> illness rather than its absence. The law is concerned with protecting individual rights; the medical profes-sion is concerned with providing proper treatment with as little trauma as pos-sible.
