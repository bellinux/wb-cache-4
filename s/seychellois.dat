25|$|The small Seychelles Coast Guard {{patrol boat}} Topaz engaged in another battle with pirates {{five days later}} on 30 March. While patrolling just {{off the coast of}} Somalia, Topaz {{encountered}} a captured dhow. After warning shots were fired, the dhow seemed to ignore the patrol boat and its occupants eventually opened up with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire. The <b>Seychellois</b> then engaged and after shooting off 10,000 rounds of machine gun fire, the dhow was burning and eventually sank. Twenty-seven members of the dhow's crew were rescued and the Topaz was returning to base when she was attacked by a trawler and two skiffs.

Pirate casualties are unknown and one member of the dhow's crew was wounded.|$|E
25|$|<b>Seychellois</b> {{society is}} {{essentially}} matriarchal.

25|$|<b>Seychellois</b> forces began firing in the {{direction}} of the Boeing, spreading worry among some of the mercenaries who saw the aircraft as their only means of escape.

After some negotiation, Saxena agreed to fly the them to Durban, South Africa.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} mercenaries was {{unknown to the}} <b>Seychellois,</b> as was the fact of whether the attack at the airport was {{supposed}} to coincide with a seaborne invasion. They subsequently set up a roadblock on {{the north end of}} the airport and mounted an unsuccessful attack on the Pointe La Rue Barracks in which one mercenary was wounded. <b>Seychellois</b> forces, with two armoured vehicles, occupied the airstrip, confining the putschists to the airport's buildings. They also fired upon the chartered aircraft, disabling it. One of the armoured vehicles made its way to the terminal forecourt, but the lights were out in the building and the driver had difficulty spotting the mercenaries. The vehicle's tires were quickly shot out and it was set ablaze by a Molotov cocktail. 2nd Lieutenant David Antat, the vehicle's commander, emerged from the top and engaged the mercenaries. They surrounded the vehicle and shot Antat several times in the chest, killing him.|$|E

25|$|Nine of Hoare's {{team were}} sent to the island of Mahé, Seychelles in advance. They were to {{identify}} potential targets and rally support from dissident <b>Seychellois</b> soldiers. The rest would arrive on a chartered Royal Swazi National Airways plane in the afternoon of 25 November 1981 disguised as vacationing rugby players and members of a charitable beer drinking club. They took the name of their beer club –Ye Ancient Order of Froth-Blowers (AOFB)– from a London society that had been defunct since the 1930s. As part of their cover, the mercenaries disguised as AOFB members filled their baggage with toys that were to be supposedly distributed to local orphanages. In reality, these were meant to conceal the weight of AK-47 rifles hidden under the false bottoms of each item of luggage. Hoare ensured that the toys were as bulky as possible to best suit the purpose.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Seychellois</b> President James Michel {{expressed}} his sincere condolences to the King of the Netherlands, government {{and people of}} the Netherlands as well to the Prime Minister of Malaysia and the Malaysian people while describing the attack as [...] "an incomprehensible human tragedy".|$|E
2500|$|A failed rescue {{operation}} {{was carried out}} by the Danish frigate [...] and a <b>Seychellois</b> Coast Guard patrol boat on 26 January. MV Beluga Nomination was taken over four days before and the attackers cut into the freighter's citadel with a blow torch to get at the crew. The Seychelles patrol boat and Esbern Snare were dispatched and when they found the pirates and engagement began. Boarding teams from the patrol boat were repulsed but the <b>Seychellois</b> were able to kill {{one or two of the}} pirates. Two of Beluga Nominations crew managed to escape in a lifeboat and were rescued by the Danish though four others were killed either by drowning or the pirates. Ultimately the operation was aborted and the pirates sailed away with the tanker and seven remaining hostages.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 November 1981, <b>Seychellois</b> {{security}} forces {{put down a}} coup attempt sponsored by South Africa. [...] "Mad Mike" [...] Hoare and 43 others posed {{as members of the}} [...] "Ancient Order of Froth Blowers", a defunct charitable beer-drinking fraternity, visiting the islands as tourists. Shortly after leaving their Royal Swazi National Airways aircraft, an airport security guard spotted a Kalashnikov assault rifle in their luggage; the discovery launched a gun battle in which hostages were taken. Most of the mercenaries escaped after hijacking another plane sitting on the runway.|$|E
2500|$|South African {{officials}} {{organized the}} coup under the code name [...] "Operation Angela". As plans developed, an internal struggle developed between the Defence Intelligence Division (SADF-ID) and the National Intelligence Service (NIS) over which agency {{would be responsible}} for the operation. In the end, SADF was charged with the plot but an NIS agent, Martin Dolinchek, was appointed to be a liaison officer with the task force. <b>Seychellois</b> exiles Gérard Hoarau, Paul Chow, and Edie Camille helped orchestrate the coup plot. Hoare determined that bringing in weapons via boat was, in spite of its effectiveness, too expensive a method to carry out.|$|E
2500|$|The putschists' {{plan was}} to arrive on Mahé, {{rendezvous}} with the advance team, and disperse around the island to various hotels. They were to wait for several days until René would be holding a cabinet meeting in the Maison du Peuple during which time they would launch their coup. They would seize the government, the airport, the radio station, police station, the army camp at Pointe La Rue, and other strategic locations. From the radio station they would broadcast that they had taken power on behalf of Mancham. The <b>Seychellois</b> exiles had assured the putschists {{that they would have}} the assistance of a 400-strong [...] "local resistance force", but none existed.|$|E
