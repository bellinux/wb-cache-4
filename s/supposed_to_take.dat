5|$|In July 1968, Nelson {{failed to}} appear for a planned meeting {{with an old}} friend. John DuBois, at whose house the meeting was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place, became worried and drove to Nelson's camp. When he {{surveyed}} the campsite, everything {{appeared to be in}} order, until he got to Nelson's chickee.|$|E
5|$|After {{the episode}} was submitted, several re-writes were requested. Originally, {{the story was}} <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place in Oklahoma, noted for being the center of Tornado Alley. For {{budgetary}} reasons, the episode was relocated to Mississippi. Another scene, originally scripted to take place at a motel, featured Pinker taking a short cut through a wall. This scene was cut {{not only because of}} budgetary reasons, but also because the writers and producers wanted to shift the episode from a supernatural focus to an emotional one.|$|E
5|$|A ten-man tag team {{match was}} <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place next, {{but it was}} {{canceled}} due to time constraints. The kayfabe reason given was that the heel team (Irwin R. Schyster, The Headshrinkers, Rick Martel and Jeff Jarrett) could not agree on {{who would be the}} team's captain for the match. Their opponents were scheduled to be the face team of the 1–2–3 Kid, Sparky Plugg, Tatanka and The Smoking Gunns. Bob Holly ("Sparky Plugg"), stated in his 2013 autobiography The Hardcore Truth that the timekeeper backstage repeatedly told the referee over his earpiece to end the ladder match, but Michaels and Ramon ignored him, and kept wrestling until officials were forced to cancel the tag team match.|$|E

5|$|At a {{congress}} in 1897 in Halle, the localists founded {{a national organization}} of their own, the Representatives' Centralization of Germany (Vertrauensmänner-Zentralisation Deutschlands). The congress was originally <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place a year earlier, but {{a lack of interest}} forced it to be postponed. There were 37 delegates at the congress representing 6,803 union members. Nearly two-thirds of the delegates came from Berlin or Halle. Almost half the delegates worked in the construction industry, while 14 delegates came from highly specialized professions. The congress decided to establish a five-person Business Commission seated in Berlin to organize political actions, aid in communication between local organizations, and raise financial support for strikes. Fritz Kater became the chairman of the commission. A newspaper, Solidarität (Solidarity), was founded, but the name was changed to Die Einigkeit (Unity) the following year. It initially appeared fortnightly, but was published on a weekly basis beginning in 1898.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} filmed over three {{days at the}} end of October and {{beginning}} of November 2002. It was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> only two days, but the filming of the wedding scenes was postponed after Messing got sick on the first day. On November 3, 2002, the rooftop terrace scene was filmed at the New York Palace Hotel. In November 2002, the scene in Central Park was shot in New York. The wedding ceremony was filmed, in part, at Temple Israel of Hollywood. As the actors performed their lines in front of a studio audience, the writing staff stood behind the cameras taking notes in the script and watching the audience's reaction to jokes. The writers often stopped the cameras and added new inflections to the dialog. According to the Knoxville News Sentinels Terry Morrow, the cast handled the changes quickly, and scenes were routinely redone up to three times even if the actors executed their lines properly.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for a}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship match at TNA's Hard Justice PPV event between A.J. Styles and Abyss. Styles won the match, thus earning his title shot against then-champion Jeff Jarrett at Hard Justice. TNA held the first-ever Lethal Lockdown match during the event. It pitted Team Nash (Diamond Dallas Page, Sean Waltman, and B.G. James) against Team Jarrett (Jeff Jarrett, Monty Brown, and The Outlaw), which Team Nash won. Kevin Nash was {{originally}} <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in the match but was removed due to sickness and was replaced with James. The TNA X Division Championship defense by Christopher Daniels against Elix Skipper was another highly promoted match for the event. Daniels won the bout and successfully retained the title. Jeff Hardy versus Raven in a Six Sides of Steel Tables match was featured on the card, which Hardy won.|$|E

5|$|Moe and Renee seem to form {{a strong}} relationship, but Moe is {{insecure}} about his hold on her and he feels he must spend {{large amounts of money}} so she will stay with him. Upon maxing out his credit card, Moe comes up with a scheme to commit insurance fraud by having Homer steal his car and park it on train tracks so it would be destroyed. The night the scheme is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place, Moe and Renee attend a police charity event aboard a yacht; the event's attendance by all the officers in town ensures Homer will not get caught perpetrating the scheme, and gives Moe an alibi so that no one will suspect he was behind the act. Homer botches the plan by stopping to watch a drive-in movie, while the train they were counting on to destroy Moe's car passes by. Deciding all is not lost, Homer drives the car over a cliff — but his attempt to exit the car before it sinks into the water below fails. The car ends up sinking just near the yacht where the police charity event is taking place, and when Homer swims to the surface, he is arrested.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2015–16 season, the Rockets {{acquired}} Ty Lawson {{from the}} Denver Nuggets {{in exchange for}} Joey Dorsey, Nick Johnson, Kostas Papanikolaou, Pablo Prigioni, and a 2016 first round draft pick. Expectations were high for the Rockets coming into the season. Lawson was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> some of the ball-handling pressures off of Harden, and they were bringing back nearly the same team that {{made it to the}} Western Conference Finals the previous year. However, things did not go according to plan. Kevin McHale was fired {{at the beginning of the}} season after the Rockets only won 4 of their first 11 games. J. B. Bickerstaff, his assistant, took over the head coaching duties. The Rockets struggled to remain in the playoff contention throughout the season due to inconsistent play and injuries. Lawson was waived mid-season in a buyout agreement. Houston only clinched the eight seed in the 2016 playoffs by beating the Kings in the last game of the regular season. In the first round of the playoffs, the Rockets played the Warriors, who were coming off a record-breaking regular season. The Rockets once again lost to the Warriors in 5 games.|$|E
