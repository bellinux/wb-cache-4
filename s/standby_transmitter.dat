It {{was also the first}} station to use entirely Australian-made broadcasting equipment from Amalgamated Wireless Australasia. The original transmission equipment consisted of a 10 kW and 2 kW <b>transmitter</b> (<b>standby)</b> which was based on the RCA product and adapted to 230V 50 Hz by AWA. The Melbourne pickup was a Rhode and Schwarz off air receiver with AWA return microwave links to the Studio. BCV-8 first went to air two weeks later, on 23 December 1961 (the same day as the launch of GMV-6 Shepparton), serving Bendigo and Central Victoria.|$|R
