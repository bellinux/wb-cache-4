50|$|The {{octagonal}} baptismal font is 15th {{century and}} {{stands on a}} square base. The sides of the basin have rectangular <b>sunk</b> <b>panels,</b> carved with the instruments of the Passion of Christ while round the stem are displayed angels holding shields. The font's wooden cover is Gothic of about the 18th century. The rood screen dates to the 15th century and has a carving of the Royal Arms on the cornice dating {{to the end of}} the 17th century. The altar and communion rails also date to the 17th century. The church has some 15th century bench ends with poppy heads together with some plain old seating. A few fragments of 15th century glass have been set in the nave windows.|$|E
5000|$|The Pevsner guide of 1992 {{says that}} [...] "Today Amble is a not {{unpleasant}} small town but has few buildings of distinction." [...] Of those, he records {{the church of}} St Cuthbert, which was originally constructed in 1870 and expanded in 1929, and its associated 1876-built vicarage. In addition, he notes some early Victorian terraces on Queen Street and North Street, as well as [...] "a fragment of wall with a C 15 window, square-headed and of two trefoiled lights with uncusped <b>sunk</b> <b>panels</b> above. Though it may seem unlikely, this is an in situ fragment of the medieval manor house. It belonged to Tynemouth Priory and may {{have served as a}} monastic cell." [...] This latter is found on High Street.|$|E
5000|$|The {{house was}} {{rendered}} by Soane using [...] "Parker's Roman Cement" [...] of biscuit-brown color. This {{was a new}} material, patented hydraulic lime render, of his time. The garden side of seven bays has a wooden veranda. In the center is a shallow pediment on pilaster strips with <b>sunk</b> <b>panels.</b> The entrance has a low center with a semicircular porch of Greek Doric columns of the Delos type. The end bays have {{on the ground floor}} arched windows with broad Grecian pediment over. Behind the porch is a square entrance hall once with a shallow dome. The window bars are painted dark grey, which causes the window detail to disappear so that pure shapes of openings are clearly visible appearing like punch recesses. Inside there is an all-cantilevered staircase with simple iron balustrade.|$|E
5000|$|The {{main arch}} {{is flanked by}} obelisks applied to the wall face bearing sculptural groups of trophies of arms. Above the main arch, the {{southern}} face carries a sculptural group by Michel Anguier of [...] "The Passage of the Rhine" [...] in a <b>sunk</b> <b>panel,</b> while the north face carries allegorical figures of the Rhine and the Netherlands. The entablature bears the gilded bronze inscription LUDOVICO MAGNO, [...] "To Louis the Great". Two smaller pedestrian walkways were built through the obelisk pedestals but they have now been closed.|$|R
2500|$|The north chapel was {{originally}} {{known as the}} Mayor's or Corporation Chapel because, until 1835, the Mayor was [...] "sworn in" [...] there. From 1677 onwards, the ceremony was performed without a sermon for in that year the Mayor and councillors took exception to being abused from the pulpit by the Vicar, Rev. Thomas Butler. The chapel's four-light east window has renewed 15th century tracery and glass of 1872. In the eastern jamb of {{the window in the}} north wall is a merchant's mark, a square <b>sunk</b> <b>panel</b> with a shield bearing a monogram – the sign of the Woolstaplers' Guild. Opposite the north door, there is a 13th-century piscina.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the front}} of the {{memorial}} are carved in bas-relief several palm branches, which lean to the left and shade the panel below. A laurel wreath lies atop the palm branches. The wreath has a bow at its base. One of the long, trailing ribbons of stone appears to be loosely draped over {{the right side of the}} panel, where it wraps around the base of the palm fronds. The other trailing ribbon appears to be loosely draped to the left of the panel. The wreath, fronds, and ribbon partially obscured the top, upper left corner, and upper right corner of the panel. Below the wreath and fronds is a <b>sunk</b> <b>panel</b> with inscription [...] "To Our Comrades".|$|R
50|$|The nave has a north arcade {{of three}} bays, the two eastern arches are semi-circular, of c. 1150, and {{supported}} on two circular columns with scalloped caps, the western arch with its respond was rebuilt in the 13th century. Above the two earlier arches are {{the remains of}} two blocked windows of c. 1100. The south arcade, also of three bays, is of the 15th century, with pointed arches and octagonal columns. The 15th-century clearstory has three two-light windows on each side. The roof is of 15th-century date, with <b>sunk</b> traceried <b>panels</b> in the braces.|$|R
2500|$|There is a Caen stone reredos by William Pashley, with [...] "sculptured panels under moulded and crocketted canopies, {{the walls}} {{on either side}} being enriched with traceried panels. The {{subjects}} being presented on the reredos, which is a beautiful work of art, are Bearing the Cross, the Crucifixion, and The Resurrection." [...] "The choir stalls and nave seats are of oak and have <b>sunk</b> traceried <b>panels</b> and foliated ends. The altar-rail, gas standards and rich scroll-work supporting the pulpit rail are of wrought brass. The aisles and chancel floors are paved with tiles in simple patterns." ...|$|R
2500|$|Two {{memorials}} to the Rough Riders were {{erected in}} Cuba {{shortly after the}} Spanish–American War ended. One, erected by Brigadier General Wood out of general funds provided for Cuba's military occupation, was erected next to the Spanish Army blockhouse atop San Juan Hill. This memorial stood on a square concrete base, on {{the four corners of}} which were placed artillery shells. A square plinth with <b>sunk,</b> blank <b>panels</b> on all four sides stood on the base. On the plinth rose a tapered square column with a flat top. Sunk into the face of this column was a bronze plaque, which read: [...] "In memory of the officers and men of the United States army, who were killed in the assault and capture of this ridge, July 1, 1898, and in the siege of Santiago, July 1 to July 16, 1898. War between Spain and the United States." ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of sunk costs, firm characteristics and spillovers from nearby exporters on a firm’s export participation decision. The empirical analysis involves the estimation of a non-structural, discrete choice, dynamic model with firm heterogeneity. The results suggest that both sunk costs and observable firm characteristics are important determinants of export market participation. In addition, previous history matters, in that, if a firm has been exporting the last period or the period before that it significantly {{increases the likelihood of}} the firm exporting in the current period. This conclusion is robust across all specifications. Also, larger firms with high capital intensity and foreign owned are more likely be exporters. Finally, while there is no clear evidence on export spillovers, if a firm operates in an export-oriented industry increases the likelihood of exporting.
