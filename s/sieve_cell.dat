50|$|The Pinaceae (pine family) are {{trees or}} shrubs, {{including}} {{many of the}} well-known conifers of commercial importance such as cedars, firs, hemlocks, larches, pines and spruces. The family {{is included in the}} order Pinales, formerly known as Coniferales. Pinaceae are supported as monophyletic by their protein-type <b>sieve</b> <b>cell</b> plastids, pattern of proembryogeny, and lack of bioflavonoids. They are the largest extant conifer family in species diversity, with between 220 and 250 species (depending on taxonomic opinion) in 11 genera, and the second-largest (after Cupressaceae) in geographical range, found in most of the Northern Hemisphere, with the majority of the species in temperate climates, but ranging from subarctic to tropical. The family often forms the dominant component of boreal, coastal, and montane forests. One species, Pinus merkusii, grows just south of the equator in Southeast Asia. Major centres of diversity are found in the mountains of southwest China, Mexico, central Japan, and California.|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} process of classification of granular materials using vibration screens is proposed by the authors. The objective of the modeling process is to describe the kinetics of extraction of granules sieved through upper and bottom sieves. The proposed model takes account of the pattern of diffusion and segregation of particles migrating through vibration screens. The model is based on the cell presentation of the process. The matrix of transition probabilities controls the particle distribution over each screen sieve. Sieved fractions are described separately, and successful sieving depends on the probability of a fraction to get through the <b>sieve</b> <b>cell</b> in the course of one sieving attempt. This probability depends on the ratio of the particle size to the <b>sieve</b> <b>cell</b> dimensions {{as well as on the}} screen oscillation parameters. The model may be used to calculate the kinetics of sieved fractions if the pre-set feed rate of particles, particles size distribution and velocity of their motion over the sieve surface are available.

40|$|Anatomical and {{developmental}} tissue relationships between Arceuthobium spp. endophytic tissues and host vascular tissues were examined by light and transmission electron microscopes. The host-parasite pairs studied were Psudotsuga menziesii/A. douglasii, Tsuga heterophylla/A. tsugense, Pinus sabiniana/A. occidentale, and P. lambertiana/A. californicum. The morphological form and growth characteristics of A. douglasii in different aged host tissues {{was found to}} be coordinated with growth and maturation of the host. It is proposed that morphological forms of Arceuthobium endophytic tissue be categorized as (1) primary, (2) diffuse-secondary, or (3) localized-secondary in order to semantically clarify the relationship of endophytic morphology with primary or secondary growth stages of host tissue. In localized-secondary endophytic forms, the parasite integrates with host rays to form multiseriate infected rays. At both the light and electron microscope level, parasite cells can usually be identified by their distinctive chromocentric nuclei and abundant lipid bodies or lipid ghosts. Sinker cells of Arceuthobium have unusual plastids which resemble etioplasts and which do not store starch. Sinker cells have distinctive mitochondria with unusually large nucleoid areas. They have abundant endoplasmic reticulum. Wall/plasmalemma specializations increase the membrane surface area in relation to cell volume in sinker cells. The walls of host and parasite are fused at the middle lamella common to both organisms and the organisms share a common apoplast. Pit-like regions in the fused walls of the host/parasite interface were commonly seen in light microscope studies, although such interspecific pitting is seen less than intraspecific pitting. It was determined that, whereas intraspecific pits are traversed by complete plasmodesmata, interspecific pits had no plasmatic channels, or, only half plasmodesmata on the host side of the pit. In one case a half plasmodesmata was seen on the Arceuthobium side of the host/parasite interface. On the basis of the electron microscope studies of the host/parasite interface it appears that plasmatic connections between host and parasite do not normally occur. Because of this plasmatic isolation it can be concluded that nutrient acquisition does not involve direct flow of nutrients via interspecific symplastic bridges. Therefore, photosynthate, normally housed within phloem cells, must be leaked into the common apoplast of both host and parasite before becoming available for absorption into the parasite symplast. Since host and parasite lack symplastic continuity but share a common apoplast, apoplastically-mobile herbicides should be tested for their ability to accumulate in parasite tissues. Cytopathological effects on the host cells were relatively mild although {{a significant increase in the}} ratio of radial to axillary vasculature was noted in infected tissue. Other modifications included a tendency for increased numbers of specialized phloem parenchyma (Strasburger cells) in infected rays. No apparent anomalies were observed in conjunction with host <b>sieve</b> <b>cell</b> structure and development. The structure and ontogeny of healthy P. sabiniana phloem was also studied. It was found that the sieve element reticulum (SER) of mature sieve cells is derived from plastids during the maturation of the <b>sieve</b> <b>cell.</b> After maturation some of the SER membranes seem to disassociate into individual 60 (ANGSTROM) fibrils. These fibrils then reassociate and appear to be condensed into paracrystalline bodies which, in turn, participate in the generation of new membranes in the mature <b>sieve</b> <b>cell.</b> Because of their plastid origin, the SER membranes may have energy transducing and ionic pump capabilities that commonly are associated with plastid membranes. Such specialized functions of SER may contribute to the translocating capacities of sieve cells...|$|E

Solutions are presented for steady state transport with specific mass transfer rates up to 1. 5 × 10 − 5 mole second− 1 centimeters− 2 (= 18. 5 grams hour− 1 centimeters− 2) over distances in excess of 50 meters. The calculations clearly indicate that a Münch pressure-flow system can operate over long distances provided (a) the sieve tube {{is surrounded by a}} semipermeable membrane; (b) sugars are actively loaded in one region and unloaded at another; (c) the sieve pores are unblocked so that the sieve tube hydraulic conductivity is high (around 4 centimeters 2 second− 1 bar− 1); (d) the sugar concentration is kept high (around one molar in the source region); and (e) the average sap velocity is kept low (around 20 - 50 centimeters hour− 1). The dimensions of sieve cells in several species of plants are reviewed and sieve tube hydraulic conductivities are calculated; the values range from 0. 2 to 20 centimeters 2 second− 1 bar− 1.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study changes in {{anatomical}} structure of phloem tissue in pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stems influenced by creeping forest fires of various rates. The experiments were {{carried out in the}} Lower Angara river region of the Angara provenance, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Central Siberia. The trees with green crowns and different fire damaged butts were chosen as models. Control (undamaged) trees were taken from stands adjacent to experimental plots. The changes of inner bark thickness, number of phloem annual layers between cambium and periderm and number of cells in conductive phloem were found in the stem side opposite to fire scars. The structure fluctuations of phloem tissue were detected: disturbances of <b>sieve</b> <b>cell</b> arrangement, phloem ray enlargements, resin canal overgrowth and formation of great resin ducts. The lignin accumulation was observed in inner bark and a large amount of callusing was detected between conductive and nonconductive phloem. Over the course of time, repairing of tissues occurred and the normal inner bark structure and chemistry (without lignin) were restored. The creeping fire of low intensity caused the maximal changes of phloem quantitative characteristics in trees with bark charring and these tendencies were stored after eight years. After creeping fire of high intensity the tendency for phloem thickening in trees with one fire scar and to thinning in strongly damaged trees were revealed. Also tendencies to decrease of the number of phloem annual layers, number of sieve cells in conductive phloem and ray frequency with increasing of stem injury degree were observed, besides axial parenchyma percentage trended to increase. Eight years after fire these tendencies were often not visible...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Pine needle blight of Pinus ponderosa Laws. {{caused by}} Elytroderma deformans (Weir) Darker is {{recognized}} {{by changes in}} the needles, in the bark and {{in the development of}} the branches. Anatomical studies of the host-parasite relation have been made previously on young pine tissue up to four years of age but not on older tissues. Neither has the pattern of invasion been worked out in individual plants. Permanent microsections using standard methods of micro-technique were made on material collected from Round Mountain and from the Pringle Falls Experimental Forest near Bend, Oregon. Normal bark development was studied in noninfected trees from age one through 25. Comparisons made with infected stems revealed: 1. Whereas deep periderms do not occur in uninfected stems up to 25 years old they do occur in infected stems anytime after the second year. The cork cambiums which arise within parenchyma cells of the primary and the secondary phloem in association with hyphal invasion of <b>sieve</b> <b>cells</b> ultimately produce pathological resin canals. Hyphal degeneration results and tissues external to the wound periderms become necrotic. These reactions are generalized responses such as any tissue makes to a foreign agent. However, there is no straight-line relationship between the intensity of tissue response and the severity of the invasion. Z. In stems, hyphae are confined entirely to the <b>sieve</b> <b>cells</b> of the phloem. They may spread vertically within a specified phloem layer and radially from one growth increment to the next. 3. When hyphae invade secondary phloem <b>sieve</b> <b>cells</b> close to the vascular cambium, the vascular cambium is stimulated to produce abnormal parenchyma cells. 4. Phloem horizontal resin canals are more abundant in infected than in noninfected tissue. 5. Sclereids occur in larger groups and more abundantly in both the cortex and the pith of infected stems. 6. Mycelia and microscopic anatomical changes may be present within stems which are macroscopically asymptomatic and bear. green needles. The distribution of hyphae within infected trees was determined by free-hand sections of suppressed ponderosa pine saplings up to 30 years old. Hyphae were found in stem tissue up to 20 -years-old.

The optimum permeability is large enough to permit substantial passive permeation into <b>sieve</b> <b>cells</b> in the source leaf and yet is small enough to permit phloem transport with some retention. The optimum permeability {{is a function of the}} velocity of sap flow in sieve tubes, the radius of the sieve tube, the over-all length of the plant, and the length of the carbohydrate and xenobiotic sources. It is argued that the nematicide, oxamyl, is near the optimum permeability under some experimental conditions.

The transient increase of callose deposition due to MP, however, occurs whether or not tendrils are dark adapted, and whether they receive light or are retained in the dark after MP. This indicates that if callose is directly involved in tendril coiling, then it exerts its effect on the sensory perception of the mechanical stimulus.

In xylem, hyphae grew in lumens of mature tracheids increasing resistance to the flow of xylem sap; bordered pit penetration facilitated intertracheal growth. Living host cells were never invaded by hyphae and evidence for the primary involvement of translocateabie phytotoxins was lacking.

50|$|Phloem loading is {{the process}} of loading carbon into the phloem for {{transport}} to different 'sinks' in a plant. Sinks include metabolism, growth, storage, and other processes or organs that need carbon solutes to persist. It can be a passive process, relying on a pressure gradient to generate diffusion of solutes through the symplast, or an active process, requiring energy to create membrane-bound transporter proteins that move solutes through the apoplast against a gradient. Passive phloem loading transports solutes freely through plasmodesma in the symplast of the minor veins of leaves. Active transport occurs apoplastically and does not use plasmodesmata. An intermediate type of loading exists that uses symplastic transport but utilizes a size-exclusion mechanism to ensure diffusion is a one-way process between the mesophyll and phloem cells. This process is referred to as polymer-trapping, in which simple solutes such as sucrose are synthesized into larger molecules such as stachyose or raffinose in intermediary cells. The larger molecules cannot diffuse back to the mesophyll but can move into the phloem's <b>sieve</b> <b>cells.</b> Therefore, the synthesis of larger compounds uses energy and is thus 'active' but this strategy does not require specialized proteins and can still move symplastically.|$|R
40|$|Cambial {{activity}} and the dynamics of xylem and phloem formation were monitored during the 2008 growth season in five chestnut (Castanea sativa) trees growing near Viterbo, Italy. The study was based on microscopic observations of micro-cores taken from stems at weekly intervals from mid-April until mid-October 2008. These observations allowed us to identify the timing of xylem and phloem formation. Cambial divisions, xylem and phloem formation had already started before the first sampling. By the end of April, the first earlywood vessels were already lignified and in early phloem the first formed <b>sieve</b> <b>cells</b> had finished postcambial growth. Formation of earlywood was completed {{by the end of}} May, which was about 2 – 3 weeks earlier than the completion of early phloem. The highest production of xylem cells was recorded between mid-May and mid-June and of phloem ones from mid-June until mid-July. Wood and phloem production mainly terminated in the middle of August while differentiation of xylem cells lasted until mid-October. The phloem ring was completed by the beginning of October 2008. Xylem growth rings were on average 2027 ± 635 μm wide and phloem rings 265 ± 68 μm. The proportion of latewood was 73 ± 8 % and of late-phloem 49 ± 11 %...|$|R
40|$|The ultra. {{structure}} of the different cell types in mature needles of pine (Pinus silvestris L.) is described. The epidermal cells are protoplasma-free with prominent secondary a~alls. The sunken guard cells have chloroplasts of a simple structure and many mitochondria. A hypodermal layer is formed by living vacuolated fiber cells. The mesophyll cells, which have tanniniferous vacuoles, are rich in chloroplasts and mitochondria and contain microbodies. The resin ducts have secretory cells with a unique kind of plastid, apparently engaged in resin production. The endodermal cells are characterized by strongly osmiophilic globules in the vacuoles. The transfusion tissue consists of thin-walled deformed traclzeids with bordered pits and parenchyma cells with tanniniferous vacuoles of different types. Like endodermal cells these parenchyma cells have simple anzocboid chloroplasts. Albun~inous cells with numerozts small tannin-free vacuoles and localized w~all thickenings traversed by bunches of plasmodesmuta are found on the outer side of each bundle. The adaxial xylem contains protoxylem rracheids with spiral wall thickenings and metasylem elements with evenly thickened walls. A f~tsiform cambium is inserted between the xylem and the phloem. The <b>sieve</b> <b>cells</b> have unique multilayered secondary walls. Plastids in these cells contain clusters of protein fibrils which become released into the protoplast.
