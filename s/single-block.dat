40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown {{the superiority of the}} optimistic {{protocols}} over the lock-based protocols for scheduling soft or firm real-time transactions. However, optimistic protocols cannot provide schedulability analysis for hard real-time transactions because of uncertain transaction restarts. In this paper, we develop new combined locking approach for using optimistic concurrency control to schedule hard real-time transactions. This approach can resolve serious conflicts, which cannot be resolved via dynamic adjustment of serialization order using timestamp intervals, and thus avoid transaction restarts. Furthermore, the combined locking approach can be integrated with the priority ceiling mechanism to achieve <b>single-blocking</b> and deadlock-free properties, and perform schedulability analysis for hard real-time transactions...|$|R
40|$|Many {{real-time}} database systems (RTDBS) {{are used}} to support mission-critical applications such as avionics control systems and defense systems, in which transactions have stringent real-time constraints. In these hard real-time systems, a transaction missing its deadline could lead to catastrophic consequences. The difficulties of providing a guarantee of meeting transaction deadlines in hard RTDBS lie in the problems of priority inversion and deadlocks. The transaction blocking delay due to priority inversion can be unbounded, which is unacceptable in most hard RTDBS. Several priority ceiling protocols have been proposed to solve these two problems. However, they are too conservative in scheduling transactions for the <b>single-blocking</b> and deadlock-free properties, leading to many unnecessary transaction blockings. The main reason for their conservatism is their implicit assumption that if a transaction's operation conflicts with that of another executing transaction, it is pre [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|While unpopular today, the key {{innovations}} of the T still dominate offensive football. The T was {{the first}} offense in which the quarterback took the snap from under center and then either handed off or dropped back to pass. Other offenses used the QB (usually called the [...] "blocking back") primarily as a blocker and the snap usually went to a halfback or tailback. The quarterback under center makes offenses very unpredictable since {{it is difficult to}} predict the play called based on formation alone. Second, the T allowed running backs to receive the hand-off from the quarterback and hit the [...] "hole" [...] at near full speed. This allowed more complex blocking schemes and gave offenses a temporary, but significant advantage. Other advantages offered by the T were: the ability of the QB to fake various handoffs (which led to [...] "option" [...] plays), plays developed much faster than with the single-wing, far fewer double-team blocks were required because the back hit the hole more quickly, the back could choose a different hole than originally planned (due to <b>single-blocking</b> across the line), the center was a more effective blocker because his head was up when he snapped the ball, and backs could be less versatile than required of single-wing backs. The use of the T Formation in Canada is slightly different because it is used in 12 man football. Another very popular variation is the Shotgun-T because it allows the quarterback to read the defense more effectively. It is very popular in high school football. It is rarely used in professional or college football. It is mostly used for sweeps. The T Formation is also being run out of the Pistol.|$|R

50|$|In 1912 {{they began}} to make {{aircraft}} engines introducing a series of engines that were not a commercial success. Coatalen seemed to believe the proper solution was a bespoke design for an aircraft designer's requirements instead of designing and producing a successful engine to let the aircraft designers build their aircraft around it. Sunbeam's designs included the troublesome V8 Sunbeam Arab, which was ordered in quantity in 1917 but suffered from continual vibration and reliability problems and only saw limited service and the more successful V12 Sunbeam Cossack. Meanwhile, Coatalen continued to experiment with ever-more odd designs such as the star-layout Sunbeam Malay, which never got beyond a prototype, the air-cooled Sunbeam Spartan and the diesel-powered Sunbeam Pathan. However Sunbeam was successful {{with the introduction of}} newer manufacturing techniques and {{became one of the first}} to build aluminium <b>single-block</b> engines, a design that would not become common until the 1930s.|$|E
5000|$|About {{the same}} time as Lusser was {{designing}} the P.1055, Kammhuber had started looking for an aircraft for his rapidly growing night fighter force. Heinkel quickly re-designed the P.1055 for this role as the P.1060. This design was similar in layout but somewhat smaller and powered by two of the largest displacement (at 44.5 litres/2,700 cu. in.) <b>single-block</b> liquid-cooled aviation engines placed in mass production in Germany, the DB 603 inverted V12 engine. As designed by Heinkel, these engines' nacelle accommodations featured annular radiators similar to the ones on the Jumo 211-powered Junkers Ju 88A, but considerably more streamlined in appearance, and which, after later refinement to their design, were likely to have been unitized as a Heinkel-specific Kraftei engine unit-packaging design. Nearly identical-appearance nacelles, complete with matching annular radiators, were also used on the four prototype He 177B prototype airframes built in 1943-44, and the six ordered prototypes of Heinkel's He 274 high-altitude strategic bombers with added turbochargers. The early DB 603 subtypes had poor altitude performance, which was a problem for Heinkel's short-winged design, but Daimler had a new [...] "G" [...] subtype of the DB 603 powerplant meant to produce 1,400 kW (1,900 PS) take-off power apiece under development to remedy the problem. Heinkel was sure he had a winner and sent the design off to the RLM in January 1942, while he funded the first prototype himself. The RLM again rejected the He 219, in favour of new Ju 88- and Me 210-based designs.|$|E

40|$|Nucleocytoplasmic {{transport}} {{is highly}} selective, efficient, and is regulated by a poorly understood mechanism involving hundreds of disordered FG nucleoporin proteins (FG nups) lining the inside {{wall of the}} nuclear pore complex (NPC). Previous research has concluded that FG nups in Baker's yeast (S. cerevisiae) are present in a bimodal distribution, with the "Forest Model" classifying FG nups as either di-block polymer like "trees" or <b>single-block</b> polymer like "shrubs". Using a combination of coarse-grained modeling and polymer brush modeling, {{the function of the}} di-block FG nups has previously been hypothesized in the Di-block Copolymer Brush Gate (DCBG) model to form a higher-order polymer brush architecture which can open and close to regulate transport across the NPC. In this manuscript we work to extend the original DCBG model by first performing coarse grained simulations of the <b>single-block</b> FG nups which confirm that they have a single block polymer structure rather than the di-block structure of tree nups. Our molecular simulations also demonstrate that these <b>single-block</b> FG nups are likely cohesive, compact, collapsed coil polymers, implying that these FG nups are generally localized to their grafting location within the NPC. We find that adding a layer of <b>single-block</b> FG nups to the DCBG model increases the range of cargo sizes which are able to translocate the pore through a cooperative effect involving <b>single-block</b> and di-block FG nups. This effect can explain the puzzling connection between <b>single-block</b> FG nup deletion mutants in S. cerevisiae and the resulting failure of certain large cargo transport through the NPC. Facilitation of large cargo transport via <b>single-block</b> and di-block FG nup cooperativity in the nuclear pore could provide a model mechanism for designing future biomimetic pores of greater applicability...|$|E
40|$|In 2010, Tao Xie and Dengguo Feng [XF 10] {{constructed}} the first <b>single-block</b> collision for MD 5 {{consisting of two}} 64 -byte messages that have the same MD 5 hash.

This paper answers that challenge by presenting a <b>single-block</b> collision attack based on other message differences together with an example colliding message pair. The attack is based on a new collision finding algorithm that exploits the low number of bitconditions in the first round. It uses a new way to choose message blocks that satisfy bitconditions up to step 22 and additionally uses three known tunnels to correct bitconditions up to step 25. The attack has an average runtime complexity equivalent to 2 49. 8 calls to MD 5 ’s compression function. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{implicit}} multigrid algorithm for {{the solution}} of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations has been implemented within the framework of multiple block-structured grids in which the physical domain is spatially decomposed into several blocks and the solution is advanced in parallel on each block. Utilities have been developed to implement such a scheme in a distributed computing environment. The multi-block algorithm is designed so that the explicit residual calculation is identical to that of <b>single-block</b> scheme, and therefore converged solutions for both schemes must be the same. To accelerate convergence, synchronous and asynchronous multigrid strategies are implemented.

40|$|Methods of {{multiblock}} bilinear factorizations {{have increased}} in popularity in chemistry and biology as recent increases in the availability of information-rich spectroscopic platforms has made collecting multiple spectroscopic observations per sample a practicable possibility.

While MB-PLS is a powerful extension to the nonlinear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS) framework, it still spreads predictive information across multiple components when response-uncorrelated variation exists in the data. The OnPLS extension to O 2 PLS provides a means of simultaneously extracting predictive and uncorrelated variation from a set of matrices, but is more suited to unsupervised data discovery than regression.

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a {{multiblock}} implementation of a general three-dimensional <b>single-block</b> computational fluid dynamics code, which is developed in a nonorthogonal, structured, collocated finite-volume grid system, and incorporates a range of turbulence models. The multiblock implementation is essentially block-unstructured, each block having its own local coordinate system unrelated to those of its neighbors. Any of the blocks may interface {{with more than one}} neighbor along any block face. Interblock communication is handled by inner-boundary connection information (receive and send point index arrays) and effected via two-layer dummy cells along interblock boundaries. This communication procedure is easy to extend to parallel computation. The implementation of the algorithm, which takes the advantage of Fortran 90, employs a method to keep most of the <b>single-block</b> code unchanged. Two cases are presented to validate the implementation, and another case with a block number ranging from 1 to 160 blocks is presented for test of the influence of the multiblocking on the convergence rate and execution time...|$|E

METHODS: Twenty-five patients underwent surgery from February 2000 to June 2008. Seventy-two {{percent of the patients}} were male, and the mean age was 29 years. RESULTS: The right side (56 %) and the medial condyle (92 %) were most affected. The lesions had an average area of 5. 28 cm², and the mean follow-up was 59 months. All of the variables other than instability showed significant improvements (p< 0. 05), as shown by the increase in the mean Lysholm score from 55 points preoperatively to 92 points (p< 0. 001) postoperatively. There was no loosening or collapse of the osteochondral graft. All of the patients had patellofemoral crepitation and pain for an average of six months.
