In <b>Speculative</b> <b>Security,</b> Marieke de Goede describes how previously unscrutinized practices such as donations and remittances, especially across national borders, {{have been affected by}} security measures that include datamining, asset freezing, and transnational regulation. These "precrime" measures focus on transactions that are perfectly legal but are thought to hold a specific potential to support terrorism. The pursuit of suspect monies is not simply an issue of financial regulation, she shows, but a broad political, social, and even cultural phenomenon with profound effects on everyday life. <b>Speculative</b> <b>Security</b> offers a range of examples that illustrate the types of security interventions employed today, including the extralegal targeting and breaking up of the al-Barakaat financial network that was accompanied by raids in the United States, asset freezes in Sweden, and the incarceration of a money remitter at Guantánamo Bay. De Goede develops the paradigm of "speculative security" as a way to understand the new fusing of finance and security, denoting the speculative nature of both the means and the ends of the war on terrorist financing.

40|$|Nearly 15 {{years after}} 9 / 11, {{it is time}} to grapple with the way in which imperatives of {{preemption}} have made their way into routine security practice and bureaucratic operations. As a growing literature in security studies and political geography has argued, preparing for catastrophe, expecting the worst, and scripting disasters are central elements of contemporary, <b>speculative</b> <b>security</b> culture. One of the most-discussed findings of the 9 / 11 Commission Report was that US security services had insufficiently deployed their imagination to foresee and preempt the attacks. This article introduces a special issue that offers a range of in-depth empirical studies that analyse how the imperative of ‘routinizing the imagination’ plays out in practice across different policy domains. It deploys the lens of performativity in order to conceptualize and explain the materialization of preemption and its situated entanglements with pre-existing security bureaucracies. We detail the idealized traits of a ‘security of the interstice’, which include interoperability, emergence, flexibility and analytical foresight that are meant to bridge the perceived gaps of security spaces and the temporal bridges between present and possible futures. The lofty rhetoric of preparing for the worst and bridging the gaps encounters numerous obstacles, challenges and reversals in practice. As becomes clear through the notion of performativity, such obstacles and challenges do not just ‘stand in the way’ of implementation, but actively shape the materialization of preemption in different sectors...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of bond-rating agencies on local autonomy is explored {{in light of}} recent research which views autonomy not as the degree of separation from the global economy, but rather as the nature of the interaction that places have with the wider politico-economic sphere. Based on the recent experience of American cities, it appears that the activities of rating agencies influence local autonomy more so now than during the immediate postwar period for three interrelated reasons. First, the governing turn away from federally-organized Keynesianism has transferred certain responsibilities to localities that are often funded with debt. Localities are thus more reliant on capital markets and the decisions that determine their access to such markets. Second, an increased presence of institutional investors in the municipal bond market has strengthened the investment-grade threshold because such investors are legally prohibited from holding a high percentage of <b>speculative</b> <b>securities.</b> Localities with speculative-grade debt are less able to sell their bonds than before. Third, commercial banks and locally-based lenders, which used to lend more frequently to cities (based on their own market research), are less involved in municipal debt markets than before. The knowledge vacuum created by their exit has been filled by the only other reputable sources on municipal credit: bond-rating agencies.

40|$|Working paperInterest rate {{sensitivity}} {{assessment framework}} based on fixed income yield indexes is developed {{and applied to}} two types of emerging market corporate debt: investment grade and high yield exposures. Our research advances beyond the correlation analyses focused on comovements in yields and/or spreads of risky and risk-free assets. We show that correlationbased analyses of interest rate sensitivity could appear rather inconclusive and, hence, we investigate the bottom line profit and loss of a hypothetical model portfolio of corporates. We consider historical data covering the period 2002 – 2015, which enable us to assess interest rate sensitivity of assets during the development, the apogee, and {{the aftermath of the}} global financial crisis. Based on empirical evidence, both for investment and <b>speculative</b> grades <b>securities,</b> we find that the emerging market corporates exhibit two different regimes of sensitivity to interest rate changes. We observe switching from a positive sensitivity under the normal market conditions to a negative one during distressed phases of business cycles. This research sheds light on how financial institutions may approach interest rate risk management, evidencing that even plain vanilla portfolios of emerging market corporates, which on average could appear rather insensitive to the interest rate risk in fact present a binary behavior of their interest rate sensitivities.

Nonetheless, inefficiencies of the market that distort market signals, constitute a barrier of the latter process. Therefore, the so-called “surplus drainage” from agriculture takes place.

Assuming that rural areas generate public goods (i. e. a landscape, a biodiversity, rural culture and tradition, unique food quality, food safety, food <b>security)</b> <b>speculative</b> land investors have lower willingness to contribute to its creation, than family farms. This is why agrarian policy levies more duties on them (institutional barriers) and favours farmers. The mentioned premises imply that the CAP’s subsidies should not be perceived as political rents according to its classical definition. Only a part of subsidies left after subtracting a value of “surplus drainage” and a compensation of public goods has a hallmark of the rent.

M&A industry in Vietnam has its socio-cultural traits that could help explain economic happenings, with anomalies and transitional characteristics, far better than even the most complete set of empirical data. Proceeds from sales of existing assets and firms have mainly flowed into the highly <b>speculative</b> industries of <b>securities,</b> banking, non-bank financials, portfolio investments and real estates. The impacts of M&A on Vietnam’s long-term prosperity are, thus, highly questionable. An observable high degree of volatility in the M&A processes would likely blow outthe high ex ante expectations by many speculators, when ex post realizations finally arrive. The effect of the past M&A evolution in Vietnam has been indecisively positive or negative, with significant presence of rent-seeking and likelihood of causing destructive entrepreneurship.

40|$|Commercial {{banks were}} leading {{participants}} in the U. S. securities markets during the great bull markets of the 19202 ̆ 7 s and the 19902 ̆ 7 s. Those stock market booms and the crashes that followed were extraordinary events. Is it merely a coincidence that the two most dramatic stock market booms and crashes in U. S. history occurred during periods when commercial banks played major roles in our securities markets? Or did the exercise of universal banking powers contribute to the financial and economic conditions that produced both episodes? This essay is the first installment of a larger project that seeks to answer these questions. This essay offers a preliminary assessment of {{the role played by}} universal banks in the economic boom-and-bust cycle of 1921 - 33. Part I reviews the reasons for Congress 2 ̆ 7 decision to prohibit universal banking in 1933. Senator Carter Glass and other proponents of the Glass-Steagall Act (GSA) maintained that banks and their <b>securities</b> affiliates encouraged <b>speculative</b> behavior and helped to promote unsustainable booms in the securities markets and the broader economy. Glass and his colleagues also contended that universal banking powers created conflicts of interest that prevented commercial banks from acting as impartial lenders or objective investment advisors. Part II examines the role of commercial banks during the economic boom of the 19202 ̆ 7 s. In response to a relaxation of legal rules governing bank powers, banks greatly expanded their financing of business firms and consumers through five channels - loans on securities, securities investments, public offerings of securities, real estate mortgages, and consumer credit. This surge of new financing enabled business firms and consumers to assume heavy debt burdens and to make risky investments that proved to be unviable when the U. S. economy entered a sharp recession in the summer of 1929. In addition, the entry of commercial banks into the securities markets created competitive pressures that caused commercial banks and traditional investment banks to abandon prudential standards and promote speculative domestic and foreign ventures. Commercial banks re-entered the securities markets during the 19902 ̆ 7 s as a result of court decisions and administrative rulings that opened loopholes in the GSA. In 1999, Congress enacted the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which effectively repealed the GSA and authorized the creation of financial holding companies. GLBA reflected a widely-shared view among modern scholars that the 1933 legislation was misguided from the outset. However, due to the bursting of the stock market bubble in 2000 and the revelation of scandals involving universal banks (e. g., Enron and WorldCom), some commentators have begun to reconsider the benefits and risks of universal banking. Part III of the essay offers a preliminary response to the modern scholarly critique of the GSA. First, contrary to the claims of some scholars, Congress did not adopt the 1933 legislation for the purpose of protecting investment banks from competition with commercial banks. Instead, Congress separated commercial and investment banking in order to prevent speculative booms and to ensure that banks acted impartially in making loans and providing investment advice. Second, there was substantial evidence for Congress 2 ̆ 7 belief that universal banks posed serious risks to the banking system. Universal banks undermined the soundness of smaller correspondent banks by encouraging them to purchase <b>speculative</b> <b>securities</b> during the 19202 ̆ 7 s. Losses on securities were a major cause of bank failures during the 19302 ̆ 7 s. In addition, several large universal banks failed between 1930 and 1933, due in part to risky investments and loans they made to support their own stock prices and to prop up affiliates. Those failures triggered regional banking panics and also contributed to the widespread loss of depositor confidence in the banking system. Third, modern scholars have attacked the conclusions reached by the Pecora investigation of 1933 - 34. However, earlier scholars concluded that the Pecora hearings produced credible evidence of conflicts of interest and other abuses involving universal banks during the 19202 ̆ 7 s. Given recent episodes of similar misconduct by universal banks during the 19902 ̆ 7 s, {{further research is needed to}} evaluate the risks created by universal banks during both periods...|$|R

40|$|This study {{provides}} an overview of federal debt – its history, its composition, its management, its economic uses, and a discussion of recent trends. The Continental Congress began issuing debt securities in 1776, and the United States has had outstanding debt ever since. The first Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton established sound goals and principles for debt management that transformed U. S. government debt from highly <b>speculative</b> and illiquid <b>securities</b> into the world’s safest and most liquid investment. Because of Hamilton’s visionary leadership, Treasuries developed a unique set of characteristics – default risk-free, a seamless yield curve, high liquidity, a deeply integrated market, and extremely low bid-ask spreads – that let Treasuries perform many economic functions other than financing past federal budget deficits. For example, the Federal Reserve uses Treasuries to conduct U. S. monetary policy. Foreign central banks hold Treasuries as a store of value and a means to intervene in foreign exchange markets. Treasuries are the premier “safe haven ” investment during economic turbulence. Wall Street uses the Treasury yield curve as the default risk-free pricing benchmark, while Washington indexes its loans to students and farmers to Treasury yields. Treasuries collateralize approximately four-fifths of the transactions in the $ 2. 5 trillion a day repurchase agreement (repo) market. Portfolio managers employ Treasuries for interest rate hedging or speculation and for improving risk-return trade-off in their portfolios.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three empirical essays in financial economics that explore the role financial regulation can play in firm, household, and investor decision making. In the first chapter for households with homes worth less than the mortgage I test the effect of "household debt overhang" on their labor supply decisions. I utilize a new transaction-level dataset with comprehensive information on assets, liabilities, and deposits for all customers of a major U. S. financial institution from 2010 - 2014. I then exploit plausibly exogenous variation in the timing of home purchases among households in the same region and time as an instrument for the probability of negative home equity and find that negative equity causes a 2 %- 6 % reduction in household labor supply. These results are robust to the inclusion of time-varying national cohort fixed effects as well as using a life-event driven proxy for the timing of home purchase based on the date of college attendance. Income-contingent loss mitigation creates implicit marginal tax rates that provide a plausible channel by which household debt overhang acts. Consistent with this explanation I find that the labor supply decline is larger in regions where mortgage modifications are more prevalent, even if foreclosures occur less frequently. Taken together these results provide evidence that the moral hazard problem caused by mortgage debt overhang can exacerbate employment declines and highlights the potential unintended consequences of mortgage assistance programs. In the second chapter I investigate whether restrictions on bank speculation can be costly for non-financial firms by examining the unexpected inception of federal rating-contingent investment restrictions in 1936 preventing banks from purchasing <b>speculative</b> grade <b>securities.</b> Immediately following the ruling I find a persistent 3 - 5 % equity value decline for firms requiring speculative financing, concentrated in industries reliant on external financing, but no change in bond yields. Rather than face increases in default risk or direct interest costs these firms reduce debt issuances to improve ratings, leading to reduced investment and asset growth {{in the years following}} the ruling. In the third chapter (co-authored with Eric Hughson and Marc Weidenmier) we explore the role clearinghouses play in global financial stability. Empirical identification of the effect of centralized clearing on counterparty risk is challenging because of the co-incidence of macro-economic turbulence and the introduction of clearinghouses. We overcome these concerns by examining a novel historical experiment, the establishment of a clearinghouse on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1892. During this period the largest NYSE stocks were also listed on the Consolidated Stock Exchange (CSE), which already had a clearinghouse. Using identical securities on the CSE as a control, we find that the introduction of clearing reduced annualized volatility of NYSE returns by 90 - 173 bps and increased asset values. Prior to clearing, shocks to overnight lending rates reduced the value of stocks on the NYSE, relative to identical stocks on the CSE, but this was no longer true after the establishment of clearing. We also show that at least V 2 of the average reduction in counterparty risk on the NYSE is driven by a reduction in contagion risk - the risk of a cascade of broker defaults. Our results indicate that clearing can cause a significant improvement in market stability and value through a reduction in network contagion and counterparty risk. Chapter 1.
