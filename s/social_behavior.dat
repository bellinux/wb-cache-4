40|$|Graduation date: 2000 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the general nature of {{attributions}} of Chinese parents in the U.

The attributions were examined along three causal dimensions: locus of causality (internal versus external), stability (stable versus unstable), and controllability (controllable versus uncontrollable). The types of child <b>social</b> <b>behaviors</b> studied were positive <b>social</b> <b>behaviors,</b> aggression, and withdrawal. The study looked at the contributions of child age, child gender, parent gender, and parent adaptation to life in the U. S. to parental attributions. It also investigated whether different types of child <b>social</b> <b>behaviors</b> (i. e., positive, aggressive, and withdrawn behaviors) elicited different types of attributions from parents. Results indicated that older children's <b>social</b> <b>behaviors</b> elicited similar attributions from Chinese parents as younger children's. Chinese parents saw girls' withdrawn behaviors as more internally caused and controllable, but not more stable, than boys' withdrawn behaviors. However, no difference was found between boys' and girls' aggressive or positive <b>social</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Chinese parents saw their children's positive <b>social</b> <b>behaviors</b> as more internally caused, stable and controllable than their children's negative social (aggressive and withdrawn) behaviors. In addition, Chinese parents saw their children's withdrawn behaviors as more internally caused, but not more stable or controllable, than their children's aggressive behaviors. Fathers and mothers were not significantly different in their attributions for their children's <b>social</b> <b>behaviors.</b> No parent gender effect was found. Chinese parents who were more adapted to life in the U.

In addition, these more highly adapted Chinese parents saw their children's aggressive behaviors as more unstable and uncontrollable by their children, but not more external, than Chinese parents less adapted. Furthermore, more highly adapted Chinese parents saw their children's withdrawn behaviors as more externally caused and less controllable, but not more unstable, than Chinese parents less adapted...|$|R

5|$|A few spider {{species that}} build webs live {{together}} in large colonies and show <b>social</b> <b>behavior,</b> although not as complex as in social insects. Anelosimus eximius (in the family Theridiidae) can form colonies of up to 50,000 individuals. The genus Anelosimus has a strong tendency towards sociality: all known American species are social, and species in Madagascar are at least somewhat social. Members of other species {{in the same family}} but several different genera have independently developed <b>social</b> <b>behavior.</b> For example, although Theridion nigroannulatum belongs to a genus with no other social species, T. nigroannulatum build colonies that may contain several thousand individuals that co-operate in prey capture and share food. Other communal spiders include several Philoponella species (family Uloboridae), Agelena consociata (family Agelenidae) and Mallos gregalis (family Dictynidae). Social predatory spiders need to defend their prey against kleptoparasites ("thieves"), and larger colonies are more successful in this. The herbivorous spider Bagheera kiplingi lives in small colonies which help to protect eggs and spiderlings. Even widow spiders (genus Latrodectus), which are notoriously cannibalistic, have formed small colonies in captivity, sharing webs and feeding together.|$|E
5|$|As an apex predator, Daspletosaurus {{was at the}} top of {{the food}} chain, {{probably}} preying on large dinosaurs like the ceratopsid Centrosaurus and the hadrosaur Hypacrosaurus. In some areas, Daspletosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Gorgosaurus, though there is some evidence of niche differentiation between the two. While Daspletosaurus fossils are rarer than other tyrannosaurids', the available specimens allow some analysis of the biology of these animals, including <b>social</b> <b>behavior,</b> diet and life history.|$|E

Some paleontologists interpret Allosaurus as having had cooperative <b>social</b> <b>behavior,</b> and hunting in packs, while others believe individuals may have been aggressive toward each other, and that congregations of this genus are the result of lone individuals feeding on the same carcasses.

We have used the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus as a model system for studying the evolution of social interactions.

Based on his analysis of the MSA bovid assemblage at Klasies, Milo reports MSA people were formidable hunters and that their <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> patterns approached those of modern humans. Deacon maintains that the management of plant food resources through deliberate burning of the veld to encourage the growth of plants with corms or tubers in the southern Cape during the Howiesons Poort (c. 70–55 ka) is indicative of modern human behavior. A family basis to foraging groups, color symbolism and the reciprocal exchange of artifacts and the formal organization of living space are, he suggests, further evidence for modernity in the MSA.|$|E

5|$|Cranial display features, {{such as the}} one {{possessed by}} Cryolophosaurus, make sense in social, gregarious animals, where other members of the species are {{available}} to observe and interpret messages of sexual status. Kevin Padian et al. (2004) challenged conventional hypotheses that the purpose of bizarre cranial structures and post-cranial armor in dinosaurs, was either for attracting mates, intimidating/fighting rivals in the group, or intimidating potential predators of other species. Padian et al. noted that based on phylogenetic, histological, and functional evidence these bizarre structures {{can be explained by the}} phenomenon of intra-species recognition, which is supported by the fossil evidence. Thomas R. Holtz Jr. (2010) found that the bizarre crest of Cryolophosaurus was primarily for intra-species recognition, based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture. According to Thomas Rich and his colleagues, the crest would have been ineffective as a weapon and may have possibly functioned as a display feature during certain types of <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> such as mating.|$|E
5|$|Male spiders {{identify}} themselves {{by a variety}} of complex courtship rituals to avoid being eaten by the females. Males of most species survive a few matings, limited mainly by their short life spans. Females weave silk egg-cases, each of which may contain hundreds of eggs. Females of many species care for their young, for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them. A minority of species are social, building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals. <b>Social</b> <b>behavior</b> ranges from precarious toleration, as in the widow spiders, to co-operative hunting and food-sharing.

5|$|Remains of Deinonychus, {{a closely}} related dromaeosaurid, have {{commonly}} {{been found in}} aggregations of several individuals.

The only solid evidence for <b>social</b> <b>behavior</b> among dromaeosaurids comes from a Chinese trackway of fossil footprints, which shows six individuals of a large species moving as a group, though no evidence of cooperative hunting was found. Although many isolated fossils of Velociraptor have been found in Mongolia, none were closely associated with any other individuals. Therefore, while Velociraptor is commonly depicted as a pack hunter, as in Jurassic Park, there is only limited fossil evidence to support this theory for dromaeosaurids in general, and none specific to Velociraptor itself. The pack hunting theory was based on a discovery of several specimens of Deinonychus found around the remains of a Tenontosaurus. No other group of dromaeosaurids has been found in close association.|$|E

40|$|The {{propensity}} to exhibit <b>social</b> <b>behaviors</b> during interactions with same-sex and opposite-sex conspecifics is modulated by various neurotransmitters, including dopamine. Dopamine is a conserved neurotransmitter among vertebrates and dopaminergic receptors are also highly conserved among taxa. Activation of D 1 and D 2 dopamine receptor subtypes {{has been shown}} to modulate <b>social</b> <b>behaviors,</b> especially in mammalian and avian studies. However, the specific behavioral functions of these receptors vary across taxa. In reptiles there have been few studies examining the relationship between dopaminergic receptors and <b>social</b> <b>behaviors.</b> We therefore examined the effects of D 1 and D 2 agonists and antagonists on sexual and aggressive behaviors in the male green anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis). Treatment with high doses of both D 1 and D 2 agonists was found to impair both sexual and aggressive behaviors. However, the D 1 agonist treatment was also found to impair motor function, suggesting that those effects were likely nonspecific. Lower doses of both agonists and antagonists failed to affect <b>social</b> <b>behaviors.</b> These findings provide some evidence for D 2 receptor regulation of <b>social</b> <b>behaviors,</b> but in contrast with previous research, these effects are all inhibitory and no effects were found for manipulations of D 1 receptors. A potential reason for the lack of more widespread effects on <b>social</b> <b>behaviors</b> using moderate or low drug doses is that systemic injection of drugs resulted in effects throughout the whole brain, thus affecting counteracting circuits which negated one another, making measurable changes in behavioral output difficult to detect.
