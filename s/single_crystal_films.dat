40|$|Solid-state {{dewetting}} of {{thin films}} {{is a process}} through which continuous solid films agglomerate to form islands. This process is driven by capillary forces, often occurring via surface self-diffusion. Solid-state dewetting of <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>films</b> {{has the potential to}} produce a wide range of regular structures because it occurs in ways controlled by crystallographic symmetries in <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>films.</b> We demonstrate this potential by pursuing two major objectives: understanding the underlying physics of regular morphological evolution during dewetting of <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>films,</b> and guiding the phenomenon to reproducibly produce regular structures with various morphologies. We used single crystal Ni films grown on single crystal MgO substrates as a model system. Dewetting initiates with the nucleation of holes and proceeds through the retraction of film edges around holes. By analyzing the anisotropy of the edge retraction rate and facet morphologies, we show that the effect of the anisotropy of surface energy and surface diffusion on early-stage dewetting morphologies strongly depends on the initial film orientation and annealing ambient. A series of instabilities increases the complexity of morphological evolution in the latter stages of dewetting. These include inplane faceting of retracting edges, accelerated growth at concave corners, edge drag at convex corners, edge pinch-off, and Rayleigh-like instabilities. Clear identification of these instabilities leads to improved understandings of the kinetic mechanisms that govern the formation of complex dewetting morphologies. We also demonstrate that solid-state dewetting can be used to produce regular structures with specific shapes via dewetting of patches patterned from <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>films.</b> Initial patches were systematically designed {{on the basis of the}} dewetting mechanisms to form a variety of specific morphologies. Morphological evolution of these patches occurs in more deterministic ways because of geometric constraints, and leads to the formation of regular structures with smaller sizes and more complex shapes than the initial patches. by Jongpil Ye.

40|$|Theoretical and {{computational}} {{methods have}} been used to study nonlinear effects in the mechanical response of materials at the nano and macro scales. These methods include, acoustoelastic theory, molecular dynamics and finite element models. The nonlinear indentation response of Ni thin films of thicknesses in the nano scale was studied using molecular dynamics simulations with embedded atom method (EAM) interatomic potentials. The study included both <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>films</b> and films containing low angle grain boundaries perpendicular to the film surface. The simulation results for <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>films</b> show that as film thickness decreases, larger forces are required for similar indentation depths but the contact stress necessary to emit the first dislocation under the indenter is nearly independent of film thickness. The presence of grain boundaries in the films leads to the emission of dislocations at a lower applied stress. For a single crystal Ni thin film of a thickness of 20 nm a direct comparison of simulation and experimental results is presented, showing excellent agreement in hardness values. The effects of using different interatomic potentials and indentation rates for the simulations are also discussed. Dynamic indentation of the Ni thin film was also carried out fo...|$|E
40|$|In the {{as-deposited}} state, {{thin films}} are generally far from equilibrium and will agglomerate or dewet to form arrays of islands when sufficient atomic motion is allowed. Dewetting can occur {{well below the}} films' melting temperature in the solid-state. The dewetting process begins by formation and motion of film-substrate-vapor three-phase boundaries. These film edges retract via capillarity-driven mass transport. In the absence of film or substrate patterning, the dewetting morphology of polycrystalline films is not well ordered. However, dewetting in <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>films</b> leads to a much more regular morphology, due to surface and interfacial energy anisotropy and surface self-diffusivity anisotropy. When dewetting of such films is templated by pre-patterning, dewetting patterns {{much smaller than the}} original template patterns can be generated. This makes templated dewetting a potential self-assembly method for generation of complex structures with sub-lithographic length scales. However, control of such patterns in <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>films</b> requires a significant degree of quantitative understanding of anisotropic dewetting in the solid-state. As a starting point for quantitative research on solid-state dewetting of <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>films,</b> dewetting of thin <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>films</b> that were pre-patterned to have edges with specific in-plane orientations were quantitatively characterized and their observed behavior was modeled. Edges aligned to specific crystallographic orientations remain straight as they retract, while edges with other crystallographic orientations develop in-plane facets composed of kinetically stable edges. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of the retraction of kinetically stable edges can {{serve as the basis for}} understanding the retraction of edges with all other orientations. Measurements of the rates of retraction of kinetically stable edges for single crystal (100) and (110) Ni films on single crystal MgO are reported. In cross section, the retracting edges develop out-of-plane facets that are generally consistent with the facets expected from the equilibrium Wulff shape. To capture the observed anisotropic character of the edge retraction rate, capillarity-driven edge retraction through atomic surface self-diffusion was modeled in 2 dimensions using the crystalline formulation method developed by Carter and coworkers. The model and experiments show a similar time scaling for the edge retraction distance. Also, the magnitudes of the predicted retraction rates are consistent with the specific observed retraction rate anisotropy given the large range of error in parameters used in the model. Other possible sources of error include the fact that actual edges are not fully facetted and are sometimes bound by non-equilibrium facets. by Gye Hyun Kim. Thesis (S. M.)
