In a room {{containing}} controllable {{lights and}} <b>sun</b> <b>blinds</b> {{as well as}} brightness sensors, the Evolutionary Platform for Intelligent Cooperation spec-ifies a distributed evolutionary approach to adjust the light and <b>sun</b> <b>blind</b> configu-ration. It automatically adapts to sensors and actuators going on or off, changing requirements, and unexpected changes of external actuators. This paper demon-strates the flexibility of EPIC by several simulated runs in a virtual smartroom environment. ...|$|R
40|$|DE 10231139 C UPAB: 20031030 NOVELTY - The <b>sun</b> <b>blind,</b> {{composed}} {{of a number of}} parallel slats (L) which can rotate around their longitudinal axes, are each fitted with a number of compound parabolic concentrators (CPC) (1) on their upper sides (LO). The CPCs are of a dielectric material with an exposed side towards the light, and a receiver side aligned at the slat surface. The upper side of each slit is at least partially curved or angled across its longitudinal axis, with a reflective or opaque surface. The CPCs lie directly on the slat surfaces, or are held by a reflecting or transparent intermediate adhesive layer. USE - The <b>sun</b> <b>blind</b> is especially for mounting between the glass panes of a double glazing installation. ADVANTAGE - The slats of the <b>sun</b> <b>blind</b> effectively reflect incoming light to shade the interior behind it...|$|R

50|$|A new extension, {{dating from}} 1967, {{consists}} of two low detached blocks and a seven story block, and a detached restaurant.

50|$|Perforated {{films were}} sold in the 1970s and 1980s as <b>sun</b> <b>blinds</b> for {{vehicles}} and buildings. This was cited in the first patent application for see-through graphics. The blinds had brightly colored and reflective front sides. The reverse side was a non-reflective black color which allowed good visibility through the blind.|$|R
50|$|From 1971 the {{interior}} was simplified to cut maintenance costs, with some doorway windows being replaced by metal and plywood, and the wooden latticed <b>sun</b> <b>blinds</b> being removed. The motor bogies on the trains were originally of pressed steel construction, being changed for a new design in cast steel in the 1930s.|$|R

50|$|Although the Eurotram’s {{design has}} {{generally}} been applauded for its user-friendliness, it has also received some criticism. For instance, the doors have been criticised for being too slow to open/close (they are single doors), lengthening the time spent in stations. Additionally, the large window over and around the driver’s cabin can result in the cabin becoming too hot, a problem that was remedied with <b>sun</b> <b>blinds.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Rover 200 Coupé was {{equipped}} with a specially shaped split glass roof system with a central T-Bar. The twin panels could be tilted or detached independently, and the bar itself could also be removed and stored in the boot in a special protective cover. The glass was an advanced, semi reflective material, coated with titanium. Transmission of solar heat was restricted to only six per cent, {{eliminating the need for}} a <b>sun</b> <b>blind.</b>|$|R

5000|$|There {{were three}} {{significant}} models {{on the same}} chassis, a 4-door six-light saloon, a 4-door tourer and a 2-door 4-seat tourer known as the Southern Cross. The front doors on the saloon were hinged at the front, while those at the back were hinged to the rear. A <b>sliding</b> <b>sun</b> roof was standard, operated by a rotating handle above the driver. Folding rear arm rests were fitted but do not appear on the prototype. The most noticeable differences between 1931 cars and the later models was a change to the radiator surround and different profiling of the front wings.|$|R

A six-way power seat was a new option, as was [...] "Speedminder", for the driver to set a needle at a specific speed and a buzzer would sound if the pre-set was exceeded.|$|R
50|$|Car glass {{includes}} windscreens, {{side and}} rear windows, and glass panel roofs on a vehicle. Side windows {{can be either}} fixed or be raised and lowered by depressing a button (power window) or switch or using a hand-turned crank. The power moonroof, a transparent, retractable sunroof, may be considered {{as an extension of}} the power window concept. Some vehicles include <b>sun</b> <b>blinds</b> for rear and rear side windows. The window shield of a car is appropriate for safety and protection of debri in the road. It also comforts the driver as well. The majority of car glass is held in place by glass run channels, which also serve to contain any fragments of glass if the glass breaks.|$|R

40|$|She {{leaned across}} the picnic hamper, {{reaching}} out for my hearing aid in my open-palmed hand. I leaned back, batting her hand away from mine. The glare of the summer <b>sun</b> <b>blinded</b> me and I struck empty air. She was quick. Her tendril-fingers seized the beige seashell curve of my hearing aid and she lifted the cargo of sound towards her eyes. She peered at the empty battery-cage, flicking it open and shut {{as if it was}} a cigarette lighter, as if she could spark hearing-life into this trick of plastic and metal that held no meaning outside of my ear. I shouted, 'Don't do that!' Clenching my fist around the new battery I had been about to insert into my hearing aid, I imagined it speeding like a bullet towards her heart.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{is presented to}} determine the wind loads on external solar blinds on two 60 m high towers. This investigation was performed some years after {{the construction of the}} towers, with the <b>sun</b> <b>blinds</b> in place. A combination of wind tunnel tests and full scale measurements was done. The shape of the towers, and the unique design of the solar blinds, make that this design is not covered in any wind loading code. However, during the design stage, a simplified approach was adopted to construct the solar blinds and its load bearing structure. During operation of the building, damage occurred to some of the hangers of the structure and doubts were raised whether the wind loads on the external blinds were properly estimated. The results of the current investigation are being used for a re-analysis of the structure, and may lead to replacement of parts of the structure...|$|R
5000|$|The steel bodied 202 was {{instantly}} recognisable as a Peugeot {{from the way}} that the headlights were set, as on the older 302, close together, in a protected location behind the front grille. Most customers chose the four-door berline (saloon) version which by 1948 came with a steel-panel <b>sliding</b> <b>sun</b> roof included in the price. However the boot/trunk was small and could be accessed only from within the car, there being no outside boot lid. The two-seater two-door cabriolet [...] "décapotable" [...] did have a separate boot lid but cost approximately 30% more than the berline. Priced very closely to the berline was a structurally similar four-door four-seater [...] "berline découvrable", which featured a full fold away hood: this type of body would become difficult to provide using the monocoque body structure then becoming mainstream and which would be a feature of the Peugeot 203. Both the Peugeot 202 and the Peugeot 203 had frontal suicide doors.|$|R
