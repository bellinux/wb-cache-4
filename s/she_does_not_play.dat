Castillo was awarded Best Digger, Receiver and Libero. Nonetheless, she expressed that <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>play</b> for the awards, that they come for the strength invested for playing for her native country, and that playing at home brings an extra motivation.|$|E
500|$|<b>She</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>play</b> {{for a state}} team. [...] Rather, she is {{coached by}} Australian Paralympic Committee (APC) Development Coordinator and {{athletics}} coach Cathy Lambert. Having not even heard of goalball a few months before, Henderson took up the sport in 2010 following an invitation to attend a team training camp. She made the national team in January 2011 at the national trials, and her national team debut in 2011 at the IBSA Goalball World Cup, where her team finished sixth, and she scored four total goals. Her team made it the quarter finals before losing to Russia 3–6. It then met the Spain women's national goalball team to try to earn {{a spot in the}} fifth/sixth place match, where Australia walked away 8–7 victors. [...] In the fifth/sixth [...] place match, it lost to the Israel women's national goalball team 6–8. She played in the 2011 African-Oceania regional Paralympic qualifying competition and in its gold medal game against the New Zealand women's national goalball team, which Australia won.|$|E
2500|$|By 2014, Louisa Thomas of Grantland {{was writing}} with admiration that [...] "it {{turns out that}} [...] is astonishingly fast. She started to think ahead during points [...] she has uncanny anticipation. She became even faster [...] her strokes became more simple: compact, beautiful, unreadable. [...] she learned to disrupt the opposition's rhythm and {{disguise}} her own. At her best, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>play</b> in patterns. She hits with surprising power. She covers the whole court. She hits balls with heavy power without making a sound. [...] Like Djokovic she has a talent for hitting winners from defensive positions. She is a defensive aggressor, an aggressive defender. She is becoming unclassifiable." [...] After Halep finished runner-up in her first Grand Slam final against powerful hitter Maria Sharapova in Roland Garros in 2014, Eleanor Crooks of The Independent wrote that Halep [...] "has a lovely fluidity of movement and superb balance that enables her to comfortably trade with more powerful players". Michael Beattie of Wimbledon.org also noticed that [...] "is free of the shrieks, tics and fist-pumps of her contemporaries." ...|$|E

50|$|Gutiérrez {{is known}} for making films with a low budget.

Other {{than the fact that}} its location was New York, she managed to keep costs down in her first film Sublet (1992) by shooting indoors. Sexo Oral (1994) {{is said to be the}} cheapest Spanish film ever made. She kept its costs down by interviewing non-professional actors, and not hiring many professional actors.|$|E
50|$|The final {{implications}} of this story are social. It reveals the social aspect of ma’at: harmony “between and amongst gods and human beings” (Vinson 47-48). “The Blinding of Truth by Falsehood” also illuminates {{the role of women}} at this point in Egyptian history. There seemed to be negativity towards the influential roles women played in the previous dynasty, and it manifests itself in this piece (Lesko 102). Ma’at, a female concept, is made male (Baines 374). The woman in the tale only exists to desire Truth and conceive his son; <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>play</b> a major part (Vinson 47). This is {{in stark contrast to the}} major role the goddess Isis plays in the original Osiris myth (Griffiths 90).|$|E
50|$|Yum Yum {{does not}} appear to have any {{extraordinary}} abilities, so <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>play</b> as active a role in solving the mysteries, but is still a major character in the series. She is also Siamese, and had a troubled past. Her history is fully explained in The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern, but it can be summed up rather briefly. Qwilleran got Yum Yum as a kitten from the Taits, rich folk who did not treat Yum Yum properly and did not even truly decide on her name. Mr. Tait, a jade collector, named her Yu after a variety of jade, while Mrs. Tait, whose family originates from Aarhus, Denmark calls her Freya, after the Norse goddess of love.|$|E

5000|$|In poker tournament play, blinds serve a dual purpose. In {{addition}} to the purpose explained above, blinds are also used to control how long the tournament will last. Before the tournament begins, the players will agree to a blinds structure, usually set by the tournament organizer. This structure defines how long each round is and how much the blinds increase per round. Typically, they are increased at a smooth rate of between 25% and 50% per round over the previous round. As the blinds increase, players need to increase their chip counts (or [...] "stacks") {{to stay in the}} game. The blinds will eventually consume all of a player's stack if he or <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>play</b> to win more.|$|E
50|$|Snapshots, Eleanor McEvoy's third studio album, was {{released}} in 1999. McEvoy's primary goal was to make Snapshots her most song-oriented album to date. Toward that goal, McEvoy hooked up with producer Rupert Hine (who worked with Stevie Nicks, Tina Turner, Suzanne Vega, and Duncan Sheik). The extensive use of drum loops on the album was a complete change in style from McEvoy's previous work. This is McEvoy's only album on which <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>play</b> violin. Before the overdub sessions, she was attacked whilst {{walking down the street}} {{on the way home from}} the studio and her hand broken, although she recovered completely. Columbia Records had not been prepared for these changes and not long after the release of Snapshots McEvoy was dropped; her subsequent recordings were on independent labels.|$|E
50|$|She tries and {{fails to}} gain a {{candidacy}} at Beckenham, Hemel Hempstead and Maidstone, up against old boy networks, prejudice against her due to being a woman, {{a mother and a}} grocer's daughter and the party's preference for male war veterans. Frustrated at the shattering of her dreams of a political career being meritocratic, Margaret is in despair. Denis, however, suggests that <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>play</b> by the old-boys' rules but instead uses what they perceive as her weakness (being a woman) against them. Margaret takes up his suggestion, going blonde and—through a show of tears in an interview with Kaberry, chairman of candidates—receiving information of a possible candidacy in Finchley. The seat has a safe Tory majority but its present holder John Crowder is not managing that majority well and an alternative holder is being considered.|$|E

5000|$|Pure Heroine is an electronica, dream pop and electropop album. Lorde's {{voice on}} Pure Heroine is [...] "unique and powerfully intriguing" [...] {{according}} to music online publication PopMatters and {{was described as}} being [...] "way beyond her years" [...] Lorde has stated her main focus during the album is her voice as <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>play</b> any instruments saying [...] "I don't play any instruments, so my voice needs to have the focus. My vocal-scape is really important."Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine, described Lorde's vocals as being [...] "dynamic" [...] during the album, noting Lorde's changing vocal style. [...] "Ribs" [...] uses a [...] "waxing poetic" [...] vocal, whilst [...] "Buzzcut Season" [...] sees Lorde's voice try [...] "to sail off". Pure Heroine also features [...] "smoky and restrained" [...] vocals. The album's production contains a variety of genres including indie, pop, rock, EDM and electro-hop.|$|E
5000|$|... "At organbuilders {{conventions}} I generally listen {{intently to}} the instrument, appreciate {{the efforts of}} the organist, and pay relatively little attention to the performances. But I was powerless to ignore the playing of Chelsea Chen. It's easy to qualify, to say 'she's great...for one so young!' Playing like that is captivating, regardless of age. It wasn't just that I enjoyed her selections or agreed with her choice of stops. <b>She</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>play</b> the organ. She makes the organ her instrument for making music. Her every move is musical. Every piston she pushes, every manual change, every tiny nudge of the shades is a fluid part of her music. I watched her left hand playing the almost inaudible accompaniment in the Bach 'Badinerie'. Every note perfectly attacked and released. Not fussy, just perfect. If Chelsea Chen is a harbinger of the generation on the horizon, there's {{going to be a lot}} of organbuilding to do." ...|$|E

She performed briefly during her cameo appearance in the [...] "Everything Sunny All the Time Always" [...] episode of 30 Rock. She has stated that her favorite composer is Johannes Brahms, because she thinks Brahms's music is [...] "passionate but not sentimental."
