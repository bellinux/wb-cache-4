50|$|If either fetal {{or adult}} bovine serum is {{incorporated}} in the nutrient medium of cell cultures used to propagate PPV, it should be pretested for viral inhibitors. The same may apply to sera of several other species. Because replication of PPV is affected by mitotic activity, {{the effect of the}} serum on the cells is also especially important. In addition, cultures should be pretested for PPV contamination. Cultures are sometimes unknowingly prepared from infected tissues of fetal and postnatal pigs. Moreover, PPV can be accidentally introduced into cultures in several ways, including the use of contaminated trypsin. If contamination is detected before all cells are infected, the virus can be eliminated by repeatedly <b>subculturing</b> the cells in the presence of nutrient medium containing PPV antiserum.|$|E
5000|$|The minimum {{bactericidal}} concentration (MBC) is {{the lowest}} concentration of an antibacterial agent required to kill a particular bacterium. [...] It can be determined from broth dilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) tests by <b>subculturing</b> to agar plates that do not contain the test agent. The MBC is identified by determining the lowest concentration of antibacterial agent that reduces {{the viability of the}} initial bacterial inoculum by ≥99.9%. The MBC is complementary to the MIC; whereas the MIC test demonstrates the lowest level of antimicrobial agent that inhibits growth, the MBC demonstrates the lowest level of antimicrobial agent that results in microbial death. This means that even if a particular MIC shows inhibition, plating the bacteria onto agar might still result in organism proliferation because the antimicrobial did not cause death. Antibacterial agents are usually regarded as bactericidal if the MBC is no more than four times the MIC. [...] Because the MBC test uses colony-forming units as a proxy measure of bacterial viability, it can be confounded by antibacterial agents which cause aggregation of bacterial cells. Examples of antibacterial agents which do this include flavonoids and peptides.|$|E
5000|$|After {{passing the}} {{yellow fever virus}} through {{laboratory}} mice, Theiler found that the weakened virus conferred immunity on rhesus macaques. [...] The stage was set for Theiler to develop a vaccine against the disease. Theiler first devised a test for the efficacy of experimental vaccines. In his test, sera from vaccinated human subjects were injected into mice {{to see if they}} protected the mice against yellow fever virus. This “mouse protection test” was used with variations as a measure of immunity until after World War II. [...] <b>Subculturing</b> the particularly virulent Asibi strain from West Africa in chicken embryos, a technique pioneered by Ernest Goodpasture, the Rockefeller team sought to obtain an attenuated strain of the virus that would not kill mice when injected into their brains. It took until 1937, and more than 100 subcultures in chicken embryos, for Theiler and his colleague Hugh Smith to obtain an attenuated strain, which they named [...] "17D". Animal tests showed the attenuated 17D mutant was safe and immunizing. Theiler's team rapidly completed the development of a 17D vaccine, and the Rockefeller Foundation began human trials in South America. Between 1940 and 1947, the Rockefeller Foundation produced more than 28 million doses of the vaccine and finally ended yellow fever as a major disease.|$|E

5000|$|However, the {{opposite}} effect is visible in cases of asparaginase resistant cancers. In these resistant cancers, the effect of blood asparagine depletion through L-asparaginase instead leads to significant asparagine synthetase overexpression to compensate, effectively nullifying {{the effect of the}} chemotherapy drug. For example, in mouse models, 24 hours after exposure to L-asparaginase, tumors resistant to the depletion responded with 5- to 19-fold increases in asparagine synthetase expression. These resistant tumors also inherently express higher levels of asparagine synthetase activity, even without the application of L-asparaginase to drive further expression. Similar trends are often seen in human studies as well, with high levels of asparagine synthetase activity being detected in asparaginase-resistant cases of treatment as compared with the negligible activity of susceptible cases. Interestingly, as seen in in vitro studies of resistant human leukemia cell lines, even six weeks after the removal of asparagine depleting factors, the increased level of expression of asparagine synthetase failed to return to a basal state, instead remaining elevated and retaining continued drug resistance. It has been further demonstrated in mouse model systems that repeated <b>subculturing</b> of L-asparaginase sensitive tumor cells in sublethal concentrations of L-asparaginase could eventually make them resistant, a potential worry of lower dose chemotherapy treatments effectively encouraging resistant cell development.|$|E

The second phase of the study was designed to determine if aerobic bottles eventually became radiometrically positive in those cases in which they were radiometrically negative but subculture positive on day 3. Two bottles were subculture positive but never gave a growth index of greater than or equal to 25 by day 7. One yielded Staphylococcus epidermidis, and one yielded viridans, Streptococcus sp. A total of 35 anaerobic organisms were isolated from 3, 896 blood specimens. All of these anaerobes were detected by both radiometric testing and <b>subculturing.</b> We examined a total of 14, 972 blood culture bottles. Twenty-nine bottles considered negative by visual inspection or radiometric readings were found to be positive by <b>subculturing.</b> Fifteen of these were shown, by chart review, to contain contaminants.

40|$|Selection of {{resistance}} to amoxicillin (with or without clavulanate), cefaclor, cefuroxime, and azithromycin among six penicillin G- and azithromycin-susceptible pneumococcal strains and among four strains with intermediate penicillin sensitivities (azithromycin MICs, 0. 125 to 4 μg/ml) was studied by performing 50 sequential subcultures in medium with sub-MICs of these antimicrobial agents. For {{only one of the}} six penicillin-susceptible strains did <b>subculturing</b> in medium with amoxicillin (with or without clavulanate) lead to an increased MIC, with the MIC rising from 0. 008 to 0. 125 μg/ml. Five of the six penicillin-susceptible strains showed increased azithromycin MICs (0. 5 to > 256. 0 μg/ml) after 17 to 45 subcultures. <b>Subculturing</b> in medium with cefaclor did not affect the cefaclor MICs of three strains but and led to increased cefaclor MICs (from 0. 5 to 2. 0 to 4. 0 μg/ml) for three of the six strains, with MICs of other β-lactams rising 1 to 3 twofold dilutions. <b>Subculturing</b> in cefuroxime led to increased cefuroxime MICs (from 0. 03 to 0. 06 μg/ml to 0. 125 to 0. 5 μg/ml) for all six strains without significantly altering the MICs of other β-lactams, except for one strain, which developed an increased cefaclor MIC. <b>Subculturing</b> in azithromycin did not affect β-lactam MICs. <b>Subculturing</b> of the four strains with decreased penicillin susceptibility in amoxicillin (with or without clavulanate) or cefuroxime did not select for β-lactam resistance. <b>Subculturing</b> of one strain in cefaclor led to an increase in MIC from 0. 5 to 2. 0 μg/ml after 19 passages. In contrast to strains that were initially azithromycin susceptible, which required > 10 subcultures for resistance selection, three of four strains with azithromycin MICs of 0. 125 to 4. 0 μg/ml showed increased MICs after 7 to 13 passages, with the MICs increasing to 16 to 32 μg/ml.

40|$|The {{effect of}} serial in vitro <b>subculturing</b> on three {{pathogenic}} strains of Saprolegnia parasitica was investigated.

The isolate obtained from diseased fish {{served as a}} virulent reference culture and was designated ‘AP ’ (‘activated through passage’). Suc-cessive <b>subculturing</b> was made by obtaining an inoculum from AP to produce the 2 nd subculture and then passaged to the 3 rd subculture (from the 2 nd), until the 15 th passage was obtained.
