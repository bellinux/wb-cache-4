30|$|The {{anterior}} <b>Smith–Petersen</b> <b>approach</b> {{was utilized}} {{to address the}} majority of these injuries. This approach provides excellent visualization of most fractures, allows anterior femoral head dislocation, and does not disrupt the posterior based blood supply to the proximal femur. The <b>Smith-Petersen</b> <b>approach</b> has been associated with increased rates of HO [11]. Our series found that 40.6 % of all patients developed radiographic signs of HO. This finding exceeds the overall 16.8 % HO rate described by Giannoudis et al. in their systematic review [1], but likely represents our predominant use of the anterior approach. Despite the radiographic finding of HO, we found that it was rarely bridging and rarely limited the patient clinically. Two patients required an additional surgical procedure for excision.|$|E
40|$|The classic ilioinguinal {{approach}} has become well {{established in the}} treatment of acetabular fractures. However, in certain cases with extensive low anterior column or anterior wall fractures less than optimal exposure may be obtained. The authors present a modification of the ilioinguinal approach by combining it with a <b>Smith-Petersen</b> <b>approach</b> with a modified skin incision. This provides improved visualization and access, especially in comminuted low anterior column and anterior wall fractures, may facilitate reduction maneuvers to the quadrilateral surface, and allows the option of intraarticular inspection. In addition, the risk of iatrogenic lateral femoral cutaneous nerve damage is diminished. In this article the technique of this modification is described and illustrate...|$|E

30|$|Two {{commonly}} used approaches in THA are the Moore approach (posterior approach) and the modified Hardinge approach (direct lateral approach) (Pellicci et al. 1998; Hardinge 1982; Finnish Arthroplasty society 2015; Madsen et al. 2004). Other possible <b>approaches</b> are the <b>Smith-Petersen</b> direct anterior <b>approach</b> and the Watson-Jones anterolateral <b>approach</b> (<b>Smith-Petersen</b> 1949; Watson-Jones 1934). Chechik et al. surveyed 292 orthopedic surgeons from 57 countries {{and found that}} the posterior approach was used by 45 % and the direct lateral approach by 42 %. The anterior approach was used by 10 % of the surgeons and other approaches by 3 % (Chechik et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE The pararectus {{approach}} has been validated for managing acetabular fractures. We hypothesised it might be an alternative approach for performing periacetabular osteotomy (PAO). METHODS Using four cadaver specimens, we randomly performed PAO through either the pararectus or a modified <b>Smith-Petersen</b> (SP) <b>approach.</b> We assessed technical feasibility and safety. Furthermore, we controlled fragment mobility using a surgical navigation system and compared mobility between approaches. The navigation system's accuracy was tested by cross-examination with validated preoperative planning software. RESULTS The pararectus approach is technically feasible, allowing for adequate exposure, safe osteotomies and excellent control of structures at risk. Fragment mobility is equal to that achieved through the SP approach. Validation of these measurements yielded a mean difference of less < 1  mm without statistical significance. CONCLUSION Experimental data suggests the pararectus approach might be an alternative approach for performing PAO. Clinical validation is necessary to confirm these promising preliminary results...|$|R
40|$|Background: Total hip athroplasty {{with the}} {{anterior}} surgical approach is advised because the dissection is entirely within intermuscular planes. In this report we describe a minimally invasive technique of anterior total hip arthroplasty, {{with the early}} outcomes. Materials and Methods: The technique of minimally invasive total hip arthroplasty with anterior <b>approach</b> (<b>Smith-Petersen)</b> is described. We reviewed data on 100 consecutive patients who underwent anterior total hip arthroplasty with uncemented components. Mean patient age was 61 years (range 33 - 91). Mean patience BMI 29. 8 (range 18. 1 - 51. 8). Results: Minumum follow up duration is 10 months. The mean duration of surgery was 53 min (range 34 - 87) with mean blood loss 185 cc (range 65 - 630), and the mean incision length was 10. 4 cm. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were similar to historical outcomes of standard total hip arthroplasty. Conclusions: With proper surgeon training, minimally invasive total hip replacement with the anterior surgical interval is safe and efficacious...|$|R
40|$|In {{residual}} {{hip dysplasia}} periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) can improve insufficient {{coverage of the}} femoral head. It requires a broad dissection of the pelvic bones and detachment of muscle insertions, however. We have developed a modification of the Bernese periacetabular osteotomy with reduced soft tissue exposure. It uses two small skin incisions and offers therefore the perspective of nicer scars but also {{increases the risk of}} technical complications due to impaired vision. To be able to draft these risks, the clinical and radiographic results of 23 patients with PAO through the modified <b>Smith-Petersen</b> <b>approach</b> of Ganz (group A) and 24 patients with our two-incision modification (group B) have been reviewed retrospectively with an average follow-up of 19 (group A) and 12 (group B) months postoperatively...|$|E
30|$|The direct {{anterior}} {{approach is}} a modification of the <b>Smith–Petersen</b> <b>approach,</b> as only the distal part of the anterior superior iliac spine is used. This technique became routine practice for Judet and Judet in 1947 [12, 13] {{with the introduction of}} a dedicated trauma table. More recently, Matta transformed the surgical procedure into a minimally invasive procedure in which the patient is also positioned on a dedicated trauma table [4, 14]. Currently, more and more surgeons perform the minimally invasive direct anterior approach without a dedicated trauma table [1, 5, 15]. This variant offers a number of advantages: it does not require the presence of personnel trained to perform trauma table maneuvers; furthermore limb length, implant stability, and movement of the operated hip can be checked more readily, as the lower limbs are free.|$|E
40|$|In {{adolescents}} and young adults, femoral neck fractures often result from high-velocity trauma. These fractures are usually of vertical shear pattern. There is an increased incidence of avascular necrosis and non-union, which is difficult to treat. Non-union of fractured neck of femur in young adults is a serious problem. There is growing evidence that these fractures should be treated with an angle-stable device to improve biomechanics at the fracture site. An ideal implant should prevent varus deformation and retroversion of the fracture {{in order to prevent}} failure of the osteosynthesis and thus preventing cut-out of implant and non-union at the fracture site. We report the first use of an Orthofix Gottfried Percutaneous Compression Plate (PC. C. P.) (Orthofix, Guilford, UK) to treat a non-union of an intra-capsular fractured neck of femur. We recommend this, in combination with autologous bone grafting, via a mini hip modification of the <b>Smith–Petersen</b> <b>approach...</b>|$|E

30|$|There {{is also no}} {{documented}} {{benefit of}} the two-incision route. On the contrary, a randomized cadaver trial revealed that significantly more muscle mass is damaged by {{the passage of the}} rasps and stem during preparation and implantation with the two-incision method versus the mini-posterior technique (gluteus medius, 15.4 vs. 4.7  %, p =  0.0046; gluteus minimus 17.37 vs. 8.62  %, p =  0.002) [5]. A prospective randomized trial comparing the two-incision and mini-incision posterior procedures did not reveal differences in perioperative outcomes between these two approaches [6]. Alecci et al. [7] compared intra- and perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing surgery with the minimally invasive direct anterior approach or the standard lateral approach, and reported that the minimally invasive approach provided better perioperative outcomes. The mini-anterior or <b>Smith–Petersen</b> <b>approach</b> is certainly the most anatomical, although it sacrifices a branch of the anterior circumflex artery and exposes the lateral cutaneous femoral nerve to risk. It provides optimal access to the acetabulum, {{but it is difficult to}} implant the stem without damaging the gluteus medius and tensor muscles. Consequently, Berger proposed the two-incision approach (anterior for the acetabulum, and lateral for the femur) [8].|$|E
3000|$|The acetabuloplasty {{procedure}} that was performed was a Dega modified osteotomy (or San Diego osteotomy), {{as described by}} Mubarak et al. [3]. Through a <b>Smith–Petersen</b> <b>approach,</b> a curvilinear osteotomy was made 0.5 – 1  cm above the acetabular margin extending anteriorly and posteriorly through the sciatic notch. Under fluoroscopic guidance, it extended from the lateral cortex {{in the direction of}} the triradiate cartilage without crossing it. The osteotomy was progressively opened until maximum coverage of the femoral head was obtained. The bone removed from the femoral osteotomy was then reshaped and placed in the acetabular osteotomy site, as described by Sankar et al. [4]. The difference with the classical Dega osteotomy was that cuts were performed in the anterior and posterior edges of the pelvis to improve the posterior coverage of the femoral head. A bilateral spica cast was applied postoperatively for six weeks, with hips in extension, neutral rotation and 30 ° of abduction, in order to (1) decrease the postoperative pain, (2) lower the risk of osteotomy displacement and (3) maintain bilateral hips abduction. The cast was open in order to allow skin verification and prevention of pressure ulcers [...]...|$|E
40|$|Objective : The Bernese periacetabular {{osteotomy}} (PAO) is {{a widely}} used technique {{for the treatment of}} non-arthritic, dysplastic, painful hips. It is considered a highly complex procedure with a steep learning curve. In an attempt to minimize complications, a double anterior-posterior approach has been described. We report on our experience while performing this technique on cadaveric hips followed by meticulous dissection to verify possible complications. Methods : We operated on 15 fresh cadaveric hips using a combined posterior Kocher-Langenbeck and an anterior <b>Smith-Petersen</b> <b>approach,</b> without fluoroscopic control. The PAO cuts were performed and the acetabular fragment was mobilized. A meticulous dissection was carried out to verify the precision of the cuts. Results : Complications were observed in seven specimens (46 %). They included a posterior column fracture, and posterior and anterior articular fractures. The incidence of complications decreased over time, from 60 % in the first five procedures to 20 % in the last five procedures. Conclusions : We concluded that PAO using a combined anterior-posterior approach is a reproducible technique that allows all cuts to be done under direct visualization. The steep learning curve described in the classic single incision approach was also observed when using two approaches. Evidence Level: IV, Cadaveric Study...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Data {{concerning}} outcome after {{management of}} acetabular fractures by anterior approaches with focus on age and fractures associated with roof impaction, central dislocation and/or quadrilateral plate displacement are rare. METHODS Between October 2005 and April 2009 {{a series of}} 59 patients (mean age 57 years, range 13 - 91) with fractures involving the anterior column was treated using the modified Stoppa approach alone or for reduction of displaced iliac wing or low anterior column fractures {{in combination with the}} 1 st window of the ilioinguinal approach or the modified <b>Smith-Petersen</b> <b>approach,</b> respectively. Surgical data, accuracy of reduction, clinical and radiographic outcome at mid-term and the need for endoprosthetic replacement in the postoperative course (defined as failure) were assessed; uni- and multivariate regression analysis were performed to identify independent predictive factors (e. g. age, nonanatomical reduction, acetabular roof impaction, central dislocation, quadrilateral plate displacement) for a failure. Outcome was assessed for all patients in general and in accordance to age in particular; patients were subdivided into two groups according to their age (group "< 60 yrs", group "≥ 60 yrs"). RESULTS Forty-three of 59 patients (mean age 54 yrs, 13 - 89) were available for evaluation. Of these, anatomic reduction was achieved in 72...|$|E
30|$|All {{operations}} {{were carried out}} in the lateral decubitus position using the minimally invasive modified <b>Smith-Petersen</b> <b>approach</b> [10]. Press-fit cups (Pinnacle; DePuy, Warsaw, IN, USA) and cement-free hydroxyapatite-coated stems (Corail®; DePuy) were used. Preoperative planning was performed by using a common planning program for endoprosthesis (mediCAD; Hectec GmbH, Altdorf, Germany). Stem size was confirmed by intra- and postoperative X-rays. No obvious undersizing was detected. The Corail® stem is a straight tapered cement-free stem filling the metaphysis and proximal diaphysis in the mediolateral plane. Although the position of the femoral component is dictated in part by the native femoral neck anteversion, the final position of the ‘best-fit’ stem is a compromise of fitting the straight stem down the canal of the femur and addressing the flexion and twist of the proximal femur. The extent to which anteversion of the final implant may be influenced by the surgeon [6, 7] is yet unclear. Tribological pairing consisted of polyethylene liners and metal heads with a diameter of 32  mm. Six weeks after surgery, a CT scan was obtained from the pelvis down to the femoral condyles (Somatom Sensation 16; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). This investigation was approved by the local Ethics Committee (No. 10 - 121 - 0263). All procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000.|$|E

To be able to draft these risks, the clinical and radiographic results of 23 patients with PAO through the modified <b>Smith-Petersen</b> <b>approach</b> of Ganz (group A) and 24 patients with our two-incision modification (group B) have been re-viewed retrospectively with an average follow-up of 19 (group A) and 12 (group B) months postoperatively. Functional improvement (Harris Hip Score) and center-edge-angle normalization did not differ significantly in both groups. Scars of patients in group B were significantly shorter. However, the overall patient satisfaction (as measured with a visual analogous scale) was the same in both groups. 4 patients in group A and one patient in group B developed super-ficial or deep wound infections. In conclusion, the experience with our cohort study showed that approach-related morbidity can be reduced without in-creasing the risk for the individual patient. This observation clearly holds a promise for further minimal invasive ap-proaches as well as for further morbidity reduction of PAO.

40|$|Surgical Tooling Designed for the Direct Anterior Approach to Total Hip Arthroplasty Jon-Peter Meckel Total hip {{arthroplasty}} (THA) {{is becoming}} more and more common in the US as people continue to live longer and more active lives. The main reason that a THA is required is due to the “wear and tear” affliction of osteoarthritis, which in the year 2000 had at least 3 % of the population over 30 showing symptoms. A revitalized approach to THA is the direct anterior approach, or <b>Smith-Petersen</b> <b>approach,</b> which limits the amount of musculature affected by the surgery and creates a very stable joint post-operatively. While this approach is showing great clinical success, it does require slightly unconventional patient positioning. The pioneers of this surgical approach include Dr. Joel Matta, who along with Mizuhosi (Union City, CA, USA) has created an impressive direct anterior approach surgical table to address the problems associated with getting patients in the right position. Unfortunately, this table is very expensive, gives no feedback on force application, and surgeons are being taught that it is required to perform the procedure. This thesis introduces a simple set of surgical tooling that facilitates the direct anterior approach very cost effectively, giving the surgeon the feedback lacking in the expensive Mizuhosi table, and the flexibility to attempt the approach without convincing his or her hospital to make such a large capital investment. A prototype was successfully developed and tested to show that a simple solution exists to make the direct anterior approach more feasible for surgeons to incorporate into their practice...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{anterior}} {{approach to}} the hip gained popularity for total hip arthroplasty in recent years. Distal extension of the anterior approach, sometimes needed intraoperatively, potentially endangers neurovascular structures to the quadriceps. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the anatomical structures placed at risk by distal extension of the anterior {{approach to the}} hip. Methods: Seventeen cadaveric hemipelves from twelve human specimens were dissected. The femoral nerve and its branches and the vessels arising from the lateral femoral circumflex artery were assessed in relation to the distal extension of the anterior approach. The damage caused by the introduction of a cerclage cable passer was also investigated. Results: The area immediately distal to the intertrochanteric line is a common entry point for several nerve branches and is a useful distal landmark for surgeons to use to protect important neurovascular structures. The distal extension of the anterior approach compromises the nerve supply to the anterolateral portions of the quadriceps. Introduction of a cerclage cable passer through the anterior access also jeopardizes nerve branches to the vastus lateralis, lateral parts of the vastus intermedius, and branches of the lateral femoral circumflex artery. Conclusions: Distal extension of the direct anterior approach to the hip is challenging to accomplish without neurovascular injury to anterolateral parts of the quadriceps muscle group. In addition, important neurovascular structures are endangered with the introduction of a cable passer through the anterior approach. Clinical Relevance: Distal extension of the direct anterior approach to the hip beyond the intertrochanteric line may compromise neurovascular structures supplying the quadriceps muscle. The direct anterior approach for total hip arthroplasty has recently gained popularity with good clinical results. However, there have been reports of intraoperative complications, such as femoral fracture, implant failure, and muscle trauma 7 - 12, that may require an extension of the surgical approach. Kennon et al. 1 reported that the direct anterior approach could be safely extended proximally and distally even in complex revisions without clinically relevant nerve injuries. Furthermore, a textbook on surgical exposures describes and recommends this option 13. While proximal extension with detachment of the tensor fascia femoris and gluteal muscles from the pelvis is part of the <b>Smith-Petersen</b> <b>approach,</b> distal extension could endanger neurovascular structures. The anatomical relationship of nerve branches and blood vessels to the quadriceps with respect to the anterior approach has not been documented, to our knowledge. The purpose of this cadaver study was to demonstrate the neurovascular structures encountered during the direct anterior approach to the hip joint with special emphasis on potential distal extension or the placement of a cerclage cable passer around the proximal part of the femur...|$|E
