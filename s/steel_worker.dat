His mother, Jennie Kaughn, 16, was an {{unemployed}} drifter from Philadelphia; his father, Robert Wilson, 24, was a <b>steel</b> <b>worker.</b> His parents never married; both were heavy drinkers, and in 1907 {{his mother died}} of appendicitis {{at the age of}} 24.|$|E

25|$|Jackson {{was born}} December 11, 1954 in Gary, Indiana, after his brother Tito Jackson. He {{is the fourth}} child born to Joseph and Katherine Jackson. His {{siblings}} are Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, La Toya, Marlon, Michael, Randy, and Janet. His father Joseph had musical aspirations, playing guitar with his brother’s band, The Falcons, and Katherine was a passionate pianist and singer. But their large family and lack of money ended their dreams with Katherine becoming a housewife, and Joseph, a <b>steel</b> <b>worker</b> at nearby Inland Steel Company in East Chicago, Indiana (his parents lived there before they moved to Gary in 1950). While his father worked long hours as a crane operator, Jermaine and his brothers, Tito and Jackie, secretly practiced their own songs using their father's guitar. Jermaine became the original lead singer of the Jackson Brothers—an earlier incarnation of The Jackson Five until 1966, when younger brother (Michael Jackson) began singing lead. Jermaine would continue to provide some leads over the years. Jermaine graduated from Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California in 1973.|$|E

500|$|Returning home to Sheffield in 1976, Dickinson {{enrolled}} at King Edward VII School, {{at which he}} joined his first band. He had overheard two other pupils talking about their band and that they needed a singer and so volunteered immediately. They rehearsed in the garage of the drummer's father, and the band were impressed by Dickinson's singing, encouraging him to buy his first microphone. Their first gig {{took place at the}} Broadfield Tavern in Sheffield. Originally called [...] "Paradox", the band changed their name on Dickinson's suggestion to [...] "Styx", unaware of the American act with the same name. They made local newspaper headlines when a <b>steel</b> <b>worker</b> was awoken by their performance and tried to smash the band's drum kit. Soon afterwards the band split up.|$|E

He attended the University of Northampton and the Art and Design Academy from 1970 to 1973.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the asbestos burden in a steelplant environment, we counted asbestos bodies (ABs) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of 65 <b>steel</b> <b>workers</b> who had retired {{during the previous}} 5 y. They had worked for at least 15 y {{in the same area}} of the plant (coke oven or blast furnace) as maintenance or production workers. On the basis of occupational anamnesis, 28 had occasional past professional exposure to asbestos; the remaining 37 workers denied any contact with asbestos. A total of 54 white-collar workers who had no occupational exposure to asbestos were included in the study as controls. An increased prevalence and concentration of ABs was found in the BALF of <b>steel</b> <b>workers.</b> Electron microscopy and EDAX analysis of AB from <b>steel</b> <b>workers</b> revealed that the core fibers were mainly amphiboles. More ABs were found in the BALF of maintenance workers than in production workers. However, the BALF from <b>steel</b> <b>workers</b> who denied any contact with asbestos revealed an increased AB burden v. controls. This demonstrates that <b>steel</b> <b>workers</b> may be subject to an occult exposure to amphiboles in the steelplant environment. Peer reviewe...|$|R

When Bush came to the Pittsburgh area on Labor Day 2002, 65-year-old retired <b>steel</b> <b>worker</b> Bill Neel was there to greet him with a sign proclaiming, 'The Bush family must surely love the poor, they made so many of us.' The local police, at the Secret Service's behest, set up a 'designated free-speech zone' on a baseball field surrounded by a chain-link fence {{a third of a}} mile from the location of Bush's speech. The police cleared the path of the motorcade of all critical signs, though folks with pro-Bush signs were permitted to line the president's path. Neel refused to go to the designated area and was arrested for disorderly conduct.

2500|$|When {{he joined}} the Port Talbot Squadron 499 of the Air Training Corps section of the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a cadet, he re-encountered Philip, who was the {{squadron}} commander. He also joined the Taibach Youth Center, a youth drama group founded by Meredith Jones and led by Leo Lloyd, a <b>steel</b> <b>worker</b> and avid amateur thespian, who taught him the fundamentals of acting. Richard {{played the role of}} an escaped convict in Lloyd's play, The Bishop's Candlesticks, an adaptation of a section of Victor Hugo's Les Misérables. The entire play did not have any dialogues, but Alpert noted that Richard [...] "mimed his role". Philip gave him a part in a radio documentary/adaptation of his play for BBC Radio, Youth at the Helm (1942). Seeing the talent Richard possessed, both Jones and Philip re-admitted him to school on 5 October 1942. Philip called Richard [...] "my son to all intents and purposes. I was committed to him." [...] Philip tutored his charge intensely in school subjects, and also worked at developing the youth's acting voice, including outdoor voice drills which improved his projection. Richard called the experience [...] "the most hardworking and painful period" [...] in his life.|$|E
2500|$|Los Angeles Stock Exchange Building: 618 S. Spring Street – Built in 1929, the eleven-story {{exchange}} {{building was}} designed by Samuel Lunden in the Moderne style. [...] Ground was broken in October 1929, just as the Great Depression hit, and when the Los Angeles Stock Exchange opened its doors there in 1931, the country was deep into the Depression. [...] There are three bas-relief panels carved by Salvatore Cartaino Scarpitta into the granite above the building's entrance. [...] The panels portray {{the elements of a}} capitalist economy. [...] The large central panel, [...] "Finance", displays capitalists. [...] The [...] "Production" [...] panel shows an aircraft engine, a <b>steel</b> <b>worker</b> pouring molten metal and a worker stirring it. The [...] "Research and Discovery" [...] panel shows oil derricks, factories, a chemist conducting an experiment and a man kneeling in a library reading a book. The interior is wonderfully preserved, and has ancient Near East and Native Indian influences by the designer Julian Ellsworth Garnsey. On the entrance lobby's ceiling the Wilson Studio created four sculpted figures representing: Speed (Mercury), Accuracy (the archer), Permanence (a figure contemplating the universe), and Equality (the figure bearing scales). The highlight of the interior was its massive 90' x 74' balconied trading floor with a forty-foot ceiling and sixty-four booths. On fifth floor was a clearing-house with a statistics department, an auditorium, and a lecture room. Offices occupied floors six through nine, and the top two floors included: a club with a library, a card room, a billiard room, and reading rooms. The basement held a 2,660-sq. ft. printing room and a vault. In 1986, the exchange (by then part of the Pacific Stock Exchange) moved out of the building. [...] In the late 1980s, the Community Redevelopment Agency helped fund a night club that opened in the Exchange Building—called the Stock Exchange, but the club did not survive the 1980s. In late 2008, the building underwent extensive renovations and reopened in 2010 as Exchange LA nightclub. [...] The visually dynamic building and interiors are frequently used for location filming, and has been featured in The Big Lebowski, The Social Network, and numerous television shows and commercials. Special events include corporate parties, product debuts, and fashion shows. The Stock Exchange Building was designated a Historic Cultural Landmark (HCM #205) in 1979.|$|E
