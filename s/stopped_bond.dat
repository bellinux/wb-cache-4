40|$|To {{appropriate}} additional {{sources of}} fiscal revenue, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) started direct underwriting of new deficit-financing government bond, (GBs) (BOJ underwriting) on November 25, 1932. This paper examines the BOJ's underwriting policymaking process {{through the use}} of newly available archived documents from the BOJ and the Ministry of Finance (MOF). Evidence from these documents contradicts conventional arguments that the BOJ was forced to underwrite GBs due to Finance Minister Korekiyo Takahashi's firm request and that it regarded the policy measure as temporary. Instead, the BOJ was confident it could exert monetary control through the market operation of selling underwritten GBs (selling operations). In addition, the BOJ willingly accepted the underwriting, expecting it to reinforce its influence over financial institutions. BOJ policymakers partly forecasted the course of events. First, the BOJ started underwriting during the Takahashi economic policy period (1931 - 36). Once it started, it was difficult for the BOJ to <b>stop</b> underwriting <b>bonds.</b> The BOJ was forced to continue underwriting deficit-financing bonds because of expanding financial demand. Second the MOF used very complex and irregular budgeting methods beginning with the budget process of fiscal 1936. This created a large deferred fiscal burden that concealed the realities of fiscal deficits. ...|$|R

At the end of the fifth novel, From Russia with Love, Bond is unable to draw the Beretta at a critical moment when its silencer catches on the holster and is very nearly killed as a result. This incident leads to an order from his superior officer, M, to start carrying a new duty weapon in the opening chapters of the sixth novel, Dr. No. Major Boothroyd, introduced as the MI6 armorer and [...] "the greatest small-arms expert in the world", insists that Bond trade it for a weapon with more <b>stopping</b> power. <b>Bond</b> is issued a Walther PPK, and a Smith & Wesson Centennial Airweight revolver for situations where he needs more power than the PPK can offer.

40|$|Insurance {{companies}} are seeking more adequate liquidity funds {{to cover the}} insured property losses related to nature and man-made disasters. Past experience shows that the losses caused by catastrophic events, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods or hurricanes, are extremely large. One of the alternative methods of covering these extreme losses is to transfer part of the risk to the financial markets, by issuing catastrophe-linked bonds. This thesis focuses on model and value Catastrophe (CAT) risk bonds. The findings of this thesis is twofold. First, we study the pricing process for CAT bonds with different model setups. Second, based on different framework, we structured three catastrophe based (earthquake, general and nuclear risk) bonds, estimated {{the parameters of the}} model by employing real world data and obtained numerical results using Monte Carlo simulation. Comparison between different models is also conducted. The first model employed the structure of n financial and m catastrophe-independent risks, and obtain the valuation framework. This generalized extension allows an easier application in the industry. As an illustration, a structured earthquake is considered with parametric trigger type [...] annual maximum magnitude of the earthquake [...] and the pricing formulas are derived. The second model presents a contingent claim model with the aggregate claims following compound forms where the claim inter-arrival times are dependent on the claim sizes by employing a two-dimensional semi-Markov process. The final model derives nuclear catastrophe (N-CAT) risk bond prices by extending the previous model. A two-coverage type trigger CAT bond is analysed by adding a perturbed state into the claims system, i. e. the system <b>stops</b> (N-CAT <b>bond</b> contract terminated) immediately after a major catastrophe...|$|R
40|$|A {{surgical}} adhesive {{that can}} be used in different surgical situations with or without sutures is a surgeons' dream and yet none has been able to fulfill many such demanding requirements. It was therefore a major challenge to develop an adhesive biomaterial that <b>stops</b> bleeding and <b>bond</b> tissues well, which at the same time is non-toxic, biocompatible and yet biodegradable, economically viable and appealing to the surgeon in terms of the simplicity of application in complex surgical situations. With this aim, we developed an in situ setting adhesive based on biopolymers such as chitosan and dextran. Dextran was oxidized using periodate to generate aldehyde functions on the biopolymer and then reacted with chitosan hydrochloride. Gelation occurred instantaneously upon mixing these components and the resulting gel showed good tissue adhesive properties with negligible cytotoxicity and minimal swelling in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Rheology analysis confirmed the gelation process by demonstrating storage modulus having value higher than loss modulus. Adhesive strength was in the range 200 - 400 gf/cm(2) which is about 4 - 5 times more than that of fibrin glue at comparable setting times. The adhesive showed burst strength in the range of 400 - 410 mm of Hg which should make the same suitable as a sealant for controlling bleeding in many surgical situations even at high blood pressure. Efficacy of the adhesive as a hemostat was demonstrated in a rabbit liver injury model. Histological features after two weeks were comparable to that of commercially available BioGlue (R). The adhesive also demonstrated its efficacy as a drug delivery vehicle. The present adhesive could function without the many toxicity and biocompatibility issues associated with such products. Statement of Significance Though there are many tissue adhesives available in market, none are free of shortcomings. The newly developed surgical adhesive is a 2 -component adhesive system based on time-tested, naturally occurring polysaccharides such as chitosan and dextran which are both biocompatible and biodegradable. Simple polymer modification has been carried out on both polysaccharides so that when aqueous solutions of both are mixed, the solutions gel in less than 10 s and forms an adhesive that seals a variety of incisions. The strength of the adhesive is over 5 -times the strength of commercially available Fibrin glue and is more tissue compliant than BioGlue. This adhesive biomaterial showed excellent tissue bonding, was hemostatic, biocompatible and biodegradable. The significance of this work lies on the features of the developed tissue adhesive that it <b>stops</b> bleeding, <b>bond</b> the tissues well, can act as a drug delivery vehicle and would appeal to the surgeon in terms of the simplicity of application in complex surgical situations. There is no need for special delivery systems for application of this adhesive. The two-component adhesive can be applied one over the other using syringes. There is also no need for light curing with UV or visible light and the gelation between the two components spontaneously takes place on application leading to excellent tissue bonding.

In this study, roselle fibres were immersed in Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with 3 different concentration (3, 6, and 9 %). The results before and after treatment were compared.

Results shows that the higher concentration of NaOH will increase the surface roughness and have higher ability to clean the fibre. For tensile properties, 6 % of NaOH give the highest tensile strength. It can be concluded that, 6 % of NaOH is the most suitable concentration to clean roselle fibre and while maintaining good tensile properties. 1. ...|$|R
