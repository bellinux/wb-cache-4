The scarf either has a knot tied in the middle and placed in the gagged person's mouth or is an over-the-mouth gag (OTM) placed {{backward}} with the knot tied inside the person's mouth. The knotted gag is able to <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> saliva that the ball gag does not and can be easily washed for reuse. Knots can be doubled or tripled to fit the size of the gagged person's mouth.|$|E
25|$|The {{moisture}} given off by {{the human}} body, even when not exercising and sweating, will condense against {{the inside of the}} dry duit, and the way this condensate is handled by the underwear material will influence the comfort of the diver. If the underwear soaks up this moisture it will feel cold and clammy, particularly if this layer is against the skin. Materials which wick the moisture away from the skin and do not <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> condensate will be more comfortable. Early thermal undersuits for drysuits were commonly made from wool, as it retains its insulating properties better when wet than most other natural fibres.|$|E

The child was sprinkled with “fine and powdery salt, or natron or aphronitre” to <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> birth residue, rinsed, and then powdered and rinsed again. Next, the midwives cleared away any and all mucus present from the nose, mouth, ears, or anus. Midwives were encouraged by Soranus to put olive oil in the baby’s eyes to cleanse away any birth residue, and to place a piece of wool soaked in olive oil over the umbilical cord. After the delivery, the midwife made the initial call {{on whether or not}} an infant was healthy and fit to rear. She inspected the newborn for congenital deformities and testing its cry to hear {{whether or not it was}} robust and hearty. Ultimately, midwives made a determination about the chances for an infant’s survival and likely recommended that a newborn with any severe deformities be exposed.|$|E
500|$|Chris Robinson, {{a renowned}} music video director, was {{contacted}} {{with an offer}} to direct Austin and Watkins' visualization, and took on his first feature with ATL. The films producers decided Robinson would be well-suited for the project because {{of his ability to}} capture the music-driven aspects of the film, as provided by his experience in the field. They also cited his talent in storytelling. According to producer Austin, [...] "a lot of music video directors can't capture the story, so what we'd do was turn on the directors' tapes, turn down the music and just watch {{to see if we could}} find the story. Chris was far and away the best." [...] About making ATL his first feature, Robinson stated that [...] "as a music video director, I'd get a lot of scripts that had to do with really big visual pictures. But I wanted to start off doing something that had heart." [...] After being hired, Robinson traveled to Atlanta and spent time with Austin to try to <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> vibe and energy of the unique city.|$|E
500|$|Station to Station {{is often}} cited as a {{transitional}} album in Bowie's career. Nicholas Pegg, author of The Complete David Bowie, called it a [...] "precise halfway point on the journey from Young Americans to Low", while for Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray, it [...] "effectively divides the '70s for David Bowie. It ties off the era of Ziggy Stardust and plastic soul, and introduces the first taste of the new music that was to follow with Low." [...] In terms of Bowie's own output, Station to Stations Euro-centric flavour had its musical antecedents in tracks like [...] "Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197?)" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] (1973), while its funk/disco elements were a development of the soul/R sound of Young Americans (1975). More recently Bowie had begun to <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> influence of [...] krautrock and electronic music by bands like Neu!, Can, and Kraftwerk. Thematically the album revisited concepts dealt with in songs such as [...] "The Supermen" [...] from The Man Who Sold the World (1970) and [...] "Quicksand" [...] from Hunky Dory (1971): Nietzsche's 'Overman', the occultism of Aleister Crowley, Nazi fascination with Grail mythology, and the Kabbalah. Pegg considered the album's theme to be a clash of [...] "occultism and Christianity".|$|E

500|$|Kyle Ryan of the A.V. Club called Taking Back Sunday's {{sound on}} their debut album [...] "fresh and raw" [...] and their {{approach}} to Louder Now [...] "formulaic." [...] According to Ryan, Lazzara [...] "changed his style a bit" [...] and [...] "occasionally sound like his jaw is wired shut." [...] Entertainment Weekly reviewer Clark Collis wrote that the album's title [...] "justifies its name thanks to a chunkier array of riffs and choruses" [...] compared to Where You Want to Be. Sarah Dean wrote on FasterLouder that Louder Now differs from the band's past records; it has [...] "a darker mood, bigger choruses and perhaps even catchier melodies," [...] with the [...] "emo-pop punk flavour Taking Back Sunday are renowned for." [...] Gigwise contributor Lee Glynn wrote that the album had [...] "no standout tracks" [...] other than [...] "MakeDamnSure." [...] Apart from the latter, [...] "there is nothing on this album that reaffirms them as a band full of malice and bite." [...] Spence D. of IGN gave the album a score of 6.7 out of 10: [...] "It's a safe bet to say that TBS diehards will <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> 11 tracks with a sponge-like vengeance.

2500|$|Simply put, {{economic}} bubbles {{often occur}} when {{too much money}} is chasing too few assets, causing both good assets and bad assets to appreciate excessively beyond their fundamentals to an unsustainable level. [...] Once the bubble bursts, the fall in prices causes the collapse of unsustainable investment schemes (especially speculative and/or Ponzi investments, but not exclusively so), {{which leads to a}} crisis of consumer (and investor) confidence that may result in a financial panic and/or financial crisis; if there is monetary authority like a central bank, it may be forced to take a number of measures in order to <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> liquidity in the financial system or risk a collapse of its currency. [...] This may involve actions like bailouts of the financial system, but also others that reverse the trend of monetary accommodation, commonly termed forms of 'contractionary monetary policy'.|$|E
2500|$|Combating {{the urban}} heat island effect {{is another reason}} for {{creating}} a green roof. [...] Traditional building materials <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> sun's radiation and re-emit it as heat, making cities at least [...] hotter than surrounding areas. [...] On Chicago's City Hall, by contrast, which features a green roof, roof temperatures {{on a hot day}} are typically [...] cooler than they are on traditionally roofed buildings nearby. Green roofs are becoming common in Chicago, as well as in Atlanta, Portland, and other United States cities, where their use is encouraged by regulations to combat the urban heat-island effect. Green roofs are a type of low impact development. In the case of Chicago, the city has passed codes offering incentives to builders who put green roofs on their buildings. [...] The Chicago City Hall green roof is one of the earliest and most well-known examples of green roofs in the United States; it was planted as an experiment to determine the effects a green roof would have on the microclimate of the roof. [...] Following this and other studies, it has now been estimated that if all the roofs in a major city were greened, urban temperatures could be reduced by as much as 7 degrees Celsius.|$|E

2500|$|Affectionately nicknamed [...] "Go" [...] and towering at {{a whopping}} five-foot [...] "ape", the Gorilla is the Phoenix Suns {{favorite}} primate. Most notably, fans {{are familiar with}} the Gorilla for his on the court antics where he raises the Phoenix Suns flag in the name of team-pride, performs notorious slam dunk routines and fires up the crowd. From his early days in the Banana Republic to his education at Fur-man University, the Gorilla has always had a passion for basketball. Before his debut with the Phoenix Suns, the Gorilla delivered singing telegrams. However, in 1980 the Gorilla's fate changed when he stepped onto the court during a game and surprised unsuspecting players and fans. His antics became an instant hit and the Gorilla {{has been a member of}} the Phoenix Suns ever since. Since then, the gorilla, has been known for his slapstick humor during the games such as his stadium stairs all to the sound of the Rocky Theme, and the fantastic dunks that are performed before each 4th quarter. The Gorilla would do a few push-ups on the court, then head off in a quest to climb the stairs of both the lower and upper level of the Coliseum to get to the top. When he reached the base of the upper level, he’d stop for a second to <b>soak</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> applause, then head to the top of the building. When he got there, the crowd would explode. It never failed. Also, one of his more beloved skits was at a Knicks home game where he came out to Frank Sinatra's Theme from New York, wearing a hat, with several pieces of garbage stuck to his leg. Halfway through the song, a group of [...] "muggers" [...] attacked him, and he staggered off the court afterwards. Give him credit, The Gorilla has always been more than a slapstick comedian. In a way, though, that's what makes The Gorilla so much fun. He's not really there just to cheer on the Suns – although he does so with great enthusiasm. The Gorilla just wants to have fun, and wants the rest of us to have fun with him.|$|E
