5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the race, {{all eyes}} were on the battle for third place, as Häkkinen's pace was <b>so</b> <b>slow</b> that Karl Wendlinger was {{catching}} him in the Sauber, aiming to give Sauber their first podium finish. However, Häkkinen was able to resist Wendlinger's challenge and finish in third place, with Wendlinger fourth. Ukyo Katayama finished fifth for Tyrrell and Hill was able to battle back to finish sixth, the last of the points-scorers.|$|E
5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is <b>so</b> <b>slow,</b> on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|On November 31, Smyth tried again, {{ordering}} his men {{to embark}} two hours before dawn {{in order to avoid}} enemy fire. This time, the embarkation was <b>so</b> <b>slow</b> that, two hours after daylight, only 1,500 men were on board. Rather than attempt an amphibious landing in broad daylight, Smyth once again postponed the invasion. By this time, morale in Smyth’s command had plummeted: “all discipline had dissolved; the camp was a bedlam”. This, and widespread illness among the troops, persuaded a second council of war called by Smyth to suspend all offensive operations until the army was reinforced.|$|E
50|$|Stairs {{were also}} {{constructed}} to contain trick or stumble steps. These were steps that had different rise height or tread depth {{from the rest}} and would cause anyone running {{up the stairs to}} stumble or fall, <b>so</b> <b>slowing</b> down the attackers' progress.|$|R
50|$|SVTs can be {{classified}} by whether the AV node is involved in maintaining the rhythm. If <b>so,</b> <b>slowing</b> conduction through the AV node will terminate it. If not, AV nodal blocking maneuvers will not work, although transient AV block is still useful as it may unmask an underlying abnormal rhythm.|$|R
50|$|The Russian First Army {{had been}} <b>so</b> <b>slowed</b> by the combative German cavalry screen {{that by the}} time the battle was over their closest unit was still perhaps as much as 70 km from the trapped Second Army. Other Russian units were {{scattered}} back along the line to Königsberg, leaving the First Army itself in a dangerously spread-out position.|$|R
5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is <b>so</b> <b>slow</b> as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like a caterpillar, attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E
25|$|When tuning {{instruments}} {{that can produce}} sustained tones, beats can be readily recognized. Tuning two tones to a unison will present a peculiar effect: when the two tones are close in pitch but not identical, the difference in frequency generates the beating. The volume varies like in a tremolo as the sounds alternately interfere constructively and destructively. As the two tones gradually approach unison, the beating slows down and may become <b>so</b> <b>slow</b> as to be imperceptible.|$|E
25|$|Hydrolysis {{breaks the}} glycosidic bond {{converting}} sucrose into glucose and fructose. Hydrolysis is, however, <b>so</b> <b>slow</b> that solutions of sucrose can sit {{for years with}} negligible change. If the enzyme sucrase is added, however, the reaction will proceed rapidly. Hydrolysis can also be accelerated with acids, such as cream of tartar or lemon juice, both weak acids. Likewise, gastric acidity converts sucrose to glucose and fructose during digestion, the bond between them being an acetal bond {{which can be broken}} by an acid.|$|E
5000|$|Dithranol accumulates in {{mitochondria}} {{where it}} {{interferes with the}} supply of energy to the cell, probably by the oxidation of dithranol releasing free radicals. This impedes DNA replication and <b>so</b> <b>slows</b> the excessive cell division that occurs in psoriatic plaques. In addition Dithranol may act by reducing the elevated levels of cGMP that occurs in psoriasis.|$|R
50|$|Music {{is related}} in war {{in some regions}} in the country, {{as it is a}} way to show the {{emotions}} of victory and defeat, as well as the resolution of conflict. Philippine music also depends on the biographical factors: in cooler regions such as the Cordilleras, the beat of the music is <b>so</b> <b>slower,</b> while in warmer areas it is quite fast.|$|R

25|$|For example, coal {{burns in}} a {{fireplace}} {{in the presence}} of oxygen, but it does not when it is stored at room temperature. The reaction is spontaneous at low and high temperatures but at room temperature its rate is <b>so</b> <b>slow</b> that it is negligible. The increase in temperature, as created by a match, allows the reaction to start and then it heats itself, because it is exothermic. That is valid for many other fuels, such as methane, butane, and hydrogen.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{of the concept of}} chance throughout history has been very gradual. Historians have wondered why progress in the field of randomness was <b>so</b> <b>slow,</b> given that humans have encountered chance since antiquity. Deborah Bennett suggests that ordinary people face an inherent difficulty in understanding randomness, although the concept is often taken as being obvious and self-evident. She cites studies by Kahneman and Tversky; these concluded that statistical principles are not learned from everyday experience because people do not attend to the detail necessary to gain such knowledge.|$|E
25|$|The Union Pacific Railroad did {{not start}} {{construction}} for another 18 months until July 1865. They were delayed by difficulties obtaining financial backing and the unavailability of workers and materials due to the Civil War. Their start point in the new city of Omaha, Nebraska was not yet connected via railroad to Council Bluffs, Iowa. Equipment needed to begin work was initially delivered to Omaha and Council Bluffs by paddle steamers on the Missouri River. The Union Pacific was <b>so</b> <b>slow</b> in beginning construction during 1865 that they sold {{two of the four}} steam locomotives they had purchased.|$|E
50|$|The state {{legislature}} cut short its September session after {{a dead body}} {{was found on the}} steps of State House. Governor Mifflin became ill and was advised by his doctor to leave. The city's banks remained open. But, banking operations were <b>so</b> <b>slowed</b> by the inability of people to pay off notes because of disruptions from the epidemic that banks automatically renewed notes until the epidemic ended.|$|R
50|$|This {{system was}} {{extended}} to domestic tape decks, and <b>so</b> <b>slower</b> speeds as they were adopted tended to be exactly half the previous slowest speed. Pre-recorded tapes were mostly 71⁄2 ips, with a few at 33⁄4 ips. Message tapes transmitted by post and call logging tapes were commonly recorded at 17⁄8 ips or even 15⁄16 ips. The most common reel-to-reel speed of 71⁄2 ips is approximately 19 cm/s.|$|R
50|$|Zmax {{also has}} a lot less CPU {{overhead}} than Zmodem, <b>so</b> <b>slower</b> computers can drive highspeed modems faster. Zmax does not encode each byte of data like Zmodem does. This reduces the amount of CPU overhead and simplifies the code quite a bit. Zmax also treats all files as binary 8 bit files and will require word length to be set to 8, {{which is the most}} common setting.|$|R
25|$|This time, {{the ships}} {{that he was}} facing were in motion, {{and he had to}} contend with three monitors, not one. Tennessee was <b>so</b> <b>slow</b> that she became the target of ramming rather than her opponents. Several of the Federal sloops managed to ram, {{including}} Monongahela, which had been fitted with an iron shield on her bow just for this purpose. None of the collisions harmed the ironclad; in every case, the ramming vessel suffered more. Shots from Farragut's fleet bounced off Tennessees armor, but Tennessees fire was ineffective due to inferior powder and multiple misfires.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the initial}} {{analysis}} is correct, {{there is another}} effect that can happen, known as the overvoltage effect. Additional voltage is sometimes required, beyond the voltage predicted by the E°cell. This {{may be due to}} kinetic rather than thermodynamic considerations. In fact, it has been proven that the activation energy for the chloride ion is very low, hence favorable in kinetic terms. In other words, although the voltage applied is thermodynamically sufficient to drive electrolysis, the rate is <b>so</b> <b>slow</b> that to make the process proceed in a reasonable time frame, the voltage of the external source has to be increased (hence, overvoltage).|$|E
25|$|The {{composer}} subsequently scored Leone's {{other two}} Dollars Trilogy (or Man With No Name Trilogy) spaghetti westerns: For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). All three films starred the American actor Clint Eastwood as The Man With No Name and depicted Leone's own intense {{vision of the}} mythical West. Some of the music was written before the film, which was unusual. Leone's films were made like that because he wanted the music {{to be an important}} part of it; he kept the scenes longer because he did not want the music to end. According to Morricone this explains why the films are <b>so</b> <b>slow.</b>|$|E
50|$|So, the Nagel-Schreckenberg model {{includes}} {{the effect of}} cars getting in each other's way and <b>so</b> <b>slowing</b> each other down. The average velocity at this density is a little over 1, while at low density {{it is a little}} less than the maximum velocity of 5. It also shows that this is a collective phenomenon in which cars bunch up into traffic jams. When jamming occurs the distribution of cars along the road becomes highly non-uniform.|$|R

25|$|Once {{established}} in the first-team, Fulton performed consistently in the seasons between 1995 and 1998, where he averaged over 30 every year. 1996 also saw Fulton take his only first-class wicket; that of Oxford University batsman William Kendall, caught and bowled. Fulton's best run-scoring return was 954 runs in 1998, a season in which he hit his first double century. Playing against Yorkshire at Mote Park, Maidstone, Fulton posted 207 not out {{over the course of}} ten-and-a-half hours to save Kent from a heavy defeat. However, his innings was criticised by some, notably Clive Ellis of The Daily Telegraph, of being <b>so</b> <b>slow</b> that it prevented Kent from reaching a position to set a target.|$|E
25|$|In Chhattisgarh region, about 22% of net {{cropped area}} was under {{irrigation}} {{as compared to}} 36.5% in Madhya Pradesh in 1998–99, whereas the average national irrigation was about 40%. The irrigation is characterised by a high order of variability ranging from 1.6% in Bastar to 75.0% in Dhamtari. Based on an average growth trend in the irrigated area, about 0.43% additional area is brought under irrigation every year as compared to 1.89% in Madhya Pradesh and 1.0% in {{the country as a}} whole. Thus, irrigation has been growing at a very low rate in Chhattisgarh and the pace of irrigation is <b>so</b> <b>slow,</b> it would take about 122 years to reach the 75% level of net irrigated area in Chhattisgarh at the present rate of growth.|$|E
25|$|It {{fired the}} same {{projectiles}} as other 75mm pieces {{and had a}} cartridge case identical in length with that used in the Model 38. This case was longer than that used in the Model 41 mountain gun. This was necessary because the propelling charge used in Model 94 ammunition was less than that used in the ammunition for Model 38, and firing the latter ammunition from Model 94 would damage the gun. Lack of a howitzer trajectory and of varying charges increased the dead space for the Model 94 when it fired in mountainous terrain, and the counterrecoil {{was said to be}} <b>so</b> <b>slow</b> when the piece was fired at elevations above 30° that, rather than fire above that elevation, the battery displaced forward.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} NASCAR Cup Series race held since the deaths of Adam Petty and Kenny Irwin Jr. at this track. NASCAR used {{restrictor}} plates for this race as a result, {{in an effort to}} slow the top speed of the cars. However, cautions were so frequent and passing was <b>so</b> <b>slowed</b> that outside polesitter Jeff Burton led all 300 laps. This is the only race to date on a short track that had used restrictor plates. They were not used again after this race.|$|R

50|$|The first operation, {{which was}} the {{changing}} of tape speed, was his primary technique. The faster the tape is played, the higher the pitch and vice versa. Tape speed is measured by ips or inches per second. <b>So</b> <b>slowing</b> a recording by half (7-1/2-ips), lowers all pitches by an octave. Le Caine created a three-octave keyboard {{that allows him to}} choose different speeds. All the different pitches during Dripsody were achieved by changing the tape speed. He, sometime in the process of creating the keyboard, assembled the pitches into a pentatonic (five note) scale pattern.|$|R
25|$|Governor Beauharnois blamed Lignery for {{the failure}} to defeat the Foxes. He made serious accusations against him in his report to the ministry, and Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux, comte de Maurepas ordered him tried by a council of war. Lignery was accused of mismanaging supplies, of having been <b>so</b> <b>slow</b> in pursuit that the Foxes {{were able to make}} good their escape, of refusing to turn over command to his {{lieutenant}} in spite of having a debilitating illness, and of having abandoned large quantities of supplies at Michilimackinac on the return trip to Canada. After hearing witnesses and reviewing other evidence, the council of war unanimously dismissed the charges. Lignery died a short time later, in 1731 or 1732 (sources differ) in Trois-Rivières, where he had been named town major in 1728.|$|E
25|$|As an {{increasing}} number of customers asked for open standard solutions, such as personal computers (PC) and Unix, ND started developing products to meet the demand. A ND PC was developed, but sold poorly. The Unix variant Ndix was launched in 1985, but was only offered as a last resort to customers only interested in Unix systems. Use of Ndix required separate hardware. The software was developed by a third party and was <b>so</b> <b>slow</b> that the hardware was out of date by the time the software was completed. Many competitors licensed an existing variant of Unix, but ND chose develop its own. In addition, ND chose to not port is software to Unix, despite demands from customers for Sibas and Notis on the Unix platform. Sales were further reduced by ND's reluctance to pay software developers to port common programs to Ndix.|$|E
25|$|Warned by {{scouts and}} Arkansas unionists, Curtis rapidly {{concentrated}} his outlying units behind Little Sugar Creek by placing William Vandever's 700-man brigade who marched a remarkable 42 miles in 16 hours from Huntsville to Little Sugar Creek. But Curtis's right flank also {{suffered from the}} mistake of General Sigel, who sent a 360-man task force to the west, where they would miss {{the next three days}} of fighting. Sigel also withdrew a cavalry patrol from the road on which the Confederate army was advancing; however, Colonel Frederick Schaefer of the 2nd Missouri Infantry, on his own initiative, extended his patrols to cover the gap. When Van Dorn's advance guard blundered into one of these patrols near Elm Springs, the Federals were alerted. Still, Sigel was <b>so</b> <b>slow</b> in evacuating Bentonville that his rear guard was nearly snared by Van Dorn on March 6 as he advanced.|$|E
50|$|The nearly {{neutral theory}} of {{molecular}} evolution is {{a modification of}} the neutral theory of molecular evolution that accounts {{for the fact that}} not all mutations are either so deleterious such that they can be ignored, or else neutral. Slightly deleterious mutations are reliably purged only when their selection coefficient is greater than one divided by the effective population size. In larger populations, a higher proportion of mutations exceed this threshold for which genetic drift cannot overpower selection, leading to fewer fixation events and <b>so</b> <b>slower</b> molecular evolution.|$|R
