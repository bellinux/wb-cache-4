25|$|Convoy PQ 16 sailed from Reykjavík on 21 May 1942 {{and arrived}} at Murmansk on 30 May. Empire Baffin was {{attacked}} by German aircraft, which bombed her scoring several near misses. Her propeller, driveshaft and bearings were damaged and she developed a leak in her <b>stern</b> <b>gland.</b> The Chief Engineer had to spend three days and nights in the shaft tunnel tending to the bearings. Empire Baffin was repaired and returned to service.|$|E
50|$|Stave {{bearings}} {{have long}} been associated with ships and their propeller shafts. The bearing is suitable for slow speeds and high loads. When used on ships, the bearing is designed to run immersed in water, allowing its use outboard of the <b>stern</b> <b>gland</b> or stuffing box.|$|E

25|$|These advancements were {{coupled with}} a {{reputation}} for quality and reliability and this led to Penn becoming the major engine supplier to the Royal Navy as it made the transition from sail to steam. Penn was also responsible for introducing wood bearings for screw-propeller shafts which became vital to the worldwide use of steam-powered ships. This development of the lignum vitae stern bearing which enabled screw propeller ships to make oceanic voyages without wearing out their <b>stern</b> <b>glands</b> came in collaboration with Francis Pettit Smith. Other notable associations include his work on the application of superheated steam in marine engines.|$|R
25|$|In January 1945 {{an attempt}} was made to mount an attack on Vaenga Bay in the Kola Inlet. The hope was either to attack one of the convoys that stopped there to refuel and take on {{ammunition}} or to attack the Soviet battleship Arkhangelsk (HMS Royal Sovereign on loan to the USSR). As it happened neither the battleship nor a convoy were in the port {{at the time of the}} planned attack. The plan was for U-boats to carry the Bibers within range of the harbour. U-295, U-318 and U-716 set off from Harstad on 5 January with Bibers mounted on their casings. Vibrations from the U-boats’ engines caused the Bibers <b>stern</b> <b>glands</b> to leak allowing water to reach the machinery space and as a result the mission was abandoned.|$|R
500|$|Subsequently Philomel was {{deployed}} in the Red Sea and in the Persian Gulf {{for much of the}} remainder of the year. In December 1915 she sailed to Bombay for maintenance work but was back in the Persian Gulf in January 1916, continuing her patrolling. By the end of the year, her engines were giving trouble and her <b>stern</b> <b>glands</b> were worn out. A lengthy and costly refit was required and rather than incur this cost for a ship which was nearly {{at the end of her}} operational life, the Admiralty decided to gift her to New Zealand and dispatched her home to be paid off. She duly arrived in Wellington Harbour in March 1917. A large portion of her Royal Navy crew were returned to England to be assigned to other berths. Armament removed, Philomel was recommissioned [...] as a depot ship in Wellington, supporting minesweeping operations until May 1919.|$|R
50|$|Eight Mitsubishi G3M Nell {{twin-engine}} level {{bombers and}} 17 Nell torpedo bombers found the two capital ships without air cover in broad daylight. They scored {{just a single}} bomb hit on Repulse and a single torpedo hit on Prince of Wales. The torpedo struck where the outer port propeller shaft exited the hull and Prince of Wales took on 2400 st of water through a ruptured <b>stern</b> <b>gland.</b> The battleship listed 12 degrees to port preventing the starboard side 5.25 inch anti-aircraft guns from depressing low enough to deter more torpedo bombers.|$|E
5000|$|During 1977, amongst {{training}} {{exercises and}} maintenance dockings, Swan participated in SINDEX 77, a multinational {{exercise in the}} Indian Ocean. After training exercises in early 1978, Swan was forced to make an emergency docking in early March because of leakage on a <b>stern</b> <b>gland..</b> In early May, the warship was tasked with finding the yachtsman from Josephine II, which had run aground on Middleton Reef, but was unsuccessful (the sailor was later found at sea by another ship). Swan participated in several major fleet exercises during {{the latter part of}} the year. On 18 January 1979, while docked alongside the destroyer tender [...] at Garden Island, Swan was evacuated when a bomb threat was made against the tender. After port visits along the eastern Australian coast, the warship underwent a maintenance docking for the majority of the year.|$|E
