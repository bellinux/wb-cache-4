2500|$|In {{solid-state}} physics, a band gap, {{also called}} an energy gap or bandgap, is an energy range in a solid where no electron states can exist. In graphs {{of the electronic}} band structure of solids, the band gap generally refers to the energy difference (in electron volts) between {{the top of the}} valence band and the bottom of the conduction band in insulators and semiconductors. [...] It is the energy required to promote a valence electron bound to an atom to become a conduction electron, which is free to move within the crystal lattice and serve as a charge carrier to conduct electric current. [...] It is closely related to the HOMO/LUMO gap in chemistry. If the valence band is completely full and the conduction band is completely empty, then electrons cannot move in the solid; however, if some electrons transfer from the valence to the conduction band, then current can flow (see carrier generation and recombination). Therefore, the band gap is a major factor determining the electrical conductivity of a <b>solid.</b> <b>Substances</b> with large band gaps are generally insulators, those with smaller band gaps are semiconductors, while conductors either have very small band gaps or none, because the valence and conduction bands overlap.|$|E

60|$|So far Mr. Hitchcock, {{who seems}} {{perfectly}} master of Webster's unabridged quarto, and whose flowing style leads him into certain farther expatiations {{for which we}} have not room. We have since learned {{that the young man}} he speaks of was a sophomore, put under his care during a sentence of rustication from ---- College, where he had distinguished himself rather by physical experiments on the comparative power of resistance in window-glass to various <b>solid</b> <b>substances,</b> than in the more regular studies of the place. In answer to a letter of inquiry, the professor of Latin says, 'There was no harm in the boy that I know of beyond his loving mischief more than Latin, nor can I think of any spirits likely to possess him except those commonly called animal. He was certainly not remarkable for his Latinity, but I see nothing in the verses you enclose that would lead me to think them beyond his capacity, or the result of any special inspiration whether of beech or maple. Had that of birch been tried upon him earlier and more faithfully, the verses would perhaps have been better in quality and certainly in quantity.' This exact and thorough scholar then goes on to point out many false quantities and barbarisms. It is but fair to say, however, that the author, whoever he was, seems not to have been unaware of some of them himself, as is shown by a great many notes appended to the verses as we received them, and purporting to be by Scaliger, Bentley, and others,--among them the Esprit de Voltaire! These we have omitted as clearly meant to be humorous and altogether failing therein.|$|E

50|$|However, even {{at these}} large {{temperatures}} where gaseous nitrogen {{is able to}} store 7/6ths of the energy per atom of a monatomic gas (making it more efficient at storing energy on an atomic basis), it still only stores 7/12 ths of the maximal per-atom heat capacity of a solid, meaning it {{is not nearly as}} efficient at storing thermal energy on an atomic basis, as <b>solid</b> <b>substances</b> can be. This is typical of gases, and results because many of the potential bonds which might be storing potential energy in gaseous nitrogen (as opposed to solid nitrogen) are lacking, because only one of the spatial dimensions for each nitrogen atom offers a bond into which potential energy can be stored without increasing the kinetic energy of the atom. In general, solids are most efficient, on an atomic basis, at storing thermal energy (that is, they have the highest per-atom or per-mole-of-atoms heat capacity).|$|E
