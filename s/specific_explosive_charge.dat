30|$|The {{performance}} of drilling and blasting (rock fragmentation) {{is measured by}} fragmented space and particle size distribution of fragmented material. The particle size distribution {{is a function of}} the blast design and the <b>specific</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> of each hole (Ouchterlony et al. 2017). Blasting design parameters (such as bench height, burden, spacing, explosive charge, etc.) affect the rock fragmentation size. Particle size of blasted material (1) increases if the burden to hole diameter ratio increases, (2) decreases if the spacing to burden ratio increases, (3) increases if stemming length to burden ratio increases, (4) decreases with the increase in explosive charge, and (5) decreases if bench height to burden ratio increases (Singh et al. 2016). The effect of drilling and blasting geometry on particle size distribution can be estimated by using mathematical modelling (Kecojevic and Komljenovic 2007).|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} characterise a blast, the {{researcher}} and design engineer {{need to have}} some idea of the effects an explosive blast has on a structure. There are a number of ways to obtain measurements of the destruction ability of such an explosion. One way of obtaining the impulse was recently developed at CSIR, namely the Scientifically Instrumented Impulse Measuring Apparatus. This measuring device is installed at Paardefontein shooting range and it records the total force of an explosive charge of mass up to 8 kg TNT by means of a damped harmonic oscillator. This is integrated over time to yield the impulse associated with the <b>specific</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>charge,</b> standoff distance and exposed area to the charge. In this paper the development of the apparatus and subsequent measurement of the (mechanical) impulse due to an explosion will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of lightweight blast mitigating materials to protect commercial aircraft structures against internal blast loading. Thin clamped aluminum test panels with rivet-attached frame and stringer stiffeners were used to represent {{a portion of the}} fuselage structure of a commercial aircraft. These reinforced test panels were pre-pressurized before blast loading to simulate typical in-flight loads experienced by a commercial aircraft due to cabin pressurization. Bare spherical explosive charges of C 4 were then detonated at a fixed distance from the outer surface of these pre-pressurized plates. A high-speed camera was used to determine the mechanism and time scale of failure propagation in the reinforced panels. Eleven unique combinations of blast mitigating linings were used in the testing. The <b>specific</b> <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> mass and standoff distance selected for this study was found to produce massive damage in unprotected test panels. Several tests with blast mitigating liners also showed complete destruction of the test panel, indicating the inadequacy of these protective compositions. In the end, it was determined that a blast liner comprised of a rigid outer layer, such as aluminum, in combination with an elastomeric backing layer was successful in preventing the rupture of the reinforced test panel. This material combination was found to be effective over several tests and with slight variations of the specific rigid and flexible materials used...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Explosive</b> <b>specific</b> <b>charge</b> {{is the key}} to {{the high}} level of casting blast. In order to study how the <b>explosive</b> <b>specific</b> <b>charge</b> affects the high bench cast blasting, {{theoretical}} analysis and experimental study were used in the Hei Dai-gou open pit cast blasting. Experimental study shows that: under the same engineering geological conditions and blasting parameters, the throw distance increases as the average <b>explosives</b> <b>specific</b> <b>charge</b> increases, and this trend slows down gradually. Settlement muck-pile height increases as <b>explosives</b> <b>specific</b> <b>charge</b> increases, and then gently muck-pile shape tends to be more conducive to the work platform dragline flat-field and inverted reactor efficiency. When q> 0. 65 kg/m 3, the cast percentage can reach more than 30 %, as 0. 67 kg/...|$|R

50|$|A party popper is {{an object}} {{commonly}} used at parties. It emits a loud popping noise {{by means of}} a small friction-actuated <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> that is emitted by pulling a string. The <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> comes from a very small amount of Armstrong's mixture (a highly sensitive explosive) in the neck of the bottle-like shape. In some party poppers the <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> is replaced by compressed air. In party poppers with an <b>explosive</b> <b>charge,</b> there are less than 0.25 gr g of explosive. The streamers are non flammable for safe use. The charge or compressed air blows out some confetti or streamers and emits a popping sound. The charge is often composed of red phosphorus and strong oxidizer, such as potassium chlorate and potassium perchlorate.|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} effect of blasting-induced {{vibration}} on ground buildings when tunnel undercrossing a village, a blasting vibration trial {{was carried out in}} Beizhuang tunnel in Henan Province, China. The safety blasting distance and reasonable <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> were pre-estimated according to empirical formula. The attenuation of ground vibration velocity was simulated using a 3 D numerical model. Less <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> and longer distance to blasting source would result in lower ground vibration. When designed <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> was 54 kg, the safe distance was 42. 26 m. While the distance between building and blasting source was about 37 m, the maximum <b>explosive</b> <b>charge</b> was 36. 24 kg. The numerical results showed that the significantly horizontal affect region of blasting vibration was within 50 m to blasting source. Accordingly, effective vibration control is necessary to avoid disturbing human daily life during tunneling...|$|R

40|$|This paper probed {{into the}} whole height bench cast {{blasting}} process and described the influence factors from 3 major perspectives: natural geological, blasting scheming and factitious ones, and selected the throwing rate which was generally accepted in the cast blasting field to assess the blasting performance. Then a novel GA-SVM model was constructed to analyze the real collected explosion data from open pit mining, and verified in a certain open-pit. Also the MIV method was employed to analyze the influence factor at each input factor. The study indicate that: (1) the presented GA-SVM model performs more robust and accurate than other artificial intelligence models such as BP, RBF, GRNN and GA-BP, which has a more stable prediction accuracy of 83. 75 %. Moreover, due to the ubiquitous paradigm of the presented approach, it provides a single, unified approach to evaluating other blasting performance {{factors such as the}} longest thrown distance and loose coefficient etc; (2) for this certain open pit which maintains a steady lithological character and design parameters, the bench height, <b>explosive</b> <b>specific</b> <b>charge</b> possess a positive correlation coefficient with the throwing rate, while line of least resistance, the slope angle and the profile width perform the opposite...|$|R
