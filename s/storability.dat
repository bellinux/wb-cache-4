The SERT-1 flight was followed up by the SERT-2 flight in 1970. Mercury and caesium were preferred propellants for ion engines until Hughes Research Laboratory performed studies finding xenon gas to be a suitable replacement. Xenon is now the preferred propellant for ion engines as it has a high molecular weight, little or no reactivity due to its noble gas nature, and has a high liquid density under mild cryogenic storage.|$|E

5000|$|Monopropellants such as {{hydrogen}} peroxide, hydrazine, and {{nitrous oxide}} are primarily used for attitude control and spacecraft station-keeping where their long-term <b>storability,</b> simplicity of use, {{and ability to}} provide the tiny impulses needed, outweighs their lower specific impulse as compared to bipropellants.

50|$|A lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) {{is a type}} of {{chemical}} compound derived from a phosphatidylethanolamine, which is typical of cell membranes. LPE results from partial hydrolysis of phosphatidylethanolamine, which removes one of the fatty acid groups. The hydrolysis is generally the result of the enzymatic action of phospholipase A2. LPE can be used in agricultural use to regulate plant growth such as color increase, sugar content increase, plant health increase, and <b>storability</b> increase without side effect.|$|E
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} of LH2/LOX engines is the low density and low temperature of liquid hydrogen, which means bigger and insulated and thus heavier fuel tanks are needed. This increases the rocket's structural mass which reduces its delta-v significantly. Another disadvantage is the poor <b>storability</b> of LH2/LOX-powered rockets: Due {{to the constant}} hydrogen boil-off, the rocket can only be fueled shortly before launch, which makes cryogenic engines unsuitable for ICBMs and other rocket applications {{with the need for}} short launch preparations.|$|E
50|$|English noble {{varieties}} are Fuggle, East Kent Goldings and Goldings. They are characterized through analysis {{as having an}} alpha:beta ratio of 1:1, low alpha-acid levels (2-5%) with a low cohumulone content, low myrcene in the hop oil, high humulene in the oil, a ratio of humulene:caryophyllene above three, and poor <b>storability</b> resulting in them being more prone to oxidation. In reality, this means they have a relatively consistent bittering potential as they age, due to beta-acid oxidation, and a flavour that improves as they age during periods of poor storage.|$|E
50|$|Steinbier is not mashed in kettles, but in wooden tubs. Its name {{is derived}} from the hot stones that were put into the mashing tubs to achieve the {{required}} temperature for production. Due to the contact of the glowing, hot stones - often heated directly in the fire - with the malt, the resulting beer has a taste of caramel and soot. This was a traditional brewing process; top-fermenting yeasts and a taste of fruity ester were usual and there was no emphasis on long term <b>storability.</b> Steinbier was usually not filtered.|$|E
5000|$|Desiccation {{tolerance}} in maturing seeds {{involves the}} accumulation of non-reducing galactosyl sucrose oligosaccharides such as stachyose and raffinose. These galactosyl sucrose oligosaccharides cause flatulence in animals and human beings [...] because human beings {{do not have the}} enzyme, α-galactosidase to cleave the α-galactosyl linkage. Consequently, the intact galactosyl sucrose oligosaccharide is not absorbed by the digestive tract and the bacteria in the colon use it as a substrate that results in gas formation. As a result of the relationship found between the oligosaccharides and flatulence, the Protein Advisory Group of the United Nations has recommended that the elimination of flatulence associated with the consumption of foods be one of the research priorities. However, Obendorf found that {{the accumulation of}} the flatulence-producing oligosaccharides is required for seed germinability and seed desiccation tolerance. Thus the elimination of the flatulence-producing oligosaccharides from seeds would result in a deterioration of the crop that produces them. According to Obendorf, Breeding seed plants for quality embryos emphasizes elimination of flatulence-producing oligosaccharides. Before this effort proceeds too far, we need to determine if the flatulence-producing maturation sugars are required for desiccation tolerance and <b>storability</b> of seed germplasm, the threshold level required, and if biosynthesis of the stachyose series oligosaccharides and/or oligogalactocyclitols can be regulated genetically and biochemically in parallel with altered desiccation tolerance and <b>storability</b> of seed germplasm.|$|E

In principle there is the possibility to store energy electrically, mechanically or chemically. Another trend-setting technology is lithium-based electrochemical storage, which can be used in electric vehicles or as an option to control the power grid. The German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology realized the significance of this topic and established an initiative with the aim to promote technological breakthroughs and support the rapid introduction of new energy storage.|$|E
50|$|Clear colorless bottles have {{recently}} become popular with white wine producers in many countries, including Greece, Canada and New Zealand. Dark-colored bottles are {{most commonly used}} for red wines, but many white wines also still come in dark green bottles. The main reason for using colored or tinted glass is that natural sunlight can break down desirable antioxidants such as vitamin c and tannins in a wine over time, which affects <b>storability</b> and can cause a wine to prematurely oxidise. Dark glass can prevent oxidation and increase storage life. It is therefore mostly ready-to-drink white wines with a short anticipated storage lifespan which are bottled in clear colorless bottles.|$|E
5000|$|The {{preferred}} {{procedure is}} {{to freeze the}} freshly cold-pressed juice instantly for preservation. The quality of the juice depends on immediate freezing. The frozen juice can be freeze-dried into a storable powder. Freezing and freeze-drying stabilize the natural form of the cannabinoids as cannabinoid-acids. Another procedure is pasteurization. The ultra-heat-treatment will [...] "activate" [...] the cannabinoids by separating the acid part from the natural cannabinoids. Increasing shelf life of hemp juice can also be achieved by fermentation, using various procedures, preferably by adding yeast/yeast extract and sugar. Using salt is a proven procedure to achieve <b>storability</b> in foods. With regard to hemp juice {{this can be done}} by mixing salt with fresh hemp juice, which leads to an easily usable product: [...] "hemp salt".|$|E

The rocket was fueled with Devil's Venom — a hypergolic pairing of UDMH as fuel and a saturated solution of dinitrogen tetroxide in nitric acid as the oxidizer — which was used {{because of the high}} boiling temperatures and hence <b>storability</b> of the fuel and oxidizer, despite being extremely corrosive and toxic. These risks were accounted for in the safety requirements of the launch procedures, but Nedelin's insistence on performing tests before November 7 (anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution) resulted in extreme schedule pressure, with numerous safety procedures being ignored in order to save time.|$|E

40|$|<b>Storability</b> of shelled corn {{was defined}} as the {{fraction}} of remaining allowable storage time, an assessment of spoilage potential. Corn from three years (1986, 1991, and 1992) was harvested, dried, and subsequently stored in small bins. Samples taken at harvest and samples taken after various periods of bin storage (up to 77 months) were subjected to three primary tests: (1) accelerated storage and carbon dioxide evolution, (2) electrolyte leakage, and (3) near-infrared spectroscopy. The initial (t 3 ̆c 72 h) slopes (SLOPE 72) of carbon dioxide evolution rate curves were related to <b>storability</b> (r = 0. 82), as measured by cumulative carbon dioxide evolution at 200 hours. The correlation between SLOPE 72 and <b>storability</b> was corroborated by mold assays before and after carbon dioxide tests. SLOPE 72 was subsequently used to evaluate the effects of the following factors on storability: (1) hybrid, (2) drying method, (3) postharvest fungicide, and (4) previous storage history. Differences in <b>storability,</b> attributable to hybrid, were measurable and significant both at harvest and after periods of bin storage (up to 56 months). Corn dried by high-temperature (T = 95 ∘C) batch crossflow drying had significantly lower <b>storability</b> (i. e., greater SLOPE 72), than did the same hybrid dried by low-temperature (ambient air) drying. Corn treated with Iprodione, a postharvest fungicide, had greater <b>storability</b> than did untreated controls, both after drying and after 9 months of bin storage. Previous storage history (moisture and time) affected subsequent <b>storability</b> (i. e., SLOPE 72). Storage for longer periods, given the same moisture, resulted in lower subsequent <b>storability,</b> and storage at higher moisture, given the same time period, also resulted in lower subsequent <b>storability.</b> In electrolyte leakage tests, 100 g of seeds were soaked in deionized water. The correlation between the conductivity after 10 minutes (COND 10) and SLOPE 72 was r = 0. 79. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to compare near-infrared transmittance (whole grain) and reflectance (ground grain), over a range of wavelengths, to SLOPE 72. The best model (R 2 = 0. 78) expressed SLOPE 72 as a function of three independent variables: COND 10 and the second derivatives of log(1 /R) at 1668 and 2288 nm. Differences in <b>storability</b> may, therefore, be detectable by these two rapid test procedures. ...|$|E
40|$|Oilly seeds, such {{as those}} of {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus L.), have short <b>storability</b> (3 - 4 months in room condition) due to oxidative stress during storage. The objective of this research was to determine whether prestorage seed invigoration by antioxidants, could improve <b>storability</b> of sunflower seeds. The research was performed using fresh harvested seeds. Prestorage seed invigorations were conducted by matriconditioning with water or antioxidants solution i. e. 4. 17 % curcumin or 100 and 150 ppm ascorbic acid. The seeds were stored for four months at room condition (28 - 29 °C and 62 - 79 % relative humidity). Observations were conducted monthly. Experiment was arranged in split plot design. The result showed that all prestorage seed invigoration treatments were not effective to enhance <b>storability</b> of sunflower seeds compared to control. Inefficiency exogenous antioxidants was probably due to highly endogenous antioxidants activity during storage. This was indicated by the slow deterioration rate of control seeds, or due to high concentration of curcumin which was actually potential to enhance <b>storability</b> of sunflower seeds.

40|$|Various {{forms of}} {{accelerated}} ageing tests {{have been used}} to evaluate <b>storability</b> of seed lots but very little work has been done on how these tests correlate or relate well with ambient storage and their effectiveness in selecting for seed <b>storability.</b> In this study, hundred seeds each from three soybean genotypes were subjected to three accelerated ageing tests by soaking the seeds in 20 % ethanol solution for two hours, in 20 % methanol solution for two hours or in 75 °C hot water for seventy seconds. The same quantity of seeds was stored on laboratory wooden shelves for a period of four months at a temperature range of 22 - 25 °C and 30 - 35 % relative humidity. Germination percentage of seeds from these four categories revealed that the ethanol solution predicted seed <b>storability</b> more than hot water and methanol treatments. In another experiment, seeds from individual M 2 plants were screened either by using the ethanol test or by storing threshed and unthreshed seeds at a temperature range of 22 - 25 °C and relative humidity of 30 - 35 % for a period of four months.

Twelve onion cultivars with different degrees of <b>storability</b> were selected from preliminary experiments. Bulbs of selected cultivars were grown and stored for 3 months under ambient conditions. Observations were made on disease incidence at harvest, percentage diseased bulbs, and storage disease incidence of bacterial soft rot [BR (Pseudomonas gladioli pv. alliicola Burkholder) ], black mold [BM (Aspergillus niger Tiegh.) ], and fusarium basal rot (Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend. :Fr. f. sp. cepae) after 3 months of storage. Data on bulb characteristics such as bulb fresh weight (FW), dry matter (DM) content, total soluble solids (TSS), and pyruvic acid content were recorded at harvest. Mean storage losses of cultivars ranged from 21 % to 99 % over 3 years. Diseases were the major causes of storage losses, with BR and BM being the most predominant. Performance of most traits (including storage losses) was significantly influenced by year (Y), cultivar (G), and Y x G interaction. Heavy rainfall during bulb development in 1997 {{may have contributed to}} higher disease incidence at harvest, higher percentage of diseased bulbs during storage, and lower DM, and TSS of the cultivars. Cultivars with good <b>storability,</b> such as 'Red Pinoy' and 'Serrana', were less sensitive to stressful environments and high disease pressure.

By performing quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in a recombinant inbred line population, we found one major QTL responsible for the practically monogenic segregation of seed stachyose content. This locus also affected the content of the two other OSs, sucrose, and raffinose. Two candidate genes encoding respectively for galactinol synthase and raffinose synthase were located within the genomic region around this major QTL. In addition, three smaller-effect QTL were identified, each one specifically affecting the content of an individual OS. Seed <b>storability</b> was analyzed in the same recombinant inbred line population by measuring viability (germination) under two different seed aging assays: after natural aging during 4 years of dry storage at room temperature and after artificial aging induced by a controlled deterioration test.

The {{study was conducted in}} three stages, namely: 1) desk study, 2) seed storage experiment, 3) development of seed storage model, simulation and verification of the model. The second stage of the experiment consisted of soybean seed storing and germination testing using completely randomized design. Treatments were three initial moisture content (7 - 8 %, 9 - 10 % and 11 - 12 %) and four varieties of soybean (Anjasmoro, Wilis, Detam- 1 and Detam- 2). The results showed that the seed behaviour during storage period were affected by initial seed moisture content, initial viability, varieties and environmental condition. Therefore, seed moisture content, initial viability and varieties may be used as input model. Moisture content, integreting seed respiration, electric conductivity and seed <b>storability</b> vigor (VDSDB) were as model output. Simulation of Seed <b>Storability</b> Vigor Prediction Model with Model Construction Layer-Stella (MCLS) using relative humidity (RH), temperature, seed permeability, initial moisture content and initial viability as input model could logically predict the seed moisture content and seed <b>storability</b> vigor (VDSDB) ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} {{the influence of the}} variety, dosage, form and the terms of sulfur fertilization in the production of onions. Without otherwise not altered amounts of other nutrients was evaluated the effect of half, whole and halved the dose of elemental sulfur and sulfate forms on yield, <b>storability,</b> sulfur and nitrate in onions. Issues was solved through field experiment in 2014, in Loděnice near Mor. Krumlov. Yield and <b>storability</b> of onions were statistically significantly affected by the dose and form of sulfur and varieties of onion. Sulfur fertilization had a statistically signifi-cant effect on the nitrate content and ratio of nitrogen and sulfur contained in onions. The results shows us, that the higher dose of sulfur fertilization was more effective than the lower dose of sulfur...|$|E
