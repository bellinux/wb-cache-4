5|$|The <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> grew {{to become}} Banagher, {{originated}} at a ford {{on the east}} bank of the River Shannon. The river banks and surrounding countryside were flood-free all year round. Travellers intending to cross the Shannon converged on this point along tracks which were the forerunners of the modern roads, and a community grew at this crossing point.|$|E
5|$|Although Mazariegos {{had managed}} to {{establish}} his new provincial capital without armed conflict, excessive Spanish demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion. In August 1528, Mazariegos replaced the existing encomenderos with his friends and allies; the natives, seeing the Spanish isolated and witnessing the hostility between the original and newly arrived settlers, took this opportunity to rebel and refused to supply their new masters. Zinacantán was the only indigenous <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> remained loyal to the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|Deserted {{for about}} 30 years, {{the town was}} {{repopulated}} by Eastern Orthodox Bulgarians, beginning in the 1720s. It was following this new <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> Chiprovtsi became a major centre of the Bulgarian carpet industry. Other traditional industries have been stock breeding, agriculture and fur trade. Today, Chiprovtsi municipality experiences a declining population and above-average unemployment. However, large-scale investment in the extraction of the local fluorite deposits {{and the development of}} alternative tourism help to sustain the economy.|$|E

5|$|George mainly {{lived in}} Great Britain after 1714 though he visited {{his home in}} Hanover in 1716, 1719, 1720, 1723 and 1725; in total George spent about one fifth of his reign as King in Germany. A clause in the Act of <b>Settlement</b> <b>that</b> forbade the British monarch from leaving the country without Parliament's {{permission}} was unanimously repealed in 1716. During all but {{the first of the}} King's absences power was vested in a Regency Council rather than his son, George Augustus, Prince of Wales.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 Liverpool Corporation {{attempted}} {{to acquire the}} entire area to safeguard its water supply, and proposed demolishing the entire village. The Act of Parliament known as the Liverpool Corporation Act 1902 protected some buildings but others were left vulnerable. The Act allowed the corporation to acquire by compulsory purchase properties in {{the west of the}} village, including the Black-a-Moors Head public house (known locally as the 'Black Lad') and New Hall, which were demolished between 1902 and 1905. The result was the small <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> has remained largely unchanged since then.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, after {{returning}} from military service in Germany, Banks married his first wife Mollye Ector. He proposed {{to her in a}} letter from Germany. Although he filed for divorce two years later, the couple briefly reconciled in early 1959. By that summer, they agreed on a divorce <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> would pay $65,000 to Ector in lieu of alimony. Shortly thereafter, Banks eloped with Eloyce Johnson. The couple had twin sons within a year and a daughter four years after that. Ector filed suit against Banks in 1963 for failure to make payments on a life insurance policy agreed upon in their divorce settlement.|$|E

5|$|In {{the centuries}} {{following}} Rome's excursions into Scottish territory Orkney was, {{at least for}} a time, part of the Pictish kingdom. Very {{little is known about the}} Pictish Orcadians, the main archaeological relics being symbol stones. One of the best examples is located on the Brough of Birsay; it shows 3 warriors with spears and sword scabbards combined with traditional Pictish symbols. This small tidal island has a long history of <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> continued into the Norse period.|$|E
5|$|Mari is not {{considered}} a small <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> later grew, but rather a new city that was purposely founded during the Mesopotamian Early Dynastic period I c. 2900 BC, to control the waterways of the Euphrates trade routes that connect the Levant with the Sumerian south. The city was built about 1 to 2 kilometers away from the Euphrates river {{to protect it from}} floods, and was connected to the river by an artificial canal that was between 7 and 10 kilometers long depending on which old meander it used to be attached with, which is hard to identify today.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 1922, 400,000 {{railroad}} workers went on strike. Harding {{proposed a}} <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> made some concessions, but management objected. Attorney General Daugherty convinced Judge James H. Wilkerson {{to issue a}} sweeping injunction {{to break up the}} strike. Although there was public support for the Wilkerson injunction, Harding felt it went too far, and had Daugherty and Wilkerson amend it. The injunction succeeded in ending the strike; however, tensions remained high between railroad workers and management for years.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} several days, more Texian {{settlers}} joined the group at La Bahía. Many of them were from Refugio, a sprawling <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> was furthest from Matagorda. Historian Hobart Huson speculates that these men were the last to receive word of the planned attack. Austin ordered that 100men remain at Goliad, {{under the command of}} Dimmitt, while the rest should join the Texian Army in marching on Cos's troops in Béxar. Collinsworth returned to Matagorda to recruit additional soldiers, but on October 14 the remaining Texians at Goliad began the march towards Béxar.|$|E
5|$|Skaði also {{included}} in her terms of <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> the gods must do something she thought {{impossible for them to}} do: make her laugh. To do so, Loki tied one end of a cord around the beard of a nanny goat and the other end around his testicles. The goat and Loki drew one another back and forth, both squealing loudly. Loki dropped into Skaði's lap, and Skaði laughed, completing this part of her atonement. Finally, in compensation to Skaði, Odin took Þjazi's eyes, plunged them into the sky, and from the eyes made two stars.|$|E
5|$|The RIRA's {{objective}} is a united Ireland by forcing {{the end of}} British sovereignty over Northern Ireland {{through the use of}} physical force. The organisation rejects the Mitchell Principles and the Good Friday Agreement, comparing the latter to the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty which resulted in the partition of Ireland. The organisation aims to uphold an uncompromising form of Irish republicanism and opposes any political <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> falls short of Irish unity and independence.|$|E

5|$|The main {{enemies of}} Spain {{at the time}} were the English and the Dutch. They, however were not the only enemies that Spain faced in the Caribbean during this period. On October 11, 1528, the French sacked and burned the {{settlement}} of San Germán during an attempt to capture the island, destroying many of the island's first settlements—including Guánica, Sotomayor, Daguao and Loiza—before the local militia forced them to retreat. The only <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> remained was San Juan.|$|E
5|$|The {{translation}} of the myth of Myrrha as it appeared in Ovid's Metamorphoses is suggested as being {{a critique of the}} political <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> followed the Glorious Revolution. The wife of the leader of this revolution, William of Orange, was Mary, daughter of James II. Mary and William were crowned king and queen of England in 1689, and because Dryden was deeply sympathetic to James he lost his public offices and fell into political disfavor under the new reign. Dryden turned to translation and infused these translations with political satire in response - the myth of Myrrha being one of these translations.|$|E
5|$|Although Mazariegos {{had managed}} to {{establish}} his new provincial capital without armed conflict, excessive Spanish demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion. The colonists demanded that the Indians supply them with food, wood for construction and firewood, and that they build new houses for the Spanish. In addition, pigs had been introduced by the Spanish and were causing great damage to the natives' maize fields. In August 1528, Mazariegos replaced the existing encomenderos with his friends and allies; the natives, seeing the Spanish isolated and witnessing the hostility between the original and newly arrived settlers, took this opportunity to rebel and refused to supply their new masters. Zinacantán was the only indigenous <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> remained loyal to the Spanish.|$|E

5|$|Cabeza de Vaca {{is thought}} to have been the first European to sight the bay in the early 16th century, {{evidenced}} by the descriptions in his logs that match the detail of the area. In 1766, Spaniard Diego Ortiz Parrilla {{is believed to be the}} first European to explore the bay. He named it Santo Domingo (Saint Dominic), but it was later changed to Copano, after the port of Copano was officially opened in 1785 on the northwestern shore. The port later served as a strategically important locale during the Texas Revolution and the American Civil War, and was the site of a <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> is now completely abandoned. The town of St. Mary's of Aransas was founded southwest of Copano and thrived as a port and wood mart, until numerous shipwrecks caused by the bay's hidden reefs concluded its use in 1875. Like Copano, it is now abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Celebrations {{to honor}} the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's first trans-Atlantic voyage were held in several countries; Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie, Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf, and Kaiser Franz Joseph I {{represented}} Austria-Hungary during the ceremonies in Genoa, Italy, Columbus's birthplace. During the 1893 fleet maneuvers, Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie was mobilized to train alongside the ironclads Kronprinz Erzherzog Rudolf, , , and , among other vessels. Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie took part in an international naval demonstration off Crete in 1897 {{during a period of}} tension between Greece and the Ottoman Empire that culminated in the Greco-Turkish War. The Austro-Hungarian contingent, which also included the armored cruiser , and the torpedo cruisers , , and , three destroyers, and eight torpedo boats, was the third largest squadron {{to take part in the}} demonstration, after the British and Italian fleets. Austria-Hungary, displeased with the <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> left Crete with a Greek ruler but nominally under Turkish control, withdrew its ships in March 1898, before the other members of the international fleet.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{the archaeologists}} {{returned}} {{to search for}} the <b>settlement</b> <b>that</b> they believed was associated with the graves. There are examples elsewhere, such as at Garton Green Lane Crossing in the Yorkshire Wolds, of 7th-century graves associated with prehistoric monuments, and it was initially thought that the Street House graves were a similar example. However, the excavation uncovered another twelve graves. It was realised that the cemetery was far larger than first thought, so the following year an archaeological survey of the entire site was attempted. A total of 109 graves was found {{by the end of the}} 2007 dig, forming a complex monument laid out in a unique square fashion around a central mound, a bed burial and a building that had possibly served as a mortuary.|$|E
