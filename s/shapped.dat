40|$|Abstract Introduction One of {{the most}} common {{treatments}} of head and neck cancer patients is radiotherapy, a treatment method which uses ionizing radiation beam and destroys tumor cells, minimizing damage to neighbor cells. Purpose To evaluate the bond strength of a conventional adhesive system in irradiated teeth. Method 24 third human molars, 12 of which were randomly exposed to radiation and prepared from the removal of occlusal enamel, then exposed to a flat dentine surface. The adhesive system Stae was applied according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Next, two 2 mm increments of resin were implemented. The samples were hemi sectioned specimens, originating <b>shapped</b> toothpick. To evaluate the bond strength, a micro tensile test was done with 500 N load and speed of 0. 5 mm/minute. Result There was no statistically significant difference between the bond strength of teeth which were or were not exposed to radiation and which used a conventional adhesive system. Conclusion Although the radiation doses applied may cause some alterations in microscopic range in dental tissues, it can be concluded that these alterations do not influence in the bond strength in dentin of irradiated teeth...|$|E

40|$|A {{major problem}} related to chronic health is patients’ “compliance” with new {{lifestyle}} changes, medical prescriptions, recommendations, or restrictions. Heart-failure and hemodialysis patients are usually placed on fluid restrictions {{due to their}} hemodynamic status. A holistic approach to managing fluid imbalance will incorporate the monitoring of salt-water intake, body-fluid retention, and fluid excretion {{in order to provide}} effective intervention at an early stage. Such an approach creates a need to develop a smart device that can monitor the drinking activities of the patient. This paper employs an empirical approach to infer the real water level in a conically <b>shapped</b> glass and the volume difference due to changes in water level. The method uses a low-resolution miniaturized camera to obtain images using an Arduino microcontroller. The images are processed in MATLAB. Conventional segmentation techniques (such as a Sobel filter to obtain a binary image) are applied to extract the level gradient, and an ellipsoidal fitting helps to estimate the size of the cup. The fitting (using least-squares criterion) between derived measurements in pixel and the real measurements shows a low covariance between the estimated measurement and the mean. The correlation between the estimated results to ground truth produced a variation of 3 % from the mean...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} Chiloe island (Chile) in a period between late autumn and early summer in 1997. From a total of 167 {{specimens}} histologically analysed, there were two oysters with a haemocytic hyperplasic response in the mantle, gills and digestive gland. The parasited haemocytes contain in the citoplasm a variable number of spherically <b>shapped</b> para-sites similar to the protozoan Bonamia. The genus Bonamia has been described in Tiostrea chilensis from aquaculture farms in New Zealand, which indicates the susceptibility of the Chilean oyster to this parasite. In the present study, an haemocytic parasito-sis is histopathologically described from T. chilensis specimens cultivated in the area sur-rounding Chiloe, Chile. Materials and Methods The 167 specimens of T. chilensis utilized in this study were collected seasonally from late autum in 1996 (June) until the summer 1997 (January). The oysters were obtained from five aquaculture centres located in the south of Chile (Fig. 1), and driven to the laboratory for their analysis. Tissues samples of mantle, digestive gland and gills from each specimen used for the his-tological study were fixed with 10 % (v/v) neutral-buffered-formalin. They were dehy-drated in a series of increasing alcohol con-centrations, cleared in xylene, and embebed in paraffin. Cuts of 5 µm were obtained, stained with hematoxylin-eosin and observed by ligth microscopy at 1400 X magnification...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{spread of}} {{technological}} innovation {{along with the}} sophistication of the ICT gadgets have <b>shapped</b> and transformed the realm of learning and teaching including in that of English Language. Alongside, ICT has {{become more and more}} inextricable part of human businesses and put a higher level of demand for technological literacy in the part of English learners {{in order for them to}} be convident in the digital era membership and participation. This study surveyed 400 high school students as regards: (a) their ICT gadgets perceived ownership; (b) their day-to-day outside and in-school use and; (c) their activities using ICT gadgets for English learning. Findings from the descriptive analyses of the mixed-method study, disclose the positive perception about the gadget ownership. Interestingly, the current study also discovers that there has been a mismatch between the positively perceived ownership of the ICT gadgets and the real day-to-day use as facilitative media for learning, in particular as a useful aids for English language learning. Focusing on the result discussion, issues with regard to discrepancies in the provision of infrastructures and the lack of the support system by school institutions emerge from the FGD analysis highlighting the importance for all decision makers, school institutions, and teachers to consciously start doing something about it. By highlighting the pivotal role of the technology, the researcher suggested a real action for responding to the call for a change in both policy makers and institutonal levels to start integrating the technology into the school curricul...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (<b>SHAP)</b> {{evaluates the}} {{functionality}} of normal, injured or prosthetic hands. The {{aim was to}} evaluate the learning effects of <b>SHAP</b> tasks and {{the appropriateness of the}} time limits applied per task in novice prosthetic users. Methods: Right-handed unimpaired volunteers (n= 24, mean age 21. 8 years) completed 8 <b>SHAP</b> sessions over 5 consecutive days using a prosthetic simulator. The execution times of <b>SHAP</b> tasks were transformed into 6 prehensile patterns, the functionality profile, and the index of function, a general functionality score. Learning effects in task times were analysed using multilevel analysis. Results: Learning effects occurred in all <b>SHAP</b> tasks.
