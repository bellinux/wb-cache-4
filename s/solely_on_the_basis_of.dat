Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats.; this was especially the case with policy making positions. While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the claim of ageism made against the National Institute for Health & Clinical Excellence and like organisations, and to {{identify}} circumstances under which ageist discrimination might arise. We adopt a broad definition of ageism as representing any discrimination against individuals or groups of individuals <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> that they have shorter life expectancy than others. A simple model of NICE?s decision making process is developed which demonstrates that NICE?s recommendations do not inherently discriminate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of life expectancy per se but that scope for discrimination may arise in the case of specific technologies having identifiable characteristics. Such discrimination may favour patients with either longer or shorter life expectancy. It is shown that NICE?s policies, procedures and the context in which NICE makes its decisions not only reduce the scope for discriminatory recommendations but also – in the case of “end of life” treatments – increase the likelihood that NICE?s recommendations favour those with shorter, rather than longer, life expectancy. ...|$|R
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that within choral music, singers voices are divided <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> vocal range. Choral music most {{commonly}} divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB).

Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.|$|E

5000|$|Laskin {{contended that}} Justice Ritchie's own opinion in Drybones, the {{majority}} opinion, made it explicitly {{clear that a}} denial of a respondent's equality before the law was apparent because a distinction had been made <b>solely</b> <b>on</b> account of <b>the</b> respondent's race.
