This is accomplished {{through the use of a}} large <b>shunting</b> <b>capacitor.</b> The result is energy level spacings that are approximately independent of offset charge. Planar on-chip transmon qubits have T1 coherence times ~ 30 μs to 40 μs. By replacing the superconducting transmission line cavity with a three-dimensional superconducting cavity, recent work on transmon qubits has shown significantly improved T1 times, as long as 95 μs. These results demonstrate that previous T1 times were not limited by Josephson junction losses. Understanding the fundamental limits on the coherence time in superconducting qubits such as the transmon is an active area of research.|$|E

40|$|A dc SQUID phase qubit {{consists}} of two Josephson junctions in a loop. One junction acts as a qubit with two lowest energy levels forming the | 0 > and | 1 > status. The second junction and the loop inductance act to isolate the qubit junction from noise. In this thesis, I report on {{the improvement of the}} relaxation time and the coherence time in a dc SQUID phase qubit that used an LC filter. I also report the measurement of anomalous switching curves. In order to improve the relaxation and coherence times, I used two isolation networks, an LC isolation network and an inductive isolation network, to decouple the device from the current bias lines. This produced a very large total effective resistance of the input leads that increases the relaxation time of the qubit. In addition, I connected a low-loss SiNx <b>shunting</b> <b>capacitor</b> across the qubit junction to reduce dielectric losses. I measured two dc SQUID phase qubits. Device DS 6 had a 4 (μm) 2 Al/AlOx/Al qubit junction with a critical current of 0. 5 μA and a 1 pF <b>shunting</b> <b>capacitor.</b> It used an LC filter made from a 10 nH inductor and a 145 pF capacitor. The capacitors contained N-H rich SiNx which produced a loss tangent of about 7 × 10 - 4. Device DS 8 had a 2 (μm) 2 Al/AlOx/Al qubit junction with a critical current of 77 nA and an LC filter similar to the first one. The <b>shunting</b> <b>capacitor</b> contained Si-H rich SiNx. Using a pulse readout technique, I measured the characteristics of the qubits, including the transition spectrum, Rabi oscillations, relaxation, Ramsey fringes and state tomography. The best relaxation time T 1 for device DS 6 was 32 ns and 280 ns for device DS 8. The best Rabi decay time T' for DS 6 was 42 ns while for device DS 8 it was 120 ns. From these and other data I obtained estimates for the best coherence time T 2 in device DS 6 of 61 ns and 76 ns in device DS 8. In DS 8, I observed anomalous switching curves; i. e. switching curves which were qualitatively different from conventional switching curves. In the conventional case, the switching curve for the superposition state is the weighted sum of the | 0 > and | 1 > curves, but it was not in device DS 8. Instead, the switching curve shifted along the current axis as the exited state probability increased.

The differences between WACS and local control are illustrated utilizing the IEEE 57 bus system as a test bed.

The most significant results stemming from this will be lower losses on the system and an increased power transfer capability. Thus {{it is important that}} the methods used to protect a <b>shunt</b> <b>capacitor</b> bank will ensure that the bank is available when required. While the more common <b>shunt</b> <b>capacitor</b> problems are related to capacitor unit failures, conditions such as bank over currents, surge voltages and harmonics can cause extended undesired conditions. Today's protection methods are able to remove a <b>shunt</b> <b>capacitor</b> bank from service before extensive damage is done, although the location of the faulty capacitor units will not be known (if this was in fact the reason for the protection tripping the bank). This thesis explores the subject of improving the protection of high-voltage <b>shunt</b> <b>capacitor</b> banks, specifically with respect to the detection of unhealthy fuseless capacitor units. An extensive literature search was carried out on the theory pertaining to the protection of <b>shunt</b> <b>capacitor</b> banks, and a model of a fuse less <b>shunt</b> <b>capacitor</b> bank was built in the laboratory to better understand the failing process of an element within a capacitor unit. The changes in the capacitor unit's current and voltage profiles, as well as those of the remaining healthy capacitor units, were monitored as an element failure was simulated (whereby the element forms a solid weld, or short circuit). Stemming from these experiments, it was found that where a bank consists of strings of units with no interconnection between the units of different strings, an element failure in a capacitor unit would cause a significant decrease in voltage across the affected unit. This voltage change could be used to identify when elements are failing in capacitor units, and the location of the unhealthy unit could also be determined. One potential method would be to have capacitor units with built-in voltage transformers attached across each element section in the unit. As element failures occur either send this information to ground level, where it can be read by a microprocessor relay device, or have a display on the outside of the capacitor unit. In the case of the change in unit current, it was found to be very small and thus had no function for detecting unhealthy capacitor units...|$|R
