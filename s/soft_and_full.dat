5000|$|Apart {{from the}} need to match Helvetica, the letter shapes of Arial are also {{strongly}} influenced by Monotype's own Monotype Grotesque designs, released in or by the 1920s, with additional influence from 'New Grotesque', an abortive redesign from 1956. The designs of the R, G and r also resemble Gill Sans. The changes cause the typeface to nearly match Linotype Helvetica in both proportion and weight (see figure), and perfectly match in width. Monotype executive Allan Haley observed, [...] "Arial was drawn more rounded than Helvetica, the curves <b>softer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fuller</b> <b>and</b> the counters more open.

Her eyes were large, brown, <b>soft,</b> <b>and</b> <b>full</b> of the same tender, pensive kindness as her voice and smile; and perhaps it was this air of patient suffering that above all attracted Bertha, in the soreness of her wounded spirit, just as the affectionateness gained Maria, with the instinct of a child.|$|E

He had a fair face, lined and shadowed and dissipated, with tired blue eyes and a blond mustache that failed to altogether hide a well-shaped mouth. It was the kindest and saddest face Allie had ever seen there. She read its story. In her extremity she had acquired a melancholy wisdom in the judgment of the faces of the men drifting through Durade's hall. What Allie had heard in this Englishman's voice she saw in his features.

6000|$|... "She is very kind," [...] said Lucius. But it {{was evident}} from {{the tone of his}} voice that he would have {{preferred}} that all the Ormes should have remained away. In his mind this time of suffering to his mother and to him was a period of trial and probation,--a period, if not of actual disgrace, yet of disgrace before the world; and he thought that it would have best become his mother to have abstained from all friendship out of her own family, and even from all expressed sympathy, till she had vindicated her own purity and innocence. And as he thought of this he declared to himself that he would have sacrificed everything to her comfort and assistance if she would only have permitted it. He would have loved her, and been tender to her, receiving on his own shoulders all those blows which now fell so hardly upon hers. Every word should have been a word of kindness; every look should have been <b>soft</b> <b>and</b> <b>full</b> of affection. He would have treated her not only with all the love which a son could show to a mother, but with all the respect and sympathy which a gentleman could feel for a lady in distress. But then, in order that such a state of things as this should have existed, it would have been necessary that she should have trusted him. She should have leaned upon him, and,--though he did not exactly say so in talking over the matter with himself, still he thought it,--on him and on him only. But she had declined to lean upon him at all. She had gone away to strangers,--she, who should hardly have spoken to a stranger during these sad months! She would not have his care; and under those circumstances he could only stand aloof, hold up his head, and look sternly. As for her innocence, that was a matter of course. He knew that she was innocent. He wanted no one to tell him that his own mother was not a thief, a forger, a castaway among the world's worst wretches. He thanked no one for such an assurance. Every honest man must sympathise with a woman so injured. It would be a necessity of his manhood and of his honesty! But he would have valued most a sympathy which would have abstained from all expression till after that trial should be over. It should have been for him to act and for him to speak during this terrible period. But his mother who was a free agent had willed it otherwise.|$|E
6000|$|XXXIX. I conclude, then, {{that all}} {{arrangements}} of color, {{for its own}} sake, in graceful forms, are barbarous; and that, to paint a color pattern with the lovely lines of a Greek leaf moulding, is an utterly savage procedure. I cannot find anything in natural color like this: {{it is not in}} the bond. I find it in all natural form--never in natural color. If, then, our architectural color is to be beautiful as its form was, by being imitative, we are limited to these conditions--to simple masses of it, to zones, as in the rainbow and the zebra; cloudings and flamings, as in marble shells and plumage, or spots of various shapes and dimensions. All these conditions are susceptible of various degrees of sharpness and delicacy, and of complication in arrangement. The zone may become a delicate line, and arrange itself in chequers and zig-zags. The flaming may be more or less defined, as on a tulip leaf, and may at last be represented by a triangle of color, and arrange itself in stars or other shapes; the spot may be also graduated into a stain, or defined into a square or circle. The most exquisite harmonies may be composed of these simple elements: some <b>soft</b> <b>and</b> <b>full</b> of flushed and melting spaces of color; others piquant and sparkling, or deep and rich, formed of close groups of the fiery fragments: perfect and lovely proportion may be exhibited in the relation of their quantities, infinite invention in their disposition: but, in all cases, their shape will be effective only as it determines their quantity, and regulates their operation on each other; points or edges of one being introduced between breadths of others, and so on. Triangular and barred forms are therefore convenient, or others the simplest possible; leaving the pleasure of the spectator to be taken in the color, and in that only. Curved outlines, especially if refined, deaden the color, and confuse the mind. Even in figure painting the greatest colorists have either melted their outline away, as often Correggio and Rubens; or purposely made their masses of ungainly shape, as Titian; or placed their brightest hues in costume, where they could get quaint patterns, as Veronese, and especially Angelico, with whom, however, the absolute virtue of color is secondary to grace of line. Hence, he never uses the blended hues of Correggio, like those on the wing of the little Cupid, in the [...] "Venus and Mercury," [...] but always the severest type--the peacock plume. Any of these men would have looked with infinite disgust upon the leafage and scrollwork which form the ground of color in our modern painted windows, and yet all whom I have named were much infected with the love of renaissance designs. We must also allow for the freedom of the painter's subject, and looseness of his associated lines; a pattern being severe in a picture, which is over luxurious upon a building. I believe, therefore, {{that it is impossible to}} be over quaint or angular in architectural coloring; and thus many dispositions which I have had occasion to reprobate in form, are, in color, the best that can be invented. I have always, for instance, spoken with contempt of the Tudor style, for this reason, that, having surrendered all pretence to spaciousness and breadth,--having divided its surfaces by an infinite number of lines, it yet sacrifices the only characters which can make lines beautiful; sacrifices all the variety and grace which long atoned for the caprice of the Flamboyant, and adopts, for its leading feature, an entanglement of cross bars and verticals, showing about as much invention or skill of design as the reticulation of the bricklayer's sieve. Yet this very reticulation would in color be highly beautiful; and all the heraldry, and other features which, in form, are monstrous, may be delightful as themes of color (so long as there are no fluttering or over-twisted lines in them); and this observe, because, when colored, they take the place of a mere pattern, and the resemblance to nature, which could not be found in their sculptured forms, is found in their piquant variegation of other surfaces. There is a beautiful and bright bit of wall painting behind the Duomo of Verona, composed of coats of arms, whose bearings are balls of gold set in bars of green (altered blue?) and white, with cardinal's hats in alternate squares. This is of course, however, fit only for domestic work. The front of the Doge's palace at Venice is the purest and most chaste model that I can name (but one) of the fit application of color to public buildings. The sculpture and mouldings are all white; but the wall surface is chequered with marble blocks of pale rose, the chequers being in no wise harmonized, or fitted to the forms of the windows; but looking as if the surface had been completed first, and the windows cut out of it. In Plate XII. fig. 2 the reader will see two of the patterns used in green and white, on the columns of San Michele of Lucca, every column having a different design. Both are beautiful, but the upper one certainly the best. Yet in sculpture its lines would have been perfectly barbarous, and those even of the lower not enough refined.|$|E

40|$|Very deep {{near-infrared}} observations {{have recently}} uncovered a significant population of red galaxies at redshifts z> 2. These distant red galaxies (DRGs) are efficiently {{selected by the}} criterion J-K> 2. 3. We use Chandra data to examine the X-ray emission from DRGs in the 5 'x 5 ' FIRES MS 1054 - 03 field. Two of 40 DRGs with K 1. 2 x 10 ^ 43 ergs/s. This fraction is smaller than that inferred from optical and near-IR spectroscopy, probably largely due to strong spectroscopic selection biases. By stacking all undetected DRGs we find that their average X-ray flux in the 0. 5 - 8 keV band is ~ 4. 6 x 10 ^- 17 ergs/s/cm^ 2, higher {{by a factor of}} ~ 5 than that of Lyman break galaxies in the Chandra Deep Field North. The detection is only significant in the <b>soft</b> <b>and</b> <b>full</b> energy bands. The mean detection may result from star formation, the presence of low luminosity AGN, or a combination of both. Assuming the detection is due exclusively to star formation, we find an average instantaneous star formation rate of 214 +- 68 (random) +- 73 (systematic) solar masses per year, in excellent agreement with previous results from spectral energy distribution fitting when constant star formation histories are assumed. These results may imply that DRGs contribute significantly to the cosmic star formation rate at z~ 2. 5. However, the mean X-ray flux strictly provides only an upper limit to the star formation rate due to the uncertain contribution of low luminosity, possibly obscured AGNs. Observations at other wavelengths are needed to provide independent estimates of the star formation rate of DRGs...|$|E

A stark sense of {{hesitation}} washes over her, and her voice grows <b>softer</b> <b>and</b> more <b>full</b> of doubt as she finds herself unexpectedly {{falling in love with}} her sworn enemy. Her passion for revenge, to which she was originally so committed, gives way to her new-found love: [...] "Let us get on with it… I tremble! Let us avenge… I sigh! / My rage is extinguished when I approach him / He seems to be made for love." [...] The exaggerated use of rests is exemplified perfectly here, in measures 38-42, amidst her rage and vengefulness. Armide is struck by her contradictory and confusing feelings of love, and the use of ellipses conveys this dramatic hesitation and inner turmoil.|$|R
