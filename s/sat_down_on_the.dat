5|$|In the {{build up}} to the World Cup Charlton gave out first caps to Gary Kelly, Phil Babb and Jason McAteer; he had {{difficulty}} convincing McAteer to join Ireland as he first had to turn down an approach by the FA {{to play for the}} England under-21s. He scheduled difficult matches before the tournament and Ireland picked up positive results by beating both the Netherlands and Germany away from home. Ireland opened the group stage of the tournament by beating Italy 1–0 at the Giants Stadium, Ray Houghton scoring the winning goal on 11 minutes. They then fell to a 2–1 defeat to Mexico at the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium, during which Charlton had a pitch-side argument with an official who was preventing substitute John Aldridge (who went on to score the consolation goal) from taking the pitch minutes after his teammate Tommy Coyne had left the pitch and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench. For his arguing, Charlton was suspended by FIFA for the final group game against Norway, and had to watch from the commentary box as Ireland qualified with a 0–0 draw. They faced the Netherlands in the Round of 16; Dennis Bergkamp put the Dutch ahead on 11 minutes after Marc Overmars took advantage of a mistake by Terry Phelan, and Wim Jonk scored the second and final goal of the game from 30 yards after Packie Bonner fluffed an otherwise routine save. For his achievements Charlton was awarded the Freedom of the City of Dublin in 1994 by Lord Mayor Tomás Mac Giolla, the first Englishman to be given the honour since 1854.|$|E
25|$|Chaisson talked Kỳ's marines into pulling back, and {{relieved}} {{them with a}} company of his marines on the western banks of the bridge. He then asked permission from rebel officer to place his marines {{on the other side}} of the bridge, but was rejected. Chaisson ignored the rebel officer and ordered his men to deploy to the Struggle Movement positions anyway. The Americans simply <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road among the rebels without using any force. Walt then arrived and he and Chaisson walked across the bridge. They never reached the other side, as a rebel warrant officer ordered them to halt, threatening to explode the bridge. In the meantime, the rebels fired machine guns low at the Americans, briefly forcing them to duck.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 1980, Vysotsky gave a {{performance}} at a suburban Moscow concert hall. One {{of the stage}} managers recalls that he looked visibly unhealthy ("gray-faced", as she puts it) and complained of not feeling too good, while another says she was surprised by his request for champagne {{before the start of}} the show, as he had always been known for completely abstaining from drink before his concerts. On 16 July Vysotsky gave his last public concert in Kaliningrad. On 18 July, Vysotsky played Hamlet for the last time at the Taganka Theatre. From around 21 July, several of his close friends were on a round-the-clock watch at his apartment, carefully monitoring his alcohol intake and hoping against all odds that his drug dependency would soon be overcome and they would then be able to bring him back from the brink. The effects of drug withdrawal were clearly getting the better of him, as he got increasingly restless, moaned and screamed in pain, and at times fell into memory lapses, failing to recognize at first some of his visitors, including his son Arkadiy. At one point, Vysostsky's personal physician A. Fedotov (the same doctor who had brought him back from clinical death a year earlier in Uzbekistan) attempted to sedate him, inadvertently causing an asphyxiation from which he was barely saved. On 24 July, Vysotsky told his mother that he thought he was going to die that day, and then made similar remarks to a few of the friends present at the apartment, who begged him to stop such talk and keep his spirits up. But soon thereafter, Oksana Afanasyeva saw him clench his chest several times, which led her to suspect that he was genuinely suffering from a cardiovascular condition. She informed Fedotov of this, but was told not to worry, as he was going to monitor Vysotsky's condition all night. In the evening, after drinking relatively small amounts of alcohol, the moaning and groaning Vysotsky was sedated by Fedotov, who then <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> couch next to him but fell asleep. Fedotov awoke in the early hours of 25 July to an unusual silence, and found Vysotsky dead in his bed with his eyes wide open, apparently of a myocardial infarction, as he later certified. This was contradicted by Fedotov's colleagues, Sklifosovsky Emergency Medical Institute physicians L. Sul'povar and S. Scherbakov (who had demanded the actor's instant hospitalization on 23 July, but were, allegedly, defied by Fedotov), who insisted that Fedotov's incompetent sedation combined with alcohol was what killed Vysotsky. An autopsy was prevented by Vysotsky's parents (who were eager to have their son's drug addiction remain secret), so the true cause of death remains unknown.|$|E

500|$|On June 1, 1995, Abu-Jamal's {{death warrant}} {{was signed by}} Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge. Its {{execution}} was suspended while Abu-Jamal pursued state post-conviction review. At the post-conviction review hearings, new witnesses were called. William [...] "Dales" [...] Singletary testified that he saw the shooting and that the gunman was the passenger in Cook's car. Singletary's account contained discrepancies which rendered it [...] "not credible" [...] {{in the opinion of}} the court. William Harmon, a convicted fraudster, testified that Faulkner's murderer fled in a car that pulled up to the crime scene, and could not have been Abu-Jamal. Robert Harkins testified that he had witnessed a man stand over Faulkner as the latter lay wounded on the ground, who shot him point-blank in the face and then [...] "walked and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> curb".|$|E
500|$|During the Confessions Tour in 2006, Madonna <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of}} the stage and {{performed}} an acoustic, stripped-down version of the song. She was joined by Yitzhak Sinwani of the London Kabbalah Centre, who had also been present earlier in the show {{for the performance of}} the song [...] "Isaac". Writing for Pitchfork Media, Stephen Deusner complimented Madonna's singing, saying that [...] " [...] she's got a deeper, heartier range that works best on ballads like 'Drowned World'". The song was not included on the NBC special, The Confessions Tour: Live from London, which aired on November 22, 2006, but it was present on the full-length DVD release. The track was performed on the London stop of the Rebel Heart Tour, on December 2, 2015, at The O2 Arena, in memory of Collins, who had died two years ago. The following year, it was included on the setlist of her [...] show in Melbourne, Australia. The show started with Madonna appearing onstage, in a clown's costume consisting of a billowing dress, pink and yellow stalkings, riding a tricycle and circled round it.|$|E

500|$|On January 28, 1970, a {{third and}} final Band of Gypsys {{appearance}} took place; they performed during a music festival at Madison Square Garden benefiting the anti-Vietnam War Moratorium Committee titled the [...] "Winter Festival for Peace". American blues guitarist Johnny Winter was backstage before the concert; he recalled: [...] " [...] came in with his head down, {{sat on the couch}} alone, and put his head in his hands... He didn't move until {{it was time for the}} show." [...] Minutes after taking the stage he snapped a vulgar response at a woman who had shouted a request for [...] "Foxy Lady". He then began playing [...] "Earth Blues" [...] before telling the audience: [...] "That's what happens when earth fucks with space". Moments later, he briefly <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drum riser before leaving the stage. Both Miles and Redding later stated that Jeffery had given Hendrix LSD before the performance. Miles believed that Jeffery gave Hendrix the drugs in an effort to sabotage the current band and bring about the return of the original Experience lineup. Jeffery fired Miles after the show and Cox quit, ending the Band of Gypsys.|$|E
500|$|The United Auto Workers (UAW) {{was founded}} in Detroit on August 26, 1935. The labor union {{struggled}} to gain members until the Flint Sit-Down Strike in 1937. The strike started on December 30, 1936, when workers at the Fisher Body Plant No.1 stopped loading tool dies on the night shift, locking themselves into the plant. The dies were destined for shipment to plants where union activity was much weaker than the UAW-organized plants in Flint. [...] On January 3, 1937, workers at the plant <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> job; Fisher Plant No.2 later joined in the sit-down strike. The heat was shut off at the plants, and on January 11, food deliveries were stopped, sparking a riot. Governor Frank Murphy mobilized 4,000National Guard troops to keep peace at the plants. A second riot occurred at Chevrolet Plant No.4 on February 1. The National Guard troops surrounded the 12striking plants in Flint, but the governor never ordered them into action. President Franklin D. Roosevelt encouraged the two parties to sit down once more, and an agreement was signed, recognizing the UAW in the 17 striking plants across the country.|$|E
500|$|Travelers on the Suspension Bridge {{witnessed}} several death-defying stunts performed {{across the}} Niagara Gorge. [...] On June 30, 1859, they saw Charles Blondin's feat {{of becoming the}} first man to cross the chasm on a tightrope. [...] In mid-crossing Blondin <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rope and lowered a line to retrieve a drink from the deck of the Maid of the Mist below. [...] In his later tightrope acts at the same spot, the acrobat would perform a different stunt on each occasion. [...] One time he cooked and ate an omelette in mid-crossing; another time he carried his manager Harry Colcord on his back. [...] While giving Colcord a piggyback ride, Blondin stopped five times on the tightrope to rest and recover his strength; each time Colcord gingerly got off Blondin's back and stood on the tightrope, climbing back on after the acrobat had enough rest. [...] Blondin's success inspired other acrobats, such as William Leonard Hunt ("The Great Farini"), Samuel Dixon, Clifford Calverly, and Signorina Maria Spelterini, to emulate and try to surpass his acts at the same spot. [...] The Signorina, the only woman to walk across the Niagara on a tightrope, once crossed while blindfolded and another time with her hands and legs in manacles.|$|E

2500|$|The second show I {{ever saw}} of the Descendents {{was at the}} Dancing Waters in San Pedro. They broke into the set and he was playing guitar so hard and so angry that his pants fell down.

I can {{remember}} standing in line at a Misfits show {{and all of a}} sudden he just <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and started holding his head like his ears were ringing or something, and said something to the effect of [...] "What am I doing here?

2500|$|On June 4, 2011, Wallenda {{completed}} a [...] high-wire crossing {{between the two}} towers of the ten-story Condado Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The [...] performance was a recreation of the act that had killed Karl Wallenda in 1978. For the performance, Wallenda's mother, Delilah (Karl's granddaughter), joined him. The mother and son team started {{at opposite ends of}} the wire. [...] When Delilah reached the middle of the wire, roughly the spot Karl had fallen, she <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wire and Nik stepped over her before the two continued to opposite ends of the wire. At one point during the performance, Nik knelt down on the wire and blew a kiss in honor of his great-grandfather's memory.|$|E
2500|$|David Bowie, {{a fan of}} the band, then {{offered them}} a song he had just written. As Hunter {{recalled}} in a 2004 DVD interview, [...] "He offered us [...] "Suffragette City", which I didn't think was good enough. And then he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, Regent Street it was, in a publisher's office, and plays 'All The Young Dudes' on an acoustic guitar." [...] It reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart, and revived the band, who were appreciative of Bowie's rescue. Guitarist Ralphs relates that Bowie taught Mott studio tricks, but one of the best-known sounds during the period was a 'hand-clap-in-the-toilet' routine that relied more on Hunter's vision than it did on Bowie's clearly more experienced studio abilities. Bowie guitarist Mick Ronson also significantly contributed to Mott's sound, a fact noticed by Hunter, who would later collaborate with Ronson a great deal.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difficulty}} {{of this argument}} for some compatibilists {{lies in the fact}} that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if she had so desired. But it follows from the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of [...] "incredible abilities", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its [...] "decider". David Lewis suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if different circumstances had actually obtained in the past.|$|E
2500|$|On October 15, 2008, Wallenda {{performed}} on a live broadcast of Today. The {{plan was to}} walk and then bicycle off {{the roof of the}} Prudential Center in Downtown Newark, New Jersey, across a suspended high-wire 13 and 1/2 stories (135feet) above the ground. Starting at 8:30am, he first walked across the [...] cable with a [...] balancing pole. Halfway through, he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wire and called the Today show hosts. [...] "Where are you?" [...] he asked, joking that he was expecting to carry one of the show's hosts across the wire on his shoulder. Sitting down on the wire is easy, he said, it is getting back up that is tricky. A few steps before completing the walk, Wallenda stopped and waved to the crowd. When he resumed, he wobbled and had to bend his knees to regain balance. [...] "I actually slipped," [...] he said later. [...] "I lost focus there for a moment" [...] because of some unexpected tape on the wire. He completed the walk in about five minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Manchester City {{hold the}} second highest {{attendance}} record in English football (84,569), recently beaten by Tottenham Hotspur F.C on 14 September 2016 as Spurs are temporarily playing UEFA Champions League [...] "home" [...] games at Wembley stadium. However Manchester City F.C still hold {{the record for the}} highest attended all English football match, 84,569 fans packed Maine Road for a sixth round FA Cup tie against Stoke City in 1934 (City {{went on to win the}} FA Cup that season). The ground was packed two and a half hours before kick-off, as supporters <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> touchline only yards from goalkeeper Frank Swift and the magnitude of the crowd caused a crush barrier to collapse causing a few injuries. Since then, the club has moved to the Eastlands (also known as the Etihad Stadium) near to where the club was formed in 1880. It has gradually gained a reputation as a modern atmospheric stadium despite fans initial reservations about moving from the famous Maine Road which although atmospheric was considered to be in a dilapidated state.|$|E

2500|$|P. G.

2500|$|Bodenheimer (1979, pp 299–300) {{believes}} that the narrator {{is interested in the}} psychology of her characters: their inner selves, how their contentious interactions with others subconsciously reveal their beliefs and how the changes they experience reflect their negotiation of the outside world. Matus (2007, pp.35–43) also focuses on Gaskell's depiction of [...] "interiority" [...] (the psychic process), expressed in dreams and trances such as Thornton's dream of Margaret as a temptress or the rioters' [...] "trance of passion". The phrase [...] "as if" [...] appears over 200 times, suggesting Gaskell's reluctance to appear too definitive in her narration (O'Farrell, 1997, p 16): [...] "Bessy, who had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first chair, as if completely tired out with her walk" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 11) and [...] " [...] spoke as if this consequence were so entirely logical" [...] (chapter 19). The phrase is primarily used when exploring the characters' sensations and feelings: [...] "As if she felt his look, she turned to him" [...] (chapter 22); [...] "He had shaken off his emotion as if he was ashamed of ever giving way to it" [...] (chapter 28), and [...] "She lifted up her head, as if she took pride in any delicacy of feeling which Mr. Thornton had shown" [...] (chapter 39). Gaskell uses it when exploring the unconscious process that allows Thornton, whose suffering in love disturbs his composure and control of his feelings, to communicate with Higgins (Matus, 2007, p 40): [...] " ... and then the conviction went in, as if by some spell, and touched the latent tenderness of his heart" [...] (chapter 39).|$|E
