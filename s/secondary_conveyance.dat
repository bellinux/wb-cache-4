40|$|The present {{project of}} Alqueva in Alentejo region forsees an {{increase}} in water availability and irrigation surface of 110 thousand ha. In this article the socio-economic impact of irrigation in Alentejo farms is assessed, considering the case of Odivelas irrigation scheme. The methodological focuses on the combination of an agronomic plant growth model with a mathematical model of aggregated stochastic linear programming. The model {{was applied to the}} representative farms of Odivelas irrigation scheme considering different scenarios of of allocation of pumping costs of water and of the amortization of a <b>secondary</b> <b>conveyance</b> water network. It was concluded that irrigation development produces positive socio-economic impacts on farms of Alentejo. More regular water availability makes irrigated surface and income during the water scarcity years more stable, almost the same as water rich years. These effects, on average, lead on {{an increase in}} irrigated surface, farmersâ€™ income, investments and farm labour...|$|E
