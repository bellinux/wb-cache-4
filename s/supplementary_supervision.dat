40|$|Abstract. Th e {{focus of}} this article is to analyse the {{development}} of large fi nancial groups in the fi nancial market called fi nancial conglomerates, and to analyse the adequacy of their supervision, weather procedures and instruments of prudential supervision enable supervisory authorities to get the required information and to take eff ective decisions. In this article, the re-view of scientifi c literature allowed to distinguish three main typologies of fi nancial conglomer-ate structures. Analysis shows that a large variety of fi nancial conglomerate structures causes the risks of contagion, risk of concentration, management complexity and confl icts of interests and requires more intense and a diff erent kind of their prudential supervision. Th e current European Union legislation provides for a comprehensive set of rules on prudential supervision, but the latest fi ndings have indicated that group risks arise across the whole fi nancial sector, underscor-ing the importance of the <b>supplementary</b> <b>supervision</b> of the links within fi nancial groups and between fi nancial institutions. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>supervision</b> on group risks will enhance fi nancial stability and better protection of depositors, insurance policy holders and investors.

Focusing on Cambodia, which achieved almost complete dollarization during 1991 - 95, the authors review recent developments {{in the literature on}} dollarization and examine {{the costs and benefits of}} dollarization in Cambodia, including the ensuing macroeconomic policy implications. They carry out an econometric estimation of cash foreign currency circulation in Cambodia in order to gauge the degree of dollarization. In addition to this analysis, the authors present a short description of Cambodia’s economic, financial, and structural background.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} bank behavior {{that focuses on the}} interaction between the incentives created by fixed rate deposit insurance and a bank's choice of its loan portfolio and its portfolio of market-traded financial assets. The model is used to analyze the consequences of adopting the Federal Reserve Board's proposed PreCommitment Approach (PCA) for setting capital requirements for the market risks of a bank's trading portfolio. Under the PCA, a bank sets its own market risk capital requirement with the knowledge that it will face regulatory penalties should its trading activities generate subsequent losses that exceed its market risk capital pre-commitment. The Pre-Commitment Approach: Using Incentives to Set Market Risk Capital Requirements 1. Introduction It is well-known that the provision of fixed-rate deposit insurance creates problems of moral hazard and adverse selection that must be attenuated through <b>supplementary</b> <b>supervision</b> and regulation.

40|$|Over time, the banking, {{insurance}} and securities sectors {{have become increasingly}} interlinked and one way through which this occurs is via financial conglomerates. Such groups, in particular those that combine banking and insurance, have over time become more important in Europe. They require an appropriate regulatory and supervisory set-up {{to deal with the}} specific risks they raise. In the EU, this regulatory set-up was introduced with the Financial Conglomerates Directive (2002) and which Member States are now implementing into national law. The Directive introduces a regime of <b>supplementary</b> <b>supervision,</b> in addition to the one that already exists for the regulated entities of the conglomerate. The Directive covers areas such a capital requirements, intra-group transactions, large exposures, organisational requirements and information exchange between authorities. The paper further compares the regime in the US and the EU. It concludes with issues that might require attention from authorities in the future. cross-sector risk, European Union, financial conglomerate, financial regulation, financial supervision. ...|$|E
40|$|This Article builds upon prior {{empirical}} {{findings on}} the prevalence of pyramids and focuses on the financing subsidies derived through the internal capital markets of pyramids [...] particularly through affiliations with financial institutions. Part I of this Article provides {{a brief overview of}} the relevant literature and the role that pyramids can play in separating ownership and voting rights. Part II describes the phenomenon by which the financing advantages derived by firms with financial affiliates, often non-bank financial institutions (“NBFIs”), results in a distortion of the market that contributes to pyramid expansion, thereby exacerbating the risk of minority shareholder expropriation. Part III then proposes a regulatory structure that could help reduce this distortion, drawing upon a recent EU Directive on <b>supplementary</b> <b>supervision</b> of financial conglomerates. Part IV uses the example of Korea to specifically describe how the subsidization provided by NBFIs within business groups can distort the market and lead to expropriation. Finally, Part V explains how the proposed regulatory structure could be concretely applied in Korea to address this distortion...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of a relationship between macroprudential and microprudential policy on a general level and on an example of regulatorily required structure and volume of bank capital. Regulatory requirements and supervisory methods are described {{in connection with the}} institutional structure of regulation and supervision within the European economic area. An attention is paid to the development of supervision on an individual basis through consolidated supervision to <b>supplementary</b> <b>supervision</b> of financial conglomerates, which corresponds with the activity and structure of the financial sector, high rate of integration and transboundary action of financial groups headed by a bank. The European System of Financial Supervision and Single Supervisory Mechanism are presented. Development of the regulation of bank capital is analysed. The original microprudential approach is mentioned that involved macroeconomic impacts from its introduction. Based on the analysis of capital structure as conceived from Basel I to Basel III approaches of regulation to this important indicator are discussed. Instability sources and indicative instruments of macroprudential policy are analysed on an example of the excessive growth of credits and leverage as an instability source and countercyclical capital buffer, sectoral capital requirements and leverage ratio in the role of indicative instruments.

40|$|A {{traditional}} {{subject matter}} falling under the general heading of our Article {{is related to}} the Greek and European legislators 2 ̆ 7 reaction towards the negative consequences and unfair practices in which intragroup transactions may result. Such transactions may result in detriment to shareholders, employees, and creditors, {{as well as of the}} state 2 ̆ 7 s interests regarding taxation policies. Currently, these considerations are not fully addressed by the traditional legal regime in Greece; as a result, discussion is still in progress. At an EU level, the recent legislative initiatives-in particular Directive 2002 / 87 /EC on the <b>supplementary</b> <b>supervision</b> of credit institutions, insurance undertakings, and investment firms in a financial conglomerate-seek to introduce specific prudential legislation for financial conglomerates. These directives also take the first steps to align the legislation on the European level with national laws concerning financial groups and financial conglomerates in the same sector, thus ensuring a minimum level of equal treatment of these groups throughout the European Union. The main objective, however, of the new EU regime is to ensure that separate state regulators-who typically focus on one sector in order to ensure capital adequacy of the entities under their supervision-are not hindered because of the existence of cross-sector financial conglomerates. This requires specific measures which will prevent situations, for example, where capital is used at the same time as a buffer against risk in two or more entities belonging in the same financial conglomerate (2 ̆ 2 multiple gearing 2 ̆ 2) and situations where a parent company issues debt and directs the proceeds as equity to its regulated subsidiaries (2 ̆ 2 excessive leverage 2 ̆ 2).

40|$|On connaît depuis {{longtemps}} la formule « A travail égal, salaire égal ». Quelle en est la véritable signification ? Quelles objections lui apporte-t-on ? Quels arguments militent en sa faveur ? L'auteur qui a déjà publié une remarquable étude intitulée « Problèmes du Travail féminin » expose ici son point de vue sur ces questions qui intéressent non seulement le quart de la main-d'oeuvre non agricole du Canada, mais encore toute notre société. For decades, "Equal pay {{for equal}} work" {{has been a}} widely used formula. What is its true significance? What are the objections against it and the arguments in its favour? The author, who has already published a remarkable study entitled "Problems of Women Workers" gives {{his point of view}} on these questions which are of interest, not only to one-quarter of the non-agricultural Labour force in Canada, but to all our society as well. In Canada alone, more than a million women are now working outside their homes. This situation creates an ever-increasing number of problems, both important and complex. First of all, the question of wages for female labour is closely related to the general wage structure and theory. It consists in practice of an attempt to balance production and consumption by increasing the standard of living in proportion to the productive capacity of the workers of both sexes. As long as this balance is not reached, neither society by its labour legislation or social security system, nor the labour movement, by its pressure and activities, will succeed in placing women on an equal basis with men on the labour market and thus eliminate the discrimination against women. "Equal pay for equal work" might be stated also as "Equal remuneration between male and female labour for work of equal value". It is understood that women's work is paid less than men's. In fact, there seems to exist two labour markets, one for men and another one for women. On one hand, men consider quite often women's salary as a kind of "extra" to help the head of the family; on the other hand, the women, in a majority, have a tendency to accept a lower wage and, as a whole, have a weaker bargaining position than men. In spite of this, the author tries to find a fair basis of remuneration which may be applied equally to men and women. He looks at three possible methods of determining the equality or inequality of wages between them. First, the comparative output of men and women may apply where both are employed at identical work, the value of which is determined by an estimate of the feminine output compared with the masculine output. Definite cases are shown to better illustrate this. The formula is an emergency one; {{it is by no means}} adequate. The second method: the relative value of female labour as related to production costs. This standard applies where women replace men or carry out the same tasks. The current arguments to support this method are quoted and criticized: women require <b>supplementary</b> <b>supervision,</b> additional help; it would be necessary to establish different standards, lower production schedules: women, being weaker physically, are subject to more frequent absenteeism; their professional life is shorter; for the welfare of female workers, legislation imposes and might further impose new standards; the employer may have to adopt special measures and particular installations, medical and sanitary services, cloak-rooms, cafeterias, etc. No such arguments should be used, the relevance of which cannot be mathematically determined. Employers are urged to be very careful about using them arbitrarily. The third method is that of the objective and scientific rating of jobs. Actually, this formula means: time and motion study and job evaluation. The time and motion study tries to find the best method of doing a specified task and attempts to get the workers to be able and willing to give their maximum output. Job evaluation establishes the relationship required and accordingly brings about differences in wages. It includes an analysis, a description and a relative evaluation of the task itself: the technique is in its infancy, has many limitations which have first to be acknowledged and corrected; but there seems to be no alternative to it. The author concludes that the application of the principle "Equal pay for equal work", in the case of female labour, seems to be a highly desirable objective, on moral and economic grounds both for women, for men and society as a whole. In spite of equal pay for equal work, women must remain feminine, even at -work; their value is a specific one; their dignity requires an appropriate remuneration...|$|E
