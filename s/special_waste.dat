Paul Rowen MP, the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Rochdale, raised the issue and the results in a House of Commons debate on 28 June 2005. He said: [...] "At the request of residents, the Health and Safety Commission recently tested rubble from parts of the factory buildings on the site. Of the eight samples tested, three confirmed the existence of asbestos of up to 1%, which is 10 {{times higher than the}} proportion ensuring that waste is classed as <b>special</b> <b>waste.</b> Yet in his planning submission, the developer stated: [...] "Of particular note is the absence of any asbestos contamination"; and in a meeting with local councillors earlier this year, he and his expert witness said that the tests on the rubble had all been negative. For the past 10 months, open wagons have been transporting that rubble around the borough to unknown places, and subject to no control... This case involves a development costing up to £100 million for which the developer has so far paid Rochdale Council a £5,500 planning application fee. For that, the council is expected to carry out all the checks and controls to ensure that the developer is acting honourably." ...|$|E

The growing popularity of paddling, hiking, and climbing has created <b>special</b> <b>waste</b> disposal issues throughout the world. It is a dominant topic for outdoor organizations and their members. For example, in some places the sewage is collected in drums which need to be helicoptered in and out at considerable expense. Alternatively, some parks mandate a [...] "pack it in, pack it out" [...] rule. Many reports document the use of containers for the removal of excrement, which must be packed in and packed out on Mount Everest. Also known as [...] "expedition barrels" [...] or [...] "bog barrels", the cans are weighed to make sure that groups do not dump them along the way. [...] "Toilet tents" [...] are erected. This would seem to be an improvement over the prior practices, including the so-called [...] "McKinley system"; there has been an increasing awareness that the mountain needs to be kept clean, for the health of the climbers at least.

The EPA’s decision was based on its determinations that oil, gas, and geothermal production was already regulated by the states, that Subtitle C did not have the regulatory flexibility to deal effectively with the wastes, and that the permitting requirements of Subtitle C would impose unreasonable delays on oil, gas, and geothermal extraction. However, the EPA report identified regulatory gaps for oil and gas wastes, for which it recommended additional rules under existing EPA regulatory authority, under RCRA Subtitle D, the Clean Water Act, and the Safe Water Drinking Act.|$|E

The general cost structure of the hydrologic information gathering process is represented in information cost curves which are combined with production cost or opportunity loss curves to give total cost curves.
