5|$|Although it {{was planned}} that <b>some</b> <b>key</b> {{scenes of the}} episode would be filmed without an {{audience}} {{in order to avoid}} leaks of plot spoilers, the producers decided not to worry about the issue and filmed it all in front of the live studio audience. The producers also instigated the rumor that multiple endings would be filmed; in fact, only one was planned and shot.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the filmmakers}} put {{considerable}} effort into historical accuracy, particularly in details, {{the film is}} known for <b>some</b> <b>key</b> distortions of history. An entirely fictional sequence was added in which Truman agonizes over whether to authorize the attack; anti-aircraft shells are shown bursting around the Enola Gay on its bombing run over Hiroshima; and {{it is said that}} leaflets were dropped on Hiroshima for ten days in advance of the mission warning the citizens of the forthcoming raid. The film received generally mixed reviews, and was a box office disappointment.|$|E

5|$|Another one-party cabinet was {{announced}} in January 1992, which prompted large scale protests in Kigali, and finally forced Habyarimana to make real concessions. He promised {{for the first time}} to negotiate with the RPF; a multiparty cabinet formed in April, still dominated by the MRND, but with opposition figures in <b>some</b> <b>key</b> positions. The opposition members of this cabinet met with the RPF, and were successful in negotiating a ceasefire. In July 1992 the rebels agreed to stop fighting, and the parties began a peace negotiation process headquartered in the Tanzanian city of Arusha.|$|E
5|$|As a {{technology}} showcase, Valve considered Lost Coast {{to have very}} demanding system requirements. The game runs on computers with specifications lower than what is recommended, albeit without <b>some</b> <b>key</b> features such as high dynamic range. If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, the developer commentary is changed slightly to reflect this. For example, Valve president Gabe Newell would describe the effects that are seen in a different manner.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo has {{released}} few technical details regarding the Wii system, but <b>some</b> <b>key</b> facts have leaked through the press. Although {{none of these}} reports has been officially confirmed, they generally indicate that the console is an extension (or advancement) of the Nintendo GameCube architecture. Specifically, the analyses report that the Wii is roughly 1.5 to 2times as powerful as its predecessor. Based on specifications, the Wii {{has been called the}} least powerful of the major home consoles of its generation.|$|E

5|$|The fifth month into D.C. United's {{regular season}} {{campaign}} marked {{the return of}} several players whom were previously injured throughout the season. <b>Some</b> <b>key</b> players included Dejan Jakovic, Kurt Morsink and Santino Quaranta. On the field, D.C. United was scheduled to host Canada's two MLS franchises, Toronto FC and Vancouver Whitecaps FC, respectively. While recent United acquisition, and former Toronto captain, Dwayne De Rosario scored a hat trick against his former club, a shorthanded United ended up drawing 3–3 against Toronto. The following weekend, United posted a 4–0 thrashing of last-place Vancouver, earning their largest home victory since 2008.|$|E
5|$|The work is unfinished; {{a number}} of details, most noticeably the pope's right hand, are missing. Other {{passages}} are bland and uniform, with <b>some</b> <b>key</b> areas still blocked by the underdrawing. Many of Titian's characteristic finishing touches are missing; Paul's fur-lined sleeves do not contain the polishing white strokes of the 1543 portrait, or his usual final overglaze or glossing.|$|E
5|$|Today, some {{prerogative}} {{powers are}} directly exercised by ministers without {{the approval of}} Parliament, including the powers of declaring war and of making peace, the issue of passports, and the granting of honours. Prerogative powers are exercised nominally by the monarch, but {{on the advice of}} the prime minister (whom the monarch meets weekly) and of the cabinet. <b>Some</b> <b>key</b> functions of the British government are still executed by virtue of the royal prerogative, but generally the usage of the prerogative has been diminishing as functions are progressively put on a statutory basis.|$|E

5|$|Underwater {{noise from}} shipping, drilling, {{and other human}} {{activities}} is a significant concern in <b>some</b> <b>key</b> killer whale habitats, including Johnstone Strait and Haro Strait. In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from salmon farms were used to deter seals. Killer whales also avoided the surrounding waters. High-intensity sonar used by the Navy disturbs killer whales along with other marine mammals. Killer whales are popular with whale watchers, which may stress the whales and alter their behavior, particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel.|$|E
5|$|While castles {{were used}} to hold a site and control {{movement}} of armies, in the Holy Land <b>some</b> <b>key</b> strategic positions were left unfortified. Castle architecture in the East became more complex around the late 12th and early 13thcenturies after the stalemate of the Third Crusade (1189–1192). Both Christians and Muslims created fortifications, and the character of each was different. Saphadin, the 13th-century ruler of the Saracens, created structures with large rectangular towers that influenced Muslim architecture and were copied again and again, however they had little influence on Crusader castles.|$|E
5|$|During {{the start}} of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935, President Manuel Quezon hired Paris-trained Filipino {{architect}} Andrés Luna de San Pedro, son of painter Juan Luna, to take charge of the renovations of the Manila Hotel. It was done {{under the supervision of the}} renowned engineering firm Pedro Siochi and Company. The hotel was the residence of General Douglas MacArthur when he became the Military Advisor of the Commonwealth. Luna converted the hotel's top floor into an elegant penthouse and expanded the west wing northward – creating the air-conditioned annex - and designed <b>some</b> <b>key</b> public rooms like the Fiesta Pavilion, then the biggest function room of the hotel. The hotel was the site of festivities during the inauguration of the Philippine Commonwealth government in November, 1935.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the Colts' defense improved, {{making the}} team the clear {{favorites}} in the NFL. They {{won the first}} 13 {{games of the season}} and finished with a 14–2 record, while ranking second in the NFL in both points scored and fewest points allowed. But once again they lost in the divisional round of the playoffs, this time to the #6 seeded Pittsburgh Steelers, 21–18. After another disappointing loss, Manning had developed a reputation of being unable to make it to a championship, a reputation that followed him from college after he was unable to win an NCAA title with the Tennessee Volunteers (who won a title the year after he graduated). The Colts lost <b>some</b> <b>key</b> players after the 2005 season, including James, who departed the Colts for the Arizona Cardinals, and kicker Mike Vanderjagt, the NFL's all-time leader in field goal percentage, who left for the Dallas Cowboys.|$|E
5|$|In a Chess Notes feature article, Edward Winter {{showed that}} the origins of this opening are not yet entirely elucidated. The first known game with the Budapest Gambit is Adler–Maróczy (played in Budapest in 1896). This game already {{featured}} <b>some</b> <b>key</b> aspects of the gambit, such as active play for the black pieces, and White making the typical mistake of moving the queen too early. As the player of the white pieces was not a strong player, the new opening went unnoticed apart from the local experts who had witnessed the game. The Hungarians István Abonyi, Zsigmond Barász and Gyula Breyer further developed the opening. Abonyi played it in 1916 against the Dutch surgeon Johannes Esser in a small tournament in Budapest. The Austrian player Josef Emil Krejcik played it against Helmer in Vienna in 1917. Carl Schlechter published an optimistic analysis of the gambit in the Deutsche Schachzeitung.|$|E

The climax sequences were shot in August 2014 on Mahesh and other supporting cast at Rachakonda near Ramoji Film City. The remaining part of the climax sequences, including an action sequence on Mahesh and Sood, was filmed at the hilly areas in Ramoji Film City. After completing the schedule at Europe on 25 August 2014, the unit returned to Hyderabad three days later. Principal photography ended on 5 September 2014 at Ooty.|$|E

5|$|Some of Garrison's staff {{begin to}} doubt his motives and {{disagree}} with his methods, {{and leave the}} investigation. Garrison's marriage is strained when his wife Liz (Sissy Spacek) complains that he is spending {{more time on the}} case than with his own family. After a sinister phone call is made to their daughter, Liz accuses Garrison of being selfish and attacking Shaw only because of his homosexuality. In addition, the media launches attacks on television and in newspapers attacking Garrison's character and criticizing the way his office is spending taxpayers' money. <b>Some</b> <b>key</b> witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others, such as Ferrie, are killed in suspicious circumstances. Before his death, Ferrie tells Garrison that he believes people are after him, and reveals there was a conspiracy around Kennedy's death.|$|E
5|$|The peak {{years of}} {{psychedelic}} rock were between 1966 and 1969, with milestone events including the 1967 Summer of Love and the 1969 Woodstock Rock Festival, becoming an international musical movement {{associated with a}} widespread counterculture before beginning a decline as changing attitudes, the loss of <b>some</b> <b>key</b> individuals and a back-to-basics movement, led surviving performers to move into new musical areas. The genre bridged the transition from early blues and folk-based rock to progressive rock and hard rock, {{and as a result}} contributed to the development of sub-genres such as heavy metal. Since the late 1970s it has been revived in various forms of neo-psychedelia.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} moving oil {{off of a}} tanker is similar to loading, but has <b>some</b> <b>key</b> differences. The {{first step in the}} {{operation}} is following the same pretransfer procedures as used in loading. When the transfer begins, it is the ship's cargo pumps that are used to move the product ashore. As in loading, the transfer starts at low pressure to ensure that equipment is working correctly and that connections are secure. Then a steady pressure is achieved and held during the operation. While pumping, tank levels are carefully watched and key locations, such as the connection at the cargo manifold and the ship's pumproom are constantly monitored. Under the direction of the person in charge, crew members open and close valves to direct the flow of product and maintain close communication with the receiving facility to decrease and finally stop the flow of liquid.|$|E
