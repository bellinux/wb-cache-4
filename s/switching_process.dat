50|$|Next to the {{dimorphism}} and {{the first}} described high frequency switching system C. albicans undergoes another high frequency <b>switching</b> <b>process</b> called white to opaque switching, which is another phenotypic <b>switching</b> <b>process</b> in C. albicans. It was the second high-frequency switching system discovered in C. albicans. The white to opaque switching is an epigenetic switching system. Phenotypic switching {{is often used to}} refer to white-opaque switching, which consists of two phases: one that grows as round cells in smooth, white colonies (referred to as white form) and one that is rod-like and grows as flat, gray colonies (called opaque form). This switch from white cells to opaque cells is important for the virulence and the mating process of C. albicans as the opaque form is the mating competent form, being a million times more efficient in mating compared to the white type. This switching between white and opaque form is regulated by the WOR1 regulator (White to Opaque Regulator 1) which is controlled by the mating type locus (MTL) repressor (a1-α2) that inhibits the expression of WOR1. Besides the white and opaque phase there is also a third one: the gray phenotype. This phenotype shows the highest ability to cause cutaneous infections. The white, opaque and gray phenotypes form a tristable phenotypic switching system.

50|$|The two {{transformers}} were - unusual at the SBB - air ventilated. The {{design was}} the same as the Be 5/7 of the BLS. The switches were fixed to the transformers. The connection to the respective voltage steps was executed with contact camshafts. The <b>switching</b> <b>process</b> was started with special sparkle extinguishing camshafts. The step switch used compressed air and had 12 steps. Since the two switches were operated alternatively, this meant that 23 steps were required which meant that the switching time was very slow. To operate the step switches, the locomotive driver had to turn a vertical crank handle once for each step. It was possible to shut off power by running down both step switches with a special handle.|$|E

50|$|In semiconductors, {{adding a}} small amount of energy pushes more {{electrons}} into the conduction band, making them more conductive and allowing current to flow like a conductor. Reversing the polarity of this applied energy pushes the electrons into the more widely separated bands, making them insulators and stopping the flow. Since the amount of energy needed to push the electrons between these two levels is very small, semiconductors allow switching with very little energy input. However, this <b>switching</b> <b>process</b> depends on the electrons being naturally distributed between the two states, so small inputs cause the population statistics to change rapidly. As the external temperature changes, due to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution more and more electrons will normally find themselves in one state or the other, causing the switching action to occur on its own, or stop entirely.|$|E

50|$|LCD {{shutters}} {{consist of}} an encapsulated liquid that changes its polarization {{in response to}} an applied electrical field. The response is fairly linear, so even a small amount of leaked power reaching the surrounding shutters causes the image to become blurry. To counteract this effect, and improve switching speed, LCDs use an Active matrix addressing of transparent thin-film transistors to directly switch each shutter. This adds complexity to the LCD screen and makes them more difficult to manufacture. The shutters are not perfect and allow light to leak through, which reduces both relative brightness and color gamut. Additionally, the use of a polarizer, to create the shutter, limits the viewing angles where a visually indistinguishable contrast-ratio experience may be had. Most importantly, the <b>switching</b> <b>process</b> takes some time, on the order of milliseconds, which leads to blurring of fast moving scenes. Massive investment in the LCD manufacturing process has addressed most of these issues, but no single LCD-based solution has proven able to overcome all of the aforementioned issues.|$|E

5000|$|DFT {{accounts}} {{for all three}} effects using the same principles and same parameters across all three findings. According to DFT, the attention switching mechanism is crucial for producing the similarity effect, but the lateral inhibitory connections are critical for explaining the compromise and attraction effects. If the attention <b>switching</b> <b>process</b> is eliminated, then the similarity effect disappears, and if the lateral connections are all set to zero, then the attraction and compromise effects disappear. This property of the theory entails an interesting prediction {{about the effects of}} time pressure on preferences. The contrast effects produced by lateral inhibition require time to build up, which implies that the attraction and compromise effects should become larger under prolonged deliberation (see Roe et al.2001). Alternatively, if context effects are produced by switching from a weighted average rule under binary choice to a quick heuristic strategy for the triadic choice, then these effects should get larger under time pressure. Empirical tests show that prolonging the decision process increases the effects [...] and time pressure decreases the effects.|$|E

From the end of May 1983 the IBA extended TV-am's hours to 9:25 am to allow continuous programming, following which Good Morning Britain was reduced to a two-hour slot from 7 am to 9 am. The 9 am to 9:25 am section was relaunched as a female-orientated lifestyle magazine segment titled After Nine. Although TV-am was a separate broadcaster occupying the ITV network channel during the morning, from the late 1980s the ITV stations extended their hours to 6 am to provide 24-hour television, handing over to TV-am at 6 am, which may have further fuelled the viewer's technically incorrect impression that TV-am was a programming slot within the ITV schedule.|$|E

Thus, working with a theoretical framework based on the existence of an invariant measure for a whole sample is not satisfactory. Empirically alternative strategies have been developed introducing dynamics inside modelling mainly through the parameter with the use of rolling windows.

5000|$|Opaque OXCs (electronic switching) - One can {{implement}} an OXC in {{the electronic}} domain: all the input optical signals are converted into electronic signals after they are demultiplexed by demultiplexers.

5000|$|Switching (either {{moving from}} track to track or to/from Monorail Shop): When moving trains from one beam to another, other trains on both lines were {{required}} to hold outside of the block (or section) containing the switch. Trains being moved were emptied of guests and the entire process was controlled by way of clearance delivered by radio between the switch beam operator (who stood under the switch), the train operator, and Monorail Base (the lead at TTC). At that time Monorail Base had responsibility of oversight for the entire system (Monorail Concourse now has the duty). The entire process is carefully coordinated and executed. To engage the train's motors during a switching operation, the pilot must override the automatic anti-collision system throughout (MAPO) the entire switch.
