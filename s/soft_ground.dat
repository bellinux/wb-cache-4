5|$|On 11 July 1965. Avro 748 G-ARMV of Skyways Coach-Air {{arriving}} from Beauvais was written off at Lympne when its nose-wheels dug into <b>soft</b> <b>ground</b> {{on the grass}} runway. The aircraft flipped over, losing its port wing in the process.|$|E
5|$|Clowes {{assigned}} the inexperienced 7th Infantry Brigade a defensive role, guarding key points around Milne Bay from seaborne or airborne attack, {{and kept the}} veteran 18th Infantry Brigade in reserve, ready to counterattack. Lacking accurate maps and finding that their signals equipment was unreliable in the conditions, the Australian command and control system consisted largely of cable telephones, or where {{there was not enough}} line available, runners. The <b>soft</b> <b>ground</b> made movement by road and even on foot difficult.|$|E
5|$|Duke of Marmalade did {{not appear}} again until the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October, {{for which he was}} made 4/1 second {{favourite}} despite O'Brien expressing concern over the <b>soft</b> <b>ground.</b> He was settled on the outside, but when Murtagh attempted to have him move forward in the straight, he made no progress and finished seventh of the sixteen runners behind Zarkava.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for prediction of consolidation settlements of <b>soft</b> <b>grounds.</b> The method {{is based on}} the theoretical result which shows that the settlement velocity of <b>soft</b> <b>grounds</b> non-improved or improved with sand drains decreases exponentially with time. Final settlements can be easily derived from the regression analysis for the relationship between the elapsed time and the observed settlement velocity. The method has advantages of its simplicity and capability to give the satisfactorily good estimate of the consolidation settlements, and also the support of the theoretical background...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{property}} {{investigation of}} <b>soft</b> <b>grounds</b> {{in the earlier}} non-investigated range of pressures is {{the aim of the}} paper as well as the parameter determination of one of deformation models and the estimation of its adequacy to the ground behaviour. As a result the modification of Kolsky's method has been suggested and its substantiation for <b>soft</b> <b>grounds</b> has been held. Curve lines of the dynamic compressibility of ground mediums in the non-investigated range of pressure have been obtained. The equipment of a model and the estimation of its adequacy to the ground behaviour have been held. The complex of experimental methods for the investigation of dynamic properties of <b>soft</b> <b>grounds</b> and granular mediums has been elaborated. Curve lines of the dynamic compressibility of clays, loams, sand loams, sand and plasticine have been obtained. The investigation results are being used in the calculation practice of All-Russian Experimental Physics R and D Institute.

5|$|Laying pipe {{took several}} stages. First, {{the right of}} way had to be cleared with chainsaws, bulldozers, and {{scrapers}} who followed the rough route laid out by the initial surveyors. These crews were followed by another group of surveyors and engineers who determined whether the pipeline could be laid in the planned spot, or if it had to be moved because of permafrost, <b>soft</b> <b>ground,</b> or other considerations. State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, could give the OK to move the path of the pipeline as much as 200 feet to the right or left in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E
5|$|The Kerry Bog Pony is a {{mountain}} and moorland breed of pony that originated in Ireland. Possibly {{descended from the}} Irish Hobby horse, it originally lived a mainly feral existence in the peat bogs {{of what is now}} County Kerry in southwestern Ireland. Local inhabitants used the ponies as pack and cart horses for transporting peat and kelp to the villages. The breed developed physical characteristics including a low weight-to-height ratio and an unusual footfall pattern, which helped it move on <b>soft</b> <b>ground</b> such as peat bogs. The ponies were known for hardiness and an ability to survive in harsh conditions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} {{the ninth}} inning, Tigers' center fielder Austin Jackson {{executed}} an over-the-shoulder catch on the run to retire Cleveland's Mark Grudzielanek for the first out and preserve the perfect game, a play that has been compared to DeWayne Wise's leaping catch at the wall in the ninth-inning that preserved Mark Buehrle's perfect game in 2009. Mike Redmond grounded out to make the second out of the inning. Jason Donald then hit a <b>soft</b> <b>ground</b> ball that first baseman Miguel Cabrera had to range far to his right to retrieve. Donald was ruled safe, giving him an infield single, but video replay showed that Cabrera's throw to Galarraga, who was covering first base, beat Donald to the bag. Donald advanced to second and third base on defensive indifference during Trevor Crowe's at-bat, until Crowe grounded out to Brandon Inge, ending the game in a 3–0 victory for the Tigers.|$|E
50|$|When {{trackers}} come to hard, stony ground, where {{tracks are}} {{virtually impossible to}} discern, apart from the odd small pebble that has been overturned, they may move around the patch of hard ground {{in order to find}} the spoor in <b>softer</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{half mile}} track was renovated in 1862, moved {{slightly}} to <b>softer</b> <b>ground</b> and renamed 'Willows Trotting Park' but the increasing {{value of the}} land for housing proved too much. The final horse race was run at Union Race Course on July 18, 1863.|$|R
50|$|The {{effects of}} the quake {{depended}} on the ground on which buildings stood. On the <b>softer</b> <b>ground</b> of Baihe and Dongshan, Tainan, concrete structures fared better than wooden ones, whereas on the harder earth of Nanxi and Yujing the reverse was true, with concrete buildings suffering more damage.|$|R
5|$|All fifteen Hamilcars which {{participated in}} the first lift on 17 September arrived over the landing zones safely, but {{problems}} were experienced {{when they came in}} to land. Two of the gliders landed on <b>soft</b> <b>ground,</b> which caused them to rapidly decelerate; this, combined with the majority of their equipment being {{in the front of the}} gliders, resulted in them flipping onto their backs. Three of the pilots were killed and the fourth was badly wounded and later taken prisoner, and several passengers were wounded; the 17-pounder anti-tank guns on board the gliders were damaged beyond repair. The rest of the Hamilcars landed successfully, although one overran the landing zone and hit a railway embankment; this damaged the two Universal Carriers being carried by the glider, although both were later salvaged. The lift on 18 September was delayed for several hours due to poor weather conditions, and the glider force did not take off until approximately 11:00. En route to the landing zones, one Hamilcar was forced to cast off and land at an airfield in England after its tow aircraft developed engine trouble, and another ditched in the English Channel when its tug developed engine troubles as well; both had been carrying 17-pounder anti-tank guns. The rest of the Hamilcars encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire as they landed, with several being hit. As a result, one Hamilcar landed short of the landing zone after being hit in the wing, and another was forced to make an emergency landing far from the landing zone after being hit; the stores, pilots and passengers were captured by German forces shortly after the glider landed. The rest of the Hamilcars landed successfully. The third lift on 19 September did not take place due to weather problems, and because several of 1st Airborne Division's landing zones had been overrun. Finally on 21 September the weather cleared, but due to 1st Airborne Division's deteriorating situation it was decided that the 878th Aviation Engineer Battalion would not be delivered. As such, only a single Hamilcar accompanied 1st Polish Independent Parachute Brigade when it set off for its drop near the town of Driel; this was the same Hamilcar which had been forced to land in England on 19 September when its tug had experienced engine trouble. However, the tow rope between the glider and tug snapped over Belgium, and it was forced to land near Ghent.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface of}} road races is highly {{important}} and the IAAF dictate that the courses must be along man-made roads, bicycle paths or footpaths. Courses set along major roads of cities {{are typical of}} road running events, and traffic is usually cordoned off from the area during the competition. While <b>soft</b> <b>ground,</b> such as grass, is generally avoided, races may start and finish on <b>soft</b> <b>ground</b> or within a track and field stadium. Road racing courses come in two primary types: looped and point-to-point. Courses may be measured and designed to cover a standardised distance, such as , or they may simply follow a set route between two landmarks.|$|E
25|$|On 18 October 1983, a Lufthansa Boeing 747 {{freighter}} abandoned takeoff after engine no. 2 malfunctioned, {{probably at}} speed exceeding V1 (the takeoff/abort decision point). The aircraft overran the runway onto <b>soft</b> <b>ground</b> and sustained severe damage. 3 were injured.|$|E
40|$|Energy {{storage is}} very limited in AUV's. To assist with energy management, data {{gathering}} missions have been proposed where the vehicle should sit {{on the bottom and}} gather acoustic/video/chemical data over extended periods of time. In this grounding scenario while thrusters may be used, they are less desirable because of their high energy consumption and restricted use close to the ocean floor. The purpose of this work is to study a low cost, simple <b>soft</b> <b>grounding</b> capability for a submersible vehicle using controllable ballast. The ballast system based on the NPS Phoenix AUV is designed to control weight addition into or out of two ballast tanks. The developed control law adjusts the pump flow rate keeping the pitch angle and depth rate within the limits. Results for a <b>soft</b> <b>grounding</b> operation have been obtained using simulation. Turkish Navy author...|$|R

Bridge pier moving is not {{a popular}} problem in <b>soft</b> clay <b>ground</b> section of highway but this problem is found in parts of bridge piers in Leqing section of NING-TAI-WEN expressway, which is used plastic drain bar {{to deal with the}} <b>soft</b> clay <b>ground.</b> By {{monitoring}} the bridge pier displacement and the data getting from observation of subgrade settlement this paper establishes the relation curve of subgrade settlement and bridge pier displacement and, by analyzing the characters of <b>soft</b> clay <b>ground</b> and the force acting on pile foundation, gets the reasons and presents suggestions to solve the problem...|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} 1983, Opale {{was given}} a rating of 105 by the {{independent}} Timeform organisation and was described as being likely to be suited by longer distances and <b>softer</b> <b>ground.</b> In the British Free Handicap for three-year-olds, she was given a rating of 61, making her 30 pounds inferior to the top-rated filly Habibti.|$|R
25|$|This {{metallic}} {{bearing support}} may be adapted, with certain precautions, as a seismic isolator to skyscrapers and buildings on <b>soft</b> <b>ground.</b> Recently, {{it has been}} employed {{under the name of}} Metallic Roller Bearing for a housing complex (17 stories) in Tokyo, Japan.|$|E
25|$|The United States did not supply M80 armor-piercing rounds for the autocannons of Soviet P-39s—instead, the Soviets {{received}} 1,232,991 M54 high-explosive rounds, {{which they}} used primarily for air-to-air combat and against <b>soft</b> <b>ground</b> targets. The VVS {{did not use}} the P-39 for tank-busting duties.|$|E
25|$|Little spotted kiwis eat grubs {{and other}} small insects that are found underground, and {{occasionally}} eat berries. Hence the sharp talons and long beak, it digs into the ground with its talons then shoves its long beak down the <b>soft</b> <b>ground.</b> Since they can't fly to get to insects or food on trees and their eyesight is very poor they depend on {{a keen sense of}} smell, long beak and talons.|$|E
50|$|After racing on good to {{firm ground}} {{for most of}} the season, Red Evie ended her {{campaign}} in the Sun Chariot Stakes on <b>softer</b> <b>ground</b> at Newmarket in October. She began to struggle before half way and was eased down by Spencer to finish tailed-off last of the five runners behind Peeress, Soviet Song, Alexander Goldrun and Musicanna.|$|R
50|$|The nests are burrowed {{into the}} ground in loam soil. Halictus rubicundus has a high {{tolerance}} for soil hardness. Soil hardness affects the density of nesting. Females prefer to nest in <b>softer</b> <b>ground</b> as they spend less energy and time excavating the nest. Unlike the similar species Lasioglossum zephyrum that build nests {{in close proximity to}} each other, this sweat bee prefers to spread out. Foundresses will choose to build their nests in patches of <b>softer</b> <b>ground</b> until they reach the critical nearest-neighbor distance of about 50 mm, at which point the close spacing poses a high risk of the nests collapsing. At this point, further foundresses would be forced to build their nests in harder soils where the nests could be built closer together without compromising nest architecture. Foundresses may test the hardness of the soil by biting into the surface or performing a short test dig.|$|R
50|$|Concrete {{offshore}} structures show an excellent performance. They are highly durable, constructed of almost maintenance-free material, suitable for harsh and/or arctic environment (like ice and seismic regions), can carry heavy topsides, often offer storage capacities, {{are suitable for}} <b>soft</b> <b>grounds</b> and are very economical for water depths larger than 150m. Most gravity-type platforms need no additional fixing because of their large foundation dimensions and extremely high weight.|$|R
25|$|The {{assault on}} Urgench {{proved to be}} the most {{difficult}} battle of the Mongol invasion. The city was built along the river Amu Darya in a marshy delta area. The <b>soft</b> <b>ground</b> did not lend itself to siege warfare, and {{there was a lack of}} large stones for the catapults. The Mongols attacked regardless, and the city fell only after the defenders put up a stout defense, fighting block for block. Mongolian casualties were higher than normal, due to the unaccustomed difficulty of adapting Mongolian tactics to city fighting.|$|E
25|$|On tilled soil a {{one-piece}} roller has {{the disadvantage}} that when turning corners the outer {{end of the}} roller has to rotate much faster than the inner end, forcing one or both ends to skid. A one-piece roller turned on <b>soft</b> <b>ground</b> will skid up a heap of soil at the outer radius, leaving heaps, which is counter-productive. Rollers are often made {{in two or three}} sections to reduce this problem, and the Cambridge roller overcomes it altogether by mounting many small segments onto one axle so that they can each rotate at local ground-speed.|$|E
25|$|The horse {{should have}} a reduced {{workload}} for 1–3 weeks. If a trainer does not decrease the workload sufficiently, and the splint bone continues to receive concussion, the injury {{is likely to continue}} or worsen. Light exercise on <b>soft</b> <b>ground</b> is best for a horse with splints, as work can help encourage the needed bone growth to heal the splint. Those trainers concerned with the cosmetic appearance of their horse usually prefer to hand-walk twice daily and keep the animal stalled until the splint is resolved, eliminating the chance that the splint will accidentally be knocked during work and the swelling increased.|$|E
50|$|Most of the National Hunt season {{takes place}} in the winter when the <b>softer</b> <b>ground</b> makes jumping less dangerous. The horses are much cheaper, as the {{majority}} are geldings and have no breeding value. This makes the sport more popular as the horses are not usually retired {{at such a young age}} and thus become familiar to the racing public over a number of seasons.|$|R
50|$|In August Prohibit {{started at}} odds of 12/1 in the Nunthorpe Stakes on <b>softer</b> <b>ground</b> at York Racecourse. The fifteen runners split into groups {{on either side}} of course and {{although}} Prohibit finished first among the horses on the far-side (the left-hand side from the jockey's viewpoint) he was beaten into third by the outsiders Margot Did and Hamish McGonagall who raced up {{the opposite side of the}} course.|$|R
50|$|The whole weapon weighed some 50 {{kilograms}} and it {{was usually}} towed by horses, but when stripped down could be carried by several men. The rifle had adjustable iron sights calibrated between 200 and 1,400 meters and was equipped with unusual dual bipod, with two sets of legs, one with spikes for use on hard ground {{and the other with}} skids for use on <b>softer</b> <b>ground</b> or snow.|$|R
25|$|Gorytus {{made his}} first {{appearance}} as a three-year-old in the 2000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course on 30 April. He looked extremely impressive in the paddock and was made second favourite in the betting at odds of 7/2 {{in a field of}} sixteen runners. He briefly disputed the lead before fading into fifth place behind Lomond, Tolomeo, Muscatite and Kuwait Tower. Plans to run the colt in the Derby were abandoned because of the extremely <b>soft</b> <b>ground</b> and he was ruled out of a run in the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot after developing a respiratory infection.|$|E
25|$|The type of {{railroad}} tie {{used on the}} predecessors of the first true railway (Liverpool and Manchester Railway) consisted {{of a pair of}} stone blocks laid into the ground, with the chairs holding the rails fixed to those blocks. One advantage of this method of construction was that it allowed horses to tread the middle path without the risk of tripping. In railway use with ever heavier locomotives, it was found that it was hard to maintain the correct gauge. The stone blocks were in any case unsuitable on <b>soft</b> <b>ground,</b> such as at Chat Moss, where timber ties had to be used. Bi-block ties with a tie rod are somewhat similar.|$|E
25|$|The American {{lines were}} {{backed up by}} {{impressive}} artillery support. The 3rd Panzer Grenadier Division hit the left or north side of Elsenborn ridge from the Schwalm Creek valley against 99th Infantry Division. But their tanks found the <b>soft</b> <b>ground</b> almost impassible, and one after another the Sturmgeschütz III assault guns bogged down, making them easy prey for the American artillery. On 20 December, the Pz Abt 103 lost a total of fifteen StuG III. Twelve of them bogged {{down in front of}} the Elsenborn Ridge, the others ran onto mines inside Krinkelt and Rocherath. The Germans attacked for a second time on the 20th. All these attacks were repelled with heavy losses.|$|E
5000|$|On 13 May 2010, again ridden by Ryan Moore, Workforce {{finished}} second in the Derby warm-up race the Dante Stakes at York. Losing by more than three lengths to Cape Blanco, the performance was said to have been affected by his metal bit becoming displaced. Trainer Stoute also suggested Workforce would have preferred slightly <b>softer</b> <b>ground</b> in the race, pointing out he was still [...] "a once-raced baby".|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A membrane-beam-elastic element {{mechanical}} {{model of}} a lightweight composite heavy roadway, which is used on <b>soft</b> slimy <b>ground,</b> is built and its mechanical behaviors under loads are simulated by a large commercial finite element analysis software. The structural style which deformation is minimum under same loads is found, and numerical results are accorded with test ones, can meet the required precision and show reliability of the numerical calculation model. The commercial software {{can be used to}} simulate actual static strength situation of the lightweight composite heavy roadway and explore structural style of new roadway. Research shows that lightweight composite heavy roadway which can guarantee heavy vehicles pass in the <b>soft</b> slimy <b>ground</b> conditions make a significant technological breakthrough.
