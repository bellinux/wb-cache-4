50|$|The {{main part}} of the {{insulator}} is typically made from sintered alumina, a very hard ceramic material with high dielectric strength, printed with the manufacturer's name and identifying marks, then glazed to improve resistance to surface <b>spark</b> <b>tracking.</b> Its major functions are to provide mechanical support and electrical insulation for the central electrode, while also providing an extended spark path for flashover protection. This extended portion, particularly in engines with deeply recessed plugs, helps extend the terminal above the cylinder head so as to make it more readily accessible.A further feature of sintered alumina is its good heat conduction - reducing the tendency for the insulator to glow with heat and so light the mixture prematurely.|$|E

30|$|Spark [8] is a {{general-purpose}} cluster computing system. Initially {{developed at}} Berkeley and currently an Apache project, Spark is widely adopted in batch and stream processing applications that involve {{large volumes of}} data, also thanks to the availability of several application-specific libraries. Spark stores data in resilient distributed datasets (RDDs), a read-only, lazily evaluated, partitioned collections of records. RDDs are persisted on a distributed file system for fault tolerance and can be cached in main memory to enable low-latency computations. <b>Spark</b> keeps <b>track</b> of how RDDs are computed. If an RDD is lost due to some failure, its value is recomputed through the RDDs it depends on. This guarantees exactly once semantics even {{in the presence of}} node failures.|$|R

The tracks of secondary particles from neutrino interactions in the emulsion {{were observed in}} the spark chamber. The <b>spark</b> chamber <b>tracks</b> were used to locate the tracks produced by the same particles in the emulsion. These tracks were then followed back in the emulsion to the neutrino interaction in which they originate. Of a total of seven neutrino interactions expected to be produced in the emulsion stack during this exposure four were located in this way and their characteristics studied. © 1965 Società Italiana di Fisica.

The office domain has a rich set of tasks associated with it, and the Calo system will learn from the user in a variety of ways. One important way is to learn from instruction: to be able to modify its behavior based on one or two sentences from the user that describe the required change. We are developing the Tailor system to interpret a user sentence about a desired behavior change based on an understanding of the tasks, a model of possible changes, a constructive search process to interpret the user’s sentence and an explicit analysis to check that the proposed change leads to a correct, working system.

The paper explores the uses and pitfalls of modeling and simulation with this case study. While a working model remained elusive, several important observations emerged.

It peaked at number 48 on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and number forty on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales. The <b>track</b> <b>sparked</b> debate on the legality of unauthorized sampling when James Brown sued to prevent the duo's use of his music. PopMatters' Mark Anthony Neal called it [...] "the most danceable hip-hop recording" [...] of 1986. According to Touré of The New York Times, [...] "It is Rakim's verbal dexterity {{as well as his}} calm, deep voice and dark tone that has made this song a rap classic: 'I came in the door/ I said it before/ I'll never let the mic magnetize me no more/ But it's bitin' me/ Fightin' me/ Invitin' me to rhyme/ I can't hold it back/ I'm looking for the line/ Takin' off my coat/ Clearin' my throat/ The rhyme will be kickin' it/ Til I hit my last note.'" [...] The second single, [...] "I Ain't No Joke", peaked at number 38 on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. Described as one of the album's [...] "monumental singles", Michael Di Bella wrote in the All Music Guide to Rock that [...] "Rakim grabs the listener by the throat and illustrates his mastery of the rhyming craft".|$|R
5000|$|In early June 1879, when it {{appeared}} the issue {{was about to be}} resolved in favor of the Rio Grande, Masterson hurriedly returned by special train with 60 men, taking up a key position at the defensible Santa Fe roundhouse in Pueblo. An injunction on June 10, 1879, from a local court restraining the Santa Fe from operating on Rio Grande <b>track</b> <b>sparked</b> an armed retaking of their railroad the next day by Rio Grande crews. Robert F. Weitbrec, former construction foreman and now treasurer of the company, and chief engineer John A. McMurtrie brought 100 men to Pueblo. They met with Pueblo County Sheriff Henly R. Price and Town Marshal Pat Desmond on the best means to serve the writ and dispossess Masterson's men of the roundhouse. Weitbrec suggested they [...] "borrow" [...] a cannon from the state armory only to find that Masterson had already taken it and reportedly trained it from the roundhouse down the street approach. McMurtrie and Desmond gathered 50 Rio Grande men in front of the Victoria Hotel and distributed rifles and ammunition. They marched to the railroad platform, broke down the door to the telegraph office, and when shots were fired, Masterson's men fled through the back windows, cutting him off from any communication with his employers. Supposedly when confronted with the re-borrowed cannon, Masterson's men surrendered the roundhouse.|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{streamer}} <b>spark</b> chambers, or <b>track</b> chambers, {{have been}} described in the literature. "lo We have constructed such chambers, and describe some properties that have been observed. Such chambers are interesting in that tracks can be recorded for charged particles which pass in them in any arbi-trary direction. In this sense the streamer chamber {{is similar to a}} bubble chamber, with the basic differences that it can be triggered on interesting events and the operating medium is a gas rather than a liquid. Figure 1 shows the general test setup we have used in the studies. A ten stage Marx generator, capable of supplying up to a QOkV pulse, drives one;. plate of a two electrode spark chamber. The sensitive volume of the chamber. was 27 cm X 27 cm with a 12. 5 cm gap. In order to allow photography through the plates, one of the electrodes was either conducting glass (Corning Glass Works) or a wire mesh made of 0. 3 rmn diameter wire strands spaced 6 mm apart. The chamber operated equally well for the two cases. A mirror was placed beside the chamber to allow photography of both the front view (along the E field) and the 'side view (perpendicular to the E field) on the same film. Counters placed above and below the chamber define the passage of charged particles through the chamber, and their coirdidence pulses provide trigger pulses for the Marx generator. The minimum time delay between the passsge of the particle and the application of the high voltage pulse on the chamber was 150 nsec. Work supported by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission...|$|R
