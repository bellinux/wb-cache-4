5|$|Finally, <b>selection</b> can be {{classified}} according to the resource being competed for. Sexual <b>selection</b> results from competition for mates. Sexual <b>selection</b> typically proceeds via fecundity <b>selection,</b> sometimes {{at the expense of}} viability. Ecological <b>selection</b> is natural <b>selection</b> via any means other than sexual <b>selection,</b> such as kin <b>selection,</b> competition, and infanticide. Following Darwin, natural <b>selection</b> is sometimes defined as ecological <b>selection,</b> in which case sexual <b>selection</b> is considered a separate mechanism.|$|E
5|$|A {{population}} ecology concept is r/K <b>selection</b> theory, {{one of the}} first predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history evolution. The premise behind the r/K <b>selection</b> model is that natural <b>selection</b> pressures change according to population density. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid population growth. These early phases of population growth experience density-independent forces of natural <b>selection,</b> which is called r-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural <b>selection,</b> called K-selection.|$|E
5|$|A {{special case}} of natural <b>selection</b> is sexual <b>selection,</b> which is <b>selection</b> for any trait that {{increases}} mating success {{by increasing the}} attractiveness of an organism to potential mates. Traits that evolved through sexual <b>selection</b> are particularly prominent among males of several animal species. Although sexually favoured, traits such as cumbersome antlers, mating calls, large body size and bright colours often attract predation, which compromises the survival of individual males. This survival disadvantage is balanced by higher reproductive success in males that show these hard-to-fake, sexually selected traits.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, <b>selection</b> can {{be divided}} {{according}} to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative <b>selection</b> acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing <b>selection</b> acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, {{even in the absence}} of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent <b>selection.</b> One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} <b>selection</b> by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) <b>selection,</b> which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) <b>selection,</b> which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of <b>selection.</b> Thus viability and survival <b>selection</b> may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity <b>selection</b> may be split into additional sub-components including sexual <b>selection,</b> gametic <b>selection,</b> acting on gamete survival, and compatibility <b>selection,</b> acting on zygote formation.|$|E
5|$|Artificial <b>selection</b> is the {{intentional}} <b>selection</b> of traits {{in a population}} of organisms. This {{has been used for}} thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals. More recently, such <b>selection</b> has become a vital part of genetic engineering, with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate DNA. Proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and <b>selection</b> (for example modified enzymes and new antibodies) in a process called directed evolution.|$|E

5|$|Background <b>selection</b> is the {{opposite}} of a selective sweep. If a specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying <b>selection,</b> linked variation tends to be weeded out along with it, producing a region in the genome of low overall variability. Because background <b>selection</b> is a result of deleterious new mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it does not produce clear blocks of linkage disequilibrium, although with low recombination it can still lead to slightly negative linkage disequilibrium overall.|$|E
