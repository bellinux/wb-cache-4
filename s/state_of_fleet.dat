40|$|The {{contribution}} {{studies the}} composition of motor vehicle fleet in the Czech Republic. The current <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>fleet</b> is discussed and the age indicator of the respective categories of the Czech fleet is stressed. Average age of the categories of passenger cars, trucks, buses and motorcycles is identified using the results obtained through the analyses of numerical characteristics of the fleet. The article discusses passenger cars and trucks in more detail because these are the groups representing the largest proportions within the fleet in the Czech Republic. The evaluation of the Czech fleet {{is followed by the}} identification of key characteristics of fleets in the EU member states. In conclusion, the need for debate over this topic in the Czech Republic is stressed as well as the necessity of finding ways to decrease {{the average age of the}} Czech fleet in the view of negative environmental aspects related to its high average age...|$|E

5000|$|The proper rank <b>of</b> <b>fleet</b> admiral {{was created}} in 1944 {{in order to give}} United States {{military}} officers comparable rank to five-star officers of allied nations. The rank <b>of</b> <b>fleet</b> admiral was created by Congress to be granted to four people during the World War II era. The United <b>States</b> rank <b>of</b> <b>fleet</b> admiral was created by an Act of Congress for four officers to hold on a temporary basis under Pub.L. 78-482 on December 14, 1944. The rank was made permanent for the four individual holders by [...] on March 23, 1946, but that law made no provision to establish the rank itself permanently. Although Congress authorized the promotion of Omar Bradley to the five-star rank of general of the Army in 1950 while serving as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff so that he would be of the same rank as General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, the theater commander in Korea, there has been no new legislation authorizing the use of the rank <b>of</b> <b>fleet</b> admiral since 1946.|$|R
40|$|The {{co-ordination}} {{of multiple}} automated guided vehicles (AGVs) {{is one of}} the main issues to address for the implementation of an efficient autonomous warehouse. Traffic jams are highly undesirable and, therefore, the motion of the AGVs should be planned by considering the current and future <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fleet.</b> This letter proposes a probabilistic model of the traffic in an autonomous warehouse to predict the evolution of possibly congested areas. Such a model is then exploited for building a predictive planner that is embedded in the traffic manager recently proposed in [1] to explicitely consider the evolution of the traffic up to a given horizon and to increase the efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>fleet</b> <b>of</b> AGVs in terms of delivery time.

5|$|Much of our {{information}} about the first Marshalsea is about the prison in the early 18th-century, courtesy of three sources. John Baptist Grano (1692 – c. 1748), one of George Frederick Handel's trumpeters at the opera house in London's Haymarket, was jailed there for a debt of £99 (£ today), and kept a detailed diary, A Journal of My Life inside the Marshalsea, of his 458-day incarceration from 30 May 1728 until 23 September 1729. The other two key sources are a 1729 report by a parliamentary committee, led by James Oglethorpe MP, on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Fleet</b> and the Marshalsea, and the subsequent murder trial that year of William Acton, the Marshalsea's chief jailor.|$|R

60|$|The British admiral, {{seeing his}} {{arrangements}} and divining his object, pressed on, regardless <b>of</b> the scattered <b>state</b> <b>of</b> his <b>fleet,</b> {{and made the}} signal for each ship to attack as she came up. Another signal intimated that he should attempt to break the enemy’s line, so as to get {{between it and the}} land. But this signal was not generally seen by the fleet. It was, however, seen and acted upon by the second in command, Admiral Onslow, in the Monarch, who soon after led the larboard division through the Dutch line, three ships from the rear, and then closely engaged the Jupiter. Duncan’s own ship, the Venerable, the leading ship of the starboard division, marked out the Vryhide, De Winter’s flagship, as his own antagonist.|$|R
60|$|The Spaniards {{had still}} {{eighteen}} or nineteen ships which had suffered {{little or no}} injury: that part <b>of</b> the <b>fleet</b> which had been separated from the main body in the morning was now coming up, and Sir John Jervis made signal to bring to. His ships could not have formed without abandoning those which they had captured, and running to leeward: the CAPTAIN was lying a perfect wreck on board her two prizes; {{and many of the}} other vessels were so shattered in their masts and rigging as to be wholly unmanageable. The Spanish admiral meantime, according to his official account, being altogether undecided in his own opinion respecting the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fleet,</b> inquired <b>of</b> his captains whether it was proper to renew the action; nine of them answered explicitly that it was not; others replied that it was expedient to delay the business.

40|$|Mobility on Demand {{is a new}} {{transportation}} paradigm {{aimed to}} provide sustainable transportation in urban settings with a <b>fleet</b> <b>of</b> electric vehicles. Usage scenarios prpopsed by Mobility on Demand systems must allow one-way rentals. However, one-way rentals bring significant challenges to fleet management because areas of high demand will tend to lose their inventory, whereas areas of low demand will tend to accumulate inventory. Dynamic incentives can be provided to encourage different usage patterns and alleviate the problem of demand asymmetry. This thesis proposes a dynamic incentive scheme for rental vehicle fleet management {{in the context of}} Mobility on Demand. Simulation using Vienna taxi data shows the scheme to be effective at maintaining the equalibrium <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fleet.</b> It holds great promise to be incorporated in a real-world deployment of Mobility on Demand system. by SiZhi Zhou.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} {{consisted}} in demonstrating how physical and operational characteristics in federal highways, both punctual and sistemic, propitiate the occurrence of traffic accidents with victims, and how the data base on traffic accidents of the Federal Road Policy (Datatran) can be used to guide agile and efficient field research, resulting in fast identification of contributing factors and in the elaboration of recommendations for its elimination or reduction. Field research was carried through in two selected highways: BR- 116 and BR- 324. The results showed many inadequate characteristics of federal highways that contribute to accidents. With this, it was possible to develop a methodology for identifying contributing factors to accidents, which are directly {{under the control of the}} managing entity of the highway, and that could be reduced or eliminated, resulting in the reduction of wounded victims and deceased, without the necessary envolvement of other entities, and without change in users? behavior and in the operational <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fleet</b> <b>of</b> vehicles...|$|R

60|$|He {{went down}} principally {{at the request}} of Cecil {{and other members of the}} council, who, knowing that he was a {{favourite}} of the queen, thought that his representations as to the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fleet</b> might do more than they could do to influence her to send supplies to the distressed sailors. The earl visited the ships lying in the mouth of the Tamar, and three times started in a boat to go out to those in the Sound; but the sea was so rough, and he was so completely prostrated by sickness, that he had each time to put back. What he saw, however, on board the ships he visited, and heard from Lord Howard as to the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> those at sea, was quite sufficient. He at once expended a considerable amount of money in buying wine and fresh meat for the sick, and then hurried away to London to lay before the queen the result of his personal observations, and to implore her to order provisions to be immediately despatched to the fleet.|$|R
