5|$|All {{types of}} cooking {{involved}} the direct use of fire. Kitchen stoves {{did not appear}} until the 18th century, and cooks had {{to know how to}} cook directly over an open fire. Ovens were used, but they were expensive to construct and only existed in fairly large households and bakeries. It was common for a community to have <b>shared</b> <b>ownership</b> of an oven to ensure that the bread baking essential to everyone was made communal rather than private. There were also portable ovens designed to be filled with food and then buried in hot coals, and even larger ones on wheels that were used to sell pies in the streets of medieval towns. But for most people, almost all cooking was done in simple stewpots, since this was the most efficient use of firewood and did not waste precious cooking juices, making potages and stews the most common dishes. Overall, most evidence suggests that medieval dishes had a fairly high fat content, or at least when fat could be afforded. This was considered less of a problem in a time of back-breaking toil, famine, and a greater acceptance—even desirability—of plumpness; only the poor or sick, and devout ascetics, were thin.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century the District and Metropolitan {{railways}} faced increased competition in central London from new, electric, deep-level tube lines. The City & South London Railway had been a great success when it opened in 1890. After the opening of the Central London Railway in 1900 from Shepherd's Bush to the City with a flat rate fare of 2d, the District and Metropolitan together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900. The use of steam propulsion led to smoke-filled stations and carriages that were unpopular with passengers and electrification was seen as the way forward. However, electric traction was still in its infancy and agreement would be needed with the Metropolitan because of the <b>shared</b> <b>ownership</b> of the inner circle. A jointly owned train of six coaches successfully ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900. Tenders were then requested and in 1901 a Metropolitan and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. Initially this was accepted by both parties.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} main strands of {{research}} on employee <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> over the last forty years. It considers research findings {{in the literature on}} types of <b>share</b> <b>ownership,</b> the incidence of <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> plans, the ‘determinants’ of the use of share plans by companies, influences upon employee participation in share plans, the effect of <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> on employee attitudes and behaviour, the effect on company performance, and the relationship between <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> plans and other forms of employee participation. The paper does not provide a comprehensive review of the literature on these topics: instead it highlights the main findings that have emerged in the literature to date, and suggests some avenues for future research. It is suggested that majority worker ownership is different in character and effects from ‘mainstream’ minority employee share plans in large companies but the literature has tended to conflate the two. It is argued that future research needs to distinguish the various forms of employee <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> if the impact of <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> is to be more precisely calibrated. ...|$|R

With the opening in 1900 of the Central London Railway from Shepherd's Bush to the City with a flat fare of 2d, the District and the Met together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900. The polluted atmosphere in the tunnels was becoming increasingly unpopular with passengers and conversion to electric traction was seen as the way forward. Electrification had been considered by the Met as early as the 1880s, but such a method of traction was still in its infancy, and agreement would be needed with the District because of the <b>shared</b> <b>ownership</b> of the Inner Circle. A jointly owned train of six coaches ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900. This was considered a success, tenders were requested and in 1901 a Met and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. This was accepted by both parties until the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) took control of the District. The UERL was led by the American Charles Yerkes, whose experience in the United States led him to favour DC with a third rail similar to that on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade a DC system with four rails was taken up and the railways began electrifying using multiple-unit stock and electric locomotives hauling carriages.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> and firm performance {{as well as the}} relationship between managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> and dividends in Australia. Agency theory, more specifically two alternative theories – incentive alignment and managerial entrenchment theory – provides the theoretical framework that underpins this thesis. The three empirical studies in this thesis examine the top 300 Australian listed companies for the period 2000 to 2006 and the methodology is based on multivariate regression analysis. Most importantly, all of the studies consider the potential endogeneity of managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> as well as the simultaneity between managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> and performance, and managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> and dividends. There are several primary motivations for this thesis. First, it is argued that characteristics of the Australian legal system, ownership characteristics, market for corporate control, and other corporate governance features, mean that the Australian corporate governance system is markedly {{different from that of the}} US and the UK; these differences have the potential to impact the ownership-performance and ownership-dividends relationships examined. Second, much of the prior literature {{examines the}} relationship between managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> and performance using <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> by all the directors, and does not distinguish between <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> by the executive directors and by the non-executive directors, in particular, the independent directors. It is posited that executive directors and independent directors have different ownership-performance and ownership-dividends incentives and these are examined separately. Third, the Australian dividend imputation system has interesting implications for the ownership-dividends relationship this thesis examines. The first empirical study in this thesis investigates the relationship between managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> and performance measured by Tobin’s Q and earnings. This study finds a negative relationship followed by a positive relationship (U-shaped) between managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> and performance. It is also documented that the relationship is bidirectional, that is, performance also affects managerial ownership but only when it uses Tobin’s Q to measure performance. The study also documents a similar relationship for the executive directors’ <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> as for managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> as a whole. As posited, it does not find any relationship between <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> by the independent directors and performance. The second empirical study examines the relationship between managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> and discretionary accruals, as well as accrual adjusted earnings. The study finds a positive relationship followed by a negative relationship (inverse U-shaped) between managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> and the absolute value of discretionary accruals. It also finds that this relationship is driven by executive as opposed to independent directors’ <b>share</b> <b>ownership.</b> It then re-examines the relationship between managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> and performance measured by earnings adjusted for accruals. Once again a U-shaped relationship is documented between managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> and adjusted earnings. It is also documented that the relationship is bidirectional. The analysis for the executive directors reveals a similar relationship to that of managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> as a whole. Once again, no relationship is found between ownership by the independent directors and adjusted earnings. The third and final empirical study investigates the relationship between managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> and the likelihood of paying dividends as well as dividend payouts. It is found in this study that firms are more likely to pay dividends when managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership,</b> as well as ownership by the executive directors, is high. Related to this is a positive relationship documented between managerial <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> and dividend payouts as well as executive directors’ <b>share</b> <b>ownership</b> and dividend payouts. However, this study fails to find any significant relationship between ownership by the independent directors and dividends. Since the direction of causality may also be an issue, this study also investigates the simultaneous determination of managerial ownership and dividend payouts. It fails to find any simultaneous relationship between ownership by managers and dividend payouts. The thesis as a whole presents some unique and robust results relating to the ownership-performance and ownership-dividends relationships, which are argued to be a result of certain Australian institutional features that are clearly different to those in the US and the UK. The results also support the argument that executive directors and independent directors have different ownership-performance and ownership-dividends incentives, and suggest that independent directors may be immune to the theorised incentive alignment or entrenchment effects associated with <b>share</b> <b>ownership...</b>|$|R
