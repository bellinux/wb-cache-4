While some were considered novelties and produced simple tones, the Telharmonium accurately synthesized the sound of orchestral instruments. It achieved viable public interest and made commercial progress into <b>streaming</b> <b>music</b> through telephone networks.|$|E

It publishes 5,000 copies every other Monday during the fall and spring semesters, and every third Monday during the summer. It is distributed free around campus and at the UTD newsroom in the Student Union. The Mercury also publishes online at utdmercury.com. In April 2011, The Mercury won 12 awards at the 101st annual Texas Intercollegiate Press Association IPA convention. In 2004, another student newspaper named A Modest Proposal (AMP) was formed.

Any student, faculty, or staff of UTD {{can contribute to the}} paper. Copies of AMP are available for free at the first of each month around the campus, and can also be downloaded in PDF format from their website.

The nominations were for the following categories: Best Use of the Internet, Best Use of Limited Resources and Station of the Year. In 2009, UTD TV, an internet-based campus TV station, was founded and launched by students. Still in its infancy, it has already webcast a range of student-interest programs from campus news and amusing serial stories to student affairs coverage.|$|E
