50|$|It is also {{noteworthy}} {{that there are}} several airports with <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> {{that have not been}} assigned ICAO codes that do have IATA codes. For example, several airports in Alaska that have <b>scheduled</b> commercial <b>service,</b> such as Stebbins Airport or Nanwalek Airport. There are also airports with <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> for which there are ICAO codes but not IATA codes, such as Nkhotakota Airport/Tangole Airport/Dwanga Airport in Malawi or Chōfu Airport in Tokyo, Japan. Thus, neither system completely includes all airports with <b>scheduled</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2013, WestJet Encore {{announced}} regular <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> to Calgary and Vancouver, {{representing a}} major expansion of airline {{service to the}} Fort St. John market. <b>Scheduled</b> <b>service</b> to Vancouver is also provided by Air Canada Express.|$|R

5|$|Starting in 1946 the {{airfield}} {{was used by}} civil aviation during the construction of nearby Heathrow Airport. During this period, Northolt became a major base for British European Airways, which used the nearby Bourne School as its headquarters. Other airlines including Aer Lingus, Alitalia, Scandinavian Airlines System and Swissair used {{the airfield}} for <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> across Europe.|$|E
5|$|Besides running <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> and government-contracted {{flights to}} most {{villages in the}} country, the airline also {{supports}} remote research stations, provides charter services for tourists and Greenland's energy and mineral-resource industries and permits medivac during emergencies. Air Greenland has seven subsidiaries, an airline, hotels, tour operators, a travel agency specialized in Greenlandic tourism and the Arctic Umiaq Line, an unprofitable but government-subsidised ferry service.|$|E
5|$|Bringelandsåsen was {{proposed}} by the CAA in 1974. Plans were developed and in 1983 the Ministry of Transport and Communications recommended that Øyrane be closed and replaced with an all-new airport at Bringeland. Construction started in 1985 and the new airport opened on 31 August 1986, taking over all scheduled traffic from Øyrane. Widerøe started <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> to Oslo and Bergen, originally using de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and DHC-7 Dash 7 aircraft, of which the latter which was used to Oslo.|$|E
40|$|Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) {{provide new}} {{opportunities}} {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and exhaust emission. PEVs need to draw and store energy from an electrical grid to supply propulsive {{energy for the}} vehicle. As a result, {{it is important to know}} when PEVs batteries are available for charging and discharging. Furthermore, battery energy management and control is imperative for PEVs as the vehicle operation and even the safety of passengers depend on the battery system. Thus, scheduling the grid power electricity with parking lots would be needed for efficient charging and discharging of PEV batteries. This paper aims to propose a new intelligent battery energy management and control <b>scheduling</b> <b>service</b> charging that utilize Cloud computing networks. The proposed intelligent vehicle-to-grid <b>scheduling</b> <b>service</b> offers the computational scalability required to make decisions necessary to allow PEVs battery energy management systems to operate efficiently when the number of PEVs and charging devices are large. Experimental analyses of the proposed <b>scheduling</b> <b>service</b> as compared to a traditional <b>scheduling</b> <b>service</b> are conducted through simulations. The results show that the proposed intelligent battery energy management <b>scheduling</b> <b>service</b> substantially reduces the required number of interactions of PEV with parking lots and grid as well as predicting the load demand calculated in advance with regards to their limitations. Also it shows that the intelligent <b>scheduling</b> <b>service</b> charging using Cloud computing network is more efficient than the traditional <b>scheduling</b> <b>service</b> network for battery energy management and control...|$|R
50|$|As {{part of a}} major <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> expansion, Air Europe {{launched}} a new business class in 1988. This was accompanied {{by an increase in}} frequencies on most of its scheduled European trunk routes. It also introduced a new <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> aircraft type from late 1989.|$|R
50|$|In 1982 {{the company}} gained {{approval}} for <b>scheduled</b> <b>service,</b> {{leading to the}} company purchasing the name National Airlines from Pan American World Airways in anticipation of scheduled New York to Paris <b>service.</b> The <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> never materialized, although charter flights were flown on the route.|$|R
5|$|CHC Helikopter Service {{operates}} {{flights to}} the {{offshore oil platform}} at Norne on contract with Statoil. The oil company flies an average 55 people to the airport with various <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> and onwards to the oil field. In addition, the helicopter operator flies to various temporary oil rigs. It has two Sikorsky S-92 helicopters stationed at Brønnøysund. In 2011, there were 17,229 offshore helicopter passengers which traveled through Brønnøysund Airport.|$|E
5|$|The {{destinations}} in Asia {{were served}} from 1949 to 1954. Then, Braathens became a domestic airline, {{and did not}} have international <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> again until 1987, except during part of 1960. From 1994, the airline market was deregulated, and Braathens was free to operate domestically and within the European Economic Area. In 1997, it bought Transwede and started domestic services in Sweden, but these were terminated in 1999. The company merged with the Norwegian division of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) in 2004 to create SAS Braathens.|$|E
5|$|Widerøe reintroduced direct {{flights to}} Oslo on 10 May 2010. Statoil started using <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> {{instead of their}} {{previous}} charter flights on 2 January 2011. This caused Widerøe {{to increase the number}} of direct flights to Oslo to three per day on 1 April 2011. Widerøe introduced irregular charter flights to Manchester in April 2012, largely targeting English tourists traveling on holidays and Norwegian football patriots.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, Dan-Air began a <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> between Gatwick and Lisbon, {{its first}} <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> on a {{main trunk route}} between the UK and the Iberian peninsula. The same year, the airline joined the International Air Transport Association (IATA) as a Trade Association member.|$|R

5|$|Øyrane {{was served}} by Widerøe, which held the {{permission}} to operate all subsidized routes on the regional network. Widerøe served the airport with its fleet of 19-passenger de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft and provided flights to Bergen Airport, Flesland in multi-legged flights which included other towns in Sogn og Fjordane. Airlift and Førdefly were also {{based at the}} airport for periods, although neither operated any <b>scheduled</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
5|$|Business {{aviation}} {{has shown}} strong growth, although {{the numbers of}} aircraft on the UK register have declined. This reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign-registered business jets based in the UK, which {{are estimated to be}} growing in numbers. However, twin piston-engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly, reflecting pressures on the light air-taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper <b>scheduled</b> <b>services,</b> and a more sophisticated corporate charter business. The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools has declined, largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, the {{services}} were gradually {{taken over by}} Lufttransport, who used both small aircraft and helicopters. These gradually became more regular and became de facto <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> every fortnight. Lufttransport replaced the helicopter service with a two-engine five-seat aircraft in 1989, which cut the cost of transport significantly. In 1993, Widerøe established itself at Svalbard Airport and flew services to Ny-Ålesund, but this only lasted the one season. In 1996, Lufttransport and Kings Bay made an agreement that the airline would fly once per week during the winter and up to five times per week during the summer. The airline would use a Dornier Do 228, which was also used for flights from Longyearbyen to Svea Airport for Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani.|$|E

5|$|During the 1990s, JAL {{was hit by}} {{the effects}} of Japan's recession, {{increased}} foreign competition and the strengthening of the Japanese Yen, JAZ was given a new role to help reduce costs. The airline obtained the license to operate <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> on July 30, 1999 and would operate as a scheduled carrier on a wet-lease basis for JAL. It would operate on high-density low yield tourist routes in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly the Japan–Hawaii services; with a fleet of four McDonnell Douglas DC-10s and five Boeing 747s. On October 1, the airline {{changed its name to}} JALways Co., Ltd. and operated its first scheduled passenger service from Tokyo to Kona and Honolulu.|$|E
5|$|JAL Flight Academy (JFA) was {{established}} by Japan Airlines (JAL) in August 1989, as a flight training school subsidiary based at Omura Airport, Nagasaki. It provided conversion training for its flight engineers to become pilots. In April 1991, a new division of JFA was created to operate <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> to succeed the troubled Nishi Seto Airlink services, a commuter airline serving cities in western Japan. Since {{the introduction of the}} 19-seats Jetstream 31s (JS31) in September 1991, the aircraft progressively replaced the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante inherited from Nishi Seto.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} route through Innherred was largely without much debate, as the line {{naturally}} {{went through all}} the towns {{and most of the}} important villages. Sunnan was a natural place to halt construction, as it is located {{at the foot of the}} lake of Snåsavatnet, allowing connection with steam ships. <b>Scheduled</b> <b>services</b> on Snåsavatnet started in 1871 with SS Dina, which was replaced with SS Bonden in 1885. From 1904 to 1921, Bonden was supplemented with MS St. Olaf, although SS Bonden remained in corresponding service with the train until 1926.|$|E
50|$|ATS {{operates}} <b>scheduled</b> <b>service</b> to {{and from}} the area's two major airports, Haneda Airport and Narita International Airport, operating over 660 buses per day to Narita and over 550 to Haneda.

5|$|The list shows {{airports}} {{that have}} been served by Braathens {{as part of its}} <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> between 1949 and 2004. It excludes airports where Braathens only operated charter services. The list includes the city, country, the codes of the International Air Transport Association (IATA airport code) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO airport code), and the airport's name, with the airline's hubs marked. The list also contains the beginning and end year of services, with destinations marked if the services was not continual. IATA and ICAO codes are not given for airports which were closed or converted to general aviation before being issued such codes.|$|E
5|$|Widerøe {{operates}} all <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> out of Førde, connecting it to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Bergen Airport, Flesland with {{a combined}} seven daily flights. The flights are operated with Dash 8-100 aircraft and are subsidized {{as part of a}} public service obligation contract with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Førde Airport is the local airport for ten municipalities in Sunnfjord and outer Sogn. The airport had 82,356 passengers, 8,109 aircraft movements and 3 tonnes of cargo in 2014. Less than a fifth of the patronage travels to Bergen, and Førde even experiences some leakage by people driving to Bergen Airport directly.|$|E
5|$|A hangar {{was built}} at Bergen Airport in 2003, {{and at the}} same time the airline was {{certified}} as a mechanical aviation workshop. The following year, the Cessna 421 was replaced with a Cessna 441 Conquest II. In 2006, two Beechcraft King Air were bought, and the last Cessna sold. On 20 November 2003, Notodden Airport was closed for all scheduled traffic by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, due to a lack of safety requirements. Bergen Air Transport was forced to reroute all its aircraft to Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. Following an investment of NOK 500,000 from the airline and NOK 1.2 million from the municipality, which owns the airport, <b>scheduled</b> <b>services</b> commenced again. From 1 October 2004, NOK 250,000 was invested at Notodden Airport. Starting in October 2004, the airline also introduced security control of all passengers at Notodden Airport. In 2005, the company had a revenue of NOK 10.3 million; this increased to NOK 20.1 million in 2006, giving a profit of NOK 2.8 million, when the airline transported 2,841 passengers.|$|E
