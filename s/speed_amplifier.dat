The choice of the static converter oriented toward a two-level voltage structure and electromagnetic switches aims at increasing the reliability of the global system and eliminating the multiple inconveniences of the IGBTs.

40|$|Modern {{system design}} {{increasingly}} {{makes use of}} high speed ICs as circuit building blocks. With bandwidths going up and up, demands are placed on the designer for faster and more power efficient circuits. The default high <b>speed</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{has changed over the}} years, with high speed complementary bipolar (CB) process ICs such as the AD 846 and AD 847 in use just about ten years at this writing. During this time, the general utility/availability of these and other ICs have raised the “high speed ” common performance denominator to 50 MHz. The most recent extended frequency complementary bipolar (XFCB) process high speed devices such as the AD 8001 /AD 8002, the AD 9631 / 9632 and the AD 8036 /AD 8037 now extend the operating range into the UHF region.

40|$|The use of {{distributed}} {{optical fibre}} smart sensors {{for the detection}} of acoustic signals in the Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) of robust aerospace vehicles has been demonstrated. Current distributed optical fibre sensors are multiplexed along a single fibre. Inherent problems exist with a multiplexed architecture. Two significant issues are; the possibility of fibre breakage, and the possibility of failure of the single transmitter, the single receiver, or the single processor. In a ‘smart’ architecture, the intelligence, as well as the sensors, is distributed. Hence, if destructive damage occurs, then the SHM system can continue to operate in all other locations on the vehicle, making the system robust. Work on the optical fibre sensors was limited to acoustic signals. This included acoustic emissions, acousto-ultrasonics, acoustic transmissions and other dynamic strain signals. Fibre Bragg Gratings (FBGs) were chosen as the optical fibre sensor {{for the detection of}} the acoustic signals. FBGs offer significant advantages over other types of optical fibre sensors. The most significant of these is the ease of multiplexing and their versatility, i. e. the ability of FBGs to detect a significant number of measurands. In the work on optical fibre sensing, we showed the implementation of an innovative detection system. This Transmit Reflect Detection System (TRDS) made use of both the transmitted and reflected signals from the FBG. The TRDS is an improvement on conventional power detection where either the transmitted or reflected component is used. The TRDS was used to successfully detect all types of dynamic and static signals, the most significant being the acoustic emission from a lead pencil break test. The use of the FBG sensor as a receiver for acoustic communications was also shown. Acoustic communications have been proposed for use in the SHM of robust aerospace vehicles with the use of autonomous agents, e. g. inspection or repair robots. The FBG receivers were compared with PZT receivers. When communicating through aluminium, the FBG performance was not as good as the PZT receiver, specifically due to the properties of the FBG which limit the frequency response. However, in Carbon Fibre Composites (CFC), the FBG outperformed the PZT due to the properties of the CFC. We also note that when contained within the thermal packaging the FBG had a very interesting frequency response, likely due to the suspended beam nature of the structure. This type of packaging could be used to tune the response of the FBG sensor. The work on the distributed optical fibre smart sensors showed the implementation of a Smart Transducer Interface Module (STIM), which used the TRDS with a Digital Signal Processor (DSP). The output of the TRDS was differentially amplified with a high <b>speed</b> <b>amplifier,</b> and the output was passed to the ADC onboard the DSP. The DSP was also used to toggle on and off output, including closed loop actuation, and controlling a 1550 nm laser, which would represent the source used in the implemented system.

30|$|Of all the {{thousands}} of minerals as jewelry, only a few are suitable for electronic devices. Silicon, in more than 95 % of all electronic devices, GaAs-based III-V semiconductors, {{in the rest of}} the optical and optoelectronic devices, and less than 1 % used in all the rest such as lasers, capacitors, transducers, magnetic disks, and switching devices in DVD and CD disks, comprise a very limited lists of elements. For this reason, Esaki and Tsu [1, 2] introduced the concept of man-made superlattices to enrich the list of semiconductors useful for electronic devices. In essence, superlattice is nothing more than a way to assemble two different materials stacked into a periodic array for the purpose of mimicking a continuum similar to the assemble of atoms and molecules into solids by nature. Although it was a very important idea, the technical world simply would not support such activity without showing some unique features [3]. We found it in the NDC, negative differential conductance, the foundation of a high <b>speed</b> <b>amplifier.</b> In retrospect, man-made superlattice offers far more as well as branching off into areas such as soft X-ray mirror [4], IR lasers [5], as well as oscillators and detectors in THz frequencies [6]. The very reason why such venture took off is because the availability of new tools such as the molecular beam epitaxy, MBE, with in situ RHEED, better diagnostic tools such as luminescence and Raman scattering, the all important TEM and SEM, etc. After the introduction of scanning tunneling microscopy, STM; and atomic force microscopy, AFM, stage is set for further extension of quantum wells, QWs, into three-dimensional structures, the quantum dots, QDs. The demand of nanometer regime is due to the requirement of phase coherency: the electrons must be able to preserve its phase coherency at least in a single period, on reaching the Brillouin zone in k-space. However, we shall see why new problems developed in reaching the nanometer regime. First of all, when the wave function is comparable to the size, approximately few nanometers in length, it is very similar to a variety of defects. Strong coupling to those defects results in random noise, the telegraph switching [7]. Thus we are facing great problems in pushing nanodevices. However, some of the new frontiers in these nanostructures are truly worthy of great efforts. For example, chemistry deals with molecules largely governed by the symmetry relationship within a molecule. In solids the symmetry is governed by the translational symmetry of unit cells. Now, with boundaries and shape to contend with, we are dealing with a new kind of chemistry, involving the symmetry of surfaces and boundaries as well as shapes. For example, we know that it is unlikely a tetrahedral-shaped QD may be constructed with individual linear molecules. Catalysis is still a matter of mystery even today. Now we are talking about adding boundaries and shape for nanochemistry. The possibility of crossing over to include biological research of nanostructures is even more spectacular, which will ultimately lead mankind into the physics of living things.|$|E

The performance of these filters is typically limited by the inductors which are large, expensive and far from ideal in an electrical sense. By using amplifiers and feedback, the same filter characteristics can be achieved {{without the use of}} inductors, these filters are known as “active filters”. An active filter will perform well {{only to the extent that}} the amplifiers in it behave in an ideal sense, so traditionally active filters have been limited to applications at frequencies below 1 MHz. With the advent of low cost, very high <b>speed</b> operational <b>amplifiers,</b> it is now feasible to realize active filters with frequency ranges in the tens of MHz. With some of the newer high <b>speed</b> <b>amplifiers</b> such as the CLC 449 – a 1. 2 GHz bandwidth amplifier, filters with corner frequencies above 100 MHz have been built. This application note will provide a recipe to realize active filters using low cost, high <b>speed</b> operational <b>amplifiers.</b> The filter topology that is used is the Sallen-Key Filter which uses the operational amplifier as a fixed gain block.

40|$|Gas sensing {{is a key}} {{technology}} with applications in various industrial, medical and environmental areas. Optical detection mechanisms allow for a highly selective, contactless and fast detection. For this purpose, rotational-vibrational absorption bands within the mid infrared (MIR) spectral region are exploited and probed with appropriate light sources. During the past years, the development of novel laser concepts such as interband cascade lasers (ICLs) and quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) has driven a continuous optimization of MIR laser sources. On the other hand side, there has been relatively little progress on detectors in this wavelength range. Here, we study two novel and promising GaSb-based detector concepts: Interband cascade detectors (ICD) and resonant tunneling diode (RTD) photodetectors. ICDs are a promising approach towards highly sensitive room temperature detection of MIR radiation. They {{make use of the}} cascading scheme that is enabled by the broken gap alignment of the two binaries GaSb and InAs. The interband transition in GaSb/InAs-superlattices (SL) allows for normal incidence detection. The cut-off wavelength, which determines the low energy detection limit, can be engineered via the SL period. RTD photodetectors act as low noise and high <b>speed</b> <b>amplifiers</b> of small optically generated electrical signals. In contrast to avalanche photodiodes, where the gain originates from multiplication due to impact ionization, in RTD photodetectors a large tunneling current is modulated via Coulomb interaction by the presence of photogenerated minority charge carriers.

SUBJECTS [...] Four electrocardiograph leads (I, aVR, V 1, V 5) recorded in eight healthy people relaxing in a semirecumbent position. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Manual measurement of QT interval in 512 electrocardiograms (eight subjects x four leads x eight presentations x two repeats) by each of four cardiologists. RESULTS [...] QT intervals measured were significantly longer with greater amplifier gain: by 8 ms for a doubling of gain (p < 0. 005), equivalent to a doubling of T wave height. QT intervals measured were significantly longer at slower paper speeds: by 11 ms when paper speed was reduced from 100 to 50 mm/s (p < 0. 001) and by 16 ms when speed was further reduced from 50 to 25 mm/s (p < 0. 001). Neither the presence of noise nor the presence of a second QRST complex altered the mean QT measurements. There were consistent differences in the measurements between cardiologists, amounting to a maximum mean difference of 20 ms.
