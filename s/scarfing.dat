60|$|One of the {{attending}} harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable {{hole in the}} lower part of the swaying mass. Into this hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for what follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate, lunging, slicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates <b>scarfing,</b> the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by way of assuaging the general friction.|$|E

He saw that Hurry did not overrate {{the strength of this}} position in a military point of view, since it would not be easy to attack it without exposing the assailants to the fire of the besieged. A good deal of art had also been manifested in the disposition of the timber of which the building was constructed and which afforded a protection much greater than was usual to the ordinary log-cabins of the frontier. The sides and ends were composed of the trunks of large pines, cut about nine feet long, and placed upright, instead of being laid horizontally, as was the practice of the country. These logs were squared on three sides, and had large tenons on each end. Massive sills were secured on the heads of the piles, with suitable grooves dug out of their upper surfaces, which had been squared for the purpose, and the lower tenons of the upright pieces were placed in these grooves, giving them secure fastening below. Plates had been laid on the upper ends of the upright logs, and were kept in their places by a similar contrivance; the several corners of the structure being well fastened by <b>scarfing</b> and pinning the sills and plates. The doors were made of smaller logs, similarly squared, and the roof was composed of light poles, firmly united, and well covered with bark.|$|E

40|$|<b>Scarf</b> joints are an {{effective}} method of bonding thick composite laminates for {{applications such as}} the repair of composite aircraft structures. However, concerns remain about their damage tolerance characteristics. Typically composite <b>scarf</b> repairs to aircraft structures require use of hand tools or rudimentary jigs.

Tensile test specimens were prepared with two different configurations of <b>scarf</b> for representing an undercut or imprecise <b>scarf</b> typical of a machining error.

5000|$|An {{anthropologist}} and {{his family}} take a chimpanzee into their home and make more of a fuss over the animal than readers are likely to in a first novel by science writer Preston (Cities of Gold, 1992). A curator at the Boston Museum of Natural History, Dr. Hugo Archibald goes to Africa to buy chimpanzee skulls and {{falls in love with}} a baby chimp, whom he brings home to his wife, Lea, and their young children, Sandy and Sarah. The Archibalds raise Jennie as a human child, dressing her in diapers and kids clothes and buying her dolls and toys, and Jennie and Sandy become inseparable best friends. A neighbor who is a Christian minister takes it upon himself to bring Jennie to Jesus, and a primate researcher teaches her sign language. But then Jennie hits puberty, her hormones kick in, and, predictably, she becomes uncontrollable; the fate of this chimp who thinks shes human is not a pretty one. Much more insightful when it comes to animals than humans, Preston hasnt worked out the Archibalds motivations, and this omission is a serious flaw of the novel. Preston seems to want readers to think that the Archibalds are merely eccentric when all his evidence points to the fact that these people are disturbed and that Jennie is filling some bizarre need in the family. Preston throws us a few tidbits--an adult Sarah confesses that she had hated Jennie because she believed that her father loved the chimpanzee better; Hugo, discussing with a colleague Jennies care after he and his wife are dead, says that the Jennie problem is no different than having a mentally retarded child--but they only confuse us all the more. It doesnt help matters that the novel, written as an oral history, masquerades as nonfiction. As a novel, this is sometimes sweet but mostly strange. Better to take the kids to the soon-to-be-made Disney movie; Jennies sophomoric monkeyshines--peddling away on her tricycle, <b>scarfing</b> bananas, and giving all and sundry ``the finger--may play better on the silver screen than they do on the written page.|$|E
40|$|The <b>scarfing</b> {{processing}} {{experiment was}} carried out for a steel slab moving at a constant speed with the <b>scarfing</b> torch fixed. The temperature histories inside the slab were recorded by two sets of thermocouples in different depths. A two-step computational model of heat transfer in <b>scarfing</b> processing has been developed in FLUENT. The model features in detail heat conduction from both the hot slag coating and the <b>scarfing</b> reaction to the steel slab surface, and it solves for steady state heat advection in the Step- 1 model followed by the Step- 2 model of transient heat transfer calculation. The combination of these two steps is able to give the complete prediction of a temperature history of 122. 2 sec. The temperature predictions agree well with the experimental measurements. The high temperature region (1100 oC ~ 1500 oC) {{is found to be}} mainly located in a depth of 0. 5 mm near the slab surface. The fraction of heat conducted from the hot slag coating into the slab is 5. 4 % while that from the <b>scarfing</b> reaction is 10. 3 %. The simulations clearly explain the measurements and suggest practical implications. Section II. Background <b>Scarfing</b> processing has been used widely to remove surface defects from steel and other semi-finished as-cast products for over 70 years. The first automated <b>scarfing</b> machine used in production was built and installed in 1935. Steel slabs produced from continuous casting often exhibit surface defects, including inclusions, pits and cracks, such as shown in Fig. 1. In order to obtain advanced high strength steels (AHSS) for automotive parts or other high-quality-products, these surface defects should be avoided during the casting process or removed during post-processing using the <b>scarfing</b> technique...|$|E
