40|$|New Zealand’s (NZ) {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) profile is unique amongst developed countries as almost 50 % of GHG emissions {{are derived from}} agriculture. In contrast, agricultural sectors of other developed countries typically contribute < 10 % to the national total GHG profile. In NZ, agricultural GHG emissions are dominated by methane (CH 4) from enteric fermentation and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from excreta deposition and nitrogen (N) fertiliser application. Nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural soils are largely affected by N inputs and soil moisture conditions, and contribute 33 % of agricultural GHG emissions. In pastoral hill country these factors are inherently more variable than in flat land pastures due to topographydriven differences in excretal N returns and in soil moisture. This limits the application of N 2 O emission data collected from trials conducted on flat land to hill country situations. The objective of this thesis {{was to determine the}} influence of topography and fertiliser N inputs to soil on N 2 O emissions in hill country. Small scale trials were conducted to measure these aspects of N cycling. Three trials were conducted to measure the effect of slope and fertiliser N input on nitrification potential (NP) and N 2 O emissions. The results of these short term trials suggested that <b>slope</b> <b>class</b> and fertiliser N rates significantly affected nitrification rates and N 2 O emissions in hill country due to differences in N inputs and moisture status, as affected by slope. Both NP and N 2 O emissions were highly spatially variable during the measurement periods and the results presented in this thesis suggest that the majority of N 2 O emissions in sheep grazed hill country are produced from low slope/stock camping areas. Based on our findings it is recommended that mitigation options {{to reduce the risk of}} N loss from sheep grazed hill country should be targeted at low slope/stock campsite areas. Due to the significant relationship between <b>slope</b> <b>class</b> and N 2 O emissions, <b>slope</b> <b>class</b> may be a suitable parameter for up-scaling estimates of N 2 O emissions from sheep grazed hill country...|$|E

This not only reduces the areas of productive land but also acts as a pollutant to rivers, lakes and other water systems.

The LiDAR data sampling densities is about 2. 2 points per m 2. The study area is covered by rubber trees with moderately dense understorey vegetation and mixed forest.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 2011 to estimate soil and nutrient losses caused by water erosion and predict nutrient replacement costs on different land use types and <b>slope</b> <b>classes</b> at Harfetay watershed, Northwestern Ethiopia. The revised soil loss equation (RUSLE) was used to estimate the soil loss from the different land uses and <b>slope</b> <b>classes</b> in watershed. Moreover, nutrient loss from similar units was calculated by multiplying the in situ nutrient concentration of soil samples by the estimated soil loss using RUSLE. The replacement costs of nutrient losses were calculated by multiplying the nutrient loss with the price of available nutrients in urea and diammonium phosphate. The estimate of the RUSLE indicated that the average soil losses in the study watershed were 119 tons ha - 1 year - 1 for non-conserved crop land, 23 tons for conserved farmlands, 23 tons for forest and shrub lands, 19 tons for grazing lands, and 6 tons for plantation forest. The mean soil loss for lower <b>slope</b> <b>classes</b> (30 %) were 30. 11, 48. 09 and 57. 22 tons ha - 1 year - 1, respectively. The highest losses of total nitrogen (154. 7 kg ha - 1 year - 1), available phosphorus (1. 84 kg ha - 1 year - 1), and organic matter (1677. 9 kg ha - 1 year - 1) were obtained from non-conserved cropland. Conversely, the lowest values of the same parameters were registered from the land covered with plantation forest. Comparing <b>slope</b> <b>classes</b> for non conserved cropland, organic matter and nutrient losses were higher in upper <b>slope</b> <b>classes</b> followed by middle and lower ones. The replacement cost of available N and available P for non-conserved cropland, conserved cropland, forest/shrub lands, grazing lands and plantations were 121. 22, 36. 41, 27. 09, 32. 22 and 13. 10 Birr ha - 1 year - 1, respectively (1 USD = 19 Birr); and the weighted mean replacement cost in the watershed was estimated to be 98. 1 Birr ha - 1 year - 1 which is about 20 % of the cost of fertilizer applied per individual farmers in the watershed. From the study it was possible to conclude that conversion of forest lands and plantation forests to cropland causes serious soil and nutrient losses. Construction of conservation structures on cropland, however, will reduce soil and nutrient losses. To halt soil and nutrient loss and ensure sustainable land management and agricultural development in the Harfetay watershed and similar watersheds, policy and development interventions including increasing awareness of farmers on of soil and nutrient losses, enforcing land use policies and expanding bio-physical soil conservation practices are required. </p...|$|R
