5|$|By mid-1974, Australia {{was in an}} {{economic}} slump, suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and 1973–75 recession. The 1973 oil crisis had caused prices to spike and, according to government figures, inflation topped 13percent {{for over a year}} between 1973 and 1974. Part of the inflation was due to Whitlam's desire to increase wages and conditions of the Commonwealth Public Service as a pacesetter for the private sector. The Whitlam government had cut tariffs by 25percent in 1973; 1974 saw an increase in imports of 30percent and a $1.5billion increase in the trade deficit. Primary producers of commodities such as beef were caught in a credit squeeze as <b>short-term</b> <b>rates</b> rose to extremely high levels. Unemployment also rose significantly. Unease within the ALP led to Barnard's defeat when Jim Cairns challenged him for his deputy leadership. Whitlam gave little help to his embattled deputy, who had formed {{the other half of the}} duumvirate.|$|E

2500|$|Under unusual circumstances, {{long-term}} {{investors will}} settle for lower yields now {{if they think}} the economy will slow or even decline in the future. Campbell R. Harvey's 1986 dissertation showed that an inverted yield curve accurately forecasts U.S. recessions. An inverted curve has indicated a worsening economic situation in the future 7 times since 1970. The New York Federal Reserve regards it as a valuable forecasting tool in predicting recessions two to six quarters ahead. In addition to potentially signaling an economic decline, inverted yield curves also imply that the market believes inflation will remain low. This is because, {{even if there is}} a recession, a low bond yield will still be offset by low inflation. However, technical factors, such as a flight to quality or global economic or currency situations, may cause an increase in demand for bonds on the long end of the yield curve, causing long-term rates to fall.

40|$|M. Com. (Financial Economics) Recently, {{there has}} been a growth in the bond market. This growth has brought with it an {{ever-increasing}} volume and range of interest rate depended derivative products known as interest rate derivatives. Amongst the variables used in pricing these derivative products is the <b>short-term</b> interest <b>rate.</b> A numbers of <b>short-term</b> interest <b>rate</b> models that are used to fit the <b>short-term</b> interest <b>rate</b> exist. Therefore, understanding the features characterised by various <b>short-term</b> interest <b>rate</b> models, and determining the best fitting models is crucial as this variable is fundamental in pricing interest rate derivatives, which further determine the decision making of economic agents. This dissertation examines various <b>short-term</b> interest <b>rate</b> models in continuous time in order to determine which model best fits the South African <b>short-term</b> interest <b>rates.</b> Both the linear and nonlinear <b>short-term</b> interest <b>rate</b> models were estimated.

40|$|In {{an economy}} where cash {{can be stored}} costlessly (in nominal terms), the nominal {{interest}} rate is bounded below by zero. This paper derives {{the implications of this}} nonnegativity constraint for the term structure and shows that it induces a nonlinear and convex relation between short- and long-term interest rates. As a result, the long-term rate responds asymmetrically to changes in the <b>short-term</b> <b>rate,</b> and by less than predicted by a benchmark linear model. In particular, a decrease in the <b>short-term</b> <b>rate</b> leads to a decrease in the long-term rate that is smaller in magnitude than the increase in the long-term rate associated with an increase in the <b>short-term</b> <b>rate</b> of the same size. Up to the extent that monetary policy acts by affecting long-term rates through the term structure, its power is considerably reduced at low interest rates.
