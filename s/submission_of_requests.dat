40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an evaluation of}} the Scottish freedom of information regime in the modern denationalised environment.

A compliance matrix, with several response measures, recorded the progression and outcome <b>of</b> the <b>requests</b> sent to each named ‘public authority’. The article is also furnished with a contextual overview of the interaction between the home nation FOI regimes and private enterprise with a nod to contemporaneous events. In turn, the paper reveals several quagmires for the operational practicality of FOI in the privatised arena: a pronounced reminder of the difficulties associated with maintaining a functioning and practical FOI regime in light of a myriad of public service delivery models in the denationalised epoch...|$|R
