5|$|On Midsummer 1953 Gardner invited Valiente {{again to}} Woodford-Grimes's house, {{and it was}} here that he {{initiated}} her into Wicca in a ritual during which they <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> an altar and he read from his Book of Shadows. The three of them then set off to the prehistoric monument of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, where they witnessed the Druids performing a ritual there. Gardner had lent a ritual sword which he owned to the Druids, who placed it within the monument's Heel Stone during their rite. Valiente told her husband and mother about the visit to Stonehenge, but not about her initiation, of which, she feared, they would not have approved.|$|E

She <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> us, seemingly slight, graceful of carriage, and exquisitely beautiful even to critical eyes. Then, still standing, she faced her class as one who knew herself {{to be a teacher}} by divine right. She turned to the student {{at the end of the}} first row of seats and took direct mental cognizance of this one, plainly knocked at the door of this individual consciousness.... This continued until each member of the class had received the same mental cognizance. No audible word voiced the purely mental contact.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} fifteen days the fleet slowly {{followed}} the coastline west, and then south. The casks brought from Cuba were leaking and the expedition was now running dangerously low on fresh water; {{the hunt for}} more became an overriding priority as the expedition advanced, and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull close to the shore due to the shallows. On 23 February 1517, the day of Saint Lazarus, another city was spotted and named San Lázaro by the Spanish – it is now known by its original Maya name, Campeche. A large contingent put ashore in the brigantine and the ships' boats to fill their water casks in a freshwater pool. They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being loaded into the boats; they questioned the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs. The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city. They were led amongst large buildings until they <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> a blood-caked altar, {{where many of the}} city's inhabitants crowded around. The Indians piled reeds before the visitors; this act was followed by a procession of armed Maya warriors in full war paint, followed by ten Maya priests. The Maya set fire to the reeds and indicated that the Spanish would be killed if they were not gone by the time the reeds had been consumed. The Spanish party withdrew in defensive formation to the shore and rapidly boarded their boats to retreat to the safety of the ships.|$|E

25|$|In 1835, Tocqueville made {{a journey}} through Ireland. His {{observations}} provide {{one of the best}} pictures of how Ireland <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> the Great Famine (1845–49). The observations chronicle the growing Catholic middle-class and the appalling conditions in which most Catholic tenant farmers lived. Tocqueville made clear both his libertarian sympathies and his affinity for his Irish co-religionists.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{euphoria}} of the victory was short-lived, as rumors began to swirl that Ohno and Smith, both good friends of Davis's, intentionally threw the race so that Davis would win.

25|$|A special {{letter for}} a variant {{realization}} of the short /e/ sound, , was briefly used in the Boeotian city of Thespiae in the late 5th century BC. It occurred {{in the place of}} normal epsilon (Ε) whenever the sound <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> another vowel. Since its shape suggests a compromise form between an Ε and an Ι, it is thought that it denoted a raised allophone, approaching /i/. It is attested in only one document, a set of grave stelae from 424 BC.|$|E

25|$|Occupied Armenia was reconstructed on Roman terms. In 164, a new capital, Kaine Polis ('New City'), {{replaced}} Artaxata. A {{new king}} was installed: a Roman senator of consular rank and Arsacid descent, C. Iulius Sohaemus. He {{may not even}} have been crowned in Armenia; the ceremony may {{have taken place in}} Antioch, or even Ephesus. Sohaemus was hailed on the imperial coinage of 164 under the legend : Lucius sat on a throne with his staff while Sohamenus <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> him, saluting the emperor.|$|E
25|$|The {{group of}} ecclesiastical remains at Ardfert {{is one of}} the most {{interesting}} and instructive now existing in Ireland. The ruins of the ancient Cathedral of St Brendan, and of its annexed chantries and detached chapels, form a very complete reliquary of Irish ecclesiastical architecture, in its various orders and ages, from the plain but solid Danhliag of the seventh or eighth century to some late and most ornate examples of medieval Gothic. The cathedral, as it now stands, or rather as it <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> it was finally dismantled in A.D. 1641.|$|E

25|$|In the parashah, Moses {{told the}} Israelites {{that all the}} people <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> God {{to enter into the}} covenant, {{violation}} of which would bring on curses, but if they returned to God and heeded God’s commandments, then God would take them back in love and bring them together again from the ends of the world.

25|$|She {{described}} the Temple of Seti as like entering a time machine, where the past becomes {{the present and}} the modern mind has difficulty understanding a world in which magic is accepted. She claimed that the scenes depicted on the temple walls were active in the minds of ancient Egyptians on two levels. Firstly, they made the actions displayed permanent. The painting of Pharaoh offering bread to Osiris, for example, continued his actions so long as the depiction remained. Secondly, the image could be animated by the spirit of the god, if the person <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> the depiction and called on the god's name.|$|E
25|$|A good {{description}} of the House as it <b>stood</b> <b>before</b> the siege {{is found in the}} Marquis's own Diary. Basing House stood on a rising ground, its form circular, encompassed with brick ramparts lined with earth, and a very deep ditch but dry. The lofty Gate-house, with four Turrets, looking Northwards, on the right hand thereof, without the ditch, a goodly building containing two fair courts; before them was the Grange, severed by a wall and common road, etc. Some idea of the magnitude of the place may be founds when it is remembered that from a survey made in 1798 the area of the works including gardens and entrenchments, covered about fourteen and a half acres.|$|E

However, his patriotic harangue aroused them to cheers, and the first few 50-man helicopter loads of troops loaded for deployment and left. The general left on his helicopter to meet the airlifted troops at Bouamlong. The weather turned bad, grounding further helilifts. Half of GM 31 deserted; more than that abandoned GM 33. With half the troops gone, the off and on mutineers were disarmed and flown to the training base at Seno.|$|E
