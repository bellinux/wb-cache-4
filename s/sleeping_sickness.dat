5|$|Despite these atrocities, {{the main}} cause of the {{population}} decline was disease. A number of pandemics, notably African <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> smallpox, swine influenza and amoebic dysentery, ravaged indigenous populations. In 1901 alone it was estimated that half-a-million Congolese had died from <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b> Disease, famine and violence combined to reduce the birth-rate while excess deaths rose.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, some {{amino acids}} {{derivatives}} {{are used in}} pharmaceutical industry. They include 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) used for experimental treatment of depression, L-DOPA (L-dihydroxyphenylalanine) for Parkinson's treatment, and eflornithine drug that inhibits ornithine decarboxylase and used {{in the treatment of}} <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Atangana lobbied in {{his later}} life for public health causes, such as the {{eradication}} of <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b> He never supported the expansion of Cameroun's public school system, since he believed that educated subjects might one day challenge his rule. Atangana's health began to fail him beginning in August 1943. On 1 September, he died in Mvolyé, Yaoundé.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, the {{government}} increased restrictions on private travel and immigrants, which meant anybody arriving in Mongalla and wishing to go north from the Uganda or the Belgian Congo could be examined for <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> by a medical officer. The maximum punishment for any {{breach of the}} new regulations was a £10 fine or a 6-month prison sentence.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} animals. Pathogenic bacteria cause diseases such as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax. Protozoa cause diseases including malaria, <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> dysentery and toxoplasmosis. Microscopic fungi cause diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis and histoplasmosis. Pathogenic viruses cause diseases such as influenza, yellow fever and AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases. The organisms involved include pathogenic bacteria, causing {{diseases such}} as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax; protozoa, causing {{diseases such as}} malaria, <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> dysentery and toxoplasmosis; and also fungi causing diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis or histoplasmosis. However, other diseases such as influenza, yellow fever or AIDS are caused by pathogenic viruses, which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, microorganisms by the strict definition. No clear examples of archaean pathogens are known, although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human periodontal disease.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} {{at birth}} {{is estimated to}} be 54.71 years in 2012, among the lowest in the world. Endemic diseases include dengue fever, filariasis, leishmaniasis, malaria, meningitis, schistosomiasis, and <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b> The HIV/AIDS seroprevalence rate is estimated at 5.4% for those aged 15–49, although a strong stigma against the illness keeps the number of reported cases artificially low. Breast ironing, a traditional practice that is prevalent in Cameroon, may affect girls' health. Female genital mutilation (FGM), while not widespread, is practiced among some populations; according to a 2013 UNICEF report, 1% of women in Cameroon have undergone FGM. Traditional healers remain a popular alternative to evidence-based medicine.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{inhibition}} is {{an unusual}} type of irreversible inhibition where the enzyme converts the inhibitor into a reactive form in its active site. An example is the inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, α-difluoromethylornithine or DFMO, which is an analogue of the amino acid ornithine, and is used to treat African trypanosomiasis (<b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness).</b> Ornithine decarboxylase can catalyse the decarboxylation of DFMO instead of ornithine, as shown above. However, this decarboxylation reaction {{is followed by the}} elimination of a fluorine atom, which converts this catalytic intermediate into a conjugated imine, a highly electrophilic species. This reactive form of DFMO then reacts with either a cysteine or lysine residue in the active site to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Tropical disease {{killed or}} {{rendered}} ineffective far more 2RR men than the Germans did; {{at times the}} regiment was reduced to an effective strength of under 100 by the vast myriad of potential ailments, including trench fever, blackwater fever, dysentery, pneumonia, <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> and many others. The 1,038 personnel who served with 2RR in East Africa collectively went into hospital 2,272 times, and there were 10,626 incidences of illness—in other words, the average 2RR soldier was hospitalised twice and reported sick 10 times. In January 1917, only 91 of the regiment's men were considered fit for duty; {{it was no longer}} an effective fighting force, and the white Southern Rhodesian manpower did not exist to continue reinforcing it. It was therefore withdrawn from East Africa that month. Those men who were healthy enough to return home arrived back in Salisbury on 14 April 1917, receiving a tumultuous welcome, but the majority of 2RR remained in medical care overseas for some time afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Hector Duff {{wrote of}} how spotted hyenas in the Mzimba {{district}} of Angoniland would wait at dawn outside people's huts and attack {{them when they}} opened their doors. In 1908–09 in Uganda, spotted hyenas regularly killed sufferers of African <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> as they slept outside in camps. Spotted hyenas are widely feared in Malawi, {{where they have been}} known to occasionally attack people at night, particularly during the hot season when people sleep outside. Hyena attacks were widely reported in Malawi's Phalombe plain, to the north of Michesi Mountain. Five deaths were recorded in 1956, five in 1957 and six in 1958. This pattern continued until 1961 when eight people were killed. During the 1960s, Flying Doctors received over two dozen cases of hyena attacks on humans in Kenya. An anecdotal 2004 news report from the World Wide Fund for Nature indicates that 35 people were killed by spotted hyenas during a 12-month period in Mozambique along a 20km stretch of road near the Tanzanian border.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is preyed on by lions, leopards, African {{wild dogs}} and hyenas and predation {{is the main}} cause of death. They are also prone to outbreaks of disease which may also lead to a decline in numbers. Major human-related factors affecting populations include large-scale deforestation, the drying up of water sources, the expansion of settlements and poaching. Diseases of domestic cattle such as <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> can be transmitted to the animals and take their toll. The erection of fences that interrupt traditional migratory routes between wet and dry-season ranges have resulted in mass death events when the animals become cut off from water sources and the areas of better grazing they are seeking during droughts. A study of the factors influencing wildebeest populations in the Maasai Mara ecosystem revealed that the populations had undergone a drastic decline of around 80% from about 119,000 individuals in 1977 to around 22,000 twenty years later. The major cause of this was thought to be the expansion of agriculture, which led to the loss of wet season grazing and the traditional calving and breeding ranges. Similarly, drastic declines have recently occurred in the Tarangire wildebeest migration.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} {{has been}} present in Africa {{for thousands of}} years. Because {{of a lack of}} travel between indigenous people, <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> in humans had been limited to isolated pockets. This changed once Arab slave traders entered central Africa from the east, following the Congo River, bringing parasites along. Gambian <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> travelled up the Congo River, then further eastwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{course of}} the disease in animals {{is similar to the}} course of <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> in humans.|$|E
25|$|He {{lived on}} at St Louis de Murumbi until 1910, {{when it was}} {{abandoned}} due to <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tryptophol is a {{chemical}} compound that induces sleep in humans. It {{is produced by}} the trypanosomal parasite in <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> previous names have included negro lethargy, maladie du sommeil (Fr), Schlafkrankheit (Gr), African lethargy, and Congo trypanosomiasis.|$|E
25|$|The related drug Melarsoprol {{is still}} in use against late-state African trypanosomiasis (<b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness),</b> despite its high {{toxicity}} and possibly fatal side effects.|$|E
25|$|Horse-flies (Tabanidae) {{and stable}} flies (Muscidae) {{possibly}} {{play a role}} in transmission of nagana (the animal form of <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness)</b> and the human disease form.|$|E
25|$|Joubert {{lived on}} at St Louis de Murumbi until 1910, {{when it was}} {{abandoned}} due to <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b> He died at Moba on 27 May 1927.|$|E
25|$|Seven weeks {{past his}} 71st birthday, Alfred Milner died at Great Wigsell, East Sussex, of <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> soon after {{returning}} from South Africa. His viscountcy, lacking heirs, died with him.|$|E
25|$|G.D. Hale Carpenter {{joined the}} London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, {{and took the}} Doctor of Medicine {{examination}} in 1913 with a dissertation on the tsetse fly (Glossina palpalis) and <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b>|$|E
25|$|A sleep {{disorder}}, or somnipathy, is {{a medical}} disorder of the sleep patterns of a person or animal. Polysomnography is a test commonly used for diagnosing some sleep disorders. Sleep disorders are broadly classified into dyssomnias, parasomnias, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and other disorders including ones caused by medical or psychological conditions and <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b> Some common sleep disorders include insomnia (chronic inability to sleep), sleep apnea (abnormally low breathing during sleep), narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness at inappropriate times), cataplexy (sudden and transient loss of muscle tone), and <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> (disruption of sleep cycle due to infection). Other disorders that are being studied include sleepwalking, sleep terror and bed wetting.|$|E
25|$|For current funding statistics, human African trypanosomiasis is grouped with kinetoplastid infections. Kinetoplastids {{refer to}} a group of {{flagellate}} protozoa. Kinetoplastid infections include African <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> Chagas' disease, and Leishmaniasis. All together, these three diseases accounted for 4.4 million disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and an additional 70,075 recorded deaths yearly. For kinetoplastid infections, the total global research and development funding was approximately $136.3 million in 2012. Each of the three diseases, African <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> Chagas' disease, and Leishmaniasis each received approximately a third of the funding, which was about $36.8 million US dollars, $38.7 million US dollars, and $31.7 million US dollars, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Among {{protozoan}} endoparasites, {{such as the}} malarial parasites in {{the genus}} Plasmodium and <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> parasites in the genus Trypanosoma, infective stages in the host's blood are transported to new hosts by biting blood-drinking (hematophagous) insects acting as vectors.|$|E
25|$|Human African trypanosomiasis, {{also called}} <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> {{is caused by}} trypanosomes of the species Trypanosoma brucei. This disease is {{invariably}} fatal unless treated but can almost always be cured with current medicines, if the disease is diagnosed early enough.|$|E
25|$|Tsetse flies {{transmit}} {{a similar}} disease to humans, called African trypanosomiasis - human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b> An estimated 70 {{million people in}} 20 countries are {{at different levels of}} risk and only 3-4 million people are covered by active surveillance. The DALY index (disability-adjusted life years), an indicator to quantify the burden of disease, includes the impact of both the duration of life lost due to premature death and the duration of life lived with a disability. The annual burden of <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> is estimated at 2 million DALYs. Since the disease tends to affect economically active adults, the total cost to a family with a patient is about 25% of a year’s income.|$|E
25|$|Late-stage {{neurological}} trypanosomiasis, or <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> is {{a condition}} in which trypanosoma protozoa are found in brain tissue. It is not yet known how the parasites infect the brain from the blood, but it is suspected that they cross through the choroid plexus, a circumventricular organ.|$|E
25|$|For <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> {{funding was}} split into basic research, drug discovery, vaccines, and diagnostics. The {{greatest}} amount of funding was directed towards basic research of the disease; approximately $21.6 million US dollars were directed towards that effort. As for therapeutic development, approximately $10.9 billion were invested.|$|E
25|$|The {{conquest of}} <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> and nagana {{would be of}} immense benefit to rural {{development}} and contribute to poverty alleviation and improved food security in sub-Saharan Africa. Human African trypanosomosis (HAT) and animal African trypanosomosis (AAT) are sufficiently important to make virtually any intervention against these diseases beneficial.|$|E
25|$|African germs took {{numerous}} European {{lives and}} deterred permanent settlements. Diseases such as yellow fever, <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> yaws, and leprosy made Africa a very inhospitable place for Europeans. The deadliest disease was malaria, endemic throughout Tropical Africa. In 1854, {{the discovery of}} quinine and other medical innovations helped to make conquest and colonization in Africa possible.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010 {{it caused}} around 9,000 deaths, down from 34,000 in 1990. As of 2000, the disability-adjusted life-years (9 to 10 years) lost due to <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> are 2.0 million. Over 60 million {{people living in}} some 250 {{locations}} {{are at risk of}} contracting the disease, and under 10,000 new cases were reported in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Smallpox {{epidemics}} and <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> also {{devastated the}} disrupted population. By 1896, African trypanosomiasis had killed up to 5,000 Africans {{in the village}} of Lukolela on the Congo River. The mortality statistics were collected through the efforts of British consul Roger Casement, who found, for example, only 600 survivors of the disease in Lukolela in 1903.|$|E
25|$|Regular active surveillance, {{involving}} {{detection and}} prompt treatment of new infections, and tsetse fly control is {{the backbone of}} the strategy used to control <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness.</b> Systematic screening of at-risk communities is the best approach, because case-by-case screening is not practical in endemic regions. Systematic screening may be in the form of mobile clinics or fixed screening centres where teams travel daily to areas of high infection rates. Such screening efforts are important because early symptoms are not evident or serious enough to warrant patients with gambiense disease to seek medical attention, particularly in very remote areas. Also, diagnosis of the disease is difficult and health workers may not associate such general symptoms with trypanosomiasis. Systematic screening allows early-stage disease to be detected and treated before the disease progresses, and removes the potential human reservoir. A single case of sexual transmission of West African <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> has been reported.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sleeping</b> <b>sickness</b> {{begins with}} a tsetse bite leading to an {{inoculation}} in the subcutaneous tissue. The infection moves into the lymphatic system, leading to a characteristic swelling of the lymph glands called Winterbottom's sign. The infection progresses into the blood stream and eventually crosses into {{the central nervous system}} and invades the brain leading to extreme lethargy and eventually to death.|$|E
25|$|African trypanosomiasis, {{also known}} as <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness,</b> is an insect-borne {{parasitic}} disease of humans and other animals. It is caused by protozoa of the species Trypanosoma brucei. There are two types that infect humans, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (TbG) and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (TbR). TbG causes over 98% of reported cases. Both are usually transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly and are most common in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|Bites from tsetse flies are painful {{but these}} flies are not {{generally}} associated with direct causes of lost production in cattle. Glossina morsitans and G.pallidipes tsetse-flies are transmitters of various species of Trypanosoma protozoa causing animal trypanosomiasis (= nagana) in cattle, {{and other forms}} of trypanosomiasis in sheep, goats, pigs, camels and horses. Tsetse-flies are also notorious as transmitters of the Trypanosoma species causing African trypanosomiasis (= <b>sleeping</b> <b>sickness)</b> in humans.|$|E
