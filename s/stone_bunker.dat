50|$|Few of the {{original}} buildings survive. The most striking are three sets of stone structures that mark former gates to the fort. On the Waikiki side, there {{is a pair of}} gateposts {{on either side of the}} sidewalk and a square <b>stone</b> <b>bunker</b> across the street with a gun slit in the outside wall and with crenels and merlons along the top, as if it were a battlement in a European castle. On the Kahala side is a larger stone gatehouse with rounded edges of the kind popular in the 1930s. Between them, on the Kaimuki side, is a purely decorative structure, a circular stonewalled planter with two jagged stone arches intersecting at 90-degree angles. It now stands at the edge of the Kapiolani Community College parking lot, but was once flanked by two large gun barrels.|$|E
50|$|While Taliban {{forces were}} able to launch bold attacks against US forces, {{they were unable to}} {{maintain}} their momentum. Coalition forces inflicted heavy casualties upon the Taliban, including several local leaders. Coalition forces also {{were able to}} locate several <b>stone</b> <b>bunkers</b> on the Abas Ghar, as well as firing positions used in attacks against the Korangal Outpost. Taliban activity in the Korengal valley dropped significantly in the months following the operation.|$|R

5000|$|During World War II, the German occupying {{military}} forces built a coastal fort on Helg√∏ya. Work began in 1942 and included Russian {{prisoners of war}} in the work. The purpose of the facility was to protect coastal traffic and the west entrance to Kristiansand. The fort was originally called [...] "Norway's little Gibraltar." [...] The fort had a workforce of 150. It was armed with four 10.5 cm coastal artillery guns had a range of approximately 12 km. To protect the fort, there were machine guns, mortars, and flame throwers. Furthermore, the fort was equipped with radar, searchlights, and smoke systems. All together there were 31 buildings there along with 26 bulletproof <b>stone</b> <b>bunkers</b> in the area. The fort was abandoned in 1945 and many of the buildings were demolished and equipment and facilities were removed in an attempt to erase its memory over the following 30-40 years. In 1987, however, restoration work was begun. Several of the 10.5 cm M/13 Schneider guns are back in place. Fortification, trenches, roads, and tunnels in the area is secured and repaired, so the area is easily accessible.|$|R

5000|$|In 1825, {{after an}} {{exhaustive}} search throughout New England, Solomon Willard selected the Quincy site {{as the source}} of <b>stone</b> for the <b>Bunker</b> Hill Monument in Charlestown.

2500|$|In 1825, {{after an}} {{exhaustive}} search throughout New England, Solomon Willard selected the Quincy site {{as the source}} of <b>stone</b> for the <b>Bunker</b> Hill Monument. After many delays and much obstruction, the railway itself was granted a charter on March 4, 1826, with right of eminent domain to establish its right-of-way. [...] Businessman and state legislator Thomas Handasyd Perkins organized the financing of the new Granite Railway Company, owning a majority of its shares, and he was designated its president. [...] The railroad was designed and built by railway pioneer Gridley Bryant and began operations on October 7, 1826. Bryant used developments that had already been in use on the railroads in England, but he modified his design to allow for heavier, more concentrated loads and a three-foot frost line.|$|R
