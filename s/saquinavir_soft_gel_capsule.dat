The results indicated that amprenavir plasma concentrations were decreased by <b>saquinavir</b> <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> <b>capsule</b> (by 32 % for area under the concentration-time curve at steady state [AUCss] and 37 % for peak plasma concentration at steady state [Cmax,ss]) and increased by indinavir (33 % for AUCss). Nelfinavir significantly increased amprenavir minimum drug concentration at steady state (by 189 %) but did not affect amprenavir AUCss or Cmax,ss. Nelfinavir and saquinavir steady-state pharmacokinetics were unchanged by coadministration with amprenavir compared with the historical monotherapy data. Concentrations of indinavir, coadministered with amprenavir, in plasma decreased in both single-dose and steady-state evaluations. The changes in amprenavir steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters, relative to those for amprenavir alone, were not consistent among protease inhibitors, nor were the changes consistent with potential interactions in CYP 3 A 4 metabolism or P-glycoprotein transport.

Retrospective analyses of virological and immunological responses following HAART {{have been evaluated}} in both blood and lymph nodes according to pre-treatment levels of CD 4 cells either above or below 500 x 10 (6) /l. DESIGN: Open-label, observational, non-randomized, prospective study. SETTING: Outpatients attending the Centre of Clinical Investigation in Infectious Diseases, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, University of Lausanne, Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-four HIV- 1 -infected antiretroviral-naive subjects with CD 4 cell count > or = 250 x 10 (6) /l and plasma viraemia > or = 5000 copies/ml who had been treated with HAART for at least 48 weeks. Controls were 49 HIV-negative subjects. INTERVENTIONS: All patients received abacavir, nelfinavir, <b>saquinavir</b> <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> <b>capsules,</b> and amprenavir in varying combinations for 72 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The extent of immune reconstitution following HAART in 43 and 11 subjects with either more or fewer than 500 x 10 (6) CD 4 cells/l at baseline was evaluated in blood and lymph node, and compared with immunological measures observed in 49 HIV-negative controls. RESULTS: After 48 weeks of therapy, plasma viraemia was suppressed effectively in both groups of patients. Normalization of both CD 4 cell count in blood, divided equally between memory and naive cells, and percentage of CD 4 cells in lymph nodes occurred in the two groups. Consistently, the net increase over baseline in CD 4 cell count and in memory and naive CD 4 subsets was greater in patients with fewer than 500 x 10 (6) CD 4 cells/l at baseline. Recovery of HIV-specific responses was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that virological and immunological responses are comparable in asymptomatic therapy-naive HIV- 1 -infected subjects with CD 4 cell counts above or below 500 x 10 (6) /l...|$|R

Methods: A quantitative telephone survey of eligible adults (n = 400, &ge; 18 years old) who currently take (n = 236) or previously took (n = 164) VP tablets within the past 6 months was conducted. Results: More than half of the patients indicated that VP tablets were &lsquo;uncomfortable to swallow&rsquo; (68. 5 %, n = 274) and were &lsquo;very interested&rsquo; (65. 8 %, n = 263) in medications that were easier to swallow.

40|$|Introduction: Levothyroxine (l-T 4) is the {{mainstay}} of treating hypothyroidism. The tablet is the traditional formulation of l-T 4. Tablet l-T 4 malabsorption results from either hindered gastric dissolution of the tablet or binding of l-T 4 by sequestrants in the intestinal lumen. Areas covered: This review {{provides an overview of}} the pharmacokinetics of l-T 4 formulations available in the market: the tablet, the <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> <b>capsule</b> and the oral solution. We review literature on the new formulations and anticipate the areas of future research. Expert opinion: Failure of l-T 4 treatment to reach target serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels generally prompts the physicians to increase l-T 4 daily dose. In vitro {{studies have shown that the}} <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> <b>capsule</b> releases the active ingredient more consistently at varying pH than the tablet. In addition, in vivo studies have confirmed the in vitro data and have demonstrated that both the <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> <b>capsule</b> and the liquid formulation are capable to solve tablet l-T 4 malabsorption caused by certain drugs, bariatric surgery or coffee. These new formulations may be attractive also for patients who cannot/do not want to change their (improper) habits of l-T 4 ingestion.

40|$|Background. Recently, it {{has been}} shown that liquid L-T 4 {{formulation}} can be ingested with breakfast. This study looked to extend these findings by investigating whether a <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> <b>capsule</b> formulation of L-T 4 could also be ingested at breakfast time. Methods. 60 patients (18 – 65 [*]yrs), previously submitted to thyroidectomy for proven benign goitre in stable euthyroidism receiving liquid L-T 4 therapy ingested with breakfast, were enrolled. TSH, fT 4, and fT 3 levels were assessed in all the patients who were switched from liquid L-T 4 to a <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> <b>capsule</b> formulation at the same dosage of L-T 4. After 6 months, TSH, fT 4, and fT 3 levels were determined again. Results. There were no differences in TSH levels, but fT 3 and fT 4 levels during treatment with the <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> <b>capsule</b> were significantly lower than those at enrolment with the liquid L-T 4 formulation (TSH median (min–max) : 1. 9 (0. 5 – 4. 0) versus 2. 2 (0. 5 – 4. 5) mIU/L, fT 3 : 2. 5 (2. 4 – 3. 1) versus 2. 7 (2. 4 – 3. 3) pg/mL, p< 0. 05, and fT 4 : 9. 9 (8. 0 – 13) versus 10. 6 (8. 6 – 13. 8) pg/mL, p< 0. 0001).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{most recent}} advance {{concerning}} levothyroxine (L-T 4) therapy {{is the development}} of novel oral formulations: the liquid preparation, and the <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> <b>capsule.</b> AREAS COVERED: This review evaluates the most recent clinical studies about these new formulations. The liquid formulation has been shown to overcome: the food and beverages intereference with L-T 4 tablets absorption, caused by food or coffee at breakfast; malabsorption induced by the increased gastric pH, resulting from atrophic gastritis, or due to proton-pump inhibitors; and malabsorption after bariatric surgery. The use of liquid L-T 4 has been studied also in pregnancy, newborns and infants, suggesting a better bioequivalence than tablets. Finally, liquid L-T 4 is more active than tablets in the control of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in hypothyroid patients without malabsorption, drug interference, or gastric disorders, leading to a hypothesized higher absorption of liquid L-T 4 also in these patients. Few studies have evaluated <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> L-T 4 with promising results in patients with malabsorption related to coffee or gastritis.

We compared the tolerability, quality of life (QoL), and formulation preference after switching from LPV/r SGC to the tablet formulation. Methods In a prospective, single-arm, cohort study-design, 74 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected subjects stable on LPV/r-based therapy were enrolled prior to (n = 25) or 8 weeks (n = 49) after switching from SGC to tablet.

40|$|Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is an {{important}} micronutrient with several pharmacologic as well as antioxidant properties. Oral formulations present problems due to characteristics of the molecule and of the pharmaceutical forms. It is known that ALA is poorly soluble; therefore to increase the solubility was reticulated in an amphiphilic matrix like lecithin. The goal {{of the present study}} was to characterize the bioavailability of new formulation and to compare the human pharmacokinetics profiles of two different pharmaceutical form: tablets and <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> <b>capsules</b> following single oral administration of a ALA 600 mg. Blood samples were collected up to 8 h post dosing, and plasma á-lipoic acid concentrations were determined by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) detection. The results revealed that after rapid dissolution there is a good solubilisation by lecithin and that the two formulations show the same human pharmacokinetic profile. Tablet formulation is more versatile than soft capsules because it makes it possible to administer 600 mg of ALA with good compliance.

40|$|Abstract Background The tablet {{formulation}} of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r; Kaletra ®) has many advantages over the <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> <b>capsule</b> (SGC) formulation, including lower pill count, no refrigeration requirement, and no dietary restrictions. These advantages may help improve patient compliance and therefore increase adherence to treatment. However, there are limited data regarding patient preferences and only recently was the comparative efficacy and tolerability data of LPV/r SGC versus tablet formulation presented {{at an international}} conference. To address this deficit, we conducted a market research survey to assess potential tolerability benefits, patient satisfaction, changes in adherence, and formulation preference in patients switching from SGCs to the tablet formulation. Data from 332 patients who switched from LPV/r SGCs twice-daily (BID) to tablets BID and 41 patients who switched from LPV/r SGCs BID or once daily (QD) to tablets QD were analyzed. Results Switching from SGCs to a tablet {{formulation of}} LPV/r was associated with increased patient satisfaction, tolerability and self-reported adherence to treatment; gastrointestinal side effects were reduced. In addition, {{respondents indicated that they}} preferred the tablet formulation to the SGC. Conclusion The LPV/r tablet formulation provides HIV-infected patients with multiple benefits over the SGC in terms of tolerability and convenience. Additional assessments to further define the tolerability profile of the LPV/r tablet, including studies using once-daily dosing, are warranted. </p...|$|R

In part 1 of the study, single oral doses of BCV ranged from 25 mg to 800 mg. In part 2, single oral doses of BCV ranged from 10 mg to 300 mg and were coadministered with 100 -mg oral ritonavir (RTV) <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> <b>capsules.</b> Single doses of BCV and BCV/RTV were generally well tolerated.

40|$|The pure {{mammalian}} gelatin <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> <b>capsules</b> on {{the market}} today dissolve after a short time in the acidic environment in the ventricle. Problems related to this are loss of functionality of the drug contained in the capsule and discomfort due to reflux when ingesting e. g. capsules containing fish oil. One of the aims {{of this study was to}} improve the composition of gelatin <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> <b>capsules,</b> so the release of capsule content is delayed until it reaches the small intestine. This controlled release will give more efficient delivery of certain acid-sensitive drugs, and reduce discomfort for the consumer. It was also desirable to incorporate fish gelatin (FG) in the capsules, while retaining the gel strength. In order for the systems to be used in <b>capsule</b> production, the <b>gel</b> strength must be adequate for the gels to with stand the strain inflicted on them during the encapsulation process. Based on the promising results of previous work on kappa-carrageenan (κCG) /gelatin mixtures, the approach of this study was to apply iota-carrageenan (ιCG) in mixture with gelatin. The greater net negative charge of ιCG compared to κCG indicated that it would interact stronger with net positively charged gelatin, resulting in stronger films. The second main objective of this work was to gain better understanding of the interaction between ιCG and gelatin and the phase separation that occurs in these mixtures. ιCG/gelatin mixtures of different compositions were tested as films in diffusion/dissolution experiments that mimic the in-vivo conditions in the ventricle, and the rate of release of paracetamol through the films was measured. From small strain oscillatory measurements the gel strength (G’), melting temperature and gelling temperature for the gels was obtained. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on films under different conditions, giving denaturation temperature and enthalpy change related to denaturation on a molecular level and phase transition. The mean percent released paracetamol in the diffusion/dissolution experiments was decreased from 100 % for the pure mammalian gelatin (MG) films, to 4. 4 % for the most acid-resistant MG/ιCG films. The gel strength of the gels with ιCG was lower than for the pure mammalian gelatin, due to lower content of mammalian gelatin. A strong correlation between gel strength and concentration of MG was observed. The FG/ιCG films had relatively low release of paracetamol, but the gel strength was too low for capsule production. Diffusion experiments and rheology measurements were performed on ιCG/MG and κCG/MG systems of constant composition except from varying type of cation present. This revealed that the properties of the ιCG/MG films were relatively independent of the salt concentration and cation type present. In comparison, the κCG/MG systems showed high dependence of the κCG specific cation K+. DSC measurements showed an increase in denaturation temperature for the films with ιCG. This indicates that the ιCG participates in stabilization of the helical junction zones in gelatin, so more energy is required for denaturation of the gel network. Visual observation of type A MG/ιCG and type B MG/ιCG mixtures, as well as of films of the same type in artificial gastric juice, showed increased turbidity when the pH was lower than the IEP of the respective gelatin. This indicates that an associative phase separation occurs due to electrostatic interaction between gelatin and ιCG. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Levothyroxine (L-T 4) {{treatment}} with coffee, or with water followed by coffee {{within a few}} minutes, results in poor TSH response in many patients. Thyroxine is worldwide suitable in tablets form but novel formulations in <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> <b>capsule</b> or liquid formulation are now available. DESIGN: We fortuitously observed an euthyroid patient who wrongly assumed liquid L-T 4 with coffee at breakfast: after changing the assumption thirty minutes before breakfast, no change of TSH, fT 4 and fT 3 was observed. Once the first patient was identified, we identified additional stable euthyroid patients who assumed liquid L-T 4 with coffee. METHODS: Patients were recruited by searching our "thyroid patients" database. All patients on liquid L-T 4 treatment were contacted by phone {{to find out if}} L-T 4 was taken at breakfast. We identified fifty-four patients that were submitted to TSH, fT 4 and fT 3 evaluation, with the following indication to assume the same dosage of L-T 4 half hour before breakfast. We checked again their TSH, fT 4 and fT 3 values, 3 and 6 months later. RESULTS: No significative difference of thyroid hormonal values was observed between patients who assumed L-T 4 at breakfast and after 3 and 6 months of its assumption half hour before breakfast [TSH : 2. 5 ± 1. 1 vs 2. 5 ± 1. 1 and 2. 4 ± 1. 1 (mIU/L), respectively], [fT 4 : 12. 4 ± 2. 4 vs 12. 5 ± 2. 4 and 12. 3 ± 2. 1 (pg/mL), respectively] and [fT 3 : 3. 4 ± 0. 6 vs 3. 4 ± 0. 6 and 3. 3 ± 0. 5 (pg/mL), respectively].

RESULTS: Of the 19 children, 8 were female, median age was 13 years (range 7 - 16) and median BW was 29. 4 kg. The median duration of darunavir/ritonavir treatment was 11 months. The geometric mean values for darunavir were 60. 3 hxmg/l for the area under the concentration-time curve at 0 - 12 h (AUC(0 - 12)), 8. 3 mg/l for the maximum concentration (C(max)) and 3. 1 for the concentration prior to the next dose (C(12)) with no differences between dosing groups.

To determine the reasons for therapeutic failure, genotypic and phenotypic resistance test results and SQV concentrations in plasma were analyzed and compared to those in successfully treated patients (viral load of < 200 copies/ml at W 24) (group 2). Reverse transcriptase and protease genotypic analyses in group 1 revealed the acquisition of only one SQV-associated mutation (L 90 M) in only two patients. There was no {{significant increase in the}} 50 or 90 % inhibitory concentration of SQV in patients with or without the L 90 M mutation. However, the fact that two patients developed an L 90 M mutation only 4 weeks after relapse points to the need for genotypic resistance testing {{in the context of an}} initial failure of the antiretroviral regimen. At W 24, the median SQV concentration in group 1 (71 ng/ml) was significantly lower than in group 2 (475 ng/ml), and the plasma SQV concentration was correlated with the viral load at W 24 (r = − 0. 5; P < 0. 05) and with the drop in viral load between day 0 and W 24 (r = − 0. 5; P < 0. 01). These results and the fact that the plasma SQV concentrations in the two groups prior to relapse (W 12) were not significantly different strongly suggest that the early failure of this combination is not due to viral resistance but to a lack of compliance, pharmacological variability, and drug interactions or a combination of these factors...|$|R

In the present work direct compaction grade powders comprising omega- 3 oil as triglycerides or ethyl esters were prepared utilizing ß-cyclodextrin as encapsulating agent. Powders with omega- 3 oil load ranging from 10 - 40 % (w/w) have been prepared by vacuum drying, freeze drying or spray granulation of aqueous mixtures of omega- 3 oil and ß- cyclodextrin. Spray granulation proved to be the superior drying method for the preparation of compactible powders. Powder X-ray diffractograms of the powders and crushed tablets show evidence of formation of new crystalline phases not present in pure ß-cyclodextrin, indicating true complexation of ethyl ester and triglycerides. 1 H NMR data confirmed presence of ethyl ester:ß-CD inclusion complexes. The compactibility of the powders was explored by the preparation of tablets containing 20 - 40 % (w/w) omega- 3 oil as triglycerides or ethyl esters. It was found that powders with up to 35 % (w/w) triglyceride oil and 30 % (w/w) ethyl ester oil, respectively, could be directly compressed to tablets of good quality. Recent years focus on the health benefits from omega- 3 fatty acids has caused foundation for a diverse assortment of omega- 3 supplements concerning quality. The discovery of a relatively extended sale of low quality products in several markets has resulted in an increased focus on essential properties of omega- 3 products, like bioavailability of the omega- 3 fatty acids from the formulation and oxidative stability through shelf-life. The present work demonstrates that direct compaction grade powders based on spray granulated triglyceride oil and ß-cyclodextrin, the corresponding tablet cores and coated tablets can be prepared with sufficiently low oxidation values to satisfy relevant monographs for omega- 3 products, i. e. with initial totox values of the respective formulations < 10. Increasing levels of ascorbic acid in the formulation was correlated with lower totox values; however, the combination with EDTA as processing agent proved necessary to ensure sufficient oxidative stability of triglyceride powders. Spray granulating under nitrogen atmosphere contributed to significantly decreased totox levels in powders after eight months of storage at accelerated temperature (37 oC), compared to spray granulation in air. In longterm stability studies, it was confirmed that coated triglyceride tablets remained at totox level < 10 after one year of storage at ambient temperature. The bioavailability of EPA and DHA from the triglyceride tablets comprising 30 % (w/w) triglyceride oil was established. It was found that the bioavailability, measured as relative levels of EPA and DHA in serum, was comparable to soft-gel capsules. It was further observed that time for maximum concentration of EPA and DHA in serum was significantly shorter administered as tablets compared to as soft-gels...|$|R
40|$|Os óleos de peixes de clima frio têm atraído a atenção do consumidor graças à presença de ácidos graxos ômega três de cadeia longa. São uma rica fonte de ácidos graxos poli-insaturados, EPA e DHA, de ação hipocolesterolêmica reconhecida, que reduz sua estabilidade oxidativa, podendo comprometer a qualidade e funcionalidade. Essa pesquisa teve como objetivo estudar a estabilidade de óleo de peixe em cápsulas de gelatina moles acondicionadas em diferentes tipos de embalagens: metade das cápsulas em blísters e metade em frascos. A emblistagem foi realizada com os filmes de policlorotrifluoroetileno (PCTFE), comercializado sob o nome Aclar Rx 160 (15 &# 956;m), cloreto de polivinilideno (PVDC- 60 gsm²) e policloreto de vinila (PVC- 250 &# 956;m), perfazendo três tratamentos. A outra metade das cápsulas foi acondicionada em frascos de polietileno de alta densidade (PEAD) com e sem sachês de sílica e de vidro de cor âmbar. Cada embalagem continha 60 cápsulas que foram armazenadas em triplicata à temperatura ambiente por 12 meses. O óleo foi analisado a cada 28 dias quanto ao índice de acidez, de peróxido e absortividade em 232 e 270 nm. A composição em ácidos graxos, especialmente quanto aos teores de EPA e DHA, foi determinada. A embalagem que apresentou as maiores alterações na qualidade do óleo foi o filme de PVC. Os melhores resultados foram obtidos com os frascos de PEAD com dessecante de sílica. Os teores de DHA e EPA mantiveram-se estáveis em todas as amostras. Due to the {{presence}} of long chained omega three fatty acids, fish oils have gathered much interest recently. Fish oils such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are a rich source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which reduce blood triacylglycerol and cholesterol levels. However, the higher the unsaturation level, the less stable is the oil which may haveits functionality reduced due to oxidation. This research main interest was the stability of encapsulated fish oil stored in different types of packagings. The fish oil used in this experiment was supplied by Cardinal Pharmaceutical Industry in <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> <b>capsules.</b> After encapsulation, half of the samples were sent to SERPAC Industry LTDA for blistering, where polychlortrifluoroethylene (PCTFE), commercially known as Aclar Rx 160 (15 &# 956;), polyvinyldichloride (PVDC- 60 gsm²), and polyvinylchoride (PVC- 250 &# 956;) films were used as treatments. The blisters were packed in carton boxes. The other half of the capsules was packed in amber glass or high density polyethylene (PEAD) rigid flasks with and without silica bags. Each treatment contained 60 capsules in triplicate and all packs were stored under ambient conditions for 12 months. Analytical determinations were performed on the oil every 28 days and included acid and peroxide values and absortivities in the ultraviolet region at 232 and 270 nm. The fatty acid composition determinations, specifically EPA and DHA content, were performed during the experiment. The package which presented the largest changes in quality of the oil was the PVC film "blister". The best results were found in the encapsulated oil stored in PEAD flasks with silica bags. EPA and DHA contents were kept constant for all samples...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSubstrate {{stiffness}} {{is emerging}} as an important physical factor in the response of many cell types. In agreement with findings on other anchorage-dependent cell lineages, aortic smooth muscle cells are found to spread and organize their cytoskeleton and focal adhesions much more so on “rigid” glass or “stiff” gels than on “soft” gels. Whereas these cells generally show maximal spreading on intermediate collagen densities, the limited spreading on <b>soft</b> <b>gels</b> is surprisingly insensitive to adhesive ligand density. Bell-shaped cell spreading curves encompassing all substrates are modeled by simple functions that couple ligand density to substrate stiffness. Although smooth muscle cells spread minimally on <b>soft</b> <b>gels</b> regardless of collagen, GFP-actin gives a slight overexpression of total actin that can override the <b>soft</b> <b>gel</b> response and drive spreading; GFP and GFP-paxillin {{do not have the}} same effect. The GFP-actin cells invariably show an organized filamentous cytoskeleton and clearly indicate that the cytoskeleton is at least one structural node in a signaling network that can override spreading limits typically dictated by <b>soft</b> <b>gels.</b> Based on such results, we hypothesize a central structural role for the cytoskeleton in driving the membrane outward during spreading whereas adhesion reinforces the spreading...|$|R

The mechanical change can drive cell function in cell types of both the liver and central nervous system. The shear moduli of fibrotic liver and healthy rat brain tissue measured by rheology are mimicked with mechanically controllable polyacrylamide and fibrin gels as cell substrates to model tissue disease states in vitro. A new technique for conjugating proteins to the polyacrylamide gel surface is also described. Astrocytes exhibit compliance-dependent cytoskeletal and focal adhesion reorganization and stellation.
