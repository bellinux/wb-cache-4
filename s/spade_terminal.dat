50|$|The {{connectors}} {{in the top}} row of {{the image}} are known as ring terminals and spade terminals (sometimes called fork or split ring terminals). Electrical contact is made by the flat surface of the ring or spade, while mechanically they are attached by passing a screw or bolt through them. The <b>spade</b> <b>terminal</b> form factor facilitates connections since the screw or bolt can be left partially screwed in as the <b>spade</b> <b>terminal</b> is removed or attached. Their sizes can {{be determined by the}} size of the conducting wire AWG and the screw/bolt diameter size designation.|$|E
50|$|The H1 lamp uses a P14.5s base {{in accord}} with IEC 60061. This is a round metal prefocus base 14.5mm in {{diameter}} with a flat and two dimples so the H1 can be installed in a lamp only in the one correct orientation. There is one 6.35mm male <b>spade</b> <b>terminal</b> in {{the centre of the}} base, through which power is supplied. The H1 grounds through the metal base itself.|$|E
50|$|One type of {{terminal}} block accepts wires that are prepared only by removing (stripping) a short length of insulation from the end. Another type accepts wires that have ring or <b>spade</b> <b>terminal</b> lugs crimped onto the wires. Printed circuit board (PCB) mounted {{terminal block}}s allow individual wires {{to be connected}} to the circuit board. PCB mounted terminal blocks are soldered to the board, but they are available in a pull-apart version that allows the wire-connecting half of the block to be unplugged from the part that is soldered to the PCB.|$|E
