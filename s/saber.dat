5|$|<b>Saber</b> {{doubted that}} it would be able to convert Combat Evolveds split-screen {{cooperative}} play to facilitate online play. Greg Hermann, a 343 Industries technical lead who had experience with Bungie technology, assisted <b>Saber</b> in development of a networking solution that would allow online co-op. Since the original game would behave identically when given the same scenario and inputs, only the player inputs needed to be synchronized between players' Xbox consoles.|$|E

5|$|Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary was {{developed}} as a partnership between development studios 343 Industries, <b>Saber</b> Interactive, and Certain Affinity. 343 Industries, the Halo series' franchise overseers, approached <b>Saber</b> Interactive to develop a remake of the original Halo in time for its tenth anniversary.

A development tool for toggling between {{the old and new}} visuals became a game feature. Anniversarys enhancements include a complete high-definition visual overhaul, support for cooperative and multiplayer gameplay via the Xbox Live online service, new and remastered sound effects and music, and extras such as achievements and hidden in-game collectibles. The game is the first in the series to include Kinect support.|$|E

5|$|In 1837 France began a {{blockade}} of the Rio de la Plata against Rosas.

50|$|The White <b>Sabers</b> Drum and Bugle Corps was {{organized}} in 1928 under {{the sponsorship of}} the American Legion Daniel Goho Post #87 from Dansville, NY and later became independent in 1957. In 1994, after about 14 years of absence from the drum corps world, several former White <b>Sabers</b> members organized an alumni reunion, and an interest in performing was revived. In 2005, the White <b>Sabers</b> returned to the field as a competitive Class A drum corps. The following year, they competed and placed second in their first DCA World Championships in Rochester, NY on September 3, 2006. The membership dedicated their finals performance at the night show to Pete and Leslie Amico in deep appreciation of their supporting efforts. The White <b>Sabers</b> made DCA World Championships finals again in 2012, then achieved its first championship in DCA Class A in 2013. In 2014 they became the first A-class corps to win back-to-back championships, winning with the division's record score of 88.6 and marking two consecutive seasons of undefeated competition.

5|$|The Magyars were {{at first}} yet another wave of nomadic invaders. Of the Uralic {{languages}} family, coming from northwestern Siberia, they migrated south and west, occupying the Pannonian Basin {{from the end}} of the 9th century. From there, until the second half of the 10th century, when they were forced to settle, they raided and pillaged vast areas of Europe, including Poland. A <b>saber</b> and ornamental elements were found in a Hungarian warrior's grave from the first half of the 10th century in the Przemyśl area.|$|E
5|$|According to Najmabadi, {{occasionally}} we {{come across}} the lion and sun with a sword in the lion's paw and with a crown during this period. The Mohammad Shah's decree in 1836 states that the lion must erectly stand, bear a <b>saber</b> ("to make it explicitly stands for the military prowess of the state"). The crown was also added {{as a symbol of}} royalty rather than for any particular Qajar monarch. The decree states that the emblem is at once the national, royal, and the state emblem of Iran. In this period the lion was depicted as more masculine and the sun was female. Before this time the sun could be male or female and the lion was represented as a swordless, friendly and subdued seated animal.|$|E
5|$|Donald Gray, who {{had found}} himself typecast after {{appearing}} in the lead role in <b>Saber</b> of London, a detective series, was having to resort to voice work to support his acting career. The South African actor was selected for three regular roles: Colonel White, Captain Black and the Mysterons. After his mind is hijacked in the pilot episode, Black speaks with the same voice that the Mysterons are heard to use when transmitting threats to Earth. For his portrayals of Black and his Mysteron masters, Gray's voice was electronically deepened, by running the tape at high speed whilst he was recording his lines and playing it back at normal speed, to produce a haunting effect.|$|E

5|$|Ethiopia has a long, {{historical}} {{reputation as}} a place where the weapon dance plays an important cultural role. According to Lucian, a Greek writer from the 2nd century, “The Ethiopians dance also during the battle. The Ethiopian never shoots his arrow without dancing and making a menacing gesture beforehand. He wants to frighten the enemy by his dance beforehand.” The broad range of weapon dances includes the hota jumping dance of Amharic males; the attack dance of the Hailefo; the stick-dance of the Kullo; the Beroronsi Hama Haban, a dramatic dagger dance of the Esa; and the shire, the <b>saber</b> dance of the Tigrean nomadic shepherds.|$|E
5|$|San Martín's {{column was}} the first one to reach the enemy. The two cannons and the cannon fire from the ships defended the royalists, but they were quickly outmanoeuvred by the <b>saber</b> attacks and, unable to form a square, had to retreat. The {{advantage}} of surprise and the speed of the cavalry charge allowed the regiment to defeat the larger royalist army who had almost double the number of soldiers. When Bermúdez and his column joined the battle the royalists were not able to stand their ground and were routed, retreating in disarray under covering fire from the ships. Bermudez led the attack at this point as San Martín had fallen from his horse.|$|E
5|$|Sobieski was {{a member}} of the Polish defense crew besieged by Cossacks at Zbaraż from 10 July to 22 August 1649. In 1650 he fought against the Cossacks at Kamieniec Podolski.

After the Polish victory, due his bravery, he {{received}} a <b>saber</b> of Tugay Bey, who had been killed during the battle. In September 1651 he fought at the Battle of Biała Cerkiew. When the Poles, Cossacks and Tatars began negotiations, Marek Sobieski was sent to the Cossack camp as a guarantor of safety for the Cossack leader, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, who was in the Polish camp.|$|E
