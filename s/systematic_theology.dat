5|$|Beginning in 1549, Vermigli became {{involved}} in controversy regarding the Eucharist. He published his disputation with Catholics at Oxford University along with a tract on the subject. He later wrote treatises on the Eucharist against Catholics as well as Lutherans. After Vermigli's death, Robert Masson collected the doctrinal passages scattered throughout these commentaries into a <b>systematic</b> <b>theology</b> called the Loci Communes, which became Vermigli's most well-known work. Several of Vermigli's letters and shorter treatises were also published during and after his life. Beginning in 1994, scholars began translating his works into modern English in a series called the Peter Martyr Library.|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the essence of {{religion}} proposed by Schleiermacher, namely ‘the feeling of absolute dependence upon the Infinite’. In his theory of religious experience, and the language he used to express it, he claimed his work to be independent of concepts and beliefs. Epistemologically this is incompatible. In our century, where Christianity needs to be reinterpreted {{in the light of}} modern science, Schleiermacher has left us with a hermeneutical challenge to communicate the dynamic experience of a relationship with God in an intelligible way. The author argues that <b>systematic</b> <b>theology’s</b> obligation to rationality must at least include a dialectic interplay of interpretative schemes, events and experience...|$|R
5|$|Peter Martyr Vermigli (8 September 149912 November 1562) was an Italian-born Reformed theologian. His {{early work}} as a {{reformer}} in Catholic medieval Italy and decision to flee for Protestant northern Europe influenced many other Italians to convert and flee as well. In England, he influenced the Edwardian Reformation, including the Eucharistic service of the 1552 Book of Common Prayer. He was considered an authority on the Eucharist among the Reformed churches, and engaged in controversies on the subject by writing treatises. Vermigli's Loci Communes, a compilation of excerpts from his biblical commentaries organized by the topics of <b>systematic</b> <b>theology,</b> became a standard Reformed theological textbook.|$|E

50|$|Following the Synod of Dort, {{which ended}} in 1619, the Reformed began to give greater {{definition}} and detail to their theological system by writing comprehensive <b>systematic</b> <b>theologies.</b> The period was also characterized by intense polemical writing against several groups. The Remonstrants, having been repudiated in the synod of Dort, became an independent movement with their own seminary and dogmatic textbooks, and the Reformed wrote against them with even greater intensity. Reformed polemics were also directed against the increasingly influential Socinians, who denied the Trinity and other traditional Christian doctrines. Early Socinians had already had some influence {{on the development of}} Remonstrantism during the early orthodox period. In addition, the rise of Cartesianism provided another target for Reformed scholastics such as Dutch theologian Gisbertus Voetius, who argued that Descartes's philosophical skepticism placed reason above revelation instead of subjecting reason to biblical revelation.|$|R

5000|$|Tillich {{states in}} the {{introduction}} to the <b>Systematic</b> Theology: <b>Theology</b> formulates the questions implied in human existence, and theology formulates the answers implied in divine self-manifestation under the guidance of the questions implied in human existence.

50|$|Orthodox theologians reject Augustine's {{formulation}} {{of original sin}} and actively oppose the content and implications of John Calvin's conceptions of total depravity and irresistible grace, characteristic of Reformed Protestantism, {{as well as the}} Thomistic and scholastic theology which would become official Roman Catholic pedagogy. Eastern Christians typically view scholasticism and similarly discursive, <b>systematic</b> <b>theologies</b> as rationalistic corruptions of the theology of the Cappadocian and early Desert Fathers that led the Western Church astray into heresy. Orthodoxy teaches that it is possible and necessary for the human will to cooperate with divine grace for the individual to be saved, or healed from the disease of sin. This cooperation is called synergism (see also Semipelagianism and monergism), so that humans may become deified in conformity to the divine likeness—a process called theosis—by merging with the uncreated Energies of God (revealed to the senses as the Tabor Light of transfiguration), notably through a method of prayer called hesychasm.|$|R

40|$|The {{view that}} Ephesians 4 : 11 - 12 {{offers support to}} the concept of ‘every member ministry’ has {{recently}} been challenged. The KJV reading of this passage, which understands “the work of ministry” as belonging to church leaders and not church members, has been revived in various commentaries, journal articles, and even <b>systematic</b> <b>theologies.</b> In this article we survey the two major interpretations of these verses and critically discuss the exegetical, semantic, and theological issues which arise. In particular, it will be shown that the grammatical construction of the verses, as well as the context, support the notion that the ministry belongs not to the gifted individuals of verse 11, but to the saints of verse 12. Part of this task involves showing that the word “equip” better fits the context than “prepare” or “perfect”. Finally, it will be shown that this understanding is consistent with the general teaching of the New Testament. If Baptists are to maintain the principle of ‘The priesthood of all believers,’ and the related idea of ‘every member ministry,’ an accurate understanding of Ephesians 4 : 11 - 12 is paramount.
