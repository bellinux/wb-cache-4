40|$|AbstractSalt is an {{abiotic stress}} factor that {{strongly}} affects soybean growth and production. A single dominant gene {{has been shown}} to confer salt tolerance in the soybean cultivar Tiefeng 8. The objective {{of the present study was}} to genetically map the salt-tolerance gene in an F 2 : 3 population and a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between two cultivated soybeans, Tiefeng 8 (tolerant) and 85 - 140 (sensitive). The F 2 : 3 families and RILs were treated with 200 mmolL− 1 NaCl to evaluate salt tolerance. The F 2 : 3 population showed 1 (42 tolerant) : 2 (132 segregating) : 1 (65 sensitive) segregation, indicating a single dominant gene for salt tolerance in Tiefeng 8. A sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker from a previously identified random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker and four insertion/deletion polymorphism (InDel) markers were developed within the mapping region. Using these markers along with SSR markers, the salt-tolerance gene was mapped within 209 kb flanked by SCAR marker QS 08064 and SSR marker Barcsoyssr_ 3 _ 1301 on chromosome 3. Three markers that cosegregated with the <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>gene</b> and SCAR marker QS 08064 were used to genotype 35 tolerant and 23 sensitive soybean accessions.

40|$|Abstract Background Salinization causes {{negative}} effects on plant productivity and poses an increasingly {{serious threat to the}} sustainability of agriculture. Wild soybean (Glycine soja) can survive in highly saline conditions, therefore provides an ideal candidate plant system for <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>gene</b> mining. Results As a first step towards the characterization of genes that contribute to combating salinity stress, we constructed a full-length cDNA library of Glycine soja (50109) leaf treated with 150 mM NaCl, using the SMART technology. Random expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing of 2, 219 clones produced 2, 003 cleaned ESTs for gene expression analysis. The average read length of cleaned ESTs was 454 bp, with an average GC content of 40 %. These ESTs were assembled using the PHRAP program to generate 375 contigs and 696 singlets. The resulting unigenes were categorized according to the Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy. The potential roles of gene products associated with stress related ESTs were discussed. We compared the EST sequences of Glycine soja to that of Glycine max by using the blastn algorithm. Most expressed sequences from wild soybean exhibited similarity with soybean. All our EST data are available on the Internet (GenBank_Accn: DT 082443 ~ DT 084445). Conclusion The Glycine soja ESTs will be used to mine <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>gene,</b> whose full-length cDNAs will be obtained easily from the full-length cDNA library. Comparison of Glycine soja ESTs with those of Glycine max revealed the potential to investigate the wild soybean's expression profile using the soybean's gene chip. This will provide opportunities to understand the genetic mechanisms underlying stress response of plants. </p...|$|E
40|$|The <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>gene</b> SOS 3 (for salt overly {{sensitive}} 3) of Arabidopsis {{is predicted}} to encode a calcium binding protein with an N-myristoylation signature sequence. Here, we examine the myristoylation and calcium binding properties of SOS 3 and their functional significance in plant tolerance to salt. Treatment of young Arabidopsis seedlings with the myristoylation inhibitor 2 -hydroxymyristic acid caused the swelling of root tips, mimicking the phenotype of the salt-hypersensitive mutant sos 3 - 1. In vitro translation assays with reticulocyte showed that the SOS 3 protein was myristoylated. Targeted mutagenesis of the N-terminal glycine- 2 to alanine prevented the myristoylation of SOS 3. The functional significance of SOS 3 myristoylation was examined by expressing the wild-type myristoylated SOS 3 and the mutated nonmyristoylated SOS 3 in the sos 3 - 1 mutant. Expression of the myristoylated but not the nonmyristoylated SOS 3 complemented the salt-hypersensitive phenotype of sos 3 - 1 plants. No significant difference in membrane association was observed between the myristoylated and nonmyristoylated SOS 3. Gel mobility shift and 45 Ca 2 � overlay assays demonstrated that SOS 3 is a unique calcium binding protein and that the sos 3 - 1 mutation substantially reduced the capacity of SOS 3 to bind calcium. The resulting mutant SOS 3 protein {{was not able to}} interact with the SOS 2 protein kinase and was less capable of activating it. Together, these results strongly suggest that both N-myristoylation and calcium binding are required for SOS 3 function in plant salt tolerance...|$|E

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used as a quantification method for expression of both sequences in strains NN 2 - 1, RR 1128 and DS 2 grown with or without 3 % NaCl. The transposase sequences in strains NN 2 - 1 and RR 1128 were up-regulated by factors of 6. 45 and 3. 73 respectively in 3 % NaCl, but not in strain DS 2.

Using genome re-sequencing data from these accessions, we investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variation (CNV) in the 219 candidate genes in accessions of contrasting salinity tolerance, and identified 15 genes that could contribute to the differences in salinity tolerance of these Chenopodium accessions...|$|R
40|$|Halophytes of {{the lower}} coastal salt marsh show {{increased}} <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance,</b> and under high salinity they grow faster than upper marsh species. We could not show reduced growth rate of halophytes compared with glycophytes when grown under non-saline conditions. This indicates limited energy costs associated with high-salt tolerance in plants of genera such as Salicornia, providing a good perspective of saline agriculture cultivating Salicornia as a vegetable crop. We show that halophytes do not occur on non-saline or inland sites because of a reduced growth rate at low soil salinity, but probably due to other ecological traits of glycophytic upper marsh species. These traits provide competitive advantage over lower salt marsh halophytes, such as earlier germination and increased growing season length. Some halophytic Amaranthaceae (Salicornioideae, Chenopodioideae and Suaedoideae) are not just highly salt tolerant, their growth rate is stimulated at a salinity range of 150 – 300 mM NaCl. Alternatively this may be described as depressed growth at low salinity. Selective pressure for such high-salt <b>tolerance</b> and <b>salt</b> stimulated growth likely occurred with prevailing arid climate and saline soil conditions. Under such conditions highly-salt tolerant succulent Salicornioideae, Chenopodioidea and Suaedoideae may have evolved about 65 Mya. In the context of evolution and diversication of land plants this origin of highly-salt tolerant succulent plants is relatively recent. Such high-salt tolerance might be characterized as constitutive in comparison with inducible (lower) <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> of other dicotyledonae and monocotyledonae (Poaceae) species. Levels of <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the latter type span a large range of low, intermediate to high-salt tolerance, but do not include salt stimulated growth. Salt tolerant traits of the latter inducible type appear to have evolved repeatedly and independently. Early highly-salt tolerant succulent Salicornioideae, Chenopodioidea and Suaedoideae were perennial and frost sensitive and occurred in warm temperate and Mediterranean regions. A shift from the perennial Sarcocornia to an annual life form has been phylogenetically dated circa 9. 4 – 4. 2 Mya and enabled evolution of annual hygrohalophytes in more northern coastal locations up to boreal and subarctic coastal sites avoiding damage of winter frost. Diversification of such hygrohalophytes was facilitated by polyploidization (e. g. occurrence of tetraploid and diploid Salicornia species), and {{a high degree of}} inbreeding allowing sympatric occurrence of Salicornia species in coastal salt marshes. High-level <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> is probably a very complex polygenic trait. It is unlikely that glycophytes would accommodate the appropriate allelic variants at all the loci involved in halophyte <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance.</b> This might explain why attempts to improve crop <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> through conventional breeding and selection have been unsuccessful to date. Genetic engineering provides a viable alternative, but the choice for the appropriate transgenes is hampered by a fundamental lack of knowledge of the mechanisms of <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> in halophytes. The chances to identify the determinant genes through QTL analyses, or comparisons among near isogenic lines (NILS) are limited. Salt-tolerance is usually a species-wide trait in halophytes, and intra-specific divergence in <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> in facultative halophytes seems to be often associated with chromosomal incompatibility. A variety of candidate <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>genes</b> been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, among which genes encoding Na+ and K+ transporters, and genes involved in the general stress or anti-oxidant response, or in compatible solute metabolism. Many of these genes have been over-expressed in different glycophytic hosts, which usually appeared to alleviate, to some degree, the response to high salinity levels. However, with few exceptions, there are no indications that the same genes would be responsible for the superior <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> in (eu) halophytes. Comparisons of gene expression and gene promoter activity patterns between halophytes and glycophytes are, with few exceptions, virtually lacking, which is a major omission in current day <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> research. Full-genome transcriptomic comparisons between halophytes and related glycophytes through deep sequencing seem to be the most promising strategy to identify candidate genetic determinants of the difference in <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> between halophytes and glycophytes. The most reliable validation of any candidate gene is through silencing the gene in the halophytic genetic background, preferably down to the level at which it is expressed in the glycophyte reference species. This requires genetically accessible halophyte models, which are not available to date, with the exception of Thellungiella halophila. However, more models are required, particularly because T. halophila is not a typical halophyte. Eventually, the pyramiding of validated <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>genes</b> under suitable promoters may be expected to be a viable strategy for crop <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> improvement...|$|R

Using a different approach, Diaz-Martin et al. (2005) cloned a drought-related DREB transcription factor, HaDREB 2, in sunflower using gene interaction analyses. Meanwhile, Roche et al. (2007) analyzed the expression of genes associated with metabolism and signal transduction in leaves and immature embryos of sunflower using a cDNA array. Subsequently, 409 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 82 were organ specific and induced by drought stress. In addition, Kane and Risesberg (2007) identified candidate sunflower drought and <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>genes</b> using selective screening and discovered 17 genes that were induced by each of these stresses. Subsequently, Cheng et al. (2009) transformed the drought and salt resistance gene P 5 CS into sunflower and obtained six transformed buds which were resistant to Kan, thus showing that successful gene transfer and expression had occurred; however, no fertile transgenic plants were obtained. Soon thereafter, Sauca et al. (2011) introduced the same drought resistance gene into cultivated sunflower inbred lines using an embryo rescue technique. More recently, Yi et al.

Although drought and <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>genes</b> are present in wheat, breeding for stress tolerance is time- and labour-intensive and complicated by the multigenic nature of stress tolerance and the complexity of wheat genetics. The polyamine biosynthetic pathway in higher plants is a useful model in which to examine the components that affect the levels of intermediates and end products in the pathway. By introducing appropriate transgenes into plants and measuring the effects of transgene products on end product accumulation, we may begin to understand how individual components of the pathway contribute towards their concerted regulation 1. The polyamines spermidine and spermine, and their precursor putrescine, are ubiquitous in all living organisms and are involved in many diverse physiological, developmental, and biochemical processes. Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) -dependent ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is the initial enzyme in the pathway committed to polyamine synthesis. In plants and some bacteria, putrescine can also be synthesized from arginine via arginine decarboxylase (ADC) through the intermediate agmatine. Putrescine is further converted into spermidine and spermine by spermidine synthase (SPDS) and spermine synthase (SPMS), respectively. These enzymes add aminopropyl groups generated from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) by SAM decarboxylase (SAMDC). In plants, the two alternative pathways appear to have specific roles in growth and development.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Aquaporins (AQPs), {{with a major}} {{function}} as water channels, may play important roles in cell expansion. However, the roles of GhAQPs (Gh, Gossypium hirsutum) in cell expansion have not been clearly clarified. To address the roles of GhAQPs in plant cell expansion, this study aimed at identifying candidate GhAQPs involved in cotton fibre expansion by exploring their expression patterns and sub–cellular localization, examining their physiological roles in vivo, and exploring the cellular and molecular basis of the observed GhAQPs –mediated phenotypes. EST contigs were analysed by searching GhAQPs with high EST numbers in the cotton EST database (www. cottondb. com) to generate a preliminary selection of eight candidate GhAQPs possibly involved in cotton fibre elongation. These were four GhPIPs (GhPIP 1; 2, GhPIP 1; 3, GhPIP 2; 3, GhPIP 2; 4) and four GhTIPs (GhTIP 1; 1, GhTIP 1; 2, GhTIP 1; 4, GhTIP 2; 1). Semi–quantitative transcript analyses reviewed that GhAQPs were highly expressed during fibre expansion (5 – 15 days after anthesis, DAA) and relatively lower during the post expansion phase (~ 20 DAA onwards), which was generally consistent with temporal changes in rates of fibre elongation. These GhAQPs were also highly expressed in other expanding organs and more lowly expressed in expanded organs. GhPIP 2; 3 and GhTIP 1; 2 exhibited the highest transcript levels of all candidates, suggesting that GhPIP 2; 3 and GhTIP 1; 2 {{played a major role}} in cell expansion of cotton fibre and other organs, and thus were targeted as fibre expansion representatives for more detailed study. GhAQPs fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) constructs were transformed into WT Arabidopsis by floral dipping to determine the intracellular localization of GhAQPs. In addition, a parallel experiment was designed in which GhAQPs fused with red fluorescent protein (RFP) constructs were transformed into WT Arabidopsis and Arabidopsis transformed by a tonoplast marker ShMTP (magnesium transporter proteins) – GFP. For GhPIP 2; 3 and GhTIP 1; 2, a putative plasma membrane or tonoplast intracellular localization was discovered, respectively. There is a strong link between AQP localization and their functions. The cell membrane localization of GhPIP 2; 3 and GhTIP 1; 2 implied that these water channels would increase the permeability of the cell membranes, which reinforces their role in cell expansion. To examine the physiological role of identified GhAQPs in vivo, a complementation and an overexpression experiments were performed by transforming GhPIP 2; 3 /GhTIP 1; 2 into Arabidopsis (a time–saving model to study GhAQPs’ function) T–DNA insertion lines atpip 2; 3 – 1 /attip 1; 3 and WT respectively. The mutants atpip 2; 3 – 1 and attip 1; 3 exhibit reduced root length compared to WT when grown in the standard ½ MS medium or a medium containing 100 mM NaCl and reduced pollen tube length when grown in the standard medium or a medium without nitrogen (NO₃–) respectively. In this study, overexpression of GhPIP 2; 3 in pip 2; 3 – 1 and overexpression of GhTIP 1; 2 in tip 1; 3 respectively complemented the mutants’ short root and pollen tube lengths respectively in the standard medium or in other media (osmotic/salt stress and without nitrogen), which demonstrated that GhPIP 2; 3 and GhTIP 1; 2 really functioned as a PIP and a TIP respectively in planta (translated into functional proteins after transformation). Overexpression of GhPIP 2; 3 and GhTIP 1; 2 in WT Arabidopsis exhibited phenotypes of increased root/root cortex cell and pollen tube lengths respectively in ½ MS medium alone as well as modified ½ MS media causing osmotic/salt stress and nitrogen deficiency, suggesting that GhPIP 2; 3 and GhTIP 1; 2 played important roles in cell expansion. During cell expansion, GhAQPs were found to confer <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> by increasing water transport and diluting salt ions. It was also observed that the Arabidopsis root length didn’t show significant differences between their growth under NaCl and KCl stresses except the mutant showed shorter root length in 100 mM NaCl medium compared with in 100 mM KCl medium, suggesting Cl– might be the major ion performing toxicity and leading to the root reduction while Na+ toxicity also played some roles in root reduction. Three lines overexpressing GhPIP 2; 3 in WT showed significantly less reduced root length compared with WT in ½ MS + 100 mM NaCl medium compared with in ½ MS + 200 mM sorbitol medium, suggesting overexpression of GhPIP 2; 3 increased <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance.</b> In exploring the molecular basis of the observed increased root and pollen tube elongation in the lines overexpressing GhPIP 2; 3 and GhTIP 1; 2 respectively, a new phenomenon was found that overexpression of GhPIP 2; 3 and GhTIP 1; 2 could increase the expression of some sugar transporters (ERD 6 for GhPIP 2; 3, ERDL 6 and STP 11 for GhTIP 1; 2) and K + transporters (KC 1 and SKOR for GhPIP 2; 3) (except that SWEET 17 was decreased in overexpression of GhPIP 2; 3 lines, as decreasing the expression of SWEET 17 might help to maintain cytoplasmic sugar homeostasis or maintain the solutes concentration in the vacuole during cell expansion). The roles of GhPIP 2; 3 and GhTIP 1; 2 in cell expansion might be due to their water transport activity combined with their impact on elevating sugar and K + transporter expression that lowered cell water potentials with the overall effect of increasing turgor pressure to drive cell expansion. Another new discovery was that root hair length of the lines overexpressing GhPIP 2; 3 in WT were significantly increased compared with WT grown on MS medium containing 100 mM NaCl (½ MS + 100 mM NaCl). Meanwhile, three lines overexpressing GhPIP 2; 3 in pip 2; 3 – 1 background complemented the short root hair phenotype in the mutant in the ½ MS medium, and three lines overexpressing GhPIP 2; 3 in WT increased root hair length compared with WT in the ½ MS medium. At a molecular level overexpression of GhPIP 2; 3 was found to increase expression of root hair elongation related genes including AUX 1 (auxin transport), ETR 1 (ethylene receptor), Myosin XIK (Myosin XI) and EPC 1 (Glycosyltransferase), and some hair density related genes such as IAA 17 (Repressor of auxin–responsive transcription), PRP 3 (Proline–rich cell wall protein), RHD 6 (Protein ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6) and RHL 1 (Topoisomerase subunits). These findings suggested that overexpression of GhPIP 2; 3 might increase root hair elongation and hair density by inducing expression of these root hair elongation related genes (in addition to increasing cell turgor for hair elongation by enhancing water transport) and root hair density related genes. The molecular basis for the role of GhPIP 2; 3 on <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> was also explored. Among the <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>genes</b> chosen from NCBI and published papers, three <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>genes,</b> Rd 29 A (Responsive to desiccation 29 A), SAT 32 (Protein <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> 32) and SOS 1 (Sodium/hydrogen exchanger 7) were found to be higher expressed in the lines overexpressing GhPIP 2; 3 than in WT. It was proposed that overexpression of GhPIP 2; 3 increased <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> probably by a combination of increased water transport, increased root hair length and density, overlaid by enhancing expression of <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>genes.</b> Furthermore, one interesting discovery was that overexpression of GhPIP 2; 3 increased stomatal density, which might increase CO₂ assimilation, then contributed to transpiration and photosynthesis...|$|R

By contrast, IR 29 is reputedly highly salt-sensitive (Martinez-Atienza et al. 2006; Islam et al. 2011). Surprisingly, for the most salt-sensitive of the wild rice genotypes (Oa-D and Oa-KR) in very moderate salinity (40 [*]mM NaCl), biomass and ion concentrations were more strongly affected by salt than leaf symptoms, possibly indicating genotypic variation in tissue tolerance to NaCl, as reported earlier (Yeo et al. 1990). In reverse, the very slow absolute growth rates of IR 29 appeared, paradoxically, {{to result in a}} small effect of salt on relative growth rates (Fig. 3) but much larger effects on senescence (Fig. 1 a). This suggests that a range of performance criteria is essential to distinguish the intrinsic differences in <b>salt</b> <b>tolerances</b> in screening experiments. This underlines the polygenic nature of <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance,</b> where <b>genes</b> determining ion import, compartmentation and metabolic responses to salt are likely to play a collective role in physiological tolerance (Munns et al. 2008).

40|$|Abstract Background Despite {{wealth of}} {{information}} generated on <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> mechanism, its basics still remain elusive. Thus, {{there is a need}} of continued effort to understand the <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> mechanism using suitable biotechnological techniques and test plants (species) to enable development of salt tolerant cultivars of interest. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to generate information on salt stress responsive genes in a natural halophyte, Suaeda maritima, using PCR-based suppression subtractive hybridization (PCR-SSH) technique. Results Forward and reverse SSH cDNA libraries were constructed after exposing the young plants to 425 mM NaCl for 24 h. From the forward SSH cDNA library, 429 high quality ESTs were obtained. BLASTX search and TIGR assembler programme revealed overexpression of 167 unigenes comprising 89 singletons and 78 contigs with ESTs redundancy of 81. 8 %. Among the unigenes, 32. 5 % were found to be of special interest, indicating novel function of these genes with regard to <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Literature search for the known unigenes revealed that only 17 of them were salt-inducible. A comparative analysis of the existing SSH cDNA libraries for NaCl stress in plants showed that only a few overexpressing unigenes were common in them. Moreover, the present study also showed increased expression of phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase gene, indicating the possible accumulation of a much studied osmoticum, glycinebetaine, in halophyte under salt stress. Functional categorization of the proteins as per the Munich database in general revealed that <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> could be largely determined by the proteins involved in transcription, signal transduction, protein activity regulation and cell differentiation and organogenesis. Conclusion The study provided a clear indication of possible vital role of glycinebetaine in the <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> process in S. maritima. However, the salt-induced expression {{of a large number of}} genes involved in a wide range of cellular functions was indicative of highly complex nature of the process as such. Most of the salt inducible genes, nonetheless, appeared to be species-specific. In light of the observations made, it is reasonable to emphasize that a comparative analysis of ESTs from SSH cDNA libraries generated systematically for a few halophytes with varying salt exposure time may clearly identify the key <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> determinant <b>genes</b> to a minimum number, highly desirable for any genetic manipulation adventure. </p...|$|R

The objectives {{of this study were}} to identify new QTL or <b>genes</b> responsible for <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance</b> using three approaches: QTL mapping, association analysis, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). A salt-sensitive cultivar, RA- 452, was crossed with a salt-tolerant cultivar, Osage, to develop an F 4 -derived QTL mapping population. Composite interval mapping (CIM) analysis indicated that a major chloride (Cl-) -tolerant QTL was confirmed and narrowed down on Chr. 3 in both NaCl and KCl treatments, a novel Cl [...] tolerant QTL on Chr. 15 was identified in NaCl treatment, and a novel Cl [...] tolerant QTL on Chr. 13 was identified in KCl treatment. Based on the results from the screening of the RA- 452 x Osage mapping population, two F 4 : 6 lines with extreme responses, most tolerant and most sensitive, were selected for a time-course gene expression study. A total of 2374, 998, 1746, and 630 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between salt-tolerant line and salt-sensitive line, were found at 0, 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively. The gene expression profiles of six genes including Glyma. 02 G 228100, Glyma. 03 G 031400, Glyma. 04 G 180300, Glyma. 04 G 180400, Glyma. 05 G 204600, and Glyma. 17 G 173200 were verified by qRT-PCR. In addition, a total of 283 diverse germplasm lines were obtained from the Germplasm Resource Information Network (GRIN) and screened for salt stress response in greenhouse. A total of 33, 009 SNPs across 283 genotypes were employed in the association analysis with leaf chloride concentration and leaf chlorophyll concentration. Association analysis results confirmed the salt-tolerance QTL on Chr. 3 and revealed eight new putative QTL on Chr. 2, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, and 20. These QTL and linked SNP markers will be useful for MAS in breeding salt-tolerant soybean varieties...|$|R
40|$|In Arabidopsis thaliana, the SOS 1 (Salt Overly Sensitive 1) locus is {{essential}} for Na+ and K+ homeostasis, and sos 1 mutations render plants more sensitive to growth inhibition by high Na+ and low K+ environments. SOS 1 is cloned and predicted to encode a 127 -kDa protein with 12 transmembrane domains in the N-terminal part and a long hydrophilic cytoplasmic tail in the C-terminal part. The transmembrane region of SOS 1 has significant sequence similarities to plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporters from bacteria and fungi. Sequence analysis of various sos 1 mutant alleles reveals several residues and regions in the transmembrane {{as well as the}} tail parts that are critical for SOS 1 function in plant <b>salt</b> <b>tolerance.</b> SOS 1 <b>gene</b> expression in plants is up-regulated in response to NaCl stress. This up-regulation is abated in sos 3 or sos 2 mutant plants, suggesting that it is controlled by the SOS 3 /SOS 2 regulatory pathway...|$|R
