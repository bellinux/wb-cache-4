In Japan, a hard recession was observed for the last quarter in 2008 and the first quarter in 2009 ，and this paper reveals it was caused by an extremely high speed of the production and the inventory adjustments, which are suggested to be due to the foreign inventory adjustment in Japanese exporting countries.

We use a new firm-level dataset on the foreign activities of German firms to test whether foreign activities are affected by business cycle developments. We aggregate the data by the sector of the reporting firm, the sector of the foreign affiliate, and the host country. Data are annual and cover the period 1989 - 2003.

40|$|How does foreign {{competition}} affect growth and innovation in China? Using our unique measures of proximity of Chinese firms and industries {{to the world}} technology frontier, we find that despite vast sectoral heterogeneity, Chinese manufacturing industries have undergone rapid technological upgrading over the period of 2000 – 06. The distance to the world production frontier of firms and industries {{plays an important role}} in shaping the nexus between the competition pressure from foreign imports and domestic firms' growth and innovation behaviour. Our results support the theoretical predictions of Aghion et al. (2005, The Quarterly Journal of Economics, pp. 701 – 728) that import competition stimulates the domestic firms' productivity growth and R&# 38;D expenditure if firms and their industries are close to the world frontier, but discourages such incentives for laggard firms and industries. The two forces highlighted by the model operate for imports under the ordinary-trade regime, for collective and private firms, and for imports originated from high-income countries.

40|$|The Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) {{model is}} a {{component}} of the MIT Integrated Earth Systems Model (IGSM). Here, we provide an overview of the model accessible to a broad audience and present the detailed structure, data, and parameterization of the model for specialists in economic modeling. EPPA projects emissions of most of the climatically important substances emitted as a result of human activities including carbon dioxide (CO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N₂O), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6), sulfate aerosols (SOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), black carbon, organic carbon, and ammonia (NH 3). We present an updated and consistent inventory for 1995 of all of these emissions disaggregated to the regional and sectoral levels we use in EPPA. This more complete inventory of climatically important substances shows non-energy sources (e. g. agriculture, biomass burning) and developing countries to be important current sources of many of these emissions. A major use of EPPA, a computable general equilibrium model of the world economy with regional and sectoral detail, is to estimate the cost of greenhouse gas emissions control over the 100 -year horizon of the model. Reference projections show rates of improvement in energy use per unit of output (Gross Domestic Product) consistent with historical rates although in EPPA we do not attempt to model <b>short-term</b> <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> behavior so that our projections do not show the same variability as the historical data. Emissions of climatically important substances mostly grow over time in our reference projection (although rates differ substantially among them) despite considerable improvements in energy efficiency and reductions in emissions coefficients for other substances. Developing countries as group become larger sources of all greenhouse gas emissions than developed or transition economies {{by the middle of the}} century as their economies and populations are projected to grow more rapidly. There remain many uncertainties in projections of this type. The projections presented in this report are a starting point (i. e. reference) for evaluating alternative scenarios and climate policies.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} has {{two main}} objectives. The {{first one is}} to construct historical macroeconomic series for Sweden using a consistent method throughout the relevant periods, and which rely on modern methods of national accounting. The second objective is to investigate patterns of economic growth, accumulation and crisis in Sweden 1800 - 2000, based on the constructed data series. New annual data series of Gross Domestic Product and its division into activities (type of production) and expenditures (consumption, investment and foreign trade), Net Domestic Product, stocks of produced assets and consumption of fixed assets are constructed for the period 1800 - 2000; series of employment, wages, imputed labour income of self employed and surplus for the period 1850 - 2000; and series of worked hours for the period 1950 - 2000. Summary tables of the main aggregate variables are presented {{at the end of}} the dissertation. The intent is to make the data material available online (also at a more disaggregated level) at: [URL] Although the present study criticises the somewhat deterministic vision of many long cycle theories, it also demonstrates that the concept of long cycle can be applied when studying long-term fluctuations in GDP per capita, provided that the notion of a fixed periodicity of long cycles is abandoned. Long-term economic fluctuations are irregular, but so is also the <b>short-term</b> <b>business</b> <b>cycle.</b> Different historical tendencies and trends are investigated. The decline of the relative size of industrial activities in the last half of 20 th century was not as dramatic, if unpaid household labour is considered and that many services are industry-related. The Marxist theory of a Tendency for the Rate of Profit to Fall is partly confirmed as a secular process up to the 1970 s, but profitability has rebounded in the last two decades of the 20 th century. During the 1990 s, the investment ratio declined to historically low levels and the volume value of the net stock of buildings and structures fell for the first time since the 1830 s. A comparison is also made of depressions in Sweden since 1850. During the 19 th century, depressions were largely induced by the agricultural sector, and during the 20 th century by industrial activities. However, the transition to the modern business cycle was not sudden but rather protracted. Another finding is that the 1990 s depression was somewhat deeper than the 1930 s depression in terms of GDP contraction...|$|E
40|$|There is {{controversy}} {{about whether a}} monetary union is feasible in the East Asian region. Amongst the criteria for establishing a monetary union, most of the existing studies focus on the symmetric issue of fundamental shocks {{and the extent of}} correlations by applying the Blanchard and Quah (1989) structural vector autoregression (VAR) technique, which includes the firstdifferenced variables in the model and examines only bilateral relationships. When forming a monetary union, the member countries need to renounce their monetary policy autonomy. If shocks to respective economies are symmetric, the cost of relinquishing the discretionary monetary policy is likely to be outweighed by the benefits of establishing a common currency. In contrast, if shocks are asymmetric, it will be more costly to give up the autonomous monetary policy and, hence, to establish a monetary union. However, the shock symmetry does not necessarily mean the comovements of the real output variables (common <b>business</b> <b>cycles)</b> between the countries concerned are present. The present paper employs the Johansen (1988) cointegration test to check the long-run comovements of real outputs and also conducts the Vahid and Engle (1993) common feature test to detect the <b>short-term</b> common <b>business</b> <b>cycles.</b> The novelty of this paper is twofold. First, whereas the structural VAR approach considers shocks to correlation bilaterally, we use a multivariate VAR framework to allow for the relationships within a specific group of countries. Second, we employ the cointegration technique to examine both the longrun and the short-run dynamics of linkage of the real variables to determine the suitability and costs of forming a monetary union in the region. We include in this study Japan and the United States in addition to the nine East Asian economies including three Asian NIEs (Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong), ASEAN 5 (Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines), and Mainland China to investigate the co-movements of the real output variables spanning a period from 1978 Q 1 to 2006 Q 4. We first perform the Johansen (1988) cointegration test to check whether a group of countries concerned shares common stochastic trend(s), and then, conduct the Vahid and Engle (1993) common feature test to explore the existence of <b>short-term</b> common <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> among the countries if the real output series are cointegrated. This will allow the assessment of how the output variables among these countries interact in both the short-term and long-term within a multivariate framework. The cointegration results and the common feature tests will ensure <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> synchronization across the economies and determine the effectiveness of a common monetary policy to a union-wide shock. Based on a multivariate framework, this study will provide important implications for cost effectiveness in establishing a regional monetary union. The results of the Vahid and Engle (1993) common feature test indicate that there exists a linearly independent common feature vector, i. e., a linear independent combination of real output growth which has no correlation with the relevant past. This leads to the conclusion that besides the cointegrating relationship of real outputs, the concerned countries share common <b>short-term</b> <b>business</b> <b>cycles.</b> In particular, the results for the presence of one or two common feature vector(s) indicate the existence of synchronized common <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> in two groups: the first one includes the Asian NIEs that consists of Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, and the second one the ASEAN 5 plus Japan. These economies would be the good candidates for a monetary union as they share both long-run output co-movements as well as synchronized common <b>business</b> <b>cycles.</b> However, the results show that the United States and China are not suitable for a membership of the grouped economies, as do the ASEAN 5 and Japan...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} crisis in 2008 evidenced an over-simplification {{of the role}} of banks made in the majority of macroeconomic models. Based on Accounting System Dynamics (ASD) modeling approach, the current research presents a model that incorporates banks as creators of deposits when making loans as opposed to the conventional view of banks as intermediaries of existing money. The generic model thus developed consists of five sectors; production, household, banking, government and central bank to better understand interrelationships among five sectors and to explorer how monetary and production sector interact. The model turns out to produce diverse macroeconomic behaviors driven by interactions of reinforcing and balancing feedback loops. Some of them are: 1. Variability of money stock under stable base money due to endogenous deposit creation, 2. <b>Short-term</b> <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> triggered by two different sources, 3. Temporary alleviation of GDP gap by monetary easing policy and its limitation for counteracting deflationary trend, 4. Different macroeconomic effects induced by the same fiscal policy implemented under different economic conditions, 5. Macroeconomic instabilities triggered by credit crunches and a shock in currency holding ratio. Simulation experiments under different scenarios highlight the importance of building a macroeconomic model where banks supply the majority of money stock. We believe that this generic ASD macroeconomic model of the stock approach could provide a foundation for actual macroeconomic analyses based on historical economic data...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses a {{frequency}} domain approach to {{gain insight into}} the correlation between survey indicators and year-on-year GDP growth. Using the Baxter-King filter, we split up each series into three components: a <b>short-term,</b> a <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> (oscillations between 18 and 96 months) and a long-term component. We then calculate {{how much of the}} variation of the survey series and GDP growth can be ascribed to these different components. Finally, we use this information together with an analysis of the correlation between survey indicators and year-on-year GDP growth at the different frequencies to explain their overall correlation. We show that survey indicators, similar to year-on-year GDP growth, do not perfectly reflect <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> movements but contain cycles of other frequencies. Long-term cycles, in particular, are a nontrivial part of the series' variance. Furthermore, there exist some clear relations between the weight of these cycles in the survey indicators and their correlation with GDP growth. In general, the larger the <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> component, the larger the correlation, while the opposite is true for the short-term component. The evidence for the long-term component is mixed: although a long-term component seems necessary as the correlation at this frequency is the highest, strong or weak long-term components are typically idiosyncratic, dragging down the overall correlation between the indicator and year-on-year GDP growth. The paper applies this methodology to the euro area countries (EC survey indicators) and to Belgium separately (NBB business survey indicators). The results are highly comparabl...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{traditional}} industry-level profitability indicators {{for assessing the}} state of competition is problematic for two reasons. First, <b>short-term</b> variation reflects <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> more than it does the impact of competition policy. Second, rough industry-level indicators hide different mechanisms that are dependent on competition but may affect profitability in opposite directions. In this analysis both problems are avoided by using firm-level Financial Statement Statistics of Statistics Finland over the years 1995 - 2006 and by applying a decomposition method. With these tools the micro- level sources of industry-level profitability changes have been examined over a long-run period. The findings provide support to the general view having emerged from the earlier micro-level analysis that competition has developed in a favorable way in Finland {{until the end of}} the 1990 s. On the other hand, the results reveal interesting differences between periods, sectors and regions, which describe challenges of competition policy in the future...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} strategy. Making as practised by small professional football clubs. The study was undertaken because football clubs were perceived to have problems with strategy-making {{and because it was}} believed that the specific circumstances of football clubs could be outside the range of views covered by conventional views of strategy-making. The characteristics of the club environment are its uncertainty and unpredictability, simultaneous competition and co [...] operation, strong regulations, and a not-for-profit orientation. Small clubs in particular face a constant struggle for financial viability and survival, due in part to split business and playing objectives. The study was designed to establish the extent and nature of the difficulties clubs experience with a view to preparing the way for creating practical guidance on ways to overcome them. Clearly, in order to survive in the long term, small professional football clubs require very effective strategic decisions. This study has addressed this issue by inquiring into the nature of strategy making for these organisations with the objective to establish the general direction in which the football clubs in question should be moving. As a result, the main research question to guide this investigation was determined as: Why do small professional football clubs have difficulties making strategies. The investigation was based on an analysis the concept of strategy and its elements, the strategic vision and objectives, the process by which strategic action comes about, the strategic action itself, and the context within which this action occurs. Data has been collected, analysed and interpreted in relation to each of these elements. Together {{with a wide variety of}} published material, 20 small football clubs have been sampled and personal interviews were conducted with board members of those clubs. The findings indicate that small football clubs do indeed experience considerable difficulties in making strategies, the reasons for which lie both in the characteristics of their competitive environment and their approaches to strategy-making. The competitive environment is characterised by a cartel-like structure with a high degree of regulation, high levels of uncertainty, little control over the core product or the production process, <b>short-term</b> <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> and a close geographical link between a club with its local market. The management of clubs is characterised by the need to balance conflicting sporting and business objectives. Formal planning techniques are of little use in the small football club context as decision-making processes have a strong political character and the development of novel strategies is hindered by a strong conservative, industry paradigm and a lack of financial and managerial resources. It is concluded that there is no simple advice to be given to clubs, as they must re-examine the relationship between their playing and business objectives to create a unified and workable approach...|$|R

Finally, {{we find that the}} effect of trade on <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> synchronisation is not driven by outliers and does not suffer from parameter heterogeneity. <b>business</b> <b>cycles,</b> trade, synchronization of <b>business</b> <b>cycles...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the conformity of the European <b>business</b> <b>cycles.</b> While previous {{papers have}} {{searched for the}} existence of synchronous <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> in the euro-zone, this paper takes the synchronization as given and instead focuses on the growth pattern over the <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> and deepness of the <b>business</b> <b>cycles.</b> Three interesting results emerge: First, the growth pattern appears to be almost identical across countries {{with the exception of the}} UK and Denmark. Second, the <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> can best be characterized as consisting of two phases. Third, the deepness of the EU <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> appears to be homogenous across countries. This result challenges Friedman’s “ceiling hypothesis”...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{a freshly}} built data set and {{relying on a}} Bayesian Dynamic Factor Model, this paper {{constructs}} <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> indices for five South-East European (SEE) countries (Austria(-Hungary), Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Serbia/Yugoslavia) to address two questions: to what extent {{has there been a}} common SEE <b>business</b> <b>cycle,</b> and has there been synchronisation of <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> with England, France and Germany? We find limited but increasing <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> integration before World War I, both within SEE and vis-Ã -vis the core economies. The trend towards increasing levels of <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> synchronisation accelerates in the interwar period and is not even interrupted by the arrival of the Great Depression. The onset of the Cold War almost completely extinguishes regional <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> integration, but the reorientation of some communist countries towards the West (early on by Yugoslavia, from the mid- 1970 s also by Romania) also sees the re-emergence of a common <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> vis-Ã -vis Austria and Germany.

We {{employed}} tests devised by Bai and Perron (2003) to show that, for Taiwan’s <b>business</b> <b>cycle,</b> two breaks are present. In contrast, one break {{is revealed in}} the economic restructuring process in Korea. Moreover, the feature of <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> process across breaks is congruent with the real <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> theory...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{cyclical}} patterns by applying multivariate wavelet analysis. The wavelet covariance and wavelet correlation are defined {{and applied to}} the analysis of <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> {{as an alternative to the}} traditional cross-spectrum analysis. The main findings for Slovenia are that there is a significant <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> component in aggregate economic activity. <b>Business</b> <b>cycles</b> are asymmetric and highly synchronized with the EU cycle. Additionally we find that there are three distinctive periods of <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> synchronization, which have an important impact on the properties of a <b>business</b> <b>cycle...</b>|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{globalization}} and <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> in China and selected OECD countries using dynamic correlation analysis. We show that dynamic correlations of <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> of OECD countries and China are negative at business-cycle frequencies and positive for short-run developments. Furthermore, trade and financial flows of OECD countries and China reduce {{the degree of}} <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> synchronization within the OECD area, especially at business-cycle frequencies. Thus, different degrees of participation in globalization can explain {{the differences between the}} <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> of OECD countries.

40|$|Political <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> {{studies have}} arisen as {{alternatives}} to pure <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> studies. The {{studies in the}} political <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> area mainly try {{to answer the question}} that whether the voters are manipulated in election periods or not. Also, the methods which the politicians use to be re-elected are uncovered. In this paper, we ask the question whether there are opportunistic political <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> in Turkey or not. Our study focuses on the fiscal policies to discover the Turkish case. We use simple but powerful time series models in ARMA context to discover the relationships between political <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> and fiscal variables.
