Founded by Loi Ah Koon in 1944, Ya Kun remained a small family-run stall for decades, but have expanded rapidly since Loi's youngest son headed {{the business in}} 1999. They have over fifty outlets, mostly franchised, across six countries, and are a Singaporean cultural icon, known for their traditional brand identity and conservative, people-centric corporate culture.|$|E
5|$|Chastened by this experience, {{he agreed}} to submit to any {{procedure}} that would cure his appetite, and was treated with laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and <b>soft-boiled</b> <b>eggs.</b> The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} to scavenge for offal in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E
5|$|In July and August 2015 the {{restaurant}} was split in half, with one side serving brunch, lunch, and happy hour as the Palmetto Cafe. The 38-seat cafe's brunch menu included breakfast sandwiches, burritos, and pastries; its lunch menu included a fried green tomato sandwich with pimento cheese and coleslaw, po' boys, salads, and shrimp and grits. Fried chicken, kolaches, natchitoches meat pies, pimento cheeseburgers, seafood salads, and <b>soft-boiled</b> <b>eggs</b> were happy-hour menu items. In February 2016 the Palmetto was converted into a private event space and pop-up restaurant, and The Parish resumed serving lunch from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm on Fridays and Saturdays. The restaurant closed abruptly in September 2016, with little explanation.|$|E

5|$|Following this incident, Tarrare {{was desperate}} to avoid further {{military}} service, {{and returned to the}} hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite. Percy treated him with laudanum without success; further treatments with wine vinegar and tobacco pills were likewise unsuccessful. Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of <b>soft-boiled</b> <b>eggs,</b> but this also failed to suppress his appetite. Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in gutters, alleys and rubbish heaps. He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing bloodletting, and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary. Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a lunatic asylum, but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.|$|E
5|$|Ya Kun Kaya Toast {{have over}} forty Singaporean outlets, {{about half of}} which are franchised, and over thirty {{overseas}} outlets, all franchised, across seven countries (China, Indonesia, Japan, Myanmar, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines and United Arab Emirates); they plan to expand to Brunei, India, Malaysia, the Maldives, and Thailand in future. The stores have a retro ambience, with wooden tables and stools, Chinese calligraphy of the company name, posters about their history, traditional methods of preparing food and customer service reflecting Chinese family values. Unlike their main competitors, they have a limited menu that revolves around their core product, kaya toast, with cheese, peanut butter and ice cream as alternative spreads for their thin, brown, crispy bread. To appeal to a wider demographic, Ya Kun also sell French toast and Toastwiches (their Asian alternative to sandwiches); set meals combine any type of toast with <b>soft-boiled</b> <b>eggs</b> and a beverage, usually coffee or teh tarik.|$|E
25|$|Another Shabbat dish is calf's foot jelly, called p'tsha or šaltiena in Lithuania and galarita, galer, galleh, or fisnoge in Poland. Beef or calf {{bones are}} put up to boil with water, seasonings, garlic and onions {{for a long}} time. It is then allowed to cool. The broth then jells into a {{semi-solid}} mass, which is served in cubes. Drelies, a similar dish originating in south Russia and Galicia is mixed with <b>soft-boiled</b> <b>eggs</b> and vinegar when removed from the oven, and served hot. In Romania it is called piftie, in Serbia pihtije; it is served cold, with garlic, hard boiled eggs and vinegar sauce or mustard creme and considered a traditional dish in the winter season.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, a dish {{popular with}} {{children}} is a <b>soft-boiled</b> <b>egg</b> eaten with toast soldiers at breakfast. Strips of toast (the soldiers) are dipped into the runny yolk of a boiled egg through a hole made {{in the top of}} the eggshell, and eaten.|$|R
5000|$|Boiled {{eggs are}} eggs (typically chicken eggs) cooked with their shells unbroken, usually by [...] in boiling water.

500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "To the Blade", {{focuses on}} the death of Manchester-born aid worker Alan Henning at the hands of ISIL's [...] "Jihadi John".

And the fact that someone who did it was also from Britain, but this was being played out on a global scale... It seemed like the craziest thing I’d ever heard." [...] Other songs criticise political leaders in the United Kingdom. Higgs had been vocal of his distaste of politics in interviews following the release of Arc. Several critics suggest that [...] "The Wheel (Is Turning Now)" [...] is a commentary on the [...] "snake-oil appeal" [...] of then-UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage; Higgs told The Line of Best Fit that the song also comments on [...] "religious leaders and charismatic, corrupt leaders, or even men as gods". [...] "No Reptiles" [...] supposes that political leaders are [...] "just fat, bald, old men, like <b>soft-boiled</b> <b>eggs,</b> that are just weak-willed, with no strong feelings (good or ill)"; its lyrics also make cryptic reference to Elliot Rodger, who carried out the 2014 Isla Vista killings.|$|E

60|$|For {{right here}} {{occurred}} with Jerry {{a wonderful thing}} that thinkers {{of the world have}} not explained. He manifested in his dog's brain the free agency of life, by which all the generations of metaphysicians have postulated God, and by which all the deterministic philosophers have been led by the nose despite their clear denouncement of it as sheer illusion. What Jerry did he did. He did not know how or why he did it any more than does the philosopher know how or why he decides on mush and cream for breakfast instead of two <b>soft-boiled</b> <b>eggs.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 2012, Jill Turton ate at the {{restaurant}} for the Yorkshire Post following {{the restaurant}}'s fiftieth anniversary, and described some dishes, such as asparagus and a <b>soft-boiled</b> <b>egg</b> which had been cooked in a bain-marie, as [...] "perfect".

6000|$|Arriving in {{the breakfast}} room at half past seven, Graham found himself {{just in time}} to say good-by to the Gazette man and the Idaho buyer, who, finishing, were just ready to catch the ranch machine that {{connected}} at Eldorado with the morning train for San Francisco.

[...] Declining variously suggested breakfast foods, mushes, and porridges, Graham had just ordered his <b>soft-boiled</b> <b>eggs</b> and bacon, when Bert Wainwright drifted in with a casualness that Graham recognized as histrionic, when, five minutes later, in boudoir cap and delectable negligee, Ernestine Desten drifted in and expressed surprise at finding such a multitude of early risers.|$|E
60|$|I {{had had a}} sort of vague idea, don't you know, that if I stuck {{close to}} Motty and went about the place with him, I might act as a bit of a damper on the gaiety. What I mean is, I thought that if, when he was being the life and soul of the party, he were to catch my reproving eye he might ease up a trifle on the revelry. So the next night I took him along to supper with me. It was the last time. I'm a quiet, {{peaceful}} sort of chappie who has lived all his life in London, and I can't stand the pace these swift sportsmen from the rural districts set. What I mean to say is this, I'm all for rational enjoyment and so forth, but I think a chappie makes himself conspicuous when he throws <b>soft-boiled</b> <b>eggs</b> at the electric fan. And decent mirth and all that sort of thing are all right, but I do bar dancing on tables and having to dash all over the place dodging waiters, managers, and chuckers-out, just when you want to sit still and digest.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Soft-boiled</b> <b>eggs</b> are {{commonly}} served in egg cups, where {{the top of}} the egg is cut off with a knife, spoon, spring-loaded egg topper, or egg scissors, using a teaspoon to scoop the egg out.

[...] <b>Soft-boiled</b> <b>eggs</b> can be eaten with toast cut into strips, which are then dipped into the runny yolk. In the United Kingdom and Australia, these strips of toast are known as [...] "soldiers". Because the egg shell insulates heat in the unbroken section of the boiled egg (thus continuing to cook it), the yolk gradually solidifies, like a hard-boiled egg. A teaspoon is often used to scoop the cooked yolk and white out of the shell so it can be eaten.|$|E
