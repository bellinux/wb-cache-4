500|$|The {{first draft}} of the script portrayed Leslie and Mark as {{slightly}} less likable characters. Originally, Mark asked Ron to green-light the park project not to help Leslie, but because he was attracted to Ann and wanted another excuse to keep seeing her. These elements of the script were changed after press tours and focus group screenings. The show's writers spent time researching local California politics and attended Los Angeles City Council meetings. Daniels and Schur wanted the pilot to establish that one of Leslie's duties {{was talking to the}} public on a regular basis, and they deliberately portrayed her public forum meetings as poorly attended except by a select group of angry residents. Schur said, [...] "I've been to some community meetings in my life, and it is often this feeling of utter sparseness. That nobody cares." [...] In writing the script, Schur wanted Mark and Leslie to have a long history together before the events of the episode, rather than having the two characters meet {{for the first time on}} screen, which he felt had already been done in many television shows. The first shot of the pilot was originally a scene with Ann standing over the pit and <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> with an annoyed expression, followed by a documentary interview with Ann and Andy. The opening scene was changed because Daniels and Schur decided they wanted the first scene of the series to be set in a park. As a result, the episode started with a cold open of Leslie interviewing children in a park, then using a broom to push a drunk man out of spiral slide. Daniels had such a specific vision for the scene, he drew an elaborate and detailed storyboard sketch of a drunk man stuck in a tubular slide.|$|E
2500|$|Cliff Curtis as Searle, the ship's {{doctor and}} {{psychological}} officer. He {{is obsessed with}} the Sun and how it looks when <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> without any type of protection. The role of Searle was originally written to be a [...] "slightly stiff" [...] British character. Curtis {{was drawn to the}} role based on the script and also expressed interest in working with the director. Boyle was familiar with Curtis from Training Day (2001) and Whale Rider (2002), and Curtis's audition appealed to Boyle strongly enough to cast the actor as Searle. Curtis initially foresaw an esoteric approach for his character, but he later pursued a military and scientific approach based on the seriousness of the mission. The actor also compared Searle to the character of Pinbacker, noting their similarities and differences: [...] " [...] would sacrifice those beliefs and views, his life, for the greater good, whereas Pinbacker, who's come to a place he believes is right, would sacrifice the world for his beliefs. They're {{two sides of the same}} coin." ...|$|E

50|$|Jai Ho! Democracy, is a 2015 Indian comedy film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Ranjit Kapoor, who was also the dialogue writer of Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro and has been produced by Bikramjeet Bhullar of Indian Production House. It is a dark satire on Indian politics and takes a dig at the existing social and political morass India is <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> currently. <b>It</b> stars an ensemble cast that includes the likes of Om Puri, Annu Kapoor, Satish Kaushik, Adil Hussain and Seema Biswas.|$|R
5000|$|According to the [...] "Nishihari Kaidan Jikki (西播怪談実記)," [...] in September of one {{the years}} of Enpō, at night in Harima Province, {{somebody}} named Mizutani (水谷) brought along a dog to hunt in the mountain recesses, when he witnessed an ōnyūdō looking like a mountain <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him. <b>It</b> {{is said to be}} so large that it could straddle a mountain (several thousands of meters large). It was rumored to have been mountain god warning against the killing of life.|$|R

60|$|So Peter scampered over to {{the tall}} pine in which was Blacky's old nest. As he sat with his head tipped back, <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> it struck him that that nest didn't look so old, after all. In fact, {{it looked as if}} it had {{recently}} been fixed up quite like new. He was wondering about this and trying to guess what it meant, when Blacky himself alighted close to the edge of it.|$|R
5000|$|PRI's The World {{radio program}} covered the {{animation}} in a segment, {{in which they}} noted the clip's trance-inducing qualities. Patrick Macias, who was interviewed in the program, described the animation: This is basically a joke for someone who spends all of their time <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> a computer, made by people who spend all of their time <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> a computer. <b>It's</b> possible to read deeper meanings into it, but it sort of defeats the purpose because in the end it's just this hypnotic clip of animation.|$|R
6000|$|... "No--not long," [...] {{said the}} bishop and tried again {{to make his}} way between the back of the sofa and a heavy rector, who was <b>staring</b> over <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the grimaces of the signora.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, the Seer," [...] he replied, still <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> ruefully. [...] "I don't {{mind the}} five thou., but {{to think the}} fellow should have gammoned the pair of us like that--ignominious, I call it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{where every}} visitor can see them, I suppose," [...] lamented Cecily. [...] "He just worries my life out.

6000|$|Hiram {{stood for}} a while <b>staring</b> blankly <b>at</b> her. <b>It</b> was she who first spoke. [...] "Won't you let me come in, Hi?" [...] said she. [...] "I'm nigh starved with the cold and I'm fit to die, I'm so hungry. For God's sake, let me come in." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{recovered}} {{himself from}} a day dream. He {{became aware of}} a library attendant down the room leaning forward over his desk, gnawing {{the tip of a}} paper knife after the fashion of South Kensington library attendants, and <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him curiously. <b>It</b> occurred to Lewisham that thought reading {{was one of the most}} possible things in the world. He blushed, rose clumsily and took the volume of the Encyclopaedia back to its shelf.|$|R
6000|$|... "The devil it is!" [...] said Sir Richmond, turning round {{sharply and}} <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> {{as if he}} {{expected}} it to display some surprising and yet familiar features. Then he looked questioningly and suspiciously at his companion.|$|E
60|$|I {{crushed the}} letter in my hand, and sat <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> my pigsty in ruins about my ears, {{face to face with}} the fact that, even in a best of all {{possible}} worlds, money will not buy everything.|$|E
60|$|The Colonel stopped mechanically. Its {{unexpected}} appearance {{there had}} served {{to break the}} current of his meditations.

60|$|MURRAY. That's all right, then. I wouldn't trust {{any of that}} {{bunch of}} women. They'd be only too glad to squeal on you. (There is an uncomfortable pause.

60|$|As {{the man and}} the boy stood <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> each other, <b>it</b> {{would have}} been {{difficult}} to say which opened his eyes widest with amazement. At first Heywood fancied the urchin was a wild beast of some sort on two legs, but a second glance convinced him that he was a real boy. The next thought that occurred to the artist was, that he would try to sketch him, so he clapped his hand to his pocket, pulled out his book and pencil, and forthwith began to draw.|$|R
60|$|But {{there was}} no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain whom we {{expected}} to see. Instead we were faced by an object so strange and so unexpected that we stood for a moment <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> in amazement.|$|E

5000|$|The {{differences}} between rods and cones are useful; apart from enabling sight in both dim and light conditions, they have further advantages. The fovea, {{directly behind the}} lens, consists of mostly densely packed cone cells. The fovea gives humans a highly detailed central vision, allowing reading, bird watching, or any other task which primarily requires <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> things. <b>Its</b> requirement for high intensity light does cause problems for astronomers, as they cannot see dim stars, or other celestial objects, using central vision because the light from these {{is not enough to}} stimulate cone cells. Because cone cells are all that exist directly in the fovea, astronomers have to look at stars through the [...] "corner of their eyes" [...] (averted vision) where rods also exist, and where the light is sufficient to stimulate cells, allowing an individual to observe faint objects.|$|R
5000|$|Sometime in 1992, Parks {{approached}} a then-reclusive Wilson with {{the invitation to}} record an album together. Wilson {{was in the middle}} of a court-ordered removal and restraining order from his psychiatrist, which came as a result of years of over-medication and gross misconduct. According to Parks, [...] "The reason why I asked him was to take care of this unfinished business, and to try to escape from the tyranny of the sense of history that's been placed on our own aborted effort. Smile" [...] Later adding, [...] "When I found him, he was alone in a room <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> a television. <b>It</b> was off." ...|$|R
60|$|He darted some {{distance}} {{up along the}} bank and hovered for an instant close to the top. Peter scampered over there and looked up. There, just a few inches below the top, was another hole, a very much larger hole than those he had just left. As he was <b>staring</b> up <b>at</b> <b>it</b> a head with a long sharp bill and a crest which looked {{as if all the}} feathers {{on the top of his}} head had been brushed the wrong way, was thrust out. It was Rattles himself. He didn't seem at all glad to see Peter. In fact, he came out and darted at Peter angrily. Peter didn't wait to feel that sharp dagger-like bill. He took to his heels. He had seen what he started out to find and he was quite content to go home.|$|R
