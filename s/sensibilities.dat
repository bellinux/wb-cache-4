40|$|Introduction. Prolapse surgery {{has been}} shown to have major impact on sexual function. Since {{prolapse}} surgery not only influences psychological factors but might also influence physiological conditions such as vaginal innervation, {{there is a need for}} objective outcome measurements to better understand the effects of prolapse surgery on sexual function. Aims. To assess the effects of prolapse surgery with or without stress incontinence surgery on vaginal <b>sensibility</b> and to assess the relationship between vaginal wall <b>sensibility</b> and sexual well-being. Methods. This study was performed parallel to a randomized controlled trial comparing vaginal and abdominal prolapse surgery with or without incontinence surgery in women with uterine prolapse stage 2 or more. Main Outcome Measures. Vaginal wall <b>sensibility</b> was defined as mean sensation threshold to electrical stimulation of the vaginal wall at four standardized places, measured before and 6 months after surgery. Higher sensation thresholds postsurgery relative to presurgery indicate diminished vaginal wall <b>sensibility.</b> Sexual function was assessed at the same time points using a questionnaire. Results. Data on vaginal wall <b>sensibility</b> were obtained from 65 patients. The <b>sensibility</b> of the distal posterior (P = 0. 02) and distal anterior (P = 0. 10) vaginal wall decreased after vaginal surgery compared to abdominal surgery. Abdominal prolapse surgery with incontinence surgery decreased <b>sensibility</b> of the distal part of the anterior vaginal wall significantly more than abdominal prolapse surgery only (P = 0. 01). Before surgery, vaginal wall <b>sensibility</b> was lower in women who reported vaginal dryness or anorgasmia. The presence of genital pain was associated with higher vaginal wall <b>sensibility.</b> Postoperative vaginal wall <b>sensibility</b> was similar in women with and without sexual problems. Conclusion. Vaginal prolapse surgery as well as abdominal prolapse surgery with additional incontinence surgery resulted in decreased vaginal wall <b>sensibility.</b> This pilot study shows no influence of the decreased vaginal wall <b>sensibility</b> on sexual well-being. Larger studies are needed to better understand the association between changes in vaginal wall <b>sensibility</b> and changes in sexual well-being.

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} <b>sensibility</b> of the stump in adults with an {{acquired}} major upper extremity amputation with the <b>sensibility</b> of the unaffected side {{and with the}} corresponding body parts of healthy controls, {{as well as to}} relate the <b>sensibility</b> of the stump to daily functioning. Design: A survey with matched controls. Setting: A tertiary referral center. Participants: A referred sample of patients (n= 30) with an acquired upper extremity amputation, at least 1 year after amputation, and control subjects (n= 30) matched for age, sex, and hand dominance were evaluated. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Three different modalities of <b>sensibility</b> were measured: (1) touch-pressure <b>sensibility,</b> tested using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments; (2) stereognosis, detected using the Shape and Texture Identification test; and (3) kinesthesia. Daily functioning was assessed using the Upper Extremity Functional Status Module of the Orthotics and Prosthetics Users' Survey. Results: The mean time +/- SD since amputation was 20 +/- 17. 8 years. Twenty patients used a prosthesis. The stump <b>sensibility</b> was similar to that of unaffected hands and tended to be less than that of unaffected arms (P=. 08). The patients using a prosthesis had significantly poorer touch-pressure <b>sensibility</b> in the stump compared with the nonusers (P=. 04). However, touch-pressure <b>sensibility</b> and stereognosis were worse in the patients than in controls (P Conclusions: The touch-pressure <b>sensibility</b> in the stumps of patients using prostheses was poorer than the <b>sensibility</b> in nonusers, and' remarkably, the unaffected extremities of the amputees were less sensitive than the extremities of the controls.
