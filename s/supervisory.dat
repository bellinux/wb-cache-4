As with the prosecutor general, the State <b>Supervisory</b> Committee is appointed by the president.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 the newspaper's <b>supervisory</b> council hired {{school teacher}} Fredrik Monsen {{to be the}} new editor. Olav Larssen started his {{journalist}} career as a subeditor in the same year. In the newspaper's <b>supervisory</b> council vote, Monsen edged out Waldemar Carlsen with 22 to 4 votes, and also prevailed over other applicants who were seasoned editors, such as Ingvald Førre and Eugène Olaussen. Larssen prevailed over Carlsen and Førre in the vote for the new subeditor.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Justice was {{in charge}} of {{judicial}} and penal processes, but had no <b>supervisory</b> role over the Censorate or the Grand Court of Revision.|$|E
5|$|The {{effective}} {{scope of}} the principles of judicial review depends on how the Court chooses to exercise its discretion in pursuance of its <b>supervisory</b> jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|A promotional limited comic {{series was}} {{produced}} in the run up to the game's release. The comic was written by Robbie Morrison, and drawn by Sergio Sandoval and Trevor Hairsine. The cover art was handled by Murry, while both McMarle and Jacques-Belletête took <b>supervisory</b> roles for the story and artwork respectively. The comic was published by DC Comics between February 9 and June 20, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In late 2010, Spanish {{construction}} company Grupo ACS, which already owned a 30 percent stake of Hochtief, launched a bid {{that would allow}} ACS to acquire an additional 20 percent stake of Hochtief. The bid {{was approved by the}} German Federal Financial <b>Supervisory</b> Authority (BaFin) on 29 November 2010. ACS increased its stake in Hochtief to 50.16 percent in June 2011, effectively taking over control of Hochtief.|$|E
5|$|Section Six {{lists the}} office and duties of the {{prosecutor}} general (Procurator General in the official translation) and the State <b>Supervisory</b> Committee. The prosecutor general and his appointed assistant prosecutors are tasked with the balanced implementation of national, regional and local laws on all sectors of government and public society. The prosecutor general is appointed by the president with permission from the Council of the Republic.|$|E
5|$|The Mystic Seaport Light {{is subject}} to United States Coast Guard {{regulations}} to become operational, {{and because it is}} a full-sized replica of a lighthouse, requirements include <b>supervisory</b> schedules and installation of an emergency, backup light. This was not a financial priority for Mystic Seaport in 1967 and it was not made a fully functional lighthouse.|$|E
5|$|A {{supplementary}} {{member of}} the Storting, he met in the parliament once, acting as secretary for the constitution committee. During 1839–57, he was a {{member of the}} <b>supervisory</b> board of Norges Bank. He became a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 1821, and was its secretary from 1825 to 1831. Having a profound wish to spread erudition in Norway, he used his acquaintances in England to supply the society with enlightenment books and journals. Knudtzon eventually bequeathed his entire book collection and five of Thorvaldsen's sculptures to the society, with the condition that they not move to Christiania.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{failures}} of the ratings agencies, European regulators obtained new powers to supervise ratings agencies. With the creation of the European <b>Supervisory</b> Authority in January 2011 the EU set up a whole range of new financial regulatory institutions, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which became the EU's single credit-ratings firm regulator. Credit-ratings companies have to comply with the new standards or will be denied operation on EU territory, says ESMA Chief Steven Maijoor.|$|E
5|$|Equal {{protection}} {{may have}} seemed inapt to the litigants or to the Court for a case of sex discrimination in 1942, or it {{may have seemed}} inapt for a case of cross-group challenge. The Sixth Amendment was not again invoked by the Supreme Court against jury discrimination for thirty years; the Sixth Amendment did not (yet) apply to state juries, and in federal cases the Court seemed to prefer its <b>supervisory</b> power over lower federal courts.|$|E
5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in this regard. First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The Financial <b>Supervisory</b> Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E
5|$|In February 1996, Bisceglie {{provided}} {{a copy of}} the 1971 essay written by Ted Kaczynski to the FBI. At the UNABOM Task Force headquarters in San Francisco, <b>Supervisory</b> Special Agent Joel Moss immediately recognized similarities in the writings. Linguistic analysis determined that the author of the essay papers and the manifesto were almost certainly the same. When combined with facts gleaned from the bombings and Kaczynski's life, that analysis provided the basis for a search warrant.|$|E
5|$|One of Harrison's first acts as {{president}} was {{to implement a}} new training program for college graduates hired by the company. Rather than being placed in <b>supervisory</b> roles, they were given regular entry-level jobs in the engine shops and on the building and repairing of railroad track, {{to give them an}} understanding of the basics of the railroad business. He also instituted a remedial education program for the regular workforce; they were trained in mathematics and other subjects to high school level, as well as in engine and machine-shop basics. The program was designed to help train new supervisors in the skills needed to oversee other workers.|$|E
5|$|Phua {{joined the}} ruling PAP's Jalan Besar branch in 2004. The {{following}} year, she {{was appointed to}} the Feedback <b>Supervisory</b> Panel, which leads the government's Feedback Unit. In the 2006 general election, she was fielded as a PAP candidate in Jalan Besar GRC, which was contested by the Singapore Democratic Alliance. During the election campaign, she promised to make Singapore a more inclusive society by representing the disabled and special needs communities. The PAP team won Jalan Besar GRC with 69.26% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|The Commissioner of Mining for Svalbard {{is part of}} the Norwegian Directorate of Mining, but {{retains its}} own offices in Longyearbyen. The {{commissioner}} is responsible for administrating mineral rights, both for mining and petroleum. Other public agencies which have <b>supervisory</b> roles, but are not stationed on Svalbard, are the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the Norwegian Directorate for Fire and Explosion Prevention and the Norwegian Directorate for Product and Electrical Safety.|$|E
5|$|The Gore letter did spur some {{progress}} in negotiations, as the Soviet Union allowed in late November 1958 for explicit control measures {{to be included}} in the text of the drafted treaty. By March 1959, the negotiators had agreed upon seven treaty articles, but they primarily concerned uncontroversial issues and a number of disputes over verification persisted. First, the Soviet verification proposal was deemed by the West to be too reliant on self-inspection, with control posts primarily staffed by citizens of the country housing the posts and a minimal role for officials from the international <b>supervisory</b> body. The West insisted that half of a control post staff be drawn from another nuclear state and half from neutral parties. Second, the Soviet Union required that the international <b>supervisory</b> body, the Control Commission, require unanimity before acting; the West rejected the idea of giving Moscow a veto over the Commission's proceedings. Finally, the Soviet Union preferred temporary inspection teams drawn from citizens of the country under inspection, while the West insisted on permanent teams composed of inspectors from the Control Commission.|$|E
5|$|The entire metro {{system and}} the trains are run by a fully {{automated}} computer system, located at the Control and Maintenance Center south of Vestamager Station. The automatic train control (ATC) consists of three subsystems: automatic train protection (ATP), automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train <b>supervisory</b> (ATS). The ATP is responsible for keeping the trains' speed, ensuring that doors are closed before departure and switches are correctly set. The system uses fixed block signaling, except around stations, where moving block signaling is used.|$|E
5|$|The process {{requires}} the regulator to directly link a robust risk assessment to a suggested regulatory response (e.g. financial penalties, criminal imprisonment). Regulatory risk differentiation is {{also referred to}} as the Compliance Model in some regulatory agencies. See for example the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority risk differentiation approach known as: PAIRS / SOARS. PAIRS is the Probability And Impact Rating System, while SOARS is the <b>Supervisory</b> Oversight And Response System.|$|E
5|$|Youngstown's finance {{department}} oversees all municipal finances and supervises {{the departments of}} economic development and income tax. The city's department of public works has sweeping <b>supervisory</b> responsibilities and oversees the departments of engineering, building inspection, building and grounds, signal and sign, demolition and housing, litter and recycling, street, and water waste treatment. The city's law department represents the city on all legal issues, serving as counsel to all municipal departments.|$|E
5|$|Briefly {{a member}} of the {{conservative}} Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), Blažeković was imprisoned several times by the Yugoslav authorities because of his involvement with various Croatian youth organizations which saw him often involved in clashes with left-wing students. He joined the far-right Ustaše in 1939, and following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and the establishment of the Ustaše-led NDH in April 1941, went on to be appointed to the newly formed Ustaše <b>supervisory</b> committee by Slavko Kvaternik. That same month he also became the leader of the Ustaše University Headquarters and the Ustaše Youth, charged with organizing student bodies at the University of Zagreb and promoting Ustaše's policy of preventing all non-Croats from attending universities in the country.|$|E
5|$|Exclusion of {{judicial}} review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect the exercise of executive power. Typically, this has been done though the insertion of finality or total ouster clauses into Acts of Parliament, or by wording powers conferred by Acts on decision-makers subjectively. Finality clauses are generally viewed restrictively by courts in the United Kingdom. The courts there have taken the view that such clauses are, subject to some exceptions, not effective in denying or restricting {{the extent to which}} the courts are able to exercise judicial review. In contrast, Singapore cases suggest that ouster clauses cannot prevent the High Court from exercising <b>supervisory</b> jurisdiction over the exercise of executive power where authorities have committed jurisdictional errors of law, but are effective against non-jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E
5|$|Feit did {{not feel}} {{comfortable}} with the monastic lifestyle at Assumption Abbey. He was sent to Jemez Springs, New Mexico, to a treatment retreat for troubled priests run by the Servants of the Paraclete. Feit joined the order as a staff member and worked his way into a <b>supervisory</b> role at the center. Father James Porter came to the center after {{he was known to}} have begun molesting children in the 1960s, and Feit cleared him for placement in another parish. Porter was later defrocked and imprisoned after abusing as many as 100 children. Feit left the priesthood in the 1970s. He got married, moved to the Phoenix area, and had three children. He worked at the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul as a food charity volunteer for 17 years.|$|E
5|$|Following the Constitution of May 3, 1791, the senate's competences were altered; in {{most cases}} the {{senators}} could only vote together with the sejm, and the senate's veto powers were limited. Legislative power was limited to the deputies of the sejm (not senators voting separately, except on the senate's privilege of veto, a suspension of a given legislation until the sejm votes on it again during the next session). The king, who nominated senators, ministers and other officials, presided over the senate, and could propose new laws together with the executive government, over which he also presided (the newly created Straż Praw or the Guardianship of Laws). The sejm also had the <b>supervisory</b> role, as government ministers and other officials were to be responsible to it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, 1923, the Labour Party {{broke out of}} the Comintern. Subsequently the Communist Party {{broke away from the}} Labour Party. The local chapter of the Labour Party in Hamar decided to side with the Communist Party in November 1923, in a 123–22 vote. Arbeideren was then taken away from Labour, as the <b>supervisory</b> council decided by a 65 to 5 vote that it should follow the Communists. Arbeideren was one of {{thirteen}} Labour newspapers that broke away from the party and followed the Communists (one, Nordlys, later returned to Labour). Since 15 February 1924 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad, as the Communist Party had seen fit to merge Arbeideren with Lillehammer-based Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad.|$|E
5|$|The {{remedies}} {{available in}} Singapore administrative law are the prerogative orders – the mandatory order (formerly known as mandamus), prohibiting order (prohibition), quashing order (certiorari), and order for review of detention (habeas corpus) – and the declaration, {{a form of}} equitable remedy. In Singapore, administrative law is the branch of law that enables a person to challenge an exercise of power by {{the executive branch of}} the Government. The challenge is carried out by applying to the High Court for judicial review. The Court's power to review a law or an official act of a government official is part of its <b>supervisory</b> jurisdiction, and at its fullest may involve quashing an action or decision and ordering that it be redone or remade.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{two-tier system}} the SE is managed by a {{management}} board. The member {{or members of}} the management board {{have the power to}} represent the company in dealings with third parties and in legal proceedings. They are appointed and removed by the <b>supervisory</b> board. No person may be a member of both the management board and the <b>supervisory</b> board of the same company at the same time. But the <b>supervisory</b> board may appoint one of its members to exercise the functions of a member of the management board in the event of absence through holidays. During such a period the function of the person concerned {{as a member of the}} <b>supervisory</b> board shall be suspended.|$|E
25|$|On 4 November 2014 the European Central Bank {{formally}} took <b>supervisory</b> {{control over}} the biggest banks in Europe, including those in Ireland. While banking supervision staff in the Central Bank of Ireland remained, a pan-European approach to how banks were supervised was introduced, the Single <b>Supervisory</b> Mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The {{inability}} or unwillingness of the Bank Board and {{its legal}} and <b>supervisory</b> staff {{to deal with}} problem institutions in a timely manner.
