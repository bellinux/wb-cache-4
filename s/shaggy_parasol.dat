50|$|Butterflies {{including}} Speckled Wood, Fungi including Jew's ear, Stag's {{horn and}} <b>Shaggy</b> <b>Parasol</b> and two nationally rare beetles: Magdalis barbicornis and Kissophagus hederae {{have been identified}} in the park.|$|E
50|$|The <b>shaggy</b> <b>parasol</b> is popularly praised as {{a choice}} edible mushroom. However, it {{contains}} toxins {{which can cause}} gastric upsets when eaten raw or undercooked, and some individuals show a strong allergic response even after cooking.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Shaggy</b> <b>parasol</b> is {{the common}} name for three closely related species of mushroom, Chlorophyllum rhacodes (or rachodes), C. olivieri and C. brunneum, found in North America, Europe and Southern Africa (the latter species {{is also found in}} Australia).|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, young <b>shaggy</b> <b>parasols</b> look {{identical}} to the poisonous Chlorophyllum molybdites (the mushroom that causes the most poisonings in North America yearly). Checking the spore print is essential as C. molybdites' [...] print is green (older specimens have slightly green gills). As a result, this mushroom is not recommended for inexperienced hunters.|$|R
50|$|Smaller but {{similar in}} {{appearance}} {{is the common}} <b>shaggy</b> <b>parasol</b> (Chlorophyllum rhacodes.) Its edibility is suspect as it causes mild sickness in some people, especially when eaten raw. One must learn to distinguish the two as their geographical ranges overlap.|$|E
50|$|The <b>shaggy</b> <b>parasol</b> {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the similarly edible parasol mushroom, Macrolepiota procera. The latter grows considerably larger however, and {{is more likely to}} be found in the open than C. rhacodes which prefers more shade and dislikes open pastures and fields. Another distinguishing feature is that C. rhacodes lacks the brown bands that are on the stem of M. procera.|$|E
50|$|The <b>shaggy</b> <b>parasol</b> is a {{large and}} {{conspicuous}} agaric, with thick brown scales and protuberances on its fleshy white cap. The gills and spore print are both white in colour. Its stipe is slender, but bulbous at the base, is coloured uniformly and bears no patterns. It is fleshy, and a reddish, or maroon discoloration occurs and a pungent odour is evolved when it is cut. The egg-shaped caps become wider and flatter as they mature.|$|E
50|$|Chlorophyllum molybdites, {{which has}} the common names of false parasol, green-spored parasol and vomiter, is a {{widespread}} mushroom. Highly poisonous and producing severe gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, it is commonly confused with the <b>shaggy</b> <b>parasol</b> or shaggy mane, and is the most commonly consumed poisonous mushroom in North America. Its large imposing appearance and similarity to the edible parasol mushroom, {{as well as its}} habit of growing in areas near human habitation, are reasons cited for this. The nature of the poisoning is predominantly gastrointestinal.|$|E
50|$|Chlorophyllum is a genus {{of large}} agarics similar in {{appearance}} {{to the true}} parasol mushroom. Chlorophyllum was originally coined in 1898, a time when spore color was the deciding factor for differentiating genera. It was termed in order to describe the poisonous green-spored C. molybdites which shared many characteristics of the mushrooms within the genus Lepiota but lacked the all important white spores. The name comes from Greek Chloro meaning green and phyll meaning leaves or gills. It remained as a genus of one lonely member until recently when modern DNA analyses concluded {{that many of the}} mushrooms contained in the genus Macrolepiota actually had more in common genetically with the Chlorophyllum molybdites than with {{the other members of the}} Macrolepiota. The genus has a widespread distribution, with many species found in tropical regions. The best known members are the edible <b>shaggy</b> <b>parasol,</b> a name applied to three very similar species Chlorophyllum rhacodes, C. olivieri and C. brunneum, and the poisonous C. molybdites, which is widespread in subtropical regions around the world.|$|E
50|$|The North Seattle College Wetlands {{sit at the}} South Fork of Thornton Creek and are {{important}} ecological lands for the Thornton Creek watershed as they work as a sponge to hold surge flows of water as well as filtering out pollutants. The wetlands serve as a critical habitat for many species including the Pacific Tree Frog and Long-toed salamander, {{as well as several}} species of avian and plant life.Currently, there is a system of crude trails that get you to and through most of the wetlands habitat. The main trail is a loop that walks around the northern part of campus. There are spurs that branch off of this main loop trail. An interpretive trail is in progress and a map is available with points of interest for those wishing to explore the wetlands further.A wide variety of native and non-native plant species can be observed throughout the main campus and surrounding wetlands habitat.There are many mushrooms growing in and around the wetlands. Some notable species include Redlead Roundhead (Stropharia aurantiaca), Harefoot Mushroom (Coprinopsis lagopus), Fiber Caps (Inocybe mixtilis), <b>Shaggy</b> <b>Parasol</b> (Chlorophyllum olvieri), and Bellybutton Hedgehog (Hydnum umbilicatum).Wetlands shrub life includes Snowberry Shrubs (Symphoricarpos albus), Himalayan Blackberry (Rubus discolor), Burning Bush (Eunonymus alatus), and Nootka Rose (Rosa Nutkana). Campus and wetlands are also home to many plants such as Sumac (Rhus Species), Yarrow (Achillea millefolium), Sword Fern (Polystichum munitum), and Common Horsetail (Equisetum arvense).|$|E
