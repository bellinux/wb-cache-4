5|$|A {{majority}} of <b>spiral</b> galaxies, including our own Milky Way galaxy, have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward {{to either side}} of the core, then merges into the <b>spiral</b> arm structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an SB, followed by a lower-case letter (a, b or c) that indicates the form of the <b>spiral</b> arms (in the same manner as the categorization of normal <b>spiral</b> galaxies). Bars are thought to be temporary structures that can occur {{as a result of a}} density wave radiating outward from the core, or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy. Many barred <b>spiral</b> galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.|$|E
5|$|A <b>spiral</b> {{galaxy is}} {{organized}} into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or {{bar at the}} center, and trailing bright arms that <b>spiral</b> outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. <b>Spiral</b> galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the Milky Way {{and one of our}} nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are <b>spiral</b> galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Coma Berenices {{contains}} the northern {{portion of the}} Virgo Cluster (also known as the Coma–Virgo Cluster), about 60 million light-years away. The portion includes five Messier galaxies. M85 (NGC 4382), considered elliptical or lenticular, {{is one of the}} cluster's brighter members at magnitude nine. M85 is interacting with the <b>spiral</b> galaxy NGC 4394 and the elliptical galaxy MCG-3-32-38. M88 (NGC 4501) is a multi-arm <b>spiral</b> galaxy seen at about 30° from edge-on. It has a highly-regular shape with well-developed, symmetrical arms. Among the first galaxies recognized as <b>spiral,</b> it has a supermassive black hole in its center. M91 (NGC 4548), a barred <b>spiral</b> galaxy with a bright, diffuse nucleus, is the faintest object in Messier's catalog at magnitude 10.2. M98 (NGC 4192), a bright, elongated <b>spiral</b> galaxy seen nearly edge-on, appears elliptical because of its unusual angle. The magnitude-10 galaxy has no redshift. M99 (NGC 4254) is a <b>spiral</b> galaxy seen face-on. Like M98 it is of magnitude-10 and has an unusually long arm on its west side. M100 (NGC 4321), a magnitude-nine <b>spiral</b> galaxy seen face-on, is one of the cluster's brightest. Photographs reveal a brilliant core, two prominent <b>spiral</b> arms, an array of secondary arms and several dust lanes.|$|E

5|$|<b>Spiral</b> galaxies {{consist of}} a {{rotating}} disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, <b>spiral</b> galaxies are listed as type S, followed by a letter (a, b, or c) that indicates the degree of tightness of the <b>spiral</b> arms {{and the size of}} the central bulge. An Sa galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At the other extreme, an Sc galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small core region. A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a flocculent <b>spiral</b> galaxy; in contrast to the grand design <b>spiral</b> galaxy that has prominent and well-defined <b>spiral</b> arms. The speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with the flatness of the disc as some <b>spiral</b> galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A recent {{analysis}} of the IRAS database indicates that the massive star formation rates in early-type (Sa-Sab) <b>spirals</b> are comparable to the massive star formation rates in late-type <b>spirals.</b> Hα imaging {{of some of the}} infrared luminous early-type <b>spirals</b> reveals two types of galaxies. One type shows clear signs of interaction, whereas the other type appears to host a nuclear starburst. The occurence of nuclear starbursts in early-type <b>spirals</b> {{may be related to the}} propensity for such galaxies to also host Seyfert nuclei. The evidence for interactions suggests that early-type <b>spirals</b> are evolving in the current epoch...|$|R
