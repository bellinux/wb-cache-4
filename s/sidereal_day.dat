25|$|The {{expectation}} {{was that}} the effect would be graphable as a sine wave with two peaks and two troughs per rotation of the device. This result could have been expected because during each full rotation, each arm would be parallel to the wind twice (facing into {{and away from the}} wind giving identical readings) and perpendicular to the wind twice.

While they were searching for scintillation of radio signals of quasars, they observed pulses which repeated with a period of 1.3373 seconds. Terrestrial origin of the signal was ruled out because {{the time it took}} the object to reappear was a <b>sidereal</b> <b>day</b> instead of a solar day.

25|$|In {{the case}} of planets {{orbiting}} in the CHZs of red dwarf stars, the extremely close distances to the stars cause tidal locking, {{an important factor in}} habitability. For a tidally locked planet, the <b>sidereal</b> <b>day</b> is as long as the orbital period, causing one side to permanently face the host star and the other side to face away. In the past, such tidal locking was thought to cause extreme heat on the star-facing side and bitter cold on the opposite side, making many red dwarf planets uninhabitable; however, three-dimensional climate models in 2013, showed that the side of a red dwarf planet facing the host star could have extensive cloud cover, increasing its bond albedo and reducing significantly temperature differences between the two sides.|$|E
25|$|Satellites Radiosat 1 through Radiosat 3 fly in {{geosynchronous}} (not geostationary) Tundra orbits. Like the geostationary orbit, {{the tundra}} orbit has {{a period of}} 23 hours, 56 minutes (one <b>sidereal</b> <b>day).</b> Unlike the geostationary orbit, the tundra orbit is elliptical, not circular, and is inclined {{with respect to the}} equator rather than orbiting directly over it. The eccentric orbit ensures that each satellite spends about 16 hours of each day high over the continental United States. At least one satellite is always visible, with another often visible as well. The orbit's high inclination places apogee just west of Hudson Bay in Canada, providing a much higher elevation angle for most of the country than is possible from a geostationary orbit. This reduces blockage from tall buildings in urban areas, allowing a much smaller terrestrial repeater network than does sister network XM, which uses geostationary orbits.|$|E

500|$|All {{the planets}} in the Solar System orbit the Sun in an {{anti-clockwise}} direction as viewed from above Earth's north pole. Most planets also rotate on their axes in an anti-clockwise direction, but Venus rotates clockwise in retrograde rotation once every 243 Earth days—the slowest rotation of any planet. Because its rotation is so slow, Venus {{is very close}} to spherical. A Venusian <b>sidereal</b> <b>day</b> thus lasts longer than a Venusian year (243 versus 224.7 Earth days). Venus's equator rotates at , whereas Earth's rotates at [...] Venus's rotation has slowed down in the 16years between the Magellan spacecraft and Venus Express visits; each Venusian <b>sidereal</b> <b>day</b> has increased by 6.5minutes in that time span. Because of the retrograde rotation, the length of a solar day on Venus is significantly shorter than the <b>sidereal</b> <b>day,</b> at 116.75Earthdays (making the Venusian solar day shorter than Mercury's 176Earthdays). One Venusian year is about 1.92Venusian solar days. To an observer on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east, although Venus's opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun from the planet's surface.|$|E
500|$|Because Earth {{takes one}} year to orbit the Sun, the {{apparent}} position of the Sun takes {{one year to}} make a complete circuit of the ecliptic. With slightly more than 365 days in one year, the Sun moves {{a little less than}} 1° eastward every day. This small difference in the Sun's position against the stars causes any particular spot on Earth's surface to catch up with (and stand directly north or south of) the Sun about four minutes later each day than it would if Earth would not orbit; a day on Earth is therefore 24 hours long rather than the approximately 23-hour 56-minute <b>sidereal</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
30|$|Currently, {{the exact}} {{magnitude}} of the FCN period change is unknown. SG observation results are not suitable for reference due to the aforementioned issue. The FCN period determined from VLBI varies {{on the order of}} 3 SDs after correcting the geophysical effects with atmospheric and oceanic EAMFs. However, there are some problems with this correction, especially with the oceanic effect, as mentioned in “Introduction” section. Thus, in general, the {{magnitude of the}} FCN period change could be a few <b>sidereal</b> <b>days,</b> considering some uncertainties.|$|R

30|$|An {{additional}} difference regarding satellite footprints is {{the repetition}} frequency of each footprint. For the GPS, the satellite constellation repeats approximately every 12 sidereal hours, {{which means that}} the footprint repeats with the same period [24] and each satellite will illuminate the same area every orbit. However, for GLONASS, the satellite constellation repeats approximately every 8 <b>sidereal</b> <b>days.</b> Thus, the combined use of GPS and GLONASS gives both a better temporal resolution (more sea level observations per time unit) and spatial resolution (better sea surface coverage per time unit) than each system alone.|$|R
500|$|Aside {{from the}} very surface layers, the {{atmosphere}} {{is in a state}} of vigorous circulation. The upper layer of troposphere exhibits a phenomenon of super-rotation, in which the atmosphere circles the planet in just four Earth days, much faster than the planet's <b>sidereal</b> <b>day</b> of 243 days. The winds supporting super-rotation blow at a speed of 100m/s (~360km/h or 220mph) or more. [...] Winds move at up to 60 times the speed of the planet's rotation, while Earth's fastest winds are only 10% to 20% rotation speed. On the other hand, the wind speed becomes increasingly slower as the elevation from the surface decreases, with the breeze barely reaching the speed of 10km/h (2.8m/s) on the surface. Near the poles are anticyclonic structures called polar vortices. Each vortex is double-eyed and shows a characteristic S-shaped pattern of clouds. Above there is an intermediate layer of mesosphere which separates the troposphere from the thermosphere. The thermosphere is also characterized by strong circulation, but very different in its nature - the gases heated and partially ionized by sunlight in the sunlit hemisphere migrate to the dark hemisphere where they recombine and downwell.|$|E

40|$|The {{two stars}} {{that form the}} subject of this paper are both short-period double-lined eclipsing binaries. They have non-circular orbits despite their short periods, both of which are very close to {{integral}} numbers of <b>sidereal</b> <b>days</b> (10. 0015 and 9. 0127 <b>sidereal</b> <b>days</b> respectively), making it difficult to achieve uniform phase coverage of the orbits from a single site in the short term. Although the HD type of HD 152028 is G 0, the integrated spectral type of the system must actually be much earlier: the (B − V) colour index is only about 0 m. 37 and the Hipparcos parallax indicates an integrated absolute magnitude as bright as + 1 m. 4. A published photometric investigation suggests that the primary star exhibits δ Scuti pulsations, with a period of 0. 1138 days. That period is not present in the radial velocities, but we have identified a comparable periodicity in the initially excessive residuals (σ ∼ 2 km s – 1) in the radial velocities of the primary star: there is an asymmetrical pulsational velocity curve with a semi-amplitude of ∼ 3 km s – 1 and a period of 0. 1178 days. The disagreement between that period and the published photometric one is probably because the latter is mistaken. It is argued from the luminosity of the system, the eclipse light-curves in V an...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. From the {{analysis}} of VLBI observational data compiled by USNO (U. S. Naval Observatory) from MJD 44089. 994 to 51618. 250 (Mc-Carthy, 2000), we showed that a strong peak around 400 <b>sidereal</b> <b>days</b> in the spectrum of its dierences from the IERS 96 nutation theory {{could be explained by}} adding a model Free Core Nutation (FCN) term {{in the form of a}} single damped oscillation. Then we developed a new analytical theory of the nonrigid-Earth nutation including the derived FCN model. We adopted RDAN 98 (Roosbeek and Dehant, 1998) as the rigid Earth nu-tation theory. It was convolved with a transfer function using numerical convolution in the time domain (Shirai and Fukushima, 2000). The form of the transfer function was the same as that of Herring (1995). How-ever, its free parameters such as the complex amplitude and frequency of the FCN were readjusted by tting to the above VLBI data. Even after truncating the forced nutation series so as to contain only 180 terms, the WRMS (Weighted Root Mean Square) of the complex residuals for the new nutation series is 0. 312 mas, which is signicantly smaller than 0. 325 mas, that of the IERS 96 nutation theory. As for the FCN term, we esti-mated its oscillatory period as 430 : 80 : 6 <b>sidereal</b> <b>days,</b> and its Q-value as 16200 1600.
