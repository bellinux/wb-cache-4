50|$|Some of the {{additional}} features (usually offered by banks) are as follows. Some DPs offer a frequent-trader account, where they charge frequent traders at lower rates than the <b>standard</b> <b>charges.</b> Demat account holders are generally required to pay the DP an advance fee for each account that will be adjusted against the various service charges. The account holder needs to raise the balance when it falls below a certain amount prescribed by the DP. However, if the holders also hold a savings account with the DP, they can provide a debit authorisation to the DP for paying this charge. Finally, once choosing a DP, it would be prudent to keep all accounts with that DP, so that tracking of capital gains liability is easier. This is because when calculating capital gains tax, the period of holding {{will be determined by}} the DP, and different DPs follow different methods. For instance, ICICI Bank uses the first in first out (FIFO) method to compute the period of holding. The proof of the cost of acquisition will be the contract note. The computation of capital gains is done account-wise.|$|E
5000|$|The {{economic}} {{position of}} lap dancers, as {{employees of the}} clubs, has also changed. Over time, most strip clubs have stopped paying the dancers. Stage dancing became a showcase to advertise {{the bodies of the}} dancers, whose money came from the tips or <b>standard</b> <b>charges,</b> depending on the club, that the patrons gave them for lap dancing. In the majority of clubs, dancers are simply charged a percentage of their nightly takings. However, the latest development in many countries, including Great Britain, the United States and Canada, is that many clubs charge dancers a [...] "stage fee" [...] or [...] "tip-out", which is an amount that a dancer needs to pay a club (usually in advance) in order to work on a given night, per shift. Given that dancers are basically paying for the privilege to be at a club, some clubs allow as many dancers as possible to appear on any given night, increasing competition among the dancers. Also, the vast majority of clubs will not waive this charge if a night happens to be slow. Consequently, the dancer either leaves her shift without any profit or builds a debt to the club.|$|E

Incorporating experience from the Battle of Jutland, the Mk II mounting had a maximum elevation of 30°, thus increasing the maximum range. In the 1930s a modification of the Mk I mounting, designated the Mk I (N), was introduced for use in those capital ships that were completely reconstructed. The Mk I (N) mounting also increased the maximum elevation from 20° to 30°. Maximum range in shipboard mountings was 33,550 yards (30,680 m) (30° elevation). During World War II older battleships with gun elevation limited to 20° were supplied with supercharges to increase their maximum range to 29,930 yards (27,370 m) at 2638 ft/s (804 m/s) using the Mk XVIIB or Mk XXII projectile, while HMS Vanguard could theoretically range to 37,870 yards (34,630 m) while using supercharges at a gun elevation of 30°.

Eighty-seven faculty members protested against the murals, and in 1901 a public prosecutor was called in and the issue even reached the Parliament of Austria, {{the first time that}} a cultural debate had ever been raised there, but in the end no action was taken. Only the education minister defended Klimt, and when Klimt was elected to be a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in 1901 the government refused to ratify the action. He was never offered another teaching position. This would also be the last time Klimt would accept commissions from the state, remarking: [...] "I've had enough of censorship...I reject all state support, I don't want any of it."A later painting of his entitled Goldfish (to my critics) (1901-1902) [...] which showed a smiling, beautiful woman projecting her bottom at the viewer, was an obvious response to all those who attacked the 'pornography' and 'perverted excess' of the University paintings.|$|E

This wire-wound gun fired a 1938 lb (879 kg) Mk XVIIB shell at a muzzle velocity of 2,458 ft/s (749 m/s).2 Maximum range in shipboard mountings was 33,550 yards (30,680 m) (30 degrees elevation).2 During World War II older battleships with gun elevation limited to 20 degrees were supplied with supercharges to increase their maximum range to 29,930 yards (27,370 m) at 2638 ft/s (804 m/s) using the Mk XVIII or Mk XXII projectile, while HMS Vanguard could range to 37,870 yards (34,630 m) while using supercharges at a gun elevation of 30 degrees.2 Coastal artillery mountings with higher elevations could reach 44,150 yards (40,370 m).

40|$|Background and Purpose-The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the current direct costs of modern management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in the first year after diagnosis. Methods-During a 1 -year period, we studied all admitted patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage from a population of 2 million people. We calculated the direct costs of treatment, which included the costs of medical and nursing care and the related travel expenses of patients. We calculated true costs for all major healthcare resources. National census data, if available, and <b>standard</b> <b>charges</b> were used to determine healthcare resource expenses. Results-Hospital admissions and diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in 110 patients accounted for 85 % of all costs; 64 % of the total direct medical costs during admission were the medical, nursing, and overhead costs alone. Patients discharged directly to home, generated 4 % of the total budget, whereas admission to a nursing home accounted for the remaining 11 % of the total costs. Of the diagnostic and therapeutic costs, 45 % was caused by imaging and 42 % by surgery or coiling. Angiography alone accounted for 52 % of the total imaging costs and 24 % of the total diagnostic and therapeutic costs. Prescribed medication accounted for only 3 % of the total budget of diagnostic and therapeutic costs. Conclusions-Most direct costs during the first year after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage are caused by the hospital inpatient days, accounting for two thirds of the total costs generated during the first year after the initial bleeding. If new costly treatments succeed in reducing the average length of inpatient hospital stays, then progress in therapy may prove cost effective and might even be cost savin...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Although {{national}} guidelines {{have been}} published {{for the management of}} critically injured traumatic cardiopulmonary arrest (TCPA) patients, many hospital systems have not implemented in-hospital triage guidelines. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if hospital resources could be preserved by implementation of an in-hospital tiered triage system for patients in TCPA with prolonged resuscitation who would likely be declared dead on arrival (DOA). Method: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 4, 618 severely injured patients, admitted to our Level I trauma center from December 2000 to December 2008 for evaluation. All of the identified patients had sustained life-threatening penetrating and blunt injuries with pre-hospital TCPA. Patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for 10 minutes were assessed for survival rate, neurologic outcome, and charge-for-activation (COA) for our hospital trauma system. Results: We evaluated 4, 618 charts, which consisted of patients seen by the MSM trauma service from December 2001 through December 2008. We identified 140 patients with severe, life-threatening traumatic injuries,who sustained pre-hospitalTCPArequiring prolongedCPRin the field andwere brought to the emergency department (ED). Group I was comprised of 108 patients sustaining TCPA (53 blunt, 55 penetrating), who died after receiving, 45 minutes of ACLS after arrival. Group II, which consisted of 32 patients (25 blunt, 7 penetrating), had resuscitative efforts in the EDlasting. 45 minutes, but all ultimately died prior to discharge. Estimated hospital charge-for-activation for Group I was approximately $ 540, 000, based on <b>standard</b> <b>charges</b> of $ 5000 per full-scale trauma system activation (TSA). Conclusion: Full-scale trauma system activation for patients sustaining greater than 10 minutes of prehospital TCPA in the field is futile and economically depleting.
