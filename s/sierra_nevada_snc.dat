5000|$|The {{hybrid rocket}} engine design for SpaceShipTwo has been {{problematic}} and caused extensive delays {{to the flight}} test program. The original rocket engine design was based on hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) fuel and nitrous oxide oxidizer, {{sometimes referred to as}} an N2O/HTPB engine. [...] It was developed by Scaled Composites subcontractor <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> Corporation (<b>SNC)</b> from 2009 to early 2014. In May 2014, Virgin Galactic announced a change to the hybrid engine to be used in SpaceShipTwo, and took the development effort in-house to Virgin Galactic, terminating the contract with <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> and halting all development work on the first-generation rocket engine. [...] Virgin then modified the engine design to include a change of the hybrid rocket fuel from a HTPB to a polyamide fuel formulation. In October 2015, Virgin announced that it was considering changing back to the original HTPB fuel.|$|R

40|$|On December 16, 2006, Tacsat- 2 {{launched}} from Wallops Island, Virginia atop a Minotaur rocket {{to become the}} first Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) Satellite. Some of the objectives of this program were rapid development and rapid deployment of the spacecraft as well as a low mission cost. For example, the spacecraft bus was delivered in 12 months {{from the start of the}} contract. Following the completion of its mission, Tacsat- 2 was recognized by Aviation Week and Space Technology Magazine with its Small Company Product Breakthrough Award. Since this initial success, ORS has grown into a much larger national effort that hopes to revolutionize space missions by using plug and play spacecraft components with a rapid call-up “space wing ” that can replenish, augment and reconstitute national space capabilities. <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> Corporation (<b>SNC)</b> Space Systems a new entity created through the acquisition of MicroSat Systems and SpaceDev by SNC, is building on the success of the TacSat- 2 (TS 2) program and folding that experience into the ORBCOMM Generation 2 augmentation program (OG 2).

40|$|The {{first phase}} of the Autonomous Airborne Refueling Demonstration (AARD) project was {{completed}} on August 30, 2006. The goal of this 15 -month effort was to develop and flight-test a system to demonstrate an autonomous refueling engagement using the Navy style hose-and-drogue air-to-air refueling method. The prime contractor for this Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) sponsored program was <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> Corporation (<b>SNC),</b> Sparks, <b>Nevada.</b> The responsible flight-test organization was the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC), Edwards, California, which also provided the F/A- 18 receiver airplane (McDonnell Douglas, now The Boeing Company, Chicago, Illinois). The B- 707 - 300 tanker airplane (The Boeing Company) was contracted through Omega Aerial Refueling Services, Inc., Alexandria, Virginia, and the optical tracking system was contracted through OCTEC Ltd., Bracknell, Berkshire, United Kingdom. Nine research flights were flown, testing the functionality and performance of the system in a stepwise manner, culminating in the plug attempts on the final flight. Relative position keeping was found to be very stable and accurate. The receiver aircraft was capable of following the tanker aircraft through turns while maintaining its relative position. During the last flight, six capture attempts were made, two of which were successful. The four misses demonstrated excellent characteristics, the receiver retreating from the drogue in a controlled, safe, and predictable manner that precluded contact between the drogue and the receiver aircraft. The position of the receiver aircraft when engaged and in position for refueling was found to be 5. 5 to 8. 5 ft low of the ideal position. The controller inputs to the F/A- 18 were found to be extremely smal...|$|R
