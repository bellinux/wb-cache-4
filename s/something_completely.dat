25|$|This {{was perhaps}} the most bizarre game played during the series. In the game, a large box was revealed, and without any clues or hints whatsoever, Bungalow Heads had to draw what they thought was in the box. The box was then opened to reveal <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> random and almost {{impossible}} to guess.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, {{the band}} tried <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> new, {{recording}} the soundtrack for East German playwright Heiner Müller's play Die Hamletmaschine ("The Hamlet Machine") for East German radio Rundfunk der DDR. The band image of Einstürzende Neubauten changed: Blixa Bargeld, formerly wearing punk/industrial style clothes, {{appeared at the}} live concerts in a suit.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the group's first film, And Now for <b>Something</b> <b>Completely</b> Different, a compilation of sketches from the first two television series, Holy Grail draws on new material. It parodies the legend of King Arthur's quest to find the Holy Grail. Idle used the film {{as the basis for}} the musical Spamalot 30 years later.|$|E

25|$|Bell Beaker {{domestic}} ware has no predecessors in Bohemia and Southern Germany, {{shows no}} genetic {{relation to the}} local Late Copper Age Corded Ware, nor to other cultures in the area, and is considered <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> new. The Bell Beaker domestic ware of Southern Germany are not as {{closely related to the}} Corded Ware as would be indicated by their burial rites. Settlements link the Southern German Bell Beaker culture to the seven regional provinces of the Eastern Group, represented by many settlement traces, especially from Moravia and the Hungarian Bell Beaker-Csepel group being the most important. In 2002 one of the largest Bell Beaker cemeteries in Central Europe was discovered at Hoštice za Hanou (Moravia, Czech Republic).|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} next {{shown at the}} 2007 E3 event in July, where a non-playable demo of the opening level was shown. The next footage was shown at the Games Convention in August when a {{finished}} version of the opening level was shown. The designers revealed the game opened roughly half-way through the story so that players would have an action-based level to begin {{in which they could}} control both Lyra/Pan and Iorek, rather than beginning the game in Jordan College with only Lyra available for control. They also explained that the Alethiometer will function in the game primarily as a means for expanding the story and unlocking bonus content rather than being <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> necessary for completing the game.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between icastic and phantastic imitation, concepts borrowed from Plato, {{is also important}} in Mazzoni’s work. Icastic imitation refers to the recreation of something based in reality – a simulation of a real person or {{the creation of a}} character based on a real person is icastic imitation. Phantastic imitation is the imitation of <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> the artist’s imagination. This distinction would {{play an important role in}} Mazzoni’s On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante, in which he would argue that the work, being allegorical and based in a divine vision, was icastic mimesis because it imitates something “real.” This was meant to counter arguments by writers such as Castravilla who dismissed Dante’s work as lacking in verisimilitude and even claimed that the comedy was not poetry at all, as it was simply the recounting of a vision. Under Mazzoni’s definitions, these were not valid criticisms, as poetry was essentially mimesis made “persuasive” by the use of craft or art.|$|E
50|$|One of McBay’s main goals was to {{pass along}} his love for {{chemistry}} to his students. He regularly demonstrated how two materials could be combined to produce <b>something</b> with <b>completely</b> different properties. One of his frequent demonstrations combined a metallic poison, sodium, with a gaseous poison, chlorine, to produce table salt. He wanted his students to share his fascination with such processes, which he believed to be minor miracles.|$|R

And taman et yado batsalahat, 'buried his hand in the dish,' means that someone idles away his time." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{favourite}} {{to win the}} contest, {{according to}} bookmakers, was Sweden with the pop-ballad [...] "Se på mig". Other countries in contention for the win were Croatia, Denmark, Israel, Spain, and the eventual winner, Norway. The winning song was something new at Eurovision in that it contained only 24 words accompanied by long violin solos. The United Kingdom contributed a modern rap number, while the previous year’s runner-up, Poland, went for <b>something</b> that <b>completely</b> contrasted with their début entry.|$|R
500|$|Despite her {{interest}} in acting from an early age, Pinto was undecided on which career path to take until watching Monster (2003) while at college. She stated: [...] "I guess it was when I watched Monster... I pretty much knew. I {{had to find a}} way. I had to do something like that, <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> transformational." [...] In 2005, Pinto began a modeling career and joined Elite Model Management India, with whom she worked {{for two and a half}} years. She was featured in several television and print advertisements for products such as Wrigley's Chewing Gum, Škoda, Vodafone India, Airtel, Visa, eBay, and De Beers.|$|E
500|$|During {{sessions}} for Door, Door at Richmond Recorders in Melbourne in January 1979, the Boys Next Door recorded [...] "Shivers". Engineer Tony Cohen suggested that Howard perform the vocals for the track, arguing that {{his voice was}} best fitted for his own songs. However, the band's regular vocalist, Nick Cave, insisted on singing on the recording. Howard said later {{that as a result}} of Cave's vocals, [...] "Shivers" [...] was [...] "interpreted completely differently and now the song, to most peoples' minds, is <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> different from what I intended it to be". In hindsight, Cave noted that Howard's vocals should have been recorded, as Cave was [...] "never able to do that song justice".|$|E
500|$|Oxford cox Acer Nethercott said [...] "Our bowman {{came off}} {{his seat and}} could not {{continue}} properly – it was race over after that." [...] Regarding the rejected appeal, he claimed that the umpire [...] "had laid down to both coxes before the race {{that there was a}} way he wanted to conduct the race. [...] And then he did <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> different in the race." [...] Kennelly, the bowman, claimed he was [...] "100 per cent confident that if what happened didn't happen we would have won" [...] while Cambridge cox Kenelm Richardson stated [...] "The umpire was very good and told me to hold my line, so I knew I was exactly where I needed to be".|$|E

5000|$|Creech (voiced by Sugar Lyn Beard) is {{the young}} ruler of the Cybersite Tikiville. She became the {{apparent}} Big Kahuna (the term for their rulers in Tikiville) after competing in a race with other Tikiville-inhabitants as well as Hacker. Creech {{is in some ways}} similar to Inez, helping the two to become friends easily. Both have a fairly similar outlook: optimistic until <b>something</b> goes <b>completely</b> wrong, and they both have a large vocabulary. She also is the person in charge of Tikiville's Egg of Benedicta.|$|R
50|$|Panacea {{was said}} to have a {{poultice}} or potion with which she healed the sick. This brought about the concept of the panacea in medicine, a substance meant to cure all diseases.

500|$|... "Fionna and Cake" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Rebecca Sugar and Adam Muto from a story {{developed}} by Mark Banker, Patrick McHale, Osborne, and series creator Pendleton Ward. The entry {{was directed by}} Larry Leichliter. The genesis for the episode were drawings that character designer and storyboard revisionist Natasha Allegri posted onto the internet during her free time. Her creations were eventually canonized by the show's producers. Allegri even re-rerecorded the show's theme — which had originally been sung by series creator Pendleton Ward — for the episode. Sugar intended [...] "Fionna and Cake" [...] to both be [...] "a jab [...] a huge celebration of, [...] {{the feeling of being}} fan" [...] and [...] "allowing <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> ridiculous to make your heart tighten".|$|E
500|$|... "Gypsies, Tramps and Weed" [...] {{was written}} by Katie Palmer and {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows. In October 2000, {{it was confirmed that}} singer-songwriter Cher would guest star on Will & Grace as herself. She filmed her appearance on October 17. Cher revealed, [...] "We did two endings. I improvised one. I hope they show it as an outtake 'cause the audience loved that one more than the one they're gonna show. Instead of the thing I was supposed to do, I did something to Sean [...] <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> different and he just about passed out. I don't know what possessed me." [...] It was also announced that actress Camryn Manheim would appear. Cher would later guest star on Will & Grace two years later.|$|E
500|$|Moore emailed {{his work}} back to Matheos, who was [...] "pleasantly surprised" [...] {{to be sent}} <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> {{different}} from what he expected. Matheos {{wanted to create a}} heavy album; before deciding to takes Moore's ideas further, Matheos and Moore wrote what would become [...] "OSI". Moore said that after that, [...] " [...] was pretty much comfortable with whatever I wanted to do." [...] This new song format was very different from what Portnoy and Matheos originally planned: the already-written long tracks were split into multiple short songs, closer to Moore's project Chroma Key than traditional progressive metal. [...] "The Thing That Never Was", a track on the bonus disc, shows the direction Matheos and Portnoy originally planned to take the album in.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{do think}} that our {{perception}} of reality is fragmentary, and in 20th-century literature, it's totally normal to not describe reality as <b>something</b> whole and <b>completely</b> transportable and explicable.

500|$|As Karellen explains, {{the time}} of {{humanity}} as a race composed of single individuals with a concrete identity {{is coming to an}} end. The children's minds reach into each other and merge into a single vast group consciousness. If the Pacific were to be dried up, the islands dotting it would lose their identity as islands and become part of a new continent; in the same way, the children cease to be the individuals which their parents knew and become <b>something</b> else, <b>completely</b> alien to the [...] "old type of human".|$|R

500|$|The Ramones {{played before}} an {{audience}} {{for the first time}} on March 30, 1974, at Performance Studios. The songs they played were very fast and very short; most clocked in at under two minutes. Around this time, a new music scene was emerging in New York centered on two clubs in downtown Manhattan—Max's Kansas City and, more famously, CBGB (usually referred to as CBGB's). The Ramones made their CBGB debut on August 16, 1974. Legs McNeil, who cofounded Punk magazine the following year, later described the impact of that performance: [...] "They were all wearing these black leather jackets. And they counted off this song... and it was just this wall of noise... They looked so striking. These guys were not hippies. This was <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> new." ...|$|E
500|$|Shen Kuo {{wrote that}} during the Qingli reign period (1041–1048), under Emperor Renzong of Song (1022–1063), an obscure {{commoner}} and artisan known as Bi Sheng (990–1051) invented ceramic movable type printing. Although the use of assembling individual characters to compose {{a piece of text}} had its origins in antiquity, Bi Sheng's methodical innovation was <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> revolutionary for his time. Shen Kuo noted that the process was tedious if one only wanted to print a few copies of a book, but if one desired to make hundreds or thousands of copies, the process was incredibly fast and efficient. Beyond Shen Kuo's writing, however, nothing is known of Bi Sheng's life or the influence of movable type in his lifetime. Although the details of Bi Sheng's life were scarcely known, Shen Kuo wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|During recording, Eno created several {{prototype}} mixes of the song. The Edge {{recalled how}} these different mixes assisted the band {{in creating the}} final version of the track. One of these early versions was later released under the title [...] "Bottoms (Watashitachi No Ookina Yume)" [...] as a bonus track on the UK and Japanese promotional releases of the experimental 1995 album Original Soundtracks 1 by Passengers, a side project by U2 and Eno, as well as a B-side on some versions of the [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] single. [...] "Bottoms (Watashitachi No Ookina Yume)" [...] is an instrumental track and was described by The Edge as a [...] "crazy" [...] mix.

5000|$|According to moe. bassist and vocalist Rob Derhak, [...] "Basically, {{everything}} {{we started out}} to do turned into <b>completely</b> <b>something</b> else.

500|$|Robinson {{described}} [...] "Flicker" [...] {{as more of}} a [...] "journey" [...] than a pop song, {{saying that}} it goes [...] "to a lot of different places" [...] structure-wise. The text-to-speech speaker on the song says [...] "Watashi wa choudo nani ga juuyou ka mitsukeyou toshite iru,” translating to “I’m just trying to find what is important to me,” which Robinson said was [...] "nice, because it could have come out as <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> random." [...] The song also contains influences of disco, opening with a [...] "summer-y disco guitar" [...] before moving into [...] "hands-in-the-air synth blasts" [...] as a critic for Vice magazine described. The pitch shifting of the samples was influenced by the works of Jay Dilla. The song's composition and arrangement was compared by Spin magazine's Garrett Kamps to the works of Boards of Canada, while other listeners compared the track's use of soul samples to that of [...] "The Glory," [...] a track from Kanye West's third album Graduation (2007).|$|E
500|$|The Trojan War {{provided}} {{a variety of}} themes and became a main source of inspiration for Ancient Greek artists (e.g. metopes on the Parthenon depicting the sack of Troy); this artistic preference for themes deriving from the Trojan Cycle indicates its importance to the Ancient Greek civilization. The same mythological cycle also inspired a series of posterior European literary writings. For instance, Trojan Medieval European writers, unacquainted with Homer at first hand, found in the Troy legend {{a rich source of}} heroic and romantic storytelling and a convenient framework into which to fit their own courtly and chivalric ideals. Twelfth-century authors, such as Benoît de Sainte-Maure (Roman de Troie [...] ) and Joseph of Exeter (De Bello Troiano [...] ) describe the war while rewriting the standard version they found in Dictys and Dares. They thus follow Horace's advice and Virgil's example: they rewrite a poem of Troy instead of telling <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> new.|$|E
500|$|Among other {{contemporary}} rock musicians, Stephen Stills was {{so taken}} with the song that he had its lyrics carved on a stone monument in his yard. Lennon also admired the track, saying of Harrison: [...] "His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together." [...] David Crosby, who introduced Harrison to Shankar's music in 1965, described Harrison's fusion of ideas as [...] "utterly brilliant", adding: [...] "He did it beautifully and tastefully... He did it at absolutely the highest level that he could, and I was extremely proud of him for that." [...] Writing in the [...] "100 Rock Icons" [...] issue of Classic Rock, in 2006, singer Paul Rodgers cited the track to support Harrison's standing as what the magazine called [...] "the Beatles' musical medicine man". Rodgers said: [...] "He introduced me and a generation of people worldwide to {{the wisdom of the}} East. His thought-provoking 'Within You Without You' – with sitars, tablas and deep lyrics – was <b>something</b> <b>completely</b> different, even in a world full of unique music." ...|$|E
