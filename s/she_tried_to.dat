5|$|Knowles rehearsed {{the pole}} dancing using two ballet bars, which {{was when it}} was decided to add a pole above her head to form an arc. Though she is from Texas, she had never {{previously}} been on mechanical bull. There were no problems during warm-ups, but the man operating the bull during the video shoot programmed it to go faster, causing Knowles to fall off when <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> perform tricks such as lifting up her foot, leaning back and turning around. To minimize the time Knowles spent on the bull, the director shot the sequence at twelve frames per second (see frame rate) and Knowles sang twice as quickly, but it wasn't until 4:00am that they completed work.|$|E

5|$|Making several {{attempts}} to close on Endymion, Decatur discovered that Presidents damage limited her maneuverability, allowing Endymion to anticipate, and draw away from, positions favorable for boarding. Faced {{with this new}} dilemma, Decatur ordered bar and chain shot fired to disable Endymions sails and rigging, the idea being to shake his pursuer and allow President to proceed to a safe port without being followed. At noon, Endymion, being the much better sailer, was close-hauled, outpacing her squadron and leaving them behind. At 2pm, she gained on President and took position on the American ship's quarter, shooting into President as <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> escape. Endymion was able to rake President three times and did considerable damage to her; by contrast, President primarily directed her fire at Endymion's rigging in order to slow her down during the two-hour engagement.|$|E
5|$|McDougal was {{released}} {{at the end}} of the trial and returned home. The following day she went to buy whisky and was confronted by a mob who were angry at the not proven verdict.

On 3 January 1829, on the advice of both Catholic priests and Presbyterian clergy, Burke made another confession. This was more detailed than the official one provided prior to his trial; he placed much of the blame for the murders on Hare.|$|E
5|$|The ballad, The Mermaid of Padstow, tells {{a similar}} story of a local named Tom Yeo, who shot the mermaid mistaking her for a seal.

When she could no longer bear living without him, <b>she</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> lure him beneath the waves but he escaped by {{shooting}} her. In her rage she threw a handful of sand towards Padstow, around which the sandbank grew. In other versions of the tale, the mermaid sings from the rocks and a youth shoots at her with a crossbow, or a greedy man shoots her with a longbow. Mermaids were believed to sing to their victims so that they can lure adulterers to their death.|$|E
