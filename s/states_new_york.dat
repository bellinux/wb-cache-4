25|$|Consensus {{held that}} if Virginia, {{the most populous}} state at the time, did not ratify the Constitution, the new {{national}} government would not likely succeed. When the Virginia Ratifying Convention began on June 2, 1788, the Constitution {{had not yet been}} ratified by the required nine <b>states.</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> the second largest state and a bastion of anti-federalism, would likely not ratify it without Virginia, and Virginia's exclusion from the new government would disqualify Virginian George Washington from being the first president. Virginia delegates believed that Washington's election as the first president was a condition for their acceptance of the new constitution and the new government. Arguably the most prominent anti-federalist, the powerful orator Patrick Henry was a delegate and had a following second only to Washington (who was not a delegate). Most delegates believed that Virginians mainly opposed the constitution. Initially Madison did not want to stand for election to the Virginia ratifying convention, but was persuaded to do so because the situation looked so bad. His role at the convention was likely critical to Virginia's ratification, and thus {{to the success of the}} constitution generally.|$|E
25|$|According to the 2010 United States Census, New York City had {{the largest}} {{population}} of self-defined Black residents of any U.S. city, with over 2,000,000 within the city's boundaries, although this number has decreased since 2000. New York City had more Black people than did {{the entire state of}} California until the 1980 United States Census. The Black population consists of immigrants and their descendants from Africa and the Caribbean as well as native-born African-Americans. Many of the city's black residents live in Brooklyn and The Bronx. Several of the city's neighborhoods are historical birthplaces of urban Black culture in America, among them the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford–Stuyvesant and Manhattan's Harlem and various sections of Eastern Queens and The Bronx. Bedford-Stuyvesant is considered to have the highest concentration of Black residents in the United <b>States.</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City has the largest population of Black immigrants (at 686,814) and descendants of immigrants from the Caribbean (especially from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Guyana, Belize, Grenada, and Haiti), and of sub-Saharan Africans. In a news item of April 3, 2006, however, the New York Times noted {{that for the first time}} since the American Civil War, the recorded African-American population was declining, because of emigration to other regions, a declining African-American birthrate in New York, and decreased immigration of Blacks from the Caribbean and Africa.|$|E

500|$|The {{emergence}} of abstract art {{coincided with the}} invention of Cubism in Paris {{in the first decade}} of the 20th Century. Paris remained the centre of gravity for later art movements like Futurism, Purism, Vorticism, Cubo-Futurism, Dada, Constructivism and Surrealism until the outbreak of World War II and the Nazi persecution of [...] "degenerate art", which precipitated a mass migration of artists and performers to the United <b>States.</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> became home to the transplanted avant-garde.|$|E
500|$|The next National Woman’s Rights Convention met in Cincinnati on October 17 and 18, 1855. It {{was here}} that Stone {{delivered}} impromptu remarks that became famous as her [...] "disappointment" [...] speech. When a heckler interrupted the proceedings, calling female speakers [...] "a few disappointed women," [...] Stone retorted that yes, she was indeed a [...] "disappointed woman." [...] "In education, in marriage, in religion, in everything, disappointment is the lot of woman. It shall be the business {{of my life to}} deepen this disappointment in every woman's heart until she bows down to it no longer." [...] The convention adopted Stone’s resolution calling for the circulation of petitions and saying it was “the duty of women in their respective States to ask the legislators for the elective franchise.” Following the convention, suffrage petitioning took place in the New England <b>states,</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nebraska, with resultant legislative hearings or action in Nebraska and Wisconsin. Amelia Bloomer, recently moved to Iowa near the Nebraska border, took up the work in that area, while the Indiana Woman’s Rights Society, at least one of whose officers was at the Cincinnati convention, directed the work in Indiana. Stone had helped launch the New York campaign at a state woman’s rights convention in Saratoga Springs in August, and at the Cleveland convention recruited workers for it, {{as well as for the}} work in Illinois, Michigan and Ohio. Stone took charge of the work in Ohio, her new home state, drafting its petition, placing it in Ohio newspapers and circulating it during lectures across southern Ohio while her recruit worked in the northern part of the state. Stone also lectured in Illinois and Indiana in support of the petition drives there and personally introduced the work in Wisconsin, where she found volunteers to circulate the petition and legislators to introduce them in both houses of the legislature.|$|E
