50|$|An {{interlock}} is {{a feature}} that makes the state of two mechanisms or functions mutually dependent. It {{may be used to}} prevent undesired states in a finite-state machine, and may consist of any electrical, electronic, or mechanical devices or systems. In most applications, an interlock is used to help prevent a machine from harming its operator or damaging itself by preventing one element from changing state due to the state of another element, and vice versa. Elevators are equipped with an interlock that prevents the moving elevator from opening its doors, and prevents the <b>stationary</b> <b>elevator</b> (with open doors) from moving. Although both are idiot proof strategies, an interlock {{should not be confused with}} a simple safety switch. For example, in a typical household microwave oven, the switch that disables the magnetron if the door is opened is not an interlock. Rather, it would be considered an interlock if the door were locked while the magnetron is on, and the magnetron were prevented from operating while the door is open. Interlocks may include sophisticated elements such as curtains of infrared beams, photodetectors, a computer containing an interlocking computer program, digital or analogue electronics, or simple switches and locks.|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{simulation}} of dynamics of elevator systems {{is important in}} addressing challenges {{in the design of}} elevators. This dissertation is dedicated to the methodologies and applications of the numerical {{simulation of}} the dynamics of elevator cable-car systems, pulley-cable systems, and traveling and compensation cables. A new spatial discretization and substructure method is developed to calculate the dynamic responses of one-dimensional systems, which consist of length-variant distributed-parameter components such as strings, rods, and beams, and lumped-parameter components such as point masses and rigid bodies. This methodology is used to study the longitudinal, transverse, and their coupled dynamics of moving elevator cable-car systems. There are complicated matching conditions between the cable and the car, which cannot be satisfied in traditional methods, but can be satisfied in the current method. Hence not only the displacements, but also the internal forces/moment, such as the axial force, the bending moment, and the shear force, which are related to the spatial derivatives of the longitudinal or transverse displacement, are accurately calculated. The longitudinal-transverse coupled vibrations of a moving cable-car system are also studied using this method, and the results are compared with those from the linear models. While the result from the linear model for the transverse vibration agrees well with that from the nonlinear coupled model, the axial force calculated from the linear model can significantly differ from that from the nonlinear model when the car approaches the top of the hoist way. It is found that a large slope in the transverse vibration can significantly increase the vibratory tension in the cable, and attenuate the safety of the system. These results can be explained by theoretical analysis and verified by the absolute nodal coordinate formulation. The methodology is also used in conjunction with a simple belt creep model to study the dynamics of pulley-cable systems. A nonlinear, planar model of a slack cable with bending stiffness and arbitrarily moving ends is developed, using the slope angle of the centroid line of the cable to describe the motion of the cable, and is applied to elevator traveling and compensation cables. It is found that a vertical motion of the car can introduce a horizontal vibration of a traveling or compensation cable. This model is more efficient than the finite element models as it uses a much smaller number of elements to reach the same accuracy. Moreover, based on the asymptotic analysis of this model, a computationally efficient, linear model is developed for calculating the natural frequencies, mode shapes, and dynamic responses of <b>stationary</b> <b>elevator</b> traveling and compensation cables. The linear cable model consists of two vertical cable segments connected by a half circular loop at the bottom. There is a good agreement between the predictions from the linear and nonlinear models and between the measured natural frequencies from a full-scale experiment and the corresponding calculated ones...|$|E
50|$|Gearless {{traction}} {{machines are}} low-speed (low-RPM), high-torque electric motors powered either by AC or DC. In this case, the drive sheave is directly {{attached to the}} end of the motor. Gearless traction elevators can reach speeds of up to 4000 ft/min m/s, A brake is mounted between the motor and gearbox or between the motor and drive sheave or at the end of the drive sheave to hold the <b>elevator</b> <b>stationary</b> at a floor. This brake is usually an external drum type and is actuated by spring force and held open electrically; a power failure will cause the brake to engage and prevent the elevator from falling (see inherent safety and safety engineering). But it can also be some form of disc type like 1 or more calipers over a disc in one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in high speed, high rise and large capacity elevators with machine rooms(an exception is the Kone MonoSpace's EcoDisc which is not high speed, high rise and large capacity and is machine room less but it uses the same design as is a thinner version of a conventional gearless traction machine) for braking power, compactness and redundancy (assuming there's at least 2 calipers on the disc), or 1 or more disc brakes with a single caliper at one end of the motor shaft or drive sheave which is used in machine room less elevators for compactness, braking power, and redundancy (assuming there's 2 brakes or more).|$|R
