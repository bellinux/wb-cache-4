40|$|The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity is {{an internationally}} binding {{instrument}} addressing issues of biosafety. Biosafety {{refers to the}} need to protect {{human health and the environment}} from the possible adverse effects of the products of modern biotechnology. Accordingly all countries to the convention are required to put in place regulatory mechanisms to enhance the safety of biotechnology in the context of the Convention’s overall goal of reducing all potential threats to biological diversity, while taking into account the risks to human health. Therefore each country party to the convention has its own procedures to enact laws to guide the safe use of biotechnology. In Uganda the process involves the drafting of the bill by the first parliamentary counsel, approval by cabinet, first reading at the parliament, committal to the responsible parliamentary <b>sessional</b> <b>committee,</b> tabling of the bill for public hearing, consultations, and final approval. In Uganda, the Committee on Science and Technology is responsible for the Biosafety Bill. In March 2013, the Committee tabled the bill for public hearing and submissions from public institutions. There were comments supporting the passage of the Bill and comments in objection. The reasons for objection are mainly due to precaution, speculation, lack of knowledge about biotechnology and biosafety, and alleged influence from biosafety entrepreneurs. This article reviews these public views, revealing controversy and possible consensus to pass the bill...|$|E

5000|$|The House of Lords {{also has}} 15 Select Committees. Typically, these are <b>sessional</b> <b>committees,</b> meaning that their members are {{appointed}} by the House {{at the beginning of}} each session, and continue to serve until the next parliamentary session begins. In practice, these are often permanent committees, which are re-established during every session. These committees are typically empowered to make reports to the House [...] "from time to time", that is, whenever they wish. Other committees are ad-hoc committees, which are set up to investigate a specific issue. When they are set up by a motion in the House, the motion will set a deadline by which the Committee must report. After this date, the Committee will cease to exist unless it is granted an extension. One example of this is the Committee on Public Service and Demographic Change. The House of Lords may appoint a chairman for a committee; if it does not do so, the Chairman of Committees or a Deputy Chairman of Committees may preside instead. Most of the Select Committees are also granted the power to co-opt members, such as the European Union Committee. The primary function of Select Committees is to scrutinise and investigate Government activities; to fulfil these aims, they are permitted to hold hearings and collect evidence. Bills may be referred to Select Committees, but are more often sent to the Committee of the Whole House and Grand Committees.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a history of {{cultural}} patterns which existed in Canada during the 1840 s. In examining the numerous attitudes, values and sentiments shared by Canadians, I have attempted to provide firstly, an overall description of the cultural condition of the colony and, secondly, a clearer {{understanding of the nature of}} the relationship of French and English speaking Canadians. They were very different from each other, divided by characteristics as fundamental as religion, language, and place of origin, and separated by other important impediments like climate and geography. While not denying their distinctions, this dissertation stresses their similarities. It illustrates the cultural community of Canadians by studying their attitudes towards the age in which they lived. For example, they were committed to progress and improvement. Moreover, they were enchanted with technological advances like the railroad and telegraph and they were convinced that a modern and practical education was a good way to change society for the better. Common values of Canadians are demonstrated by observing how they reacted to the difficulties and trials of everyday life, such as fire, sickness and violence. While they endured and responded to these phenomena in a similar fashion, they also fell upon the same solutions to their problems, one of the most interesting being temperance. Further shared cultural patterns are found in their opinions on crime and mental illness. Finally, common sentiments are demonstrated by their ideas regarding religion, the artistic and literary condition of the colony, and the place of women, children and native people in the community. To investigate the cultural patterns of Canadians and to study their shared attitudes, I have used the most obvious printed sources in both French and English, such as newspapers, government documents, official correspondence, <b>sessional</b> papers, <b>committee</b> reports, parliamentary debates, public inquiries, contemporary books, travel guides, pamphlets, magazines, reviews and some selected manuscript sources. Extensive examination of this material leads me to the conclusion that while culturally Canadians were far from sophisticated or advanced in these years, they shared a great deal. While it cannot be claimed that they were the same, their resemblance to each other was often uncanny. The agreement of Canadians on so many matters and the similarity of their cultural attitudes, values and sentiments balances more traditional perceptions of them as being basically antagonistic towards each other. Perhaps the shared cultural patterns illustrated here partly explain why and how Canadians managed to live together fairly reasonably and peacefully during the first decade of the Union. Their positive experiences together is one of the least studied elements of their relationship in this period. Hopefully, this thesis will be regarded as an initial effort in correcting that situation...|$|R

If this issue has been so topical, it is because a variety of factors, some highly controversial and others difficult to measure accurately, have contributed to the phenomenon. They include: the increasingly unstable macroeconomic context; the frequency with which households lapse into and emerge from poverty, a trend seen even among traditionally secure groups; various signs of fragmentation and social asymmetries; defencelessness against different types of risk, some of which have been growing; and new forms of segmentation of access to important assets in terms of social mobility. Conscious of this situation, national delegations attending the meeting of the ECLAC <b>sessional</b> Ad Hoc <b>Committee</b> on Population and Development held during the twenty-ninth session of the Commission (Mexico, D. F., April 2000) requested the Population Division of ECLAC-Latin American and Caribbean Demographic Centre (CELADE) to prepare a document on social vulnerability. In response to this mandate, which was embodied in resolution 577 (XXVIII) of the Commission, a summary version 1 of the document, Socio-demographic vulnerability: old and new risks for communities, households and individuals", 2 was prepared thanks to the valuable support of other ECLAC divisions and the technical and financial cooperation provided by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and was presented and considered at the following ECLAC session (Brasilia, May 2002). The text now being presented in electronic format consists of two chapters of the document. The first reviews the literature on the subject and describes in detail the approach and notion of vulnerability, which are considered relevant for the analysis of relationships between population and development at the level of households, communities and individuals. The second presents the conclusions formulated with a view to proposing policy options for addressing the problem of socio-demographic vulnerability and for obtaining a deeper insight into the relationship between population and development. This material is being published electronically in response to an explicit request from countries represented on the ECLAC <b>sessional</b> Ad Hoc <b>Committee</b> on Population and Development and to a need identified in recent months, when technical assistance on socio-demographic vulnerability was being provided to countries in the region. The issue has aroused tremendous interest and high expectations, but is also the subject of doubts and skepticism. Hence, both the first chapter, which examines and elucidates the conceptual approach and the conclusions seek to give a clear picture of the scope, potential and limitations of the study of socio-demographic vulnerability in the region. The application of a notion of vulnerability that incorporates in a logical chain socio-demographic risks and the ability to respond and adapt is extremely useful, especially for considering emerging issues relating to population and development from the point of view of the individual, the household and the community and for the adoption of appropriate measures in this regard. This does not mean that the notion of socio-demographic vulnerability is cut and dried or can be interpreted in a single way or that the approach used in this case is superior to earlier approaches. This study is, rather, a contribution to the difficult and invariably complex task of understanding and predicting the demographic dynamic and of acting intelligently in this respect in order to promote recognition of individual rights, improve living conditions of households and further the economic and social development of communities. ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyAt {{the meeting}} of the ECLAC <b>sessional</b> Ad Hoc <b>Committee</b> on Population and Development, held during the thirtieth session of ECLAC in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 29 and 30 June 2004, the country {{delegations}} recommended that at its next regular meeting, to be held in 2006, the Ad Hoc Committee should analyse the subject of international migration, human rights and development, and requested the secretariat of the Ad Hoc Committee, in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund, to prepare the relevant substantive documents, pursuant to the mandate contained in Resolution 604 (XXX). In response to this request, the Latin American and Caribbean Demographic Centre (CELADE) - Population Division of ECLAC has drawn up this summary, based on the document entitled Cuatro aspectos centrales en torno a la migración internacional, derechos humanos y desarrollo" (LC/L. 2490). 1 This text is intended to provide guidance to governments in the region so that they may face the most important challenges and opportunities for development presented by migration, with an approach that also takes into account the human rights of migrants and their families. The study has been enriched by the participation of CELADE in numerous meetings, workshops and seminars involving governments, academics, civil society and experts, and by the conclusions reached at these gatherings. It has also benefited from many of the studies reported in CELADE publications, from the intense effort made by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations Population Division and other entities in the system, and from the contributions of experts and academics in the region. The first part of the study presents an overview of the current context in which migratory movements are taking place, paying particular attention to the forces of globalization, the upsurge in transnationalism, the impact these phenomena have on the countries of the region and initiatives launched with a view to achieving migration governance. It is followed by a description of migration trends and patterns, with an emphasis on stylized facts. Three dimensions of the problems and potentials of international migration from Latin America and the Caribbean are examined: remittances, migration and gender, and the migration of skilled workers. Each of them is a source of concern and opportunities for development, and the respective contrasts are explored. Next comes an analysis of the ways that migration intersects with human rights, in which the problems of vulnerability and the need to protect migrants are highlighted. This analysis also underscores the active role that countries can play in this regard, both nationally and multilaterally and in conjunction with civil society organizations. And finally, some general conclusions and guidelines are proposed for migration governance, taking into account the specific characteristics of the region and accentuating the protection of migrants' human rights as a key reference point. Emphasis is placed on the need to promote and strengthen multilateral cooperation as a legitimate means of ensuring that international migration contributes {{to the development of the}} countries in the region. The central message of this document is that international migration is a question of development and of rights. This requires the promotion of comprehensive measures that will ensure that international migration is managed from a Latin American and Caribbean perspective, enhance free mobility, achieve the potential of positive externalities and protect the human rights of all migrants. It is hoped that the analyses and conclusions presented here will be useful in supporting the high-level dialogue on international migration and development that will take place in the United Nations General Assembly in 2006. As the Secretary General of the organization stressed on the occasion of International Migrants Day (18 December 2005), this is an opportunity for Member States to begin forging closer cooperation on these important issues so that they can take full advantage of the benefits of migration, address the myriad problems and concerns raised by migration, and do more to ensure respect for the human rights of migrant workers and their families. ...|$|R
