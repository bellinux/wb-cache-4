The clear geographical divide between the mountainous western areas of southern Britain and the generally lower-lying areas to the east was reflected in the pattern of Roman occupation. The main Roman military bases for the control of what became Wales were beyond the mountains, at Deva (Chester), Viroconium (Wroxeter, near Shrewsbury), and Isca Augusta (Caerleon, near Newport), all located close to the later national border.|$|E

40|$|The WASP {{family of}} {{proteins}} plays {{a pivotal role}} in the cell, integrating signals from extracellular stimuli to generate dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton. The WASP family of proteins consists of three subfamilies; the WASP subfamily which contains the haematopoietically expressed WASP and its ubiquitously expressed homologue N-WASP, the WAVE subfamily comprising WAVE 1 - 3, and the recently identified WASH subfamily. All three <b>sub-families</b> contain a C-terminal VCA domain, through which they nucleate actin polymerisation via activation of the Arp 2 / 3 complex.

25|$|An {{oncogene}} is a {{gene that}} is mutated or expressed at high levels, and thus helps turn a normal cell into a tumor cell. In the late 1970s, Robert Weinberg {{and his team of}} researchers began the search for a human oncogene. Using gene transfer techniques, researchers in his lab inserted DNA from human bladder tumor cells into normal animal cells. When the animal cells turned cancerous, Dr. Weinberg's associates began inserting smaller pieces of DNA into the normal cell. By 1980, they found a single fragment that turned the normal cell cancerous. This gene was found to belong to a <b>sub-family</b> of related genes, called ras, that was later discovered {{to play a role in}} causing bladder, lung, and colon cancer in both rats and humans. More results emerged in 1982 when Dr. Weinberg's laboratory discovered that a single, subtle genetic glitch in this oncogene topples the delicate balance between a bladder cell's normal and cancerous states.|$|E

The de-sign of our models is based on a new principle supported by uniform convergence bounds and taking into consideration the complexity of the different <b>sub-families</b> composing the full set of features. We prove new data-dependent learning bounds for our models, expressed in terms of the Rademacher complexities of these <b>sub-families.</b> We also prove a duality theorem, which we use to derive our Structural Maxent algorithm. We give a full description of our algorithm, including the details of its derivation, and report the results of several experiments demonstrating that its per-formance improves on that of existing L 1 -norm regularized Maxent algorithms. We further sim-ilarly define conditional Structural Maxent mod-els for multi-class classification problems. These are conditional probability models also making use of a union of possibly complex feature <b>sub-families.</b> We prove a duality theorem for these models as well, which reveals their connection with existing binary and multi-class deep boost-ing algorithms...|$|R

2500|$|Nodule {{formation}} is common throughout the leguminosae, {{it is found}} in the majority of its members that only form an association with rhizobia, which in turn form an exclusive symbiosis with the leguminosae (with the exception of Parasponia, the only genus of the 18 Ulmaceae genera that is capable of forming nodules). Nodule {{formation is}} present in all the leguminosae sub-families, although it is less common in the Caesalpinioideae. All types of nodule formation are present in the <b>sub-family</b> Papilionoideae: [...] indeterminate (with the meristem retained), determinate (without meristem) and the type included in Aeschynomene. The latter two are thought to be the most modern and specialised type of nodule as they are only present in some lines of the Papilionoideae <b>sub-family.</b> Even though nodule formation is common in the two monophyletic subfamilies Papilionoideae and Mimosoideae they also contain species that do not form nodules. The presence or absence of nodule-forming species within the three sub-families indicates that nodule formation has arisen several times during the evolution of the leguminosae and that this ability has been lost in some lineages. For example, within the genus Acacia, a member of the Mimosoideae, A. pentagona does not form nodules, while other species of the same genus readily form nodules, as is the case for Acacia senegal, which forms both rapidly and slow growing rhizobial nodules.|$|E

It gradually came to supplant the native languages of the region, but due to its wide geographic distribution and political circumstances, it soon evolved into two major <b>sub-families,</b> the Western <b>sub-families</b> comprising Palestinian Talmudic, Christian Palestinian, and Samaritan and the Eastern subfamilies comprising Jewish Babylonian Aramaic (which was in use until the Geonic period), Syriac, and Mandaic.|$|R

2500|$|TAL (transcription activator-like) effectors (often {{referred}} to as TALEs, but {{not to be confused}} with the three amino acid loop extension homeobox <b>sub-family</b> of proteins) are proteins secreted by Xanthomonas bacteria via their type III secretion system when they infect various plant species. [...] These proteins can bind promoter sequences in the host plant and activate the expression of plant genes that aid bacterial infection. [...] They recognize plant DNA sequences through a central repeat domain consisting of a variable number of ~34 amino acid repeats. [...] There appears to be a one-to-one correspondence between the identity of two critical amino acids in each repeat and each DNA base in the target sequence. [...] These proteins are interesting to researchers both for their role in disease of important crop species and the relative ease of retargeting them to bind new DNA sequences. [...] Similar proteins can be found in the pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and Burkholderia rhizoxinica., as well as yet unidentified marine microorganisms. The term TALE-likes is used to refer to the putative protein family encompassing the TALEs and these related proteins.|$|E
