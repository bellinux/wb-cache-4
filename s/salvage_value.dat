The drama was not quite over however. Having just saved a $600,000 ship and its $250,000 cargo along with the passengers and crew from destruction, Brady felt insulted by a gift of just $1,000 offered by the American Steamship Company. He promptly sued for the full <b>salvage</b> <b>value</b> of the vessel, and in the subsequent court case, in which one witness after another testified in his favour, Brady was eventually awarded the sum of $4,000 plus $200 expenses, which after legal fees netted him the significantly improved sum of $2,550.|$|E

Airlines using the 747-400 have accelerated its retirement (as of 2015) and are replacing the model with more fuel efficient aircraft. The main appeal of the 747-400 like its predecessors was its range rather than its capacity, and in many cases it has been replaced by wide-body twin-engine aircraft of similar range such as the Boeing 777 and Boeing 787. The change in emphasis from hub and spoke operations to point-to-point flights has also reduced the need for jumbo jets. Airlines such as British Airways and Qantas who plan to maintain the same capacity on routes currently served by 747-400s have ordered the Airbus A380 rather than the updated 747-8.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a supply contracting problem {{in which the}} buyer firm faces non-stationary stochastic price and demand. First, we derive analytical results to compare two pure strategies: (i) periodically purchasing from the spot market; and (ii) signing a long-term contract with a single supplier. The results from the pure strategies show that the selection of suppliers can be complicated by many parameters, and is particularly affected by price uncertainty. We then develop a stochastic dynamic programming model to incorporate mixed strategies, purchasing commitments and contract cancellations. Computational results show that increases in price (demand) uncertainty favor long-term (short-term) suppliers. By examining the two-way interactions of contract factors (price, demand, purchasing bounds, learning and technology effect, <b>salvage</b> <b>values</b> and contract cancellation), both intuitive and non-intuitive managerial insights in outsourcing strategies are derived.

We show that the optimal selling scheme nicely resembles the classical multiunit auction design, and the product is returned too often compared to the efficient scenario. Furthermore, even though the postpurchase information update is privately observed by the individual consumers, the seller does not give away additional surplus to the consumers. Our general framework can accommodate various heterogeneities and uncertainties regarding hassle costs, shipping costs, <b>salvage</b> <b>values,</b> and reservation values.

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} deciding whether to keep {{a piece of equipment}} or to replace it with a more advanced technology. This decision must take into account both the nature of the available replacement technology and the possibility of future technological advances. Existing models are restrictive in the way they model the appearance of future technologies and the costs and revenues associated with those technologies. In an earlier paper we allowed the probability of appearance of new technologies to be non-stationary in time but required the costs and revenues of technologies to be different but constant over time. In this paper, we allow the technology forecasts and revenue functions associated with technologies to be non-stationary in time and consider <b>salvage</b> <b>values</b> for technologies. We develop a simple and efficient algorithm for finding the optimal decision using a forecast horizon approach. This approach finds the optimal decision in any period with minimal reliance on forecast data...|$|R
40|$|Bottoming cycle {{concepts}} {{for heavy}} duty transport engine applications were studied. In particular, the following tasks were performed: (1) conceptual design and cost data development for Stirling systems; (2) life-cycle cost evaluation of three bottoming systems - organic Rankine, steam Rankine, and Stirling cycles; and (3) assessment of future directions in waste heat utilization research. Variables {{considered for the}} second task were initial capital investments, fuel savings, depreciation tax benefits, <b>salvage</b> <b>values,</b> and service/maintenance costs. The study shows {{that none of the}} three bottoming systems studied are even marginally attractive. Manufacturing costs have to be reduced by at least 65 %. As a new approach, an integrated Rankine/Diesel system was proposed. It utilizes one of the diesel cylinders as an expander and capitalizes on the in-cylinder heat energy. The concept eliminates the need for the power transmission device and a sophisticated control system, and reduces the size of the exhaust evaporator. Results of an economic evaluation indicate that the system has the potential to become an attractive package for end users...|$|R
