However, the dosimetric characteristics of small animal PET imaging are usually overlooked, although the radiation dose may be significant. The variations of anatomical characteristics between the various computational models may result in differences in the dosimetric outcome. We used five different anatomical rat models (two stylized and three voxel based) to compare calculated absorbed fractions and <b>S</b> <b>values</b> for eight positron-emitting radionuclides (C- 11, N- 13, O- 15, F- 18, Cu- 64, Ga- 68, Y- 86, and I- 124) commonly used to label various probes for small animal PET imaging. The MCNPX radiation transport code was used for radiation dose calculations. For most source/target organ pairs, O- 15 and Ga- 68 produce the highest self-absorbed <b>S</b> <b>values</b> {{because of the high}}-energy and high-frequency of positron emissions, while Y- 86 produces the highest cross-absorbed <b>S</b> <b>values</b> because of the high energy and high frequency of gamma-rays emission. Anatomical models produced from different rat strains or modeling techniques exhibit different organ masses, volumes, and thus give rise to different <b>S</b> <b>values</b> and absorbed dose. The variations of absorbed fractions between models of the same type are less than those between models with different types. The calculated <b>S</b> <b>values</b> depend strongly on organ mass, and as such, different models produce similar <b>S</b> <b>values</b> for organs of comparable masses. In most source organs presenting with high cumulated activity, the absorbed dose is less affected by model difference compared with other organs. The produced <b>S</b> <b>values</b> for common positron-emitting radionuclides can be exploited in the assessment of radiation dose to rats from different radiotracers used in small animal PET experiments.

As for orogenic gold deposits worldwide, most deposits have positive means and a restricted range of δ 34 <b>S</b> <b>values,</b> but some have negative means and wider ranges of δ 34 <b>S</b> <b>values.</b> Wall-rock carbonation and back-mixing of similar-source fluids with different fluid pathways can {{explain some of}} the more negative δ 34 S signatures. However, structural setting appears {{to be the most important}} factor controlling ore-fluid oxidation state and hence the distribution of δ 34 <b>S</b> <b>values</b> in gold-related pyrites. Shear-hosted deposits appear to have experienced fluid-dominated processes such as phase separation, whereas stockwork, vein-hosted or disseminated deposits formed under conditions of greater rock buffering. At Victory-Defiance, in particular, negative δ 34 <b>S</b> <b>values</b> are more common in gently dipping dilational structures, compared to more compressional steeply dipping structures. It appears most likely that fluid-pressure fluctuations during fault-valve cycles establish different fluid-flow regimes in structures with different orientations. Rapid fluid-pressure fluctuations in dilational structures during seismic activity can cause partitioning of reduced gas phases from the ore fluid during extreme phase separation and hence are an effective method of ore-fluid oxidation, leading to large, local fluctuations in oxidation state. It is thus not necessary to invoke mixing with oxidised magmatic fluids to explain δ 34 S signatures indicative of oxidation. In any case, available, robust geochronology in the Eastern Goldfields Province does not support the direct involvement of oxidised magmatic fluids from adjacent granitic intrusions in orogenic gold genesis. Thus, negative mean δ 34 <b>S</b> <b>values</b> and large variations in δ 34 <b>S</b> <b>values</b> of ore-related pyrites in world-class orogenic gold deposits are interpreted to result from multiple mechanisms of gold precipitation from a single, ubiquitous ore fluid in varying structural settings, rather than from the involvement of oxidised ore fluids from a different source.
