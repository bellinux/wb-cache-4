40|$|Invasive {{long-term}} EEG {{investigations of}} the insula have been performed since the mid-nineties in an expanding range of focal epilepsies suspected to involve the insular cortex. The various clinical forms of insular epilepsies were delineated during the last 2 decades, and include the following presentations: perisylvian epilepsy, temporal plus epilepsy, sleep hypermotor epilepsy, MRI-negative frontal and parietal lobe epilepsies, and insular lesions. In fact, a majority of complex <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> procedures will include at least one electrode targeting the insula. <b>Stereoelectroencephalography</b> is currently the preferred method to investigate the insula, using orthogonal, oblique, {{or a combination of}} both trajectories, with no evidence of higher risk of intracranial bleeding than in other brain regions. Orthogonal trajectories allow to sample the overlaying opercula, while oblique trajectories offer a better sampling of the insular cortex. Intrainsular ictal EEG pattern are often characterized by a prolonged focal discharge restricted to one of the five insular gyri, militating for a dense enough sampling of the insular cortex in suspected insular epilepsies. <b>Stereoelectroencephalography</b> offers the potential to perform thermolesion of insular epileptogenic zones which, together with MRI-guided laser ablation, represent a possibly safer alternative treatment to open-skull surgical resection of the insula...|$|E

Few studies describe the in vivo quantitative accuracy of neuronavigation in patients. The use of a frameless stereotactic drilling technique for <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> depth electrode implantation in epilepsy patients, as well as diagnostic biopsies, provides {{a unique opportunity to}} assess the accuracy with postoperative imaging of preoperatively planned trajectories.

40|$|Abstract — Epilepsy is a {{neurological}} disorder that affects {{tens of millions}} of people every year and is characterized by sudden-onset seizures which are often associated with physical convulsions. Effective treatment and management of epilepsy would be greatly improved if convulsions could be caught quickly through early seizure detection. However, this is still a largely open problem due to the challenge of finding a robust statistic from the neural measurements. This paper suggests a new multivariate statistic by combining spectral techniques with matrix theory. Specifically, <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG) data was used to generate a series of coherence connectivity matrices which were then examined using singular value decomposition. Tracking the relative angles of the first singular vectors generated from this data provides an effective way of defining the most dominant characteristics of the SEEG during the normal, the pre-ictal, and the ictal states. This paper indicates that the first singular vector has a characteristic direction indicative of the seizure state and illustrates a data analysis method that incorporates all neural data as opposed to a small selection of channels.

40|$|International audienceDuring the pre-surgical {{evaluation}} of drug-resistant epilepsy, {{the assessment of}} the extent of the epileptogenic zone and its organization is a crucial objective. Indeed, the epileptogenic zone may be organized as a simple focal lesional site or as a more complex network (often referred to as the 'epileptogenic network') extending beyond the lesion. This distinction is particularly relevant in developmental lesions such as focal cortical dysplasias or dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours and may determine both the surgical strategy and the prognosis. In this study, we have quantified the epileptogenic characteristic of brain structures explored by depth electrodes in 36 patients investigated by <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> and suffering from focal drug-resistant epilepsy associated with focal cortical dysplasias or dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours. This quantification was performed using the 'Epileptogenicity Index' method that accounts for both the propensity of a brain area to generate rapid discharges and the time for this area {{to get involved in the}} seizure. Epileptogenicity Index values range from 0 (no epileptogenicity) to 1 (maximal epileptogenicity). We determined Epileptogenicity Index from signals recorded in distinct brain structures including the lesional site. We studied the type of epileptogenic zone organization (focal versus network) and looked for a correlation with clinical data and post-surgical outcome. Mean Epileptogenicity Index in lesional regions was 0. 87 (+/- 0. 25), and 0. 29 (+/- 0. 30) in 'non-lesional' structures. The number of highly epileptogenic structures (defined by Epileptogenicity Index value >or= 0. 4) was 3. 14 (+/- 1. 87) in the whole population. We found that 31 % of patients had only one epileptogenic structure (N(EI>or= 0. 4) = 1), therefore disclosing a strictly focal epileptogenic zone organization while 25 patients had more than one epileptogenic region, disclosing a network (61 %) or bilateral (8 %) epileptogenic zone organization. We observed a trend for a difference in seizure outcome according to the type of epileptogenic zone organization. Indeed, 57 % of patients with network organization and 87 % with focal organization were seizure-free while none of those with bilateral organization became seizure-free. The determination of Epileptogenicity Index computed from electrophysiological signals recorded according to the <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> technique is a novel tool. Results suggest that it can help in the delineation of the epileptogenic zone associated with brain lesions and that it could be used in the definition of the subsequent surgical resection...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: <b>Stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG) and {{subdural}} grids (SDG) {{are both}} effective options for localizing the ictal onset zone {{in patients with}} frequent seizures. The choice of intracranial monitoring technique utilized depends upon several factors, including the patient's clinical presentation and history. This article addresses a rare instance in which SEEG {{was not an option}} due to patient's morphology. Case report A 36 -year-old man with history of medically intractable epilepsy and multiple craniotomies complicated by infection and subsequent cranioplasty was presented for possible surgical evaluation. Initially, SEEG was attempted but ultimately terminated because of difficulty related to prior cranioplasty and scarring to the brain. Eventually, a subdural grid system was placed to establish the patient's ictal onset zones after which RNS implantation was performed. Discussion: The SDG placement was successful and localized the patient's ictal onset to the hand-motor region of the left hemisphere. RNS was then implanted and postoperatively the patient had a significant decrease in his seizure burden. Conclusion: The case illustrates a possible limitation of SEEG placement, particularly in patients with a history of cranioplasty and multiple prior craniotomies. We also describe the first placement of an RNS generator and system in the setting of prior cranioplasty...|$|E

With the aim of better characterizing the underlying networks of motor seizures, we quantitatively studied the "epileptogenicity" of brain structures in 28 patients investigated by intracerebral recordings (<b>stereoelectroencephalography,</b> SEEG). Epileptogenicity of various motor regions (rolandic, SMA, pre-SMA, cingulate motor area (CMA), lateral area 6) as well as prefrontal and parietal areas, was calculated according to the "epileptogenicity index" (EI), a technique that allows mathematical quantification of rapid discharges at seizure onset. According to the maximal value of EI five groups of patients were identified: precentral, premotor/precentral, mesial premotor, lateral premotor and mesio-lateral premotor groups. Most patients disclosed a complex pattern of motor/premotor involvement, while pure mesial premotor seizures ("SMA seizures") were rare. A positive correlation {{between the number of}} structures exhibiting high EI and epilepsy duration was found, as well as a relationship between high EI values in rolandic cortex and poorer surgical outcome.

Invasive recordings (<b>stereoelectroencephalography)</b> were also performed. Results:In both patients ictal semiology was characterized by very stereotyped repetitive right arm movements, i. e. tapping towards the thorax (movement rate of 6 – 7 Hz and 3 – 4 Hz for the two subjects, respectively). Seizures in the first patient, whose epilepsy was cryptogenetic, originated from the right pre-SMA area, which was surgically removed. She is seizure free 2 years after the operation.

We studied 194 seizures from 29 consecutive patients presenting with OLE and investigated by <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG). Epileptogenicity of occipital and extraoccipital regions was quantified according to the `epileptogenicity index' (El) method. We found that 79 % of patients showed widespread epileptogenic zone organization, involving parietal or temporal regions {{in addition to the}} occipital lobe. Two main groups of epileptogenic zone organization within occipital lobe seizures were identified: a pure occipital group and an occipital ``plus'' group, the latter including two further subgroups, occipitotemporal and occipitoparietal. In 29 % of patients, the epileptogenic zone was found to have a bilateral organization. The most epileptogenic structure was the fusiform gyrus (mean EI: 0. 53). Surgery was proposed in 18 / 29 patients, leading to seizure freedom in 55 % (Engel Class I).

METHODS: <b>Stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG) was performed in a man with BPNH and refractory epilepsy {{to investigate}} the hypothesis of right temporal lobe epilepsy and the possible involvement of heterotopic structures during seizures. SEEG signals were analyzed with quantification of functional coupling between different brain structures during seizures, using nonlinear regression. We have used Z-score transformation of correlation values to reflect the change from the preictal period. Relationships between BPNH and cortical structures were investigated using analysis of stimulation-induced potentials. RESULTS: Three spontaneous seizures were recorded and analyzed. Signal analysis of interdependencies in two seizures demonstrated a large initial network involving both heterotopia and cortical structures. Stimulations of heterotopia induced responses in remote cortical structures. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct epileptogenic networks were identified, in which leader structures were either the heterotopic or the mesial temporal structures, with functional connections between heterotopic and cortical areas. SIGNIFICANCE: These results confirm that a vast epileptogenic network, including heterotopic and cortical neurons, {{may be responsible for}} seizure generation in BPNH.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG) is an {{invasive}} diagnostic pro-cedure in epilepsy {{surgery that}} is usually implemented with frame-based methods. OBJECTIVE: To describe a new technique of frameless SEEG and report a prospective case series at a single center. METHODS: Image integration and planning of electrode trajectories were performed preoperatively on specialized software and exported to a Medtronic S 7 StealthStation. Trajectories were implemented by frameless stereotaxy using percutaneous drilling and bolt insertion. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients went this technique, with the insertion of 187 intra-cerebral electrodes. Of 187 electrodes, 175 accurately reached their neurophysiological target, as measured by postoperative computed tomography reconstruction and multimodal image integration with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Four electrodes failed to hit their target due to extradural deflection, and 3 were sub-sequently resited satisfactorily. Eight electrodes were off target by a mean of 3. 6 mm (range, 0. 9 - 6. 8 mm) due {{to a combination of}} errors in bolt trajectory implementation and bending of the electrode. There was 1 postoperative hemorrhage that was clinically asymptomatic and no postoperative infections.

40|$|<b>Stereoelectroencephalography</b> (depth-EEG signals) is a presurgical {{investigation}} {{technique of}} drug-resistant partial epilepsy, in which multiple sensor intracerebral electrodes {{are used to}} directly record brain electrical activity. In order to interpret depth-EEG signals, we developed an extended source model which connects two levels of representation: (1) a distributed current dipole model which describes the spatial distribution of neuronal sources; (2) a model of coupled neuronal populations which describes their temporal dynamics. From this extended source model, depth-EEG signals were simulated from the forward solution at each electrode sensor located inside the brain. Results showed that realistic transient epileptiform activities (spikes) are obtained under specific conditions in the model in terms of degree of coupling between neuronal populations and spatial extent of the source. In particular, the cortical area involved in the generation of epileptic spikes was estimated to vary from 18 to 25 cm 2, for brain conductivity values ranging from 30 to 35 x 10 (- 5) S/mm, for high coupling degree between neuronal populations and for a volume conductor model that accounts for the three main tissues of the head (brain, skull, and scalp).

40|$|International audienceChanges in {{sensorimotor}} rhythms (mu, beta and gamma) and movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) {{are both}} generated principally by the contralateral sensorimotor areas during {{the execution of}} self-paced movement. They appear to reflect movement control mechanisms, which remain partially unclear. With the aim of better understanding their sources and significance, we recorded MRCPs and sensorimotor rhythms during and after self-paced movement using intracerebral electrodes in eight epileptic subjects investigated by <b>stereoelectroencephalography.</b> The results showed that: (i) {{there is a strong}} spatial relationship between the late components of movement [...] the so-called motor potential (MP) and post-movement complex (PMc) [...] and gamma event-related synchronization (ERS) within the 40 - 60 Hz band, as the MP/PMc always occurred in contacts displaying gamma ERS (the primary sensorimotor areas), whereas mu and beta reactivities were more diffuse; and (ii) MPs and PMc are both generated by the primary motor and somatosensory areas, but with distinct sources. Hence, this could mean that kinesthesic sensory afferences project to neurons other than those firing during the pyramidal tract volley. The PMc and low gamma ERS represent two electrophysiological facets of kinesthesic feedback from the joints and muscles involved in the movement to the sensorimotor cortex. It could be suggested that gamma oscillations within the 40 - 60 Hz band could serve to synchronize the activities of the various neuronal populations involved in control of the ongoing movement...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{anatomical}} {{and functional}} model of drug-resistant partial seizures is presented and discussed {{based on research}} conducted by our team over the last decade. This research {{is based on the}} study of intracerebral <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG) recordings in an attempt to identify the neural networks involved in generating paroxystic activities so as to understand their dynamics in space and time, and to propose targeted therapies that could "control" these networks. Today, the classical notion of epileptic focus should be replaced by a more complex model that takes into account the potential interactions within the neuronal networks involved in seizures. During partial epileptic seizures, the cerebral structures involved are the seat of characteristic oscillations that may be synchronized or, on the contrary, that can desynchronize in a transitory manner. These epileptic rhythms disturb the physiological rhythms that underlie the cognitive and emotional processes, which can thus be altered in partial epilepsy, even if located far from the original discharge site. We suggest that seizures originate in a group of structures that are highly epileptogenic (epileptogenic zone network, [EZN]) whose activity is synchronized before the appearance of fast oscillations that are transitorily desynchronized. Later, other cortical and subcortical structures are the seat of slower, synchronized rhythmic modifications (propagation network, [PN]). The emergence of clinical signs in the seizure depend on these phenomena, which in some cases can mimic a normal cognitive process or, on the contrary, lead to a deep rupture in normal cerebral functioning...|$|E

For years, {{the relationship between the}} interictal epileptic spikes (defining the “irritative zone”, IZ) and the sites of seizure initiation (SOZ) has been a matter of debate. Methods Our goal was to investigate from intracerebral recordings (<b>stereoelectroencephalography,</b> SEEG) the distribution of interictal epileptic spikes (based on a spike frequency index, SI) and the topography of the SOZ (based on the Epileptogenicity Index, EI) in patients having focal neocortical epilepsies. Thirty one patients were studied. A total of 539 brain regions were quantified in term of both spike generation (SI) and seizure initiation (EI). Results We found a 56 % (18 / 32) rate of agreement between maximal EI and maximal SI values. When considering separately patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), the proportion of patients with good concordance was ∼ 75 % (15 / 20), whereas it was only 33 % (4 / 12) in the non FCD group. Conclusions Our results show that a significant part of patients have some dissociation between regions showing pronounced spiking activity and those showing high epileptogenicity. e is clinically important.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the validity of}} scalp-electroencephalography (EEG) -interictal spike (IIS) source localization in posterior cortex epilepsies (PCE). METHODS: Eleven patients with drug-resistant PCE were studied with high-resolution EEG (HR-EEG) and <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG). Sixty-four scalp channels, a realistic head model, and different algorithms [multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and equivalent current dipoles] were used. Results were compared to intracerebral SEEG recordings. For SEEG, a semiautomatic detection of intracerebral IIS was used, allowing a classification of intracerebral IIS into one of three groups: Medial, lateral, and mediolateral. RESULTS: In the medial group (two patients), scalp-EEG IIS were usually absent for one patient whereas for the other, scalp-EEG was misleading. Indeed, scalp-EEG IIS had a posterior projection, predominantly contralateral to the source. In the lateral group (two patients), scalp-EEG IIS were subcontinuous and accurately localized. In the mediolateral group (seven patients), intracerebral interictal distribution was complex and bilateral for four of seven patients. Source localizations were able to determine only a part, whether lateral or medial, of the intracerebral interictal distribution. DISCUSSION: The accuracy of scalp-EEG IIS source localization is dependant {{on the type of}} intracerebral interictal distribution. In the most frequent type of PCE, patients proved to have a complex interictal distribution between both medial and lateral cortices, and source localizations always underestimated intracerebral IIS. In cases where intracranial sources were quite focal, surface EEG sources were localized with accuracy, even in medial occipital lobe structures...|$|E

OBJECTIVE:To report a retrospective observational study of insular exploration using <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> (sEEG) with transopercular and parasagittal oblique intracerebral electrodes from January 2008 to January 2016. The first {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the surgical risks of insular cortex sEEG exploration. The second purpose was to define the ability of placing intracerebral contacts in the whole insular cortex. METHODS:Ninety-nine patients underwent 108 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -guided stereotactic implantations of intracerebral electrodes in the context of preoperative assessment of drug-resistant epilepsy, including at least 1 electrode placed in the insular cortex. On postoperative computed tomography images co-registered with MRI, followed by MRI segmentation and application of a transformation matrix, intracerebral contact coordinates of the insular electrodes' contacts were anatomically localized in the Talairach space. Finally, dispersion and clustering analysis was performed. RESULTS:There was no morbidity, in particular hemorrhagic complications, or mortality related to insular electrodes. Statistical comparison of intracerebral contact positions demonstrated that whole insula exploration is possible on the left and right sides. In addition, the clustering analysis showed the homogeneous distribution of the electrodes within the insular cortex. CONCLUSION:In the presurgical evaluation of drug-resistant epilepsy, the insular cortex can be explored safely and comprehensively using transopercular sEEG electrodes.

40|$|OBJECTIVE The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{accuracy}} of Neurolocate frameless registration system and frame-based registration for robotic <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG). METHODS The authors performed a 40 -trajectory phantom laboratory study and a 127 -trajectory retrospective analysis of a surgical series. The laboratory study was aimed at testing the noninferiority of the Neurolocate system. The analysis of the surgical series compared Neurolocate-based SEEG implantations with a frame-based historical control group. RESULTS The mean localization errors (LE) ± standard deviations (SD) for Neurolocate-based and frame-based trajectories were 0. 67 ± 0. 29 mm and 0. 76 ± 0. 34 mm, respectively, in the phantom study (p = 0. 35). The median entry point LE was 0. 59 mm (interquartile range [IQR] 0. 25 - 0. 88 mm) for Neurolocate-registration-based trajectories and 0. 78 mm (IQR 0. 49 - 1. 08 mm) for frame-registration-based trajectories (p = 0. 00002) in the clinical study. The median target point LE was 1. 49 mm (IQR 1. 06 - 2. 4 mm) for Neurolocate-registration-based trajectories and 1. 77 mm (IQR 1. 25 - 2. 5 mm) for frameregistration- based trajectories in the clinical study. All the surgical procedures were successful and uneventful. CONCLUSIONS The results of the phantom study demonstrate the noninferiority of Neurolocate frameless registration. The results of the retrospective surgical series analysis suggest that Neurolocate-based procedures can be more accurate than the frame-based ones. The safety profile of Neurolocate-based registration should be similar to that of frame-based registration. The Neurolocate system is comfortable, noninvasive, easy to use, and potentially faster than other registration devices...|$|E

In contrast, the ictal semiology in children with insular epilepsy is poorly described. Considering that early and successful surgery may greatly improve the cognitive outcome and quality of life, it is worthwhile to deepen our knowledge of insular epilepsy in children. MethodsWe retrospectively evaluated ten children with drug-resistant focal insular epilepsy who had been consecutively explored with <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG), followed by individually tailored resective surgery that included part of the insula in all cases. A detailed anatomo-electro-clinical analysis of non-invasive EEG and SEEG data was performed. At {{least one of the}} electrodes explored the insular cortex. SEEG analysis confirmed that the insular cortex was included in the ictal onset zone. ResultsEpilepsy onset was mostly {{during the first year of}} life, characterized by subtle seizures as well as spasms and myoclonic seizures. Later on, neurovegetative signs and asymmetric tonic and hypermotor seizures (HMS) dominated the ictal semiology. The epileptogenic zone was frequently wider than insular with frontal and central predominance. In eight patients, the tailored resection included a lesion. In seven patients, an Engel class 1 outcome as well as neuropsychological and behavioural improvement was obtained. ConclusionsSEEG is feasible and useful in children with drug-resistant insular epilepsy which is often characterized by autonomic symptoms as the initial symptoms and should be suspected in cases with HMS, asymmetric tonic seizures and even asymmetric spasms. Early propagation is mostly frontal and central. Analysis of a larger population is required to refine these findings...|$|E

In this work, a new special purpose reconstruction algorithm for EIT is presented and validated wth experimental measurements performed on a cylindrical phantom and on a simulated human head. The algorithm focuses on the quick detection of compact conductivity contrasts in imperfectly known in 3 D domains. The performance of the proposed algorithm is then compared to the one of a benchmark reconstruction method in the EIT field, Tikhonov regularized reconstruction, with stroke detection and classification as a case study. Moreover, the possible application of EIT imaging to the detection of epileptic foci with intracranial deep electrodes (<b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> or SEEG) is explored. Finally, EEG source reconstruction algorithms are implemented on a heterogeneous multi-CPU and multi-GPU computing system to significantly reduce the reconstruction time...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: We {{aimed to}} (1) assess the {{concordance}} between various polymicrogyria (PMG) types {{and the associated}} epileptogenic zone (EZ), as defined by <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG), and (2) determine the postsurgical seizure outcome in PMG-related drug-resistant epilepsy. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 58 cases: 49 had SEEG and 39 corticectomy or hemispherotomy. RESULTS: Mean age at SEEG or surgery was 28. 3 years (range, 2 - 50). PMG was bilateral in 9 (16 %) patients and unilateral in 49, including 17 (29 %) unilobar, 12 (21 %) multilobar, 15 (26 %) perisylvian, and only 5 (9 %) hemispheric. Twenty-eight (48 %) patients additionally had schizencephaly, heterotopia, or focal cortical dysplasia. The SEEG-determined EZ was fully concordant with the PMG in only 8 (16 %) cases, partially concordant in 74 %, and discordant in 10 %. The EZ included remote cortical areas in 21 (43 %) cases and was primarily localized in those in 5 (10 %), all related to the mesial temporal structures. All but 1 PMG patient with corticectomy or hemispherotomy had a unilateral PMG. At last follow-up (mean, 4. 6 years; range, 1 - 16), 28 (72 %) patients remained seizure free. Shorter epilepsy duration to surgery was an independent predictor of seizure freedom. INTERPRETATION: PMG-related drug-resistant epilepsy warrants a comprehensive presurgical evaluation, including SEEG investigations in most cases, given that the EZ may only partially overlap with the PMG or include solely remote cortical areas. Seizure freedom is feasible in {{a large proportion of}} patients. PMG extent should not deter from exploring the possibility of epilepsy surgery. Our data support the early consideration of epilepsy surgery in this patient group. Ann Neurol 2017; 82 : 781 - 794...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjectiveLoss of {{consciousness}} (LOC) in frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) has been rarely specifically studied until now. In {{this study we}} evaluated the LOC in a population of patients with FLE and studied the relationship between changes in synchrony and degree of LOC. Methods 24 patients undergoing <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG) during pre-surgical evaluation of FLE were studied. The LOC intensity was scored using the Consciousness Seizure Scale (CSS). For each studied seizure (n = 52), interdependencies between signals recorded from 5 brain regions were estimated {{as a function of}} time by using non-linear regression analysis (h 2 coefficient). ResultsSeizures were divided into 3 groups according to the CSS scale: group A (no LOC) with a score ⩽ 2, group B (intermediate or partial LOC) with a score ranging from 3 to 5, and group C (maximal LOC) with a score ⩾ 6. The majority of seizures in FLE patients disclosed significant LOC, particularly for patients with prefrontal lobe seizures. Mean correlation values were significantly different between groups A and C (p < 0. 001), the maximal values of synchrony being observed in group C. Differences were significant for interaction affecting the external prefrontal cortex (p = 0. 004) (p = 0. 01) and the parietal cortex. In addition, a significant correlation was found between CSS scores and correlations values (h 2) of the prefrontal and the parietal region but not with the premotor cortex. ConclusionsThis study indicates that in FLE, prefrontal seizures frequently alter consciousness. As in other focal seizures, LOC appears to be related to changes in synchrony in prefrontal and parietal associative cortices...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjectives: The {{study of}} {{intracerebral}} electroencephalography (EEG) seizure-onset patterns {{is crucial to}} accurately define the epileptogenic zone and guide successful surgical resection. It also raises important pathophysiologic issues concerning mechanisms of seizure generation. Until now, several seizure-onset patterns have been described using distinct recording methods (subdural, depth electrode), mostly in temporal lobe epilepsies or with heterogeneous neocortical lesions. Methods: We analyzed data from a cohort of 53 consecutive patients explored by <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG) and with pathologically confirmed malformation of cortical development (MCD; including focal cortical dysplasia [FCD] and neurodevelopmental tumors [NDTs]). Results: We identified six seizure-onset patterns using visual and time-frequency analysis: low-voltage fast activity (LVFA); preictal spiking followed by LVFA; burst of polyspikes followed by LVFA; slow wave/DC shift followed by LVFA; theta/alpha sharp waves; and rhythmic spikes/spike-waves. We found a high prevalence of patterns that included LVFA (83 %), indicating nevertheless that LVFA is not a constant characteristic of seizure onset. An association between seizure-onset patterns and histologic types was found (p = 001). The more prevalent patterns were as follows: (1) in FCD type I LVFA (23. 1 %) and slow wave/baseline shift followed by LVFA (15. 4 %); (2) in FCD type II burst of polyspikes followed by LVFA (31 %), LVFA (27. 6 %), and preictal spiking followed by LVFA (27. 6 %); (3) in NDT, LVFA (54. 5 %). We found that a seizure-onset pattern that included LVFA was associated with favorable postsurgical outcome, but the completeness of the EZ resection was the sole independent predictive variable. Significance: Six different seizure-onset patterns {{can be described in}} FCD and NDT. Better postsurgical outcome is associated with patterns that incorporate LVFA...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Loss of {{consciousness}} (LOC) in epileptic seizures has a strongly {{negative impact on}} quality of life. Recently, we showed that LOC occurring during temporal lobe seizures was correlated with a nonlinear increase of neural synchrony in associative [...] and particularly parietal [...] cortices. Whether these mechanisms might be observed in other types of seizures is unknown. This study aimed at investigating the relationship between changes in synchrony and degree of LOC during parietal lobe epilepsy (PLE), a form of epilepsy in which seizures directly involve the parietal associative cortices. METHODS: Ten patients undergoing <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG) during presurgical evaluation of PLE were studied. The LOC intensity was scored using the Conscious Seizure Scale (CSS). For each studied seizure (n = 29), interdependencies between signals recorded from six brain regions were estimated {{as a function of}} time by using nonlinear regression analysis (h(2) coefficient). KEY FINDINGS: Seizures were divided into three groups according to the CSS scale: group A (no LOC) with a score ≤ 1, group B (intermediate or partial LOC) with a score ranging from 2 to 5, and group C (maximal LOC) with a score ≥ 6. The majority of seizures in patients with PLE disclosed significant LOC (17 / 29, group C). Mean h(2) values were significantly different between the three groups (p = 0. 008), the maximal values of synchrony being observed in group C. In addition, a statistically significant nonlinear relationship (p = 0. 0021) was found between the h(2) values and the CSS scores, suggesting a threshold effect. SIGNIFICANCE: This study indicates that excess of EEG signal synchrony within associative cortices {{is likely to be a}} crucial phenomenon associated with LOC...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEpileptogenic {{networks}} {{are defined by}} the brain regions involved in the production and propagation of epileptic activities. In this review we describe the historical, methodologic, and conceptual bases of this model {{in the analysis of}} electrophysiologic intracerebral recordings. In the context of epilepsy surgery, the determination of cerebral regions producing seizures (i. e., the “epileptogenic zone”) is a crucial objective. In contrast with a traditional focal vision of focal drug-resistant epilepsies, the concept of epileptogenic networks has been progressively introduced as a model better able to describe the complexity of seizure dynamics and realistically describe the distribution of epileptogenic anomalies in the brain. The concept of epileptogenic networks is historically linked {{to the development of the}} <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG) method and subsequent introduction of means of quantifying the recorded signals. Seizures, and preictal and interictal discharges produce clear patterns on SEEG. These patterns can be analyzed utilizing signal analysis methods that quantify high-frequency oscillations or changes in functional connectivity. Dramatic changes in SEEG brain connectivity can be described during seizure genesis and propagation within cortical and subcortical regions, associated with the production of different patterns of seizure semiology. The interictal state is characterized by networks generating abnormal activities (interictal spikes) and also by modified functional properties. The introduction of novel approaches to large-scale modeling of these networks offers new methods in the goal of better predicting the effects of epilepsy surgery. The epileptogenic network concept is a key factor in identifying the anatomic distribution of the epileptogenic process, which is particularly important in the context of epilepsy surgery. © 2017 The Authors.

40|$|Drug {{resistant}} focal epilepsy can {{be treated}} by resecting the epileptic focus requiring a precise focus localization using <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG) probes. As commercial SEEG probes offer only a limited spatial resolution, probes of higher channel count and design freedom enabling the incorporation of macro and microelectrodes would help increasing spatial resolution and thus open new perspectives for investigating mechanisms underlying focal epilepsy and its treatment. This work describes a new fabrication process for SEEG probes with materials and dimensions similar to clinical probes enabling recording single neuron activity at high spatial resolution. Polyimide {{is used as a}} biocompatible flexible substrate into which platinum electrodes and leads are [...] . The resulting probe features match those of clinically approved devices. Tests in saline solution confirmed the probe stability and functionality. Probes were implanted into the brain of one monkey (Macaca mulatta), trained to perform different motor tasks. Suitable configurations including up to 128 electrode sites allow the recording of task-related neuronal signals. Probes with 32 and 64 electrode sites were implanted in the posterior parietal cortex. Local field potentials and multi-unit activity were recorded as early as one hour after implantation. Stable single-unit activity was achieved for up to 26 days after implantation of a 64 -channel probe. All recorded signals showed modulation during task execution. With the novel probes it is possible to record stable biologically relevant data over a time span exceeding the usual time needed for epileptic focus localization in human patients. This {{is the first time that}} single units are recorded along cylindrical polyimide probes chronically implanted 22 mm deep into the brain of a monkey, which suggests the potential usefulness of this probe for human applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} underlying seizure termination {{are still}} unclear despite their therapeutic importance. We studied thalamo-cortical connectivity and synchrony in human mesial temporal lobe seizures {{in order to}} analyze their role in seizure termination. Twenty-two seizures from ten patients with drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy undergoing pre-surgical evaluation were analyzed using intracerebral recordings (<b>stereoelectroencephalography,</b> SEEG). We performed a measure of SEEG signal interdependencies (non-linear correlation), to estimate the functional connectivity between thalamus and cortical regions. Then we derived synchronization indices, namely global, thalamic, mesio-temporal and thalamo-mesio temporal index at the onset {{and the end of}} seizures. In addition, an estimation of thalamic outputs and inputs connectivity was proposed. Thalamus was consistently involved in the last phase of all analyzed seizures and thalamic synchronization index was significantly more elevated at the end of seizure than at the onset. The global synchronization index at the end of seizure negatively correlated with seizure duration (p= 0. 045) and in the same way the thalamic synchronization index showed an inverse tendency with seizure duration. Six seizures out of twenty-two displayed a particular thalamo-cortical spike and wave pattern (SWP) at the end. They were associated to higher values of all synchronization indices and outputs from thalamus (p = 0. 0079). SWP seizures displayed a higher and sustained increase of cortical and thalamo-cortical synchronization with a stronger participation of thalamic outputs. We suggest that thalamo-cortical oscillations might contribute to seizure termination via modulation of cortical synchronization. In the subgroup of SWP seizures thalamus may exert a control on temporal lobe structures by inducing a stable hypersynchronization that ultimately leads to seizure termination...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInterictal or ictal {{events in}} partial epilepsies may project on scalp EEG contralaterally {{to the side}} of the {{epileptogenic}} lesion. Such paradoxical lateralization can be observed in case of para-sagittal generators, and is likely due to the spatial orientation of the generator, presenting an oblique projection towards the midline. We present here a case of medial occipital epilepsy investigated using EEG, MEG and <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG). MRI displayed a focal cortical dysplasia in the superior margin of the right calcarine fissure. SEEG demonstrated bilateral medial occipital interictal spikes, with an inversion of polarity at the level of the lesion and a contralateral propagation occurring in 10  ms. Interictal iterative EEG cartographies showed a large posterior field, with a maximum contralateral to the initial generator (EEG paradoxical lateralization). With the same number of channels, interictal iterative MEG cartographies were more precise and more complex than EEG ones, indicating an onset accurately lateralized. A few milliseconds later, MEG cartographies were quadripolar, thus indicating two homotopic active generators. These MEG and EEG cartographies have been reproduced using BESA dipole simulator. Relative merits of MEG and EEG are still debated. With 151 channels, MEG source localizations indicated the right medial occipital area, as demonstrated by SEEG. An investigation with a corresponding number of EEG channels was not performed. After a down sampling to 64 sensors, this precision was lost. MEG and EEG source localization results, both with 64 channels, were quite comparable, indicating both medial occipital areas. However, a careful analysis of MEG/EEG iterative cartographies, performed with the same number of channels in both modalities, demonstrated that, in this configuration, MEG sensitivity was superior to the EEG one, allowing separating two medial occipital sources, characterized in SEEG by a time delay of 10  ms...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHigh {{resolution}} electroencephalography (HR-EEG) {{combined with}} source localization methods has mainly {{been used to}} study interictal spikes {{and there have been}} few studies comparing source localization of scalp ictal patterns with depth EEG. To address this issue, 10 patients with four different scalp ictal patterns (ictal spikes, rhythmic activity, paroxysmal fast activity, obscured) were investigated by both HR-EEG and <b>stereoelectroencephalography</b> (SEEG). Sixty-four scalp-EEG sensors and a sampling rate of 1 kHz were used to record scalp ictal patterns. Five different source models (moving dipole, rotating dipole, MUSIC, LORETA, and sLORETA) were used in order to perform source localization. Seven to 10 intracerebral electrodes were implanted during SEEG investigations. For each source model, the concordance between ictal source localization and epileptogenic zone defined by SEEG was assessed. Results were considered to agree if they localized in the same sublobar area as defined by a trained epileptologist. Across the study population, the best concordance between source localization methods and SEEG (9 / 10) was obtained with equivalent current dipole modeling. MUSIC and LORETA had a concordance of 7 / 10 whereas sLORETA had a concordance of only 5 / 10. Four of our patients classified into different groups (ictal spikes, paroxysmal fast activity, obscured) had complete concordance between source localization methods and SEEG. A high signal to noise ratio, a short time window of analysis (< 1 s) and bandpass filtering around the frequency of rhythmic activity allowed improvement of the source localization results. A high level of agreement between source localization methods and SEEG can be obtained for ictal spike patterns and for scalp-EEG paroxysmal fact activities whereas scalp rhythmic discharges can be accurately localized but originated from seizure propagation network...|$|E
