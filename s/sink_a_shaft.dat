"At any rate," [...] Mr. Gubbins said, [...] "we {{must begin}} {{at once to}} <b>sink</b> <b>a</b> <b>shaft.</b> If, when we get down a bit, we cannot judge as to the direction, we must drive two or three {{listening}} galleries in different directions. But before we begin we must let Major Anderson, of the Royal Engineers, know, and take his advice; he is in command of all mining operations." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{we went to}} work. We {{decided to}} <b>sink</b> <b>a</b> <b>shaft.</b> So, for a week we climbed the mountain, laden with picks, drills, gads, crowbars, shovels, cans of {{blasting}} powder and coils of fuse and strove with might and main. At first the rock was broken and loose and we dug it up with picks and threw it out with shovels, and the hole progressed very well. But the rock became more compact, presently, and gads and crowbars came into play. But shortly nothing could make an impression but blasting powder.|$|E

The two who are working the horses earn enough to keep the five of us, and if by any chance your claims should turn out well, we shall be paid for our work for you, and will be able to work out our own claims very cheaply; if we sunk a shaft on our own account we should similarly lose our labour if it turned out poor, and should not get so much if it turned out rich. So I think the bargain is really a fair one; and if you do not agree, my mates have quite resolved to <b>sink</b> <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> on their own account on the strength of your father's dream." ...|$|E

The Combination Shaft, {{located near}} Virginia City, began in 1875 when the mine owners {{combined}} {{their efforts to}} <b>sink</b> <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> to explore the Comstock Lode at a greater depth. The Combination was the deepest shaft ever sunk on the Comstock, reaching a depth of 3,250 feet. It was used until 1886.|$|E
50|$|By March 1874 the Raspberry Gully shaft had yet {{to strike}} the aimed for Borehole Seam of coal, so the {{directors}} of the Waratah Coal Company decided to <b>sink</b> <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> closer to existing working collieries where the seam was known to exist and was being worked. This shaft was adjacent to the route of the railway line being constructed to the Raspberry Gully mine, and was known as Stuart's Pit. Work on this colliery stopped soon after the Borehole seam was struck as the coal seam was only 0.431m thick.|$|E

50|$|Shafts can be sunk either dry or for {{methods such as}} the caisson method {{they can}} be sunk wet. <b>Sinking</b> <b>a</b> dry <b>shaft</b> means that any water that flows into the {{excavation}} is pumped out to leave no significant standing or flowing water {{in the base of}} the <b>shaft.</b> When wet <b>sinking</b> <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> the shaft is allowed to flood and the muck is excavated out of the base of the <b>shaft</b> underwater using <b>a</b> grab {{on the end of a}} crane or similar excavation method. Because the shaft is flooded, the lining can not be constructed at the excavation level of the shaft so this method only suits methods where the lining is installed before shaft sinking (such as the use of sheet piles) or where the lining is sunk down with the shaft such as the caisson method.|$|R

Grandfather didn't agree with the location of the spit and split with Desloge to form his own company," [...] Cantwell said. Desloge soon sank a shaft and struck the same main vein and deposits as that of those he had worked at Bonne Terre before the fire.|$|E
50|$|Overcoming the {{obstacles}} (thanks to Ennis) the McIntyre Mine {{went on to}} set {{a long list of}} firsts in mining and milling practices, as well as in health and safety. It was the first mine in Canada to have a metallurgist on the mill staff and employing a graduate engineer as mine superintendent. It was also the first in Canada to use rubber liners in milling and the first in the Porcupine camp to apply square-set and cut-and-fill stope mining. Gunitting was developed there it adapted and introduced flotation to gold milling. They were the first in Ontario to <b>sink</b> <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> to below 4,000 feet.|$|E
50|$|The {{mine was}} founded by the Hercules Company in Altenessen in 1855. It should not be {{confused}} with the Hercules mine in central Essen. They <b>sank</b> <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> equipped with <b>a</b> large-sized Malakow tower with two wings. The mine went operational in 1861. That same year Hercules was acquired by the Cologne Mining Association under Friedrich Grillo and was renamed the Zeche Carl.|$|R

50|$|There {{was once}} a number of mines within the parish. Rospeath mine closed (in circa) 1856 and made large returns for the investors. There was no adit and the mine only worked to 4.5 fathom m depth. The mine was reopened in December 1879 with an adit being cut, {{machinery}} erected to pump out the water and to <b>sink</b> <b>a</b> <b>shaft.</b> The width of the lode in the shaft is from 2+1/2 ft to 3 ft. The mine is bounded by Wheal Bolton on the west, Wheal Fortune on the east and to the south Wheal Darlington, Wheal Virgin and others known at the Marazion Mines.|$|E
50|$|Mining at Mungana {{commenced}} in 1893-1894 when John Moffat employed 70 men to prospect the Girofla load. Full scale operations commenced in 1896 when Moffat instructed 20 men to <b>sink</b> <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> at Girofla, {{prepare a}} dam and construct a smelter site. A calico township quickly grew near the mine, {{and was also}} called Girofla. The settlement soon expanded to include {{a small number of}} buildings, including three hotels. By 1897 the copper smelting machinery from Muldiva had been transferred to Girofla and the latter's population had grown to 158. Although the Girofla mine was principally a lead/silver producer, the smelter also processed other ore from a series of nearby mines associated with Moffat, including the Griffith, Dorothy, Red Dome and Lady Jane.|$|E
50|$|The Swetland Shaft {{was located}} on the {{northwest}} corner of the intersection of Vine and State streets in the Poke Hollow section of what is now Larksville Borough. According to court records, William Patten and Thomas Fender established this mine in 1851. About 1855, Patten and Fender contracted with an English immigrant, John Dennis (a future Plymouth burgess), to <b>sink</b> <b>a</b> <b>shaft</b> to the coal seams below. It was said to be the first mine shaft {{on the west side of}} the Susquehanna River. In January 1857, William Patten died when he fell down the newly constructed shaft. Fender continued to operate the mine, but on February 25, 1860, lost the property at sheriff's sale. Josiah W. Eno built a breaker at the mine in 1857, which he operated until 1861.|$|E

50|$|Galloway devised an {{improved}} walling cradle enabling two teams of workers {{to operate on}} different levels at the same time. He also devised a means of substituting the cages with water tanks to remove large quantities of water from flooded mines quickly. They became known as Galloway pneumatic tanks In 1875, he patented {{the idea of using}} twin guides or guide ropes for the kibble, allowing two kibbles to be used to <b>sink</b> <b>a</b> <b>shaft.</b> He also devised improved counterbalanced doors to cover the shaft top, speeding up operations and reducing the danger of injury to men, and damage to the shaft. He designed a steel bucket to carry the coal underground with wheels lubricated from hollow axle boxes and buffers, giving a smoother ride and lessening the amount of coal dust dropped on the road, and he also devised an engine small enough to be taken down in a cage and which could run along the tracks and be operated by compressed air, removing the need for pit ponies for hauling coal trucks. He installed a compressed air system using two engines to raise and lower equipment at Llanbradach colliery.|$|E
50|$|Developed as a safer {{alternative}} to dynamite, its manufacture and manipulation were {{claimed to be}} without danger as it required a very high temperature to ignite and, under ordinary circumstances be exploded by heat alone when unconfined.
