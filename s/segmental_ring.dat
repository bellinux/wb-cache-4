40|$|The {{segmental}} {{nature of}} the support system, the interaction mechanism between concrete-grout-soil and the complex installation process a bored tunnel are the main factors influencing the lining structural behavior. The main {{purpose of this study}} is to provide a two dimensional numerical model of segmental lining which takes into account the first two factors for the preliminary interpretation of the experimental data obtained by long-term monitoring of the strains in the instrumented segments of a precast <b>segmental</b> <b>ring</b> of Naples Metro Line 6. This model can be extended to three dimensions for a complete interpretation of monitoring data, including consideration of the tunnel excavation process...|$|E
40|$|Understanding t he {{behaviour}} {{of existing}} tunnels subjected to in - service deformations, {{as a result}} of the construction of underground works (e. g. new tunnel s) in their proximity, is of importance in order to safeguard infrastructure within the u r ban environment. The associated deformations that t ake place during tunnelling have to be carefully assessed and their impact on the existing tunnels need s to be considered. A half - scale segment al grey cast iron (GCI) tunnel lining ring was tested as part of an extensive research project investigating the impact of new tunnel excavations on existing tunnels conduc ted at Imperial College London. A sophisticated experimental arrangement was developed to deform the ring in a variety of modes under combined displacement and load control. This paper reports on experiments carried out to assess its structural response when subjected to large deformations. The test s reported are the first to be conducted on a realistic scale model under carefully controlled conditions, and provide valuable insight into the behavio ur of a G C I <b>segmental</b> <b>ring</b> during distortions commonly observed in reality. Details of the experiments, including the adopted test set - up and the instrumentation employed, are presented. The measured bending moments around the ring, {{as a result of}} the appl ied deformations, are determined and compared with th os e predict ed using the well - known equations given by Morgan (1961) and Muir Wood (1975), often used in industry, as well as those obtained assuming an elastic continuous ring...|$|E

40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The electrochemistry of porous, and planar zinc electrodes has been examined {{in connection with the}} application of zinc in electrochemical power sources. Planar, horizontal, upward-facing zinc electrodes have been galvanostatically oxidised in a convection-free system containing KOH under a series of different conditions. Many additives have been reported to increase T, but in the convection-free system no significant increase has been observed. Porous electrodes have been oxidised in the same system. The formation of duplex films has been confirmed optically, and the expansion of an oxidising electrode has been followed using a travelling microscope. A reaction plane parallel to the external surface has been observed penetrating the electrode. Rotating disc electrode experiments have been used to study the oxidation of zinc in a number of electrolytes. In NaC 104 semiconducting films were formed. In KOH a solution soluble region was identified. Linear sweep voltammograms were recorded in KOH, KOH containing polymaleic acid, and NaCl 04 /ZnBr 2 solutions. The techniques have been combined to show that the cathodic peak observed on reversing an anodic sweep in KOH is due to the reduction of soluble species from a Type I film, rather than reduction of a solid state film. The A. C. impedance of zinc in KOH, and in KOH with a carboxymethylcellulose, has been measured, and a theory proposed to explain the experimental results. A practical cell has been modelled. The current distribution along the porous zinc electrodes has been measured. Cadmium ring counter electrodes have been developed of greater recoverable charge capacity, and longer cycle life than the zinc electrode. These have been assembled in a 3 -tier stack with separators and zinc electrodes in the central cavity. This complex cell was cycled under electrolyte-starved conditions, and the current passing in each <b>segmental</b> <b>ring</b> has been measured, and the charge recoverable calculated. The differences between oxidative and reductive charge in each-cycle was attributed to zinc relocation. An electrode which only partially filled the cavity showed rapid shape-change. Electrodes that filled the cavity showed an expansion above the level of the rings during cycling, and ultimately failed due to oxygen evolution. The implications of these researches to contemporary porous zinc electrode technology are discussed...|$|E

5000|$|Work on {{the dock}} began in November 1930. The {{diversion}} of sewer, river embankment, and steel sheet pile cofferdam for construction of the new lock were all complete by May 1932. The embankment was constructed primarily of tipped chalk, faced on the seaward side with concrete blocks. Dock construction required excavation of approximately [...] of material, primarily by dragline excavator, much of which was used to fill {{other areas of the}} newly enclosed land. Spoil and slag from Scunthorpe was also used as fill on the reclaimed land. The new 45 ft lock was 240 ft long total with three gates. It was built on 12 in square timber piles, supporting a square bottomed concrete lock pit. 'Blows', (underground springs) were encountered when excavating the lock's west wall foundations, undermining the work, and causing the newly laid concrete to crack. Work was delayed by remedial work to counter these springs, consisting of sunken centrifugal pumps used to draw of the water, temporarily reducing the local level of the water table. The lock was faced with granite. A pipe subway lined with cast iron <b>segmental</b> <b>rings</b> ran under part of the lock, carrying services (hydraulic, water, electricity). The initially installed gates were of oak, operated by hydraulically activated chains. The new east pier was 500 ft long and constructed of timber, on the west side part of the old pier was removed and a new 175 ft pier section added, meeting the old at a [...] "V".|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, several tunnels {{bored with}} Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM) {{are already in}} service and various dozens are being {{constructed}} around the world. The internal support of these usually consist of precast concrete <b>segmental</b> <b>rings</b> with a low – moderate amount of concrete since these elements are mainly compressed in service conditions and low tensile stresses only appear during initial transient situations (demoulding, stocking, transportation, manipulation and thrust of the jacks). Structural fibres {{have proved to be}} an interesting solution to replace part or the total amount of the rebars. In fact, fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) has already been applied in more than fifty TBM constructed tunnels so far. However, the use of FRC is not consolidated yet in this type of tunnels {{due to the lack of}} specific design methods until the publication of the last version of the Model Code 2010 as well as the high inertia to change exhibited by the technical community. In this scientific contribution, a multi-criteria decision-making model based on the MIVES method is proposed for assessing the sustainability index of precast concrete segments. This model is able to take into account the three main pillars of the sustainability (economic, environmental and social). By using this model, different reinforcement alternatives (rebars, fibres or the hybrid solution) can be assessed for specific boundary conditions (e. g., tunnel and segment geometry, concrete dosages, transport distances, risks during the manufacturing of the segments). Likewise, this model is designed to minimize the subjectivity of the decision and to facilitate the task of deciding which concrete reinforcement strategy is the most suitable in terms of sustainability. Finally, the model is used to assess the sustainability of different precast concrete segments (with different reinforcement solutions), which are potential alternatives to be used in a real tunnel placed in the metropolitan area of Barcelona.

40|$|We present neutron {{scattering}} {{data on the}} structure and dynamics of melts from polyethylene oxide rings with molecular weights up to ten times the entanglement mass of the linear counterpart. The data reveal a very compact conformation displaying a structure approaching a mass fractal, as hypothesized by recent simulation work. The dynamics {{is characterized by a}} fast Rouse relaxation of subunits (loops) and a slower dynamics displaying a lattice animal-like loop displacement. The loop size is an intrinsic property of the ring architecture and is independent of molecular weight. This is the first experimental observation of the space-time evolution of <b>segmental</b> motion in <b>ring</b> polymers illustrating the dynamic consequences of their topology that is unique among all polymeric systems of any other known architecture...|$|R
30|$|Non-mass-enhancing lesions {{exhibit a}} {{heterogeneous}} appearance in breast MRI with high variations in kinetic characteristics and typical morphological parameters[14 – 16] {{and have a}} lower reported specificity and sensitivity than mass-enhancing lesions. The diagnosis of non-mass-like enhancement lesions is thus far more challenging. Malignant lesions such as DCIS and invasive lobular cancer (ILC) exhibit a segmental or linear enhancement pattern, and benign lesions such as fibrocystic changes present as well a non-mass-like enhancement[17]. However, a systematic classification of non-mass-like enhancing lesions is not in place. A classification of such lesions would be highly beneficial since they may reduce the biopsies’ numbers. The morphological parameters with the highest predictive value in non-mass-enhancing lesions were reported in[15] as <b>segmental</b> distribution, clustered <b>ring</b> enhancement, and a clumped internal architecture. Another study has shown that including kinetic data on dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging and diffusion-weighted MRI imaging in addition to morphological characteristics showed a high diagnostic accuracy in the characterization of these lesions[16].|$|R
