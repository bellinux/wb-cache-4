40|$|A {{full scale}} {{prototype}} flexible radiator panel was designed, built and tested. The panel, has approximately 173 sq ft of radiating area {{and is designed}} to reject 1. 33 kW of heat to a 0 F sink with a 100 F fluid inlet. The panel is constructed from a flexible Teflon/silver mesh fin surrounding 1 / 8 inch Teflon tubes. The prototype panel is stowed on a 10 inch diameter by 4 foot wide drum.

40|$|The {{development}} of a theoretical model of valveless pumping and its numerical solution is presented in this work, applied for {{the case of a}} closed hydraulic loop, consisting of a soft and a rigid tube. A periodic compression and decompression of the <b>soft</b> <b>tube</b> causes a unidirectional flow, under certain conditions. The integration of the governing flow equations (continuity and momentum), over the tube cross-sectional area results in a quasi-one-dimensional unsteady model. A system of nonlinear partial differential equations of the hyperbolic type is solved numerically, employing three finite difference schemes: Lax-Wendroff, MacCormack, and Dispersion Relation Preserving, the last being the most accurate one. When the excitation takes place far from the midlength of the <b>soft</b> <b>tube,</b> a phase difference between the pressures at the two edges of each tube is developed, being in advance the one that is closer to the excitation area. Increasing the tube occlusion or the length of the excited part of the loop the mean flow rate increases and maximizes at the natural frequency of the loop. The direction of the maximum mean flow rate, for a given tube occlusion, is from the excitation area {{toward the edge of the}} stiff tube, which is located closer to the excitation area. Varying the excitation frequency both above and below the resonance frequency, local flow rate extremes appear, manifesting the complex character of the valveless pumping phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} {{occurrence}} of torsional instabilities in soft, incompressible, thick-walled tubes with both circumferential and axial pre-stretches. Assuming a neo-Hookean strain energy function, we investigate the helical buckling under a finite torsion in three different classes of boundary conditions: (a) no applied loads at {{the internal and external}} surfaces of the cylindrical tube, (b) a pressure load P acting on the external surface or (c) on the internal surface. We perform a linear stability analysis on the axisymmetric solutions using the method of small deformations superposed on finite strains. Applying a helical perturbation, we derive the Stroh formulation of the incremental boundary value problems and we solve it using a numerical procedure based on the surface impedance method. The threshold values of the torsion rate and the associated critical circumferential and longitudinal modes {{at the onset of the}} instability are examined in terms of the circumferential and axial pre-stretches, and of the initial geometry of the <b>soft</b> <b>tube...</b>|$|E
40|$|Flexible fin {{radiators}} {{are being}} developed to meet spacecraft requirements of light weight, compact launch volume, modular growth, reusability, and the capability of an on-orbit deployment and retraction. Two prototype versions of deployable/retractable, flexible finspace radiators (soft and hard tube) were tested simultaneously under thermal vacuum conditions. A map of the heat rejection performance of each radiator panel under various environmental conditions is given. The <b>soft</b> <b>tube</b> radiator deployment system demonstrated minimal gas pressure and was capable of maintaining partial deployment; temperature control was achieved by varying the deployment length. The radiator could be recovered after an inadvertant freezing of the coolant in the Teflon tube. The hard tube radiator deployment mechanism performed adequately throughout the testing, but did exhibit some undesirable performance characteristics. The hard tube radiator pressure drop was higher than expected, but was not affected by the length of deployment. The radiator operated at less than full deployment, and the manifolds {{were found to have}} a significant effect on heat rejection. At low-load conditions, the hard tube radiator appeared to bypass its deployed area...|$|E
40|$|Cerianthus membranaceus, as {{commonly}} {{available at}} Naples, is a brownish polyp which can extend to 15 — 20 cm. and contract to 5 — 7 cm. The numerous tentacles are less contractile, being usually 3 - 5 cm. long. The gross anatomical structure is well described by Hyman (1940). The polyp normally {{lives in a}} <b>soft</b> <b>tube,</b> which it secretes, and has no foot or sphincter muscle. Lacking the diversity of muscle groups of a typical sea anemone its movements are very restricted. In contrast to other coelenterate polyps the Ceriantharia have a substantial ectodermal muscu-lature of the column, {{which is responsible for}} the vigorous withdrawal of the animal into its tube. There are also ectodermal radial fibres on the disk. Endodermal muscles are relatively insignificant and play no part in the responses considered here. In common with all other coelenterate polyps Cerianthus has two kinds of rapid response to external changes: the feeding movements and the protective retraction. In Cerianthus the two are aroused by different stimuli, and in part they are effected by different muscles.

40|$|A {{microfluidic}} lab-on-chip {{device was}} developed to automatically and selectively manipulate target cells at the single cell level. The device is composed of a microfluidic chip, mini solenoid valves with negative-pressurized soft tubes, and a LabView®-based data acquisition device. Once a target cell passes the resistive pulse sensing gate of the microfluidic chip, the solenoid valves are automatically actuated and open the negative-pressurized tubes placed {{at the ends of}} the collecting channels. As a result, the cell is transported to that collecting well. Numerical simulation shows that a 0. 14 mm 3 volume change of the <b>soft</b> <b>tube</b> can result in a 1. 58 mm/s moving velocity of the sample solution. Experiments with single polystyrene particles and cancer cells samples were carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. Selectively manipulating a certain size of particles from a mixture solution was also achieved. Due to the very high pressure-driven flow switching, as many as 300 target cells per minute can be isolated from the sample solution and thus is particularly suitable for manipulating very rare target cells. The device is simple, automatic, and label-free and particularly suitable for isolating single cells off the chip one by one for downstream analysis...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{evaluate}} here {{our experience}} with modified Cantwell–Ransley technique described by Gearhart for correction of isolated continent epispadias in adults {{with respect to}} its long-term functional outcome and complications. Introduction: Isolated male epispadias is a rare anomaly with a reported incidence of 1 in 11, 700 males. Many surgical techniques with various modifications described to correct epispadias as treatment are debatable and challenging. The majority of the cases are treated at childhood as clinical presentation is striking at birth; hence, presentation in adulthood is extremely rare. Materials and Methods: During the past 5 years, modified Cantwell–Ransley technique described by Gearhart was performed in five cases of isolated continent epispadias which includes two cases of proximal penile, two distal penile and one penopubic. All cases were fresh except one had prior failed repair. Corporal rotation was done by delayed absorbable sutures without incision and anastomosis and suprapubic diversions placed in all the cases. Results: All cases followed up ranging from 6 months to 5 years and were having horizontal and downwards angled penis. No case had urethrocutaneous fistula or stricture. One case had superficial skin infection which healed by secondary intention did not require any secondary procedure. All cases maintained erection post-operatively too. Catheterisation with <b>soft</b> <b>tube</b> revealed easily negotiable channel in all cases on follow-up.

40|$|An infant with Hemophilus influenzae {{meningitis}} and pericarditis {{was treated}} successfully with antibiotics and pericardiostomy. Review {{of the literature}} revealed 19 cases of Hemophilus in-fluenzae pericarditis. Six cases were associated with meningitis. The importance of early diagnosis combined with surgical drainage of purulent pericarditis is stressed. E&dquo;&dquo;Ik. 8., A FIVE-MONTH-OLD boy, was ad-mitted to Children’s Hospital of Michigan with fever, stupor, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, rigid neck, and a tense bulging fontanel. Hemophilus in-fluenzae type B was cultured from the blood and the spinal fluid, and intravenous ampicillin therapy was instituted. In the first chest x-ray, the cardiac silhouette was mildly enlarged. An electrocar-diogram revealed abnormal q waves in II, III, avF and V 7 and ST elevation in the same leads. On the second hospital day, hepatomegaly became apparent and an ultrasound examination confirmed the clinical suspicion of pericardial effusion. A pericardiocentesis attempted with a number 18 needle through a subxiphoid ap-proach, yielded only 5 ml of thick, purulent material. Surgical drainage seemed advisable and was done immediately afterwards, with a <b>soft</b> <b>tube</b> left in for continuous drainage. This released 200 ml of purulent fluid; cultures of this fluid were sterile. Marked clinical improvement followed the pericardiostomy.

40|$|Severely debilitated or post-surgical {{sea turtles}} often suffer from anorexia, making their {{management}} very challenging. In cases like these, a nutritional support is mandatory. Common practice in rescue centres is assisted feeding, daily administered via a <b>soft</b> <b>tube</b> passed by mouth to stomach. This procedure {{is relatively easy}} in most reptile species, but it results very difficult in chelonians, and particularly in large sea turtles, as access to mouth and oesophagus can become impossible if the animal withdraw the head. Furthermore, this practice can result a source of considerable stress in wild animals, and in sea turtles it becomes very messy because of the particularly narrow gastroesophageal sphincter. The placement of a permanent oesophagostomy tube can considerably simplify the daily administration of assisted nutrition. Drugs (antibiotics, vitamins, etc.) and fluids, essential in the clinical management, are as well easily administered through the permanent oesophagostomy. This procedure was performed in 5 severely ill Loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in order to assure a correct assisted feeding. All patients were anaesthetized with 4 - 5 mg/kg intravenous propofol. Before placement, the tube length was pre-measured from the lateral side of the neck to the left pectoral scute, then permanently marked. With the extended neck, a curved hemostat was introduced through the mouth into the esophagus and laterally displaced. This caused the skin to tent and the carotid and jugular veins to slip dorsally or ventrally to avoid them to be incised. A small incision was made trough the skin and {{the wall of the}} esophagus with a scalpel blade {{at the tip of the}} hemostat, that has been forced outside by blunt. The incision has to be as caudal as possible in the neck to avoid the turtle to entangle a limb and extract the tube. The tip of the tube was grasped with the clamp, pulled through the incision and withdrawn trough the mouth to the marked point. Then, the tube was redirected into the oesophagus and pushed up to the stomach. Levin’s tubes 4 - 5 mm diameter with radiopaque guide were used, to verify the correct placement by x-ray examination. After placement the tube was sutured to the skin just next to the incision with nonabsorbable sutures; the extended length of the tube was secured to the edge of the nucal scute with a suture and to the carapace with cyanoacrylic glue. Broad spectrum antibiotics were administered after the surgical procedure. Patients were fed daily through the tube with homogenized fish and shellfish, supplemented with vitamins. After food administration, the tube was washed with few millilitres of saline solution to avoid its obstruction. The tube was well tolerated, and the turtles were able to eat normally in 2 - 3 weeks while it was still in place. The tube was kept in place for two more weeks after appetite had returned to normal. If the tube has to be held in place for several weeks, it is possible that reparative reactions expel stitches and the tube needs to be sutured again...|$|E
