40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>singing</b> synthesis system, VocaLis-tener, that automatically estimates parameters for <b>singing</b> synthesis from a user’s <b>singing</b> voice {{with the help}} of song lyrics. Although there is a method to estimate <b>singing</b> syn-thesis parameters of pitch (F 0) and dynamics (power) from a <b>singing</b> voice, it does not adapt to different <b>singing</b> synthe-sis conditions (e. g., different <b>singing</b> synthesis systems and their singer databases) or <b>singing</b> skill/style modifications. To deal with different conditions, VocaListener repeatedly updates <b>singing</b> synthesis parameters so that the synthe-sized <b>singing</b> can more closely mimic the user’s <b>singing.</b> Moreover, VocaListener has functions to help modify the user’s <b>singing</b> by correcting off-pitch phrases or changing vibrato. In an experimental evaluation under two different <b>singing</b> synthesis conditions, our system achieved synthe-sized <b>singing</b> that closely mimicked the user’s <b>singing.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|After a {{few weeks}} of {{training}} with Burke, <b>Sing</b> was scouted by All Japan Women (AJW), despite her inexperience. Sing's debut match in Japan was a tag team match with partner Mami Kumano, defeating the Beauty Pair (Jackie Sato and Maki Ueda) in January 1979. In Japan, she began wrestling under the name Monster Ripper. Although she found adjusting to the Japanese culture difficult, <b>Sing</b> held AJW's title on two occasions and was the first Calgary born wrestler to gain success in Japan. During her time in the company, the Japanese female wrestlers gave her a hard time because they did not like losing to foreigners. <b>Sing</b> also had difficulty because of her youth and inexperience in the ring. <b>Sing,</b> however, was comforted by New Japan Pro Wrestling's Dynamite Kid, who had also trained in Calgary. <b>Sing</b> won the WWWA World Single Championship from Jackie Sato on July 31, 1979. Despite losing the title to Sato six weeks later, she regained it on March 15, 1980. The title was vacated in August 1980.|$|E

Seeking safety in a traffic pulpit, <b>Sing</b> is surprised as his body rapidly heals from the injuries sustained in the escape, the pain causing him to strike {{the sides of the}} pulpit with extreme force, covering the surface in indentations.

5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{are famous}} for their song repertoires. Studies have shown that males <b>sing</b> songs at the {{beginning}} of breeding season to attract females. Unmated males <b>sing</b> songs in more directions and <b>sing</b> more bouts than mated males. In addition, unmated males perform more flight displays than mated males. The mockingbirds usually nest several times during one breeding season. Depending on the stage of breeding and the mating status, a male mockingbird will vary his song production. The unmated male keeps close track of this change. He sings in one direction when he perceives a chance to lure a female from the nest of the mated male. Unmated males {{are also more likely to}} use elevated perches to extend his songs to a further range. Though the mockingbirds are socially monogamous, mated males have been known to <b>sing</b> to attract additional mates.|$|E

5|$|<b>Sing</b> {{was born}} on 2 March 1886 in Clermont, Queensland, Australia, {{the son of a}} Chinese father and an English mother. His parents were John <b>Sing</b> (c. 1842–1921), a drover from Shanghai, China, and Mary Ann <b>Sing</b> (née Pugh; c. 1857–unknown), a nurse from Kingswinford, Staffordshire, England. Sing's mother had given birth to a {{daughter}} named Mary Ann Elizabeth Pugh on 28 May 1883, less than two months before marrying Sing's father on 4 July 1883. It is unclear whether this child was John Sing's daughter as well. A daughter, Beatrice <b>Sing,</b> was later born into the family on 12 July 1893.
