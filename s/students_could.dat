5|$|Despite its name, {{the college}} taught no classes in agriculture, instead concentrating on {{classical}} studies, languages, literature, and applied mathematics. After four years, <b>students</b> <b>could</b> attain degrees in scientific agriculture, civil and mining engineering, and language and literature. Local farmers {{complained that the}} college was abusing its mission, and, in November 1879, the president and faculty were replaced and given a mandated curriculum in agriculture and engineering.|$|E
5|$|Bath Township {{is a small}} {{community}} located ten miles (16km) northeast of Lansing, Michigan which contains the unincorporated village of Bath. The area was primarily agricultural in the early 1920s. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, many small one-room schools were closed, where different grades shared the same classroom and teacher. Educators of the era believed that children would receive a better and more complete education if <b>students</b> <b>could</b> attend a single school at one location. The grades could be age-divided into classes, and the facilities could be of a higher quality.|$|E
5|$|Binghamton University was {{established}} in 1946 as Triple Cities College, to {{serve the needs of}} local veterans of the Binghamton, New York area, who were returning from World War II. Established in Endicott, New York, the college was a branch of Syracuse University. Triple Cities College offered local students {{the first two years of}} their education, while the following two were spent at Syracuse University. In 1946, <b>students</b> <b>could</b> earn their degrees entirely at the Binghamton campus. In 1950, it was absorbed by the State University of New York and renamed Harpur College.|$|E

5|$|George B. McDougall was {{selected}} as the supervising architect and the State Department of Architecture for Public Buildings designed the new campus. The initial planned cost was $7,500,000. On October 7, 1929 classes were dismissed early so all current <b>students</b> <b>could</b> attend the groundbreaking held on that day. Pettifer & Hupt {{was selected}} as the construction firm, and it completed several buildings by September 1930. The first classes made up of 1,220 students were held at Montezuma Mesa in February 1931.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, the {{nationalist}} McGill français movement demanded that McGill become francophone, pro-nationalist, and pro-worker. The movement {{was led by}} Stanley Gray, {{a political science professor}} (and possibly unaware of government plans after the recent (1968) legislation founding the Université du Québec) A demonstration was held of 10,000 trade unionists, leftist activists, CEGEP students, and even some McGill students, at the university's Roddick Gates on March 28, 1969. Protesters saw English as the privileged language of commerce. McGill, where Francophones comprised only three percent of the <b>students,</b> <b>could</b> be seen as the force maintaining economic control by Anglophones of a predominantly French-speaking province. However, the majority of students and faculty opposed such a position.|$|E
5|$|Many central {{government}} officials also began their careers as subordinate officers for commandery-level administrations. There are only rare cases (i.e. involving military merit during rebellions of late Eastern Han) when subordinate officers of county-level administrations {{advanced to the}} level of {{central government}}. Even if one secured an office by these means, an official was still expected to be competent, thus a formal education became the hallmark of those aspiring to fill public office. In addition to private tutoring, the Imperial University was established in 124 BCE which then accommodated only fifty pupils, but by the 2nd century CE the student body had reached about thirty thousand. These <b>students</b> <b>could</b> be appointed by the emperor to various government posts according to their examination grades.|$|E

40|$|Data mining is {{becoming}} increasingly important {{as the amount of}} data being stored increases, and data miners are highly sought after in the job market. This paper describes a pilot course-offering in data mining in a small, four-year liberal arts college as part of a mixed Computer Science and Computer Information Systems curriculum. Several curricular choices are examined, including text and software selection, and the design of a final project to assess student performance. The final project offered three alternatives: The <b>student</b> <b>could</b> implement or extend a data mining algorithm in the language of their choice, the <b>student</b> <b>could</b> prepare a major paper on the impact of data mining to their discipline, or the <b>student</b> <b>could</b> find an outside project (with instructor approval) to analyze using the developed data mining techniques. The role of service learning as an intentional curricular choice is also examined, and two student projects are discussed. ...|$|R
5|$|Beginning in 1969, {{during the}} Vietnam War, the {{university}} {{did not allow}} the U.S. military to have Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) programs on campus, though Columbia <b>students</b> <b>could</b> participate in ROTC programs at other local colleges and universities. At a forum at the university during the 2008 presidential election campaign, both John McCain and Barack Obama said that the university should consider reinstating ROTC on campus. After the debate, the President of the University, Lee C. Bollinger, stated {{that he did not}} favor reinstating Columbia's ROTC program, because of the military's anti-gay policies. In November 2008, Columbia's undergraduate student body held a referendum {{on the question of whether}} or not to invite ROTC back to campus, and the students who voted were almost evenly divided on the issue. ROTC lost the vote (which would not have been binding on the administration, and did not include graduate students, faculty, or alumni) by a fraction of a percentage point.|$|E
5|$|Diệm spent {{little time}} on {{detailed}} defence and policy discussions with Australian officials during the trip, {{because of his}} extensive meetings with Catholic leaders. Although Diệm had signalled his intentions to discuss defence relations during the visit, these did not materialise. At {{the end of the}} visit, Diệm and Menzies released a bilateral statement, announcing that they would increase the magnitude of the Colombo Plan, a program under which Asian <b>students</b> <b>could</b> study abroad in Western nations. However, there was little detail in the announcements relating to anti-communism, with only general expressions of Australian support. Diệm had previously stated that if North Vietnam attacked the south, he would send the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to land in the Red River Delta in the north and retaliate. This was contrary to the air attack plans of the South East Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO), which had vowed to defend the south under the provisions of the Manila Treaty. Despite the public statements of support, the Australian government never shared the details of the SEATO plans with Diệm.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, it {{was decided}} by the University of Melbourne that Burnet would be {{appointed}} a professor {{as part of a}} cooperative program so that university <b>students</b> <b>could</b> be experimentally trained at the institute, while the researchers engaged in some teaching. This was not a success, and there was much tension, as Burnet repeatedly expressed his opinion in public that university teaching and research should be kept separate, at one point leading to a series of open letters from university professors decrying his attitude. Burnet was also not interested in the politics of university funding, and his disengagement from administrative matters engendered resentment. On the other hand, Burnet was vigorous in obtaining funding for the Hall Institute from government bodies, resorting to the bluff of feigning interest in moving overseas to secure continued strong backing. However, he was criticised for being thrifty and refusing to invest in cutting edge equipment, despite the Hall Institute's high standing in research circles. Colleagues believed that he was sceptical of modern technology and thought his outlook to be limiting.|$|E

5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how <b>students</b> <b>could</b> be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate ab initio, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} secure a {{position}} as a teacher, erudite in the capital, or government official, a student could choose one of several paths to become well educated. Perhaps the most prestigious path was enrollment in the Imperial University. Students had to be above the age of eighteen to enroll, and were selected by the Minister of Ceremonies from those recommended by local authorities. Other <b>students</b> <b>could</b> choose to enroll in a school sponsored by the local commandery government. A professional teacher who opened a private school {{in a small town}} or village could sometimes gather a following of several hundred to over a thousand students. Students were expected to pay tuition, thus a teacher enjoyed a significant salary. His standing in the local community was usually paramount, and was even sought as an arbiter in disputes. Although the size of the Imperial Academy was greatly expanded in Eastern Han, private schools grew in importance as the imperial government lost authority and its academy's persecution of Old Text tradition drove many to pursue Old Text studies in private institutions.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, Anderson {{introduced}} a bill to raise the age after which a Maryland public school <b>student</b> <b>could</b> dropout from age 16 to age 18. The bill failed, but the Maryland General Assembly passed the same bill in 2012.|$|R
50|$|After {{many schools}} {{tried and failed}} to insist on only admitting <b>students</b> who <b>could</b> already read, a {{different}} approach to education came about. Schools focused on sponsoring literacy at all levels of student knowledge. <b>Students</b> who <b>could</b> read were taught more difficult materials, while <b>students</b> who <b>could</b> not were given elementary reading instruction. The bulk of literacy centered on reading, but, while many early schools focused on reading skills alone, increased literacy ability was soon desirable.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the highest}} honors a <b>student</b> <b>could</b> receive at Vanderbilt was Bachelor of Ugliness, created by William H. Dodd in 1885 and given to the male {{undergraduate}} student considered most representative of ideal young manhood. In 1923, Neely received the award.|$|R

25|$|From 1977, <b>students</b> <b>could</b> study Nepal Bhasa at the Master's level; but the {{university}} degree was not counted for promotion by the government, {{and so there}} were few takers for the subject.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan had}} the {{drawbacks}} of limiting {{the amount of}} detail to which <b>students</b> <b>could</b> be exposed, and would require a rebuilding of the staff and curriculum when the long course was reinstated. Nevertheless, the curriculum was changed from 712 academic hours to 298. The short courses began on 1 June 1939, and continued for the next year.|$|E
