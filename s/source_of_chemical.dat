5|$|The {{study of}} plants is vital because they {{underpin}} almost all animal life on Earth by generating {{a large proportion}} of the oxygen and food that provide humans and other organisms with aerobic respiration with the chemical energy they need to exist. Plants, algae and cyanobacteria are the major groups of organisms that carry out photosynthesis, a process that uses the energy of sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugars that can be used both as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> energy and of organic molecules that are used in the structural components of cells. As a by-product of photosynthesis, plants release oxygen into the atmosphere, a gas that is required by nearly all living things to carry out cellular respiration. In addition, they are influential in the global carbon and water cycles and plant roots bind and stabilise soils, preventing soil erosion. Plants are crucial to the future of human society as they provide food, oxygen, medicine, and products for people, as well as creating and preserving soil.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} the level of dietary exposure to a chemical residue, {{the level of the}} residue of interest within a particular food of interest or the whole food supply must be estimated.

500|$|The {{mitochondrion}} (plural mitochondria) is {{a double}} membrane-bound organelle found in all eukaryotic organisms. Some cells in some multicellular organisms may however lack them (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells). A number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids, and diplomonads, have also reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures. To date, only one eukaryote, Monocercomonoides, {{is known to have}} completely lost its mitochondria. The word mitochondrion comes from the Greek , , [...] "thread", and , , [...] "granule" [...] or [...] "grain-like".

5000|$|Mitochondria are {{sometimes}} described as [...] "cellular power plants" [...] because they generate {{most of the}} cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> energy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been regarded as unwanted by-products of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria by the proponents of the free-radical theory of aging promoted by Denham Harman.

50|$|Microbial electrosynthesis {{is related}} to {{microbial}} electrolysis cells (MEC). Both use the interactions of microorganisms with a cathode to reduce chemical compounds, but differ in the source of power for this process. In microbialelectrosynthesis electrons are supplied solely by the external electrical power source. In MECs, an electrical power source is used to augment the electrical potential produced by the microorganisms consuming a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>chemical</b> energy such as acetic acid. The combined potential provided by the power source and the microorganisms is then sufficient to for example reduce hydrogen ions to molecular hydrogen.|$|E
