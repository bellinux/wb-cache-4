40|$|Based on {{the safety}} spark test apparatus, the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>spark</b> {{discharge}} (SCSD) characteristics of the simple capacitive circuit and switching converter are studied. It is pointed out that their SCSD process {{can be divided into}} four stages, that is, dielectric-breakdown stage, spark-generated stage, spark-maintenance stage, and spark-extinguish stage; moreover, there is different equivalent spark resistance in each stage. For the simple capacitive circuit, its spark resistance is larger and maintaining voltage is almost unchanged in the spark-maintenance stage. For the switching converter, its output short-circuit characteristics depend strongly on the load resistance and its maintaining voltage reduces rapidly with the decrease of the load resistance. The circuit model is proposed, which can simulate the output SCSD process of the switching converter. By using the least-squares method, the relationship expressions between the discharge duration and capacitance in each time-stage are derived and the corresponding equivalent resistance is obtained. The mathematical models are established, and the expressions of the discharge current and voltage are deduced. Experiment and simulation results are positive in the analysis showing the feasibility of the proposed models...|$|E
5000|$|Some {{other very}} common English-language {{examples}} are hiccup, zoom, bang, beep, moo, and splash. Machines and their sounds are also often described with onomatopoeia: honk or beep-beep for {{the horn of}} an automobile, and vroom or brum for the engine. In speaking of a mishap involving an audible arcing of electricity, the word [...] "zap" [...] is often used (and its use has been extended to describe non-auditory effects generally connoting {{the same sort of}} localized but thorough interference or destruction similar to that produced in <b>short-circuit</b> <b>sparking).</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{guard at}} the plant told reporters that {{electrical}} devices used to shake explosive powder down into the shrapnel shells had been malfunctioning for some time. He suggested that tangled wires in the devices had <b>short-circuited,</b> throwing <b>sparks</b> which ignited the powder. This {{would be consistent with}} workers' reports of a [...] "blinding flare" [...] before the explosion. Some of those killed were found with their hands still covering their eyes.|$|R
5000|$|The pilot's last {{messages}} {{suggested that}} {{a fire in the}} rear of the aircraft was responsible for the accident. This part was not accessible from the cabin and had no smoke detectors, so the crew was not immediately able to realize the severity of the situation. The fire was caused by a leak in a hot-air tube through which air with a temperature of some [...] left the tube and damaged the insulation material of electrical wires and airplane control. After take-off a <b>short-circuit</b> caused <b>sparks</b> with a temperature of some [...] and a fire in cargo bay no. 4. This fire then grew until the smoke reached the passenger cabin and the fuselage structure was weakened. Finally the tail section failed in flight.|$|R
40|$|Most {{mains-operated}} {{equipment in}} use today {{is connected to the}} supply via plugs and sockets. These are generally acceptable in benign environments but can be unsafe or have limited life in the presence of moisture. In explosive atmospheres and in under-sea applications special connectors must be used. This paper describes a technique, the Contactless Energy Transfer System (CETS), by which electrical energy may be transmitted, without electrical connection or physical contact, through non-magnetic media of low conductivity. CETS, which has been used to transfer up to 5 kW across a 10 mm gap, employs high-frequency magnetic coupling and enables plug-in power connections to be made in wet or hazardous environmental conditions without the risk of electric shock, <b>short-circuiting</b> or <b>sparking.</b> Energy may be transmitted without the necessity for accurately manufactured "plug and socket" mechanisms and may be transmitted from source to load even when there is relative motion. Load-source voltage matching may be made inherent to the system...|$|R
