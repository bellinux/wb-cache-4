Then in principle it can use an aggregate objective function to rate the alternative sets of predicted outcomes, although in practice central banks use a non-quantitative, judgement-based, process for ranking the alternatives and making the policy choice.|$|R

Estimation of the natural interest rate (NIR) is crucial to capture the <b>stance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> In particular, the gap between the instrument rate of the Central Bank and the NIR can be a useful guideline for the position <b>of</b> the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> and can also help to rationalize policy decisions. In this paper we estimate the NIR for the Peruvian Economy. We do so by applying the Kalman Filter to a semi-structural small open economy model with Peruvian data during he sample 1994 - 2005. Overall, our findings show a persistent reduction on the Peruvian NIR since 1999, which is related to an improvement on the terms of trade and a reduction on the international interest rate. Moreover, the estimated gap shows a loose monetary impulse between 1994 and 1997, tight between 1998 and 2001, and slightly loose between 2002 - 2005. Finally, the variance decomposition shows that 25 percent of fluctuations in the gap are explained by fluctuations in the NIR.
