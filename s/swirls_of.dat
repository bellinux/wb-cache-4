5|$|Towards {{the end of}} May 2008, {{computer}} hurricane models {{forecast the}} development of a broad low pressure area to the southwest of Central America. On May 26, a large trough extended from the southwestern Caribbean Sea across Costa Rica into the eastern Pacific Ocean, forming a broad low pressure area across the region. A scattered area of strong convection developed, partially in association with the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Located within an area of weak steering currents, the disturbance remained nearly stationary, and on May 27 its shower activity increased in organization. Initially the system consisted of several cyclonic <b>swirls,</b> <b>of</b> which the most pronounced one was located about 340miles (550km) west-southwest of San José, Costa Rica. The system gradually became better organized, and with a sufficiently well-developed circulation and convective structure, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified the system as Tropical Depression One-E at 0300UTC on May 29, about 105miles (165km) west-northwest of Cabo Blanco, Costa Rica.|$|E
500|$|Describing the album's music, Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{said that}} it {{contains}} [...] "flourishes of neo-psychedelia on pummeling metal numbers and there are <b>swirls</b> <b>of</b> strings, even crooning, at the most unexpected background." [...] While the band was opposed to solos, they allowed John Otto to perform an extended drum solo {{in the middle of}} [...] "Nobody Like You". Scott Borland wrote string melodies for [...] "Don't Go Off Wandering".|$|E
2500|$|The 1960s {{version of}} Tecelares {{is even more}} organic and {{expressive}} than the earlier 1959 version. The print shows {{the grain of the}} woodblock even more overtly in the bottom portion of the print, while the top portion remains relatively muted. As in the other prints in this series, Sem Título [...] (1960) is cut by diagonal lines that disrupt the continuity of the horizontal wood grain pattern, creating movement and distinct planes in the artwork, though they are considerably more subtle than the 1959 Sem Título [...] print of the same series. Also similar to the 1959 print, the 1960 print has the same imprecise quality created by the feathering of the ink on the rice paper. It also has a very organic quality, which is produced through the patterns and <b>swirls</b> <b>of</b> the wood grain. Because of this organic pattern, this print seems to overtly oppose the mechanic properties associated with Concrete art.|$|E

2500|$|Quentin Letts of The Daily Mail {{gave the}} show a {{negative}} review, stating that it [...] "is as slow to motor as a lawnmower at spring's first cut". He also criticised {{the show for}} lacking in storytelling and romance, stating that it [...] "assumes that we understand the attraction these two dullards [...] have for the beautiful Christine. Could she do no better? ... In the end you conclude that she simply seeks out suffering to improve her art." [...] Letts praised the performances and the orchestration but concluded that the show was not a hit: [...] "But {{if it is a}} miss, it is ... a noble miss, noble because Lloyd Webber’s increasingly operatic music tries to lift us to a higher plane." [...] Susannah Clapp of The Observer was also critical of the book and called the show [...] "drab" [...] and [...] "about as tension-filled as winding wool." [...] Even the musical numbers, she wrote, [...] "never meld with the visual splendours, never give the effect, which is Lloyd Webber's gift, of the music delivering the scenery." [...] Sam Marlowe of Time Out London gave the show one out of five stars, calling it [...] "ghastly" [...] and [...] "an interminable musical monstrosity". He observes: [...] "With its sickening <b>swirls</b> <b>of</b> video imagery, pointless plot, and protracted, repetitive songs, Love Never Dies ... is punishingly wearisome." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{not long}} before a dull, moaning sound was heard, the brown-red fog changed its appearance, <b>swirls</b> <b>of</b> vapour seemed to dash out in front of it, and the whole swelled and heaved as if it were being pushed forward by some {{tremendous}} pressure in its rear.|$|E
60|$|With Dinah's assistance, Nat fixed {{a blanket}} {{at the point}} where the narrow {{entrance}} widened out, to keep out the <b>swirls</b> <b>of</b> wind which from time to time rushed in, propping it in its place by the hand-barrow on which Madame Duchesne had been brought up. Myra had finished cooking the fowls just as her nurse arrived, and they sat down to their meal heedless of the terrific tempest that was raging outside.|$|E

60|$|Just {{then one}} of those rushes or <b>swirls</b> <b>of</b> water, which are common among rocks in such a position, swept him again forward, right into the eddy which he had {{struggled}} in vain to reach, and thrust him violently against the rock. This back current was the precursor of a tremendous billow, which came towering on like a black moving wall. Ruby saw it, and, twining his arm amongst the seaweed, held his breath.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I saw life plain,' he wrote. 'I saw the {{gigantic}} task before us, {{and the very}} splendour of its intricate and immeasurable difficulty filled me with exaltation. I saw that we have still to discover government, that we have still to discover education, which is the necessary reciprocal of government, and that all this--in which my own little speck of a life was so manifestly overwhelmed--this and its yesterday in Greece and Rome and Egypt were nothing, the mere first dust <b>swirls</b> <b>of</b> the beginning, the movements and dim murmurings of a sleeper who will presently be awake....' ...|$|E
60|$|Nowhere else than {{upon the}} sea do the days, {{weeks and months}} fall away quicker into the past. They seem to be left astern as easily as the light air-bubbles in the <b>swirls</b> <b>of</b> the ship's wake, and vanish into a great silence in which your ship moves on {{with a sort of}} magical effect. They pass away, the days, the weeks, the months. Nothing but a gale can disturb the orderly life of the ship; and the spell of unshaken monotony that seems to have fallen upon the very voices of her men is broken only by the near {{prospect}} of a Landfall.|$|E

50|$|In fluid dynamics, an eddy is the <b>swirling</b> <b>of</b> a {{fluid and}} the reverse current created when the fluid is in a {{turbulent}} flow regime. The moving fluid creates a space devoid of downstream-flowing fluid on the downstream {{side of the}} object. Fluid behind the obstacle flows into the void creating a <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> fluid on each edge of the obstacle, followed by a short reverse flow of fluid behind the obstacle flowing upstream, {{toward the back of}} the obstacle. This phenomenon is naturally observed behind large emergent rocks in swift-flowing rivers.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} the stout {{old man with}} white {{whiskers}} looked up, and the watering can fell from his hand, shooting a <b>swirl</b> <b>of</b> water down the gravel path.|$|R
60|$|Plain and {{positive}} as he was, {{the influence of}} earth and sky may have been greater on him than he imagined; and the weather that walked the world at that moment was as red and angry as Turnbull. Long strips and <b>swirls</b> <b>of</b> tattered and tawny cloud were dragged downward to the west exactly as torn red raiment would be dragged. And so strong and pitiless was the wind that it whipped away fragments of red-flowering bushes or of copper beech, and drove them also across the garden, a drift of red leaves, like the leaves of autumn, as in parody of the red and driven rags of cloud.|$|E
6000|$|As, for defence of his {{universal}} indistinctness, my {{appeal was}} in the last chapter to universal fact, so, for defence of this special indistinctness, my first appeal is in this chapter to special fact. An English painter justifiably loves fog, because he is born in a foggy country; as an Italian painter justifiably loves clearness, because he is born in a comparatively clear country. I have heard a traveller familiar with the East complain of the effect in a picture of Copley Fielding's, that [...] "it was such very bad weather." [...] But it {{ought not to be}} bad weather to the English. Our green country depends for its life on those kindly rains and floating <b>swirls</b> <b>of</b> cloud; we ought, therefore, to love them and to paint them.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the land}} lay thus. Before us {{the ground was}} open and sloped down to {{the banks of the}} White Umfolozi, which twisted through the plain like a great and shining snake. On the other side the ground rose again, and we did not know what was beyond, but we thought that in this {{direction}} lay the kraal of Chaka. We ran for the river--where else were we to run? And after us came the warriors. They gained on us; they were strong, and they were angry because they had come so far. Run as we would, still they gained. Now we neared the banks of the river; it was full and wide. Above us the waters ran angrily, breaking into <b>swirls</b> <b>of</b> white where they passed over sunken rocks; below was a rapid, in which none might live; between the two a deep pool, where the water was quiet but the stream strong.|$|E

60|$|A marvellous stillness pervaded the world, and the stars, {{together}} with the serenity of their rays, seemed to shed upon the earth the assurance of everlasting security. The young moon recurved, and shining low in the west, was like a slender shaving thrown up from a bar of gold, and the Arabian Sea, smooth and cool to the eye like a sheet of ice, extended its perfect level to the perfect circle of a dark horizon. The propeller turned without a check, as though its beat {{had been part of}} the scheme of a safe universe; and on each side of the Patna two deep folds of water, permanent and sombre on the unwrinkled shimmer, enclosed within their straight and diverging ridges a few white <b>swirls</b> <b>of</b> foam bursting in a low hiss, a few wavelets, a few ripples, a few undulations that, left behind, agitated the surface of the sea for an instant after the passage of the ship, subsided splashing gently, calmed down at last into the circular stillness of water and sky with the black speck of the moving hull remaining everlastingly in its centre.|$|E
60|$|And then, {{as these}} full-blooded, {{powerful}} men became heated with their wine, angry eyes began to glare across the table, and amid the grey <b>swirls</b> <b>of</b> tobacco-smoke the lamp-light gleamed upon the fierce, hawk-like Jews, and the flushed, savage Saxons. The old quarrel {{as to whether}} Jackson had or had not committed a foul by seizing Mendoza by {{the hair on the}} occasion of their battle at Hornchurch, eight years before, came to the front once more. Dutch Sam hurled a shilling down upon the table, and offered to fight the Pride of Westminster for it if he ventured to say that Mendoza had been fairly beaten. Joe Berks, who had grown noisier and more quarrelsome as the evening went on, tried to clamber across the table, with horrible blasphemies, to come to blows with an old Jew named Fighting Yussef, who had plunged into the discussion. It needed very little more to finish the supper by a general and ferocious battle, and it was only the exertions of Jackson, Belcher, Harrison, and others of the cooler and steadier men, which saved us from a riot.|$|E
6000|$|The whole {{composite}} {{vision was}} achieved {{with the speed}} of light, producing no pause in the conversation, nor interrupting his calm train of thought. On the screen of his imagination he saw himself and this sweet and beautiful girl, facing each other and conversing in good English, in a room of books and paintings and tone and culture, and all illuminated by a bright light of steadfast brilliance; while ranged about and fading away to the remote edges of the screen were antithetical scenes, each scene a picture, and he the onlooker, free to look at will upon what he wished. He saw these other scenes through drifting vapors and <b>swirls</b> <b>of</b> sullen fog dissolving before shafts of red and garish light. He saw cowboys at the bar, drinking fierce whiskey, the air filled with obscenity and ribald language, and he saw himself with them drinking and cursing with the wildest, or sitting at table with them, under smoking kerosene lamps, while the chips clicked and clattered and the cards were dealt around. He saw himself, stripped to the waist, with naked fists, fighting his great fight with Liverpool Red in the forecastle of the Susquehanna; and he saw the bloody deck of the John Rogers, that gray morning of attempted mutiny, the mate kicking in death- throes on the main-hatch, the revolver in the old man's hand spitting fire and smoke, the men with passion-wrenched faces, of brutes screaming vile blasphemies and falling about him--and then he returned to the central scene, calm and clean in the steadfast light, where Ruth sat and talked with him amid books and paintings; and he saw the grand piano upon which she would later play to him; and he heard the echoes of his own selected and correct words, [...] "But then, may I not be peculiarly constituted to write?" ...|$|E
