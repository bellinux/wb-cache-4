5|$|India ink: Although {{named after}} {{carbonaceous}} pigment materials originating from India, Indian ink {{first appeared in}} China; some scholars <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> made {{as far back as}} the 3rd millennium BC, while others state it was perhaps not invented until the Wei Dynasty (220–265 AD).|$|E
5|$|Marley {{received}} a state funeral in Jamaica on 21 May 1981, which combined elements of Ethiopian Orthodoxy and Rastafari tradition. He {{was buried in}} a chapel near his birthplace with his red Gibson Les Paul (some accounts <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a Fender Stratocaster).|$|E

5|$|According to {{the account}} of Onofrio Panvinio, Cardinal John of Toledo {{suggested}} that the roof be removed ("Let us uncover the Room, else the Holy Ghost will never get at us"—the first recorded reference {{to the notion that}} the Holy Spirit should guide cardinal electors), which the two magistrates readily obliged. Other sources <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Charles of Anjou who orchestrated the reduction of the diet of the cardinals to bread and water and removal the roof of the Papal Palace.|$|E
5|$|Sharks {{generally}} are opportunistic feeders, but scientists propose that megalodon was largely predatory. Its great size, high-speed swimming capability, and powerful jaws, {{coupled with a}} formidable feeding apparatus, made it an apex predator capable of consuming {{a broad spectrum of}} animals. A study focusing on calcium isotopes of extinct and extant elasmobranch sharks and rays revealed that megalodon fed at a higher trophic level than the contemporaneous great white shark, that is to <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> higher up in the food chain.|$|E

50|$|Different {{scholars}} {{interpret the}} importance of this salat (prayer) differently.

5|$|The Warden's House was {{the home}} of the penitentiary's warden. It is located at the northeastern end of the Main Cellblock, next to Alcatraz Lighthouse. The 3-floor 15-room mansion was built in 1921 {{according}} to the Golden Gate National Recreational Area signpost, although some sources <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> built in 1926 or 1929 and had 17 or 18 rooms.|$|E
5|$|JFK was {{released}} in theaters on December 20, 1991. In its first week of release, JFK tied with Beauty and the Beast for fifth place in the U.S. box office and its critics began to <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a flop. Warner Brothers executives argued that this was at least partly because the film's long running time meant it had had fewer screenings than other films. Box office picked up momentum, however, {{in part due to}} a $15 million marketing campaign from the studio. By the first week in January 1992, it had grossed over $50 million worldwide, eventually earning over $200 million worldwide and $70 million in the United States during its initial run.|$|E
5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E
50|$|ZENIT <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> funded {{during its}} first three years {{in large part by}} Aid to the Church in Need, the Italian Bishops' Conference and the Legion of Christ.

5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} {{is one of}} the oldest algorithms in common use. It appears in Euclid's Elements (c. 300 BC), specifically in Book 7 (Propositions 1–2) and Book 10 (Propositions 2–3). In Book 7, the {{algorithm is}} formulated for integers, whereas in Book 10, it is formulated for lengths of line segments. (In modern usage, one would <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> formulated there for real numbers. But lengths, areas, and volumes, represented as real numbers in modern usage, are not measured in the same units and there is no natural unit of length, area, or volume; the concept of real numbers was unknown at that time.) The latter algorithm is geometrical. The GCD of two lengths a and b corresponds to the greatest length g that measures a and b evenly; in other words, the lengths a and b are both integer multiples of the length g.|$|E
