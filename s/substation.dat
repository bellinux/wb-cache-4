5|$|The Denny <b>Substation</b> {{will have}} an initial {{capacity}} of 50 Megavolt-ampere (MVA), and could increase to 405 MVA with facilities expansions. An underground distribution network, scheduled {{to be completed in}} 2020, will direct electricity from the <b>substation</b> to the Denny Triangle and South Lake Union neighborhoods. The <b>substation</b> will be connected to the Massachusetts <b>Substation</b> in SoDo via a 115-kilovolt (kV) transmission line through Downtown Seattle. The use of a gas-insulated switchgear in the Denny <b>Substation</b> will allow for a smaller footprint; the facility will also use solar cells to produce its electricity and a heat recovery system.|$|E
5|$|Final {{approval}} for the project was granted in August 2015 by the Seattle City Council, who also approved the substation's unconventional design incorporating public benefits {{in exchange for a}} street vacation. Walsh Construction was awarded the construction contract for the <b>substation</b> project, working alongside subcontractors Valley Electric, W.A. Chester and Transcon. Construction of the <b>substation</b> began in May 2016, {{and by the end of}} the year, the first outer walls were erected. When completed and energized in 2018, the Denny <b>Substation</b> will be the first new <b>substation</b> built by Seattle City Light in 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the South Lake Union {{neighborhood}} of Seattle, located {{to the north}} of downtown and east of the Seattle Center, was a manufacturing district whose electrical power was supplied by the Broad Street <b>Substation.</b> After the failure of the Seattle Commons plan in the 1990s, which proposed a large city park over the neighborhood, the land was opened for development by Paul Allen's Vulcan Real Estate, which envisioned it as a hub for biotech and high tech firms. Vulcan and Seattle City Light began talks of collaborating to build a $160 million <b>substation</b> in Interbay or South Lake Union in 2003, expecting the additional high tech firms to put a strain on the Broad Street <b>substation</b> and neighborhood lines laid in the early 2000s. In 2005, Seattle City Light determined that adding capacity at the Broad Street <b>substation</b> through new transformer banks would be sufficient for the area's needs until the mid-2010s.|$|E

40|$|<b>Substations</b> {{and their}} control are {{crucial for the}} {{availability}} of electricity in today's energy distribution. Advanced energy grids with Distributed Energy Resources require higher complexity in <b>substations,</b> distributed functionality and communication between devices inside <b>substations</b> and between <b>substations.</b> Also, <b>substations</b> include more and more intelligent devices and ICT based systems. All these devices are connected to other systems by different types of communication links or are situated in uncontrolled environments. Therefore, the risk of ICT based attacks on energy grids is growing. Consequently, security measures to counter these risks need to be an intrinsic part of energy grids.
