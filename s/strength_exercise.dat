30|$|In this study, {{the main}} {{hypothesis}} is that heavier people enjoy <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> more than normal-weight people, mediated by fat-free mass and muscle strength.

30|$|Obesity is a {{worldwide}} problem with high costs {{to society and}} well-being [1, 2]. Being physically active can prevent and decrease obesity [3] but is often challenging {{for people who are}} overweight or obese [4 – 6]. In this study, we try {{to bridge the gap between}} biological and psychological insights in the management of obesity, by examining the putative physiological and psychological benefits of <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> for heavier people [4 – 6]. People who are overweight do not only have more fat mass but also more fat-free mass [7]. With that, people who are overweight or obese are likely to have more muscle mass and to be stronger compared to people who are not overweight. Compared to aerobic <b>exercises,</b> <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> are easier for people who are overweight, and therefore, compliance to an exercise program focused on <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> is greater [8]. By being better in <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> than aerobic exercises, people who are overweight might be more positive about <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> compared to normal-weight people, and with that, long-term behavior change may be achieved [4 – 6]. Additionally, performing <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> has beneficial effects on overweight or obese people’s body composition and, with that, on their metabolic and cardiovascular health [1]. In this study, we cross-sectionally test the “chain of assumptions” that (1) heavier people have more fat mass and more fat-free mass, (2) they are stronger and better in <b>strength</b> <b>exercises,</b> and (3) they have more positive associations with <b>strength</b> <b>exercises.</b> This chain resulted in two hypotheses. The main hypothesis is that (1) heavier people are more positive about <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> compared to normal-weight people, because they have more fat-free mass and a higher muscle strength. Further, it is hypothesized that (2) people who are heavier are not only better in <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> but also more positive about <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> compared to aerobic exercises.|$|R
30|$|We (1) {{confirmed}} that heavier {{people have a}} higher fat-free mass compared to normal-weight people. This {{is in line with}} biological insights [7]. Additionally, (2) we have shown that people with a higher fat-free mass are stronger (in absolute sense) and are better in <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> than in aerobic exercises. We have also {{confirmed that}} (3) mastery experiences (in this case, resulting from successfully engaging in <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> as opposed to aerobic exercises) are related to more positive psychological outcomes. This observation is in line with psychological insights [20 – 23]. As hypothesized, we (4) have shown that heavier people are more positive about <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> compared to normal-weight people, via fat-free mass and muscle strength. Moreover, (5) heavier people are better in <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> and are more positive about <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> compared to aerobic exercises.|$|R
50|$|The plank (also {{called a}} front hold, hover, or {{abdominal}} bridge) is an isometric core <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> that involves maintaining a position {{similar to a}} push-up for the maximum possible time.|$|E
50|$|Pump and Run is a {{sporting}} event which consists of a strength challenge followed by a race. Typically a bench press event {{is followed by a}} 5K running event. Participants receive a deduction from their overall run time for each repetition of the <b>strength</b> <b>exercise.</b> The person with the lowest adjusted run time wins theevent.|$|E
50|$|Sleeping {{in a more}} upright {{position}} seems to lessen catathrenia (as well as sleep apnea). Performing regular aerobic exercise, where steady breathing is necessary (running, cycling etc.) may lessen catathrenia. <b>Strength</b> <b>exercise,</b> on the other hand, may worsen catathrenia because of the tendency to hold one's breath while exercising. Yoga and/or meditation focused on steady and regular breathing may lessen catathrenia.|$|E

30|$|Significant {{correlations}} between weight/BMI and fat-free mass (index) (r values[*]=[*]. 70 –. 80, p values[*]<[*]. 001), fat-free mass and muscle strength (r values[*]=[*]. 35 –. 55, p values[*]<[*]. 05), and muscle strength and attitudes, intentions, and motivation for <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> were found (r values[*]=[*]. 29 –. 43, p values[*]<[*]. 05); BMI {{was related to}} psychological determinants via fat-free mass and muscle strength. Furthermore, participants with a higher BMI are significantly better in <b>strength</b> <b>exercises,</b> more intrinsically motivated, and less motivated to do <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> compared to aerobic exercises (all p values[*]<[*]. 05). Trends {{in the same direction}} were found for the following variables: instrumental attitude, experiential attitude, and intention (p values[*]<[*]. 1).|$|R
30|$|Performing <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> has {{beneficial}} effects on body composition and, with that, on metabolic and cardiovascular health.|$|R
50|$|Complex {{training}} activates {{and works}} {{the nervous system}} and fast twitch muscle fibers simultaneously. The <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> activates the fast twitch muscle fibers (responsible for explosive power). The plyometric movement stresses those muscle fibers that have been activated by the strength training movement. During this activated state, the muscles have a tremendous ability to adapt. This form of intense training can teach slow twitch muscle fibers to perform like fast twitch fibers.|$|E
5000|$|For example, {{execution}} of certain specialized exercises requires concentration {{to develop the}} neuromuscular pathway needed. A <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> which duplicates a particular portion of a skill requires ultimate concentration and perseverance to repeat exactly the same movement time after time to develop the necessary muscle feel. [...] For the specialized exercises to have maximum positive transfer an athlete must be decisive in their movements and actions {{in order to develop}} the confidence to repeat the action during competition.|$|E
50|$|The {{overhead}} press exercise {{which is}} used by runners can illustrate {{the concept of a}} general <b>strength</b> <b>exercise.</b> It is a common exercise in which the arms move directly upward overhead. In running, however, the arms move in a forward-backward motion in relation to the trunk. Thus, the overhead press is a good exercise for strengthening the shoulders and arms, but, even though it uses some of the same muscles that are involved in running, it is not directly related to running.|$|E

50|$|Lying triceps {{extensions}}, {{also known}} as skull crushers and French extensions or French presses, are a <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> used in many different forms of strength training. Lying triceps extensions {{are one of the}} most stimulating exercises to the entire triceps muscle group in the upper arm. It works the triceps from the elbow all the way to the latissimus dorsi. Due to its full use of the Triceps muscle group, the lying triceps extensions are used by many as part of their training regimen.|$|E
50|$|Class time is used {{to correct}} any habits {{that could lead to}} injury. If the ballet dancer is {{properly}} trained, the dancer will decrease their risk of injury. Some ballet dancers also turn to stretching or other methods of cross training, like Pilates, Yoga, non impact cardio, and swimming. This, outside cross training, attempts to minimize the risk of bodily damage by increasing <b>strength,</b> <b>exercise</b> diversity, and stamina. Nevertheless, injuries are a common occurrence in performances. Most injuries do not show up until later in a ballet dancer’s life, after years of continuous strain.|$|E
50|$|The first bout {{does not}} need to be as intense as the {{subsequent}} bouts in order to confer at least some protection against soreness. For instance, eccentric exercise performed at 40% of maximal strength has been shown to confer a protection of 20 to 60% from muscle damage incurred by a 100% <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> two to three weeks later. Also, the repeated-bout effect appears even after a relatively small number of contractions, possibly as few as two. In one study, a first bout of 10, 20 or 50 contractions provided equal protection for a second bout of 50 contractions three weeks later.|$|E

50|$|Developing {{physical}} abilities {{specific to}} running, cutting, and jumping technique will have profound results in football-related strength and game performance. In addition, execution of certain specialized exercises requires concentration {{to develop the}} neuromuscular pathway needed. A <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> which duplicates a particular portion of a skill requires ultimate concentration and perseverance to repeat exactly the same movement time after time. This {{does not mean that}} general exercises are of no benefit. They play a very important role in the initial stages of improving a player’s performance. The general exercises precede the specialized exercises to develop a base upon which the special exercises can be performed most effectively. All the advantages of specialized strength work can be realized only with its effective organization.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has clearly}} shown that {{exercise}} is beneficial for spastic muscles, {{even though in}} the very early days of research it was assumed that <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> would increase spasticity. Also, from at least the 1950s through at least the 1980s, there was a strong focus on other interventions for spastic muscles, particularly stretching and splinting, but the evidence does not support these as effective. While splinting is not considered effective for decreasing spasticity, a range of different orthotics are effectively used for preventing muscle contractures on patients with spasticity. In the case of spastic diplegia there is also a permanent neurosurgical treatment for spasticity, selective dorsal rhizotomy, that directly targets nerves in the spine that cause the spasticity, and destroys them, so that the spasticity cannot be activated at all.|$|E
50|$|Specialized {{strength}} {{exercises are}} designed and selected {{so that their}} movements and actions most closely match those required for {{the execution of the}} sport's specific skills. They also promote psychological traits such as decisiveness, willpower, perseverance and confidence to achieve specific goals. They require similar concentration and psychological qualities as those required for competition on the football field. For example, execution of certain specialized exercises requires concentration to develop the neuromuscular pathways needed. Any <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> that duplicates one aspect of a skill requires ultimate concentration and perseverance to repeat exactly the same movement time after time to develop the necessary muscle feel and activate the neuromuscular pathways. For the specialized exercises to have maximum positive transfer, the athlete must be decisive in his or her movements and actions to develop the confidence to repeat the action during play.|$|E
50|$|If <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> are {{not used}} effectively, {{there will be a}} {{disparity}} between the functional levels of the skeletal muscle system and the capabilities of the neuromuscular system.

50|$|In {{addition}} to creating the shock method, Verkhoshansky {{is credited with}} developing the stretch-shortening concept of muscle contractions {{and the development of}} specialized (dynamic correspondence) <b>strength</b> <b>exercises.</b> Plyometrics, or more specifically the shock method, is considered a form of specialized strength development.|$|R
50|$|Specialized <b>strength</b> <b>exercises</b> are {{physical}} exercises used {{to develop}} the physical or psychological qualities that apply directly to a specific sport discipline. These exercises are designed and selected so that the movement and actions closely match those seen in a specific sport.|$|R
50|$|Research {{has clearly}} shown that {{exercise}} is beneficial for impaired muscles, {{even though it}} was previously believed that <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> would increase muscle tone and impair muscle performance further. Also, in previous decades there has been a strong focus on other interventions for impaired muscles, particularly stretching and splinting, but the evidence does not support these as effective. One of the challenges for health professionals working with UMNS movement disorders is that the degree of muscle weakness makes developing an exercise programme difficult. For muscles that lack any volitional control, such as after complete spinal cord injury, exercise may be assisted, and may require equipment, such as using a standing frame to sustain a standing position. Often, muscles require specific stimulation to achieve small amounts of activity, which is most often achieved by weight-bearing (e.g. positioning and supporting a limb such that it supports body weight) or by stimulation to the muscle belly (such as electrical stimulation or vibration).|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effect of a}} carbohydrate restriction program on performance in a bout of isoinertial and isokinetic <b>strength</b> <b>exercise.</b> One female and five male subjects (mean +/- SD: age = 20. 3 +/- 2. 3 years; body mass = 74. 6 +/- 11. 5 kg; height 177. 0 +/- 8. 8 cm) performed isoinertial and isokinetic <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> under control conditions (no experimental intervention) and after a 2 -day carbohydrate restriction program. The carbohydrate restriction program consisted of 60 minutes of cycling at 75 % of peak cycle ergometer oxygen consumption (PVO 2), followed by four 1 -minute bouts at 100 % of PVO 2, followed by 2 days of reduced carbohydrate intake (1. 2 +/- 0. 5 g. kg(- 1). d(- 1)). Isoinertial <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> was three sets of squats with a load of 80 % of one repetition maximum. Isokinetic <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> was five repetitions of leg extensions performed at five different contractile speeds (1. 05, 2. 09, 3. 14, 4. 19, and 5. 24 rad. s(- 1)). The carbohydrate restriction program caused a significant {{reduction in the number of}} squat repetitions performed. Torque at 0. 52 rad from full extension (T 30) was not significantly altered by carbohydrate restriction. Plasma lactate concentration postexercise was significantly lower after carbohydrate restriction. The fact that carbohydrate restriction reduces performance in isoinertial but not isokinetic <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> may be due to the different metabolic demands associated with the different exercise protocols used in the two modes of <b>strength</b> <b>exercise...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{beneficial}} effects of physical exercise on epilepsy, {{such as a}} decreased seizure frequency, have been observed following aerobic exercise programs in both clinical and experimental studies. However, it is not well clarified whether other types of exercise, including <b>strength</b> <b>exercise,</b> can provide similar benefits for epilepsy. Forty four animals with epilepsy were continuously monitored 24 h a day for 60 days and divided into two periods of 30 days. The first period {{was used to determine}} the number of seizures before beginning the physical exercise program, and the second period was utilized to determine the number of seizures during the strength training. The mean frequency of seizures in the control and SHAM groups increased significantly from period 1 to period 2. Although the frequency of seizures did not change significantly between the two periods of 30 days of observation in the <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> group, a significant reduction in the seizure frequency was observed compared with the control and SHAM groups in period 2. Our study demonstrated that a <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> program exerted a significant influence on the seizure frequency in animals with epilepsy and strengthens the observed beneficial effect of exercise on epilepsy that has been demonstrated in animal studies. The finding of this nonclinical study can open a new window to verify the beneficial contribution of <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> in epilepsy. Further experimental and clinical investigations are necessary to explore the extent to which <b>strength</b> <b>exercise</b> interferes with the epileptic condition...|$|E
