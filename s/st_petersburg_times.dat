5|$|Hal Rogers's brother John {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{even though he}} was in state prison serving a sentence for the rape of a woman who had shared his trailer, {{at the time of the}} murders. Police, investigating the woman's rape allegation, found evidence indicating that he had also sexually assaulted Hal's daughter Michelle, although charges involving this assault were later dropped because of her reluctance to testify. The <b>St.</b> <b>Petersburg</b> <b>Times</b> said that John may have planned the murder as he had visited his parents' property near Tampa a month before the murders. However, as the police established John could not have hired a professional killer, did not have accomplices, and could not have known the timing of his sister-in-law's and nieces' trip, he was dismissed as a suspect.|$|E
