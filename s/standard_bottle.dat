50|$|Champagne {{is mostly}} {{fermented}} in two sizes of <b>bottles,</b> <b>standard</b> <b>bottles</b> (750 millilitres) and magnums (1.5 litres). In general, magnums {{are thought to}} be higher quality, as there is less oxygen in the bottle, and the volume-to-surface area ratio favours the creation of appropriately-sized bubbles. However, there is no hard evidence for this view. Other bottle sizes, mostly named for Biblical figures, are generally filled with Champagne that has been fermented in <b>standard</b> <b>bottles</b> or magnums.|$|R

50|$|Springbank Single Malt is {{the most}} popular variety, bearing the name of the {{distillery}} itself. Its <b>standard</b> <b>bottling</b> is a 10-year-old is medium-peated and distilled two and a half times. The <b>standard</b> 10-year-old <b>bottling</b> is available at 46% volume. They also produce a cask-strength 12-year bottling, as well as 15-year, 18-year, and 21-year bottlings. The distillery also releases wine-cask matured editions on a regular basis.|$|R
50|$|The <b>standard</b> <b>bottle</b> cage has two {{mounting}} holes, {{two and a}} half inches (2.5") or 64 mm apart, {{to match}} the threaded holes in the frame, and through which small bolts pass. Some have a strap, adjustable for non standard bottles.|$|E
5000|$|A {{decanter}} is {{a vessel}} {{that is used}} to hold the decantation of a liquid (such as wine) which may contain sediment. Decanters, which have a varied shape and design, have been traditionally made from glass or crystal. Their volume is usually equivalent to one <b>standard</b> <b>bottle</b> of wine (0.75 litre).|$|E
50|$|Reál Sangria {{is sold in}} {{a variety}} of {{different}} sizes. The <b>standard</b> <b>bottle,</b> Reál Sangria red is 750 ML. The Reál Sangria red 4-pack carries 4 individual bottles of 187 ML each. There is also a 1 Litre bottle and a box, which holds 3 Litres of sangria. Each bottle contains 7-10% alcohol per volume.|$|E

40|$|Studies have {{demonstrated}} that large-volume culture methods for sterile body fluids other than blood increase recovery compared to traditional plated-medium methods. BacT/Alert is a fully automated blood culture system for detecting bacteremia and fungemia. In this study, we compared culture in BacT/Alert standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles, BacT/Alert FAN aerobic and FAN anaerobic bottles, and culture on routine media for six specimen types, i. e., continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysate (CAPD), peritoneal, amniotic, pericardial, synovial, and pleural fluids. Specimen volumes were divided equally among the three arms of the study. A total of 1, 157 specimens were tested, with 227 significant isolates recovered from 193 specimens. Recovery by method was as follows: <b>standard</b> <b>bottles,</b> 186 of 227 (82 %); FAN bottles, 217 of 227 (96 %); and routine culture, 184 of 227 (81 %). The FAN bottles recovered significantly more gram-positive cocci (P < 0. 001), Staphylococcus aureus (P = 0. 003), coagulase-negative staphylococci (P = 0. 008), gram-negative bacilli (P < 0. 001), Enterobacteriaceae (P = 0. 005), and total organisms (P < 0. 001) than the routine culture. There {{were no significant differences}} in recovery between the <b>standard</b> <b>bottles</b> and the routine culture. The FAN aerobic bottle recovered significantly more gram-positive cocci (P < 0. 001), S. aureus isolates (P < 0. 001), coagulase-negative staphyococci (P = 0. 003), and total organisms (P < 0. 001) than the <b>standard</b> aerobic <b>bottle,</b> while the FAN anaerobic bottle recovered significantly more gram-positive cocci (P < 0. 001), S. aureus isolates (P < 0. 001), Enterobacteriaceae (P = 0. 03), and total organisms (P < 0. 001) than the <b>standard</b> anaerobic <b>bottle.</b> For specific specimen types, significantly more isolates were recovered from the FAN bottles compared to the routine culture for synovial (P < 0. 001) and CAPD (P = 0. 004) fluids. Overall, the FAN bottles were superior in performance to both the <b>standard</b> <b>bottles</b> and the routine culture for detection of microorganisms from the types of sterile body fluids included in this study...|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{standard}} finishes {{are available for}} aluminium bottlecans {{that are designed to}} work with industry standard closures and caps, in addition to <b>standard</b> <b>bottle</b> filling operations. Some traditional finishes include: 26 mm standard crown cap, 38 mm lug finish, 38 mm continuous thread with plastic sleeve, 38 mm ROPP and 28 mm continuous thread finishes.|$|E

50|$|Longrow Single Malt is a highly-peated, double-distilled whisky, {{named for}} a mothballed {{distillery}} of the same name. The <b>standard</b> <b>bottling</b> bears no age statement, with age-statement-bearing editions experimenting with different casks such as tokaji and Barolo. The Red edition (released annually) uses {{a different type of}} wine cask each year such as Pinot Noir, Malbec, and Port. Longrow won Best Campbeltown Single Malt at the 2013 World Whiskies Awards.|$|R
50|$|A North American {{longneck}} {{is a type}} of {{beer bottle}} with a long neck. It is known as the standard longneck bottle or industry <b>standard</b> <b>bottle</b> (ISB). The ISB longnecks have a uniform capacity, height, weight and diameter and can be reused on average 16 times. The U.S. ISB longneck is 355 ml. In Canada, in 1992, the large breweries all agreed to use a 341 ml longneck bottle of standard design (named AT2), thus replacing the traditional stubby bottle and an assortment of brewery-specific long-necks which had come into use in the mid-1980s.|$|E
5000|$|A naggin in Ireland is a 200 mL {{bottle of}} spirits. Major brands of vodka, whiskey, rum, and less often gin, are {{commonly}} sold in this size in off licences, especially independent (non-chain) shops at a 40% alcohol rate. Naggins {{are more common}} than half-bottles (350 mL, known as a shoulder or Daddy naggin), though for the less popular majority of products neither size is available, only the 700 mL EU <b>standard</b> <b>bottle</b> size. The naggin bottle is typically {{the shape of a}} large hip flask, suitable for placing in a pocket.|$|E
5000|$|Oranżada is a Polish soft drink. It {{dates to}} the 18th century, and came to Poland from France. Its main {{ingredients}} were water, sugar or syrup, and orange juice. In the 19th and 20th centuries an industrial variant of the drink was created, based on powdered juice, and other artificial ingredients. Powdered oranżada was also created in the 20th century. The drink is imported and marketed in the United States by United World Imports. It is called the [...] "Original Formula" [...] on the bottle. The <b>standard</b> <b>bottle</b> size is 20 fl oz (592 ml) {{and it has the}} Polish Coat of Arms on the front.|$|E
5000|$|A cone top (also {{called a}} cap-sealed can, cone-top, or conetop) {{is a type}} of can, {{especially}} a type of beverage can, introduced in 1935. Cone tops were designed in response to flat top beer cans as a hybrid between beer bottle and flat top can. Cone tops were especially attractive to smaller breweries which did not have the capital necessary to buy new canning machinery; cone tops could be filled on <b>standard</b> <b>bottling</b> equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Wine {{is sold in}} <b>standard</b> <b>bottles</b> of 750 mL, as in {{the rest}} of the world. A fifth of liquor, once one-fifth of a U.S. gallon, or 757 mL, is now {{commonly}} 750 mL, though it is still referred to as [...] "a fifth". Beer is sold in fluid ounce denominations. Regulations are set by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau which controls the permissible sizes of containers. Unlike non-alcoholic beverages, most alcohol products are not required to carry unit conversions on labels.|$|R

50|$|Government {{regulations}} {{require that}} all beer sold in Canada show the alcohol by {{volume on the}} label. A <b>standard</b> <b>bottle</b> of beer (12 imperial fl oz or 341 mL and five percent alcohol by volume) which makes 21.6 mL of alcohol (17.05 g). The percentage of alcohol is expressed in mass per volume (g/100 ml) so it means grams of alcohol per 100 ml of solution (fluid in the bottle). It means that a 78.9% alcohol liquid would be pure, meaning only pure ethanol. In most nations, the labelled alcohol percentage is either the average or maximum percentage allowed. However, as of 1927, most Canadian provinces require the minimum alcohol percentage to be labelled rather than the average. This move was meant to eliminate inaccurate nonalcoholic labelling as well as fraudulent advertisement.|$|E
50|$|To begin with, on the Rhine railway, some trains were {{combined}} {{in up to}} four sets and operated using pre-war VT 04 and VT 06 and the new post-war VT 08 diesel multiple units. As well as DMUs, locomotive-hauled trains of 3 to 5 pre-war coaches were also used. These were steel-bodied, standard coaches (Einheitswagen) of various types. The interiors of the compartments and corridors of these coaches were refurbished and given new carpets. The external livery was changed from the <b>standard</b> <b>bottle</b> green to steel blue (RAL 5011). In addition the words Deutsche Bundesbahn or, if the coaches were only used on domestic routes, the initials DB were mounted on the sides in silver letters. In all at least 76 coaches were converted for this role. They included the coaches from the Henschel-Wegmann train.|$|E
50|$|In 2012 wine & spirits expert Shammi Shinh {{launched}} Prodiguer Brands {{and released}} the worlds most expensive champagne label - Goût de Diamants. A limited edition bottle worth $1.9 million USD was released mid 2013 according to Forbes, {{making it the}} single most expensive champagne bottle in the world. Also reported by Celebrity Net Worth. As well as creating the brand, Shinh is also the designer of the bottle. For the <b>standard</b> <b>bottle</b> he used pewter labels and Swarovski diamond cut crystals. When creating the limited edition bottle, Shinh replicated his exact design but this time using precious materials such as white gold and a real diamond.After news went viral surrounding the limited edition bottle, celebrities {{from around the world}} expressed interest in associating themselves with the brand, including Usain Bolt, One Direction and The Kardashians. In 2014 the limited edition bottle was featured on VH1's Fabulous Life of Holiday Superspenders.|$|E

50|$|The Keglon bottle is a 14-liter bottle. It is {{equivalent}} to 18.7 <b>standard</b> <b>bottles.</b> Like many bottles sizes above 3 liters in volume, which are traditionally named after Biblical Kings, the Keglon is named after King Eglon, from the Book of Judges (3:12).The bottle has a bore (inner neck) diameter of 28.5mm {{at the mouth of}} the bottle and increase to 47,67 mm before expanding into the full bottle. The bottle is 544mm high and 207mm at its widest point.Created in 2016 by Mike Bouchet, the bottle shape thus far has been produced in hand blown glass due to its irregular size.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the 2007 provincial {{election}} campaign, The Brick Brewing Company of Waterloo made headlines when it claimed The Beer Store engaged in a number of discriminatory practices and policies, such as restrictions on price advertising, for causing a decline in company sales. TBS representatives denied that their policies are hurting small brewers and implicitly questioned the timing of the Brick Brewing Company's statement, suggesting that in their view it is unethical for a brewery to use an electoral campaign to forward self-interests. Additionally, Brick claimed that TBS allegedly used monopolistic tactics to force what is now Ontario's largest independent brewer to stop offering beer in [...] "Stubbies" [...] by withholding supplies of industry standard [...] "long-necked" [...] bottles. The Beer Store claimed that Brick signed an agreement in 1992 to use the industry <b>standard</b> <b>bottle</b> and Brick said it never signed such an agreement. This dispute was settled out of court with the terms of the settlement undisclosed. Brick has since stopped selling beer in [...] "stubbies" [...] because the cost was too high.|$|E
5000|$|The Harvey {{flamethrower}} {{was introduced}} in August 1940, it was made mostly made from readily available parts such as wheels from agricultural equipment manufacturers and commercially available compressed air cylinders. It comprised a welded steel cylinder containing 22 gallons (100 l) of creosote and a <b>standard</b> <b>bottle</b> of compressed nitrogen at [...] mounted on a sack truck of the type that a railway station porter might use. 25 ft of armoured hose provided the connection to a 4 ft lance with a nozzle and some paraffin soaked cotton waste that was set alight to provide a source of ignition. In operation, the pressure in the fuel container was raised to about [...] causing a cork in the nozzle to be ejected followed by a jet of fuel lasting about 10 seconds at a range of up to 60 ft. Like the Home Guard Flame Thrower, it was intended as an ambush weapon, {{but in this case}} the operator was able to direct the flames by moving the lance which would be pushed through a hole in otherwise bullet proof cover such as a brick wall.|$|E
40|$|A multisurface glass {{roller bottle}} has been {{constructed}} {{for the growth}} of animal cells in culture. This bottle contains five concentrically placed glass cylinders that provide additional surfaces {{for the growth of}} animal cells. The bottle occupies the same space as a standard roller bottle, but it contains nine times the surface area of a <b>standard</b> <b>bottle.</b> L and HeLa cells can be grown in the bottle with cell yields 5 - to 10 -fold greater than in a <b>standard</b> <b>bottle.</b> L cells can be induced to produce interferon in the multisurface bottle...|$|E

In a controlled clinical evalu-ation performed at four university-affiliated hospitals, FAN anaerobic bottles {{were compared with}} <b>standard</b> anaerobic <b>bottles</b> for yield, speed of detection of microbial growth, and detection of septic episodes. A total of 10, 431 blood culture sets were received; both anaerobic bottles of 7, 694 blood culture sets were adequately filled with blood. Altogether, 925 isolates were recovered: 557 that were the cause of sepsis, 99 that were indeter-minate {{as the cause of}} sepsis, and 269 contaminants.

40|$|The {{goal was}} to {{visually}} evaluate the effect gravity has on delivery of medications {{by the use of}} various aerosol devices. During parabolic flight the same four aerosols were retested as performed in studio ground tests. It appears that the Cetacaine spray and the Ventolin inhaler function without failure during all test. The pump spray (Nostril) appeared to function normally when the container was full, however it appeared to begin to fail to deliver a full mist with larger droplet size when the container was nearly empty. The simple hand spray bottle appeared to work when the container was full and performed progressively worse as the container was emptied. During Apollo flights, it was reported that <b>standard</b> spray <b>bottles</b> did not work well, however, they did not indicate why. It appears that we would also conclude that <b>standard</b> spray <b>bottles</b> do not function as well in zero gravity by failing to produce a normal mist spray. The <b>standard</b> spray <b>bottle</b> allowed the fluid to come out in a narrow fluid stream when held with the nozzle either level or slightly tilted upward...|$|R
