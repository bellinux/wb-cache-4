5|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of a}} typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue <b>sample</b> and scans the <b>sample</b> in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue <b>sample</b> is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of <b>sample.</b> X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the <b>sample</b> at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.|$|E

In particular, we derive {{the capacity of}} <b>sampled</b> analog channels over a general class of time-preserving <b>sampling</b> methods including irregular nonuniform <b>sampling.</b> Our {{results indicate that the}} optimal <b>sampling</b> structures extract out the set of frequencies that exhibits the highest SNR among all spectral sets of support size equal to the <b>sampling</b> rate. The capacity under sub-Nyquist <b>sampling</b> can be attained through filter-bank <b>sampling,</b> or through a single branch of modulation and filtering followed by uniform <b>sampling.</b> The capacity under sub-Nyquist <b>sampling</b> is a monotone function of the <b>sampling</b> rate. These results indicate that the optimal <b>sampling</b> schemes suppress aliasing, and that employing irregular nonuniform <b>sampling</b> does not provide capacity gain over uniform <b>sampling</b> sets with appropriate preprocessing for a large class of channels.

25|$|How the <b>sample</b> and matrix is {{deposited}} {{on the surface}} of the <b>sample</b> probe needs to be a consideration in <b>sample</b> preparation as well. The dried drop method is the simplest of deposition methods. The matrix and <b>sample</b> solution are mixed together and then a small drop of the mixture is placed on the <b>sample</b> probe surface and allowed to dry, thus crystallizing. The sandwich method involves depositing a layer of matrix onto the surface of the probe and allowing it to dry. A drop of the <b>sample</b> followed by a drop of additional matrix is then applied to the layer of dried matrix and allowed to dry as well. Variations on the sandwich technique involve depositing the matrix on the surface and then depositing the <b>sample</b> directly on top of the matrix. A particularly useful method involves depositing the matrix solution {{on the surface of}} the <b>sample</b> probe in a solvent that will evaporate very rapidly, thus forming a very thin fine layer of matrix. The <b>sample</b> solution is then placed on top of the matrix layer and allowed to evaporate slowly, thus integrating the <b>sample</b> into the top layer of matrix as the <b>sample</b> solution evaporates. An addition concern when depositing the <b>sample</b> {{on the surface of the}} probe is the solubility of the <b>sample</b> in the matrix. If the <b>sample</b> is insoluble in the matrix, additional methods must be employed. A method used in this case involves mechanical grinding and mixing of solid <b>sample</b> and solid matrix crystals. Once blended well, this powder can be {{deposited on}} the surface of the <b>sample</b> probe in free powder form or as a pill. Another possible method is placing the <b>sample</b> on the surface of the probe and applying vaporized matrix to the <b>sample</b> probe to allow the matrix to condense around the <b>sample.</b>|$|E
