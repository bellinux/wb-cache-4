It {{is part of a}} sketch in outline {{of the history of the}} past. 'The important thing,' he says, is to 'fix the turning-point of the history of Europe.' While he was at it he might just as well have fixed the equator of the history of Europe and its <b>sparking-plug</b> and the position of its liver. Now, listen-- ...|$|E
60|$|The latter said {{something}} about a <b>sparking-plug,</b> and when Daly stooped over the engine {{the light of a}} lamp shone into his face. He was a big, handsome man, but Foster, studying him closely, noted his hard and greedy eyes. For a moment, he came near forgetting the need for caution and giving way to a fit of rage. The fellow had it in his power to bring disgrace upon upright people and drag an honored name in the mire. He could humble Alice Featherstone's pride and ruin the brother she loved.|$|E
5000|$|The 1926 Lightweight TT Race {{produced}} one of {{the most}} notorious events in the history of the Isle of Man TT Races, described by the [...] "The Motor-Cycle" [...] Magazine as the [...] "Guzzi Incident." [...] The Italian rider Pietro Ghersi was excluded from second place for using a different <b>sparking-plug</b> in the engine of his Moto Guzzi. Despite the competition from the Italian marques the 1926 Lighweight TT Race was won by 'Paddy' Johnston riding a Cotton motor-cycle, in 4 hours, 23 minutes and 16 seconds, at an average speed of 60.24 mph for the 7 lap race.|$|E

They are both internaI, intermittent combustion engines. ln diesel engines, the fuel is self-ignited as it is injected into air that has been heated by compression. ln gasoline engines, the fuel is ignited by <b>sparking-plugs.</b> The fuels used in diesel {{and gasoline}} engines also differ, wit...|$|R
5000|$|I {{immediately}} {{ordered the}} latest and most well-proven microlight, a Pegasus Quantum 912. It had a lovely flying wing, with which I was comfortable, and its engine — a Rotax 912 — was four-stroke, four-cylinder, and much more reliable than the two-stroke, two-cylinder engines I had flown until then. It also had dual ignition, two <b>sparking-plugs</b> in each cylinder, a comfort on sea crossings. Even though Keith flew as a test pilot for the rival Medway Microlights, which had a lovely wing too, but a less advanced trike, he was in favour of {{the choice of a}} Pegasus 912.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very clear}} to me that the {{insensibility}} which came upon Glaisher, and in a lesser degree upon Coxwell, when, in 1862, they ascended in a balloon to the height of thirty thousand feet, was due to the extreme speed with which a perpendicular ascent is made. Doing it at an easy gradient and accustoming oneself to the lessened barometric pressure by slow degrees, there are no such dreadful symptoms. At the same great height I found that even without my oxygen inhaler I could breathe without undue distress. It was bitterly cold, however, and my thermometer was at zero Fahrenheit. At one-thirty I was nearly seven miles above the surface of the earth, and still ascending steadily. I found, however, that the rarefied air was giving markedly less support to my planes, and that my angle of ascent had to be considerably lowered in consequence. It was already clear that even with my light weight and strong engine-power there was a point in front of me where I should be held. To make matters worse, one of my <b>sparking-plugs</b> was in trouble again and there was intermittent missfiring in the engine. My heart was heavy with the fear of failure.|$|R
