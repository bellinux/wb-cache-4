40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design, build, and test {{an example of the}} seal invented by the author for use on Space Station Freedom and {{patented}} in 1991. The seal features a metallic <b>spring</b> <b>core</b> and replaceable elastomeric sealing elements. The metallic spring is designed to retain the sealing force of the elastomeric element against both sides of face seal gland for any specified amount of waviness or separation of the glands. A seal able to tolerate at least 1. 3 mm (0. 05 in) of flange distortion or separation and a test fixture of this seal which allowed direct comparison testing of O-rings were built. These designs were tested to compare leakage at different amounts of flange deflection. Results of the testing show the development seal exceeded its requirement to seal 1. 3 mm of flange separation by 1 mm. This compared with the O-ring leakage, increasing dramatically at 0. 5 mm of separation. The development seal also leaked at a lower rate than the O-ring seals in all tests...|$|E

A soil sample from Gulu was incubated at different temperatures and analyzed for changes in iGDGTs to help evaluate whether surrounding soil {{may contribute to the}} iGDGTs in hot springs. The sources of bacterial GDGTs (bGDGTs) in these hot springs were also investigated. The results revealed different profiles of iGDGTs between Gulu and Yangbajing hot <b>springs.</b> <b>Core</b> iGDGTs and polar iGDGTs also presented different patterns in each hot spring. The PCA analysis showed that the structure of polar iGDGTs can be explained by three factors and suggested multiple sources of these compounds. Bivariate correlation analysis showed significant positive correlations between polar and core bGDGTs, suggesting the in situ production of bGDGTs in the hot springs. Furthermore, in the soil incubation experiment, temperature had the most significant influence on concentration of bGDGTs rather than iGDGTs, and polar bGDGTs had greater variability than core bGDGTs with changing temperature. Our results indicated that soil input had little influence on the composition of GDGTs in Tibetan hot springs. On the other hand, ring index and TEX 86 values were both positively correlated with incubation temperature, suggesting that the structure of archaeal lipids changed in response to varying temperature during incubation...|$|R

50|$|To {{simplify the}} sealing issues, the plugnut, <b>core,</b> <b>springs,</b> shading ring, and other {{components}} are often {{exposed to the}} fluid, so they must be compatible as well. The requirements present some special problems. The core tube needs to be non-magnetic to pass the solenoid's field through to the plugnut and the core. The plugnut and core need a material with good magnetic properties such as iron, but iron is prone to corrosion. Stainless steels can be used because they come in both magnetic and non-magnetic varieties. For example, a solenoid valve might use 304 stainless steel for the body, 305 stainless steel for the core tube, 302 stainless steel for the springs, and 430 F stainless steel (a magnetic stainless steel) for the core and plugnut.|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of the ranging {{behavior}} and spatial {{requirements of a}} species is fundamental for establishing meaningful conservation strategies. Such information is lacking for the middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos medius), a species endangered throughout its westpalearctic range. By radiotracking, we studied spacing behavior of this habitat specialist in a lowland oak forest of northeastern Switzerland from 1992 - 1996. Home range and core area size decreased from winter to late spring, with males and females having home ranges of similar size. Overlap of male home ranges was highest in winter (up to 40 %) and lowest in late <b>spring,</b> whereas <b>core</b> area overlap remained low. For both home ranges and core areas, overlapping parts were used randomly in winter {{but more often than}} expected in early spring. Overlap of female ranges and of core areas did not change from early to late spring, and the shared parts of these home ranges were used as expected in both seasons. Aggressive interactions were most common in March and April and occurred mainly between individuals of the same sex. Our results suggest that the middle spotted woodpecker is not territorial in winter but defends nearly exclusive territories during spring, with both sexes participating to similar degrees in territorial defense. Based on this seasonal territoriality, we propose consideration of core areas in early spring (Mar and Apr) as a reliable estimate of the area requirements of the species to be used in management plans...|$|R
40|$|A {{solenoid valve}} is {{described}} in which both an inlet and an outlet of the valve are sealed when the valve is closed.

40|$|Among several {{mathematical}} {{models for}} predicting the mechanical response of a helical wire strand to axisymmetric tension and torque derived {{in the literature}} over five decades, purely tensile wire linear elastic models have the symmetry of a stiffness matrix. Curiously, in those models where wire bending and torsion terms were included {{there was a lack}} of symmetry. In this paper the origin of the lack of symmetry in the earlier models has been identified and a symmetric model developed. The correct generalized strains for this purpose were derived using Wempner’s theory and verified using Ramsey’s theory. The validity of this model has been verified by comparing its results with that of earlier models and experiments available. This linear elastic symmetric model brings forth the much needed agree-ment between the global (strand) and the local (wire) responses which should help to simplify considerably the analysis of multi-layer strands and multi-strand wire ropes.

40|$|Lodging-related traits were {{evaluated}} on the CIMMYT <b>Core</b> <b>spring</b> wheat Germplasm Panel (CIMCOG) in the Yaqui Valley of North-West Mexico during three seasons (2010 – 2013). Genetic variation {{was significant for}} all the lodging-related traits in the cross-year analysis, however, significant G × E interaction due to rank changes or changes in the absolute differences between cultivars were identified. The inconsistences on cultivar performances across seasons particularly reduced the heritability of key characters related to root lodging resistance (anchorage strength). Target characters related to stem lodging resistance (stem strength) showed good heritability values equal or above 0. 70. Positive correlations between stem strength and stem diameter and between root plate spread and root strength were found. Selecting for greater stem diameter and wall width, greater root plate spread and shorter plant height could enable breeders to increase lodging resistance by increasing stem strength, root strength and decreasing plant leverage, respectively. Achieving a lodging-proof crop will depend on finding a wider root plate spread and implementing new management strategies. Genetic linkages between lodging traits will not constrain {{the combination of the}} key lodging-trait dimensions to achieve a lodging-proof ideotype.
