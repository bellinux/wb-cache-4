5|$|In France, saffron {{production}} {{became very}} important in the 17th and 18th centuries, reaching a few tons. By then, saffron farming had <b>spread</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> entire Kingdom. Saffron was especially grown in Albigeois, Angoumois, Gascony, Gâtinais, Normandy, Périgord, Poitou, Provence, and Quercy. Its mysterious decline started during the 18th century, possibly due to pandemic fungal diseases destroying bulbs and crops, to particularly cold winters, and to competing market from the Mediterranean countries.|$|E

5|$|Lumber thus {{became one}} of the leading {{industries}} in Pennsylvania. Trees were used to furnish fuel to heat homes, tannin for the many tanneries that were <b>spread</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> state, and wood for construction, furniture, and barrel making. Large areas of forest were harvested by colliers to fire iron furnaces. Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber, as were a wide variety of household utensils, and the first Conestoga wagons.|$|E

5|$|New villages appeared, {{consisting}} of timber houses built {{side by side}} in equal parcels of land. For instance, the scarcely inhabited forests of the Western Carpathians (in present-day Slovakia) developed a network of settlements under Béla IV.
