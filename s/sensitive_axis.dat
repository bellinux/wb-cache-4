This paper presents an approach to improve the measurement accuracy of GMR sensors using a closed-loop circuit, which includes the sensor, a biasing coil, and a feedback circuit. The current in the biasing coil is actively changed {{to ensure that the}} component of magnetic field along the <b>sensitive</b> <b>axis</b> of the device is held constant, so that as the external magnetic field or orientation of the GMR sensor changes, the output of GMR sensor remains stable. In this way, the external magnetic field component along the <b>sensitive</b> <b>axis</b> of the device can be calculated by measuring the current in the biasing coil surrounding the GMR sensor, regardless of the hysteresis and nonlinearly of GMR sensor.

In the course of experiments, FOG was placed into a hermetic chamber. The atmosphere pressure was varying {{in the range from}} 0. 8 to 1. 5 atm. All the data, including the FOG output signal, temperature, and data from the pressure sensor installed inside the FOG, were synchronously registered with the computer software. The separation of scale factor change from zero offset in the experiment was carried out by setting the <b>sensitive</b> FOG <b>axis</b> at 0 °, 90 ° and 270 ° relative to the East (the FOG was set perpendicular to the horizon). After the data processing it was concluded that the FOG signal error associated with the pressure affects mainly on the additive component. The pressure effect on the multiplicative component appeared to be negligible at rotational velocities used in the experiment (0 - 130 /h). At the same time, the FOG signal has a high linear correlation coefficient with the derivative of pressure over time (in some cases, more than 0. 9). The experiment was repeated several times and the high degree of the drift repeatability was shown. That makes it possible to implement the compensation algorithm.

40|$|Two-dimensional optical strain {{measurements}} on {{high temperature test}} specimens are presented. This two-dimensional capability is implemented through a rotatable <b>sensitive</b> strain <b>axis.</b> Three components of surface strain can be measured automatically, from which {{the first and second}} principal strains are calculated. One- and two-dimensional strain measurements at temperatures beyond 750 C with a resolution of 15 microstrain are demonstrated. The system is based on a one-dimensional speckle shift technique. The speckle shift technique makes use of the linear relationship between surface strain and the differential shift of laser speckle patterns in the diffraction plane. Laser speckle is a phase effect that occurs when spatially coherent light interacts with an optically rough surface. Since speckle is generated by any diffusely reflecting surface, no specimen preparation is needed to obtain a good signal. Testing was done at room temperature on a flat specimen of Inconel 600 mounted in a fatigue testing machine. A load cell measured the stress on the specimen before and after acquiring the speckle data. Strain components were measured at 0 C (parallel to the load axis) and at plus or minus 45 C, and plots indicate the calculated values of the first and second principal strains. The measured values of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are in good agreement with handbook values. Good linearity of the principal strain moduli at high temperatures indicate precision and stability of the system. However, a systematic error in the high-temperature test setup introduced a scale factor in the slopes of the two-dimensional stress-strain curves. No high temperature effects, however, have been observed to degrade speckle correlation...|$|R

40|$|Finding an {{efficient}} and compelling regularization of soft and collinear {{degrees of freedom}} at the same invariant mass scale, but separated in rapidity is a persistent problem in high-energy factorization. In {{the course of a}} calculation, one encounters divergences unregulated by dimensional regularization, often called rapidity divergences. Once regulated, a general framework exists for their renormalization, the rapidity renormalization group (RRG), leading to fully resummed calculations of transverse momentum (to the jet <b>axis)</b> <b>sensitive</b> quantities. We examine how this regularization can be implemented via a multi-differential factorization of the soft-collinear phase-space, leading to an (in principle) alternative non-perturbative regularization of rapidity divergences. As an example, we examine the fully-differential factorization of a color singlet's momentum spectrum in a hadron-hadron collision at threshold. We show how this factorization acts as a mother theory to both traditional threshold and transverse momentum resummation, recovering the classical results for both resummations. Examining the refactorization of the transverse momentum beam functions in the threshold region, we show that one can directly calculate the rapidity renormalized function, while shedding light on the structure of joint resummation. Finally, we show how using modern bootstrap techniques, the transverse momentum spectrum is determined by an expansion about the threshold factorization, leading to a viable higher loop scheme for calculating the relevant anomalous dimensions for the transverse momentum spectrum...|$|R

The tri-axial OARE raw acceleration measurements (i. e., telemetered data) during the interval were filtered using a sliding trimmed mean filter in order to remove large acceleration spikes (e. g., thrusters) and reduce the noise. Twelve OARE measured biases in each acceleration channel during the 2 -day interval were analyzed and applied to the filtered data. Similarly, the in situ measured x-axis scale factors in the sensor's most sensitive range were also analyzed and applied to the data.

These measures of noise will also be in units of deg/sec. Noise can also be defined as a function of frequency using a power spectral density (PSD) or Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In these cases, the noise specification will be a noise density in deg/sec/Hz 1 / 2 or (deg/sec) 2 /Hz that describes the output noise {{as a function of the}} bandwidth of the sensors.

The work analyses hydrodynamic and electromagnetic noise at the input of transducer with "rotating" <b>sensitive</b> <b>axis.</b> By virtue of matching the measuring electrodes with the signal processing circuit a conclusion has been drawn that the proposed basic model of a transducer with "rotating” <b>sensitive</b> <b>axis</b> is the most efficient in terms of enhancement and measurement of modulated signal from the baseband noise. It has been shown that it is undesirable for transducers to have the rotation of electrodes resulting, in this case, in arising noise to be synchronously changed with transducer rotation frequency (modulation frequency).

The paper justifies the choice of demodulation output signal, called synchronous demodulation using a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency much lower than the carrier frequency to provide an output signal in the range of very low frequency and dc electric fields. The paper offers an original circuit to process the signals taken from the modulation sensor with "rotating" measurement base.

40|$|Even {{when the}} Global Positioning System (GPS) signal is blocked, a rate {{gyroscope}} (gyro) north finder {{is capable of}} providing the required azimuth reference information to a certain extent. In order to measure the azimuth between the observer and the north direction very accurately, we propose a multi-position non-continuous rotation gyro north finding scheme. Our new generalized mathematical model analyzes the elements that affect the azimuth measurement precision and can thus provide high precision azimuth reference information. Based on the gyro’s principle of detecting a projection of the earth rotation rate on its <b>sensitive</b> <b>axis</b> and the proposed north finding scheme, {{we are able to}} deduct an accurate mathematical model of the gyro outputs against azimuth with the gyro and shaft misalignments. Combining the gyro outputs model and the theory of propagation of uncertainty, some approaches to optimize north finding are provided, including reducing the gyro bias error, constraining the gyro random error, increasing the number of rotation points, improving rotation angle measurement precision, decreasing the gyro and the shaft misalignment angles. According them, a north finder setup is built and the azimuth uncertainty of 18 ” is obtained. This paper provides systematic theory for analyzing the details of the gyro north finder scheme from simulation to implementation. The proposed theory can guide both applied researchers in academia and advanced practitioners in industry for designing high precision robust north finder based on different types of rate gyroscopes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Patients {{who have}} inabilities in {{movements}} {{will get a}} much better life by using electronic supports for their daily needs. The aim of this work is to implement wheel chair direction control with hand gesture reorganization. This paper proposes an integrated approach to real time detection, tracking and direction recognition of hands, which {{is intended to be}} used as a human-robot interaction interface for the intelligent wheelchair. This paper demonstrates that accelerometers can be used to effectively translate finger and hand gestures into computer interpreted signals. For gesture recognition the accelerometer data is calibrated and filtered. The accelerometers can measure the magnitude and direction of gravity in addition to movement induced acceleration. In order to calibrate the accelerometers, we rotate the device’s <b>sensitive</b> <b>axis</b> with respect to gravity and use the resultant signal as an absolute measurement. In this project automatic controls are incorporated in a wheelchair. All the electronic gadgets in patient’s room can be controlled by certain gestures from the patient. The signals for room automation are communicated through Zigbee modules. Also there is an emergency call alert system in the wheelchair. For that GSM modules are used. For the wheelchair control we use a 3 axis accelerometer, which effectively translate finger and hand gestures into computer interpreted signals. Integrating a single chip wireless solution with a MEMS accelerometer would yield an autonomous device small enough to apply to the fingernails because of their small size and weight.
