A nomen can be any expression of a thema. Ideally there will exist an authority file with every possible subject/thema. This means {{that it should be}} possible to exchange subject authority data between systems. If a user looks up a specific subject in a catalog and wants to look in other places, he or she should not have to worry about translating the query, since the system would be able to recognize the underlying thema and automatically translate it into the relevant nomen. One way to understand this is to think about how a subject can be described in different ways. For example, if one looks at a work about the city Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, there are many ways to describe Stockholm. First, one must distinguish between the city Stockholm and the many other meanings of the word; for example, Stockholm is also the name of other cities, a record label, and a syndrome. When the thema is established in an authority file, it is possible to translate across systems. The nomen for Stockholm could be anything from [...] "Stockholm", [...] "Stockholm (City)", [...] "Tukholma" [...] - the Finnish spelling of Stockholm - or a range of Zip-codes, or the longitude and latitude, or a picture of the city, or a sound. FRSAR, if implemented, enables users to perform specific and precise <b>subject</b> <b>searching</b> across multiple systems.|$|E

40|$|Searching {{behaviour}} in {{a university}} library is studied using a holistic approach encompassing the use of bibliographic tools and browsing at the shelves. The project {{was designed as a}} `before and after' study to evaluate the impact of an online catalogue on <b>subject</b> <b>searching</b> behaviour. A combined methodology was devised using a talk-aloud technique, observation, and screen logging facility to elicit both verbal and non-verbal data from users in their searching activity at the manual bibliographic tools, including a microfiche catalogue and printed PRECIS index and at the online catalogue, {{as well as at the}} shelves. The data was recorded on a highly structured dual questionnaire and observation form with some real time expert interpretation. The limitations of the methodological approach of previous catalogue use studies are highlighted suggesting that <b>subject</b> <b>searching</b> as a basic primary need had been previously underestimated. The online catalogue does not seem to have increased the extent of <b>subject</b> <b>searching</b> nor the use of the bibliographic tool. An extensive qualitative analysis correlating expressed topics, search formulation strategies and documents retrieved at the shelves reveals the adaptive nature of the <b>subject</b> <b>searching</b> process, whereby the user adapts to the structure of the tools available. The PRECIS index supports a contextual approach for broad search formulations and more interactive reformulations whereas the OPAC encouraged a matching approach and narrow formulations with fewer but user generated reformulations. The success rate of the online catalogue was slightly better than that for the PRECIS index but fewer items were retrieved at the shelves. Nonusers of the bibliographic tools seemed to be just as successful. The information retrieval task in both searching environments is tailored by the system to a single one dimensional sequential process. It is suggested that a major obstacle to <b>subject</b> <b>searching</b> effectiveness may lie in the lack of interaction between the different subject access elements: the indexing language, the classification and the titles. The study concludes that to improve retrieval effectiveness online catalogues should cater for both matching and contextual approaches to searching. Recent research indicates that a more interactive process could be promoted by providing query expansion through a combination of searching aids for matching, for search formulation assistance-and for structured contextual retrieval...|$|E

40|$|Understanding and {{improving}} <b>subject</b> <b>searching</b> in online library catalogues {{is the focus}} of this study. Against the backdrop of current research and developments in online catalogues an analysis of the problems and prospects for subject access in the expanding online catalogue is presented. Developments in recent information retrieval theory and practice are reviewed, and a case is made for a new model of information seeking and retrieval that more closely describes much of the <b>subject</b> <b>searching</b> and browsing activity actually conducted by library users. The center piece of this study is the experiment that was conducted using an experimental online catalogue developed to investigate and evaluate the effect of alternative browse and navigate search methods on overall retrieval effectiveness and <b>subject</b> <b>searching</b> performance. The objectives, methodology, and findings of this online catalogue search experiment are discussed. The primary aim of the experimental study was to evaluate the usability and retrieval performance of a pre-structured "navigation" approach to <b>subject</b> <b>searching</b> and browsing in library catalogues. The main hypothesis tested was that the provision and use of a navigation search and browse function would significantly improve overall OPAC retrieval effectiveness and the <b>subject</b> <b>searching</b> performance of OPAC users. The OPAC used in the study was designed and implemented by this author using the database management and retrieval software known as "TiNMAN", provided by Information Management & Engineering, Ltd. TINMAN employs an entity-relational database structure which permits the linking of any field in the stored bibliographic record to any other field. These linkages establish browse and navigation pathways among data fields ("entities") and citations to support guided but flexible searching and browsing through the collection by users. Thus, a rudimentary form of hypertext is provided for the users of the OPAC. The test database consisted of 30, 000 Library of Congress MARC bibliographic records selected at random from all LC catalog records for publications through 1988 in the English language in the LC classes HB-HJ (Economics, Business, etc.). For each record, the verbal description of the assigned LC class number found in the printed schedules was added as a subject descriptor to augment the subject cataloging provided by the Library of Congress. Three different OPACs were tested for comparison purposes. The control OPAC lacked the navigation feature. The other two OPACs supported related-record navigation, one on title words only, the other on subject headings only. Searchers were encouraged to use the OPAC's features and search options in whatever manner they wished. Subjects in Group-I were permitted to navigate only on the subject headings from the controlled subject vocabulary assigned to the work cited (augmented by the verbal meanings of the Library of Congress class number). Subjects in Group- 2 were permitted to navigate, but only from title words of the work cited and displayed. Navigating from one of these title words would result in the retrieval of all works whose titles had at least one occurrence of the selected word. Subjects in the control group were not permitted to navigate; that is, it was not possible for them to point to a selected data element in a displayed citation to move on to related terms or citations associated with that data element. The positive value of related-record navigation in improving <b>subject</b> <b>searching</b> in OPACs was not clearly determined. The navigation groups performed significantly better than the control groupon the first search task, but all three groups performed nearly equally well on the second search task. Navigation on subject headings or title keywords resulted in higher recall scores, especially among first time, novice users of the system, but precision suffered significantly in title-word navigation. In fact, the control group achieved higher precision scores on both search tasks. Navigation did not seem to aid <b>subject</b> <b>searching</b> performance after greater familiarity with the system was achieved, except perhaps to increase recall in persistent searches without much decrease in precision. Online bookshelf browsing seems to improve recall without a significant decrease in precision, and may be a more positive factor than navigation on either subject headings or title words...|$|E

This result is widely accepted as evidence that a serial selfterminating search is necessary to detect conjunctions. In Experiment 1 of the present study, the <b>subjects</b> <b>searched</b> for a conjunction target (a green T) in displays of 2, 4, or 8 items. Positive and negative displaysize slopes were essentially the same in this range. In Experiment 2, the <b>subjects</b> <b>searched</b> for conjunction targets in displays of 2 to 24 items. In displays of 2 to 8 items, {{the positive and negative}} slopes were again comparable and the 2 : 1 ratio was again rejected. In displays of 8 to 24 items, on the other hand, the negative slopes were approximately twice the positive slopes. The same result was obtained in Experiment 3, which was modeled after the conjunction search experiment of Egeth, Virzi, and Garbart (1984). In summary, a 2 : 1 slope ratio appears to describe the function quite well in the range above 8 items (or if display size is coarsely sampled, as in previous research), but not in the lower range, in which the true ratio is closer to 1 : 1. These nearly parallel functions in the lower range probably do not, however, reflect a serial exhaustive search: in Experiment 4, positive reaction times were substantially reduced when redundant targets were added to the display.
