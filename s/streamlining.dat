40|$|Many {{computer}} aided diagnosis (CAD) schemes {{have been}} developed for colon cancer detection using Virtual Colonoscopy (VC). In earlier work, we developed an automatic polyp detection method integrating flow visualization techniques, that forms part of the CAD functionality of an existing Virtual Colonoscopy pipeline.

During testing with a large number of patient data sets, we found that the correlation between <b>streamline</b> features and true polyps could be affected by noise and our <b>streamline</b> generation technique. The seeding and spacing constraints and CT noise could lead to <b>streamline</b> fragmentation, which reduced the discriminating power of our <b>streamline</b> features. In this paper, we present two major improvements of our curvature <b>streamline</b> generation.

30|$|<b>Streamline</b> {{numerical}} simulation {{is widely used}} as an important means to characterize fluid flow paths and describe {{the intensity of the}} flow field during the development of an oil field. By establishing the pressure equation on the grid and quadrature of the <b>streamline,</b> we can get the corresponding pressure equipotential surface and establish a natural migration network. The fluid moves along the <b>streamline,</b> so as to track the migration of oil, gas, and water in the reservoir. Compared with the traditional finite difference {{numerical simulation}} method, modern reservoir <b>streamline</b> simulation in many aspects has achieved great breakthroughs, such as the Pollock <b>streamline</b> tracing method (Jackson et al. 1988), data transfer method between the network and grid (Batycky et al. 1997), and the history matching method based on <b>streamline</b> simulation (Wang 2002). Thiele and Batycky (2003) established water injection optimization model by <b>streamline</b> numerical simulation technology. Cheng et al.

However, the current <b>streamline</b> field simulation can only qualitatively judge the distribution of the current flow field by the <b>streamline</b> density in each area of the reservoir; it cannot quantitatively evaluate the <b>streamline</b> field.

40|$|Abstract—Most <b>streamline</b> {{generation}} algorithms either {{provide a}} particular density of <b>streamlines</b> across the domain or explicitly detect features, such as critical points, and follow customized rules to emphasize those features. However, the former generally includes many redundant <b>streamlines,</b> {{and the latter}} requires Boolean decisions on which points are features (and may thus suffer from robustness problems for real-world data). We take {{a new approach to}} adaptive <b>streamline</b> placement for steady vector fields in 2 D and 3 D. We define a metric for local similarity among <b>streamlines</b> and use this metric to grow <b>streamlines</b> from a dense set of candidate seed points. The metric considers not only Euclidean distance, but also a simple statistical measure of shape and directional similarity. Without explicit feature detection, our method produces <b>streamlines</b> that naturally accentuate regions of geometric interest. In conjunction with this method, we also propose a quantitative error metric for evaluating a <b>streamline</b> representation based on how well it preserves the information from the original vector field. This error metric reconstructs a vector field from points on the <b>streamline</b> representation and computes a difference of the reconstruction from the original vector field.
