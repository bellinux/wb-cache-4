5|$|The video {{opens with}} shots of a dank {{underground}} sewer. <b>Stevens</b> <b>and</b> {{a group of}} women walk through the sewer and put on sunglasses before climbing out of manholes and shafts. A large crowd of women, with Stevens leading them, parades down the streets as men observe the spectacle. The women begin spraying each other with bottles of water, before Stevens returns to the sewer. Throughout the video, sequences of <b>Stevens</b> <b>and</b> a group of backup dancers performing in the sewer are shown.|$|E

5|$|Blamey {{recommended}} Burston for a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in September 1945, {{along with}} Frank Berryman, James Cannan, John Northcott, Jack <b>Stevens</b> <b>and</b> George Wootten. The recommendation {{was turned down}} by the Labor government as it was not Labor Party policy to award knighthoods at this time. Following {{the election of the}} coalition government in the 1949 election, Blamey wrote to the new Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, again requesting honours for his generals. This time he was successful, and Burston was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (military division) in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Brodie {{believed}} that previous historians had unduly vilified <b>Stevens,</b> <b>and</b> she enjoyed {{the prospect of}} rebuilding a reputation rather than, as in her Joseph Smith biography, tearing one down. Stevens {{as a champion of}} black people was a timely interest as the Civil Rights Movement increased in intensity. Research materials were available at Yale University, where Bernard Brodie was employed. Fawn Brodie wondered how Stevens had been affected psychologically by his physical deformity, a club foot.|$|E

5|$|Following {{a tumultuous}} {{pre-season}} {{in which they}} went {{through a period of}} administration and were saved by late investment, Manor Marussia arrived in Melbourne with a car that had passed its mandatory crash tests, but had completed no testing. Formula Renault 3.5 Series drivers Will <b>Stevens</b> <b>and</b> Roberto Merhi were announced as their drivers, with Merhi signed on a one-race deal. However, the team did not participate in any practice sessions and subsequently failed to set a qualifying time, leaving the field at eighteen cars for the race.|$|E
5|$|In 1758, Johnson {{began to}} write a weekly series, The Idler, which ran from 15 April 1758 to 5 April 1760, {{as a way to}} avoid {{finishing}} his Shakespeare. This series was shorter and lacked many features of The Rambler. Unlike his independent publication of The Rambler, The Idler was published in a weekly news journal The Universal Chronicle, a publication supported by John Payne, John Newbery, Robert <b>Stevens</b> <b>and</b> William Faden.|$|E
5|$|In New York Times Co. v. Tasini (1997), {{freelance}} journalists {{sued the}} New York Times Company for copyright infringement for the New York Times inclusion in an electronic archival database (LexisNexis) {{of the work}} of freelancers it had published. Sotomayor ruled that the publisher had the right to license the freelancers' work. This decision was reversed on appeal, and the Supreme Court upheld the reversal; two dissenters (John Paul <b>Stevens</b> <b>and</b> Stephen Breyer) took Sotomayor's position.|$|E

5|$|On July 17, 2012, the Devils {{announced}} Stevens {{would return}} to the team as an assistant coach. After two seasons of failing to make the playoffs, Stevens stepped down as assistant coach in September 2014. His role as the assistant coach for defenseman was filled by another former Devil, Tommy Albelin. However, only three months later Stevens returned to the Devils along with former assistant coach Adam Oates, relieving Peter DeBoer of his coaching duties. In a unique move, both <b>Stevens</b> <b>and</b> Oates were named as co-head coaches with Stevens focusing on defenseman and Oates on forwards.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 2012, the U.S. {{diplomatic}} mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, {{resulting in the}} deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher <b>Stevens</b> <b>and</b> three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S. On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.|$|E
5|$|Reinforcing Presley's {{image as}} a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various Hollywood stars and starlets, from Natalie Wood in the 1950s to Connie <b>Stevens</b> <b>and</b> Ann-Margret in the 1960s to Candice Bergen and Cybill Shepherd in the 1970s. June Juanico of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for {{encouraging}} him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind. Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, {{and most of these}} relationships were insubstantial.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the second}} time the Supreme Court had granted certiorari to the Oneida's land claim. Over a decade earlier, in Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (1974), the Supreme Court had allowed the same suit to proceed by {{unanimously}} holding that there was federal subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the claim. Since then, Justices William O. Douglas and Potter Stewart had departed, replaced by John Paul <b>Stevens</b> <b>and</b> Sandra Day O'Connor.|$|E
5|$|Two matches aired {{during the}} thirty-minute pre-show. The first {{encounter}} pitted The Naturals (Chase <b>Stevens</b> <b>and</b> Andy Douglas) against Johnny B. Badd and Sonny Siaki. The Naturals won the bout after Stevens bashed Siaki {{over the head}} with steel folding chair and then pinned him. A standard wrestling match between Chris Candido and Cassidy Riley followed. Candido was victorious in the bout by pinning Riley after a diving headbutt off the top of a padded turnbuckle.|$|E
5|$|When Patterson {{returned}} to the San Francisco area, he feuded with Stevens, who had become a face.
