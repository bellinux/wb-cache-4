5|$|With {{no serious}} {{challenge}} from Republican opponents, Nixon won an overwhelming {{victory in the}} Republican primary, with his cross-filing rivals, Boddy, Douglas, and Desmond, dividing a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vote but running well ahead of the two fringe candidates.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of the coupling reaction, a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solid support-bound 5'-OH groups (0.1 to 1%) remains unreacted and needs to be permanently blocked from further chain elongation to prevent the formation of oligonucleotides with an internal base deletion commonly referred to as (n-1) shortmers. The unreacted 5'-hydroxy groups are, to a large extent, acetylated by the capping mixture.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, non-Hispanic {{whites were}} {{involved}} in 72.3 percent <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> births. Minnesota's growing minority groups, however, still form a <b>smaller</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population than in {{the nation as a}} whole.|$|R
5|$|Caterpillars {{are also}} {{affected}} by a range of bacterial, viral and fungal diseases, and only a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> butterfly eggs laid ever reach adulthood. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis {{has been used in}} sprays to reduce damage to crops by the caterpillars of the large white butterfly, and the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has proved effective for the same purpose.|$|E
5|$|Holland {{suggests}} {{that under the}} reign of Arab Emperor Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, even though only a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants of the Empire was Muslim, Mecca was intentionally yet erroneously portrayed as Muhammad's home and the birthplace of Islam {{in order to provide}} the religion with Arabian origins. Holland argues that in doing so, the faith was dissociated from the Jewish or Christian heritage that would have been self evident at a location in the Negev.|$|E
5|$|The hearing {{began on}} 21 January 1997, under the {{supervision}} of a three-judge panel led by Mikaela Warsito. After both sides were unable to come to an amicable settlement, a several-month-long trial began, in which Udin's family, Bernas reporters, and the police testified. On 7 April 1997, Wuryanto was convicted of destroying evidence for taking the blood, which Marisyem's lawyers speculated was used to frame Sumaji. Only a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damages were awarded, after the court ruled that testimony from Udin's family– whom they saw as having a conflict of interest in the outcome of the case– was ineligible.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{majority}} of those advocating a name change are Democrats, {{there is no indication that}} the issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans are such a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, polls show a definite political difference in the opinion of the general public, with only 58% of Democrats opposing a name change versus 89% of Republicans. Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action. There have also been non-binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in New Jersey and passed in Minneapolis, New York State and California.|$|E
5|$|Many Northern coastal towns {{were built}} on trade, and retain large sea ports. The Humber ports of Grimsby and Immingham (counted {{as a single}} port for {{statistical}} purposes) are the busiest in the UK in terms of tonnage, serving 59.1 million tons as of 2015, and Teesport and the Port of Liverpool are also among the country's largest – in total, 35% of British freight was shipped through Northern ports. Roll-on/roll-off ferries offer passenger and freight connections to the Isle of Man and Ireland along the west coast, while east coast ports connect to Belgium and the Netherlands, although Northern ports handle only a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK's vehicle traffic.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{cast the}} actors by {{approaching}} customers {{at a local}} gas station whenever he saw somebody that looked like they fit one of the parts. He hired high school students as crew members who helped load and move equipment. For the creature itself, he limited the sightings to shadowy figures because he felt the film would be more frightening if the creature was left to the viewer's imagination. Pierce sang the theme song featured in the film. Once the film was completed, he put the reel {{into the trunk of}} his car and drove to Los Angeles seeking post-production services. He met Jamie Mendoza-Nava, who owned a small post-production company and agreed to work on the film for limited up-front pay and a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film's box-office receipts. Pierce could not find a major studio willing to distribute it, so he rented a local movie theater in Texarkana for one week to screen the film. He cleaned the property himself to prepare for the debut.|$|E
50|$|Though {{comprising}} very <b>small</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hispanic and Latino American population, {{and even}} <b>smaller</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total U.S. population, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preceding racial subgroups make up large minorities among the respective racial groups, overall. For instance, Hispanics and Latinos who are American Indian or Alaska Native compose 15% of all American Indians and Alaska Natives (per the ACS estimates). Meanwhile, the 120,000 Hispanics and Latinos who are of Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander race compose 22% of this entire race nationally (per the Population Estimates). Again, {{nearly a third}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall 'Two or more race' population is Hispanic or Latino (ACS).|$|R
50|$|Tokelau has two {{official}} languages: Tokelauan and English. Over 90% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population speaks Tokelauan, {{and just}} under 60% speak English.

5|$|The {{final vote}} {{has come under}} much {{criticism}} because of the relatively <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 9000-strong IAU membership who participated. Besides {{the fact that most}} members do not attend the General Assemblies, this lack was also due to the timing of the vote: the final vote was taken {{on the last day of}} the 10-day event, after many participants had left or were preparing to leave. The claim is that only 424 astronomers were present for the vote, which is less than 5% of the entire community of astronomers. However, sampling 400 representative members out of a population of 9,000 statistically yields a result with good accuracy (confidence interval better than 5%). There is also the issue of the many astronomers who were unable or who chose not to make the trip to Prague and, thus, cast no vote. Astronomer Marla Geha has clarified that not all members of the Union were needed to vote on the classification issue: only those whose work is directly related to planetary studies.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{important}} issue {{during the campaign}} {{was that of the}} languages in the country. The status of the Swedish and Russian languages was an hot-button issue. A growing number of people believe that the Swedish language should be abolished as the country's second official language, as only a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country use Swedish as their first language and {{that a large number of}} government officials do not use Swedish. A report by the Council of Europe stated that the Swedish language's status as Finland's second official language was in danger of being eroded in the longer term because of the officials' poor language skills and the lack of opportunities to study the language. However, the status of Russian was considered to be rising as several municipalities in eastern Finland sought to increase the role of the language at local schools. At the time, Swedish was spoken by 5.42% of the population as their mother tongue, with Russian spoken by 1.01% and the Sami languages spoken by 0.03%.|$|E

50|$|Note: because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{exceptionally}} small {{population of}} Waldron, estimates extrapolated from samples <b>of</b> <b>small</b> <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> residents are statistically unreliable.

50|$|Loren Thompson <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lexington Institute {{has noted}} that, as {{entitlement}} programs are largely {{exempt from the}} mandated cuts, sequestration would result in these programs assuming a larger <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> (reduced) budget, while spending on other programs such as defense would make up a <b>smaller</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> budget.|$|R
