5|$|A {{large number}} of {{chemical}} compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases. Despite <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> chemical composition, these molecules have some common features in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotics, bowlics and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a bowlic is not flat but like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object). This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotics and bowlics. Rod-shaped molecules have an elongated, anisotropic geometry which allows for preferential alignment along one spatial direction.|$|E

5|$|The Columbia Gorge AVA {{is found}} in the Columbia Gorge.

The region lies to the east of the summits of nearby Mount Hood and Mount Adams, situated in their rain shadows; thus, the region is significantly drier than the Willamette Valley. It also exhibits <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> elevation due to gorge geography, and strong winds common in the area also play a factor in the region's climate. This allows a wide variety of grapes to be grown in the Columbia Gorge.

5|$|The genus Phedina {{is thought}} to be an early {{offshoot}} from the main swallow lineage, although their striped plumage suggests a distant relationship with several streaked African Hirundo species. In the past it has sometimes been suggested that Brazza's martin should be moved to its own genus Phedinopsis due to the <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> vocalisations and nest type from its relative. The nearest relative of the Phedina martins is the banded martin, Riparia cincta, which appears not to be closely related to the other members of its current genus and resembles Brazza's martin in nesting habits and vocalisations. The current Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC)-recommended practice is to move the banded martin to its own genus as Neophedina cincta, rather than to merge it into Phedina, since the banded martin's larger size, different bill and nostril shape and non-colonial nesting are differences from the other Phedina species.|$|E

50|$|A 1999 {{study found}} {{for people in}} the F2, F3 and F4 classes in the discuss, elbow flexion and {{shoulder}} horizontal abduction are equally important variables in the speed at which they release the discuss. For F2, F3 and F4 discuss throwers, the discus tends to be below shoulder heightand the forearm level is generally above elbow height at the moment of release of the discuss. F2 and F4 discuss throwers have limited shoulder girdle range of motion. F2, F3 and F4 discus throwers have good sitting balance while throwing. F5, F6 and F7 discus throwers have greater anguler speed of the shoulder girdle during release of the discus than the lower number classes of F2, F3 and F4. F2 and F4 discus throwers have greater average angular forearm speed than F5, F6, F7 and F8 throwers. F2 and F4 speed is caused by use of the elbow flexsion to compensate for the shoulder flexsion advantage of F5, F6, F7 and F8 throwers. A study of javelin throwers in 2003 found that F2 throwers have angular speeds of the shoulder girdle less than that of other classes.
