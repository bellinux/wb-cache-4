40|$|Problem statement: This study {{investigated}} the issues of <b>trade</b> barriers to <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> in Malaysia. In recent years, there has been decreasing the <b>trade</b> barriers to <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> in Malaysia. Approach: <b>Trade</b> barriers to <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> are {{an important role in}} the forest economics sector and take a major player in Malaysias economic growth. There is a growing concern that <b>trade</b> barriers to <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> are creating both direct and indirect opportunities to environmental trade issues. Results: We analyzed the role of <b>trade</b> barriers to <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> and the barriers of <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> policy in Malaysia. Conclusion: We explained tariff removals of <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> in Malaysia. The purpose of this study is to highlight and clarify the impacts on <b>trade</b> barriers to <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> in Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|Illegal logging {{has been}} at the centre of policy debates about the current state and future {{prospects}} of Indonesia’s forestry sector. One of the prevailing views is that clandestine cross-border <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> is responsible for illegal logging in the country. This paper shows the core of the illegal logging problem lies not in timber smuggling in remote locations but in licensed forestry operations that engage in gross over-harvesting and violate shipping regulations. These actions, in turn, are necessitated by a vast supply-demand disparity in Indonesia’s wood-working sector. The current <b>timber</b> <b>trade</b> system in Indonesia that stresses administrative and document compliance is insuffi cient because it is easy to manipulate and its enforcement is lax. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a more stringent timber legality standard that would be simpler to enforce and easier to evaluate. However, this will only work if a serious effort is made to restructure (downsize) forest industries and develop <b>sustainable</b> industrial <b>timber</b> plantations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel spatial equilibrium model to analyse the leverage {{impact of the}} EU’s <b>Timber</b> Regulation on <b>sustainable</b> <b>timber</b> production. This leverage effect is an argument in favour of FLEGT but {{it has never been}} investigated thoroughly, or simultaneously for demand and supply. The leverage effect is measured in terms of the market share of <b>sustainable</b> <b>timber</b> in the total timber consumption and production of a region. Our research finds that FLEGT does not provide an incentive for <b>sustainable</b> <b>timber</b> production and consumption at global level. FLEGT creates a non-tariff trade barrier at the conventional timber markets of important producing regions (Europe and North America). This protectionist situation favours conventional timber which decreases the importance of <b>sustainable</b> <b>timber.</b> In addition, the protectionist situation decreases global welfare...|$|R
