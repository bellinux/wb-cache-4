5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of <b>soil</b> <b>aeration,</b> enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} {{new approach to}} restoring land is to inoculate soil with AM fungi when reintroducing vegetation in ecological restoration projects (phytoremediation). It has enabled host plants to establish themselves on degraded soil and improve soil quality and health. Soils' quality parameters were significantly improved long-term when a mixture of indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi species was introduced compared to noninoculated soil and soil inoculated with a single exotic species of AM fungi. The benefits were increased plant growth, increased phosphorus uptake and soil nitrogen content, higher soil organic matter content, and soil aggregation, attributed to higher legume nodulation {{in the presence of}} AMF, better water infiltration, and <b>soil</b> <b>aeration</b> due to soil aggregation.|$|E
25|$|Avocados can be {{propagated}} by seed, taking roughly four to {{six years}} to bear fruit, although in some cases seedlings can take 10 years to come into bearing. The offspring {{is unlikely to be}} identical to the parent cultivar in fruit quality. Prime quality varieties are therefore propagated by grafting to rootstocks that are propagated by seed (seedling rootstocks) or by layering (clonal rootstocks). After about a year of growing in a greenhouse, the young rootstocks are ready to be grafted. Terminal and lateral grafting is normally used. The scion cultivar grows for another 6–12 months before the tree is ready to be sold. Clonal rootstocks are selected for tolerance of specific soil and disease conditions, such as poor <b>soil</b> <b>aeration</b> or resistance to the soil-borne disease (root rot) caused by Phytophthora.|$|E

2500|$|Ploughing is {{not always}} {{regarded}} as essential nowadays, but the plough can improve soil by inverting it to improve <b>soil</b> <b>aeration</b> and drainage, release nutrients through weathering, and expose harmful pests to predators. [...] It is also an effective method of weed control. [...] Ploughing depth in Britain varies between 5–6inches in some limestone regions to up to 18inches in deep stoneless silt land. [...] Most British ploughs are designed to turn a furrow of up to about a foot deep, which is relatively shallow compared to some other countries, where furrows of up to 16inches are common. [...] Other machines used to prepare land include cultivators (to break up land too heavy for a normal plough), harrows (to level the surface of ploughed land), rolls or rollers (used for firming the soil), sprayers and dusters (used to spread herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and fertilisers).|$|E

50|$|Buckingham's first work on {{soil physics}} is on <b>soil</b> <b>aeration,</b> {{particularly}} {{the loss of}} carbon dioxide from the soil and its subsequent replacement by oxygen.
