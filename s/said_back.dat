2500|$|Although the March 2007 {{issue of}} Foreign Policy listed BJU {{as one of}} [...] "The World's Most Controversial Religious Sites" [...] because of its past {{influence}} on American politics, BJU has seen little political controversy since Stephen Jones became president. When asked by a Newsweek reporter if he wished to play a political role, Stephen Jones replied, [...] "It would not be my choice." [...] Further, {{when asked if he}} felt ideologically closer to his father's engagement with politics or to other evangelicals who have tried to avoid civic involvement, he answered, [...] "The gospel is for individuals. The main message we have is to individuals. We’re not here to save the culture." [...] In a 2005 Washington Post interview, Jones dodged political questions and even admitted that he was embarrassed by [...] "some of the more vitriolic comments" [...] made by his predecessors. [...] "I don't want to get specific," [...] he said, [...] "But there were things <b>said</b> <b>back</b> then that I wouldn't say today." [...] In October 2007 when Bob Jones III, as [...] "a private citizen," [...] endorsed Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination for president, Stephen Jones {{made it clear that he}} wished [...] "to stay out of politics" [...] and that neither he nor the university had endorsed anyone. Despite a hotly contested South Carolina primary, none of the candidates appeared on the platform of BJU's Founders' Memorial Amphitorium during the 2008 election cycle. In April 2008 Stephen Jones told a reporter, [...] "I don't think I have a political bone in my body." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the {{occupation}} {{and in the}} chaos that ensued after the Germans left, Schwarzbard lay low, survived a serious bout with typhus and worked securing facilities and supplies for the newly forming Soviet school system. He had himself tried to establish independent anarchist schools, but was {{willing to work with}} the Bolsheviks as they increasingly centralized the school system. Hearing news of countless pogroms, Schwarzbard tried to volunteer as a Red Guard Soldier. After many delays, he was finally accepted into an [...] "International Brigade" [...] in June, 1919 and begin his second revolutionary campaign. The next two months were perhaps the worst of his life. His unit suffered defeat to the combined forces of Petliura and Denikin who were uneasy allies at the time. Schwarzbard was in Kiev when both, Ukrainian and White Armies entered, his unit having since been wiped out and disbanded. It was in this period, July–August, 1919 that Schwarzbard witnessed first hand the ruins and human devastation left by pogrom violence—images that would haunt him {{for the rest of his}} life. He again managed to ride the rails back to Odessa, where he was betrayed by a fellow anarchist to the White forces in control of the city. Before they could catch him, he found out that as a French war veteran, he could catch a ship back to France. In late December, 1919 he boarded the Nicholas I [...] and sailed over Istanbul, Beirut and Port <b>Said</b> <b>back</b> to Marseilles. He was back in Paris by January 21, 1920.|$|E

6000|$|When Judge Trumbull, {{our other}} Senator in Congress, {{returned}} to Illinois {{in the month}} of August, he made a speech at Chicago, in which he made what may be called a charge against Judge Douglas, which I understand proved to be very offensive to him. The Judge was at that time out upon one of his speaking tours through the country, and when the news of it reached him, as I am informed, he denounced Judge Trumbull in rather harsh terms for having said what he did in regard to that matter. I was traveling at that time, and speaking at the same places with Judge Douglas on subsequent days, and when I heard of what Judge Trumbull had said of Douglas, and what Douglas had <b>said</b> <b>back</b> again, I felt that I was in a position where I could not remain entirely silent in regard to the matter. Consequently, upon two or three occasions I alluded to it, and alluded to it in no other wise than to say that in regard to the charge brought by Trumbull against Douglas, I personally knew nothing, and sought to say nothing about it; that I did personally know Judge Trumbull; that I believed him to be a man of veracity; that I believed him to be a man of capacity sufficient to know very well whether an assertion he was making, as a conclusion drawn from a set of facts, was true or false; and as a conclusion of my own from that, I stated it as my belief if Trumbull should ever be called upon, he would prove everything he had said. I said this upon two or three occasions. Upon a subsequent occasion, Judge Trumbull spoke again before an audience at Alton, and upon that occasion not only repeated his charge against Douglas, but arrayed the evidence he relied upon to substantiate it. This speech was published at length; and subsequently at Jacksonville Judge Douglas alluded to the matter. In the course of his speech, and near the close of it, he stated in regard to myself what I will now read: ...|$|E

60|$|He {{was glad}} that Mr. Morse was not there. It was {{difficult}} enough getting acquainted with her, and her mother, and her brother, Norman. Arthur he already knew somewhat. The father {{would have been too}} much for him, he felt sure. It seemed to him that he had never worked so hard in his life. The severest toil was child's play compared with this. Tiny nodules of moisture stood out on his forehead, and his shirt was wet with sweat from the exertion of doing so many unaccustomed things at once. He had to eat as he had never eaten before, to handle strange tools, to glance surreptitiously about and learn how to accomplish each new thing, to receive the flood of impressions that was pouring in upon him and being mentally annotated and classified; to be conscious of a yearning for her that perturbed him {{in the form of a}} dull, aching restlessness; to feel the prod of desire to win to the walk in life whereon she trod, and to have his mind ever and again straying off in speculation and vague plans of how to reach to her. Also, when his secret glance went across to Norman opposite him, or to any one else, to ascertain just what knife or fork was to be used in any particular occasion, that person's features were seized upon by his mind, which automatically strove to appraise them and to divine what they were--all in relation to her. Then he had to talk, to hear what was said to him and what was <b>said</b> <b>back</b> and forth, and to answer, when it was necessary, with a tongue prone to looseness of speech that required a constant curb. And to add confusion to confusion, there was the servant, an unceasing menace, that appeared noiselessly at his shoulder, a dire Sphinx that propounded puzzles and conundrums demanding instantaneous solution. He was oppressed throughout the meal by the thought of finger-bowls. Irrelevantly, insistently, scores of times, he wondered when they would come on and what they looked like. He had heard of such things, and now, sooner or later, somewhere in the next few minutes, he would see them, sit at table with exalted beings who used them--ay, and he would use them himself. And most important of all, far down and yet always at the surface of his thought, was the problem of how he should comport himself toward these persons. What should his attitude be? He wrestled continually and anxiously with the problem. There were cowardly suggestions that he should make believe, assume a part; and there were still more cowardly suggestions that warned him he would fail in such course, that his nature was not fitted to live up to it, and that he would make a fool of himself.|$|E
