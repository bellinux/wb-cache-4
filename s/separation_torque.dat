40|$|The {{synchronization}} and bundling {{process of}} bacterial flagella is investigated by mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations. Systems with {{two to six}} flagella are considered, which are anchored at one end, and are driven by a constant torque. A flagellum is modelled as a linear helical structure composed of mass points with their elastic shape maintained by bonds, bending, and torsional potentials. The characteristic times for synchronization and bundling are analyzed in terms of motor <b>torque,</b> <b>separation,</b> and number of flagella. We find that hydrodynamic interactions determine the bundling behavior. The synchronization time is smaller than the bundling time, but their ratio depends strongly on the initial separation. The bundling time decreases with increasing number of flagella at a fixed radius in a circular arrangement due to multi-helix hydrodynamics...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, some {{previously}} published experimental and theoretical studies of hot rolling are reviewed. A {{thorough understanding of}} the available roll design methods, and conditions of their application is extremely important {{in order to achieve}} the objective of producing high quality rolled products. Successful hot roll design is dominated by the calculations of some important parameters, which describe two-dimensional (2 D) or three-dimensional (3 D) deformation in the workpiece. These parameters, such as roll <b>separation</b> force, <b>torque,</b> elongation, spread and draft, are discussed in detail. The method or formula for the calculation of each parameter is different for each set of different application conditions. A thorough study of these methods in different application cases will lead to the optimised design of hot rolled products. Finite Element (EE) is an important method which has been employed in the study of hot rolling. Design theory, commercial software and application cases have been described. 2 -D and 3 -D Finite Element Methods (FEM) for hot rolling simulation have also been discussed within the work. The current techniques and the problems of using the Finite Element system in hot roll design have been presented briefly. Possible solutions to these problems have also been discussed and there need to be considered in order to successfully apply Finite Element theory in hot roll design. An important alternative approach for hot roll design has been introduced in this thesis. A Matrix-based roll design system has been developed. It includes a Matrix-based system for flat and section roll designs. The realisation of the Matrix-based system is discussed. All the methods and formulae considered previously can be integrated in the proposed roll design system. The approach emphasizes the need for teamwork. The design procedure allows both less experienced designers and senior designers to benefit from participation. It is suggested that high quality rolled products could be achieved from optimised designs produced using this systematised the approach compared to the ad-hoc use of existing techniques, formulae and methods...|$|R
