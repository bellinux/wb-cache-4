40|$|It {{is often}} {{desirable}} {{to know the}} loss occasioned by shrink age in handling and holding wool under varying conditions. With this end in view, {{as well as to}} make a comparison of different methods of storing wool, twenty-four fleeces, divided into four lots, were stored by three different methods and weighed periodically (generally monthly) for a year. Three lots of the wool were from high grade Shropshire <b>sheep,</b> <b>clipped</b> from between the 14 th and 18 th of April, 1892. One lot, consisting of five fleeces was weighed, fleeces separately, and packed in a dry clean box just large enough to contain the wool conveniently and a close fitting cover nailed on...|$|R
50|$|In 1905 {{approximately}} 32,000 sheep were shorn at Doorawarrah. By 1908 {{the flock}} size had increased to 36,368 and 558 bales of wool were produced from shearing. 42,459 <b>sheep</b> were <b>clipped</b> in 1910, yielding 768 bales. The area had three dry years from mid 1909 to early 1913, with the Gascoyne River {{not running for}} any of that time.|$|R
50|$|By 1926 over 31,000 <b>sheep</b> were <b>clipped</b> and in 1927 {{the station}} shore 32,000 {{producing}} over 900 bales of wool. In 1928 {{the station was}} owned still by the Aitken Brothers, who were originally from South Australia., the station also sold off 21,000 sheep from both Murgoo and the adjoining Mt. Narryer station which was also owned by the brothers.|$|R
50|$|Albert King was {{manager of}} the {{property}} and in 1928 a total of 10,500 <b>sheep</b> were <b>clipped</b> during shearing, producing 202 bales of wool. In 1928 about 12,000 sheep were shorn. The 1936 shearing produced 123 bales from a flock of 7,000 sheep {{after a couple of}} poor seasons. King retired as manager in 1946 and was replaced by Bob Knowles. By 1949 Geoff French was managing the station when he left to run another nearby property, Warrambo.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of vehicles on penetration and retention of lidocaine applied to sheep skin in vitro. Thoracic skin from two <b>sheep</b> was <b>clipped</b> of wool and stored at − 20 °C, until used. Skin samples were defrosted and mounted in Franz-type diffusion cells, {{and then one of}} the following formulations, each saturated with lidocaine, was added: sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) 0. 5 % in water, SLS 1 % in water, dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) 50 % in water (wt/wt), DMSO 100 %, isopropyl myristate 100 % (IPM), water alone, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DGME) 50 % in water (wt/wt) and DGME 100 %. The penetration of lidocaine in each skin sample was measured over 8 h. Significantly greater lidocaine skin concentrations and flux (JSS) were achieved with the nonaqueous vehicles, DMSO 100 % (P < 0. 00001 and P < 0. 01, respectively), followed by DGME 100 % and IPM (P < 0. 00001 and P < 0. 01, respectively). The lag time (tlag) for lidocaine penetration in the DMSO 100 % vehicle was significantly shorter (P < 0. 01) compared with all other vehicles except water. Improved transdermal penetration of lidocaine in the DMSO 100 % vehicle was likely due to skin barrier disruption, as determined by differences in pre- and post-treatment transepidermal water loss (TEWL). This study has shown that nonaqueous vehicles enhanced penetration of lidocaine in sheep skin {{to a greater extent than}} aqueous vehicles, which has implications for topically applied local anaesthesia in sheep...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{one of the}} world’s first large-scale {{experiments in}} biological control of a major vertebrate pest of agriculture, which was tried in New Zealand {{during the second half}} of the nineteenth century. Starting from the late 1860 s, pasture damage in Southland and Otago by European rabbits was causing serious reductions in productivity of <b>sheep</b> (wool <b>clip</b> and lambing percentages) associated with malnutrition of the breeding ewes, and a consequent decline in the value of pastoral land. In response, and despite repeated local and international warnings, ferrets, stoats and weasels (Mustela furo, M. erminea and M. nivalis) were liberated on the worst of the rabbit-infested pastures. They were perceived as the ‘natural enemies of the rabbit’ but (unlike foxes) too small to threaten lambs. Over the 50 years after 1870, upwards of 75, 000 ferrets, most imported from Australia or locally bred, were released in the South Island. Over the decade 1883 – 1892, at least 7838 stoats and weasels arrived from Britain. At least 25 shipments are known, with an average of only 10 % mortality per shipment. Of the 3585 animals listed by species, 73 % were weasels. The total cost of the ferret programme cannot now be estimated; that of stoats and weasels alone was at least £ 5441, probably twice that, or >$NZ 1 – 2 million in today’s money. Mustelids (and cats) killed many young rabbits, which was helpful because rates of change in rabbit populations are sensitive to variations in juvenile mortality, but in the most rabbit-prone semi-arid lands, mustelids could not remove enough rabbits to prevent the continuing damage to sheep pastures. The era of deliberate introductions of mustelids to control rabbits in New Zealand was short, expensive, and unsuccessful...|$|R

40|$|This study {{determines how}} levels of various trace metals in wool and the colour of the fibre {{change as a}} result of {{sunlight}} exposure and treatment with chelating compounds during wool growth. Twenty-four yearling Merino <b>sheep</b> were <b>clipped</b> on the shoulders and rumps and fitted with sheep coats modified with transparent patches. Patches over the shoulder wool (one per sheep) were either polyethylene (PE) that transmits ultraviolet light or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) that excludes ultraviolet light. The rump wool on each sheep was treated either with a copper chelator treatment (kojic acid or methyl gentisate in aqueous alcohol) or aqueous alcohol only. For 12 of the sheep the rumps were exposed to sunlight through PE patches while rump wool on the other sheep was covered by the sheep coat. Wool was harvested after 11 weeks’ growth with yellowness (Y-Z) and individual mineral contents measured using the same clean wool sample. Sunlight exposure through PE patches caused a mean increase in Y-Z to 9. 1 (shoulder) or 9. 5 – 10. 1 (rump) from a base level of 7. 1 – 7. 2 (shoulder) or 7. 0 – 7. 6 (rump) in wool protected by the sheep coat. In contrast, there was no significant change in Y-Z for the PVC patch (shoulder). Therefore, it appears that ultraviolet light damage caused the increased Y-Z. Most of the trace metals analysed increased in the shoulder wool exposed to sunlight but the paired differences for PVC were lower than PE. It appears that changes in fibre caused by sunlight exposure (especially ultraviolet light) facilitate adsorption of minerals from the environment, including the animal’s own suint. Application of the chelating compounds to the rump wool caused pronounced yellowing of the wool with Y-Z increase being most pronounced for kojic acid. Copper levels in the wool were reduced by kojic acid and methyl gentisate while calcium levels were increased by kojic acid and reduced by methyl gentisate. It is not clear from these findings whether minerals and copper in particular contribute to yellowing of wool. However, the different effects of sunlight and chelation on mineral contents in wool shown may well relate to alternative mechanisms of discoloration (i. e. photoyellowing versus bacterial) ...|$|R

Last year, on a certain evil day, the jousts were held at Chester, and thither my son went, as did I and my lady wife. I wot it was a proud time for us, for he unhorsed each knight that he tilted against. At last he ran a course with a certain great knight, Sir Walter of Lancaster, yet, though my son was so youthful, he kept his seat, albeit both spears were shivered to the heft; but it happened that a splinter of my boy's lance ran through the visor of Sir Walter's helmet and pierced through his eye into his brain, so that he died ere his esquire could unlace his helm. Now, Robin, Sir Walter had great friends at court, therefore his kinsmen stirred up things against my son so that, to save him from prison, I had to pay a ransom of six hundred pounds in gold. All might have gone well even yet, only that, by ins and outs and crookedness of laws, I was shorn like a <b>sheep</b> that is <b>clipped</b> to the quick. So it came that I had to pawn my lands to the Priory of Emmet for more money, and a hard bargain they drove with me in my hour of need. Yet I would have thee understand I grieve so for my lands only because of my dear lady wife." ...|$|R

Results 178 farmers and 54 sheep specialists participated. Participants could identify even mildly lame sheep but made a separate decision on whether to catch them. This decision was dependent on the severity of lameness and the number of sheep lame in a group. Those who said they would catch the first lame sheep in a group {{were significantly more likely to}} catch mildly lame sheep (farmer-reported median prevalence of lameness 5 % (IQR: 2 %– 6 %)). In contrast, farmers who waited for several sheep to be lame indicated that they would only catch more severely lame sheep (farmer reported median flock lameness 11 % (IQR: 9 %– 15 %)). Approximately 15 % of farmers did not catch individual lame sheep (farmer reported median flock lameness 15 % (IQR: 10 %– 15 %)). The flock prevalence of lameness increased as time to treatment increased and time to treatment was positively correlated with only catching more severely lame sheep. Conclusion If movie-clips are similar to the flock situation, farmers and specialists can recognise even mildly lame sheep but vary in their management from prompt treatment of the first lame sheep in a group to no individual sheep treatments. The former practices would be appropriate to minimise transmission of footrot, a common, infectious cause of lameness and so reduce its incidence. The analysis also suggests that farmers estimate lameness prevalence relatively accurately because farmers who treated the first mildly lame sheep in a group also reported the lowest prevalence of lameness in their flock. </p...|$|R
