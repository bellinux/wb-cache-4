40|$|Background and aim: Post-delivery {{surgical}} {{repair of}} the perineal region is frequently associated {{with pain and}} discomfort. The surgical technique {{may play a role}} in the intensity of pain and the wound healing process. This study was conducted to compare the influence of applying <b>standard</b> continuous versus <b>interrupted</b> suturing on pain sensation and the frequency of wound infection following episiotomy. Methods: In a randomized double blind clinical trial, 148 healthy women with normal vaginal delivery and sustained episiotomy were studied in the Hajar hospital, Shahrekord. In one group, perineal muscles, fascia and skin tissues were repaired with continuous non-locking sutures. <b>Standard</b> <b>interrupted</b> locking suturing was applied for the next group. Pain feeling and wound infection were evaluated at 2 hours, 10 th and 40 th days of post-delivery by Visual Analog Scale and the signs of discoloration of skin, edema, purulent discharge, and wound dehiscence, respectively. Data were analyzed by t-student, X 2 and Mann-Whitney tests. Results: Pain intensity, the amount of consumed suturing material and the allocated time were less in the cases with continuous suturing (P< 0. 001). The mean of pain intensity was 2. 66 ± 2. 5 versus 3. 84 ± 2. 56 and 0. 53 ± 1. 63 versus 0. 6 ± 1. 04 at 10 th and 40 th days after delivery in continuous and <b>standard</b> <b>interrupted</b> suturing groups, respectively (P< 0. 05). Signs of wound infection were observed only in 4 cases (12. 5 %), all of which belonged to the <b>standard</b> <b>interrupted</b> suturing group. There was a statistically significant inter-group difference in terms of the frequency of observed wound infection (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: The pain intensity and the chance of wound infection is less in continuous suturing of episiotomy wounds. It also is a safer and more cost-effective method as it lowers the bedding time of the mother and needs for surgical material...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} non-integer switching frequency ratios in digitally controlled DC-DC converters. In particular the execution of multiple control algorithms using a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) for this application is analyzed. The variation in delay from when the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) samples the output voltage to when the duty cycle is updated is identified as a critical factor to be considered when implementing the digital control system. Fixing the delay to its maximum value is found to produce reasonable performance using a conventional DSP. A modification of the DSP’s interrupt control logic is proposed here that minimizes the delay and thereby yields improved performance compared with that given by a <b>standard</b> <b>interrupt</b> controller. Applying this technique to a multi-rail power supply system provides the designer with the flexibility to choose arbitrary switching frequencies for individual converters, thereby allowing optimization of the efficiency and performance of the individual converters.

40|$|ALASKA The remarkably high {{frequency}} of strong surface winds {{in the region}} of Big Delta, Alaska, is studied with respect to its cause, characteristics, and local effects. During the winter, the winds are predominantly east-southeast and, unlike glacier or valley winds, are caused by a topographically induced convergence of the flow of air down the Tanana Valley which occurs at times of southeast gradient winds aloft. Strong south winds are also experienced the year round. A noteworthy characteristic of the east-southeast winds is their persistence; an extreme case is described in which gusts in excess of 40 m. p. h. endured for 7 % days (January 20 - 28, 1952). Another characteristic of these winds is the marked diurnal variation in the frequency of their commencement, by which a strong control by atmospheric tides is inferred. An important effect of the winds is to <b>interrupt</b> <b>periods</b> of very low temperature, but sometimes to create severe “wind chill. ” The paper concludes with a brief account of the forecast problem. 1...|$|R
