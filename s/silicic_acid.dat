Significantly, relative to the organic cell walls produced by other groups, silica frustules require less energy to synthesize (approximately 8%), potentially a major saving on the overall cell energy budget and possibly an explanation for higher growth rates in diatoms.|$|E

30|$|The {{first model}} {{assumes that the}} ball-lightning-like {{luminous}} balls described in [9] are clouds of nanobatteries. P-type doped silicon evaporated by arc discharge is condensed {{in the form of}} aerosol submicron or nanoparticles of amorphous silicon with boron trioxide microaddings. Thus, a condensation cloud of burning hot nanoparticles of amorphous silicon is a cloud of potential silicon core reductants for aerosol nanobatteries. At 29 °C room temperature and a relative humidity of 70 % mentioned in [9], i.e., under conditions of very high absolute humidity of ambient air and consequently under conditions of extremely high vapour pressure of the water in immediate proximity to high-temperature ball-lightning-like objects, the oxidation of the aerosol nanoparticles of amorphous silicon will result in the formation of electrolyte layers of <b>silicic</b> <b>acids</b> (by reaction SiO 2 with water vapour) on their surface, instead of the expected SiO 2 dielectric surface layers. As is well known [12], at high temperatures silica scale layers are readily converted in the presence of water or water vapour to form <b>silicic</b> <b>acids.</b> Although these electrolyte silicon species are volatile at such temperatures, their ablation is compensated for by the persistent formation of new <b>silicic</b> <b>acids</b> layers {{on the surface of the}} silicon aerosol particles under conditions of high air moisture, i.e., in this case the processes of thermal ablation and water-mediated growth of such <b>silicic</b> <b>acids</b> layers are in dynamic equilibrium.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work three topics are {{outlined}} which are connected via biomineralisation. The {{investigation of the}} mechanical response of brachiopod shell material, the macroscopic calcite crystal growth, and the microscopic calcite crystal growth are discussed. Brachiopod shells have been investigated with nanoindentation and scanning electron microscopy to determine the material properties {{and the effects of}} the microstructure on the material properties. Brachiopod shells are highly optimised fibre composite materials. The material properties are adapted to the local material demands. The calcitic brachiopod Megerlia truncata exhibits a hard primary layer and a softer secondary layer with a tendency to higher hardness at the inner shell margin. At the hinge region the hardness is considerably higher and reflects the possibly high abrasive wear. The phosphatic brachiopod shells of Lingula anatina and Discradisca stella have laminated architecture with alternating hard and soft layers. They are harder in the center and have softer, more flexible regions at the margins. The macroscopic crystal growth of calcite was performed in gels. The obtained crystals were investigated with scanning electron microscopy. With inert pore solutions the { 104 } rhombohedron is the dominating habit. Succinic acid and aspartic acid inhibit the acute steps of the calcite { 104 } surface. In combination with Mg^ 2 + and Sr^ 2 + one side divergant forms are obtained. Pore solutions containing <b>silicic</b> <b>acids</b> produce catastrophic nucleation. Crystal aggregates from calcite, aragonite, and vaterite develop. The aggregates have morphological similarities with calcites from travertines. Mg^ 2 + and Sr^ 2 + counteract the effect of <b>silicic</b> <b>acids.</b> The microscopic crystal growth of the calcite { 104 } surface was investigated with the atomic force microscope in the presence of <b>silicic</b> <b>acids.</b> The two dimensional nucleation is enhanced. The form of the hillocks change from the additive free rhomb to lenses with increasing <b>silicic</b> <b>acids</b> concentrations. The step velocities increase from 0 ppm to 20 ppm <b>silicic</b> <b>acids</b> and decrease after 20 ppm. Therefore <b>silicic</b> <b>acids</b> possess a promoter and a inhibitor effect on calcite crystal growth. The inhibitory effect can be fitted by a Langmuir isotherm. Both effects can be fitted together with a polynom of rank three. For supersaturation β = 30 the step velocities are constant. This means that the process follows the step pinning model...|$|R
25|$|In the {{presence}} of heavy metals, calcium silicate reacts in a different manner than limestone. As limestone raises the pH of the bulk solution, and if heavy metals are present, precipitation of the metal hydroxides (with extremely low solubilities) is normally accelerated and the potential of armoring of limestone particles increases significantly. In the calcium silicate aggregate, as <b>silicic</b> <b>acid</b> species are absorbed onto the metal surface, the development of silica layers (mono- and bi-layers) lead {{to the formation of}} colloidal complexes with neutral or negative surface charges. These negatively charged colloids create an electrostatic repulsion with each other (as well as with the negatively charged calcium silicate granules) and the sequestered metal colloids are stabilized and remain in a dispersed state - effectively interrupting metal precipitation and reducing vulnerability of the material to armoring.|$|E
25|$|Diatom {{cells are}} {{contained}} within a unique silica cell wall {{known as a}} frustule made up of two valves called thecae, that typically overlap one another. The biogenic silica composing the cell wall is synthesised intracellularly by the polymerisation of <b>silicic</b> <b>acid</b> monomers. This material is then extruded to the cell exterior and added to the wall. In most species, when a diatom divides to produce two daughter cells, each cell keeps {{one of the two}} halves and grows a smaller half within it. As a result, after each division cycle, the average size of diatom cells in the population gets smaller. Once such cells reach a certain minimum size, rather than simply divide, they reverse this decline by forming an auxospore. This expands in size to give rise to a much larger cell, which then returns to size-diminishing divisions. Auxospore production is almost always linked to meiosis and sexual reproduction.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of silicon}} by diatoms is {{believed}} by many researchers {{to be the}} key to their ecological success. In a now classic study, Egge and Aksnes (1992) found that diatom dominance of mesocosm communities was directly related to the availability of <b>silicic</b> <b>acid</b> — when concentrations were greater than 2 µmol m−3, they found that diatoms typically represented more than 70% of the phytoplankton community. Raven (1983) noted that, relative to organic cell walls, silica frustules require less energy to synthesize (approximately 8% of a comparable organic wall), potentially a significant saving on the overall cell energy budget. Other researchers have suggested that the biogenic silica in diatom cell walls acts as an effective pH buffering agent, facilitating the conversion of bicarbonate to dissolved CO2 (which is more readily assimilated). Notwithstanding the possible advantages conferred by silicon, diatoms typically have higher growth rates than other algae of a corresponding size.|$|E

[...] Consequently, between mixing events, primary production (and the resulting processes that leads to sinking particulate material) constantly acts to consume nutrients in the mixed layer, and in many regions this leads to nutrient exhaustion and decreased mixed layer production in the summer (even in the presence of abundant light).

Interfacial free energies for celestite have been calculated for increasing silicon concentrations from measurements of induction times for homogeneous nucleation. The slight increase in the interfacial free energies confirms that dissolved silicon is an inhibitor of celestite nucleation. In addition, dissolved silicon has striking morphological effects. Celestite grown in the presence of silicon typically shows rounded and peanut-like morphologies formed by numerous disoriented crystals. The anomalous celestite morphologies and the increase in both induction times and interfacial free energies reveal a complex interaction between <b>silicic</b> <b>acids</b> and celestite surfaces. In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to study in detail the effect of dissolved silicon on the growth of celestite (001) faces. AFM observations show that the presence of silicon increases the growth velocity of a first monolayer on the celestite (001) face. However, once such a first monolayer is formed, no further multilayer growth is observed. Height and friction AFM images show clear differences in contrast between the first monolayer and the celestite (001) substrate, revealing differences in composition and/or structure. High-resolution AFM images of the first monolayer show patterns consistent with the celestite (001) surface lattice, indicating that a limited amount of silicon can be incorporated into the celestite structure.

Relative crystallinity and TiO 2 crystal size in the silica–titania particles increase with the silica content until SiO 2 /TiO 2 molar ratio of 0. 9, but at higher molar ratios they start to decrease. The single-source precursor containing peroxo titanic (PTA) and <b>silicic</b> <b>acids</b> has been proved {{to be responsible for}} high crystallinity of TiO 2 encapsulated into amorphous silica.

This sample, according to 29 Si NMR, also shows the high content of hydroxylated silica Q 3 and Q 2 groups, and it is the most photocatalytically active in UV-assisted decomposition of methylene blue among the tested materials. It has been determined that the increase in the amount of the condensed Q 4 silica in the mixed oxides leads to the decrease in photocatalytic performance of the material, despite its better crystallinity. High crystallinity, low degree of incorporation of Ti atoms in SiO 2 in the mixed oxide and adsorption of methylene blue in the vicinity of photoactive sites on the hydroxylated silica have been considered as the main factors determining the high degradation degree of methylene blue in the presence of silica–titania.

A single H-kanemite sample proved to be H(_ 2) Si(_ 2) O(_ 5), but two types of H-octosilicate and H-magadiite sample were prepared. These differed in the presence of interlayer water. Several CP experiments were used to investigate the relationship between (^ 29) Si and (^ 23) Na nuclei and protons in the silicates. Cross-polarisation mechanisms tended to involve magnetisation transfer from the H-bonded protons only. Their determination was possible with a consideration of the extent of spin-diffusion or chemical exchange over the time-scale of the relevant experiments. Finally, new model structures for kanemite and the interlayer space in kanemite, octosilicate, magadiite and kenyaite have been suggested, while previously- proposed silicate layers have been reconsidered...|$|R
40|$|Silicon is an {{essential}} element in human nutrition, with the symptoms of a silicon-deficient diet being abnormal bone development (Carlisle, 1972). Similarly, animals and bone forming osteoblast-like cells in vitro show an increase in bone growth when supplemented with the soluble, bioavailable form of silicon, orthosilicic acid [Si(OH 4) ] (Carlisle, 1988). Certain bioactive glass compositions can form a strong chemical bond with bone, doing so by dissolving to form a solution that includes orthosilicic acid which re-polymerises to form a hydrated silica gel layer that adsorbs growth factors, supports cell growth and acts a nucleation bed for bone mineral (Hench, 1980). Bioactive glass degradation products alone have {{also been shown to}} significantly enhance the activity of osteoblasts in vitro (Xynos et al, 2001). Pure, crystalline silicon is not soluble in water or body fluids, but when electrochemically etched with hydrofluoric acid, nanoscale silicon hydride-lined pores are formed through the material which render it soluble in aqueous solutions, yielding orthosilicic acid (Canham, 1996). Porous silicon has therefore been proposed as a novel orthopaedic biomaterial, acting in a similar way to bioactive glasses. In addition, the long, narrow pores can be filled with pharmaceuticals, creating a dissolvable drug delivery material with release kinetics that are easily controllable by adjusting the pore morphology and drug loading density (Anglin et al, 2008). This research aims to evaluate porous silicon (pSi) as a therapeutic biomaterial for bone tissue engineering applications {{in the form of a}} composite with the biodegradable polymer, polycaprolactone (PCL). pSi microparticles were incorporated into a polycaprolactone matrix and the composites characterised in terms of the ability to generate orthosilicic acids under various conditions. It was found that the composites released <b>silicic</b> <b>acids</b> at a rate proportional to the loading proportion of pSi, with 8 % composites (20 mg pSi in 230 mg PCL) eluting ~ 400 ng. ml- 1 Si per day. At this composition, pSi increased the amount of calcium phosphate formed on the composite in a simulated body fluid and this had the morphology and molar ratio of biological apatite (Ca:P ≈ 1. 5). The addition of 8 % pSi to polymers enhanced the electroconductivity of hydrogels by two orders of magnitude and did not significantly affect mechanical strength. The release profiles of small molecules such as gentamicin and large hydrophobic proteins such as alkaline phosphatase were enhanced by pre-loading sample drugs into pSi rather than directly loading drugs into PCL. Crucially, the molecules retained their activity following release. Other proteins such as bovine serum albumin were adsorbed onto the surface silica gel layer, suggesting a method for localising growth factors onto biomaterial surfaces. Osteoblasts responded well to 8 % pSi-PCL composites, producing significantly more collagen and glycosaminoglycans in vitro. Collagen in the extracellular matrix (ECM) was also significantly more highly crosslinked as determined by the pyridinium content of ECM lysates and was more mineralised than the ECM on PCL alone. The breakdown products of pSi also significantly enhanced the osteoblastic phenotype of cells in vitro. This research demonstrates that porous silicon can be added to polymer-based materials to enhance their effectiveness as biomaterials for orthopaedic tissue engineering.
