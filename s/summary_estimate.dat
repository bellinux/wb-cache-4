50|$|A {{range of}} {{organizations}} {{are working to}} coordinate the production of systematic reviews. Systematic reviews aim to bridge the research-policy divide by assessing the range of existing evidence on a particular topic, and presenting the information in an accessible format. Like rigorous Impact Evaluations, they are developed from a study Protocol which sets out a priori the criteria for study inclusion, search and methods of synthesis. Systematic reviews involve five key steps: determination of interventions, populations, outcomes and study designs to be included; searches to identify published and unpublished literature, and application of study inclusion criteria (relating to interventions, populations, outcomes and study design), {{as set out in}} study Protocol; coding of information from studies; presentation of quantitative estimates on intervention effectiveness using forest plots and, where interventions are determined as appropriately homogeneous, calculation of a pooled <b>summary</b> <b>estimate</b> using meta-analysis; finally, systematic reviews should be updated periodically as new evidence emerges. Systematic reviews may also involve the synthesis of qualitative information, for example relating to the barriers to, or facilitators of, intervention effectiveness.|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesOur {{objective}} was to estimate {{the magnitude of the}} relative risk (RR) for cardiovascular disease associated with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) from published prospective observational studies. BackgroundHyperglycemia is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, the magnitude of the RR for cardiovascular disease associated with IFG and IGT is unclear. MethodsWe searched PubMed from 1997 through 2008 for relevant publications and performed a meta-analysis. ResultsIn 18 publications with information about IFG (110 to 125 mg/dl) (IFG 110), estimates of RR ranged from 0. 65 to 2. 50. The fixed-effects <b>summary</b> <b>estimate</b> of RR was 1. 20 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 12 to 1. 28). In 8 publications with information about IFG (100 to 125 mg/dl) (IFG 100), estimates of RR ranged from 0. 87 to 1. 40. The fixed-effects <b>summary</b> <b>estimate</b> of RR was 1. 18 (95 % CI: 1. 09 to 1. 28). In 8 publications with information about IGT, estimates of RR ranged from 0. 83 to 1. 34. The fixed-effects <b>summary</b> <b>estimate</b> of RR was 1. 20 (95 % CI: 1. 07 to 1. 34). Five studies combined IFG and IGT, yielding a fixed-effects <b>summary</b> <b>estimate</b> of RR of 1. 10 (95 % CI: 0. 99 to 1. 23). No significant difference between the summary estimates for men and women were detected (IFG 110 : men: 1. 17 [95 % CI: 1. 05 to 1. 31], women: 1. 30 [95 % CI: 1. 10 to 1. 54]; IFG 100 : men: 1. 23 [95 % CI: 1. 06 to 1. 42], women: 1. 16 [95 % CI: 0. 99 to 1. 36]).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{carry out}} a {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of chemonucleolysis {{in the treatment of}} lumbar disc herniation. METHODS: Clinical trials were selected from 3 electronic databases (The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, and EMBASE). Data were analyzed with the software STATA, using the meta command. RESULTS: Twenty-two clinical trials were eligible. For chemonucleolysis versus placebo, the summary risk ratio estimate for pain relief as outcome was 1. 51 (95 % CI: 1. 27 - 1. 80). The <b>summary</b> <b>estimate</b> was 1. 07 (95 % CI: 0. 95 - 1. 20) for the comparison between chymopapain and collagenase. Regarding chemonucleolysis with chymopapain versus surgery, the fixed-effect <b>summary</b> <b>estimate</b> of effect for pain relief was 0. 93 (95 % CI: 0. 88 - 0. 98) with surgery as the reference group. In this case, heterogeneity was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Chemonucleolysis with chymopapain was superior to placebo and was as effective as collagenase in the treatment of lumbar disc prolapse. Results for studies comparing chemonucleolysis with surgery were heterogeneous, making it difficult to interpret the summary measure of effect...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveMeta-analysis of {{predictive}} {{values is}} usually discouraged because {{these values are}} directly affected by disease prevalence, but sensitivity and specificity sometimes show substantial heterogeneity as well. We propose a bivariate random-effects logitnormal model for the meta-analysis of the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of diagnostic tests. Study Design and SettingTwenty-three meta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy were reanalyzed. With separate models, we calculated <b>summary</b> <b>estimates</b> of the PPV and NPV and <b>summary</b> <b>estimates</b> of sensitivity and specificity. We compared these <b>summary</b> <b>estimates,</b> the goodness of fit of the two models, {{and the amount of}} heterogeneity of both approaches. ResultsThere were no substantial differences in the goodness of fit or amount of heterogeneity between both models. The median absolute difference between the projected PPV and NPV from the <b>summary</b> <b>estimates</b> of sensitivity and specificity and the <b>summary</b> <b>estimates</b> of PPV and NPV was 1 % point (interquartile range, 0 – 2 % points). ConclusionA model for the meta-analysis of predictive values fitted the data from a range of systematic reviews equally well as meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity. The choice for either model could be guided by considerations of the design used in the primary studies and sources of heterogeneity...|$|R

We included 48 meta-analyses from 35 MEDLINE-indexed systematic reviews published between September 2011 and January 2012 (743 diagnostic accuracy studies; 344, 015 participants). Within each meta-analysis, we ranked studies by publication date. We applied random-effects cumulative meta-analysis to follow how <b>summary</b> <b>estimates</b> of sensitivity and specificity evolved over time. Time trends were assessed by fitting a weighted linear regression model of the <b>summary</b> accuracy <b>estimate</b> against rank of publication. The median of the 48 slopes was - 0. 02 (- 0. 08 to 0. 03) for sensitivity and - 0. 01 (- 0. 03 to 0. 03) for specificity. Twelve of 96 (12. 5 %) time trends in sensitivity or specificity were statistically significant.

40|$|The {{natural history}} of {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) among patients after renal transplantation (RT) remains incompletely defined.

We used the random effects model of Der-Simonian and Laird to generate a <b>summary</b> <b>estimate</b> of the relative risk (RR) for mortality and graft loss with HCV seropositivity across the published studies. We identified eight clinical trials (6365 unique patients); six (75 %) were cohort studies and two (2 / 8 = 25 %) controlled trials, respectively. Pooling of study results demonstrated that presence of anti-HCV antibody was an independent and significant risk factor for death and graft failure after RT; the <b>summary</b> <b>estimate</b> for RR was 1. 79 (95 % CI, 1. 57 – 2. 03; homogeneity test, p = 0. 0427) and 1. 56 (95 % CI, 1. 35 – 1. 80; homogeneity test, p = 0. 0192), respectively. As a cause of death, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver cirrhosis were significantly more frequent among anti-HCV positive than anti-HCV negative RT patients.

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{the accuracy of}} heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) as a new and early cardiac biomarker in the early diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The introduction of early and safe biomarkers could lead to (a) a large reduction in unnecessary hospital referrals of patients suspected of, but not, having AMI and (b) an earlier start of treatment in patients with AMI. Design Diagnostic meta-analysis. Setting Hospital and pre-hospital. Patients Consecutive patients suspected of having AMI. Main outcome measures A <b>summary</b> <b>estimate</b> for sensitivity and specificity was calculated using the bivariate random-effects approach, and covariate {{analysis was used to}} examine sources of heterogeneity between studies. Results A systematic search yielded 16 studies (3709 patients, prevalence of AMI 13 - 74 %, male gender 49 - 84 %, median age 64 - 76 years). The <b>summary</b> <b>estimate</b> was 84 % (95 % CI 76 % to 90 %) for sensitivity and 84 % (95 % CI 76 % to 89 %) for specificity.

The association between HCV and GN {{has been supported}} by previous research but {{little is known about}} the relationship between HCV and kidney disease. Design, setting, participants, & measurements A systematic review of the published medical literature was conducted to determine if HCV is associated with increased likelihood of kidney disease in the general population. A random-effects model was used to generate a <b>summary</b> <b>estimate</b> of the relative risk for kidney disease, defined as an estimated GFR, 60 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2 or proteinuria, with HCV across the published studies.

40|$|It {{is widely}} held that random-effects <b>summary</b> effect <b>estimates</b> are more {{conservative}} than fixed-effects summaries in epidemiologic meta-analysis. This view {{is based on the}} fact that random-effects <b>summaries</b> have higher <b>estimated</b> variances and, consequently, wider confidence intervals than fixed-effects summaries when there is evidence of appreciable heterogeneity among the results from the individual studies. In such instances, however, the random-effects point estimates are not invariably closer to the null value nor are their p values invariably larger than those of fixed-effects summaries. Thus, random-effects summaries are not predictably conservative according to either of these two connotations of the term. The authors give an example from a meta-analysis of water chlorination and cancer in which the random-effects summaries are less conservative in both of these alternative senses and possibly more biased than the fixed-effects summaries. The discussion of when to use random effects and when to use fixed effects in computing <b>summary</b> <b>estimates</b> should be replaced by a discussion of whether <b>summary</b> <b>estimates</b> should be computed at all when the studies are not methodologically comparable, when their results are discernibly heterogeneous, or when there is evidence of publication bias.

40|$|Background: Time-series {{studies have}} shown {{short-term}} temporal associations between low levels of ambient particulate air pollution and adverse health effects. It is not known whether or to what extent this literature is affected by publication bias. Methods: We obtained effect estimates from time-series studies published up to January 2002. These were summarized and examined for funnel plot asymmetry. We compared <b>summary</b> <b>estimates</b> between single-city and prospective multicity studies. Using 1 multicity study, we examined the sensitivity of <b>summary</b> <b>estimates</b> to alternative lag selection policies. Results: We found evidence for publication bias among single-city studies of daily mortality, hospital admissions for chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), and incidence of cough symptom, but not for studies of lung function. Statistical correction for this bias reduced <b>summary</b> relative risk <b>estimates</b> for a 10 [mu]g/m 3 increment of particulate matter less than 10 [mu]m aerodynamic diameter (PM 10) as follows: daily mortality from 1. 006 to 1. 005 and admissions for COPD from 1. 013 to 1. 011; and odds ratio for cough from 1. 025 to 1. 015.

The aim of this meta-analysis is to review and summarize the pre-existing evidence {{on the effect of}} shift work or long working hours on the risk of PTB.

The <b>summary</b> <b>estimate</b> OR for performing shift work during pregnancy and the risk of PTB were 1. 04 (95 % CI 0. 90 - 1. 20).
