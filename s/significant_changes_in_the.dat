5|$|As {{with many}} of his novels, Balzac {{analyzes}} the influence of history and social status in La Cousine Bette. The book takes places between 1838 and 1846, when the reign of Louis-Philippe reflected and directed <b>significant</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> social structure. Balzac was a legitimist favoring the House of Bourbon, and idolized Napoleon Bonaparte as a paragon of effective absolutist power. Balzac felt that French society under the House of Orléans lacked strong leadership, and was fragmented by the demands of parliament. He also believed that Catholicism provided guidance for the nation, and that its absence heralded moral decay.|$|E

5|$|Facing <b>significant</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2006–07 season, Näslund's points total {{continued}} to decrease. He began the season by scoring his 300thgoal as a Canuck during the team's home-opener against the San Jose Sharks on 14 October 2006. The goal tied Canucks teammate Trevor Linden for the franchise lead in all-time goals. He soon surpassed Linden with his 301stgoal against the Edmonton Oilers on 17 October. Near the midway {{point of the}} season, however, Näslund went through a 17-game stretch without a goal. He completed the season with 60points, his lowest output since 1997–98. Teammate Daniel Sedin had 84points, marking {{the first time in}} eight seasons that Näslund did not lead the team in scoring. In the 2007post-season, Näslund contributed five points before the team was eliminated by the Anaheim Ducks in the Conference Semifinals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of its breed surveys and monitoring, the Conservancy has found <b>significant</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> populations of several swine breeds. The Berkshire breed has {{increased}} significantly in number, partially due to international demand for its meat, while other breeds have shown significant decreases, most likely due to increasing consolidation of the pork industry to large producers who use only a few specialized pork strains. Breeds such as the Chester White and Poland China have seen population numbers reduced by over 25 percent between 1998 and 2003, while the Hampshire and Yorkshire breeds have decreased by more than 30 percent in the same time.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{faith in}} Rwanda is Roman Catholicism, {{but there have}} been <b>significant</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nation's {{religious}} demographics since the genocide, with many conversions to Protestantism, especially its Evangelical wing, and, to a lesser degree, Islam. According to the 2012 census, Roman Catholics represented 43.7% of the population, Protestants (excluding Seventh-day Adventists) 37.7%, Seventh-day Adventists 11.8%, and Muslims 2.0%; 0.2% claimed no religious beliefs and 1.3% did not state a religion. Traditional religion, despite officially being followed by only 0.1% of the population, retains an influence. Many Rwandans view the Christian God as synonymous with the traditional Rwandan God Imana.|$|E

5|$|When Victoria became queen in 1837, Lehzen {{served as}} a sort of {{unofficial}} private secretary, enjoying apartments adjacent to Victoria's. The Queen's marriage to Prince Albert in 1840 led to <b>significant</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> royal household. Albert and Lehzen detested each other, and after an illness of the Princess Royal in 1841, Lehzen was quietly dismissed. Her close relationship with the Queen came to an end, although the two continued to write letters to each other. Lehzen spent her last years in Hanover on a generous pension, dying in 1870. Historian K. D. Reynolds writes that Lehzen was a major influence on Victoria's character, in particular giving her the strength of will to survive her troubled childhood and life as a young queen.|$|E
5|$|The {{story and}} cut scene {{animations}} were created in-house. The plot was originally written by Fox, {{who had also}} written most of the Sly Cooper stories, and reviewed by Fleming. As they continued to develop the game, they rewrote pieces of the story to reflect changes in the game, {{making sure that the}} story remained enjoyable. As the game became more complex, they brought in Bill Harms, a published comic book author, who had previously written for Supreme Commander and other video games. Harms assisted with the story and in-game dialog in addition to marketing materials. Fleming noted that {{the second half of the}} story underwent <b>significant</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last nine months of development; for example, when voice actor Caleb Moody voiced the lines for Zeke, he ad libbed additional lines that the team found to be enjoyable, and they reworked the story to incorporate them. The cut scenes were created in a similar format to the comics that the game was influenced by, and used to further extend the atmosphere of the superhero motif. The cut scenes were created by taking 2D art created in Corel Painter and Adobe Photoshop and placing them into artificial 3D stages built in Adobe After Effects to create a pseudo-3D effect that allowed them to play with camera placement and effects, and addition of organic elements such as dust clouds and ink spots.|$|E
