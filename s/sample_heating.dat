Precipitation from Homogeneous Solution: In {{order to}} make Q minimum we can, in some situations, {{generate}} the precipitating agent in the precipitation medium rather than adding it. For example, in order to precipitate iron as the hydroxide, we dissolve urea in the <b>sample.</b> <b>Heating</b> of the solution generates hydroxide ions from the hydrolysis of urea. Hydroxide ions are generated at all points in solution and thus there are no sites of concentration. We can also adjust the rate of urea hydrolysis and thus control the hydroxide generation rate.

The magnetic interaction is highly specific to the used superparamagnetic microbeads. The magnetic field does practically not affect the sample. Optical tweezers have the problem that the laser beam may also interact with other particles of the biological sample due to contrasts in the refractive index.

50|$|Spark or arc atomic {{emission}} spectroscopy {{is used for the}} analysis of metallic elements in solid samples. For non-conductive materials, the sample is ground with graphite powder to make it conductive. In traditional arc spectroscopy methods, a sample of the solid was commonly ground up and destroyed during analysis. An electric arc or spark is passed through the <b>sample,</b> <b>heating</b> it to a high temperature to excite the atoms within it. The excited analyte atoms emit light at characteristic wavelengths that can be dispersed with a monochromator and detected. In the past, the spark or arc conditions were typically not well controlled, the analysis for the elements in the sample were qualitative. However, modern spark sources with controlled discharges can be considered quantitative. Both qualitative and quantitative spark analysis are widely used for production quality control in foundry and metal casting facilities.|$|E
50|$|Sample {{handling}} in Raman spectroscopy offers considerable {{advantages over}} FTIR spectroscopy in that glass {{can be used}} for windows, lenses, and other optical components. A further advantage is that whereas water absorbs strongly in the infrared region, which limits the pathlengths that can be used and masking large region of the spectrum, the intensity of Raman scattering from water is usually weak and direct absorption interferes only when near-infrared lasers (e.g., 1064 nm) are used. Therefore, water is an ideal solvent. However, since the laser is focused to a relatively small spot size, rapid heating of samples can occur. When resonance Raman spectra are recorded, however, <b>sample</b> <b>heating</b> and photo-bleaching can cause damage and a change to the Raman spectrum obtained. Furthermore, if the absorbance of the sample is high (> OD 2) over the wavelength range in which the Raman spectrum is recorded then inner-filter effects (reabsorption of the Raman scattering by the sample) can decrease signal intensity dramatically. Typically, the sample is placed into a tube, which can then be spun to decrease the sample’s exposure to the laser light, and reduce the effects of photodegradation. Gaseous, liquid, and solid samples can all be analyzed using RR spectroscopy.|$|E

40|$|Max phase Ti(3) AlC(2) composite, which {{generally}} requires high {{energy ball milling}} and reactions at higher temperature, has been synthesized at lower temperatures by Friction Stir Processing (FSP). To enable this TiO 2 +C mixture is dispersed into aluminium matrix by FSP. FSP is a high strain rate plastic deformation process used for microstructural refinement in which a rotating nonconsumable tool mixes the work piece material while moving forward. Six overlapping passes of FSP were done to disperse stoichiometric TiO 2 +C mixture in to Aluminium matrix. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy was done to confirm uniform distribution of particles. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used for phase identification. XRD of as -processed sample showed peaks of Al, TiO 2 and C indicating absence of reaction during FSP. Differential Scanning Calorimetric (DSC) analysis done on this processed sample showed exothermic peaks at 633 degrees C (below melting point of Al), 710 degrees C (above melting point) and 951 degrees C (above melting point). To evaluate the reactions at these temperatures, processed <b>samples</b> were <b>heated</b> to respective temperatures. For <b>samples</b> <b>heated</b> to 633 degrees C, Ti 3 AlC 2, Al 3 Ti, TiC, Al phases has been observed along with unreacted TiO 2 and C. For <b>samples</b> <b>heated</b> to 710 degrees C, peaks of Ti 3 AlC 2, Al 3 Ti, Al and C were observed. For <b>sample</b> <b>heated</b> to 951 degrees C, only Ti 3 AlC 2 and Al 2 O 3 phases were observed besides Aluminium (Fig. 1). Interestingly, TiC impurity normally associated with Ti 3 AlC 2 synthesis was absent for the <b>sample</b> <b>heated</b> to 951 degrees C. It is postulated that due to particle refinement during FSP, activation energy of the reaction is lowered. This lowering of activation energy also led to formation of Ti 3 AlC 2 and TiC phases even for <b>samples</b> <b>heated</b> to 633 degrees C. Based on the results a reaction path has been proposed.

5000|$|Sir Charles Parsons was {{the first}} to attack the problem of {{generating}} high pressure simultaneously with high temperature. [...] His pressure apparatus consisted of piston-cylinder devices that used internal electrical resistance heating. He used a solid pressure transmitting material, which also served as thermal and electrical insulation. His cylindrical chambers ranged in diameter from 1 to 15 cm. The maximum pressure at the temperature he reported was of the order of 15000 atm (corresponding to ~1.5 GPa) at 3000 °C.Loring L. Coes, Jr., of the Norton Co., {{was the first}} person to develop a piston-cylinder device with capabilities substantially beyond those of the Parsons device. He did not personally publish a description of this equipment until 1962. The key feature of this device is the use of a hot, molded alumina liner or cylinder. The apparatus is double ended, pressure being generated by pushing a tungsten carbide piston into each end of the alumina cylinder. Because the alumina cylinder is electrically insulating, heating is accomplished, very simply, by passing an electric current from one piston through a <b>sample</b> <b>heating</b> tube and out through the opposite piston. The apparatus was used at pressures as high as 45000 atm (corresponding to ~4.5 GPa) simultaneously with a temperature of 800 °C. Temperature was measured by means of a thermocouple located in a well. At these temperature and pressure conditions, only one run is obtained in this device, the pistons and the alumina cylinder both being expendable. Even at 30000 atm (corresponding to ~3.0 GPa) the alumina cylinder is only useful for a few runs, as is also the case for the tungsten carbide pistons. The expense of using such a device is great.Nowadays both the piston and the cylinder are constructed of cemented tungsten carbide and electrical insulation is provided in a different manner than in the device of Coes. In particular, the basis for the modern piston-cylinder apparatus is given by the design described by Boyd and England in 1960, which has been the first machine that allowed experiments under upper mantle conditions to be routinely carried out in a laboratory.|$|E

Lixiviation with 1 N and 5 N NaCl solutions were utilized to simulate the effect of sea water and of concentrated NaCl solutions in salt mines on the immobilization of Cr. Radiation damage on the solid containing the immobilized Cr was studied by g-irradiating with a 60 Co source at 1000 and 6000 kGy. The Cr-containing <b>samples</b> <b>heated</b> at 1200 ºC, whether irradiated or not, safely immobilized Cr in the hydrotalcite mainly {{in the form of}} MgCr 2 O 4 spinel.
