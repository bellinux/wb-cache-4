500|$|Other reviewers {{have criticized}} the {{character}} development. Shane Bettenhausen of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine found the game's cast [...] "a tad mundane" [...] compared to characters from previous installments. Moreover, they found both Vaan and Ashe uninteresting, making the story lack [...] "the emotional punch". They also criticized the voice acting as uneven and rife with mispronunciations. GameTrailers also criticized the characters, saying {{that many of the}} game's [...] "other characters" [...] are [...] "more interesting than the ones you’ll actually control", and that the [...] "characters’ motivations are thin to non-existent". RPGFan editor Stephen Harris, while praising the quality of most of the voice acting and especially Balthier's, criticized Fran's as [...] "monotone and subdued" [...] with an [...] "indecipherable accent". Cortney Stone of RPGamer found fault with the voice acting recording, describing it as [...] "substandard" [...] and said that [...] "it <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> a few of the actors were too close to the microphones or the equipment was faulty", though she called [...] "the voice acting itself quite good, with characters of different nations having distinctive accents." ...|$|E
500|$|Kitty Empire of The Observer {{also thought}} that it shares {{similarities}} with [...] "Fighter". She cited the Björk song {{of the same name}} as another influence, due to its [...] "emotional territory" [...] Robert Copsey for Digital Spy described the song as [...] "nothing we haven't heard from her before, but there's an urgency to it that suggests Christina needed {{to get it out of}} her system", while Matthew Horton of Virgin Media wrote that Aguilera <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she is declaring war. Michael Gallucci for PopCrush was critical of the song, writing that it sounds like a Cher disco song which features Aguilera [...] "overworking" [...] her vocal cords. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly found the song's message to be confusing and did not understand who exactly Aguilera is supposed to be rising up against on the song, writing [...] "She hollers 'And we're gonna rise up.../ For every time you wronged me/ Well, you're gonna face an army, army of me.' Which begs the question: Rise up against whom? Is the whole world really out to get her, or is this just an excuse to wear camouflage hot pants?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Army of Me" [...] {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Andrew Hampp for Billboard and Chris Younie for 4Music both though that [...] "Army of Me" [...] {{could have been}} a potential single, the latter of whom writing [...] "This track must be a future single." [...] Younie continued to write that the song [...] "captivates and excites right from the very start", has a [...] "euphoric" [...] energy and is the type of [...] "angry" [...] pop song that Kelly Clarkson [...] "would give her right arm for". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe described it as a [...] "Gloria Gaynor-meets-Depeche Mode dance of anger." [...] Mike Wass for Idolator wrote that although [...] "Army of Me" [...] is a [...] "quality" [...] song, it is an album filler. Writing that it <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{it would have been a}} good song to include on her previous studio album, Bionic, Wass thought that Aguilera was [...] "not exaggerating" [...] when she refers to it as [...] "Fighter 2.0". He concluded his review by saying that although her vocals are sparse, it is a [...] "quirky" [...] addition to Lotus. The A.V. Clubs Annie Zaleski described Aguilera as a [...] "playful" [...] and [...] "sassy techno diva" [...] on [...] "Army of Me".|$|E
60|$|The Brook {{had changed}} her note again. It <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she were mumbling {{something}} soft.|$|R
60|$|There was a <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the {{receiver}} {{had been taken}} from her fingers. Dredlinton himself spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just wait here," [...] he said, {{his voice}} <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> someone had seized {{him by the}} windpipe, [...] "and I'll fetch you {{something}} from the dispensary." ...|$|R
500|$|Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice {{believed}} that the song failed as an [...] "album opener", but sounds [...] "slightly better" [...] after one finished the whole record. Chicago Tribune journalist Greg Kot {{believed that}} unlike Madonna's 80s Catholic imagery, [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] does not venture into new territory with its sound. Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald found the song [...] "laughable", calling it a [...] "yawning Catholic-girl-in-heat". In another review of the album for BBC News, Levine called it [...] "charmless genero-banger". Alex Macpherson from Fact panned the track, saying that the [...] "rote, lifeless singing on [...] <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> a guide track was mistakenly kept on the finished song, and arguably marks the worst vocal performance Madonna has ever committed to record." [...] Robert Leedham from Drowned in Sound website felt that the song did not represent the album's sound, hence failed as a single to promote it. Jon Pareles from The New York Times called it [...] "shallow, effective club fodder", describing it as containing [...] "blippy stereo-hopping synthesizers and generic title". This view was shared by Emily Mackay of The Quietus, who felt that the song {{would have been better}} for another artist and was below Madonna's level.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{considered}} [...] "Subtle Invitation" [...] {{to be one}} of the album's strongest songs {{because of}} its [...] "well executed" [...] jazz influence. The song begins with the sounds of people dining, then introduces the strong bassline and drums. Towards the end of the song, Carey belts out the climax. Sarah Rodman from The Boston Herald described it as fascinating and wrote, [...] "it <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Carey is singing in falsetto while still in her chest voice." [...] "Clown" [...] drew strong media attention, and its lyrical content led critics to speculate that Carey aimed it at rapper Eminem, who had publicly announced that he had had a relationship with Carey. Rodman said [...] "Clown" [...] was [...] "languidly sinister", with lyrics such as, [...] "I should've left it at 'I like your music too'...You should never have intimated we were lovers / when you know very well we never even touched each other." [...] Critics compared [...] "I Only Wanted" [...] with [...] "My All"s instrumentation and structure of verse, chorus and guitar solo. According to Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine, Carey makes vague allusions to her ex-husband Tommy Mottola with the line, [...] "Wish I'd stayed beneath my veil". The song uses Latin-inspired guitar instrumentation and wind sounds as an additional backbone to the melody, and dripping water as its percussion.|$|E
500|$|Priya Elan for NME was {{critical}} of Lewis's execution of the song [...] "Hurt", writing that she <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the singer took [...] "too much Night Nurse the evening before." [...] Elan noted that the composition of [...] "Hurt" [...] {{was similar to that}} of Lewis's cover of [...] "Run", writing [...] "there's an awful lot of layered build up to the chorus before a full band and orchestra come in during the second verse." [...] However, Elan concluded her review saying that although she appears not to know the legacy of the song, Lewis sounds [...] "pretty". Katherine St. Asaph for PopDust described Lewis's interpretation of [...] "Hurt" [...] as being formulaic like a [...] "template", writing that it is something that American Idol and The X Factor winners and contestants seem do when covering a song. St. Asaph continued to explain her opinions with regard to Lewis and [...] "Hurt", writing [...] "For Leona, that's big notes in bigger arrangements, with a couple hushed sections for contrast." [...] She was also skeptical of Lewis's emotive abilities, writing [...] "Either she knows that quiet-to-loud arrangements and whispered vocals can simulate gravitas pretty well regardless of whether you’re thinking of pain or grocery lists, or she’s genuinely feeling something that comes out in her voice." ...|$|E
5000|$|Together {{they were}} {{described}} as [...] "so unbelievably tight that they <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they are one masterful musician, playing two guitars, with four arms and one almighty voice".|$|R
60|$|Mr. Parker was {{apparently}} dragged {{away from the}} telephone. I waited impatiently. He returned in a moment or two. His voice <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he were a little irritated.|$|R
5000|$|The Radio Times {{called the}} film [...] "sentimental hokum...The songs <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> they were knocked {{out on a}} slow {{afternoon}} on Denmark Street, London's very own Tin Pan Alley." ...|$|R
2500|$|Delson's {{style is}} {{sometimes}} criticized {{as being too}} simplistic, lacking complexity, and largely limited to non-solo, non-instrumental sections, particularly during the Hybrid Theory and Meteora eras. He has stated that he [...] "doesn't like to show off", and that he attempts to play his guitar so that it <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it were the keyboard or strings so as to seamlessly {{fit in with the}} band's hip-hop- and electronica-style compositions. [...] Delson has also stated that he likes to produce a gritty, [...] "sampled" [...] feel with his sound. [...] Although a self-described [...] "fervent opponent of guitar leads," [...] he started performing solos in the Minutes to Midnight era after his bandmates encouraged him to do so. Delson performs guitar solos on the tracks [...] "What I've Done," [...] "In Pieces" [...] and [...] "The Little Things Give You Away." [...] Delson also played many solos on Linkin Park's 6th studio album The Hunting Party.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the first}} music rehearsal, {{or rather the}} first time the music was played over to us by Sullivan at the piano we arrived at Dick Dauntless's [...] "Parlez vous" [...] song. [...] After playing it over Sullivan said [...] "That's your song, Lely." [...] Gilbert {{happened}} to be seated next to me, and I said quite innocently [...] "It <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> a hornpipe should follow." [...] Gilbert grunted. [...] Nothing more was said or thought [...] at least by me [...] about the matter. [...] A few days later at rehearsal Gilbert, without any preamble, said [...] "Lely, can you dance a hornpipe?" [...] I was rather taken aback, as I had quite forgotten having spoken about one. [...] So, trying to be funny I suppose, I said [...] "Well, Mr. Gilbert, as the man said when asked if he could play the fiddle, I've never tried so I don't know." [...] Gilbert answered quite seriously [...] "How soon can you know?" [...] and I said equally seriously [...] "To-morrow".|$|E

6000|$|... "A {{man with}} {{concussion}} {{of the brain}} doesn't cry out like that. Besides, {{did you hear the}} end of it? It <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> some one were choking him. Hush!" ...|$|R
60|$|Just {{then they}} heard Chimbolo's shout, which was {{instantly}} {{followed by a}} succession of female shrieks. These latter were repeated several times, and <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the fugitives were scattering.|$|R
6000|$|The Merchant {{followed}} {{along the}} line of his thoughts. [...] "And the inhabitants are large in proportion to their world?" [...] He <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the news struck him less favorably now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Grandfather," [...] {{said little}} Alice, looking fearfully into his face, [...] "your voice <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{you were going}} to tell us {{something}} awful!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do repeat that, Sydney," [...] Lady Caroom begged, {{laying down}} her novel for a moment. [...] "It really <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{it ought to}} mean something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{there were}} three or four men down there," [...] said the doctor. [...] "Don't you think it's rather rash to go in just now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was always}} a dark horse, Foliot: It 's always the dark horses that get let in {{for this kind of}} thing"; and there was a <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he licked his lips.|$|R
60|$|Her voice <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{something}} had offended her. Rising from {{inspection of the}} horse's leg, Shelton saw Antonia and Toddles standing by. They had come through a wicketgate leading from the fields.|$|R
6000|$|I heard a scrubby, raspy <b>sound,</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Pyecroft {{had chosen}} that hour to shave, and I smelled paint. [...] "Drop aft a bit, Alf; we'll put a stencil under the stern six-inch casements." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what I {{wanted to}} say, {{but it sounds}} {{different}} on your lips. It <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> you meant it yourself, and that you meant it because of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a nasty, hackneyed, false {{phrase that}} is--that of a marrying man! It <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> some {{men were in}} the habit of getting married {{three or four times a}} month." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, John," [...] {{said the}} prince, [...] "it <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> you were right. Ha! my grace D'Armagnac, {{it seems that}} our friends on this side will not grieve if our English champions lose the day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What!" [...] The dark man's voice sharpened. He <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he were cross-examining a {{reluctant}} witness. [...] "Then why aren't you there? What {{are you doing}} here? Did he give you a holiday?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Without a word, {{the woman}} {{held it out}} to him; but, as Gabriel grasped the handle, a voice, which <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the mouth of the speaker were close to his hand, slowly said: ...|$|R
60|$|Three yards he moved, and stopped. Loud shriek after shriek {{came from}} the window of Mademoiselle. Quickly he ran back. He heard a body thumping upon the floor and a <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> heels beat {{alternately}} upon it.|$|R
60|$|Bickley walked away, making <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he {{were going}} to be ill and looking so absurd in his indignation that I nearly laughed. The Lady Yva {{actually}} did laugh, and very musical was that laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Cowper," [...] he said, [...] "there {{are reasons}} why I {{find it very}} hard to deny you anything, but as regards those three beans, you will neither eat one nor even hold it in your hand. Sit down and I will tell you a story which <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it might have {{happened}} a thousand years ago. It happened within the last three months. Listen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lily," [...] he said, [...] "I've {{come for}} the last time. It <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I meant to {{threaten}} you; but you won't take it in that way. I think you will know what I mean. I have {{come for the}} last time--to ask you to be my wife." [...] She had got up to greet him when he entered, and they were both still standing. She did not answer him at once, but turning away from him walked towards the window. [...] "You knew why I was coming to-day, Lily?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Harold An Wolf! You had him on {{a string}} already!' The name came like a sword through her heart, but the bitter comment braced her to further caution. Her voice seemed to her to <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> far away: ...|$|R
50|$|This {{makes it}} <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the {{punishment}} {{was more of}} a prolonged ducking than anything intended to inflict serious injury or trauma. Indeed, a footnote in one source suggests that it may have evolved from the medieval punishment of ducking.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm terribly interested," [...] said Ruth. (But {{she made}} it <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> she really was.) [...] "I think it's so wonderful.... I want to go off {{tramping}} through the Berkshires. I'm so tired {{of going to the}} same old places." ...|$|R
