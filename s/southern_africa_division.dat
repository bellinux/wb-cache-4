40|$|A {{few studies}} have focused on the {{determinants}} of military expenditure in Africa in general and <b>southern</b> <b>Africa</b> in particular. Most of the studies are not exclusively on this region but cover developing countries in general, with a few countries from <b>southern</b> <b>Africa.</b> Those that have focused on <b>southern</b> <b>Africa</b> are longitudinal case studies rather than cross-sectional.

The findings of this study confirm the importance of both economic and strategic variables in the determination of the level of military expenditure in developing countries.
