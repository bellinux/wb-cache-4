40|$|In {{a modern}} {{enterprise}} network of any scale, dependencies between hosts, protocols and network services are surpris-ingly complex, typically undocumented, and rarely static. Even though network management and troubleshooting rely on this information, automated discovery and monitoring of these dependencies remains an unsolved problem. The ap-proach we describe {{in this paper}} attempts to close this gap by proactively inferring a network-wide map of these complex relationships using innovative machine learning techniques. Constellation takes a black-box approach to learn explicit models of time dependencies using {{little more than the}} tim-ings of packet transmission and reception. The parameters of these models are automatically fitted, enabling Constella-tion to be robust to a variety of real-world traffic behaviours. Statistical hypothesis testing on the models provides a guar-anteed confidence level for the accuracy of the result.

40|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} been carried out on dry {{granular}} materials such as quartz sand, glass microspheres and sugar with different grain size, rounding and sphericity. The measurements have been made with a <b>simple</b> shear <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> for different values of normal stress (~ 50 - 900 Pa). Shear stress has been plotted against normal stress {{in order to determine the}} cohesion and coefficient of internal friction for the investigated materials. Resulting values of cohesion and coefficient of internal friction are mainly dependent on rounding and sphericity, while grain size has a less significant influence. Further, the behaviour of the materials for very small normal stresses (~ 0 - 400 Pa) is more complex than previously assumed. The fracture envelopes for all materials investigated are convex-outward for this small range and converge towards a straight failure envelope with increasing normal stress. Finally, in extensional faulting experiments, there is no significant change in fault dip with increasing depth. Therefore, the non-linear behaviour for small normal stresses is best described as a dependence of the cohesion on the normal stress and not as a dependence of the coefficient of internal friction on the normal stress. Values for cohesion increase from ~ 0 Pa (± 15 Pa) at zero normal stress to 137 - 247 Pa (± 15 Pa) for normal stresses greater than ~ 250 - 400 Pa. The results show that well-rounded, spherical material is better suited to model brittle behaviour of rocks in crustal and lithospheric scale analogue models than less well-rounded material, since it has a smaller cohesion and a coefficient of internal friction, which is closer to values of natural rocks.
