He ran forward, and saw that a thin stream of water was coming down through the boards of the ceiling. The water was splashing on some of the stock, and unless it was speedily checked it would do a good bit of damage.|$|E
60|$|A {{few days}} ago one of the six-story {{clothing}} stores along here had the space inside its plate-glass <b>show-window</b> partition'd into a little corral, and litter'd deeply with rich clover and hay, (I could smell the odor outside,) on which reposed two magnificent fat sheep, full-sized but young--the handsomest creatures of the kind I ever saw. I stop's long and long, with the crowd, to view them--one lying down chewing the cud, and one standing up, looking out, with dense-fringed patient eyes. Their wool, of a clear tawny color, with streaks of glistening black--altogether a queer sight amidst that crowded promenade of dandies, dollars and dry-goods.|$|E

[...] "How would it do," [...] thought I to myself, [...] "to buy a picture at a moderate price and put it up at a raffle?

6000|$|Ye Art Shoppe, Prop. Mrs. Mary Ellen Wilks, Christian Science Library {{open daily}} free. A {{touching}} fumble at beauty. A one-room shanty of boards recently covered with rough stucco. A <b>show-window</b> delicately rich in error: vases starting out to imitate tree-trunks but running off into blobs of gilt--an aluminum ash-tray labeled [...] "Greetings from Gopher Prairie"--a Christian Science magazine--a stamped sofa-cushion portraying a large ribbon {{tied to a}} small poppy, the correct skeins of embroidery-silk lying on the pillow. Inside the shop, a glimpse of bad carbon prints of bad and famous pictures, shelves of phonograph records and camera films, wooden toys, {{and in the midst}} an anxious small woman sitting in a padded rocking chair.|$|E
6000|$|They {{decided that}} {{the front of the}} shop should be elaborately simple; perhaps the door should be painted black, with a small-paned sash and a heavy brass latch. On each side should be a small-paned <b>show-window,</b> with books laid inside on an {{inclined}} shelving; on the door should be a modest bronze plate, reading, [...] "The Critical Bookstore." [...] They rejected shop as an affectation, and they hooted the notion of [...] "Ye Critical Bookstore" [...] as altogether loathsome. The door and window would be in a rather belated taste, but the beautiful is never out of date, and black paint and small panes might be found rococo in their old-fashionedness now. There should be a fireplace, or perhaps a Franklin stove, {{at the rear of the}} room, with a high-shouldered, small-paned sash on each side letting in the light from the yard of the carpenter-shop. On the chimneypiece should be lettered, [...] "Look 'round all ye want to, or set down and rest ye." ...|$|E
6000|$|The shop {{which at}} last {{appeared}} to suit him best was one {{which he had}} passed and looked at several times before it struck him favorably. It was in a small brick house in a side street, but not far {{from one of the}} main business avenues of the city. The shop seemed devoted to articles of stationery and small notions of various kinds not easy to be classified. He had stopped to look at three penknives fastened to a card, which was propped up in the little <b>show-window,</b> supported on one side by a chess-board with [...] "History of Asia" [...] in gilt letters on the back, and on the other by a small violin labelled [...] "1 dollar." [...] And as he gazed past these articles into the interior of the shop, which was now lighted up, it gradually dawned upon him that it was something like his ideal of an attractive and interesting business place. At any rate, he would go in and look at it. He did not care for a violin, even at the low price marked on the one in the window, but a new pocket-knife might be useful. So he walked in and asked to look at pocket-knives.|$|E
50|$|Kārlis Padegs {{turned into}} a legend of Riga's artistic life. He was {{contemporary}} of the tempestuous Jānis Tīdemanis (Džonis) who spent his formative years in Belgium and the barefooted tramp Irbīte (pastel painter Voldemārs Irbe). Some Riga inhabitants will still recall Kārlis Padegs as a most extravagant personality- his Spanish hat, a red scarf, a long black coat, pig-skin gloves, a bamboo cane, patent leather shoes and a white gaiters with little black buttons. The artist may be better remembered than his exhibitions held in quite untraditional premises (at cafe, in the street, in dancing halls) or in the <b>show-windows</b> of L.Kreicberga's photo sallon that once even {{attracted the attention of}} the police.|$|R

6000|$|A sudden caprice impelled her, in {{the privacy}} of her bedroom that evening, to draw his {{portrait}} for Peter Erwin. The complacency of New York men was most amusing, she wrote, and the amount of slang they used would have been deemed vulgar in St. Louis. Nevertheless, she liked people to be sure of themselves, and there was something [...] "insolent" [...] about New York which appealed to her. Peter, when he read that letter, seemed to see Mr. Howard Spence in the flesh; or arrayed, rather, in the kind of cloth alluringly draped in the <b>show-windows</b> of fashionable tailors. For Honora, all unconsciously, wrote literature. Literature was invented before phonographs, and will endure after them. Peter could hear Mr. Spence talk, for a part of that gentleman's conversation--a characteristic part--was faithfully transcribed. And Peter detected a strain of admiration running even through the ridicule.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't," [...] I interrupted; but I at {{any rate}} saw Lady Beldonald later on--the day came when her kinswoman brought her, and then I saw how her life must have its centre in her own idea of her appearance. Nothing else about her mattered--one knew her all when one knew that. She's indeed in one particular, I think, sole of her kind--a person whom vanity has had the odd effect of keeping {{positively}} safe and sound. This passion is supposed surely, for the most part, to be a principle of perversion and of injury, leading astray those who listen to it and landing them sooner or later in this or that complication; but it has landed her ladyship nowhere whatever--it has kept her from the first moment of full consciousness, one feels, exactly in the same place. It has protected her from every danger, has made her absolutely proper and prim. If she's [...] "preserved," [...] as Mrs. Munden originally described her to me, it's her vanity that has beautifully done it--putting her {{years ago in a}} plate-glass case and closing up the receptacle against every breath of air. How shouldn't she be preserved when you might smash your knuckles on this transparency before you could crack it? And she is--oh amazingly! Preservation is scarce the word for the rare condition of her surface. She looks naturally new, as if she took out every night her large lovely varnished eyes and put them in water. The thing was to paint her, I perceived, in the glass case--a most tempting attaching feat; render to the full the shining interposing plate and the general <b>show-window</b> effect.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes. Thank you. Well, of course, {{in a town}} {{geographically}} American, {{the shops}} were all shut on Sunday, and we couldn't buy even an Easter egg on Easter Sunday. But one of the stores had the shade of its <b>show-window</b> up, and the children simply glued themselves to {{it in such a}} fascination that we could hardly unstick them. That window was full of all kinds of Easter things--I don't remember what all; but there were Easter eggs in every imaginable color and pattern, and besides these there were whole troops of toy rabbits. I had forgotten that the natural offspring of Easter eggs is rabbits; but I took a brace, and remembered the fact and announced it to the children. They immediately demanded an explanation, with all sorts of scientific particulars, which I gave them, as reckless of the truth as I thought my wife would suffer without contradicting me. I had to say that while Easter eggs mostly hatched rabbits, there were instances in which they hatched other things, as, for instance, handfuls of eagles and half-eagles and double-eagles, {{especially in the case of}} the golden eggs that the goose laid. They knew all about that goose; but I had to tell them what those unfamiliar pieces of American coinage were, and promise to give them one each when they grew up, if they were good. That only partially satisfied them, and they wanted to know specifically what other kinds of things Easter eggs would hatch if properly treated. Each one had a preference; the baby always preferred what the last one said; and she wanted an ostrich, the same as her big brother; he was seven then.|$|E

60|$|I {{have been}} hesitating {{for some time}} to speak--or if indeed to speak at all--of that lovely and critic-defying sex, whose bright eyes and voluble prattle have not been without effect in {{tempering}} the austerities of my peripatetic musing. I have been humbly thankful that I have been permitted to view their bright dresses and those charming bonnets which seem to have brought the birds and flowers of spring within the dreary limits of the town, and--I trust I shall not be deemed unkind in saying it--my pleasure was not lessened by the reflection that the display, to me at least, was inexpensive. I have walked in--and I fear occasionally on--the train of the loveliest of her sex who has preceded me. If I have sometimes wondered why two young ladies always began to talk vivaciously on the approach of any good-looking fellow; if I have wondered whether the minor-like qualities of all large <b>show-windows</b> at all influenced their curiosity regarding silks and calicoes; if I have ever entertained the same ungentlemanly thought concerning daguerreotype show-cases; if I have ever misinterpreted the eye-shot which has passed between two pretty women--more searching, exhaustive and sincere than any of our feeble ogles; if I have ever committed these or any other impertinences, it was only to retire beaten and discomfited, and to confess that masculine philosophy, while it soars beyond Sirius and the ring of Saturn, stops short at the steel periphery which encompasses the simplest school-girl.|$|R
6000|$|April 7, 1864.--Warmish forenoon, {{after the}} storm {{of the past few}} days. I see, passing up, in the broad space between the curbs, a big squad of a couple of hundred conscripts, {{surrounded}} by a strong cordon of arm'd guards, and others interspers'd between the ranks. The government has learn'd caution from its experiences; there are many hundreds of [...] "bounty jumpers," [...] and already, as I am told, eighty thousand deserters! Next (also passing up the Avenue,) a cavalry company, young, but evidently well drill'd and service-harden'd men. Mark the upright posture in their saddles, the bronz'd and bearded young faces, the easy swaying to the motions of the horses, and the carbines by their right knees; handsome and reckless, some eighty of them, riding with rapid gait, clattering along. Then the tinkling bells of passing cars, the many shops (some with large <b>show-windows,</b> some with swords, straps for the shoulders of different ranks, hat-cords with acorns, or other insignia,) the military patrol marching along, with the orderly or second-lieutenant stopping different ones to examine passes--the forms, the faces, all sorts crowded together, the worn and pale, the pleas'd, some {{on their way to the}} railroad depot going home, the cripples, the darkeys, the long trains of government wagons, or the sad strings of ambulances conveying wounded--the many officers' horses tied in front of the drinking or oyster saloons, or held by black men or boys, or orderlies.|$|R
60|$|Miss Kilburn {{saw them}} in the spring, when their {{usefulness}} was least apparent, {{and she did not}} know whether to praise the spirit of progress which showed itself in them as well as in other things at Hatboro'. She had come prepared to have misgivings, but she had promised herself to be just; she thought she could bear the old ugliness, if not the new. Some of the new things, however, were not so ugly; the young station-master was handsome in his railroad uniform, and pleasanter to the eye than the veteran baggage-master, incongruous in his stiff silk cap and his shirt sleeves and spectacles. The station itself, one of Richardson's, massive and low, with red-tiled, spreading veranda roofs, impressed her with its fitness, and strengthened her for her encounter with the business architecture of Hatboro', which was of the florid, ambitious New York type, prevalent with every American town {{in the early stages of}} its prosperity. The buildings were of pink brick, faced with granite, and supported in the first story by columns of painted iron; flat-roofed blocks looked down over the low-wooden structures of earlier Hatboro', and a large hotel had pushed back the old-time tavern, and planted itself flush upon the sidewalk. But the stores seemed very good, as she glanced at them from her carriage, and their <b>show-windows</b> were tastefully arranged; the apothecary's had an interior of glittering neatness unsurpassed by an Italian apothecary's; and the provision-man's, besides its symmetrical array of pendent sides and quarters indoors, had banks of fruit and vegetables without, and a large aquarium with a spraying fountain in its window.|$|R

It was temporarily moved to the Novosibirsk Opera and Ballet Theatre in Novosibirsk. On 17 May 1945 The Trinity was returned to the Tretyakov Gallery. In May 2007 The Trinity was is taken out for the Europe-Russia-Europe exhibition, but {{a piece of the}} board was dislocated and had to be fixed and reinforced. Since 1997 the icon is moved every Pentecost from Andrei Rublev's room to the Tretyakov Gallery's church. It is placed under a special <b>show-window</b> with perfect temperature and humidity conditions. The first President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin had an idea of handing the icon over back to the Church. However Valentin Yanin with an assistance of Yuri Melentyev, the Minister of Culture at that time, managed to meet with the President and made him change his mind. The matter concluded with a decree published in the Rossiyskaya Gazeta, The Trinity was declared a property of the Tretyakov Gallery forever.|$|E
6000|$|In this town, {{facing the}} sea, is a street lined with quaint houses painted in yellows and browns and greens, and under each house {{the kind of}} a shop that brings back to the middleaged delectable {{memories}} of extreme youth and nickels to spend. Up and down that street on a bright Saturday afternoon may be seen our Middle-Western jackies chumming with the British sailors and Tommies, or flirting with the Irish girls, or gazing through the little panes of the <b>show-windows,</b> whose enterprising proprietors have imported from the States a popular brand of chewing-gum to make us feel more at home. In one of these shops, where I went to choose a picture post-card, I caught sight of an artistic display of a delicacy I had thought long obsolete--the everlasting gum-drop. But when I produced a shilling the shopkeeper shook his head. [...] "Sure, every day the sailors are wanting to buy them of me, but it's for ornament I'm keeping them," [...] he said. [...] "There's no more to be had till the war will be over. Eight years they're here now, and you wouldn't get a tooth in them, sir!" [...] So I wandered out again, joined the admiral, and inspected the Bluejackets' Club by the water's edge. Nothing one sees, perhaps, is so eloquent of the change that has taken place in the life and fabric of our navy. If you are an enlisted man, here in this commodious group of buildings you can get a good shore meal and entertain your friends among the Allies, you may sleep in a real bed, instead of a hammock, you may play pool, or see a moving-picture show, or witness a vaudeville worthy of professionals, like that recently given in honour of the visit of the admiral of our Atlantic fleet. A band of thirty pieces furnished the music, and in the opinion of the jackies one feature alone was lacking to make the entertainment a complete success--the new drop-curtain had failed to arrive from London. I happened to be present when this curtain was first unrolled, and beheld spread out before me a most realistic presentation of [...] "little old New York," [...] seen from the North River, towering against blue American skies. And though I have never been overfond of New York, that curtain in that place gave me a sensation! ...|$|R
