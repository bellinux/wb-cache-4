5|$|As {{fish stocks}} dwindle {{in the upper}} ocean, deep-sea {{fisheries}} are increasingly being targeted for exploitation. Because deep sea fish are long-lived and slow growing, these deep-sea fisheries are not thought to be sustainable {{in the long term}} given current management practices. Changes in primary production in the photic zone are expected to alter the standing <b>stocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> food-limited aphotic zone.|$|E

It is surmounted by a brass dove and was made by William Parsons of London. Some of the branches were stolen in 1776, but soon recovered.|$|E
5|$|Radyr Weir {{was built}} in 1774 to divert water into a leat to the Melingriffith Tin Plate Works. The weir is the third {{obstacle}} to migratory salmon and sea trout — the others being Llandaff Weir and Blackweir, both of which also have fish passes. Since the early 1980s, the salmon and sea trout <b>stocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Taff have been recovering from nearly 200 years of industrial pollution and exploitation. In 1993 the National Rivers Authority monitored over 500 salmon and 700 sea trout returning to the river to spawn.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air activated sludge treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish <b>stocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E
5|$|Originally, three parties {{owned the}} <b>stocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stock company, Peab who owned 50% of the stocks, Malmö FF who owned 25%, and Erling Pålsson Teknik & Fastighets AB {{who owned the}} {{remaining}} 25%. Malmö FF early expressed their desire to buy the stocks of Peab and Erling Pålsson to reduce rent on the stadium and increase profits. On 27 April 2012, {{it was announced that}} Malmö FF were close to buying the full 25% of stocks owned by Erling Pålsson and 25% of the stocks owned by Peab, increasing their own share to 75% and leaving Peab with a 25% share. On 1 May 2012, Malmö Stad granted the bailment needed for Malmö FF to buy the stocks. The deal, worth 90 million kronor, was finalised on 13 June 2012. The long-term goal for Malmö FF is to buy the remaining 25% of the stocks to fully own Swedbank Stadion.|$|E

25|$|The North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) is an international, inter-governmental {{organization}} dedicated to the conservation of anadromous fish stocks in international waters of the North Pacific Ocean and its adjacent seas. It was established on 11 February 1992 by the Convention for the Conservation of Anadromous <b>Stocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Pacific Ocean and originally consisted of four member nations: Canada, Japan, Russian Federation, and United States of America. On 27 May 2003, the Republic of Korea acceded to the Convention bringing the current number of Commission members to five. The primary objective of the Commission {{is to provide a}} mechanism for international cooperation promoting the conservation of anadromous <b>stocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NPAFC Convention Area of the North Pacific Ocean.|$|E

With these funds, the Dismal Swamp Canal was widened and deepened, allowing for larger boats to ship their goods.|$|E

25|$|In open-access {{resources}} {{like fish}} <b>stocks,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{absence of a}} system like individual transferable quotas, the impossibility of excluding others provokes the fishermen who want to increase catch to do so effectively by taking someone else' share, intensifying competition. This tragedy of the commons provokes a capitalization process that leads them to increase their costs until they are equal to their revenue, dissipating their rent completely.|$|E
25|$|The North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) was {{established}} by the Convention for the Conservation of Anadromous <b>Stocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Pacific Ocean. On 11 February 1992, the Convention was signed by Canada, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the United States of America, and took effect on 16 February 1993. The Republic of Korea later acceded to the Convention on 27 May 2003. As indicated in the Convention, the main objective of the NPAFC is to promote the conservation of anadromous <b>stocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Pacific Ocean. The NPAFC provides a framework for international cooperation on the scientific research of anadromous species and enforcement of fisheries regulations in the Convention Area. The Convention prohibits directed catch of anadromous fish in the Convention Area, but allows for some fishing of these species for scientific purposes under national and joint research programs with prior approval of the NPAFC. The Convention also includes measures to reduce incidental catch of anadromous fish in other high seas fisheries and prohibits the retention of these species on board fishing vessels in the Convention Area.|$|E
25|$|Directed {{fishing for}} {{anadromous}} <b>stocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Convention Area is prohibited, unless {{for scientific purposes}} with prior approval from the NPAFC. Directed fisheries and stock assessment activities are conducted by each member nation within their territorial waters. Catch and Hatchery statistics from these activities are reported to NPAFC. Recently, the Commission has created electronic data files that combine catch and hatchery statistics with time-series data and these data files are available to the public.|$|E

25|$|Ethanol is {{produced}} {{both as a}} petrochemical, through the hydration of ethylene and, via biological processes, by fermenting sugars with yeast. Which process is more economical depends on prevailing prices of petroleum and grain feed <b>stocks.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1970s most industrial ethanol in the United States was made as a petrochemical, but in the 1980s the United States introduced subsidies for corn based ethanol and today it is almost all made from that source.|$|E
25|$|Several cod stocks {{collapsed}} in the 1990s (declined by >95% of maximum historical biomass) and have failed to recover even with the cessation of fishing. This absence of the apex predator {{has led to a}} trophic cascade in many areas. While the north west Atlantic cod stocks have not yet recovered fully from overfishing in the past, most <b>stocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East Atlantic are currently in good condition and well managed, such as those at North Norway and Svalbard.|$|E
25|$|During {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} conflict, the Rhodesian {{government}} resorted to biological warfare. Watercourses at several sites close to the Mozambique border were deliberately contaminated with cholera and the toxin Sodium Coumadin, an anti-coagulant commonly used as the active ingredient in rat poison. Food <b>stocks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area were contaminated with anthrax spores. These biological attacks had little impact on the fighting capability of ZANLA, but caused considerable distress to the local population. Over 10,000 people contracted anthrax in the period 1978 to 1980, of whom 200 died. The facts about this episode became known during the hearings of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission during the late 1990s.|$|E
