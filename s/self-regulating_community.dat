This was confirmed in a hearing during 1279 that concluded that the miners of the area were distinct from the local population, thus paying their dues to the English crown instead of to Scotland. As a result, the miners lived in their own <b>self-regulated</b> <b>communities</b> under English protection.|$|R

Furthermore, the instructor can also choose the focus of the visualization: individual learners, teams or communities. This functionality is achieved by applying a reduction transformation on graphs that include all students; learners of the same team are represented as one node, while filtering out intra-team collaborations. Furthermore, the nodes’ color can depict team or community affiliation; teams are predetermined {{from the beginning of the}} semester, while communities are non-formal and <b>self-regulated.</b> <b>Community</b> detection is computed using a Laplacian method (Lambiotte et al., 2008).|$|R
40|$|The professionalization of the US {{accounting}} profession {{during the}} fifteen {{years prior to}} the first CPA law in 1896 is explored through a description of the most significant professional organization of the period, the Institute of Accounts (IA). The IA followed the dominant US professionalizing model for scientific occupations. The organizational ideal of the community of the competent, first used by physical scientists and then by social scientists and engineers, was used by the IA as a means of identifying, cultivating and conferring professional competencies. The professional environment leading up to the passage of the first CPA law was dominated by this ideal of developing, within a <b>self-regulated</b> <b>community,</b> the science of accounts through essays, papers and debates among the most competent of the profession.

40|$|It is {{notoriously}} difficult {{to design and}} attach suitable legal rights to intangible cultural heritage (ICH), due to its nature as an evolving, living heritage. This article investigates the effects of government intervention relating to Scottish tartan in order to trace the relationship between formal proprietary rights, commodification, and cultural branding. The article proceeds in three steps: from (1) the historical context of the Jacobite rebellion and the subsequent Victorian assignment of the tartan to clans; to (2) the formation and function of the subsequent <b>self-regulating</b> <b>community</b> tartan registers; and (3) the 2009 governmental intervention {{with the establishment of}} a governmental tartan register, subsuming the community groups’ role in self-regulating tartan. While past ICH protection efforts have focused primarily on developing countries, the example of tartan raises wider concerns about the social and economic impact of the subtle erosion or, conversely, the ossification of living heritages. Finally, some alternatives are considered within the IP regime, such as sui generis protection, while highlighting the challenges of reconciling the domestic regulation of diverse ICH...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{framework}} for discovery of collaborative community structure in Wiki-based knowledge repositories based on raw-content generation analysis. We leverage topic modelling in order to capture agreement and opposition of contributors and analyze these multi-modal relations to map communities in the contributor base. The key steps of our approach include (i) modeling of pairwise variable-strength contributor interactions that can be both positive and negative, (ii) synthesis of a global network incorporating all pairwise interactions, and (iii) detection and analysis of community structure encoded in such networks. The global community discovery algorithm we propose outperforms existing alternatives in identifying coherent clusters according to objective optimality criteria. Analysis of the discovered community structure reveals coalitions of common-interest editors who back each other in promoting some topics and collectively oppose other coalitions or single authors. We couple contributor interactions with content evolution and reveal the global picture of opposing themes within the <b>self-regulated</b> <b>community</b> base for both controversial and featured articles in Wikipedia...|$|R
50|$|Privateering was {{a highly}} disciplined affair {{conducted}} {{under the command of}} the rais (captains) of the fleets. Several captains became heroes in Algerian lore for their bravery and skill. The captains of the corsairs banded together in a <b>self-regulating</b> taifa (<b>community)</b> to protect and further the corporate interests of their trade. The taifa came to be ethnically mixed, incorporating those captured Europeans who agreed to convert to Islam and supply information useful for future raids. The taifa also gained prestige and political influence because of its role in fighting the infidel and providing the merchants and rulers of Algiers with a major source of income. Algiers became the privateering city-state par excellence, especially between 1560 and 1620. And it was two privateer brothers who were instrumental in extending Ottoman influence in Algeria.|$|R
500|$|It is {{uncertain}} who {{spoke for the}} rebels at Mile End, and Wat Tyler {{may not have been}} present on this occasion, but they appear to have put forward their various demands to the King, including the surrender of the hated officials on their lists for execution; the abolition of serfdom and unfree tenure; [...] "that there should be no law within the realm save the law of Winchester", and a general amnesty for the rebels. It is unclear precisely what was meant by the law of Winchester, but it probably referred to the rebel ideal of <b>self-regulating</b> village <b>communities.</b> Richard issued charters announcing the abolition of serfdom, which immediately began to be disseminated around the country. He declined to hand over any of his officials, apparently instead promising that he would personally implement any justice that was required.|$|R

Current grid security mechanisms support individual users as members of well-defined virtual organizations. Recent research seeks to provide manageable grid security services for <b>self-regulating,</b> stable <b>communities.</b> Our prior work with component-based systems for grid computation demonstrated a need to support spontaneous, limited, short-lived collaborations which rely on shared or delegated fine grained access privileges. Our mechanisms enable the high-level management of such fine grained privileges based on PKIX attribute certificates and enforce resulting access policies through readily available POSIX operating system extensions. In combination, our mechanisms leverage other work in the grid computing and security communities, reduce administrative costs to resource providers, enable ad-hoc collaboration through incremental trust relationships and can be used to provide improved security service to long-lived communities. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Research into {{organised}} online protest typically {{focuses on}} how digital activism empowers social movements. But what if an online community is rebelling against its platform owners? This study seeks {{to identify the}} trajectory of internally focused revolutionary activity in <b>self-regulated</b> online <b>communities.</b> Based on an analysis of three cases (Reddit, 2015; Mozilla, 2014, and Skyrim, 2015) it identifies six stages of revolution: incident, reaction, mobilization, action, negotiation, {{and a return to}} ‘normality’ with a new power equilibrium. For each stage, key events, relations between the community and platform managers, {{and the ways in which}} power is enacted through online means, are identified. This preliminary model for online community revolution offers potential for further work that has diagnostic, predictive and ameliorative value. Relations with online communities are of significant value in an era in which many platform-related business models are reliant on voluntary contributions of selfregulating online communities...|$|R

40|$|Will Hanley's chapter, "When Did Egyptians Stop Being Ottomans? An Imperial Citizenship Case Study," is a nuanced {{study of}} the {{mutability}} of citizenship, particularly in contexts of questionable sovereignty. In this case, the context is the flexible, locally conditioned, and ephemeral nature of the imperial Ottoman presence in Egypt {{around the same time}} period as Elizabeth Dale's focus (in the next chapter), {{the end of the nineteenth}} century and start of the twentieth. Hanley demonstrates the persistence of the Egyptians' Ottoman status well into the twentieth century, evidence he argues has been neglected because the nature of Ottoman citizens'/subjects' membership in their state differs from European and American archetypes of citizenship. The triumph of a system of exclusive, universal, commensurate national citizenships is incomplete—Hanley argues that it cannot be completed, and that thinking of unitary citizenship as completable is misleading—and its advent is recent. Hanley contends that occluded variant systems of state affiliation, including that of turn-of-the-century Egyptian Ottomans, need to be recovered and compared, not least because citizenship in late Ottoman Egypt resembles developing forms of multilevel citizenship. This chapter shows, among other things, the fragility of censuses and government attempts to classify and categorize populations. It also lays out an example of a context in which citizenship is about jurisdiction rather than rights and in which taxation or exemption from taxation determines membership. Furthermore, the chapter illustrates again the importance to governments of residence and settlement: both the nomadic Bedouin and the foreign population were anomalous because they were mobile and exempt from the laws that governed other subjects. Hanley argues that the overwhelming focus of citizenship literature on political rights, especially democratic and electoral politics, deadens analysis of legal, social, civil, and other forms of citizenship. Ottoman-Egyptian citizenship was not democratic, and there can thus be no political consideration of it. When political rights are the measure, states in the Middle East must be judged dysfunctional and pathological, but it is possible to take a more positive view, seeing phenomena such as jurisdiction shopping, <b>self-regulating</b> <b>communities,</b> and differentiated rather than equal citizenship as illustrating how citizenship is actually experienced. This case also suggests parallels with indigenous peoples; with Roma and other nomads; and with legal "persons" such as corporations, which today claim exemptions from state laws, as discussed in Chapters 7, 10, and 11, as well as Chapter 6...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs a {{contribution}} to both rural theory and a geography of rural disability, this paper tackles {{the idea of the}} ‘rural panopticon’. Inspired by empirical research on mental ill-health in the Scottish Highlands, the authors specify certain workings of the rural panopticon, stressing interconnections between visibility, observation, surveillance, chatter and interiorised senses of self-disciplining (particularly for those with fragile mental health). There are suggestions that Bentham regarded his institutional brain-child, the Panopticon, as most logically and properly an urban phenomena, even calling it ‘Panopticon Town’, but there is a supplementary argument that identifies a rural vision – of a virtuous, <b>self-regulating</b> farming <b>community</b> – present in the margins of his Panopticon thinking. Through the figure of the ‘glass palace’ in the countryside, emphasising the pervasive watching, judging and censuring of conduct, a further link is made from Bentham's Panopticon to the rural panopticon. The paper explores this link both textually and though the Highlands case study, concluding by examining Foucault's dual attention to both Bentham's Panopticon and a rural colony for delinquent boys, Mettray, as twin exemplars of ‘panopticism’ in the disciplining of troublesome and troubled populations (those with disabilities included) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{envision}} {{that many}} usage scenarios involving computational grids {{will be based}} on small, dynamic working groups for which the ability to establish transient collaboration with little or no intervention from resource administrators is a key requirement. Current grid security mechanisms support individual users who are members of well-defined virtual organizations. Recent research seeks to provide manageable grid security services for <b>self-regulating,</b> stable <b>communities.</b> Our prior work with component-based systems for grid computation demonstrated a need to support spontaneous, limited, short-lived collaborations. Such collaborations most often rely on shared or delegated fine grained access privileges to data and executable files as well as to grid compute resources. The mechanisms we are developing focus on the management and the enforcement of fine grained access rights. Our solution employs standard attribute certificates to bind rights to users (or their surrogates) and enables the high level management of such fine grained privileges which may be freely delegated, traded, and combined. Enforcement is provided by POSIX operating systems extensions that extend standard file permissions and regulate resource usage through access control lists. These extensions are available for common platforms and fully support legacy services. In combination, our privilege management and enforcement mechanisms are compatible with and enable the usage of fine-grained rights, leverage other work in the grid computing and security communities, reduce administrative costs to resource providers, enable ad-hoc collaboration through incremental trust relationships and can be used to provide improved security service to long-lived communities. 1...|$|R
40|$|There {{is great}} {{controversy}} on how different set anode potentials affect {{the performance of}} a bioelectrochemical system (BES). It is often reported that more positive potentials improve acclimation and performance of exoelectrogenic biofilms, and alter microbial community structure, while in other studies relatively more negative potentials were needed to achieve higher current densities. To address this issue, the biomass, electroactivity, and community structure of anodic biofilms were examined over a wide range of set anode potentials (- 0. 25, - 0. 09, 0. 21, 0. 51, and 0. 81 V vs a standard hydrogen electrode, SHE) in single-chamber microbial electrolysis cells. Maximum currents produced using a wastewater inoculum increased with anode potentials in the range of - 0. 25 to 0. 21 V, but decreased at 0. 51 and 0. 81 V. The maximum currents were positively correlated with increasing biofilm biomass. Pyrosequencing indicated biofilm communities were all similar and dominated by bacteria most similar to Geobacter sulfurreducens. Differences in anode performance with various set potentials suggest that the exoelectrogenic <b>communities</b> <b>self-regulate</b> their exocellular electron transfer pathways to adapt to different anode potentials. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to secondhand {{tobacco smoke}} (SHS) {{is a risk}} factor for illness and disease. Most studies and {{legislation}} have focussed on SHS in indoor settings. However, research increasingly demonstrates exposure to SHS is measurable in outdoor locations and potentially harmful. This has resulted in interest in establishing policy and legislation for smoke-free outdoor areas (SFOA). This study aimed to examine the proportion of NSW councils with SFOA policy and to explore the enablers and barriers to councils introducing SFOA policy. In addition, we explored whether the diffusion of innovation theory explained the uptake of SFOA policy by councils. In 2011, a survey of NSW Council staff members was undertaken to examine the existence and specifics of SFOA policy, and enablers and barriers associated with its introduction. The perceived usefulness of a resource kit was also measured. Eighty-five (57 %) NSW councils had SFOA policy, with playgrounds (99 %) most likely to be covered. More urban councils (79. 5 %) had SFOA policy compared to rural councils (33 %). The most frequently cited enabler was direct advocacy letters, followed by having a champion councillor or council staff member. The most commonly mentioned barrier was a lack of resources to implement the policy. Cost of implementing the policy varied between councils, with the average cost being $ 18, 747. Uncertainty of how the policy would be enforced was another barrier to adoption. However, most councils reported the policy was <b>self-regulated</b> by the <b>community,</b> rather than enforced with infringement notices. Of participants that had seen the SFOA resource kit over 80 % indicated that it was useful. We found that urban councils more readily adopted SFOA policy, with advocacy and support from NGOs being important elements increasing the likelihood of policy being introduced. It appears that urban councils {{are more likely to be}} innovators or early adopters in the introduction of SFOA policy. With this in mind, public health advocates in other jurisdictions may work with such councils in the early stages of similar projects to accelerate the adoption of public health and tobacco control policies. Strategies that support rural councils also need to be implemented to address disparities in policy introduction...|$|R
