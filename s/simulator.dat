5|$|Written by Stephen Gallagher, this {{script was}} {{submitted}} in late 1982 but rejected by Saward {{on grounds of}} cost. The four-part story would involve the Doctor, Tegan and Turlough testing a Reality <b>Simulator.</b> This <b>simulator</b> projects a graveyard world overrun by the Vodyani who soon {{find a way out}} of the virtual reality and into the real world.|$|E
5|$|Coffee Stain Studios {{released}} Goat <b>Simulator</b> worldwide on 1 April 2014, {{aware that}} tying the date with April Fools' Day may raise doubts on {{the validity of}} the game. Those that pre-ordered the game through Coffee Stain's website received early access to the title three days ahead of release. The official release trailer for Goat <b>Simulator</b> is a loose parody of the highly praised teaser trailer released for Dead Island, showing, among shots of the game, reversed slow-motion footage of the goat crashing through a building after being launched from an exploding gas station.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited was {{the first}} self-published game {{released}} by Looking Glass Technologies. It was intended to establish the company as a video game publisher and to compete with flight <b>simulator</b> franchises such as Microsoft Flight <b>Simulator.</b> Project leader Seamus Blackley, a particle physicist and amateur pilot, conceived the game in 1992. He felt that other flight simulators failed to convey the experience of real flight, and he reacted by coding a simulated atmosphere for Flight Unlimited based on real-time computational fluid dynamics. Aerobatic pilot Michael Goulian endorsed the game and assisted the team in making it more true to life.|$|E

5|$|North American shipped {{spacecraft}} CM-012 to Kennedy Space Center on August 26, 1966 under a conditional Certificate of Flight Worthiness: 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes had to {{be completed}} at KSC. But that was not all; an additional 623 engineering change orders were made and completed after delivery. Grissom became so frustrated with {{the inability of the}} training <b>simulator</b> engineers {{to keep up with the}} spacecraft changes, that he took a lemon from a tree by his house and hung it on the <b>simulator.</b>|$|E

5|$|The team {{sought to}} create an {{immersive}} world for the player and {{to compete with the}} Microsoft Flight <b>Simulator</b> series. Commercially, Flight Unlimited II performed well enough to recoup its development costs. Critics lauded the game's graphics and simulated airspace, and several praised its physics. However, some considered the game to be inferior to Microsoft Flight <b>Simulator</b> '98. Following the completion of Flight Unlimited II, its team split up to develop Flight Unlimited III (1999) and Flight Combat (later Jane's Attack Squadron) simultaneously. Both projects were troubled, and they contributed to the closure of Looking Glass in May 2000.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reaction}} was generally favourable, with reviewers being {{impressed by the}} beauty of the graphics and the thrilling depiction of speed.

5|$|Sonic Colors {{features}} a co-operative two-player mode titled Eggman's Sonic <b>Simulator.</b> In this mode, players control Sonic-modeled robots or their Mii characters {{through a series}} of levels. These levels can be unlocked by collecting special Red Star Rings hidden throughout each act. Completing Sonic <b>Simulator</b> levels rewards the player Chaos Emeralds, and once all seven are collected, Sonic can transform into Super Sonic after collecting 50 rings in normal levels. As Super Sonic, players are invincible and can boost infinitely, though they cannot use Wisps and lose one ring per second, de-transforming when the ring counter hits zero. The game also features online leaderboards, allowing players to upload their scores via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.|$|E
5|$|The first 737, LN-SUS, {{landed in}} Oslo on 8 January 1969, {{followed}} by LN-SUP on 31 January. Braathens SAFE was the launch customer of the F-28, {{and the first}} plane landed in Oslo on 3 March. Five F-28s were delivered {{in the course of}} a year, in addition to one aircraft that was leased periodically until 1971. There were several technical problems due to having the earliest models of the F-28, causing some operational difficulties. Two DC-6s were sold, and all but three of the F-27s were sold to Fokker between October 1968 and May 1969. Along with the aircraft came a new <b>simulator,</b> and the <b>simulator</b> division was moved from Sola to Fornebu. On 27 February 1970, the company took into use an IT-system, based at Sola.|$|E

30|$|At present, WSN {{simulations}} mainly involve two parts: node system {{modeling and}} network modeling. The node system includes the {{hardware and software}} of a sensor node; the network modeling handles the interconnections among nodes. According to the key techniques they adopt, the existing WSN <b>simulators</b> {{can be divided into}} 3 categories: network <b>simulators,</b> node emulators and node <b>simulators.</b> Network <b>simulators</b> refer to the general-purpose network <b>simulators</b> that have been applied to WSN simulations. They emphasize on the network modeling and are enhanced with WSN-specific node models. Node emulators principally focus on the modeling of embedded software execution. They include the operating system emulators and instruction set <b>simulators</b> (ISS) of the processing unit on sensor nodes. Node <b>simulators</b> are generally developed in SLDLs which can provide behavioral models of sensor nodes and are compatible to the design flow of embedded systems.|$|R
50|$|Most modern <b>simulators</b> support both single- and multiplayer. Also many <b>simulators</b> {{belong to}} more than one category.|$|R
