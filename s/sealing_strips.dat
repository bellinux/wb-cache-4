40|$|The {{effects of}} load factor and rotor {{eccentricity}} were determined on flow conditions in test series for two stages. The {{results indicate that}} swirl-type entry flow follows the rules of potential swirl. Within the labyrinth cavities two spatial separated flow areas are considered. A dominating flow in periphera direction nearly fills {{the space between the}} <b>sealing</b> <b>strips</b> and the ceiling of the cavity. Below this flow, an area of axial mass transport is situated, with a slight peripheral component, limited on the nearest surroundings of the seals gap and the rotor surface. Between both flows, an exchange of energy takes place. Within the gaps, flow direction depends on axial velocity and therefore on variable flow contraction. A balance of energy within the seal and the cavities interprets the results of lateral force measurements as an influence of friction at the <b>sealing</b> <b>strips</b> surface and the rotating shaft surface.

40|$|In this project, Stora Enso’s newly {{developed}} building {{system has been}} further developed to allow building to the Swedish passive house standard for the Swedish climate. The building system {{is based on a}} building framework of CLT (Cross laminated timber) boards. The concept has been tested on a small test building. The experience gained from this test building has also been used for planning a larger building (two storeys with the option of a third storey) with passive house standard with this building system. The main conclusions from the project are:  It is possible to build airtight buildings with this technique without using traditional vapour barriers. Initial measurements show that this can be done without reaching critical humidity levels in the walls and roof, at least where wood fibre insulation is used, as this has a greater capacity for storing and evening out the moisture than mineral wool. However, the test building has so far not been exposed to internal generation of moisture (added moisture from showers, food preparation etc.). This needs to be investigated and this will be done during the winter 2013 - 14.  A new fixing method for doors and windows has been tested without traditional fibre filling between them and the CLT panel. The door or window is pressed directly on to the CLT panel instead, with an expandable sealing strip between them. This has been proved to be successful.  The air tightness between the CLT panels is achieved with expandable <b>sealing</b> <b>strips</b> between the panels. The position of the <b>sealing</b> <b>strips</b> is important, both for the air tightness itself and to allow rational assembly.  Recurrent air tightness measurements show that the air tightness decreased somewhat during the first six months, but not {{to such an extent that}} the passive house criteria were not fulfilled. The reason for the decreased air tightness is not clear, but can be due to small movements in the CLT construction and also to the <b>sealing</b> <b>strips</b> being affected by changing outdoor temperatures.  Long term measurements (at least two years) have to be carried out before more reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding the long term effect of the construction on air tightness and humidity in the walls.  An economic analysis comparing using a concrete frame or the studied CLT frame for a three storey building shows that it is probably more expensive to build with CLT. For buildings higher than three floors, the CLT frame has economic advantages, mainly because of the shorter building time compared to using concrete for the frame. In this analysis, no considerations have been taken to differences in the influence on the environment or the global climate between the two construction methods...|$|E

A series of experiments were carried out to ascertain how reproducible the results are and to determine the sensitivity of the method for differentiating the effect of various protective layers. An objective assessment was made possible by using a specially devised scanning-and interpretation method.

The deviation caused by these methods were much lower than those caused by the recommended use of manual measurements. The series of experiments show that a single trial of the time-dependent plate-loading test is not sufficient for an exact assessment of a protective layer.

40|$|<b>Strip</b> <b>seals</b> {{are used}} in gas turbine engines between two static {{elements}} or between components which do not move relative to each other, such as Nozzle Guide Vanes (NGVs). The key role of a <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> between NGV segments is sealing between the flow through the main stream annulus and the internal air system and to limit inter-segmental movements. In general {{the shape of the}} <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> is a rectangular strip that fits into two slots in adjacent components. The minimum clearance required for static <b>strip</b> <b>seals</b> must be found by accounting for thermal expansion, misalignment, and application, to allow correct fitment of the <b>strip</b> <b>seals.</b> Any increase in leakage raises the cost due to an increase in the cooling air use, which is linked to specific fuel consumption, and it can also alter gas flow paths and performance.

40|$|Bridge {{expansion}} joints, if {{not properly}} designed, constructed, and maintained, {{often lead to}} the deterioration of critical substructure elements. <b>Strip</b> <b>seal</b> expansion joints consisting of a steel extrusion and neoprene gland are one type of expansion joint and are commonly used by the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT). <b>Strip</b> <b>seal</b> expansion joints are susceptible to tears and pull outs that allow water, chlorides, and debris to infiltrate the joint, and subsequently the bearings below. One area of the <b>strip</b> <b>seal</b> that is particularly problematic is where it terminates at the interface between the deck and the barrier rail.

30|$|In present {{concrete}} construction, {{elastic rubber}} strips in sealing and waterproofing joints of assembling segments have been commonly used. For underground concrete structures, standard design for sealing joints uses Ethylene-Propylene-Diene Monomer (EPDM) polymer rubber strips arranged circumferentially {{on the end}} faces of the segment (Ding et al. 2017). Putty-based composite rubber strips have great viscosity and elasticity, which can compensate {{to a certain degree}} for the adverse effect of the interface defects at joints. To evaluate the waterproofing ability at joints, special attention is directed to the sealant behavior of the EPDM <b>sealing</b> <b>strips.</b> A time-dependent constitutive model is proposed to assess the long-term waterproof ability of EPDM rubber used in segmental joints (Shi et al. 2015). At present, there are few requirements for rubber strips in the design specifications, and there is limited understanding of the relationship between applied forces and waterproofing performance. In addition, precast concrete structures incorporate a groove at the joint interface for the rubber strip positioning (Hu et al. 2009). The type of groove at the joint interface can limit rubber strip lateral deformation, which can increase pressure on the strip and improve waterproofing ability. The various types of grooves offer different degrees of constraint. Therefore, mechanical properties of rubber strips along with groove design at precast concrete structure joints are key elements in waterproof design. The joint open width is also regarded as a key performance indicator, since it is the weakest part of the shield segmental lining (Liao et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2015). As the weakest and vulnerable point in the segmental lining, joints have been investigated in experiments (Ding et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2015; Kiani et al. 2016), numerical analyses (Ding et al. 2004; Teachavorasinskun and Chub-uppakarn 2010) and case studies (Jun 2011; Basnet and Panthi 2018). Testing apparatus was designed to accurately monitor water leakage pressure of segmental joints under various combinations of opening and offsets (Ding et al. 2017). Molins and Arnau (2011) presented an in situ load test and 3 D numerical simulation on a full-scale segmental lining for the Barcelona metro line. According to a case study in Shanghai, Huang et al. (2017) perceived that longitudinal joints of the metro tunnel have large open widths and lose waterproofing when disrupted by unexpected surcharges.|$|E
40|$|Skanska Sweden has {{produced}} low energy housing since 2009 using prefabricated concrete sandwich elements, as a cost-effective {{way to reach}} high quality and excellent energy performance. Some of these projects have faced problems related to water infiltration due to rainfall during construction, resulting in extra resources for drying the structure, time delays and complicated leakage investigations. If moisture levels remain high when the construction phase is completed, there is risk of moisture damage or inconvenience for the users. Initial interviews and observations at construction- and manufacturing sites reveal some details with large potential for improvement; vertical sandwich element joints, connections between external walls and slabs, external walls and foundation and between balcony door and balcony slab. To improve these details, existing connections and joints were assessed using a list of functional requirements according to Swedish national building regulations that each connection need to fulfil to ensure proper functioning of the building. Suggestions for improvement were gathered and new ideas generated. These propositions were tested by interviewing experts in material purchasing, construction techniques and structural engineering. The study shows {{that there are many}} possible ways to improve connection details to avoid water infiltration without increasing energy losses or air leakage. - Vertical joints can be protected from rain using a P-shaped rubber profile or by changing the geometry of the external facade panel. - Leakage from massive concrete slabs into sandwich walls can be prevented by an vertically extended part of the inner concrete panel or a draining channel for installations. - Self-adhesive <b>sealing</b> <b>strips</b> covering the top of the sandwich elements can prevent moistening of the building materials during transport and construction. - Inserting a rubber or bitumen membrane to the inner concrete panel during casting can ensure drainage and prevent leakage to lower structures such as cellars, terraces or parking garages. - Channels in the balcony slab can ensure drainage without reducing accessibility for disabled persons. However, many of the suggested details increase cost and complicate the assembly of the building. Further studies are required to identify the probability and the consequences of water infiltration to assess the accepted cost of preventing actions. Practical experiments are also needed to establish the performance of each new detail. Details should be better presented on drawings to avoid misunderstandings and it is highly necessary that the designer always consider the constructability of a detail.

30|$|The proper {{assembly}} of underground precast concrete structures is often {{critical in the}} construction of underground structures. In particular, interfacial waterproofing between precast concrete segments is a key factor influencing use, safety, and life span. Current practice is to incorporate waterproofing rubber strips in the design. During the installation process, compressive stress is applied to the strip by post-tensioning to achieve performance. For this paper, lateral constraint compression tests were carried out on composite rubber <b>seal</b> <b>strips</b> that utilize putty. Special waterproofing and sealing test devices were designed to investigate corresponding relationships between water pressure and compressive stress (or strain). A relationship between water resistance pressure and compression stress and strain of the putty-based composite rubber strip was proposed based on the series tests and the control target of the minimum compression strain of the putty composite rubber strip was then suggested.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{processes}} involved in and consequences of sub-zero temperatures on the soil parameters relevant to landfill liners. The main points discussed in this paper are examination of published investigations and theories, determination of the changing material properties by in-situ laboratory experiments, experimental determination of temperature loads in-situ and of influences of real boundary conditions in laboratory tests and possible thermal protection methods. In general a structure will be formed in the material which is characteristic of the matrix of the material and the main influence parameters. The results are a rising moisture content in the frozen zone (in case of cryosuction), a lower dry density (loosening by ice lenses) and normally a lower shear capacity. The permeability measured in a triaxcell of the thawed material is raised within the factor of five - in extreme cases within the factor of ten. On the whole the changes measured in-situ are smaller than those measured in the laboratory. The changes are partly reversible by loading, but the structure created by frost will remain latent. One of the essential influences on soil parameters and reversibility {{is represented by the}} mineralogy of the material. Frost penetration in the clay liner below a drain layer of about 40 cm (gavel d = 16 / 32) could not be measured during two winter periods with normal to light weather conditions. Following a frost penetration, landfill liners covered with a plastic <b>sealing</b> <b>strip</b> alone or a plastic <b>sealing</b> <b>strip</b> and a geotextile showed only slight changes in dry density and moisture content. Changes in permeability were even less marked. For uncovered landfill liners alternating cycles of rain, frost and drying resulted in noticeable changes in dry density, moisture content and soil structure. In conclusion {{it can be said that}} this paper discusses some materials with regard to their suitability as a thermal protection for landfill mineral liners. In addition, a flow chart for work on frost-related problems within compacted-clay landfill liners is proposed. (orig.)

5000|$|Sealing: all control gaps {{as well as}} {{the control}} runs inside the wings are fully sealed. The ailerons are sealed by {{internal}} Teflon boots. The resultant very low friction ensures exceptionally light stick forces. The horizontal stabiliser and rudder retain Teflon and Mylar <b>strip</b> <b>seals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Even when {{strengthened}} by gilding, the image surface {{was still very}} easily marred and the silver was subject to tarnishing from exposure to the air, so the finished plate was bound up with a protective cover glass and <b>sealed</b> with <b>strips</b> of paper soaked in gum arabic. In the US and UK, a gilt brass mat called a preserver in the US and a pinchbeck in Britain. was normally used to separate the image surface from the glass. In continental Europe, a thin cardboard mat or passepartout usually served that purpose.|$|R
