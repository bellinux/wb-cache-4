50|$|There {{are three}} {{processes}} for metallic pipe manufacture. Centrifugal casting of hot alloyed metal {{is one of}} the most prominent process. Ductile iron pipes are generally manufactured in such a fashion. Seamless (SMLS) pipe is formed by drawing a solid billet over a piercing rod to create the hollow shell. As the manufacturing process does not include any welding, <b>seamless</b> <b>pipes</b> are perceived to be stronger and more reliable. Historically, seamless pipe was regarded as withstanding pressure better than other types, and was often more available than welded pipe.|$|E
50|$|Large-diameter pipe (25 cm or greater) may be ERW, EFW or Submerged Arc Welded ("SAW") pipe. There are two {{technologies}} {{that can be}} used to manufacture steel pipes of sizes larger than the steel pipes that can be produced by seamless and ERW processes. The two types of pipes produced through these technologies are longitudinal-submerged arc-welded (LSAW) and spiral-submerged arc-welded (SSAW) pipes. LSAW are made by bending and welding wide steel plates and most commonly used in oil and gas industry applications. Due to their high cost, LSAW pipes are seldom used in lower value non-energy applications such as water pipelines. SSAW pipes are produced by spiral (helicoidal) welding of steel coil and have a cost advantage over LSAW pipes, as the process uses coils rather than steel plates. As such, in applications where spiral-weld is acceptable, SSAW pipes may be preferred over LSAW pipes. Both LSAW pipes and SSAW pipes compete against ERW pipes and <b>seamless</b> <b>pipes</b> in the diameter ranges of 16”-24”.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Linearity {{is a very}} {{important}} parameter for <b>seamless</b> steel <b>pipes.</b> A real-time and on-line visual measurement system for <b>seamless</b> steel <b>pipe</b> linearity is presented. The system consists of several structured-light visual sensors. Each sensor can achieve the coordinate of the center of partial steel pipe in its local coordinate system. Through global calibration, all coordinates measured can be transformed into an integrated coordinate system. The linearity error of steel pipe can be assessed. This method can fulfill 100 % on-line and real-time linearity measurement. A pair structure-light sensor is designed to improve accuracy and a suspension-wires method for sensor calibration and global calibration is used. Through experiments, it shows that the method not only meets the need of precise calibration but also significantly improves the efficiency and feasibility...|$|R
