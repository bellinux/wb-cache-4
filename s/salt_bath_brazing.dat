However, an excessive <b>salt</b> <b>bath</b> temperature leads to rapid grain growth and generates melting voids. The initial degree of dynamic recrystallization, which depends on the extrusion ratio, affects the globular grain size. With an increasing extrusion ratio, the dynamic recrystallization becomes more severe and the dynamic recrystallized grain size becomes smaller. It results in the globular grains becomes smaller. The major growth mechanism of globular grains is Ostwald ripening. Furthermore, high-temperature compressibility can be improved by the TS-SIMA process.

40|$|Abstract. The QPQ complex <b>salt</b> <b>bath</b> {{treatment}} {{is a type}} of surface strengthening technology which contains mainly <b>salt</b> <b>bath</b> nitriding and <b>salt</b> <b>bath</b> post-oxidizing processes. The effect of nitriding temperature and duration on the corrosion resistance of QPQ treated specimens is explored by immersion tests and salt spray tests in this paper. The material used in this study was 1020 annealed steel. In the immersion tests, the specimens were immersed in 3 ‰H 2 O 2 and 10 % NaCl water solution. In the salt spray tests, specimens were salt spray tested using a 5 % NaCl neutral solution. The data indicate that, when the nitriding duration is less than 2 hours at temperature below 590 (phase change will exist when the nitriding temperature is above 590 according to Fe-N phase diagram), the higher temperature of the <b>salt</b> <b>bath</b> nitriding, the specimens will have the higher corrosion resistance. In addition we have found that nitriding for too short a time generates a thin compound layer, and nitriding for too long generates too much porosity.
