25|$|Law {{decided that}} the November party conference was {{the perfect time to}} {{announce}} the withdrawal of the Referendum Pledge, and that Lord Lansdowne <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> because he had been leader in the House of Lords when the pledge was made and because of his relatively low profile during the original tariff reform dispute. When the conference opened the British political world was febrile; on 12 November the opposition had narrowly defeated the government on an amendment to the Home Rule Bill, and the next evening, amidst hysterical shouting from the opposition, Asquith attempted to introduce a motion reversing the previous vote. As the MPs filed {{out at the end of}} the day Winston Churchill began taunting the opposition, and in his anger Ronald McNeil hurled a copy of Standing Orders of the House at Churchill, hitting him on the head. Law refused to condemn the events, and it seems apparent that while he had played no part in organising them they had been planned by the party Whips. As party leader, he was most likely aware of the plans even if he did not actively participate.|$|E

500|$|The tritium leak, {{combined}} with other disclosures about improper handling and disposal of hazardous waste, had caused Secretary of Energy Federico Peña to fire the lab's previous manager, Associated Universities, Inc.

[...] Marburger set up a permanent community advisory council and met with local environmental groups to increase communication between them and the laboratory's management. By 2001, when Marburger left to join the Bush administration, local environmental groups credited him with having largely dissipated the distrust that had existed between the groups when he started.|$|E

500|$|Ed Boon {{recalled}} that for {{six out of}} the eight months {{while they were in}} production of the original Mortal Kombat, [...] "nobody could come up with a name nobody didn't hate". Some of the names suggested included [...] "Kumite", [...] "Dragon Attack", [...] "Death Blow" [...] and just [...] "Fatality". Someone had written down [...] "combat" [...] on the drawing board for the names in Boon's office and then someone wrote a K over the C, according to Boon, [...] "just to be kind of weird". Steve Ritchie, a pinball designer at that time, was sitting in Boon's office and saw the word [...] "Kombat" [...] and said to Boon, 'Why don't you name it Mortal Kombat?' and that name [...] "just stuck". Since then, the series uses the letter [...] "K" [...] in place of [...] "C" [...] for various words containing the hard C sound. According to Boon, during the MK games' development they usually spell the words correctly and only [...] "korrect it" [...] when one of the developers points out they <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} Lizard {{merchandise}} designs along with unconfirmed concept art featuring a humanoid-shape {{with a layer}} of scales on top instead of a pronounced snout (similar to a dinosaur or crocodile) as in the most recent comics, produced a mixed reaction. Many commenters compared it to other fictional characters instead of his rendering in comics. Russ Fischer of /Film described the character as looking more [...] "Steve Ditko derived" [...] (the character's original artist). Webb felt that there are different incarnations of Lizard in the comic book. He felt that he <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> without the snout because he was interested more in human emotions and wanted to keep Rhys' presence in the creature. Webb wanted him to have emotion, have a face and have feeling. He stated [...] "that in a comic book, you just put that thing up there, and you can say, oh, thought bubble, whatever. But when you try to do that and make it look real, it's a different challenge, and I'm creating a movie, I'm not creating a comic book. That was part of the design." ...|$|E

If anybody wishes to complain, he <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{to the people who}} make the rules." [...] Somerset's president, Colin Atkinson spoke to representatives from Worcestershire the day after the game and offered to play the match again, but his suggestion was rejected. The TCCB chairman, Carr, made a statement after the game that [...] "Somerset's action is totally contrary to the spirit of the competition, but is not in breach of the rules as they are written" [...] and announced that an inquiry would be held at season's end. However, due to the strength and volume of complaints, a special meeting of the TCCB was called for 1 June. At that meeting, Somerset were disqualified from the competition by seventeen votes to one. Only the representative from Derbyshire opposed it, with even Somerset voting for the expulsion. Due to Somerset's disqualification, Glamorgan joined Worcestershire in the quarter-finals. As it turned out, had Somerset played the game as normal, they would have qualified, as Glamorgan's match against the Minor Counties ended with no result due to rain, leaving them two points behind Somerset and Worcestershire.|$|E

500|$|Singapore has a one person, {{one vote}} system: plural voting– that is, voting {{more than once}} in the electoral {{division}} that one is assigned to, or voting in more than one electoral division– is illegal. Following a relative swing in votes against the ruling People's Action Party government in the general election of 1984, the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew raised the possibility of modifications to the one person, one vote system and said: [...] "It is necessary to try and put some safeguards into the way in which people use their votes to bargain, coerce, to push, to jostle and get what they want without running the risk of losing the services of the government, because one day, by mistake, they will lose the services of the government." [...] Subsequently, in an interview to the US magazine Foreign Affairs in January 1994, Lee, now Senior Minister, suggested that a person between the ages of 40 and 60 with a family should be given two votes because [...] "he is likely to be more careful, voting also for his children. He is more likely to vote in a serious way than a capricious young man under 30. But we haven't found it necessary yet. If it became necessary, we <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> ... I'm not intellectually convinced that one-man, one-vote is the best. We practise it because that's what the British bequeathed us and we haven't really found a need to challenge that."

500|$|In 2007, after Pearl Jam's 2006 tour had ended, {{the band}} members began {{recording}} demo material on their own while staying in occasional contact via e-mail.

After the band was invited to record The Who's [...] "Love, Reign o'er Me" [...] for the Reign Over Me soundtrack, they opted to call long-time collaborator Brendan O'Brien to produce their cover. During the experience, O'Brien and Pearl Jam decided it was a good time for them to work again in a studio album. This ninth album would mark O'Brien's first production credit with Pearl Jam since 1998's Yield. The band allowed O'Brien greater latitude in determining the sound of Backspacer. [...] "At this point, I think we're willing to let somebody cut the songs up a little bit," [...] says lead vocalist Eddie Vedder. [...] "In the past, Brendan would say, 'It's a great song, but I think you <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in a different key', and we'd say no. But now that we've heard Bruce [...] has listened to his suggestions, I think we will too." [...] Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "He brings a brutally honest approach to what he thinks is working and what isn't, and it really moves things along... We don't get weighted down with ideas that maybe aren't even that good. He's one of the few people outside of the band that we trust with our music, and we're really, really looking forward to making this record." ...|$|E
500|$|In Australia, while Jardine's unfriendly {{approach}} and superior manner caused some friction {{with the press}} and spectators, the early tour matches were uncontroversial and Larwood and Voce had a light workload {{in preparation for the}} Test series. The first signs of trouble came in the match against a representative [...] "Australian XI" [...] at near full strength, in which the bowlers first used Bodyline tactics. Under the captaincy of Bob Wyatt (Jardine having rested from the match), the England attack bowled short and around leg stump, with fielders positioned close by on the leg side to catch any deflections. Wyatt later claimed this was not pre-planned and he simply informed Jardine what had happened. The Bodyline tactics continued in the next match and several players, including Jack Fingleton, were hit. The Australian press were shocked and criticised the hostility of Larwood in particular. Some former Australian players joined the criticism, saying the tactics were ethically wrong. However, at this stage, not everyone was opposed, and the Australian Board of Control believed the English team had bowled fairly. On the other hand, Jardine increasingly came into disagreement with tour manager Warner over Bodyline as the tour progressed. Warner hated Bodyline but would not speak out against it. He was accused of hypocrisy for not taking a stand on either side, particularly after expressing sentiments {{at the start of the}} tour that cricket [...] "has become a synonym for all that is true and honest.

500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they figure you know what to do, and you <b>should</b> <b>do</b> <b>it...</b> And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story."
