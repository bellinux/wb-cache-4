25|$|There are {{two types}} of hybrid formats which contain {{standard}} DVD-Video format video for playback in regular DVD players, and HD DVD video for playback in high definition on HD DVD players. The Combo disc is a dual sided disc with one side DVD and the other HD DVD, each of which can have up to two layers. The Twin disc is a single sided disc that can have up to three layers, with up to two layers dedicated to either DVD or HD DVD. These hybrid discs make retail marketing and shelf <b>space</b> <b>management</b> easier. Another advantage is hardware cross-compatibility. The average consumer does {{not have to worry about}} whether or not they can play a hybrid DVD: any standard home DVD player can access the DVD-encoded content and any HD DVD player can access both the DVD- and HD DVD-encoded content.|$|E

40|$|<b>Space</b> traffic <b>management</b> has often, {{for example}} in the IAA Cosmic Study of 2006, been rather broadly defined as “the set of {{technical}} and regulatory provisions for promoting safe access into outer space, operations in outer space and return from space to Earth free of physical or radio-frequency interference. ” Oftentimes, especially in space law literature, references or even comparisons {{have been made to}} traffic management as it has developed in aviation and (to a lesser extent) in maritime transport. However, it should be realized that <b>space</b> traffic <b>management,</b> especially under the definition quoted, comprises a considerably larger range of activities than air traffic <b>management.</b> If <b>space</b> traffic <b>management</b> is ever to become feasible, therefore, rather than just referring to air and/or maritime traffic management, first a high-level overview should be performed of what <b>space</b> traffic <b>management</b> effectively will comprise, what has already been taken care of and to what extent, and where perhaps guidance from the aviation realm may be useful after all. The present paper will provide such a first high-level inventory, duly taking into account the various special features of space activities which may provide major obstacles for any truly comprehensive <b>space</b> traffic <b>management</b> regime, much more so than in the airspaces of this world...|$|R
