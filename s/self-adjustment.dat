2500|$|From {{the point}} of view of today's {{mainstream}} schools of economic thought, government should strive to keep the interconnected macroeconomic aggregates money supply and/or aggregate demand on a stable growth path. When threatened by the forecast of a depression central banks should pour liquidity into the banking system and the government should cut taxes and accelerate spending in order to keep the nominal money stock and total nominal demand from collapsing. At the beginning of the Great Depression most economists believed in Say's law and the self-equilibrating powers of the market and failed to explain the severity of the Depression. Outright leave-it-alone liquidationism was a position mainly held by the Austrian School. The liquidationist position was that a depression is good medicine. The idea was the benefit of a depression was to liquidate failed investments and businesses that have been made obsolete by technological development in order to release factors of production (capital and labor) from unproductive uses so that these could be redeployed in other sectors of the technologically dynamic economy. They argued that even if <b>self-adjustment</b> of the economy took mass bankruptcies, then so be it. An increasingly common view among economic historians is that the adherence of some Federal Reserve policymakers to the liquidationist thesis led to disastrous consequences. Regarding the policies of President Hoover, economists like Barry Eichengreen and J. Bradford DeLong point out that President Hoover tried to keep the federal budget balanced until 1932, when he lost confidence in his Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon and replaced him. Despite liquidationist expectations, a large proportion of the capital stock was not redeployed but vanished during the first years of the Great Depression. According to a study by Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers, the recession caused a drop of net capital accumulation to pre-1924 levels by 1933. Milton Friedman called the leave-it-alone liquidationism [...] "dangerous nonsense". He wrote: ...|$|E

So he sits and ponders, abstractly, vaguely, upon everything in general,--synonym, alas, to man's finite mind, for nothing in particular,--till even the sense of self seems to vanish, and through the mist-like portal of unconsciousness he floats out into the vast indistinguishable sameness of Nirvana's sea.|$|E
6000|$|Exactly {{the same}} thing occurs in organic nature. We see some one {{wonderful}} case of adjustment, some unusual development of an organ, but we pass over the hundreds of cases in which that adjustment and development do not occur. No doubt when one adjustment is absent another takes its place, because no organism can continue to exist that is not adjusted to its environment; and unceasing variation with unlimited powers of multiplication, in most cases, furnish the means of <b>self-adjustment.</b> The world is so constituted, that {{by the action of}} general laws there is produced the greatest possible variety of surface and of climate; and by the action of laws equally general, the greatest possible variety of organisms have been produced, adapted to the varied conditions of every part of the earth. Tho objector would probably himself admit, that the varied surface of the earth--the plains and valleys, the hills and mountains, the deserts and volcanoes, the winds and currents, the seas and lakes and rivers, and the various climates of the earth--are all the results of general laws acting and re-acting during countless ages; and that the Creator does not appear to guide and control the action of these laws--here determining the height of a mountain, there altering the channel of a river--here making the rains more abundant, there changing the direction of a current. He would probably admit that the forces of inorganic nature are self-adjusting, and that the result necessarily fluctuates about a given mean condition (which is itself slowly changing), while within certain limits the greatest possible amount of variety is produced. If then a [...] "contriving mind" [...] is not necessary at every step of the process of change eternally going on in the inorganic world, why are we required to believe in the continual action of such a mind in the region of organic nature? True, the laws at work are more complex, the adjustments more delicate, the appearance of special adaptation more remarkable; but why should we measure the creative mind by our own? Why should we suppose the machine too complicated, to have been designed by the Creator so complete that it would necessarily work out harmonious results? The theory of [...] "continual interference" [...] is a limitation of the Creator's power. It assumes that he could not work by pure law in the organic, as he has done in the inorganic world; it assumes that he could not foresee the consequences of the laws of matter and mind combined--that results would continually arise which are contrary to what is best, and that he has to change what would otherwise be the course of nature, in order to produce that beauty, and variety, and harmony, which even we, with our limited intellects, can conceive {{to be the result of}} <b>self-adjustment</b> in a universe governed by unvarying law. If we could not conceive the world of nature to be self-adjusting and capable of endless development, it would even then be an unworthy idea of a Creator, to impute the incapacity of our minds to him; but when many human minds can conceive, and can even trace out in detail some of the adaptations in nature as the necessary results of unvarying law, it seems strange that, in the interests of religion, any one should seek to prove that the System of Nature, instead of being above, is far below our highest conceptions of it. I, for one, cannot believe that the world would come to chaos if left to Law alone. I cannot believe that there is in it no inherent power of developing beauty or variety, and that the direct action of the Deity is required to produce each spot or streak on every insect, each detail of structure in every one of the millions of organisms that live or have lived upon the earth. For it is impossible to draw a line. If any modifications of structure could be the result of law, why not all? If some self-adaptations could arise, why not others? If any varieties of colour, why not all the varieties we see? No attempt is made to explain this, except by reference to the fact that [...] "purpose" [...] and [...] "contrivance" [...] are everywhere visible, and by the illogical deduction that they could only have arisen from the direct action of some mind, because the direct action of our minds produces similar [...] "contrivances"; but it is forgotten that adaptation, however produced, must have the appearance of design. The channel of a river looks as if made for the river, although it is made by it; the fine layers and beds in a deposit of sand, often look as if they had been sorted, and sifted, and levelled, designedly; the sides and angles of a crystal exactly resemble similar forms designed by man; but we do not therefore conclude that these effects have, in each individual case, required the directing action of a creative mind, or see any difficulty in their being produced by natural Law.|$|E

50|$|Toilets {{accounted}} for almost 30% of residential indoor water {{use in the}} United States in 1999. One flush of a standard U.S. toilet requires more water than most individuals, and many families, in the world use for all their needs in an entire day.A home’s toilet water sustainability can be improved {{in one of two}} ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet. To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank. Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase. A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A float booster attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets. It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush. A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks. A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month. One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color. In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows <b>self-adjustment</b> of the amount of water per flush.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the impact of different instructional constraints on standing board jump (sbj) performance in children and understand the underlying changes in emergent movement patterns. Two groups of novice participants were provided with either externally or internally focused attentional instructions during an intervention phase. Pre- and post-test sessions were undertaken to determine changes to performance and movement patterns. Thirty-six primary fourth-grade male students were recruited for this study and randomly assigned to either an external, internal focus or control group. Different instructional constraints with either an external focus (image of the achievement) or an internal focus (image of the act) were provided to the participants. Performance scores (jump distances), and data from key kinematic (joint range of motion, ROM) and kinetic variables (jump impulses) were collected. Instructional constraints with an emphasis on an external focus of attention were generally more effective in assisting learners to improve jump distances. Intra-individual analyses highlighted how enhanced jump distances for successful participants may be concomitant with specific changes to kinematic and kinetic variables. Larger joint ROM and adjustment to a comparatively larger horizontal impulse to a vertical impulse were observed for more successful participants at post-test performance. From a constraints-led perspective, the inclusion of instructional constraints encouraging <b>self-adjustments</b> in the control of movements (i. e., image of achievement) had a beneficial effect on individuals performing the standing broad jump task.

40|$|Currently {{available}} biomechanical {{models of}} the human eyeball focus mainly on the geometries and material properties of its components while {{little attention has been}} given to its optics—the eye's primary function. We postulate that in the evolution process, the mechanical structure of the eyeball has been influenced by its optical functions. We develop a numerical finite element analysis-based model in which the eyeball geometry and its material properties are linked to the optical functions of the eye. This is achieved by controlling in the model all essential optical functions while still choosing material properties from a range of clinically available data. In particular, it is assumed that in a certain range of intraocular pressures, the eye is able to maintain focus. This so-called property of optical <b>self-adjustments</b> provides a more constrained set of numerical solutions in which the number of free model parameters significantly decreases, leading to models that are more robust. Further, we investigate two specific cases of a model that satisfies optical self-adjustment: (1) a full model in which the cornea is flexibly attached to sclera at the limbus, and (2) a fixed cornea model in which the cornea is not allowed to move at the limbus. We conclude that for a biomechanical model of the eyeball to mimic the optical function of a real eye, it is crucial that the cornea is allowed to move at the limbal junction, that the materials used for the cornea and sclera are strongly nonlinear, and that their moduli of elasticity remain in a very close relationship. ...|$|R

40|$|Cochlear outer {{hair cells}} (OHC) are {{commonly}} assumed {{to function as}} mechanical effectors as well as sensory receptors in the organ of Corti (OC) of the inner ear. OHC in vitro and in organ explants exhibit mechanical responses to electrical, chemical or mechanical stimulation which may represent an aspect of their effector process that is expected in vivo. A detailed description, however, of an OHC effector operation in situ is still missing. Specifically, little is known as to how OHC movements influence the geometry of the OC in situ. Previous work has demonstrated that the motility of isolated OHCs in response to electrical stimulation and to K(+) -gluconate is probably under voltage control and causes depolarisation (shortening) and hyperpolarization (elongation). This work was undertaken to investigate if the movements that were observed in isolated OHC, and which are induced by ionic stimulation, could change the geometry of the OC. A synchronized depolarization of OHC was induced in guinea pig cochleae by exposing the entire OC to artificial endolymph (K+). Subsequent morphometry of mid-modiolar sections from these cochleae revealed that {{the distance between the}} basilar membrane (BM) and the reticular lamina (RL) had decreased considerably. Furthermore, in the three upper turns OHC had significantly shortened in all rows. The results suggest that OHC can change their length in the organ of Corti (OC) thus deforming the geometry of the OC. The experiments reveal a tonic force generation within the OC that may change the position of RL and/or BM, contribute to damping, modulate the BM-RL-distance and control the operating points of RL and sensory hair bundles.

40|$|This thesis sets {{to sketch}} Chinese intellectuals’ {{sustained}} efforts {{to search for}} an alternative modernity to the Western model throughout the twentieth century, and uncover the interaction between intellectual politics and Chinese modernity discourse by historicizing and contextualizing Chinese modernity discourse. This study starts with delineating the consistence and the inconsistence of Chinese modernity discourses by juxtaposing different historical conditions and examining reappeared trends of thoughts. Three intellectual currents, i. e., cultural conservatism, humanism, and professionalism, which emerged in the May Fourth period and remerged in the post-socialist condition, are examined to mirror the spiral dynamics and the locus of Chinese modernity. Their respective roles in reconstructing Chinese cultural, ethical and academic orders in response to Western model of modernity are highlighted in the research. Cultural conservatism attempts to legitimize the Chinese culture {{in the framework of}} global modernity by resetting or reinterpreting the dialectical relation between the whole and part, universalism, and essentialism. Humanism emphasizes the standard, the guidance of authority, and the self-perfection to resist the ethical disorder caused by the so-called “modern spirit”, which is embodied by individualism, romanticism, and the immoderate expansion of desire. Professionalism influences the pattern of producing and reproducing knowledge about modernity by re-standardizing the academic and the discursive fields and by remolding the identity of the agents. After exposing how the “alternative modernity” in China, as a discursive-political device, has been produced and repackaged with various contents and meanings, this thesis proceeds to explore the intellectual pedestal of Chinese modernity discourses from two aspects. First, how do the intellectual strategies of self-positioning and position-taking influence knowledge production and reproduction of the Chinese modernity discourse; second, how articulation and re-articulation of modernity discourse reflect the <b>self-adjustments</b> of intellectual politics as well as identity shifts. Through the comparative and diachronic examinations, it poses that, as Chinese modernity discourse is increasingly served as a symbolic capital or a strategy of intellectual politics, it gradually loses its authenticity or even becomes a signifier without signified. Meanwhile, the state-led modernization practice is reversely becoming homogenous, stable, and less diverse, although the dominant ideology, namely, socialism with Chinese characteristics, is, in itself, hybrid, paradoxical, and strategically manufactured. published_or_final_versionComparative LiteratureDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Some elements of family such as family constellation, interaction between parents and kids, interaction among family members, social role in family, characteristics of family members and obstacles in family would give effect on their <b>self-adjustment.</b> Based on the fact, the researcher conducted study with purpose to find out the description of child’s <b>self-adjustment</b> toward alcoholic father and its obstacles. This study was qualitative research purposing to describe kids’ <b>self-adjustment</b> toward alcoholic father. The research subjects consisted of children who have alcoholic father and face difficulties in <b>self-adjustment.</b> This study used unstructured and open interviews and observation as data collecting sample. The analysis technique used descriptive data analysis. The result showed that kids who have alcoholic father faced difficulty and less ability to adjust themselves in having interaction with others because they found obstacles in <b>self-adjustment.</b> The obstacles consisted of <b>self-adjustment</b> or psyches obstacles, feel worry, afraid of being father madness, disappointed of father, shame and less self-confident.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} multicentre, randomised, {{controlled}} {{crossover study}} was to determine the efficacy of adding continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to insulin pump therapy (CSII) in type 1 diabetes. Children and adults (n[*]=[*] 153) on CSII with HbA(1 c) 7. 5 - 9. 5 % (58. 5 - 80. 3 mmol/mol) were randomised to (CGM) a Sensor On or Sensor Off arm for 6 months. After 4 months' washout, participants crossed over to the other arm for 6 months. Paediatric and adult participants were separately electronically randomised through the case report form according to a predefined randomisation sequence in eight secondary and tertiary centres. The primary outcome was the difference in HbA(1 c) levels between arms after 6 months. Seventy-seven participants were randomised to the On/Off sequence and 76 to the Off/On sequence; all were included in the primary analysis. The mean difference in HbA(1 c) was - 0. 43 % (- 4. 74 mmol/mol) in favour of the Sensor On arm (8. 04 % [64. 34 mmol/mol] vs 8. 47 % [69. 08 mmol/mol]; 95 % CI - 0. 32 %, - 0. 55 % [- 3. 50, - 6. 01 mmol/mol]; p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Following cessation of glucose sensing, HbA(1 c) reverted to baseline levels. Less time was spent with sensor glucose < 3. 9 mmol/l during the Sensor On arm than in the Sensor Off arm (19 vs 31 min/day; p[*]=[*] 0. 009). The mean number of daily boluses increased in the Sensor On arm (6. 8 [*]±[*] 2. 5 vs 5. 8 [*]±[*] 1. 9, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001), together with the frequency of use of the temporary basal rate (0. 75 [*]±[*] 1. 11 vs 0. 26 [*]±[*] 0. 47, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and manual insulin suspend (0. 91 [*]±[*] 1. 25 vs 0. 70 [*]±[*] 0. 75, p[*]<[*] 0. 018) functions. Four vs two events of severe hypoglycaemia occurred in the Sensor On and Sensor Off arm, respectively (p[*]=[*] 0. 40). Continuous glucose monitoring was associated with decreased HbA(1 c) levels and time spent in hypoglycaemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes using CSII.

40|$|Coastal {{processes}} during transgression {{have been}} explored through morpho-kinematic simulations using the Shoreface Translation Model (STM). Our STM experiments {{show that the}} landward migration of coastal system {{is controlled by the}} rate of sea level rise (SLR), the rate of sediment supply (Vs), the shelf slope (?), and the morphology of the coastal profile (M). Additionally, the geometric relationships between shoreface and plane of translation govern three kinematic modes of coastal barrier migration: (1) roll-over, (2) hybrid, (3) encroachment. Each mode exhibits differences along the coastal profile in relation to zones of erosion (cut) and redeposition (fill) and to the consequent sediment exchanges across the profile (from the cut to the fill). Each mode produces distinctive facies architectures and specific stratigraphic position of the shoreface-ravinement surface. Environmental conditions (rates of sea-level rise, sediment supply (±), barrier morphology) and kinematic modes both control stratal preservation. Transgressive roll-over, in particular, occurs on gently sloping shelves and involves erosion along the entire shoreface and landward sediment redeposition (by overwash and tidal inlet processes). Three different types of roll-over are possible depending on the conditions of sediment supply (Vs) to the coastal cell: neutral roll-over (Vs= 0 m 3), which produces no effect on the shelf; depositional roll-over (Vs > 0) and erosional (Vs< 0) roll-over, which modify the shelf through stratal preservation and erosion, respectively. These differences are quantified in simulations by tracking parameters that principally relate to the trajectory of a ‘neutral point’ (maximum depth of shoreface erosion). The shoreface-ravinement defines the trajectory in all the transgressions and in principle is preserved in the rock record, making it a much more useful tracking point than the shoreline trajectory analysed in other studies. Coastal migration in all kinematic modes includes state-dependent inertial effects, experimentally well evident when, after a perturbation, the drivers (SLR, Vs, ?, M) are maintained constant for a long interval of time. Kinematic inertia appears as progressive geometric <b>self-adjustments</b> of the barrier until it acquires a shape that is stable under prevailing conditions (constant drivers). At this stage (kinematic equilibrium), which is unlikely ever to be attained in nature, simulated transgressions finally evolve with processes and geological products that remain invariant. Kinematic inertia is likely to be an additional factor that governs the real transgressions under most circumstances...|$|R
40|$|Hypoglycaernia is {{the main}} {{limiting}} factor reaching normo-glycaemia in type I diabetic patients. The risk of hypoglycaemia increases usually with improvements in metabolic control. The annual prevalence of severe episodes of hypoglycaemia in intensively treated patients {{is reported to be}} in the range 20 - 80 %. An estimation of such events, using a questionnaire, in type I diabetic patients attending the outpatient clinic at Danderyd hospital in 1984 and 1998, revealed a frequency of 20 and 21 % respectively. During the same period of time a significant improvement in the HbA 1 c was registered, from 7, 9 to 7, 4 %, p< 0. 001, along with an increased frequency of multiple injection therapy, homemonitoring of blood glucose and <b>self-adjustments</b> of insulin doses. A small group of patients are affected by repeated severe hypoglycaemia (RSH). In 1984 we identified 20 such patients, i. e. about 5 % of the population, who were studied and followed for twelve years. In these patients severe hypoglycaemia remained a problem, although efforts were made to avoid such episodes. The annual incidence did however decline and multiple injection therapy seem to be beneficial compared to single and two dose regimens. These patients were found to have several risk factors, most notably hypoglycaemia unawareness. During the follow up no patient died due to hypoglycaemia. A standardised insulin infusion test is reproducible in patients with and without the problem of RSH. In the RSH group the standardised insulin infusion test resulted in a continues fall in blood glucose, until the test had to be omitted due to the presentation of neuroglucopenic symptoms. The test may therefore be helpful in identifying subjects with the problem of RSH. One important component for the enhanced risk of hypoglycaemia is the blunted counterregulatory response, most notably that of glucagon. Unfortunately, the reason for this blunted glucagon response, as well as means to restore its release during hypoglycaemia is poorly understood. In an acute experiment during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia exogenous C-peptide in a dose raising its concentration to a physiologic level did not interfere with the counterregulatory machinery and in particular, did not restore the glucagon response. However, it slightly enhanced the hypoglycaemic effect of insulin, an effect which is compatible with the known vasodilating effect of C-peptide. Prospective follow up of the glucagon response to hypoglycaemia in newly diagnosed type I diabetic patients, revealed that about 50 % may have a preserved response at 12 - 15 months, in some instances in spite of an absent C-peptide response to a glucagon challenge. Therefore it seems that there is no obvious association between the blunting of the glucagon secretion seen and the disappearance of the endogenous insulin secretion. In the absence of a specific tool to restore the glucagon response to hypoglycaemia it seems that we are presently limited to only a few therapeutic options, one is to prevent as much as possible every single episode of hypoglycaemia and the other being to keep the plasma insulin level between meals within a low physiologic range, avoiding the postprandial hyperinsulinemia associated with conventional insulin treatment. The latter statement is based on the observation that hyperinsulinemia may suppress glucagon secretion. Thus, the L-arginine stimulated glucagon secretion is suppressed by hyperinsulinemia. Furthermore insulin treatment via the i. p. route with the use of an implantable pump enhanced the glucagon response to hypoglycaemia an effect possibly attributed to lower peripheral insulin levels after an insulin challenge. Such treatment also induced a more favourable effect on the glucagon secretion during physical exercise. However the hypoglycaemic effect during exercise was enhanced, underlining the need to reduce the circulating insulin level in connection with exercise...|$|R
