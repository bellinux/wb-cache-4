6000|$|We {{had emerged}} {{into the great}} hall and stood facing the main doorway. The door was open into the portico, through the stone archway of which I saw the garden glitter in the blue light of a full moon. As {{the master of the}} house uttered the words I have just {{repeated}} my companion came slowly up into the porch from without, bareheaded, bright in the outer moonlight, dark {{in the shadow of the}} archway, and bright again in the lamplight at the entrance of the hall. As he crossed the threshold the butler made an appearance at the head of the staircase on our left, faltering visibly a moment at sight of Mr. Searle; after which, noting my friend, he gravely descended. He bore in his hand a small silver tray. On the tray, gleaming in the light of the <b>suspended</b> <b>lamp,</b> lay a folded note. Clement Searle came forward, staring a little and startled, I think, by some quick nervous prevision of a catastrophe. The butler applied the match to the train. He advanced to my fellow visitor, all solemnly, with the offer of his missive. Mr. Searle made a movement as if to spring forward, but controlled himself. [...] "Tottenham!" [...] he called in a strident voice.|$|E
50|$|A {{lampshade}} is {{a fixture}} {{that covers the}} lightbulb on a lamp to diffuse the light it emits. Conical, cylindrical and other forms on floor-, desk- or table top-mounted as well as <b>suspended</b> <b>lamp</b> models {{are the most common}} and are made {{in a wide range of}} materials. The term can also apply to the glass hung under many designs of ceiling lamp. Beyond its practical purpose, significant emphasis is also usually given to decorative and aesthetic features.|$|E

40|$|Photograph of {{a series}} of 4 views of Mexican architecture, showing various street scenes in Mexico, [s. d. ]. The first scene (upper left) shows an ornate {{exterior}} of a building behind a pointed metal fence. The statue of a saint sits in an arched hole in the wall between intricate patterns, all of which stand between two extended brick panels. The second scene (upper right) shows another ornate wall by a sign that reads "H. Santin Pintor Rotulos". What appears to be the statue of a pope/cardinal(?) sits inside an ornate casing with swirled embellishments on its base. The third image (lower left) shows a two-story structure with a small balcony, while the last image (lower right) has a tall cross-topped tower in focus, beside the wall of a large building, at right. Below, a trolley passes beneath a <b>suspended</b> <b>lamp,</b> while part of a utility pole appears at left...|$|E
40|$|Cambridge, {{traveled}} {{across the}} continent to study medicine under Fabricius at Padua. There he remained until 1602 when, upon receiving his doctorate of medicine, he returned to England and located in London. The year 1609 finds him appointed as physician in St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Seven years later, in 1616, he gave his first lectures containing views upon {{the motion of the}} heart and the blood. The content or importance of these lectures or the name of their author need hardly be indicated. Permit me instead to trace the career during this same time of another young man, also a student of medicine. Born in the city of Pisa, he entered the medical school of its University in the year 1 58 1. His attention soon turned, however, to mathematics and physics. Euclid and Archimedes were quickly mastered, and so great became his proficiency that in 1589 he found himself lecturer in mathematics in the very university which he had entered eight years earlier with the intention of becoming a physician. Report has it that while in the cathedral at Pisa his attention was arrested by the swinging of a <b>suspended</b> <b>lamp</b> which seemed upon closer observation to maintain equal intervals of time regardless of differences in the length of swings. He tested this discovery by checking with the beats of his pulse, thus using a physiological phenomenon to measure a physical one; and then having established the more general physical principle, he reversed the procedure by constructing a pendulum clock and using it to measure the rate of beat of the pulse. These physical reflections directed his thought to the physics of Aristotle. One theorem in particular, that referring to the motion of the projectile, greatly interested him. According to Aristotle, force is that which produces motion or velocity. Certainly this definition of force seems to be confirmed {{over and over again in}} our experience. When one brings force to bear upon a table in pushing it the table moves; and when one ceases to push, th...|$|E

25|$|The cup was {{probably}} designed for drinking from at feasts, or more specifically Bacchic cult celebrations, where {{the lack of}} a foot, also a feature found in other cage-cups, may mean it was passed around, as elaborate cups often were in medieval cultures.

The strange luminous semi-opacities of fine autumn afternoons and eves intensified into Rembrandt effects the few yellow sunbeams which came through holes and {{divisions in the}} canvas, and spirted like jets of gold-dust across the dusky blue atmosphere of haze pervading the tent, until they alighted on inner surfaces of cloth opposite, and shone like little <b>lamps</b> <b>suspended</b> there.|$|R

50|$|In 1886 a white {{neighbor}} donated a half-acre {{plot of land}} to be {{used for}} a house of worship. Prior to that time various homes in the community had been used for church services or, weather permitting, in neighboring brush arbors. A simple wood frame church was erected on the current spot, but it was destroyed by fire in 1924. It was replaced with the current tile block structure built in 1925-1926. Not having the funds for materials to construct a new church all at once, over a period of months church members would purchase a few tile blocks at a time as money allowed and stacked them on the site. Finally in the fall of 1925 the foundation was laid. The majority of the construction was done by the men of the community and the church over the succeeding months. At first lighting in the completed church was provided by a large <b>suspended</b> carbide <b>lamp.</b> Later, kerosene lamps were added to holders along the walls.|$|R
30|$|The Brooklyn Museum’s lamp {{includes}} a tubular wick-holder {{attached to the}} interior base. Carboni [1] describes an integral glass tube as “the most common way to create a wick-holder on pre-Mamluk objects.” Codified by the 13 th century, the definitive form of the Mamluk mosque lamp—a globular vase with a flaring neck—utilizes a shallow dish <b>suspended</b> within the <b>lamp,</b> which replaced the narrow tubular wick-holders of earlier examples [1, 24]. Interestingly, a mid- 13 th-century lamp in the Victoria and Albert Museum illustrates a progression of form, combining an integral tubular wick-holder with the formal elements of later Mamluk examples, but without the characteristically extensive gilding and enameling [24].|$|R
