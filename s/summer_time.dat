5|$|The name {{of local}} time {{typically}} changes when DST is observed. American English replaces standard with daylight: for example, Pacific Standard Time (PST) becomes Pacific Daylight Time (PDT). In the United Kingdom, the standard term for UK time when advanced by one hour is British <b>Summer</b> <b>Time</b> (BST), and British English typically inserts summer into other time zone names, e.g. Central European Time (CET) becomes Central European <b>Summer</b> <b>Time</b> (CEST).|$|E

5|$|Daylight saving time (abbreviated DST), {{commonly}} referred to as daylight savings time in speech, and known as <b>summer</b> <b>time</b> in some countries, is the practice of advancing clocks during summer months so that evening daylight lasts longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times. Typically, regions that use daylight saving time adjust clocks forward one hour close to the start of spring and adjust them backward in the autumn to standard time.|$|E

5|$|In 1975 the U.S. DOT {{conservatively}} {{identified a}} 0.7% reduction in traffic fatalities during DST, and estimated the real reduction at 1.5% to 2%, but the 1976 NBS {{review of the}} DOT study found no differences in traffic fatalities. In 1995 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimated a reduction of 1.2%, including a 5% reduction in crashes fatal to pedestrians. Others have found similar reductions. Single/Double <b>Summer</b> <b>Time</b> (SDST), a variant where clocks are one hour ahead of the sun in winter and two in summer, has been projected to reduce traffic fatalities by 3% to 4% in the UK, compared to ordinary DST. However, accidents do increase {{by as much as}} 11% during the two weeks that follow the end of British <b>Summer</b> <b>Time.</b> It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts. A correlation between clock shifts and traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. If this effect exists, it is far smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities. A 2009 U.S. study found that on Mondays after the switch to DST, workers sleep an average of 40 minutes less, and are injured at work more often and more severely.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of the United States, where a one-hour shift occurs at 02:00 local time, in spring the clock jumps forward from the last instant of 01:59 {{standard}} time to 03:00 DST and that day has 23hours, whereas in autumn the clock jumps backward from the last instant of 01:59 DST to 01:00 standard time, repeating that hour, and that day has 25hours. A digital display of local time does not read 02:00 exactly at the shift to <b>summer</b> <b>time,</b> but instead jumps from 01:59:59.9 forward to 03:00:00.0.|$|E

5|$|Haifa {{is one of}} the few {{cities in}} Israel where buses operate on Shabbat.

5|$|Start and end dates {{vary with}} {{location}} and year. Since 1996, European <b>Summer</b> <b>Time</b> {{has been observed}} from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October; previously the rules were not uniform across the European Union.

The 2007 U.S. change {{was part of the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005; previously, from 1987 through 2006, the start and end dates were the first Sunday in April and the last Sunday in October, and Congress retains the right {{to go back to the}} previous dates now that an energy-consumption study has been done. Proponents for permanently retaining November as the month for ending DST point to Halloween as a reason to delay the change—to provide extra daylight on October 31.|$|E
