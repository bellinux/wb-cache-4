6000|$|So soon as I arrived I made a {{systematic}} exploration of Shaphambury. To this day I retain the clearest {{memories of the}} plan I shaped out then, and how my inquiries were incommoded by the overpowering desire of every one {{to talk of the}} chances of a German raid, before the Channel Fleet got round to us. I slept at a small public-house in a Shaphambury back street on Sunday night. I did not get on to Shaphambury from Wyvern until two in the afternoon, because of the infrequency of Sunday trains, and I got no clue whatever until late in the afternoon of Monday. As the little local train bumped into sight of the place round the curve of a swelling hill, one saw a series of undulating grassy spaces, amidst which a number of conspicuous notice-boards appealed to the eye and cut up the distant sea horizon. Most of these referred to comestibles or to remedies to follow the comestibles; and they were colored with a view to be memorable rather than beautiful, to [...] "stand out" [...] amidst the gentle grayish tones of the east coast scenery. The greater number, I may remark, of the advertisements that were so conspicuous a factor in the life of those days, and which rendered our vast tree-pulp newspapers possible, referred to foods, drinks, tobacco, and the drugs that promised a restoration of the equanimity these other articles had destroyed. Wherever one went one was reminded in glaring letters that, after all, man was little better than a worm, that eyeless, earless thing that burrows and lives uncomplainingly amidst nutritious dirt, [...] "an alimentary canal with the subservient appendages thereto." [...] But in addition to such boards there were also the big black and white boards of various grandiloquently named [...] "estates." [...] The individualistic enterprise of that time had led to the plotting out of nearly all the country round the seaside towns into roads and building-plots--all but {{a small portion of the}} south and east coast was in this condition, and had the promises of those schemes been realized the entire population of the island might have been accommodated upon the <b>sea</b> <b>frontiers.</b> Nothing of the sort happened, of course; the whole of this uglification of the coast-line was done to stimulate a little foolish gambling in plots, and one saw everywhere agents' boards in every state of freshness and decay, ill-made exploitation roads overgrown with grass, and here and there, at a corner, a label, [...] "Trafalgar Avenue," [...] or [...] "Sea View Road." [...] Here and there, too, some small investor, some shopman with [...] "savings," [...] had delivered his soul to the local builders and built himself a house, and there it stood, ill-designed, mean-looking, isolated, ill-placed on a cheaply fenced plot, athwart which his domestic washing fluttered in the breeze amidst a bleak desolation of enterprise. Then presently our railway crossed a high road, and a row of mean yellow brick houses--workmen's cottages, and the filthy black sheds that made the [...] "allotments" [...] of that time a universal eyesore, marked our approach to the more central areas of--I quote the local guidebook--"one of the most delightful resorts in the East Anglian poppy-land." [...] Then more mean houses, the gaunt ungainliness of the electric force station--it had a huge chimney, because no one understood how to make combustion of coal complete--and then we were in the railway station, and barely three-quarters of a mile from the center of this haunt of health and pleasure.|$|E

5000|$|Western <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontier</b> - the Western <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontier</b> (WESTSEAFRON) {{headquartered}} in San Francisco, {{was responsible for}} the sea defense of the Pacific coast of the United States and Mexico during World War II. The frontier commander was designated Commander, Western <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontier</b> (COMWESTSEAFRON). The Western <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontier</b> was composed of many forces and commands, including the Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Naval Districts. The Western <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontier</b> consisted of the Pacific Coastal regions lying west of the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada as well as of Alaska. On 4 April 1942, Rear Admiral David W. Bagley relieved Rear Admiral Claude C. Bloch as Commandant, 14th Naval District, and Commander, Hawaiian <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontier,</b> and he served in that capacity until January 1943. On 1 February 1943, he assumed command of the Western <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontier</b> and, on 30 March 1943, added the duties of Commandant, 11th Naval District.

5000|$|COMEASTSEAFRON {{had control}} and {{responsibility}} for convoys within its defined area. Convoys from adjacent <b>sea</b> <b>frontiers</b> would continue across sea frontier boundaries. Since the Eastern Sea Frontier coordinated with the Royal Canadian Navy for convoys crossing into the Canadian Coastal Zone, the Eastern Sea Frontier was the [...] "parent" [...] of the contiguous <b>sea</b> <b>frontiers</b> to the south, and COMEASTSEAFRON authority extended beyond its own frontier. COMEASTSEAFRON operational orders could only be appealed to Admiral Ernest King.|$|E

The German U-boat made a last bitter stand in the Trinidad area in the fall of 1942. Since then, coastal waters continued to be relatively safe of the U-boat menace.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontiers</b> under the cognizance of U.S. military authorities, the Canadian Coastal Zone was {{the responsibility of the}} Royal Canadian Navy.

He then became Commander of the latter, with additional duty as Commander North Pacific Force and North Pacific Ocean Area. It was revealed in July 1945, that Task Force 90, under his overall command, had made the first penetration through the Kurile Islands in the Sea of Okhotsk on March 3 and 4, 1945, and the same task force on February 4, 1945, bombarded Paramushir in the first sea bombardment of the Kurile.|$|R

50|$|As {{early as}} 1927 the Navy's {{plans for the}} coastal defense of the United States and its Territories and {{possessions}} provided {{for the establishment of}} Naval Coastal Frontiers that would be larger operational commands than the individual Naval Districts. On 1 July 1941, the Chief of Naval Operations formally established several Naval Coastal Frontiers; on 6 February 1942, these were renamed <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontiers.</b> Each Frontier was a geographic area, usually comprising a number of Naval Districts but including in addition the outer shipping lanes in its sea area. The land areas of the Frontiers corresponded roughly to the Army's Defense Commands, but the boundaries were not identical. The Frontier Commander was usually also the commandant of a Naval District within the Frontier. The chief responsibilities of the <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontiers</b> during World War II were operational; Frontier forces engaged actively in scouting for enemy forces, particularly submarines, and in attack on any enemy units within their boundaries. Toward {{the end of the war}} the Frontiers were assigned administrative and logistic functions in addition to their operational responsibilities.|$|E

However, the prime responsibility of this <b>sea</b> <b>frontier</b> was the protection and defense of the Panama Canal and its operating equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Northwest <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontier</b> - {{established}} as the Pacific Northern Naval Coastal Frontier, became the Northwest <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontier</b> in 1942, with headquarters at Seattle.

For administrative and operational purposes the Frontier was divided into the Northwestern and the Alaskan Sectors. In conjunction with the Army the Frontier maintained the Joint Operations Center at Seattle. On 15 April 1944, the Seventeenth Naval District, which consisted of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, was established, and the Northwest <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontier</b> was abolished.|$|R

5000|$|... "I {{recognize}} that {{the actions of the}} officers were, in general, motivated by a desire to assist in the war effort. However, {{it appears to be a}} fact that some of the officers concerned took advantage of the broad authority that was granted in the interests of secrecy to obtain equipment that did not contribute to the military value of the vessel. Furthermore, the failure to ascertain, prior to or during conversion, that the vessel was unseaworthy is an indication of professional incompetence on the part of the officers concerned. The Commander, Eastern <b>Sea</b> <b>Frontiers,</b> and the Commandant, Third Naval District, after such further investigation as they may deem necessary, will take appropriate corrective and disciplinary action.
