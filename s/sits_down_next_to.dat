50|$|I kind {{of thought}} that the big, standing, fist-in-the-air hero kind of thing was maybe a little too much. This is more modest. He is sitting there holding his hat and looking off in the {{direction}} of Skinner Butte. There is some public art that is not accessible or not very friendly. It seems to get ignored or walked past or spray-painted. I thought this would be a nice scale for kids. They could <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
5000|$|The two ride {{to a bar}} and <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Mike D, {{who tells}} them he's {{planning}} to rob the place.

[...] MCA and Adrock help Mike D escape with the money and jewelry, first causing a distraction and then helping him carry the stolen goods out, along with [...] "Two girlies and a beer that's cold".|$|R

Although Reino is reserved in his nature, he <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Tatiana {{during one of}} the stops of the journey. Tatiana relaxes her head on Reino’s shoulder.

25|$|On 6 May 1791, a tearful {{confrontation}} on {{the floor}} of the Commons (officially, and rather irrelevantly, during a debate on the particulars of a bill for the government of Canada) finally shattered the quarter-century friendship of Fox and Burke, as the latter dramatically crossed the floor of the House <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Pitt, taking the support of a good deal of the more conservative Whigs with him. Later, on his deathbed in 1797, Burke would have his wife turn Fox away rather than allow a final reconciliation.|$|R
5000|$|When ready, {{begin the}} journey {{back through the}} valley, {{cleansed}} and healed, filled with newness... filled with hope... "Filled with Light", seeing, sensing, and understanding everything with crystal clear vision. <b>Sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the stream and lean against a large, smooth rock. Resting your head back, look up to see puffy white clouds. Feel that you are now slowly drifting up and up, as though through a veil, soon to be floating high in the sky... safely and securely caressed by a familiar cloud ("Through the Veil").|$|R

50|$|Lula <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Clay. She accuses him of {{staring at}} her buttocks. She ignores his denials and uses {{stereotypes}} to correctly guess where he lives, where he is going, what Clay's friend, Warren, looks and talks like. Lula guesses that Clay tried to get his own sister {{to have sex with}} him when he was ten. Clay is shocked by her apparent knowledge of his past and says that she must be a friend of Warren.|$|E
50|$|The {{story begins}} {{on the streets}} of the East End of London in the mid-1930s. While roaming the docks at night, the author comes across a small girl sitting on the grating below a shop window. He <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her, and engages her in conversation. Unable to find out where she came from, Fynn takes the child home, only to {{discover}} she is an abused runaway. She spends her next three years as Fynn's inseparable companion.|$|E
60|$|She swept {{a handful}} of {{delicate}} cambric and silk from off a chair, making room for de Batz' portly figure. Then she sat upon the sofa, and with an inviting gesture and {{a call from the}} eyes she bade Armand <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her. She leaned back against the cushions, and the table being close by, she stretched out a hand and once more took up the bunch of narcissi, and while she talked to Armand she held the snow-white blooms quite close to her face--so close, in fact, that he could not see her mouth and chin, only her dark eyes shone across at him {{over the heads of the}} blossoms.|$|R
5000|$|... "After luncheon I {{received}} Queen Emma, the widowed Queen of the Sandwich Islands or Hawaii. Met {{her in the}} Corridor & {{nothing could}} be nicer or more dignified than her manner. She is dark, but not more so than an Indian, with fine feathers features? & splendid soft eyes. She was dressed in just the same widow's weeds as I wear. I took her into the White Drawing room, where I asked <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> me on the sofa. She was moved when I spoke to her of her great misfortune in losing her only child. She was very discreet & would only remain a few minutes. She presented her lady, Mrs. Hoopile whose husband is her Chaplain, both being Hawaiians...." ...|$|R
6000|$|COKESON turns blandly to the JUDGE, {{as though}} to rebuke counsel [...] for not remembering that the JUDGE might wish to have a chance; [...] {{arriving}} at the conclusion that he is to be asked nothing [...] further, he turns and descends from the box, and <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> [...] <b>to</b> JAMES and WALTER.|$|R
5000|$|Beagles {{have the}} ability to {{categorize}} smells. Therefore, they can distinguish between smells emanating from [...] "restricted" [...] items (such as fruit, vegetables, and meat) and non-restricted items. When a member of the Beagle Brigade smells a restricted scent, it <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the luggage to alert its handler, who then talks to the owner, and, if necessary, performs a search. Experienced beagles have a 90% success rate, and can recognize almost 50 distinct smells.|$|E
5000|$|Henri, {{with whom}} Franck {{has built up}} a platonic {{relationship}} (Henri told him he assumes that Franck is not physically attracted to him, and Franck confirmed this), has an intuitive understanding {{of what has happened}} over the past few days, and warns Franck about Michel: [...] "In your shoes, I would be very scared!" [...] Franck is afraid of course, but when his psychopathic lover arrives during the discussion, he leaves Henri for Michel and <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him further along the beach.|$|E
5000|$|The scene {{changes to}} Billy's new home, an {{abandoned}} apartment building, and Superman, in his guise as Clark Kent, drops {{by for a}} visit (subtly using his X-ray vision to find Billy before even entering the building). Billy initially thinks that Kent is from social services, but then Kent reveals himself to be Superman, <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Billy and tells him: [...] "My real name is Clark." [...] This seems to imply that Superman has agreed to become a mentor to Captain Marvel.|$|E
5000|$|Vanessa Timmer has {{referred}} to the early members as [...] "an unlikely group of loosely organized protestors". Frank Zelko has commented that [...] "unlike Friends of the Earth, for example, which sprung fully formed from the forehead of David Brower, Greenpeace developed in a more evolutionary manner. There was no single founder". Greenpeace itself says on its web page that [...] "there's a joke that in any bar in Vancouver, Canada, you can <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> someone {{who claims to have}} founded Greenpeace. In fact, there was no single founder: name, idea, spirit and tactics can all be said to have separate lineages". Patrick Moore has said that [...] "the truth is that Greenpeace was always a work in progress, not something definitively founded like a country or a company. Therefore there are a few shades of gray about who might lay claim to being a founder of Greenpeace." [...] Early Greenpeace director Rex Weyler says on his homepage that the insiders of Greenpeace have debated about the founders since mid-1970s.|$|R
6000|$|Mary laughed. [...] "Tell you, sweet simple child? I wish Fan, {{that you}} could come here and <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> me {{for half an hour}} and read out a chapter from Alice in Wonderland, and then tell me what it all means. It was Sir Isaac Newton, I think, who said of poetry that it was a 'beautiful kind of nonsense'; at all events, if he did not say it he thought it, being a {{scientific}} man. And that is the best description I can give of Merton's talk. That's his merit, his one art, which he has cultivated and is proficient in. He reminds me of those street performers who swallow match-boxes and tie themselves up with fifty knots and then wriggle out of the rope, and keep a dozen plates, balls, and knives and forks all flying about at one time in the air. The mystery is how a woman like his wife--who is certainly clever, judging from the sketches I have read, and beautiful, as I have good reason to remember--should have thrown herself away on such a charlatan. Love is blind, they say, but I never imagined it to be quite so blind as that!" ...|$|R
40|$|William Vickrey's Agenda for Progressive {{taxation}} {{is perhaps}} his best-known work. It stands roughly half way between Edgeworth and Mirrlees, both historically and intellectually. Edgeworth {{argued that the}} optimal tax (and transfer) system equalized incomes by taxing above-average incomes at 100 percent and transferring the proceeds to those below average. Mirrlees argued optimality {{in the presence of}} disincentive effects, which Edgeworth ignored, placing severe limits on high tax rates. Vickrey proposed 21 tax reforms to make a practical system of personal progressive taxation workable. The two most famous were cumulative lifetime averaging and decreasing power succession taxes. paper reviews the proposals in light of subsequent intellectual and historical developments. Many of the issues Vickrey explored are relevant today whether the tax system is flat or progressive and whether the base is income or consumption. I am honored to be here today to present the Vickrey Lecture. Usually the honoree discusses his or her own research. However, for reasons that will become self-evident, I have decided to discuss Bill Vickrey's work on progressive taxation. I first met Bill Vickrey in 1971. 1 was attending the National Tax Association meetings in Kansas City to accept their first outstanding doctoral dissertation award. The day before that presentation, we attended a rodeo. Who should <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> me but Bill Vickrey...|$|R
50|$|We see our Stranger {{with his}} {{bandages}} off, carrying a camera around. He <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> {{a young girl}} at a Café, who recognizes him {{as the director of}} the film Anima State. Soon she is joined by any army of other youths, who begin beating him with their keyboards. The Stranger runs away and finds himself in crowd of people blocking the highway, protesting the corrupt government. However most of the people seem to be more interested in being on TV rather than actually changing anything.|$|E
5000|$|The legendary ending opens as Crackers, Cotton, and Divine {{walk down}} the street, where they spot a dog and its owner. They look at the dog excitedly and hungrily for some reason. Then the dog defecates on the sidewalk, and Divine <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> it. She takes the feces {{in her hand and}} puts them in her mouth, proving, as the narrator states, that she is [...] "not only the filthiest person in the world, but is also the world's filthiest actress". She gags twice and grins at the camera.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Ocean City the group gets drunk {{and goes to}} a party. After entering the party, Josh tells the boys [...] "the secret" [...] about female body language. Later at the party Ben talks to Megs (played by Laurel Reese), his best friend. As they talk, Annie enters the party. Her entrance completely distracts Ben. Ben then <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Annie and flirts with her. As Ben and Annie begin to kiss, Nickie gets into a fight, which causes Annie to leave and ends the party.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} written after a reunion {{of the two}} songwriters Cory Batten and Tiffany Goss after working {{together}} previously on the song [...] "Down by the River" [...] on the Brooks and Dunn album [...] "Hillbilly Deluxe". Batten told the website [...] "Taste of Country", [...] "We hadn’t really written together {{for about a year}} and a half after that, maybe. Tiffany and I have always been really close friends. We saw each other at a restaurant, and was like, ‘Hey! It’s like we never said goodbye, hanging out together!’ We were like, ‘There’s our next song right there!’" [...] He also said, [...] "The only hard part that I remember I remember about this song was where to take it if he did <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her. What would be the next logical thing that happens? How do you break that ice and start talking again? I knew I wanted it to have a snowball effect with the story. You see each other, and then this happens and this happens and this happens … like a snowball effect, where they’re together at the end. Like if I hadn’t of walked back in, then we would have never sat down to talk. If we hadn’t sat down to talk, we would never have had that glass of wine." [...] Batten also revealed, [...] "Clay told me after he heard it, he knew immediately that he wanted to cut it. He’s always told me that he’s been a big fan of the song, and he was instrumental in making sure that it was going to be a single. He said he believed in it as much as any song that he has ever recorded." ...|$|R

5000|$|It {{begins with}} Puth playing Rachmaninoff's [...] "Morceaux de fantaisie, Op. 3, Prelude No. 2 in C-sharp minor" [...] {{on a grand}} piano in a college music classroom, before he's {{interrupted}} by a girl (played by Ellie Hahn) who {{comes into the room}} to watch, before she puts on headphones, and the actual song begins. It then cuts to clips of him walking to and sitting down in class. He nudges his friend as he sees the girl sit down behind him, still wearing her headphones. He looks back at her and she smiles, but her boyfriend then <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her, which Puth sees, and then sinks down into his chair.|$|E
5000|$|At the competition, Babe {{meets the}} sheep {{that he will}} be herding, but they ignore his {{attempts}} to speak to them. As Hoggett is criticized by the bemused judges and ridiculed by the public for using a pig instead of a dog, Rex runs back to the farm to ask the sheep what to do. They give him a secret password, first extracting a promise that he will treat them better from now on. He returns in time to convey the password to Babe, and the sheep now follow his instructions flawlessly. Amid the crowd’s acclamation, he is unanimously given the highest score. While he <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the farmer, Hoggett praises him by saying, [...] "That'll do, Pig. That'll do." ...|$|E
50|$|As {{they close}} the case, Olivia {{contacts}} Emily {{to pass on}} thanks, but gets Jim instead. Jim finds Emily missing from her bedroom, and the Fringe team sets off to follow a black van that Jim had spotted believing Emily was kidnapped; it turns out this was only a dry cleaning delivery van. Olivia quickly realizes where Emily has gone and directs Jim to meet her at the park bench by the lake. Emily is there in the bitter cold, and Jim <b>sits</b> <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her coaxing her to get help, but she refuses. Olivia spots Emily's most recent drawing, of her and her father on the bench with her watching, and realizes that Emily is dying. Jim holds onto Emily as she dies from an overload of electrical activity in her brain caused by her ability.|$|E

60|$|MARTELLUS. Friends: it {{is unfortunate}} that Pygmalion is constitutionally {{incapable}} of exhibiting anything without first giving a lecture about it to explain it; but I promise you that if you will be patient he will shew you the two most wonderful works of art in the world, and that they will contain some of my own very best workmanship. Let me add that they will inspire a loathing that will cure you of the lunacy of art for ever.
