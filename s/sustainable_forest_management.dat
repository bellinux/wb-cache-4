The purpose {{of this research was}} to find out opportunities and options to develop <b>sustainable</b> community <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> at the biosphere reserve of Luki. The research was conducted in the biosphere reserve of Luki located in the southwest of DR- Congo. The human activities threat the biosphere reserve of Luki to be under significant pressure of unsustainable management. The research revealed a number of options and opportunities to establish <b>sustainable</b> community <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> and policies needed to sustain forest ecosystem in the biosphere of Luki. The research uses a qualitative research methods, both primary and secondary data were collected during field work in 2010 through interviews and other various participatory methods. The interviewee includes different local forestry authorities and local community. The results of the research showed that, <b>sustainable</b> community <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> cannot be established in an environment where no effective policy instruments or law enforcement being in place. The results show that, due to political conditions in DR- Congo, the government {{has not been able to}} put certain measure to resolve tenure rights. This has remained a difficult issue and challenge that the government has not been able to find an immediate solution. The research recommends the need to develop a <b>sustainable</b> community <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> at the biosphere reserve of Luki. The government needs to clarify the forest code by clearly stating what government wants to do with its vast forest resources, especially in regard to the forest dependent people. A policy framework should be put in place as soon as possible in order for forest institutions to be able to function. The management strategy should be an inclusive process in order to promote equity and multiple use of forest resource at local community level...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sustainable</b> urban <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> is {{important}} to sustain the myriad values associated with urban trees. These values are threatened by the advent of climate change. Urban forests responses to this change should be framed appropriately in our interpretation of urban forest sustainability and its management. While the usual approach to address climate change in the urban forest setting has concentrated in climate mitigation, chiefly greenhouse gas emission reduction, much is to be desired about climate adaptation. It is argued here that any <b>sustainable</b> urban <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> framework fails to address the deep implications of urban forest sustainability {{if it does not}} address the climate question. This paper demonstrates that climate mitigation and adaptation can be integrated in a <b>sustainable</b> urban <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> framework that is inclusive of climate considerations and strives to sustain a strong array of environmental, social and economic values. It is shown here that such a framework may contain management practices that consider the net effect of both decreasing vulnerability and emissions. In the biophysical realm, these practices may include, but are not limited to: planting more trees, planting better adapted species to the future climate, reducing tree stress, among others. Management practices fit to the social and economic realm may include addressing institutions, ownership and valuation of ecosystem services, among others...|$|R

40|$|The {{state owned}} company, PT. Inhutani II Sub Unit Malinau, has managed the lowland dipterocarps forest in Malinau District, East Kalimantan for over 10 years. They {{established}} {{permanent sample plots}} (PSP) for measuring the growth and the yield in their area. However, current regulations do not give the company a sufficient space to use the PSP data for managing the area, nor a systematic way to involve the communities in the <b>management</b> of the <b>forest.</b> This research was aimed to seek scenarios of <b>sustainable</b> secondary <b>forest</b> <b>management.</b> The scenarios were developed through simulation of social and biophysical components in the area using Multi-Agent System (MAS). MAS is a branch of artificial intelligent for creating artificial society used for social simulation. This paper presents scenarios' development process and scenarios of collaborative <b>management</b> of the <b>forest.</b> The results reveal that Multi-Agent System (MAS) is a powerful tool in simulating and in developing scenarios of <b>sustainable</b> dipterocarps <b>forest</b> <b>management.</b> the sustainability was measured by indicators of forest cover and standing stock, carbon stock, communities incomes, the company revenue and taxes paid to the local and center governments.

40|$|Much {{research}} {{in recent years}} has analyzed the ecosystem service aspect of forests, while highlighting the need for <b>sustainable</b> <b>forests.</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>management</b> mechanisms at an inter-institutional level in Japan have been identified to hinder the implementation of <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> that is focused on the equal production of ecosystem services. This study presents an institutional analysis of unsustainability risk causality in a private industrial forest in Kochi Prefecture, Japan, from an ecosystem perspective incorporating common ecosystem service hazards that affect the sustainability functions of forests. This was performed with the aim to offer a basis for a less complicated analysis of ecosystem service hazards in industrial forests and to provide causal clarity at different institution levels. It was found that due to Japan’s systematic top-down <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> approach with the law at the top, vertical relationships cause direct and indirect negative horizontal relationships at each institutional level. To mitigate vertical and horizontal effects, institutional adaptions must be performed to address a combination of satisfier and hygiene factors. Under current conditions of non-enforceable forest policy, objectives and decisions regarding policy and management instruments at the national level must be integrated. This requires effective and adaptive multi-level institutional governance...|$|R

40|$|Much of {{mainland}} Southeast Asia's {{primary forest}} {{has been converted}} into secondary vegetation types {{in the past several}} decades. In the Lower Mekong Subregion, nearly 100 million ha of forest were significantly altered or removed, with depletion in terms of areal percent most severe in Thailand and Vietnam. Timber extraction and conversion of forestland to agriculture are the two principal causes of forest degradation in the region. Logged sites are often later occupied by migrant homesteaders. The current regional focus of logging has shifted to Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar. Secondary forests, despite their frequently degraded status, continue to play direct and supportive roles with respect to socioeconomic development. Widespread removal of primary forests has made secondary forests the principal source of supplemental livelihood products for millions of poor rural households. Given the critical role of <b>forests</b> in supporting <b>sustainable</b> development, regional governments and a range of non government, research and donor organisations are exploring, developing and supporting strategies for reforestation and natural forest regeneration.
