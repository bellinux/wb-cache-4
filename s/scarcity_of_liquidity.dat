40|$|Bailout {{policy is}} time-inconsistent, {{which results in}} {{multiple}} equilibria characterized by too much leverage, high risk correlation and little liquidity holding. I show that a long-run horizon allows the policy-maker to define bailout plans that rule out the worse equilibria. This result contrasts with the standard finding in environments with a unique equilibrium, as in most applications, in which a long-run horizon allows the policy-maker to support superior outcomes in equilibrium. I use this framework to discuss the effectiveness of three prudential policy proposals: too-big-to-fail size caps, taxes on borrowing and liquidity requirements. I also argue that policies alleviating the time-inconsistency of bailouts may generate large welfare gains. In this regard, I discuss three alternatives: policies against the <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> during crises, bailout design, and public debt. ...|$|E
40|$|We study {{endogenous}} {{currency substitution}} in a decentralized trade environment. Sellers maximize profits from sales of imperfectly substitutable goods by posting prices in {{either one of}} two currencies. A unique symmetric equilibrium exists where goods are priced only in the local currency. This occurs if foreign trade is sporadic, there is sufficient but not excessive liquidity, and discounting is low. Excess or <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> however, induces sellers to extract all surplus from buyers. This destroys the monetary equilibrium and shuts down trade. Equilibria with and without currency substitution coexist on some redion of the parameter space, and may be multiple. We prove that purchasing power parity may hold even if foreign trade is costly and the currency 2 ̆ 7 s value differs across countries.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{collateral}} provision as a potential channel between funding liquidity tensions and the <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> market <b>liquidity.</b> This channel consists in transferring the credit risk associated with refinancing operations between financial institutions to market participants that bear new liquidity risk on the market associated with collateral. In particular, we address the issue <b>of</b> the <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> the French government debt securities market, since these assets are used as collateral both in the open market operations of the ECB and on the interbank market. We use a time-varying transition probability (TVTP) VAR model considering both the monetary policy cycle and the cycle of French treasury auctions. We highlight the existence of a specific regime in which monetary policy neutrality is not verified on the market for French bonds. Moreover, the existence of conventional and unconventional regimes leads to asymmetries in monetary policy implementation.

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} three essays analyzing {{the role of}} fiat money in decentralized trade. Essay 1 develops a model that describes a two-country-two-currency economy, in which prices are endogenized by using the “split-the-surplus” rule. The government generates seignorage revenue by issuing money to newborn citizen in return for goods. This process induces inflation and agents start using the foreign currency as a hedge against inflation on their own currency. This framework offers the possibility to analyze the main determinants of currency substitution and its implications on welfare and seignorage revenues. ^ Essay 2 also studies endogenous currency substitution and price formation in a general equilibrium model with bilateral and decentralized international trade. In contrast to essay 1, {{there is a lack}} of government and prices are more realistically determined. In particular, sellers of homogenous goods choose to post prices in either of two currencies given that buyers 2 ̆ 7 valuation is unobservable. It is shown that the absence of well-integrated international goods markets does not necessarily imply a violation of the law of one price. In equilibrium goods may be priced only in the local currency, but <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> local <b>liquidity</b> supports equilibria with currency substitution where the law of one price holds. By fostering trade, international circulation of money may enhance welfare. ^ Finally, essay 3 analyses the relation between welfare and the taxation of money in a search-theoretic framework with flexible prices. In a model, closely related to that by Li (1995), prices are endogenously determined in the two most commonly used ways. First, buyers make take-it-or-leave-it offers to sellers. Second, using the price formation developed in essay 2, sellers post prices for their goods. In this decentralized trading environment buyers must exert effort to meet buyers, which gives rise to a trading externality. In contrast to Li 2 ̆ 7 s result with fixed prices, the externality cannot be internalized by taxing money holdings since prices are free to adjust to this additional trading friction. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} true spreads is {{developed}} using spread {{data from the}} Australian Stock Exchange. This spread model separates the true or intrinsic spread of a stock from the component of spread that is due to tick size. This enables the identification of excessive market spreads due to a large minimum tick size (large minimum price increment). The true or uncensored spreads are modelled as a LogNormal dis-tribution where the scale (mean) parameter of the distribution {{is a function of}} stock Turnover and Volatility, stock Price is not a deter-minant of true spreads. This is a powerful and intuitive result; true spread {{is a measure of the}} true cost of liquidity and this cost is a func-tion of the <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> (Turnover) and the risk of supplying liquidity (Volatility), nominal stock price is irrelevant to the cost of market liquidity.

Significant differences in the value <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> for bonds, as opposed to the value <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> for stocks, are discovered.

40|$|The pricing <b>of</b> total <b>liquidity</b> risk is {{studied in}} the {{cross-section}} of stock returns. The study {{suggests that there is}} a positive relation between total volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> and expected returns. Our measure <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> is based on Amihud (2002) and its volatility is measured using daily data. Furthermore, we document that total volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> is priced in the presence <b>of</b> systematic <b>liquidity</b> risk: the covariance of stock returns with aggregate <b>liquidity,</b> the covariance <b>of</b> stock <b>liquidity</b> with aggregate liquidity, and the covariance <b>of</b> stock <b>liquidity</b> with the market return. The separate pricing of total volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> indicates that idiosyncratic liquidity risk is important in the cross section of returns. This result is puzzling in light of Acharya and Pedersen (2005) who develop a model in which only systematic liquidity risk affects returns. The positive correlation between the volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> and expected returns suggests that risk averse investors require a risk premium for holding stocks that have high variation in liquidity. Higher variation in liquidity implies that a stock may become illiquid with higher probability {{at a time when it}} is traded. This is important for investors who face an immediate liquidity need and are not able to wait for periods <b>of</b> high <b>liquidity</b> to sell...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} pricing <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> risks in London Stock Exchange. Liquidity Adjusted Capital Asset Pricing Model i. e.

The Liquidity Adjusted Capital Asset Pricing model provides a unified framework for the testing <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> risks.

40|$|The present {{article focuses}} on the {{internal}} factors which have potential infl uence on the <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> the Slovenian banking sector. Unlike other studies, this paper uses multiple dependent variables, encompassing different views on liquidity and leading to higher complexity. These include the creation <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> its outfl ow, net change and total reallocation, determined {{on the basis of}} a specifi c method <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> measurement – the gross liquidity fl ows. The chosen independent variables include various items of internal character such as loans, deposits, profi t, capital and the size of the bank. Robust regression analyses are performed. The results indicate that internal factors have the greatest infl uence on the creation <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> where almost all the variables considered were signifi cant. Used factors do not only affect liquidity creation, often investigated by authors, but affect other dimensions <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> as well. A signifi cant item which played a role in multiple dimensions <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> was the value of loans and the size of the bank (total assets). The models have shown that any given factor only has an infl uence on the creation <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> without infl uencing its outfl ow and vice versa. Thus, when looking for determinants only for the creation or only for the outfl ow <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> the results need not necessarily comprehensively show the infl uence of the given factors, and can lead to erroneous conclusions. It is therefore suitable to include multiple views on the value <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> since the infl uence of a factor can be more dominant in a different dimension <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> and affect the fi nal value...|$|R
