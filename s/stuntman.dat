5|$|Filming {{took place}} in the Czech Republic. A <b>stuntman</b> died in an {{accident}} during the first weeks of filming. Besson was said to have become completely uncommunicative after the incident, only appearing on set to shout orders at people.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012 {{the family}} of Kun Liu (the <b>stuntman</b> killed during filming) filed a {{wrongful}} death suit against the producers of the film, Nu Image and Millennium Films, and stunt coordinator Chad Stahelski. The suit alleged that conditions for the stunt were unsafe. The Expendables 2 credits contain a dedication to Liu's memory.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} over 14 weeks (beginning in September 2011) on an estimated $100million budget. Film locations included Bulgaria, Hong Kong and New Orleans.

50|$|This {{documentary}} from Robin Shou—who also {{hosts and}} {{participates in the}} film—takes a behind-the-scenes glance inside the stunt industry of Hong Kong, which is known for being riskier and less trick-oriented than its American counterpart. In addition to archival and interview footage featuring some of the industry's most prominent <b>stuntmen,</b> Red Trousers - The Life of Hong Kong <b>Stuntmen</b> incorporates scenes from adventure short action film Lost Time (2001) {{in an effort to}} illustrate how <b>stuntmen</b> prepare for and ultimately perform in modern martial arts films.|$|R
5|$|The {{motorcycle}} sidecar missile used in one chase sequence {{was built}} by film staff at Pinewood and used a standard Kawasaki Z900 and a custom made sidecar outfit. The sidecar was made large enough so that a <b>stuntman</b> could lie flat inside. It had two 10 inch scooter wheels on each side, a Suzuki 185 engine and the detached projectile was steered through a small solid rubber wheel at the front. A heavily smoked perspex nose allowed the <b>stuntman</b> sufficient visibility to steer the device whilst being entirely hidden from view. A pincer type lock held the sidecar in place until operated by the pilot via a solenoid switch. The sequences involving the outfit were speeded up as {{the weight of the}} sidecar made the outfit very difficult to control.|$|E
5|$|A scientist, engineer, billionaire, {{founder and}} owner of Oscorp, who tests an {{unstable}} strength enhancer on himself and becomes the insane and powerful demon. Unaware of Spider-Man's true identity, he also {{sees himself as a}} father figure for Peter, ignoring his own son, Harry. Dafoe was cast as Osborn in November 2000, after Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, and John Travolta turned down the role. Dafoe insisted on wearing the uncomfortable costume as he felt that a <b>stuntman</b> would not convey the character's necessary body language. The 580-piece suit took half an hour to put on.|$|E
5|$|By May 3, 1986, {{production}} {{had moved}} to New Orleans. In the town of Thibodaux, Louisiana, Parker and his crew discovered a plantation village that {{would serve as a}} graveyard. An unused Louisiana field was used to create a racetrack where Angel meets the wealthy patriarch Ethan Krusemark (Fontelieu). On May 13, the crew encountered some difficulty filming a chase scene involving Angel, as they had to deal with shying horses, trained dogs, gunshots, two hundred chickens, and a horse specially trained to fall on top of Rourke's <b>stuntman.</b>|$|E

5|$|Several urban legends exist {{regarding}} the chariot sequence. One claims that a <b>stuntman</b> died during filming, which Nosher Powell claims in his autobiography, and another states that a red Ferrari {{can be seen}} during the chariot race. The book Movie Mistakes claims this is a myth. Heston, in a DVD commentary track for the film, mentions that a third urban legend claims that he wore a wristwatch during the chariot race, but points out that he wore leather bracers up to the elbow.|$|E
5|$|The trailer {{featured}} Shatner {{using some}} classic Kirk fighting moves, including a judo chop and an ear clap, {{and in a}} homage to the original it had the Gorn throw couch cushions rather than the polystyrene rocks in the original episode.

5|$|When Refn {{read the}} first {{screenplay}} for Drive, he was more intrigued by {{the concept of a}} man having a split personality, being a <b>stuntman</b> by day and a getaway driver at night, than the story itself. Believing that the director might be intimidated by the script as it was unlike anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about Refn's desire to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.|$|E
5|$|For the 2009 remake, <b>stuntman</b> Derek Mears {{was hired}} to portray Jason Voorhees at the {{recommendation}} of makeup special effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Mears's pleasant demeanor had the studio worried {{about his ability to}} portray such a menacing character on screen, but Mears assured them {{he would be able to}} perform the role. When Mears auditioned for the role he was asked why they should hire an actor over just another guy in a mask. As Mears explained, portraying Jason is similar to Greek mask work, where the mask and the actor are two separate entities, and, based on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance.|$|E
5|$|In September, {{production}} {{moved to}} Egypt. While the Great Sphinx of Giza was {{shot on the}} location, lighting problems caused the pyramids to be replaced with miniatures. While construction of the Liparus set continued, the second unit headed by John Glen departed for Mount Asgard, where in July 1976 they staged the film's pre-credits sequence. Bond film veteran Willy Bogner captured the action, staged by <b>stuntman</b> Rick Sylvester, who earned $30,000 for the stunt. This stunt cost $500,000 – the most expensive single movie stunt at that time. Additional scenes for the pre-credits sequence were filmed in the Bernina Range in the Swiss alps.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} April 25, 2011, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with the working title Group Hug. In June 2011, <b>stuntman</b> Jeremy Fitzgerald injured his head while attempting a stunt involving a 30-foot fall from a building after {{getting hit by}} an arrow. A Marvel spokesperson later told TMZ.com that despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set. The following month, secondary filming took place about an hour outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the Butler area. A chase sequence was also shot in Worthington, Pennsylvania at Creekside Mushroom Farms, the world's largest single-site mushroom farm, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming.|$|E
5|$|After {{they started}} to break apart, further orders were placed for {{additional}} suits and all the suits used eventually fell apart during the four days they were used on set. In order to film one scene, McChesney wore the suit open-backed due to the damage. No optical effects were used in creating Armus. For the scene where Riker is pulled into the oil, a <b>stuntman</b> {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, it was actually a plaster cast of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same grate used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The twitching effect in Yar's death was due to a wire tied around Crosby's waist being pulled on.|$|E
5|$|At the Rio de Janeiro location, {{many months}} later, Roger Moore arrived {{several days later}} than {{scheduled}} for shooting due to recurrent health problems and an attack of kidney stones that he had suffered while in France. After arriving in Rio de Janeiro, Moore was immediately whisked off the plane and went straight to hair and make-up work, before re-boarding the plane, to film the sequence with him arriving as James Bond in the film. Sugarloaf Mountain was a prominent location in the film, and during filming of the cable car sequence in which Bond and Goodhead are attacked by Jaws during mid-air transportation high above Rio de Janeiro, the <b>stuntman</b> Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death. For the scene in which Jaws bites into the steel tramway cable with his teeth, the cable was actually made of liquorice, although Richard Kiel was still required to use his steel dentures.|$|E

50|$|After {{two years}} at Channel 9 Trenchard Smith formed his own {{production}} company, borrowed $16,000 and made a one-hour television special about <b>stuntmen</b> called The <b>Stuntmen</b> featuring Grant Page. This was a success and enabled {{him to make a}} number other TV specials, usually with a theme of action and/or danger. Kung Fu Killers, which also featured Page, was particularly successful. Throughout this decade Trenchard-Smith also worked cutting trailers.|$|R
50|$|He portrayed Slick Dmitry in Hardcore Henry, {{and was one}} of {{the many}} <b>stuntmen</b> who played the title character.|$|R
5|$|For {{the climactic}} tanker chase, the {{producers}} used an entire {{section of a}} highway near Mexicali, which had been closed for safety reasons. Sixteen eighteen-wheeler tankers were used, some with modifications made by manufacturer Kenworth {{at the request of}} driving stunts arranger Rémy Julienne. Most were given improvements to their engines to run faster, while one model had an extra steering wheel {{on the back of the}} cabin so a hidden <b>stuntman</b> could drive while Carey Lowell was in the front and another received extra suspension on its back so it could lift its front wheels. Although a rig was constructed to help a rig tilt onto its side, it was not necessary as Julienne was able to pull off the stunt without the aid of camera trickery.|$|E
5|$|Spottiswoode {{tried to}} {{innovate}} {{in the action}} scenes. Since the director felt that after the tank chase in GoldenEye he could not use a bigger vehicle, a scene with Bond and Wai Lin on a BMW motorcycle was created. Another innovation was the remote-controlled car, which had no visible driver – an effect achieved by adapting a BMW 750i to put the steering wheel on the back seat. The car chase sequence with the 750i took three weeks to film, with Brent Cross car park being used to simulate Hamburg – although the final leap was filmed on location. A stunt involving setting fire to three vehicles produced more smoke than anticipated, causing {{a member of the}} public to call the fire brigade. The upwards camera angle filming the HALO jump created the illusion of having the <b>stuntman</b> opening its parachute close to the water.|$|E
5|$|The pre-credits {{sequence}} used {{a church}} in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while the helicopter scenes were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London. The gas works were also the location for some of Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film, Full Metal Jacket. Director John Glen {{got the idea for}} the remote-controlled helicopter after seeing a child playing with an RC car. Since flying a helicopter through a warehouse was thought to be too dangerous, the scene was shot using forced perspective. A smaller mock-up was built by Derek Meddings' team closer to the camera that the stunt pilot Marc Wolff flew behind and this made it seem as if the helicopter was entering the warehouse. The footage inside the building was shot on location, though with a life-sized helicopter model which stood over a rail. <b>Stuntman</b> Martin Grace stood as Bond when the agent is dangling outside the flying helicopter, while Roger Moore himself was used in the scenes inside the model.|$|E

5000|$|On 6 November 2016, while {{filming the}} climax fight scene for the {{upcoming}} Masti Gudi film, two <b>stuntmen</b> playing villainous roles: Anil and Uday along with Vijay jumped into the Thippagondanahalli reservoir from a helicopter. While the two <b>stuntmen</b> drowned, Vijay was rescued by the film crew. [...] Following this incident, the Karnataka Film Commerce Chamber (KFCC) imposed a ban on Vijay, director Nagashekar and stunt choreographer Ravi Varma until further notice.|$|R
