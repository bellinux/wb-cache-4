50|$|The {{genesis of}} the idea of vapour quality was derived from the origins of thermodynamics, where an {{important}} application was the <b>steam</b> engine.

The quality of <b>steam</b> can be quantitatively described by <b>steam</b> quality (<b>steam</b> dryness), the proportion of saturated <b>steam</b> in a saturated water/steam mixture. I.e., a <b>steam</b> quality of 0 indicates 100% water while a <b>steam</b> quality of 1 (or 100%) indicates 100% <b>steam.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractWhen {{the unit}} is under normal operating, the <b>steam</b> source of plant-steam is from the fourth <b>steam</b> {{extraction}} of turbine.

In this paper, {{in order to improve}} the economy when the turbine is operating under the low load, reheat cold section <b>steam</b> is used as high-pressure <b>steam</b> to extract the fourth <b>steam</b> by the <b>steam</b> technology, which turns the low-pressure <b>steam</b> into the medium-pressure <b>steam</b> for recycling.

50|$|A <b>steam</b> {{generator}} iron is {{a modified}} version of a standard <b>steam</b> iron. Like traditional <b>steam</b> irons, <b>steam</b> generator irons use a combination of heat and <b>steam</b> power to remove wrinkles while ironing, they usually have a water reservoir either fully attached or detachable and a boiler that converts the water into <b>steam.</b> A high volume of pressurised <b>steam</b> can be released either continuously or in burst mode. The main difference between a <b>steam</b> generator iron and a regular <b>steam</b> iron is the amount of <b>steam</b> they produce.|$|R
50|$|Superheaters heat {{saturated}} <b>steam</b> to {{a temperature}} above saturation point to ensure dry <b>steam</b> is being produced.

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>steam</b> {{generator}} irons, pressurised and non-pressurised. A non-pressurised <b>steam</b> generator iron will produce a lot of <b>steam</b> but the <b>steam</b> is released at a lower speed, typically around 80-100 grams per minute. A pressurised <b>steam</b> generator iron, on the other hand, creates a highly pressurised environment that helps the <b>steam</b> penetrate fabric more efficiently. A pressurised <b>steam</b> generator iron will typically have a <b>steam</b> output of 100-120 grams per minute. The amount of pressure a <b>steam</b> generator iron has is measured in bars, with a higher bar number meaning the <b>steam</b> has more pressure. <b>Steam</b> generator irons typically have 3-6 bars of pressure.|$|R

40|$|<b>Steam</b> is an {{essential}} medium used in the industrial process. To ensure <b>steam</b> quality, small and middle scale boilers are often adopted. However, because a higher <b>steam</b> pressure (compared to the necessary <b>steam</b> pressure) is generated, the boiler’s <b>steam</b> pressure will be reduced via a pressure regulator before the <b>steam</b> is directed through the process. Unfortunately, pressure is somewhat wasted during the reducing process. Therefore, {{in order to promote}} energy efficiency, a pressure regulator is replaced by a <b>steam</b> expander. With this <b>steam</b> expander, the pressure will be transformed into mechanical energy and extracted during the expansion process. A new type of isothermal <b>steam</b> expander for an industrial <b>steam</b> supplying system will be presented in the paper. The isothermal <b>steam</b> expander will improve the energy efficiency of a traditional <b>steam</b> expander by replacing the isentropic process with an isothermal expansion process.
