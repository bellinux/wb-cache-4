40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to develop suitable machines for no-till sowing of sunflower and to evaluate the efficacy of different cultural practices in different sowing systems. During two-year trials a conventional sunflower sowing system, based on ploughing followed by some <b>secondary</b> soil <b>tillage</b> practices, was compared with a no-till sowing technique performed with a precision no-till planter developed and set up by the MAMA Division of DAGA at the University of Pisa. The efficacy of hoeing in combination with the two sowing systems was also evaluated. The no-till sowing technique performed with the no-till planter allowed a substantial saving on working times and fuel consumption as compared to the conventional system. In the first trial year productions were low in both systems and differences among treatments were not obtained, due to unfavorable climatic conditions that compromised crop development. But in the second trial year, productions were decidedly higher, the best results being achieved by adopting the no-till technique combined with hoeing. Use of the no-till planter allowed a substantial reduction in energy input and the no-till technique combined with hoeing gave the best energy productivity...|$|R
40|$|A wheat {{stubble field}} (clay-loam, light alkali; light salty and poor of organic matter) was {{established}} to carry out an experiment at Gökhöyük Agricultural Institute, Turkey. Effects of three different tillage systems: conventional tillage, reduced tillage and no-tillage on penetration resistance, emergence time, shooting degree and yield were investigated. Conventional tillage used a moldboard plough for primary tilling and a combined spring tine cultivator-spike tooth harrow for consecutive <b>secondary</b> tilling. Reduced <b>tillage</b> included only a cultivator-tooth harrow combination. No-tillage was accomplished by a direct (stubble) drill. Although the earliest emergence time (17 day) and the highest emergence degree (66. 5 %) were obtained, yield was the lowest in no-tillage system. The highest penetration resistance (53. 71 kg cm - 2) was measured in no-tillage system. Reduced and no tillage systems could be proposed for Gökhöyük region if alternative solutions is found to prevent soil compaction and reduce mechanical impedance in root growth zone.

40|$|A {{three year}} field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the role of soil inversion, cover crops and spring tillage methods for Palmer amaranth between-row (BR) and within-row (WR) management in glufosinate-resistant cotton. Main plots were two soil inversion treatments: fall inversion tillage (IT) and non-inversion tillage (NIT). Subplots were three cover treatments: crimson clover, cereal rye or none (i. e., winter fallow); and the sub subplots were four <b>secondary</b> spring <b>tillage</b> methods: disking followed by (fb) cultivator (DCU), disking fb chisel plow (DCH), disking fb disking (DD) and no tillage (NT). Averaged over years and soil inversion, the crimson clover produced maximum cover biomass (4390 kg ha&# 8722; 1) fb cereal rye (3698 kg ha&# 8722; 1) and winter fallow (777 kg ha&# 8722; 1). Two weeks after planting (WAP) and before the postemergence (POST) application, Palmer amaranth WR and BR density were two- and four-times less, respectively, in IT than NIT. Further, Palmer amaranth WR and BR density were reduced two-fold following crimson clover and cereal rye than following winter fallow at 2 WAP. Without IT, early season Palmer amaranth densities were 40 % less following DCU, DCH and DD, when compared with IT. Following IT, no spring tillage method improved Palmer amaranth control. The timely application of glufosinate + S-metolachlor POST tank mixture greatly improved Palmer amaranth control in both IT and NIT systems. The highest cotton yields were obtained with DD following cereal rye (2251 kg ha&# 8722; 1), DD following crimson clover (2213 kg ha&# 8722; 1) and DD following winter fallow (2153 kg ha&# 8722; 1). On average, IT cotton yields (2133 kg ha&# 8722; 1) were 21 % higher than NIT (1766 kg ha&# 8722; 1). Therefore, from an integrated weed management standpoint, an occasional fall IT could greatly reduce Palmer amaranth emergence on farms highly infested with glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth. In addition, a cereal rye or crimson clover cover crop can effectively reduce early season Palmer amaranth emergence in both IT and NIT systems. For effective and season-long control of Palmer amaranth, one or more POST applications of glufosinate + residual herbicide as tank mixture may be needed in a glufosinate-based cotton production system...|$|R

40|$|Forest {{seed bank}} {{assessments}} are scarce in Madagascar and thus {{little is known}} about the relationships between the seed banks and vegetation dynamics on which secondary succession processes rely. The objective of this paper is to analyse the effects of slash-and-burn agriculture on soil seed banks and their dynamics along secondary forest successions. The aim of this work is to determine the effects of agricultural practices (cropping duration, tillage regime and fallow age) on seed bank density (SBD) and diversity (SBSR) during secondary succession periods (< 25 years). Cropping duration was divided into three classes: (i) short (1 - 2 years), (ii) medium (3 - 5 years) and (iii) long (6 - 11 years). Tillage regime during crop successions was divided into three categories: (1) no tillage (only direct sowing is observed), (2) light tillage (after direct sowing, local shallow tillage is observed) and (3) heavy tillage (after direct sowing followed by light tillage practice, complete tillage practice is observed). Fifteen fallows subdivided into three regrowth age classes (2 - 6, 10 - 12 and 14 - 22 years) were surveyed. Fallow age is the main driver of SBD and SBSR: they increase with fallow age, regardless of cropping duration and tillage regime. SBD and SBSR recovery always occurs but is slower under long cropping duration (3 - 11 years) and heavy tillage regime because cropping duration helps to maintain a high level of wind-dispersed seeds during <b>secondary</b> succession and <b>tillage</b> regime contributes to reducing the proportion of viable seeds.

40|$|Ethiopian {{farmers have}} been using an ox-drawn {{breaking}} plough, known as ard plough - maresha, for thousands of years. Maresha is a pointed, steel-tipped tine attached to a draught pole at an adjustable shallow angle. It has narrow side-wings, attached {{to the left and}} right side of it, to push soil to either side without inverting. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the effect of side-wings on draught using a field soil bin test facility. To this end, a mobile and an in-situ soil bin test system, for online measurements of draught, was designed and developed. This research considered tool geometry (maresha plough with and without side-wings) and rake angle (shallow - 8 °, medium deep - 15 °, and deep - 24 °, representing primary, <b>secondary</b> and tertiary <b>tillage</b> processes in Ethiopia, respectively). Maresha plough with side-wings has greater contact area, between the moving soil and tool, than its wingless counterpart. When the ploughshare surface and soil slide relative to one another, the draught expected to increase with contact area, as adhesion and friction resistance increases with area. However, experimental analysis indicated that the maresha with side-wings required less draught compared to maresha without side-wings (ρ < 0. 001). This might be attributed to the effect of side-wings on crack propagation by a wedging effect to enhance and facilitate subsequent ploughing. This paper also dealt with the effect of rake angle on draught. Though the depth setup was getting smaller d 1 < d 2 < d 3 for the successive tillage runs, analysis showed increment in draught force (ρ < 0. 001) with rake angle. This might be attributed to higher soil compaction that comes with depth and downward force resulting from repeated use of maresha every season to the same depth for thousand years. Although more and rigorous studies should be undertaken considering soil, tool, and operational parameters to arrive at conclusive results, this paper gave some insights regarding effect of side-wings on maresha plough and rake angle on draught. This shows that there is still room for improvement of maresha plough geometry for minimum draught requirement and optimum soil manipulation...|$|R

The randomized block design with treatments arranged in split plot and arranged in four replications was used. The main treatments consisted of three cropping systems, conventional tillage, minimum tillage, and no <b>tillage.</b> <b>Secondary</b> treatments consisted of two choices of green manure (sunnhemp and velvet bean) and a fallow plot. After 180 days of harvest of sugar cane was counted the number of weeds. m- 2 and determined the dry mass of shoots, calculating their phytosociological index. Among the management systems of soil, the no tillage system showed a suppressive effect of weeds, resulting in fewer plants, less dry mass of plants and less variety of species, suppressing species that are considered important in the culture of sugar cane. The minimum tillage method revealed intermediate results and conventional tillage was most affected by weeds. Among the green manure planted in succession to sugar cane, the velvet bean is highlighted, and shows suppressive effect of the most important weeds in fields planted with conventional soil tillage. = A renovação dos canaviais é importante para manter elevada a produtividade agrícola da cultura e é realizada em média após cinco cortes, com o objetivo de comparar o efeito residual das culturas de sucessão nos diferentes sistemas plantio sobre a ocorrência espontânea de plantas daninhas em área de reforma de cana crua, instalou-se o experimento sobre ARGISSOLO VERMELHO-AMARELO Eutroférrico, localizado no município de Novais-SP, em canavial colhido sem queima prévia nos últimos cinco cortes.

40|$|SUMMARY Agricultural {{implement}} draft requirements {{depend on}} forces necessary to compress, shear, displace, accelerate and sometimes pulverize soil. These forces depend on (a) implement operating parameters, (b) soil properties and (c) implement geometry (James et. al., 1996). Experimental and theoretical analyses techniques {{are essential to}} develop efficient tillage or soil cutting tools. Soil bin, an experimental system, is a generic term for a test facility for studying soil dynamics, specifically for soil-machine interaction research in agriculture (Mahadi, 2005). Considerable experimental analysis has been done using indoor soil bin test systems under controlled soil condition. However, the parameters resulting from controlled soil conditions will not meet the actual field soil conditions. Thus, {{the objective of this}} research is to design and install a portable in-situ soil bin test system, and to use this system for experimentation with six different ploughshare geometries. This will give information on how geommetry and working conditions affect draught and power requirements for soil manipulations under actual field soil conditions. In the experimental design it is foreseen that the experimentation will be undertaken at three plough planes i. e. surface, at 20 cm depth, and at 40 cm depth. At each plane, ploughing will be undertaken at three different angles of the ploughshare i. e. 80, 150, and 240 representing primary, <b>secondary,</b> and tertiary <b>tillage.</b> Following experimentation and the signal analysis,, multi linear and linear regression are to be performed tocorrelate draught force with soil physical and mechanical properties, tillage tool geometry, travel speed, tillage depth, tillage angle, and furrow profile. The soil physical and mechanical properties are: bulk density, moisture content, penetration resistance, clay content, and silt content. Deliverables: D 1 : Design and installation of in-situ portable Soil Bin Test System is documented D 2 : Values about Tillage Depth, Tillage Angle, Travel Speed, Furrow Profile of the three planes at three different angles of plough with replicas from three sites at wet and dry conditions are reported Milestone: M 1 : Effect of Moisture Content, Bulk Density, Tillage Depth, Tillage Angle, Travel Speed, Furrow Profile, Soil Compaction, Clay Content, and Silt Content on Draught Requirement is investigated. M 2 : Effect of tool geometry on draught and soil manipulation is investigated INTRODUCTION The term tillage embraces all operations of seedbed preparation that optimize soil and environmental conditions for seed germination, seedling establishment and crop growth (FAO, 1994). The primary objectives of tillage are seedbed preparation, provision of a good medium for plant roots, water infiltration and retention, erosion and weed control (FAO, 1993). Tillage modifies soil surface structure, total porosity, macro-porosity, pore continuity and pore size distribution and therefore has great influence on the hydrology of an agricultural catchments (Mwendera, 1992). A granular structure is desirable to allow rapid infiltration and good retention of rainfall to provide adequate moisture and air exchange capacity within the soil and to minimize resistance to root penetration (Kelemu, 2001). A good seedbed generally implies finer particles and greater firmness {{in the vicinity of the}} seeds. However, the mechanical manipulation of soil (Kaumbutho et al., 2004) should be done carefully and adequately; otherwise, it leads to extreme soil disturbance, which in turn results in deteriorative consequences. The new tillage systems and the need for improved energy efficiency of tillage operations do put an emphasis for optimizing tillage tool design. This can be done by two different techniques, namely by experiment and by theoretical analysis techniques (Plouffe et al., 1999 a & b; Mouazen and Neményi, 1998). These methodologies could significantly assist in optimizing the implement designs and operational conditions aiming at minimum draught requirement and best soil manipulation performance. Soil bin test system technique is a means of experimental verification essential to develop efficient tillage or soil cutting tools. The requirement of such efficient tillage technique is to consume less energy and provide a satisfactory soil condition for crop emergence and growth. The field experiment allows prototype verification with specialized instrumented equipment (McLaughlin et al., 1993). Various researchers studied the draught requirement with respect to different soil and tillage parameters (Gill and Vanden Berg, 1967; Eradat Oskoui et. al 1982; Ayers and Perumpral, 1982; Koolen and Kuipers, 1983; Kydd et al., 1984; Upadhyaya et al. 1984; Busscher and Sojka, 1987; Young et al. 1988; Mouazen and Ramon, 2002; Bernier et al., 1989; Erbach et al., 1992; Oni et al., 1992; Shirin et al., 1993; Evans et al., 1996; Fielke, 1996; McKyes and Maswaure, 1997; Onwualu and Watts, 1998; Al-Janobi and Al-Suhaibani, 1998; Mapfumo and Chanasyk, 1998; Unger and Jones, 1998; Manian et al., 2000; Shrestha et al., 2001; Gratton et al., 2003; McLaughlin and Campbell, 2004). Although several reports on the effects of draught on the performances of different tillage tools and implements are available in the literature, there is dearth of information on experimentation of maresha plough with soil bin test system. Hence, the aim of this research is thesis aims to: (i) review research attempts on animal drawn implements; and soil bin test systems, techniques, and applications; (ii) describe the development of a mobile in-situ soil bin testing device; (iii) report the observations and insights gained from the field experiments; (iv) investigate the effect of maresha plough geometry on draught requirement and soil loosening; and (v) lay platform for further research. To do this, the design and installation of a portable and in-situ soil bin test system allows for controlled experimentation under field conditions. 1. 1 Why portable and in-situ soil bin test system Indoor soil bins provide tremendous benefits to researchers. But there are limitations with indoor soil bin test systems i. e. Indoor soil bins are built under dimensional constraints. Indoor soil bins have a limit in maximum loads. Most indoor soil bins are in a closed confinement. Replicate measurements on indoor bins always occur on disturbed and artificially conditioned soil Indoor soil bin does not consider the existence of vegetation and crop residue that affect the actual performance which cannot be replicated in an indoor soil bin. MATERIALS AND METHODS The portable and in-situ soil bin test system is designed and implemented by integrating measurement system (sensors, and data acquisition system). Draught is to be measured using force sensors (load cells), and online measurement of tillage speed and tillage depth using encoders and LVDT. Using core samplers, soil samples will be taken from field at 2 m interval, and accordingly bulk density, moisture content, clay content, and silt content are to be determined in laboratory. Soil penetration mesaurements are also done at these locations. Experimental Design The experimental design of in-situ and portable soil bin test sytem will consider six geometries: maresha without wing, maresha with wing, tenkara kind, duck foot plough, two modified plough geometries (modified plough 1, modified plough 2). Experiments will be undertaken at three planes to gain information of effect of soil compaction layers: surface ploughing, ploughing at 20 cm depth, ploughing at 40 cm depth. At each plough plane, ploughing will be undertaken at three different angles of ploughing/attack i. e. 80, 150, and 240 for the respective geometries. The soil bin consists of a carriage on which the instruments and plough shares are mounted. The carriage itself moves on an adapted rail track. The rail has 20 m length, and at both ends 2 m length is excavated to 60 cm depth for the start and end of a test run. This yields 16 m effective ploughing length and accordingly the starting and ending of ploughing is defined. The online parameters to be measured are draft force, tillage depth, and speed. At 2 m interval, soil samples will be taken to determine bulk density and moisture content in the laboratory. Penetration resistance and furrow areas and shapes will be measured at same distance interval. Tests in the dry season allow for controlled moisture conditioning of the soil: the soil shall get wet using partition dams with water application of 100 lt/m 2, and to be covered with plastic for three days. Two experimental designs which will be applicable at three sites with different soil types are proposed and are under review. 2. 2 Design and establishment of portable and in-stiu Soil Bin Test System Design and construction of rail and carriage system: The portable soil bin test system is designed and the components are pair of rails having 20 m length, carriage, and treated wooden footings. For experimental purpose, three rows are established, and the schematic layout is presented below. Design of sensor attachments: Design of measurement system for portable soil bin test system is performed. The soil bin test system incorporates load cell attachments for surface, at 20 cm depth, and at 40 cm depth ploughings. The load cells are connected by a cable to a data logger; and data presentation is displayed by means of PC running data acquisition system and DasyLab software package. Analog to Digital conversion System: The computer-based instrument acquires data in a rather straightforward system. A load cell picks up the force deformation and this analog information is received by the data acquisition hardware and digitized. The digitized value is sent to the computer and received by the data acquisition software. The software then interprets the value, conditions, scales, and displays and stores the data. The data acquisition hardware is from IOtech and composed of DBK 43 A (8 -channel strain gage module), DagBook/ 2000 E (Ethernet 16 -bit, 200 -kHz data acquisition system; includes DaqView software), DBK 203 (Screw-terminal adapter board in rugged metal enclosure for DaqBoard/ 2000 series; P 1 /P 2 /P 3, analog and digital I/O expansion ports), DBK 34 A (uninterruptible Power Supply for DC powered systems), and CA- 37 - 3 T (expansion cable from DaqBook to DBK modules). A software program called DASYLab, windows-based graphical data acquisition software package, is usede for data acquisition. The DASYLab uses icon-based flowchart, the job of communicating with the hardware is taken care of by a driver. Data Analyses: After suitable filtering to remove measurement noise, the force and speed signals are available for analysis. Multi linear and linear regression are to be performed to correlate draught force with moisture content, bulk density, tillage depth, tillage angle, travel speed, penetration resistance, furrow profile, clay content, and silt content. 3 Ph. D. STATUS The doctoral research is based on experimentation using portable and in-situ soil bin test system, and instrumentation of two-wheel tractor. Literature review has been undertaken, and the in-situ and portable soil bin test system is designed and installed in Mekelle University, Ethiopia. Attachement which helps to plough at three planes i. e. surface, 20 cm depth, and 40 cm are designed, manufactured and tested. Experimentation was undertaken at three plough planes: surface, at 20 cm depth, and 40 cm depth; and at three different angle of plough. The respective depths are prepared by removing strip of 40 cm width soil so as to investigate the effect of hardpan on soil tillage. Soil samples were also taken at 2 m interval using core samplers to determine moisture content and bulk density. Preliminary data analyses were also undertaken. The progress of the work was presented on seminar held on Nov 17, 2010 at KU Leuven. The following points were raised: experimental design with randomization; changing the pulling rope with steel chain because of elasticity; and topography of the selected plot which need to be plain enough, and start of ploughing somehow from relatively bottom so that to avoid inertia effect of the carriage. Besides, instead of measuring tillage depth manually and caluclating speed as function of total distance travelled and time elapsed, it is recommended to incorprate encoder and LVDT so that to have online data measurement. With regard to wheel slip, two encoders recommended to be incorporated on the design, one to be attached at the drive wheel and the other one at the free wheel. In order to avoid noise on measurement, grounding the -ve of battery, and sheilding of all cables with aluminium foil and grounding to the same point was recommended; with this, data was taken and displayed data was seen with lesser noise. For further data measurement and signal analyses, it is recommended to design filter in order to avoid noise on measrement, and the process is on progress. Experimental design and daily basis work plan is submitted and it is on review. From Feb 2011 to Sep 2011, in Mekelle University - Ethiopia, the measurement system will be modified to incorporate the above mentioned recommendations and intensive data will be taken from three sites. Data analyses and interpretation will then follow from Oct 2011 up to Mar 2012 at KU Leuven. status: accepte...|$|R

Different types are used for preparation of fields before planting, and for the control of weeds between row crops.

40|$|If 2 ̆ 2 tillage 2 ̆ 2 {{is defined}} as the {{mechanical}} manipulation of soil, it follows, then, that a 2 ̆ 2 tillage system 2 ̆ 2 would be the sequence of soil-manipulation operations performed in producing a crop. Today, however, such a definition is recognized as inadequate. We know, for instance, that the management of non-harvested plant tissue (i. e., residue) affects both crop production and soil erosion, and that field operations in which the soil is not tilled have a marked influence on soil condition. Therefore, in this publication, a tillage system is the sequence of all operations involved in producing the crop, including soil manipulation, harvesting, chopping or shredding of residue, application of pesticides and fertilizers, etc. But before describing and comparing the various tillage systems for corn, some terminologies and possible points of confusion need to be addressed. These have to do with primary vs. <b>secondary</b> <b>tillage</b> and the different ways in which similar tillage systems could be defined. PRIMARY AND <b>SECONDARY</b> <b>TILLAGE</b> For many tillage systems, the specific operations can be separated into 2 ̆ 2 primary 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 secondary. 2 ̆ 2 Primary tillage loosens and fractures the soil to reduce soil strength and to bring or mix residues and fertilizers into the tilled layer. The implements (2 ̆ 2 tools 2 ̆ 2) used for primary tillage include moldboard, chisel and disk plows; heavy tandem, offset and one -way disks; subsoilers; and heavy -duty, powered rotary tillers. These tools usually operate deeper and produce a rougher soil surface than do <b>secondary</b> <b>tillage</b> tools; however, they differ from each other as to amount of soil manipulation and amount of residue left on or near the surface. <b>Secondary</b> <b>tillage</b> is used to kill weeds, cut and cover crop residue, incorporate herbicides and prepare a seedbed. The tools include light- and medium -weight disks, field cultivators, rotary hoes, drags, powered and unpowered harrows and rotary tillers, rollers, ridge- or bed -forming implements, and numerous variations or combinations of these. They operate at a shallower depth than primary tillage tools and provide additional soil pulverization.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} results of a series of {{experiments}} that were set up on agricultural land in central Belgium to investigate soil translocation and erosivity resulting from a <b>secondary</b> <b>tillage</b> operation using an implement sequence of a rotary harrow and seeder. Aluminium cubes were used as tracers of soil movement. Results show that soil displacement resulting from tillage with such an implement sequence is far from insignificant. This is mainly related to the relatively shallow tillage depth {{as well as to the}} loose initial soil condition of such <b>secondary</b> <b>tillage</b> operations. The calculated value for the tillage transport coefficient k (123 kg m(- 1) per tillage operation) is comparable with k-values from implements that are considered to be more erosive, like mouldboard and chisel implements. In conclusion, this study shows that tillage erosion not only results from relatively aggressive tillage operations such as mouldboard and chisel passes, but that secondary operations contribute significantly to soil displacement and tillage erosion.

40|$|In this study, field {{cultivator}} (FC), disk harrow (HD), combination of cultivator with spring teeth and rotary harrow (CS+RH) {{were used as}} <b>secondary</b> <b>tillage</b> equipment in spring. Physical properties of soil such as bulk density, porosity, mean weight diameter and aggregate stability were determined before and after tillage. Moreover, effect of different seedbed preparation techniques on yield of sunflower was also investigated. In {{the result of the}} study, differentiations among the <b>secondary</b> <b>tillage</b> equipment were observed due to bulk density and porosity. Small sized aggregates (1 - 5 mm) were highly in tillage with combination of cultivator with spring teeth and rotary harrow. While the mean weight diameter, which shows the durability of aggregates to water, was 2. 83 mm before tillage, it was 3. 96 mm in tillage with DH, 1. 80 mm in tillage with FC and 2. 50 mm in tillage with combination equipment. Although the mean weight diameter in tillage with DH increased, decreased in tillage with FC. The best aggregate stability obtained from seedbed preparation by disc harrow.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to conduct a field survey in order to find out the values of the factors affecting the agricultural machinery operation cost in farming processes, and then substitute these values in calculating the agricultural machinery operations costs using the equations developed by the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) and compare the results with the actual costs of agricultural machinery operations collected from the field. A survey and data collection were conducted via visits to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry- Department of Agricultural Engineering, the Sudanese Harvesters Company, Central Trading Company, Alneelain Insurance Co., the Agricultural Bank (Sudan), Hilat Kuku Souk for second hand agricultural machinery and the Central Bank of Sudan, beside interviews with agricultural machinery users in both public and private sectors. The study covered the calculation of agricultural machinery cost of operation for three processes; primary tillage, <b>secondary</b> <b>tillage</b> and harvesting). In all three processes, a New Holland tractor model TT 75, 3 - bottom disc plough, Faza 4 rows ridger and Crop Tiger Wheel-TAF 28 harvester were used. Using the ASABE equations, the cost of operation for the primary tillage by the disc plough was found to be SDG 46. 60 per feddan, SDG 34. 83 per feddan for the <b>secondary</b> <b>tillage</b> operation using ridger and SDG 166. 73 per feddan for the cost of harvesting using harvester, while the actual values of the average cost of operation per feddan for the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>tillage</b> operations using disc plough and ridger were found to be SDG 35 and SDG 20 per feddan respectively, and the average cost of operation for wheat harvesting process using harvester was SDG 40 per feddan. The study has revealed a considerable variation in the operation cost per feddan for agricultural machines when the equations of the ASABE were applied as compared to the actual cost per feddan for agricultural processes collected from the field in Sudan, a matter which calls for further field studies to recheck validity of findings stated in this research, aiming at setting standards for the calculations of agricultural machinery cost of operation in the Sudan...|$|E

40|$|Tillage system {{descriptions}} and comparisons are included here. Moldboard plowing, followed by such <b>secondary</b> <b>tillage</b> operations as disking and harrowing, {{was once the}} most common, or traditional, tillage system before planting. Soil erosion potential from rainfall on sloping lands was great and requirements for labor and fuel were high compared to other tillage and planting systems. One {{of the most commonly}} used tillage systems in Nebraska today is two diskings followed by field cultivation. Unfortunately, the potential for soil erosion may be great because the number of tillage operations involved may not leave adequate residue cover for erosion control. Today conservation tillage systems reduce soil erosion and moisture losses while saving labor and fuel. 2 ̆ 2 Conservation tillage 2 ̆ 2 can represent a broad spectrum of farming methods, provided at least 30 percent of the soil surface remains covered with crop residue following planting.

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were done {{to measure the}} effect of different primary tillage methods on the CO 2 flux from soil and to evaluate the effect of conservation tillage tools on short-term CO 2 emissions. The {{experiments were}} conducted on a clay loam soil winter wheat field and a corn field. The three tillage treatments included stubble mulching (disc harrow, mulch tiller, chisel plough), primary tillage (disc harrow, moldboard plough, and chisel plough) and <b>secondary</b> <b>tillage</b> (combined seedbed maker). The control treatment was no-till with soil and residues left by the harvester. The CO 2 flux from the tilled soil surface was measured by a portable closed-chamber tester. Moldboard ploughing produced the roughest soil surface and the highest initial CO 2 flux and maintained the highest flux throughout the experiment. The moldboard ploughing caused higher CO 2 loss than less intensive tillage such as chisel ploughing, mulch cultivating, or disc harrowing. Primary tillage caused higher CO 2 emission in the fall than seedbed preparation did in the spring. These results support increased use of new and improved forms of conservation tillage equipment and offer a significant potential for preserving or increasing soil C levels while decreasing carbon dioxide emissions...|$|E

This analytic study was conducted based on published data from Saudi Agricultural Bank and results of the agricultural census of the Kingdom. Data were analyzed to determine the general trends in averages of implement numbers during the period between 1979 to 1990. Furthermor, effect of the distribution of implements in different regions was determined. Results showed thai Saudi Agricultural Bank distributed implements to twelve primary regions, and the increasing numbers of farm implements in some regions were proportional to the increasing numbers of farm owencrs and not with the area of farm parcels nor with the cultivated area of the region.

40|$|Field {{studies on}} tillage and residue {{management}} for spring corn were conducted at two sites, in Tunliu (1987 - 1990), and Shouyang (1992 - 1995) counties of Shanxi province in the semihumid arid regions of northern China. This paper discusses {{the effects of}} different fall tillage (winter fallow tillage) and residue application methods on soil water profile with time and water use, as well as corn yields. Conservation tillage practices for corn in Shouyang resulted in significantly higher soil water contents, especially in the 0 - 100 cm profiles during April-July and September, than under conventional tillage, providing more available water for corn growth due to increased soil water storage during the rainy season. Conservation tillage with residue application practices generally led to yield advantages. Increases of 18 - 26 % were found for reduced tillage with residue incorporation over the conventional systems. Yields under no-till were equivalent to those from conventional methods, especially in dry years. These {{results suggest that the}} following two alternatives -both reducing the number of <b>secondary</b> <b>tillage</b> passes after the main operation for spring corn production systems: - using deep ploughing with incorporated straw and fertilizers after harvest in fall, and no-till seeding practices - using subsoiling between rows or no-till with residue mulching after harvest in fall, and no-till seeding practices...|$|E
40|$|Suitable soil {{structure}} {{is important for}} crop growth. One of the main characteristics of {{soil structure}} {{is the size of}} soil aggregates. There are several ways of showing the stability of soil aggregates, among which the determination of the median weight diameter of soil aggregates is the most common method. In this paper, a method based on adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was used to describe the soil fragmentation for seedbed preparation with combination of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>tillage</b> implements including subsoiler, moldboard plow and disk harrow. Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is a suitable approach to solving non-linear problems. ANFIS is a combination of fuzzy inference system (FIS) and an artificial neural network (ANN) method and it uses the ability of both models. In this study, the model inputs included “soil moisture content”, “tractor forward speed”and “working depth”. The performance of the model was evaluated using the statistical parameters of root mean square error (RMSE), percentage of relative error (ε), mean absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R 2). These parameters were determined as 0. 135, 3. 6 %, 0. 122 and 0. 981, respectively. For the evaluation of the ANFIS model, the predicted data using this model were compared to the data of artificial neural network model.
