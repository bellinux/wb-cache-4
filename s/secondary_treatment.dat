5|$|The various health {{problems}} associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries, motor vehicle accidents (due to drunk driving), domestic violence, and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified {{the cost to the}} UK of all forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion. All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5 billion.|$|E

25|$|High BOD {{concentrations}} initially {{exceed the}} ability of the <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> ecosystem to utilize available food. Ecosystem populations of aerobic organisms increase until oxygen transfer limitations of the <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> bioreactor are reached. <b>Secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> ecosystem populations may shift toward species with lower oxygen requirements, but failure of those species to use some food sources may produce higher effluent BOD concentrations. More extreme increases in BOD concentrations may drop oxygen concentrations before the <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> ecosystem population can adjust, and cause an abrupt population decrease among important species. Normal BOD removal efficiency will not be restored until populations of aerobic species recover after oxygen concentrations rise to normal.|$|E
40|$|Block {{designs to}} {{which have been}} added a number of singly-replicated <b>treatments,</b> known as <b>secondary</b> <b>treatments,</b> are {{particularly}} useful for experiments where only small amounts of material are available for some treatments, for example new plant varieties. The designs are of particular use in the microarray situation. Such designs are known as 'augmented designs'. This paper obtains the properties of these designs and shows that, with {{an equal number of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>treatments</b> in each block, the A-optimal design is obtained by using the A-optimal design for the original block design. It develops formulae for the variance of treatment comparisons, for both the primary and the <b>secondary</b> <b>treatments.</b> A number of examples are used to illustrate the results.

25|$|In {{conventional}} <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> processes, most of {{the electricity}} is used for aeration, pumping systems and equipment for the dewatering and drying of sewage sludge. Advanced wastewater treatment plants, e.g. for nutrient removal, require more energy than plants that only achieve primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment.</b>|$|E
25|$|A similar problem {{occurs as}} BOD {{concentrations}} drop when low flow increases waste residence time within the <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> bioreactor. <b>Secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> ecosystems of college communities acclimated to waste loading fluctuations from student work/sleep cycles {{may have difficulty}} surviving school vacations. <b>Secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> systems accustomed to routine production cycles of industrial facilities may have difficulty surviving industrial plant shutdown. Populations of species feeding on incoming waste initially decline as concentration of those food sources decrease. Population decline continues as ecosystem predator populations compete for a declining population of lower trophic level organisms.|$|E

50|$|This {{treatment}} {{consists of}} aligning a bone or bones by a gentle, steady pulling action.

30|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>treatments</b> {{are often}} used with septic tanks to treat the final {{effluent}} before disposal and include percolating filters, rotating biological contactors, and increasingly, reed beds (Upton and Green 1995). However, there are {{a wide range of}} small packaged systems available for the treatment of domestic effluent from single or several houses. These are largely based on fixed film or activated sludge systems.|$|R
25|$|Where natural {{waterways}} are {{too small}} to rapidly oxidize primary treated sewage, the liquid may be used to irrigate sewage farms until suburban property values encourage <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> methods requiring less acreage.

30|$|The MS-C 20 mixed monolayers {{formed on}} an aqueous subphase {{containing}} Cd 2 + ions are easily transferred to solid substrates to form Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films, which are blue in {{color in the}} as-deposited state due to the J-band with its peak located around 590 to 594 nm [2 – 5]. Thus, the MS-C 20 binary LB system is suitable for applying <b>secondary</b> <b>treatments</b> to induce structural transitions. In fact, there are many reports on the color-phase transition of the MS-C 20 binary LB system induced by various <b>secondary</b> <b>treatments,</b> such as acid treatments (ATs), basic treatments (BTs), and dry-heat treatments (DHTs) [5, 7, 14, 15]. DHTs as well as ATs in both liquid and gas phases dissociate the J-band, with the film changing from blue to red [6, 8]. On the other hand, BTs in both liquid and gas phases restore the J-band with the film color changing back to blue when applied to the red films after AT or DHT [5, 7].|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} noted, however, that the J-bands {{tend to be}} {{transient}} at the air/water interface and {{the transfer of the}} floating monomolecular films with the target polymorph onto a solid substrate is often difficult [11 – 13]. Thus, in order to overcome the difficulty and realize LB films with various polymorphs of the MS J-aggregates, the application of <b>secondary</b> <b>treatments</b> to the dye LB film is effective.|$|R

25|$|The {{proportion}} of waste water discharges where <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> facilities {{have been provided}} increased significantly from 26% between 1998–1999 to 93% by 2011. This was due predominantly to the new wastewater treatment plants at Ringsend (Dublin) (which, at the time, {{was believed to be}} the largest construction of a new water treatment facility in Europe serving 1.5million people), Cork City, Limerick City, Galway City and Dundalk. The provision of <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> facilities with nutrient reduction also increased.|$|E
25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defined <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> {{based on}} the {{performance}} observed at late 20th-century bioreactors treating typical United States municipal sewage. Secondary treated sewage is expected to produce effluent with a monthly average of less than 30mg/l BOD and less than 30mg/l suspended solids. Weekly averages may be up to 50 percent higher. A sewage treatment plant providing both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> is expected to remove at least 85 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from domestic sewage. The EPA regulations describe stabilization ponds as providing treatment equivalent to <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> removing 65 percent of the BOD and suspended solids from incoming sewage and discharging approximately 50 percent higher effluent concentrations than modern bioreactors. The regulations also recognize the difficulty of meeting the specified removal percentages from combined sewers, dilute industrial wastewater, or Infiltration/Inflow.|$|E

40|$|Starch was {{isolated}} from soft wheat cultivar (Galahad), by wet fractionation. Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA) {{was used to}} examine the surface composition of native and chlorine treated starches, before and after <b>secondary</b> <b>treatments</b> with Pronase enzyme and methanol, which remove respectively, lipid and protein from the starch granule surface. Analysis showed the presence of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus in native starch, with a lower C/ 0 elemental ratio than the theoretical value. This was attributed to the presence of lipid, protein and extraneous hydrocarbon, and confirmed by the analysis of native starch modified by the <b>secondary</b> <b>treatments.</b> Chlorine treatment was found to induce surface oxidation of native starch samples. Covalently bound chlorine was detected which was thought to bind to the lipid and protein residues in preference to the carbohydrate component of starch. Results from chlorinations performed on ovalbumin, cellulose and nylon model polymers supported this postulate. The effects upon native starch and ovalbumin of radio- frequency oxygen plasma, corona discharge and ozonolysis have been examined by ESCA. The oxygen plasma and corona discharge treatments achieved more extensive modifications than chlorine. Ozonolysis produced a similar level of oxidation to that of chlorine treatment, but at a much slower rate. The effects of these novel surface treatments on the performance of starches in cake baking have not been examined...|$|R
40|$|The milk-alkali {{syndrome}} (MAS) was {{a common}} cause of hypercalcemia, metabolic alkalosis, and renal failure in the early 20 th century. This syndrome was first recognized <b>secondary</b> to <b>treatment</b> of peptic ulcer disease with milk and absorbable alkali. Its incidence fell after the introduction of H 2 -blocker and proton pump inhibitor. Persistent ingestion of calcium carbonate and vitamin D caused MAS.

25|$|Wastewater flow {{variations}} may {{be reduced}} by limiting stormwater collection by the sewer system, and by requiring industrial facilities to discharge batch process wastes to the sewer over a time interval rather than immediately after creation. Discharge of appropriate organic industrial wastes may be timed to sustain the <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> ecosystem through periods of low residential waste flow. Sewage treatment systems experiencing holiday waste load fluctuations may provide alternative food to sustain <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> ecosystems through periods of reduced use. Small facilities may prepare a solution of soluble sugars. Others may find compatible agricultural wastes, or offer disposal incentives to septic tank pumpers during low use periods.|$|E
25|$|When EPA {{first opened}} its doors in 1970, the agency had weak {{authority}} to protect U.S. waters, lacking the legal power to write effluent guidelines and possessing only general authority to require <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> from industrial dischargers.|$|E
5000|$|UF can be {{used for}} the removal of {{particulates}} and macromolecules from raw water to produce potable water. It has been used to either replace existing secondary (coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation) and tertiary filtration (sand filtration and chlorination) systems employed in water treatment plants or as standalone systems in isolated regions with growing populations. When treating water with high suspended solids, UF is often integrated into the process, utilising primary (screening, flotation, filtration) and some <b>secondary</b> <b>treatments</b> as pre-treatment stages.

40|$|Contaminants of {{emerging}} concern (CECs) are often poorly removed from wastewater using conventional treatment technologies {{and there is}} limited understanding of their fate during treatment. Inappropriate sampling strategies lead to inaccuracies in estimating removals of CECs. In this study, we used the “fractionated approach” that accounts for the residence time distribution (RTD) in treatment units to investigate the fate of 26 target CECs in a {{municipal wastewater treatment plant}} (WWTP) that includes primary, <b>secondary</b> and tertiary <b>treatment</b> steps[ [...] . ] Analysis of the selected metabolites demonstrated that negative removals obtained could be explained by transformations between the parent compound and their metabolites. This study contributes to the growing literature by applying the fractionated approach to calculate removal of different types of CECs across each wastewater treatment step. An additional level of understanding of the fate of CECs was provided by mass balance calculations in primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>treatments...</b>|$|R
25|$|Measures {{creating}} uniform wastewater loadings tend {{to reduce}} the probability of upsets. Fixed-film or attached growth <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> bioreactors are similar to a plug flow reactor model circulating water over surfaces colonized by biofilm, while suspended-growth bioreactors resemble a continuous stirred-tank reactor keeping microorganisms suspended while water is being treated. <b>Secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> bioreactors may {{be followed by a}} physical phase separation to remove biological solids from the treated water. Upset duration of fixed film <b>secondary</b> <b>treatment</b> systems may be longer because of the time required to recolonize the treatment surfaces. Suspended growth ecosystems may be restored from a population reservoir. Activated sludge recycle systems provide an integrated reservoir if upset conditions are detected in time for corrective action. Sludge recycle may be temporarily turned off to prevent sludge washout during peak storm flows when dilution keeps BOD concentrations low. Suspended growth activated sludge systems can be operated in a smaller space than fixed-film trickling filter systems that treat the same amount of water; but fixed-film systems are better able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.|$|E
