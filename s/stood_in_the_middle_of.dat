5|$|The Patriarchal Cathedral of the Holy Ascension of God {{is located}} {{on top of the}} Tsarevets hill, {{overlooking}} the modern city of Veliko Tarnovo. The church was {{part of a group of}} buildings which constituted the seat of the Bulgarian Patriarchate and acted as the city and the country's main cathedral. The patriarchate on Tsarevets was a fortress of its own, with two defensive towers and an entrance on its west wall. The Patriarchal Cathedral <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> its courtyard.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the fire One Meridian Plaza <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> Philadelphia vacant. The fate of the {{building}} {{was up in the}} air as the building's owners and the insurance company prepared for ligation on how to proceed with repairs, who would control those repairs, and at what cost. E/R Partners were proposing deconstructing the building down to the 19th floor and rebuilding from there. Aetna Corporation, the fire insurer, claimed that girders above the 19th level could be repaired and used cutting $115 million in repair costs from the owner's $250 million estimate. Aetna also proposed taking over the reconstruction. E/R Partners spent $50 million securing One Meridian Plaza and spent up to $500,000 a month on security guards, utilities and inspections by engineers as the building stood empty.|$|E

The description of this area is retrieved from a reconstruction made from the 1812 English army sketch of the Yogyakarta kraton. This area extends about 600 meters to the east of the Segaran lake area. This area consisted of another artificial lake on the southeast of the Magangan complex toward the northeast of Siti Hinggil Kidul complex. In the middle of this artificial lake is another artificial island called Kinupeng Island (Javanese Pulo Kinupeng).

The implosion of the building, originally planned for 2003, was delayed for years due to legal issues. The prison <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> a residential neighborhood, within blocks of two separate hospitals. The neighbors worried about the impact an implosion of such a building {{would have on the}} air. After a drawn out court battle, and environmental impact studies, it was agreed to demolish the prison by hand, floor by floor from the top down. As of 2008, the center buildings have been demolished. All that remains is the perimeter wall of the base, and the older original Caseros prison next door.|$|E

She added that the latter was [...] "particularly pleasant to hear live; the Zedd beat was made to be experienced in a club and its crunch was felt all over the dancefloor." [...] Conversely, Hilary Hughes from USA Today felt that the simplest moments of the performances were the ones featuring toned down versions of her singles like [...] "Born This Way" [...] and [...] "Poker Face", rather than the [...] "extravagant" [...] choreography during [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and [...] "G.U.Y."

2500|$|Mark {{played a}} key role in the {{development}} of thermonuclear weapons in the early 1950s. A crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb was approved by President Harry S. Truman in January 1950 at Edward Teller's urging before the laboratory had a workable design. This put the laboratory under great pressure. Hans Bethe recalled that [...] "There was a lot of controversy in Los Alamos in those days, and Carson always was imperturbable and <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> it and had a balanced judgment." [...] When Stanislaw Ulam finally came up with a workable design, it was Mark that he approached first. Mark took the Ulam design to Bradbury, and they put the idea to Teller. [...] "Teller then completed and extended the invention," [...] Bethe noted, [...] "so, in this case, Carson was the mediator between two people who really didn't like each other." [...] "Within an hour of Carson's ... remarks," [...] Teller recalled, [...] "I knew how to move ahead". The Teller-Ulam design would become that of all thermonuclear weapons.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2006 U.S. Open, {{played on}} the West course of the Winged Foot Golf Club, Montgomerie had yet another chance to win his first major championship.

While waiting in {{position}} on the 18th fairway for the group in front to finish, Montgomerie switched his club from a 6-iron to a 7-iron, assuming adrenaline would kick in. Once the wait was over, he hit the approach shot poorly, ending up short and right of the green, in thick rough. He pitched onto the green, and then three-putted from 30 feet to lose the tournament by one stroke. After the loss, Montgomerie said, [...] "At my age I've got to think positively. I'm 43 next week, and it's nice I can come back to this tournament and do well again, and I look forward to coming back here again next year and trying another U.S. Open disaster."

2500|$|The {{incident}} {{took place}} at the north edge of Tiananmen Square, along Chang'an Avenue, on June 5, 1989, one day after the Chinese government's violent crackdown on the Tiananmen protests. The man <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the wide avenue, directly in the path of a column of approaching Type 59 tanks. Stuart Franklin, who was on assignment for TIME magazine, told the New York Times, [...] "At some point, shots were fired and the tanks carried on down the road toward us, leaving Tiananmen Square behind, until blocked by a lone protester." [...] He wore a white shirt and black trousers, and he held two shopping bags. As the tanks came to a stop, the man gestured towards the tanks with one of the bags. In response, the lead tank attempted to drive around the man, but the man repeatedly stepped into the path of the tank in a show of nonviolent action. After repeatedly attempting to go around rather than crush the man, the lead tank stopped its engines, and the armored vehicles behind it seemed to follow suit. There was a short pause with the man and the tanks having reached a quiet, still impasse.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Imperial Eagle" [...] (Kenzo Suzuki) and the [...] "Italian Eagle" [...] (Marco Corleone) were {{accompanied}} by CMLL Luchadora Mima Shimoda to the right for the main event match. During the early parts of the match the crowd would actually cheer for the rudo team at times, especially Marco Corleone, choosing to side with him instead of the recently turned Universo 2000 and Shocker who had not done a lot to earn the crowd's respect {{leading up to the}} match. Shocker pinned Corleone after just over four minutes of wrestling, putting his team up by a point. The second fall is about the length of the first one, approximately four minutes and saw the rudo team of Corleone and Suzuki win after Corleone executed a [...] "Superman Flight", one of his signature high flying moves off the top rope, and pinned Unverso 2000. With the match tied the third fall, both teams took more chances, including Corleone getting caught up on the ropes during one of his leaps out of the ring. The match saw Universo 2000 pin Kenzo Suzuki, followed by Marco Corleone pinning Universo 2000, leaving only himself and Shocker as the legal men in the match. When the referee turned his back Universo 2000 landed a low-blow on Marco Corleone, making it easy for Shocker to pin him for the third and deciding fall. After the match both Corleone and Suzuki <b>stood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the ring while the designated barber cut their hair off and then shaved them completely bald to fulfill the Luchas de Apuestas stipulation.|$|E
