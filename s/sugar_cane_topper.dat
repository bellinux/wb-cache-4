This study is aimed to investigate the possibility of treating <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> leaves and bagasse via vermicomposting by using Eudrillus eugeniae (African night crawler) worms. Therefore, the study compared degradation potential between <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> bagasse and leaves. Each of <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> bagasse and leaves were mixed with soil at selected waste to soil ratios namely 9 : 1, 7 : 3 and 1 : 1. Ten Eudrillus eugeniae with an average weight of 2. 5 ± 0. 1 g were added to each experimental set-up excluding the control. The result indicated that active burrowing potential of the worm into the soil was able to degrade the <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> leaves and <b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> bagasse within 5 weeks and 6 weeks respectively. Also, the 1 : 1 treatment showed greater reduction of waste with increasing number of worms as compared with 9 : 1 treatment.
