Yamaguchi wanted to create a song that was hard to critically review due to its complexity, and that music consumers could not evaluate listening to a <b>single</b> <b>sample.</b> Yamaguchi wrote a song that was similar in style to songs in a Japanese school chorus competition: songs without a chorus but with multiple different verses. He made the first section begin with a kayōkyoku-inspired pop melody, so that the song could be understood by casual pop music listeners.|$|E

40|$|Acceptance Sampling is the {{methodology}} {{which deals with}} procedures through which decisions to accept or reject of a lot {{which are based on}} the result of inspection of samples. The foundation of the scheme of acceptance sampling has laid by Dodge and Romig (1959). General procedures and necessary tables are provided for the selection of <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> plan through tangent angle as proposed by Norman Bush (1953). Mandelson (1962) has explained the desirability for developing a system of sampling plans indexed through MAPD. Mayer (1967) has explained that the quality standard that the MAPD can be considered as a quality level with other conditions to specify the OC curve. Soundararajan (1975) has constructed tables for selection of <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> plan indexed through MAPD and K (pT/p*) Suresh and Ramkumar (1996) have studied the selection of <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> plan indexed through Maximum Allowable Average Outgoing Quality (MAAOQ) and MAPD. This paper provides a new procedure for designing a <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> plan indexed through trigonometric ratios, hypotenuse ratios along with decision region (d 1) and probabilistic region (d 2) which is more applicable in practical situations.

30|$|The {{traditional}} {{sampling plans}} are applied when the experimenter or the producer is certain about the proportion parameter. So, the sampling plans having {{the assumption of}} determined value cannot be applied when there is uncertainty or indeterminacy about proportion parameter. The fuzzy sampling plans have been widely applied for the lot sentencing when there is uncertainty in the proportion parameter. Several authors contributed to designing the sampling plan using the fuzzy approach, see for example, Cheng et al. [2] proposed a fuzzy testing process to select a better process. Jamkhaneh et al. [3] studied the effect of inspection error using the <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> plan. Sadeghpour Gildeh et al. [4] and Jamkhaneh and Gildeh [5] designed double sampling plan under the fuzzy approach. Turanoğlu et al. [6] studied the characteristic curve of the sampling plan. Jamkhaneh and Gildeh [7] proposed the fuzzy sequential sampling plan. Divya [8] worked on a <b>single</b> <b>sampling</b> plan using the Poisson distribution. Venkateh and Elango [9] designed sampling plan for fuzzy gamma distribution. Kahraman et al. [10] designed the <b>single</b> and double <b>sampling</b> plans under the fuzzy approach.
