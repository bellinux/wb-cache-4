40|$|Question How do species {{traits and}} abiotic factors {{influence}} {{the extent of}} hydrochorous dispersal {{into and out of}} a small floodplain area along a free-flowing river in The Netherlands? Location The Kappersbult nature reserve (53 degrees 07 ' 28 ' N, 6 degrees 37 ' 14 ' E), which is a floodplain along the Dutch River Drentsche Aa. Methods Seeds transported by the river were collected in fine mesh nets for 24 consecutive hours {{once or twice a week}} for 1 year, upstream and downstream of the studied floodplain. Data on the captured seeds were related to species traits and abiotic factors and species composition in the floodplain. Results The floodplain functioned both as a seed source and sink. High levels of river water seemed to promote seed transport to or from the floodplain. Seeds of riverbank species occurred significantly more often in the river water than expected. Net source species had significantly higher seed production, taller stature and higher seed buoyancy, but lower site elevation than net <b>sink</b> <b>species.</b> Seed weight was significantly higher for <b>sink</b> <b>species</b> than for other species. Conclusion Our study found that inundation, and therefore more natural river water management, is a prerequisite for seed transport to and from a floodplain. The restoration of target floodplain vegetation may be successful for common species that produce many seeds and grow in proximity to the river. Consequently, it is expected that the probability of restoring vegetation types that occur further from the river, such as wet grasslands, by hydrochorous dispersal is low...|$|E

40|$|Phytoplankton {{requires}} {{light for}} photosynthesis, but most phytoplankton species are heavier than water and sink. How can these <b>sinking</b> <b>species</b> persist? Here we show, {{by means of}} an advection-diffusion-reaction equation of light-limited phytoplankton, that the answer lies in the turbulent motion of water that re-disperses phytoplankton over the vertical water column. More specifically, we show that there is a turbulence window sustaining <b>sinking</b> phytoplankton <b>species.</b> If turbulent diffusion is too high, phytoplankton is mixed to great depths and the depth-averaged light conditions are too low to allow net positive population growth. Conversely, if turbulent diffusion is too low, sinking phytoplankton populations end up at the ocean floor and succumb in the dark. At intermediate levels of turbulent diffusion, however, the model predicts that phytoplankton populations can outgrow both mixing rates and sinking rates. In this way, the reproducing population as a whole can maintain a position in the well-lit zone {{near the top of the}} water column, even if all individuals within the population have a tendency to sink. This theory unites earlier classic results by Sverdrup and Riley as well as our own recent findings, and provides a novel conceptual framework for the understanding of phytoplankton dynamics under influence of mixing processes...|$|R

We studied the separated and combined responses to nutrient inputs and mixing, of a phytoplankton community, in terms of size fractionated photosynthetic activity and biomass, exported biomass and species composition. The community was composed of two dominant species, which differed in their sinking velocity. Experiments were conducted during 8 days in 12 water columns of 50 L, in light and temperature controlled conditions. The nutrient input {{was found to be}} the predominant factor affecting sedimentary fluxes and community composition, but mixing had also a significant effect on the community structure and sedimentary fluxes when combined with nutrient inputs. In this latter case, the large <b>sinking</b> <b>species,</b> Tribonema sp.

In {{this study we}} exploit recent advances in high-resolution autonomous monitoring to investigate the impact of short-term variations in wind-induced mixing on the surface biomass and vertical distribution of buoyant and <b>sinking</b> phytoplankton <b>species.</b> An autonomous platform (the Automatic Water Quality Monitoring Station) moored in a Mediterranean reservoir provided minute-by-minute records of wind speed and the phytoplankton fluorescence during winter and summer. This information was then used here to quantify the impact of short-term changes in the weather on the vertical distribution of diatoms and cyanobacteria. Additionally, we apply an empirical model {{to determine the extent}} of entrainment of diatoms and cyanobacteria within the turbulent upper layers of the water column. During winter, the surface time series of fluorescence was positively correlated with the short-term variations in wind speed. In contrast, during the summer, fluorescence was negatively correlated with wind speed. In the latter case, turbulence overcame the flotation velocity of buoyant cyanobacteria, thus homogenizing their vertical distribution and decreasing surface biomass. In both cases, the dynamic response of surface phytoplankton biomass to short-term changes in wind stress was rapid, within the minute scale. As far as we know from the literature, this is the first study in which the interaction between wind stress and surface phytoplankton fluorescence has been quantified on such a fine temporal scale.

A sensitive fluorometric technique was used to rapidly and accurately measure nanomolar concentrations of ammonium at ecologically relevant concentrations from 25 - 2, 250 nM. Previous studies typically monitored uptake from enriched ambient mediums (5, 000 - 100, 000 nM). A unique response from the hermatypic coral Porites porites was a net, positive ammonium flux (3. 54 nmol NH 4 cm- 2 h- 1). Otherwise, the other three ammonium <b>sink</b> <b>species</b> generated net negative fluxes from - 0. 29 ± - 1. 09 nmol NH 4 cm- 2 h- 1. Ammonium depletion trends showed that over time D. stokesii, H. incrassata, and D. cervicornis took up ammonium until the ambient medium became limiting and uptake rates approached zero at the lowest measured concentrations of 76, 45, and 26 nM, respectively. There was inter- and intraspecific variation of ammonium uptake rates from various initial ammonium concentrations (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Kinetic uptake parameters (Vm and KS) were calculated for sink organisms and found to be highly variable between individuals in a species. Half-saturation constant (KS) ranges values for D. cervicornis and H. incrassata were near or below literature values for other tropical algae, while KS value ranges for D. stokesii were slightly higher than values reported for other hermatypic corals.

40|$|The {{lifetime}} of methane is controlled {{to a very}} large extent by the abundance of the OH radical. The tropics are a key region for methane removal, with oxidation in the lower tropical troposphere dominating the global methane removal budget (Bloss et al., 2005). In tropical forested environments where biogenic VOC emissions are high and NOx concentrations are low, OH concentrations {{are assumed to be}} low due to rapid reactions with <b>sink</b> <b>species</b> such as isoprene. New, simultaneous measurements of OH concentrations and OH reactivity, k'OH, in a Borneo rainforest are reported and show much higher OH than predicted, with mean peak concentrations of ~ 2. 5 &times; 10 6 molecule cm− 3 (10 min average) observed around solar noon. Whilst j(O 1 D) and humidity were high, low O 3 concentrations limited the OH production from O 3 photolysis. Measured OH reactivity was very high, peaking at a diurnal average of 29. 1 &plusmn; 8. 5 s− 1 , corresponding to an OH {{lifetime of}} only 34 ms. To maintain the observed OH concentration given the measured OH reactivity requires a rate of OH production approximately 10 times greater than calculated using all measured OH sources. A test of our current understanding of the chemistry within a tropical rainforest was made using a detailed zero-dimensional model to compare with measurements. The model over-predicted the observed HO 2 concentrations and significantly under-predicted OH concentrations. Inclusion of an additional OH source formed as a recycled product of OH initiated isoprene oxidation improved the modelled OH agreement but only served to worsen the HO 2 model/measurement agreement. To replicate levels of both OH and HO 2 , a process that recycles HO 2 to OH is required; equivalent to the OH recycling effect of 0. 74 ppbv of NO. This recycling step increases OH concentrations by 88 % at noon and has wide implications, leading to much higher predicted OH over tropical forests, with a concomitant reduction in the CH 4 lifetime and increase in the rate of VOC degradation...|$|E

As in 1998, the 2000 ISCAT study revealed a strong oxidizing environment at South Pole (SP). During the 2000 investigation, however, the suite of measurements was greatly expanded. These new measurements established the recycling of reactive nitrogen as a critical component of this unique environment. This paper first presents the historical background leading up to the ISCAT 2000 observations; then it focuses on providing a summary of the year 2000 results and contrasts these with those recorded during 1998. Important developments made during the 2000 study included the recording of SP data for several species being emitted from the snowpack. These included NO, H 2 O 2 and CH 2 O. In this context, eddy-diffusion flux measurements provided the first quantitative estimates of the SP NO and NOx snow-to-atmosphere fluxes. This study also revealed that HNO 3 and HO 2 NO 2 were major <b>sink</b> <b>species</b> for HOx and NOx radicals. And, it identified the critical factors responsible for SP NO levels exceeding those at other polar sites by nearly an order of magnitude.

It is proposed that {{this is due to the}} influence of NO on the distribution of OH in the lower free troposphere over a region that extends well beyond the plateau itself.

40|$|Phytoplankton {{population}} dynamics {{are controlled by}} the relative rather than absolute timescales of mixing, growth, and loss processes such as sedimentation, grazing, and so on. Here, the vertical distribution and biomass of phytoplankton populations are quantified by two timescale ratios: the Peclet number Pe—the ratio of mixing and sedimentation timescales—and the growth number G—the ratio of sedimentation and net growth timescales. Three mixing regimes are defined for phytoplankton and other particles. For Pe � 100, the population is translated linearly down the water column over time and will leave the surface mixing layer completely after sedimentation time � s. For 0. 1 � Pe � 100, the population distribution depends on the relative magnitude of Pe and G. Finally, for Pe � 0. 1, the population will be vertically uniform, and biomass changes exponentially over time with characteristic timescale � c � � s/(G � 1). This analysis is valid for negatively buoyant phytoplankton, except when mixing time is much longer than growth time and Pe � 0. 1, which can occur for very slow <b>sinking</b> <b>species.</b> These regimes {{can be used for}} assessing the effect of changes in the mixing, growth, or sedimentation conditions on {{population dynamics}}.

40|$|In {{present study}} I defined {{a new type}} of network, the {{statistic}} network. The statistic network is a weighted and non-deterministic network. In the statistic network, a connection value, i. e., connection weight, represents connection strength and connection likelihood between two nodes and its absolute value falls in the interval (0, 1]. The connection value is expressed as a statistical measure such as correlation coefficient, association coefficient, or Jaccard coefficient, etc. In addition, all connections of the statistic network can be statistically tested for their validity. A connection is true if the connection value is statistically significant. If all connection values of a node are not statistically significant, it is an isolated node. An isolated node has not any connection to other nodes in the statistic network. Positive and negative connection values denote distinct connectiontypes (positive or negative association or interaction). In the statistic network, two nodes with the greater connection value will show more similar trend in the change of their states. At any time we can obtain a sample network of the statistic network. A sample network is a non-weighted and deterministic network. Thestatistic network, in particular the plant association network that constructed from field sampling, is mostly an information network. Most of the interspecific relationships in plant community are competition and cooperation. Therefore in comparison to animal networks, the methodology of statistic network is moresuitable to construct plant association networks. Some conclusions were drawn from this study: (1) in the plant association network, most connections are weak and positive interactions. The association network constructed from Spearman rank correlation has most connections and isolated taxa are fewer. From net linear correlation,linear correlation, to Spearman rank correlation, the practical number of connections and connectance in the constructed network increases. Network compactness also follows the trend. In addition, as the increase of network compactness and connectance, the portion and number of negative association declines dramatically. (2) In an association (interaction) network, only a few connections follow the linear relationship. Most connections follow the quasi-linear or non-linear relationships. (3) The association networks constructed from partial linear correlation and linear correlation measures are generally scale-free complex networks. The degree of these networks is power low distributed. (4) Isolated species (families, etc.) are likely important in the statistic network. They are the <b>sink</b> <b>species</b> for shaping new network after a community is seriously disturbed.

In contrast, diatoms of the iron-limited Antarctic Circumpolar Current sequester silicon, but comparatively little carbon, in the underlying deep ocean and sediments. Because the Southern Ocean {{is the major}} hub of oceanic nutrient distribution, selective silicon sequestration there limits diatom blooms elsewhere and consequently the biotic carbon sequestration potential of the entire ocean. We investigated this paradox in an in situ iron fertilization experiment by comparing accumulation and sinking of diatom populations {{inside and outside the}} iron-fertilized patch over 5 wk. A bloom comprising various thin- and thick-shelled diatom species developed inside the patch despite the presence of large grazer populations. After the third week, most of the thinner-shelled diatom species underwent mass mortality, formed large, mucous aggregates, and sank out en masse (carbon sinkers). In contrast, thicker-shelled species, in particular Fragilariopsis kerguelensis, persisted in the surface layers, sank mainly empty shells continuously, and reduced silicate concentrations to similar levels {{both inside and outside the}} patch (silica sinkers). These patterns imply that thick-shelled, hence grazer-protected, diatom species evolved in response to heavy copepod grazing pressure in the presence of an abundant silicate supply. The ecology of these silica-sinking species decouples silicon and carbon cycles in the iron-limited Southern Ocean, whereas carbon- <b>sinking</b> <b>species,</b> when stimulated by iron fertilization, export more carbon per silicon.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} a nonlocal reaction-diffusion-advection equation which models {{the growth of}} a single phytoplankton species in a water column where the species depends solely on light for its metabolism. We study the combined effect of death rate, sinking or buoyant coefficient, water column depth and vertical turbulent diffusion rate on the persistence of a single phytoplankton species. Under a general reproductive rate which is an increasing function of light intensity, we establish the existence of a critical death rate; i. e., the phytoplankton survives if and only if its death rate is less than the critical death rate. The critical death rate is a strictly monotone decreasing function of sinking or buoyant coefficient and water column depth, and it is also a strictly monotone decreasing function of turbulent diffusion rate for buoyant species. In contrast to critical death rate, critical sinking or buoyant velocity, critical water column depth and critical turbulent diffusion rate may or may not exist. For instance, it is shown that if the death rate is suitably small with respect to the water column depth, the phytoplankton can persist for any sinking or buoyant velocity; i. e., there is no critical sinking or buoyant velocity under such situation. We further show that critical water column depth, critical sinking or buoyant velocity and critical turbulent diffusion rate for buoyant species can exist for some intermediate range of phytoplankton death rates and, whenever they exist, are always unique. In strong contrast, we show that there may exist two critical turbulent diffusion rates for <b>sinking</b> <b>species.</b> The phytoplankton forms a thin layer at {{the surface of the water}} column for sufficiently large buoyant rate, and it forms a thin layer at the bottom of the water column for sufficiently large sinking rate.

40|$|Iodine is an {{important}} element in oceanic, atmospheric, and terrestrial systems. Firstly, radical reactions in the troposphere can lead to significant ozone depletion, and secondly, nucleation of gaseous iodine molecules can produce new aerosol formation events, presenting possible direct and indirect natural cooling effects on climate. In the terrestrial environment iodine is a vital micronutrient for all mammals, with a lack of iodine intake leading to several debilitating disorders such as goiter and cretinism. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate iodine systematics, and particularly speciation, in the atmosphere (aerosols, rain, and snow) and terrestrial hydrosphere (lakes) in order to gain a better understanding of how iodine moves between and within each environmental compartment. A subsidiary aim was to develop an inexpensive, but sensitive and accurate method for iodine quantification in soils and sediments using conventional analytical equipment. Rain and snow samples were taken from both northern (Germany, Switzerland, Ireland, Greenland) and southern (Australia, New Zealand, Chile) hemispheres whereas aerosols were obtained from Mace Head, Ireland using cascade (5 stages) and PM 2. 5 impactors. Iodine cycling in lakes was investigated in the Mummelsee, a small headwater lake in the Black Forest. Speciation measurements were conducted by coupling an ion chromatograph to an ICP-MS and the organic fraction calculated as total iodine minus the inorganic species iodide and iodate. Organically bound iodine was the most abundant fraction in the atmospheric aqueous phase, despite the fact that iodine oxides are currently thought to be the theoretical <b>sink</b> <b>species.</b> Aerosols from Mace Head, Ireland, contained a median of 50 pmol m- 3 total iodine, with more than 90 % being associated with organic matter. Iodide was the next most abundant species (median 5 %) with iodate being the least abundant (median 0. 8 %). Similar results were found in the precipitation samples from northern and southern hemispheres, with organic iodine composing over half of the total iodine, and in the snow from Greenland up to 88 %; although in general the organic fraction was lower in precipitation than in aerosols. Up to 5 unidentified peaks, representing iodine species in addition to iodide and iodate, were observed in aerosol and precipitation chromatograms, providing direct evidence for organic iodine compounds in aerosols and precipitation. While these species remain unidentified, they are thought to be anionic and relatively small (i. e. low molecular weight). It is suggested that these compounds and iodide form during (photolytic) decomposition of organo-I of high molecular weight, the organic material possibly stemming from the ocean surface microlayer. It was also found that orographically induced precipitation significantly effects iodine concentrations in snow, with iodine levels decreasing exponentially with altitude over a transect in the Black Forest; indeed, more than halving (38 to 13 nmol l- 1) over an altitude change of 840 m and horizontal distance of only 5 km. It is suggested that orographic affects may be more important than lateral distance from the ocean in determining iodine levels in continental precipitation. Once precipitation enters terrestrial ecosystems it may interact with soils, rocks, and biota. Iodine levels in the Mummelsee were very similar to rain and snow, averaging 15. 2 ± 2. 4 nmol l- 1, suggesting at very little iodine input from the catchment geology. Iodine in the lake and the spring inflow was dominantly associated with organic matter with, on average, 85 ± 7 % organically bound. However, inorganic iodine cycling in the lake was also important, and displayed pronounced redox chemistry, with both iodide release from the sediments and iodate reduction in the hypolimnion during anoxic stratified conditions. The iodide flux (up to 10. 1 nmol m- 2 d- 1) back into the water column is probably due to the decomposition of detritus in the top few centimeters of the sediments. In contrast to the hypolimnion, iodide was removed from the epilimnion during the summer and autumn months, whereas iodate levels increased slightly over the same time period, suggesting at the importance of biological reactions. This was supported by a sediment core that contained high iodine concentrations, averaging 92 μmol kg- 1 total iodine, and a significant correlation with organic carbon (p< 0. 001). The analytical method entailed combusting sediment or soil samples in the oven of an AOX apparatus at 1000 oC and trapping the vapours in Milli-Q water. The solution was then analysed for iodine by a kinetic UV/Vis photospectrometry whereby iodide quantitatively catalyses the oxidation of As 3 + and reduction of chromophoric Ce 4 +. The method was shown to be sensitive (detection limit 49 ng at 95 % confidence) and precise with relative standard deviations less than 5 %. In conclusion, while this work has shown that organic matter plays a very important role in the hydrosphere, particularly in regards to iodine cycling, considerably more work needs to be conducted on themes such as identifying the organic iodine species, how is the iodine bound to the organic material and what is the role of organisms in the formation of organic iodine. With the current interest in iodine chemistry it is hoped that these and many other pressing questions will be answered in the near future...|$|E
40|$|Higher surface {{production}} is generally reflected in higher {{organic carbon content}} of the underlying sediments. The bulk of the accumulating carbon {{is believed to be}} exported by aggregation and sinking of intact cells and chains in the aftermath of diatom blooms. Less is known about the factors triggering the sinking process and the mechanisms of aggregate formation. We studied the growth and demise of individual diatom species populations during an in situ phytoplankton bloom induced by artificial iron fertilization (EIFEX: European Iron Fertilization Experiment). A massive flux event, which appeared as spikes in vertical transmissometer profiles and was confirmed by discrete water-column sampling, started on day 26 during which about half the suspended particulate organic carbon was exported out of the surface mixed layer. A significant fraction of the sinking particles reached the sea floor at 3700 m depth within 10 days. These speeds can only be reached by prior formation of large aggregates. The species composition of the diatoms in the deep water column indicated that some <b>species</b> <b>sank</b> out quantitatively, others seemed to have been entrained in the sinking aggregates and yet others escaped entrainment and sinking and continued growth in the surface layer after the <b>sinking</b> event. <b>Species</b> of the long-spined diatom genus Chaetoceros appear to have {{played a major role in}} the aggregate formation and sinking event. The results of the experiment suggest that large-scale fertilization of the Southern Ocean could well function as one of several strategies to combat ongoing global warming and surface ocean acidification...|$|R

40|$|The {{intriguing}} {{impact of}} physical mixing processes on species interactions has always fascinated ecologists. Here, we exploit {{recent advances in}} plankton models to develop competition theory that predicts how changes in turbulent mixing affect competition for light between buoyant and <b>sinking</b> phytoplankton <b>species.</b> We compared the model predictions with a lake experiment, in which the turbulence structure of the entire lake was manipulated using artificial mixing. Vertical eddy diffusivities were calculated from the measured temperature microstructure in the lake. Changes in turbulent mixing of the lake caused a dramatic shift in phytoplankton species composition, consistent with the predictions of the competition model. The buoyant and potentially toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis dominated at low turbulent diffusivity, whereas sinking diatoms and green algae dominated at high turbulent diffusivity. These findings warn that changes in the turbulence structure of natural waters, for instance driven by climate change, may induce major shifts in the species composition of phytoplankton communities...|$|R

In oxygen-free atmospheres, satisfying results were obtained with thick, uncoiled Ta filaments, arranged vertically.

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} supports {{the contribution of}} local inflammation {{to the development of}} Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, although the precise mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we demonstrate that the pro-inflammatory protein S 100 A 9 interacts with the Ab 1 – 40 peptide and promotes the formation of fibrillar b-amyloid structures. This interaction also results in reduced S 100 A 9 cytotoxicity by the binding of S 100 A 9 toxic species to Ab 1 – 40 amyloid structures. These results suggest that secretion of S 100 A 9 during inflammation promotes the formation of amyloid plaques.
