International audienceInherited {{from the}} mid- 20 th century, the European {{organization}} of national railways in state-owned, integrated and few regulated monopolies is not relevant anymore. Although {{this has been}} an interesting answer to the problems of externalities, investments and regulation, changes have occurred in technology, demand and economical analysis. In particular, economists have proposed many regulation schemes, which lead the regulators to increase the efficiency of the firms operating on the market. Because of the high costs of rail transportation, governments decide to liberalize the market; in particular, the European Commission and the European Parliament wish the passenger rail market opening. However, some countries, like France, <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>opened</b> their passenger rail market, which is currently monopolized by the historic and national operator, the SNCF. In this paper, we assume that for social, political and economical (economies of density, network externalities) reasons, the regional passenger traffic will remain operated by the SNCF, in the coming years. However, we propose a regulation framework, based on yardstick competition (comparisons of performances), which could encourage the SNCF to improve the efficiency of its regional trains. Yardstick competition consists in estimating what should be the best prices and subsidies, by comparing the performance of several similar and regulated firms, operating on several monopoly markets. If an operator seems to be relatively efficient according to comparisons, it has to be rewarded. On the other hand, an inefficient operator has to be punished, so that the comparison mechanism promotes competition. The paper aims at analysing the introduction of yardstick competition on the French market of regional rail transport operation. We show that the implementation of yardstick competition permits the local regulators to preserve the monopoly of the SNCF and to develop a virtual competition between its local activities. This leads to improve the efficiency of the regional operators and to increase the expertise of the rail regulators. In {{the first part of the}} paper, we discuss the implementation of yardstick competition on the French market of regional rail transport operation. First we describe what is called yardstick competition and how it could be implemented on this market. Then, we show that paradoxically to the preservation of the SNCF monopoly, the new market structure of the regional passenger rail transport (regionalized in 2002) is suitable for such an implementation of yardstick competition. In the second part, we examine some theoretical, economical models. On the one hand, we explain why the use of comparisons benefits to the rail regulators (reduction of its capture by the operator, reduction of uncertainty [...] .). On the other hand, we review and discuss some limits of the mechanism (external heterogeneity of the compared operators, investment incentives, and collusion [...] .). In the third part, we present the results of an econometric treatment, estimating the efficiency scores of the regional operators. First, we describe the cost-data base used, before resolving the question of external heterogeneity between the operators. It appears that the only explanatory variable of the external inefficiency is the delinquency rate: in some regions, the operator has to employ more ticket inspectors due to the delinquency. Then we explain the followed methodology and discuss the outcomes of the model. Operators' efficiency scores vary from 0. 8 (for the worst) to 1 (for the best). Those internal inefficiencies may be due to sub-optimal spatial organization or employee rotations, the operation of rural trains with two agents although one is sufficient, informational rent or local strikes. Hence, we conclude that yardstick competition could be an original and efficient way of introducing “intramodal” competition in the regional passenger rail market...|$|E
50|$|In {{line with}} the company's restructuring, in May 2004, Louisiana-Pacific {{announced}} a strategic plan to convert LP's Hayward, Wisc., commodity oriented strand board (OSB) mill to make SmartSide siding products and replace this capacity with a new, state-of-the-art, low-cost OSB mill in Alabama. The conversion of the Hayward Mill was scheduled for 2005. The project agreement for the Alabama mill was signed in June 2005, with production start-up slated for late 2007. As of 2011, the mill <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>opened.</b> But the company <b>has</b> said it <b>still</b> intends to reopen the 130-worker Clarke County mill, which can make more than 700 million square feet a year of OSB at full capacity.|$|R

50|$|Los Angeles, California. In {{this chapter}} Astair is {{home with her}} twin eight-year-old daughters Shasti and Freya. She notices that rain is leaking through the ceiling and thinks about calling their landlord, Cyril Kosiginski. Her phone is {{constantly}} ringing because of Mefisto’s prank, and she has unplugged the landlines. She <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>opened</b> the thick manila envelope on her bed that contains her graded thesis from her advisor. It is titled Hope’s Nest: On the Necessity of God, a title she now considers “winceworthy.” She thinks about how successful her colleagues have been and doubts that she will {{do as well as}} they have. Then she realizes that her friend Taymor has arrived to pick them all up, but before they leave the twins want to know about Xanther’s surprise. She wishes they would show more sympathy for Xanther, and thinks about how Xanther has no companion—not Dov and not her sisters—which is why Astair wants to get her the surprise. At the end of the chapter she tells Shasti and Freya that the surprise is a dog.|$|R

[...] "All {{that has happened to}} you," [...] they said, [...] "we also have undergone, and we should be enjoying the same happiness <b>still,</b> <b>had</b> we <b>not</b> <b>opened</b> the Golden Door while the princesses were absent. You have been no wiser than we, and have suffered the same punishment. We would gladly receive you among us, to perform such penance as we do, but we have already told you that this is impossible. Depart, therefore, from hence and go to the Court of Bagdad, where you shall meet with him that can decide your destiny." [...] They told me the way I was to travel, and I left them.|$|R

Durand will fund the furnishing of the middle school and will pay for the construction of sixth form accommodation for older children. It was hoped that the first pupils would start to arrive from September 2012; however in April 2013 the Academy <b>had</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> <b>opened,</b> with the National Trust expressing doubts about the development's environmental impact in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty; some residents in the area opposing its opening; and queries over the funding: [...] "Opponents of the scheme, who have consulted Melvyn Roffe, headmaster of a state boarding school in Norfolk, argue that the school's financial estimates are unrealistically low or to quote Roffe, talking to the Independent, [...] "ludicrous". Margaret Hodge, chair of the public accounts committee, has asked the National Audit Office to investigate the DoE's [...] "investment decision" [...] and the basis upon which the £17 million grant was made." ...|$|R
5000|$|Over 14 {{years after}} {{construction}} began and {{nearly a decade}} after it had been supposed to open, the Super Power Building <b>had</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> been <b>opened.</b> It <b>has</b> been valued at $80 million by county assessors. In August 2013 the Church disclosed that it was planning to open the building on October 6, 2013 with a dedication ceremony expected to draw in an estimated 10,000 Scientologists in attendance. Only a month later, however, the Church told city authorities that it had decided to cancel the ceremony and postpone {{the opening of the}} building to an unspecified date, for undisclosed reasons. The building was finally opened on November 17, 2013 with Scientologist stars such as Tom Cruise, John Travolta and Kelly Preston in attendance for a ceremony presided over by Scientology leader David Miscavige. The number of Scientologists attending the ceremony was reported by the local media to have been far lower than the Church had forecast in advance, perhaps below 6,000 people, though the Church asserted in a press release that it had been [...] "slightly over the expected 10,000 people".|$|R
40|$|The changes {{which took}} place {{a quarter of a}} century ago in the {{countries}} of Europe’s Eastern Bloc transformed the social conventions of the time. A kind of social dialog has been started, about the Holocaust amongst other things. New memorials and monuments dedicated to the Holocaust have been constructed in the countries of the region as a result. Several phases can be identified in the building of monuments to the Holocaust over the past 25 years. These changes in the process of recollection and in the building of the monuments themselves are typified by the House of Fates project. The memorial center was built in Budapest for the 70 th anniversary of the Holocaust. But the changes in recollection did not stop there, did not come to a standstill in Hungary. It is a mark of the sensitivity of the subject that although the center was finished by the fall of 2015, it <b>has</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> <b>opened</b> its gates to the public. In the meantime the project has appeared in several Hungarian professional journals, however these articles do not venture far beyond the realm of basic description. Here we are attempting to analyze the project architecturally. Our analysis shows how the initial usage of primary symbols turns to more contemplative, more abstract images and devices...|$|R
5000|$|Though the Oyapock Bridge {{was to be}} inaugurated {{in early}} 2012, it {{remained}} closed as the road on the Brazilian side was not completely paved. As of April 2013, the opening was scheduled {{for the end of}} 2013, but as of January 2015 the bridge <b>had</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> <b>opened</b> due to delays {{in the construction of the}} Brazilian customs facility, and no opening date was forecast. Another reason for the delayed opening of the bridge, as identified by Brazilian Senator João Capiberibe, was the lack of reciprocity pertaining to the visa requirements for Brazilian and French nationals entering each other's territory (French nationals could enter Brazil visa-free for up to 3 months, whereas Brazilian nationals had to obtain a visa to enter French Guiana, a requirement which was justified by the French government on the grounds of high levels of illegal immigration by Brazilians working as gold panners in French Guiana). In 2014, the Brazilian and French governments reached an agreement allowing residents of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana to apply for a local border crossing card, enabling them to visit each other's city visa-free for up to 72 hours (but not further inland). The arrangement came into effect on 1 January 2015 and, as of 1 October 2015, over 200 cards had been issued to Brazilian citizens resident in Oiapoque. According to the French government, the Brazilian government was 'largely satisfied' with this arrangement (though it fell short of full visa waiver reciprocity).|$|R
