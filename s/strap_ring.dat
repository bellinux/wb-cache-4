2500|$|The {{saxophone}} {{consists of}} an approximately conical tube, usually of thin brass, flared at the tip to form a bell. At intervals along the tube are between 20 and 23 tone holes of varying size and two very small vent holes to assist the playing of the upper register. These holes are covered by keys (also known as pad cups) containing soft leather pads, which are closed to produce an airtight seal. At rest some of the holes stand open and others are closed. The keys are activated by keytouches pressed by the fingers, either directly on the pad cup or connected to it with levers, either directly or with joints called [...] "linkages." [...] The right thumb sits under a thumb rest to stabilize and balance the saxophone, while the weight of most saxophones {{is supported by a}} neckstrap attached to a <b>strap</b> <b>ring</b> on the rear of the body of the instrument. The fingering for the saxophone is a combination of that of the oboe with the Boehm system and is very similar to the flute or upper register of the clarinet. Instruments that play to low A have a left thumb key for that note.|$|E
50|$|Harness {{boots were}} {{originally}} {{modeled on the}} square toed boots prevalent in the 19th century, including those worn by American Civil War soldiers. Leather <b>straps</b> and <b>rings</b> were added to this style in the 1960s, creating the modern version of the harness boot, which quickly became a classic.|$|R

50|$|Open-type TBMs have no shield, {{leaving the}} area behind the cutter head open for rock support. To advance, the machine uses a gripper system that pushes against the tunnel walls. Not all {{machines}} can be continuously steered while gripper shoes push on the walls, {{as with a}} Wirth machine, which only steers while ungripped. The machine will then push forward off the grippers gaining thrust. At {{the end of a}} stroke, the rear legs of the machine are lowered, the grippers and propel cylinders are retracted. The retraction of the propel cylinders repositions the gripper assembly for the next boring cycle. The grippers are extended, the rear legs lifted, and boring resumes. The open-type, or Main Beam, TBM does not install concrete segments behind with other machines. Instead, the rock is held up using ground support methods such as ring beams, rock bolts, shotcrete, steel <b>straps,</b> <b>ring</b> steel and wire mesh.|$|R

60|$|Just as I {{was getting}} ready to go to sleep I heard a jingle of harness and a grunt, and a mule passed me shaking his wet ears. He belonged to a screw-gun battery, for I could hear the rattle of the <b>straps</b> and <b>rings</b> and chains and things on his saddle pad. The screw-guns are tiny little cannon made in two pieces, that are screwed {{together}} when the time comes to use them. They are taken up mountains, anywhere that a mule can find a road, and they are very useful for fighting in rocky country.|$|R

5000|$|A lip strap is a {{piece of}} horse tack made of rolled leather or {{occasionally}} thin chain, used sometimes on some types of English-style curb and Pelham bits. The lip strap runs between the bit shanks and passes through a special center ring on a curb chain sometimes called the [...] "fly link."

50|$|Brassieres {{date from}} the early 1900s. At the initial stage, they are with the very simple design, made from two {{handkerchiefs}} and narrow <b>strap,</b> with no <b>ring</b> or slide for adjusting strap length. Later, slide {{was introduced to the}} brassiere for increasing or reducing the strap length. Found from the US patent document number 1,590,693 in year 1926, Elvira Campa McKeefrey put slides on straps. It is said the first bra with adjustable straps.|$|R

50|$|The Irish {{martingale}} {{is not a}} true martingale in {{the sense}} of a device that affects the rider's control over the horse. Thus, it is sometimes known as a semi-martingale. It is a simple short <b>strap</b> with a <b>ring</b> on either end. The reins are each run through a ring on either side before being buckled. The Irish martingale's purpose is not to control the head, but to prevent the reins from coming over the horse's head, risking entanglement, should a rider fall. It is used mostly in European horse racing.|$|R
40|$|Purpose : {{to develop}} a system of ski {{training}} exercises using a functional simulator at physical training lessons. Material : The study took 90 young men attended 10 class. To determine the level of formation of motor skills of pupils were tested on 7 indicators: skiing skating style 5 km; skiing classic style 3 km; pulling up on the bar; long jump with space, running 60 meters, running 3 miles, 4 x 9 meters shuttle run. A year after the first experiment was conducted a second experiment. Results : The developed and adapted to the physical education class simulator exercises which compounded the gravity load and moving <b>straps</b> with <b>rings.</b> The test results confirmed that the proposed method {{makes it possible to}} more effectively shape the motor skills of pupils in the process of ski training at physical training lessons. Conclusions : It is recommended to the lessons of physical training on use of ski training complex of 22 exercises that will most effectively influence the formation of motor skills of pupils...|$|R
5000|$|Curb chains or straps have {{no effect}} on a true snaffle because there is no {{leverage}} to act upon. English riders do not add any type of curb strap or curb chain to a snaffle bit. While some riders in western disciplines do add a curb <b>strap</b> to the <b>rings,</b> it is merely a [...] "hobble" [...] for the rings, has no leverage effect and is there only as a safety feature to prevent the rings from being pulled through the mouth of the horse, should the animal gape open its mouth in an attempt to avoid the bit, an outcome prevented in an English bridle by the presence of a cavesson noseband.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} an Arab strap is usually to sustain an {{erection}} and {{to stimulate the}} clitoris during coitus, or as a sex toy. In other words, this device in this case plays the double role of a cock ring and clitoris stimulator. In reality one more separate ring worn on the shaft is intended for additional stimulation the erogenous zones inside the partner's body. Some males suffering from erectile dysfunction who cannot maintain an erection for the needed period of time can make the erection longer and firmer with this device. In comparison with simple cock <b>rings,</b> <b>straps</b> hold the cock ring firmly in place, bind the testicles and penis shaft together and do not allow the ring to slide off during intercourse. The blood in the erected penis remains in the shaft until the cock ring is taken off. The firmer erection is said to result in greater sensitivity in the erect penises of those wearing the Arab Strap during the sexual stimulation.|$|R
5000|$|The harness {{supports}} the backplate and its cargo on the diver. It is formed from one continuous length of 2 in nylon webbing secured through dedicated {{top and bottom}} slots in the back plate. The webbing must be adjustable and is secured with a single stainless steel buckle located on the diver’s right waist, this position lessens the potential of accidental opening by the crotch strap. A crotch strap runs {{from the bottom of}} the back plate to a loop in front that the waist strap passes through, securing the harness/back plate system to the diver. The crotch strap prevents the harness system from shifting and riding high on the diver. The harness supports 5 “D” rings, one placed on the divers left waist, one on each shoulder strap, and two on the crotch strap. [...] The left side waist “D” ring is used to attach the back gas SPG, stage bottles, and other gear that may be required for a particular dive. The shoulder “D” rings are used for securing the backup lights, the primary regulator when not in use, and temporary storage of other pieces of equipment. The front crotch <b>strap</b> “D” <b>ring</b> is to be used solely for attachment to a DPV (scooter), and the rear “D” ring is used for attaching equipment as needed. The primary light battery canister is placed on the waist belt on the right, secured with a secondary stainless steel belt buckle or the primary belt buckle as best suits the size of canister and diver.|$|R
