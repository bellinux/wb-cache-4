50|$|The squat {{effect is}} the {{hydrodynamic}} phenomenon {{by which a}} vessel moving quickly through shallow water creates an area of lowered pressure that causes the ship {{to be closer to}} the seabed than would otherwise be expected. This phenomenon is caused when water that should normally flow under the hull encounters resistance due to the close proximity of the hull to the seabed. Leonardo's law causes the water to move faster in water level (where section is smaller); according Bernoullì's theorem, a velocity increasing determinates a low-pressure area so that ship is pulled down.

The machine vision method is proposed to extract wheel-soil boundary. Wheel-soil interaction image is processed into binary image, and the wheel-soil boundary is extracted according to its morphological features. The wheel <b>sinkage</b> depth, entrance angle and departure angle are calculated through the model of wheel <b>sinkage</b> calculation. The method’s applicability has been validated by experiments under various terrain conditions, which are flat terrain, raised terrain, hollow terrain, and rough terrain.

30|$|The <b>sinkage</b> of {{the wheel}} while {{traversing}} loose soil can be calculated by using the conventional terramechanics model [4]. When the weight {{of the wheel}} is given at first, the normal stress can be calculated as static condition (not dynamic condition). The entrance angle and the exit angle are given when the value between {{the weight of the}} wheel and force calculated by using the normal stress is equal [13]. However, there are some problems with that situation. The <b>sinkage</b> including the height of grousers is not contained in this calculation using the conventional terramechnics model. The <b>sinkage</b> is not known by the dynamic condition. The wheels for rovers have installed some grousers to get the effective driving force on loose soil. So, the <b>sinkage</b> including the height of grousers and the dynamic situation are needed to understand this. Some researchers have considered the running situation using wheel with “grousers”. Ding et al. and Sutoh studied the influence of grousers experimentally [14]–[16]. The <b>sinkage</b> is measured by using some extrinsic sensors, for instance motion capture and the rotary encoder and so on. This means that the wheel cannot calculate its own <b>sinkage</b> in time. From this problem, this paper suggests a wheel that can measure the <b>sinkage</b> directly.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Mobile robots are {{increasingly}} being used in highrisk rough terrain situations, such as planetary exploration and military applications. Current control and localization algorithms are not well suited to rough terrain, since they generally do not consider the physical characteristics of the vehicle and its environment. Little attention {{has been devoted to}} the study of the dynamic effects occurring at the wheel–terrain interface, such as slip and <b>sinkage.</b> These effects compromise odometry accuracy, traction performance, and may even result in entrapment and consequent mission failure. This paper describes methods for wheel slippage and <b>sinkage</b> detection aiming at improving vehicle mobility on soft sandy terrain. Novel measures for wheel slip detection are presented based on observing different onboard sensor modalities and defining deterministic conditions that indicate vehicle slippage. An innovative vision-based algorithm for wheel <b>sinkage</b> estimation is discussed based on edge detection strategy. Experimental results, obtained with a Mars rover-type robot operating in high-slippage sandy environments and with a wheel <b>sinkage</b> testbed, are presented to validate our approach.

40|$|When a ship is {{proceeding}} into the shallow water, ship’s <b>sinkage</b> and bow trim are increased. These tendencies become larger as the bottom clearance is decreased. This phenomenon is generally called as squat, and this sometimes makes the bottom touch or aground in harbour or fairway, and then caused the serious marine disaster {{such as oil}} prolusions. The researches of squat have been developed particularly in western countries where many canal and river water ways are provided. There are many methods for predicting the squat. However, the prediction methods that are mainly proposed based on potential theory are complicated and not sufficient in accuracy. In this paper, the simple prediction formula of bow squat is presented based on experimental model tests as well as theoretical approach.

Three levels of tractor ballast weights were used with a 4 -wheel drive tractor. The soil compaction variables measured in the rear tyre track were soil bulk density, cone penetration resistance, infiltration rate and tyre <b>sinkage.</b> The results indicated that increasing tractor tyre weight by using ballasting weights caused a significant increase in both soil bulk density and cone index through the soil layer. Among the different compaction treatments, the highest compaction treatment (full ballast) resulted in 22 % increase in soil bulk density at depths of 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm. The cone index was increased up to 102 % over the depth of 0 - 25 cm compared to untrafficked (control) treatment. All compaction treatments significantly reduced the initial infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration of the soil. However, the reduction in cumulative infiltration of soil under high compaction treatment reached up to 80 % compared to the control. Measurement of tyre <b>sinkage</b> differentiated between treatments. The greatest <b>sinkage</b> was observed under high compaction treatment providing 73 mm, whereas this value is equal to 1. 7 times <b>sinkage</b> of zero ballast treatment.

40|$|Accurate {{predictions}} of the resistance and running attitude are key steps {{in the process of}} hull design and manufacturing. The predictions have traditionally relied on model testing, but this technique is both expensive and time consuming. In this study, the performance of CFD simulations of planing hulls is evaluated using two commercial software: ANSYS FLUENT, developed by ANSYS, Inc., and STAR-CCM+, developed by CD-adapco. This was done by predicting the steady resistance, <b>sinkage</b> and trim angle of one semi-planing and one planing hull in calm, unrestricted water. The Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the SST k-! turbulence model was used along with the volume of fluid method to describe the two-phase flow of water and air around the hull. Furthermore, a two degrees of freedom solver was used together with dynamic mesh techniques to describe the fluid-structure interaction. The simulations were performed with both fixed and free <b>sinkage</b> and trim to make careful comparisons of the software and with experimental data. The results from the fixed <b>sinkage</b> and trim simulations of the planing hull in FLUENT and STAR-CCM+ show a good consistency. However, there is {{a significant difference in the}} pressure resistance obtained from the two codes that could not be explained. The free <b>sinkage</b> and trim simulations were mainly conducted in STAR-CCM+ due to problems with obtaining a stable solution in FLUENT.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} estimating in real-time {{the degree to which}} an articulated robotic vehicle is undergoing wheel slip andor <b>sinkage</b> in soft terrain. Robotic vehicles generally have hazard avoidance sensors which measure the shape of the sensible surface, and these can be used to predict what the articulation pose of the vehicle will be as it moves over the surface. An articulated vehicle (one with three or more wheels on each side) can directly measure the shape of the loadbearing surface by combining inclination and articulation sensing. Delays between the actual articulations and the expectations can be explained by wheel slippage. Differences between the expectation and the actual articulations can be explained by <b>sinkage</b> below the sensed surface. If one assumes that successive wheels on each side follow the same profile as the front wheel (sinking the same amount, if any, into the soil), then it is possible to estimate <b>sinkage</b> and slippage separately.

Experiments were conducted utilizing a single wheel-tester inside a soil bin. Penetration resistance and soil <b>sinkage</b> were determined as soil compaction indices. Data were examined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) at. % 1 significance level. Results indicated that the highest penetration resistance of 260 kPa occurred at a depth of 210 mm, third pass, wheel load of 3 kN and velocity of 0. 5 m/s. The lowest penetration resistance of 121 kPa was at 1 kN wheel load, first pass and at a velocity of 1 m/s.

40|$|A wheel {{experiencing}} <b>sinkage</b> and slippage events poses a {{high risk}} to rover missions as evidenced by recent mobility challenges on the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) project. Because several factors contribute to wheel <b>sinkage</b> and slippage conditions such as soil composition, large deformation soil behavior, wheel geometry, nonlinear contact forces, terrain irregularity, etc., there are significant benefits to modeling these events to a sufficient degree of complexity. For the purposes of modeling wheel <b>sinkage</b> and slippage at an engineering scale, meshfree finite element approaches enable simulations that capture sufficient detail of wheel-soil interaction while remaining computationally feasible. This study demonstrates some of the large deformation modeling capability of meshfree methods and the realistic solutions obtained by accounting for the soil material properties. A benchmark wheel-soil interaction problem is developed and analyzed using a specific class of meshfree methods called Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM). The benchmark problem is also analyzed using a commercially available finite element approach with Lagrangian meshing for comparison.
