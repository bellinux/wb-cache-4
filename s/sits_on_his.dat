5|$|As {{prescribed}} in the Jayakhya-Samhita, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti may be {{depicted as}} riding his vehicle (vahana) Garuda too, though {{these images are}} rarer. In this configuration, the god holds a sword, a lotus, a mace or a conch and the chakra. Generally, on four feathers of Garuda sit four female figures, two {{on either side of}} Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. The identity of the female figures is uncertain. They are interpreted as two goddesses (possibly consorts of Vishnu - Lakshmi and Bhumi) and two female attendants. The Jayakhya-Samhita mentions that four goddesses Lakshmi, Kirti, Jaya and Maya as the female counterparts of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Rarely, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is accompanied with his consort Lakshmi, who <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> left thigh. This form is called Lakshmi Vaikuntha in the Jayakhya-Samhita.|$|E
25|$|The east-facing {{pediment}} on {{the southern}} library shows Śiva seated on the summit of Mount Kailāsa, his mythological abode. His consort Umā <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> lap and clings anxiously to his torso. Other beings are also present {{on the slopes of}} the mountain, arranged in a strict hierarchy of three tiers from top to bottom. In the top tier sit bearded wise men and ascetics, in the middle tier mythological figures with the heads of animals and the bodies of humans, and in the bottom tier large animals, including a number of lions. In the middle of the scene stands the ten-headed demon king Rāvaṇa. He is shaking the mountain in its very foundations as the animals flee from his presence and as the wise men and mythological beings discuss the situation or pray. According to the legend, Śiva stopped Rāvaṇa from shaking the mountain by using his toe to press down on the mountain and to trap Rāvana underneath for 1000 years.|$|E

Alberti {{also noted that}} one of the security officer's use of the word [...] "pinko", a term used for a person who is regarded as sympathetic towards communism, is [...] "ironic" [...] as it was used by Bunker, whose chair Homer is sitting in.

2500|$|The Emperor Altoum, {{father of}} Turandot, <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> grand throne in his palace. Weary {{of having to}} judge his {{isolated}} daughter's sport, he urges the Prince to withdraw his challenge, but the Prince refuses (Aria – Altoum, the Prince: Un giuramento atroce – [...] "An atrocious oath"). Turandot enters and explains (In questa reggia – [...] "In this palace") that her ancestress of millennia past, Princess Lo-u-Ling, reigned over her kingdom [...] "in silence and joy, resisting the harsh domination of men" [...] until she was ravished and murdered by an invading foreign prince. Turandot claims that Lo-u-Ling now lives in her, and out of revenge, Turandot has sworn to never let any man wed her. She warns the Prince to withdraw but again he refuses. The Princess presents her first riddle: Straniero, ascolta! – [...] "What is born each night and dies each dawn?" [...] The Prince correctly replies, Speranza – [...] "Hope." [...] The Princess, unnerved, presents her second riddle (Guizza al pari di fiamma – [...] "What flickers red and warm like a flame, but is not fire?") The Prince {{thinks for a moment}} before replying, Sangue – [...] "Blood". Turandot is shaken. The crowd cheers the Prince, provoking Turandot's anger. She presents her third riddle (Gelo che ti da foco – [...] "What is ice which gives you fire and which your fire freezes still more?"). As the prince thinks, Turandot taunts him, [...] "What is the ice that makes you burn?" [...] The taunt makes him see the answer and he proclaims, [...] "It is Turandot! Turandot!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The name Christopher means [...] "Christ-bearer". [...] St Christopher {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular saints in the late medieval period and the cult based on him was derived from legends dating from the 5thcentury and later. [...] It is {{possible}} that there was a person called Christopher who was martyred between 249 and 251. [...] However, due to doubts about historical authenticity the cult came in for criticism during the Reformation. [...] The saint's late medieval popularity derived largely from a version of the story published in 1275 in the Golden Legend by Jacobus de Voragine, in which a giant named Christopher helped travellers across a dangerous river and, when he planted his staff in the riverbank, it burst into leaf. [...] In addition it was believed that seeing an image of the saint would protect from sudden death that day; this would have been particularly persuasive after the Black Death of 1348–49. [...] The statue at Norton Priory was [...] "created not as a work of art but as a practical working image with a religious purpose". [...] Images of StChristopher are found in three poses. [...] In the first pose the saint stands holding a staff in one hand and the Christ child in the other. [...] The second pose, that adopted by the Norton Priory statue, shows the saint with a staff in one hand; the other hand rests on his hip and the Christ child <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. [...] The third version shows the saint walking, holding the staff with both hands, and the Christ child either kneels behind his neck or sits with one leg on each side of his neck.|$|E
