25|$|Eurypterus {{belongs to}} the {{suborder}} Eurypterina, eurypterids in which the sixth appendage had developed a broad swimming paddle remarkably {{similar to that of}} the modern-day <b>swimming</b> <b>crab.</b> These appendages could only be moved in near-horizontal planes (i.e. they can not be bent much upwards or downwards). They are generally thought to utilize a rowing type of locomotion. The paddles are almost vertically oriented on the backward and down stroke, pushing the animal forward and lifting it up. They are then oriented horizontally on the recovery stroke to slash through the water without pushing the animal back. This type of swimming is exhibited by crabs and water beetles.|$|E
500|$|Encountered singly or in [...] "social" [...] groups, {{the common}} {{stingray}} appears to segregate by sex {{to some degree}} and may be more active at night, tending to bury itself in sediment during daytime. It feeds {{on a wide variety}} of bottom-dwelling organisms, including crustaceans, cephalopods, bivalves, polychaete worms, and small bony fishes. It is reportedly does great damage to cultured shellfish beds. One study in the Gulf of İskenderun off Turkey found that crustaceans comprised some 99% of its diet, with fish prey becoming increasingly important with age. Another study off the coast of Tarsus, Turkey, found the most important dietary component to be the penaeid shrimp Metapenaeus stebbingi, followed by the pistol shrimp Alpheus glaber and the <b>swimming</b> <b>crab</b> Charybdis longicollis; cephalopods were relatively important for males, while fishes were important for females. Common stingrays have been observed closely following each other in the presence of food, possibly to take advantage of other individuals' foraging success.|$|E

2500|$|Callinectes sapidus is a decapod crab of the <b>swimming</b> <b>crab</b> family Portunidae. The genus Callinectes is {{distinguished}} from other portunid crabs {{by the lack}} of an internal spine on the carpus (the middle segment of the claw), {{as well as by the}} T-shape of the male abdomen. Blue crabs may grow to a carapace width of [...] C.sapidus individuals exhibit sexual dimorphism. Males and females are easily distinguished by the shape of the abdomen (known as the [...] "apron") and by color differences in the chelipeds, or claws. The abdomen is long and slender in males, but wide and rounded in mature females. A popular mnemonic is that the male's apron is shaped like the Washington Monument, while the mature female's resembles the dome of the United States Capitol. Claw color differences are more subtle than apron shape. The immovable, fixed finger of the claws in males is blue with red tips, while females have orange coloration with purple tips. A female's abdomen changes as it matures: an immature female has a triangular-shaped abdomen, whereas a mature female's is rounded.|$|E

Here, we reveal a coincident {{increase in}} the abundance of <b>swimming</b> <b>crabs</b> and lesser black-backed gull colonies in the North Sea, both in time and in space. <b>Swimming</b> <b>crabs</b> are an important food source for lesser black-backed gulls during the breeding season. Inhabiting the land, but feeding mainly at sea, lesser black-backed gulls provide a link between marine and terrestrial ecosystems, since the bottom-up influence of allochthonous nutrient input from seabirds to coastal soils can structure the terrestrial food web. We, therefore, suggest that climate-driven changes in trophic interactions in the marine food web may also have ensuing ramifications for the coastal ecology of the North Sea...|$|R
