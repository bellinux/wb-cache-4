5000|$|Bargsten at once {{gave the}} order to dive, {{although}} he did not know the extent of the damage received. After a few <b>seconds,</b> the <b>Engineer</b> <b>Officer</b> reported that the boat was at 150 m. Bargsten told him that that was [...] "nonsense", but the Engineer insisted and called off further readings from the control room depth gauge: [...] "160 metres; 170 metres". The accuracy of the depth charges was devastating. Inside U-521, all instruments were shattered, all breakers blown and the diving planes and rudder were also disabled. Cold seawater was coming down the main hatch. Bargsten {{gave the order}} to dive for cover. After a few seconds, Oberleutnant (Ing.) Henning reported that they were sinking. She was already down to 150 m and dropping rapidly. Even though it did not make sense to Bargsten that the U-boat could plummet so quickly, he gave the order to blow all ballast. The main depth gauge must have been knocked out by the depth charges. Bargsten subsequently realised that the U-boat could not have descended to the depths called off by the <b>Engineer</b> <b>Officer</b> without becoming heavy by the bow or the stern, whereas she had kept an even keel throughout. Upon breaking the surface, Bargsten went to the bridge to make a topside estimate of the situation.|$|R

5000|$|Ministry of War Transport, Berkeley Square, W.1. 17th August, 1943.The KING {{has been}} graciously pleased {{to make the}} {{following}} award: —The Albert Medal.Gordon Love Bastian, Esq., M.B.E., <b>Second</b> <b>Engineer</b> <b>Officer,</b> Merchant Navy.The ship in which Mr. Bastian was serving was torpedoed and sustained severe damage. Mr. Bastian was on watch in the engine-room when the ship was struck. He at once shut off the engines. He then remembered that two firemen were on watch in the stokehold. The engine‑room was in darkness and water was already pouring into it. Although there was grave risk of disastrous flooding in opening the watertight door between the stokehold and engine‑room, Mr. Bastian did not hesitate but groped {{his way to the}} door and opened it. The two firemen were swept into the engine-room with the inrush of water. One man had a broken arm and injured feet and the other was badly bruised and shaken. Mr. Bastian made efforts to hold them both but lost one, so he dragged the other to the escape ladder and helped him on deck. He then returned for the other and helped him to safety. The more seriously injured man had practically to be lifted up the ladder by Mr. Bastian, who was himself half choked by cordite fumes.Second Engineer Officer Bastian took a very great risk in opening the watertight door into the already flooded and darkened engine-room of the sinking ship and both men undoubtedly owe their lives to his exceptional bravery, strength and presence of mind.|$|E
