25|$|In {{the face}} of <b>screen</b> <b>reader</b> software, braille usage has declined. However, because it teaches {{spelling}} and punctuation, braille education remains important for developing reading skills among {{blind and visually impaired}} children, and braille literacy correlates with higher employment rates.|$|E
25|$|Another type of <b>screen</b> <b>reader</b> is Apple VoiceOver. This {{software}} is provided {{free of charge}} on all Apple devices. Apple VoiceOver includes the option to magnify the screen, control the keyboard, and provide verbal descriptions to describe what is happening on the screen. There are thirty languages to select from. It also {{has the capacity to}} read aloud file content, as well as web pages, E-mail messages, and word processing files.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a cognitive {{perspective on the}} problem of using the Internet via <b>screen</b> <b>readers.</b> An empirical study shows similarities and dissimilarities between using the Internet via <b>screen</b> <b>readers</b> and via the standard graphical screen. In particular, spatial cognition is an important determinant of web task performance {{even in the absence of}} any visual cues. Backtracking behavior has a higher cost and impacts performance in a more negative way when using the Internet via <b>screen</b> <b>readers</b> as compared to the standard use. Selective reading can be used as an addition to the existing functionality of <b>screen</b> <b>readers</b> but more research is needed to prove the utility of such support mechanism. Computational cognitive modeling can be used in conceiving, testing and implementing cognitively informed support functionality in <b>screen</b> <b>readers...</b>|$|R
25|$|GNOME {{addresses}} computer accessibility {{issues by}} using the Accessibility Toolkit (ATK) application programming interface, which allows enhancing user experience by using special input methods and speech synthesis and speech recognition software. Particular utilities are registered with ATK using Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface (AT-SPI), and become globally used throughout the desktop. Several assistive technology providers, including Orca <b>screen</b> <b>reader</b> and Dasher input method, were developed specifically for use with GNOME.|$|E
25|$|Though Braille {{is thought}} to be the main way blind people read and write, in Britain (for example) out of the {{reported}} 2 million blind and low vision population, it is estimated that only around 15–20 thousand people use braille. Younger people are turning to electronic text on computers with <b>screen</b> <b>reader</b> software instead, a more portable communication method that they can use with their friends. A debate has started on how to make braille more attractive and for more teachers to be available to teach it.|$|E
500|$|Cortana can set reminders, {{recognize}} {{natural voice}} without {{the requirement for}} keyboard input, and answer questions using information from the Bing search engine (e.g., current weather and traffic conditions, sports scores, biographies). Searches will only be made with Microsoft Bing search engine and all links will open with Microsoft Edge, except when a <b>screen</b> <b>reader</b> such as Narrator is being used, where the links will open in Internet Explorer. [...] Windows 8.1's universal Bing SmartSearch features are incorporated into Cortana, which replaces the previous Bing Search app which was activated when a user presses the [...] "Search" [...] button on their device. Cortana includes a music recognition service. Cortana can simulate rolling dice and flipping a coin. 'Cortana's [...] "Concert Watch" [...] monitors Bing searches to determine which bands or musicians the user is interested in. It integrates with the Microsoft Band watch band for Windows Phone devices if connected via Bluetooth, it can make reminders and phone notifications.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>screen</b> <b>readers</b> {{allow the}} user to select whether most {{punctuation}} is announced or silently ignored. Some <b>screen</b> <b>readers</b> can be tailored to a particular application through scripting. One advantage of scripting {{is that it allows}} customizations to be shared among users, increasing accessibility for all. JAWS enjoys an active script-sharing community, for example.|$|R
2500|$|... tvOS {{includes}} the Apple technologies of VoiceOver, Zoom, and Siri {{to help the}} blind and those with impaired vision. VoiceOver, Apple's <b>screen</b> <b>reader,</b> is available in more than 30 languages and enables visually impaired users {{to know what is}} on the visual display and input responses to on-screen prompts. VoiceOver uses gestures similar to other Apple products (flicks, taps, and the rotor).|$|E
2500|$|IBM {{donated the}} Lotus Symphony {{codebase}} to the Apache Software Foundation in 2012, and Symphony was deprecated {{in favour of}} Apache OpenOffice. Many features and bug fixes, including a reworked sidebar, were merged. [...] The IAccessible2 <b>screen</b> <b>reader</b> support from Symphony was ported and included in the AOO 4.1 release (April 2014), although its first appearance in an open source software release was as part of LibreOffice 4.2 in January 2014. IBM ceased official participation by the release of AOO 4.1.1.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{provides}} data on {{the continued}} success of radiographers in reviewing mammograms with similar accuracy to <b>screen</b> <b>readers.</b> Method: The participants consisted of 7 radiographers and 2 current official <b>screen</b> <b>readers.</b> Two hundred and fifty sets of mammograms from 2003 were used in this study. Each participant reviewed each set of mammograms as a Rescreen or Recall. Patient outcomes were assessed by following up the results of any histology or pathology tests in 2003 or the 2005 / 2006 screening results. Results: The <b>screen</b> <b>reader’s</b> sensitivities ranged from 79 % to 93 % and the specificities ranged from 82 % to 84 %. The radiographer values ranged from 57 % to 97 % and 63 % to 80 % respectively. Conclusion: The sensitivity and specificity values attained by some radiographers were equivalent to those of both the <b>screen</b> <b>readers.</b> Accuracy rates of the radiographers suggest that screen reading by selected and appropriately trained radiographers should be achievable in Australia...|$|R

Apple Inc.'s macOS, iOS, and tvOS include VoiceOver, a feature-rich <b>screen</b> <b>reader,</b> while Google's Android provided Talkback <b>screen</b> <b>reader</b> since 2009. Similarly, Android-based devices from Amazon provide VoiceView <b>screen</b> <b>reader.</b> The console-based Oralux Linux distribution ships with three console screen-reading environments: Emacspeak, Yasr, and Speakup. BlackBerry 10 devices such as the BlackBerry Z30 include a built-in <b>screen</b> <b>reader.</b> There is also a free <b>screen</b> <b>reader</b> application for older less powerful BlackBerry (BBOS7 and earlier) devices.|$|E
