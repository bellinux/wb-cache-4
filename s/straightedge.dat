5|$|Lemoine's {{system of}} constructions, the Géométrographie, {{attempted}} {{to create a}} methodological system by which constructions could be judged. This system enabled a more direct process for simplifying existing constructions. In his description, he listed five main operations: placing a compass's end on a given point, placing it on a given line, drawing a circle with the compass placed upon the aforementioned point or line, placing a <b>straightedge</b> on a given line, and extending the line with the <b>straightedge.</b>|$|E
5|$|As well, he was {{not above}} {{publishing}} research in more elementary mathematics, such as the derivation of the set of polygons that can be constructed with compass, <b>straightedge,</b> and an angle trisector.|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} of two fields is {{expressed by the}} notion of a field extension. Galois theory, initiated by Evariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that angle trisection and squaring the circle can not be done with a compass and <b>straightedge.</b> Moreover, it shows that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable.|$|E

5|$|As {{described}} below, Apollonius' {{problem has}} ten special cases, {{depending on the}} nature of the three given objects, which may be a circle (C), line (L) or point (P). By custom, these ten cases are distinguished by three letter codes such as CCP. Viète solved all ten of these cases using only compass and <b>straightedge</b> constructions, and used the solutions of simpler cases to solve the more complex cases.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as a civil engineer, Lemoine wrote a {{treatise}} concerning compass and <b>straightedge</b> constructions entitled, La Géométrographie ou l'art des constructions géométriques, which he considered his greatest work, {{despite the fact that}} it was not well-received critically. The original title was De la mesure de la simplicité dans les sciences mathématiques, and the original idea for the text would have discussed the concepts Lemoine devised as concerning the entirety of mathematics. Time constraints, however, limited the scope of the paper. Instead of the original idea, Lemoine proposed a simplification of the construction process to a number of basic operations with the compass and <b>straightedge.</b> He presented this paper at a meeting of the Association Française in Oran, Algeria in 1888. The paper, however, did not garner much enthusiasm or interest among the mathematicians gathered there. Lemoine published several other papers on his construction system that same year, including Sur la mesure de la simplicité dans les constructions géométriques in the Comptes rendus of the Académie française. He published additional papers on the subject in Mathesis (1888), Journal des mathématiques élémentaires (1889), Nouvelles annales de mathématiques (1892), and the self-published La Géométrographie ou l'art des constructions géométriques, which was presented at the meeting of the Association Française in Pau (1892), and again at Besançon (1893) and Caen (1894).|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, Adriaan van Roomen {{solved the}} problem using {{intersecting}} hyperbolas, but this solution does not use only <b>straightedge</b> and compass constructions. François Viète found such a solution by exploiting limiting cases: {{any of the three}} given circles can be shrunk to zero radius (a point) or expanded to infinite radius (a line). Viète's approach, which uses simpler limiting cases to solve more complicated ones, is considered a plausible reconstruction of Apollonius' method. The method of van Roomen was simplified by Isaac Newton, who showed that Apollonius' problem is equivalent to finding a position from the differences of its distances to three known points. This has applications in navigation and positioning systems such as LORAN.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Worldwide, {{metallurgical}} rail welds {{are being}} geometrically {{assessed by the}} principle of vertical deviations satisfying given tolerances, measured with steel <b>straightedges</b> or occasion-ally with digital/electronic <b>straightedges.</b> In this approach, the geometrical shape of the weld in longitudinal direction has no real influence, although it has a direct relation with the dynamic wheel–rail interaction forces, which are responsible for track deterioration. In this article, differ-ent new assessment methods for rail welds are proposed and evaluated in practice, after which a choice is made for the best method. This is done {{in line with the}} situation in the Netherlands, where the chosen new method was recently introduced and standardized (2005). The proposed method is based on a limitation of the gradient of the discrete measurement signal, implying a limitation of the wheel–rail dynamic contact force...|$|R
5000|$|Some of {{the tools}} of manual {{drafting}} include pencils, pens and their ink, <b>straightedges,</b> T-squares, French curves, triangles, rulers, protractors, dividers, compasses, scales, erasers, and tacks or push pins. (Slide rules used to number among the supplies, too, but nowadays even manual drafting, when it occurs, benefits from a pocket calculator or its onscreen equivalent.) And of course the tools also include drawing boards (drafting boards) or tables. The English idiom [...] "to {{go back to the}} drawing board", which is a figurative phrase meaning to rethink something altogether, was inspired by the literal act of discovering design errors during production and returning to a drawing board to revise the engineering drawing. Drafting machines are devices that aid manual drafting by combining drawing boards, <b>straightedges,</b> pantographs, and other tools into one integrated drawing environment. CAD provides their virtual equivalents.|$|R

This disk edge wave {{turns out to be}} faster than the classic flexural acoustic wave in a <b>straightedged,</b> semi-infinite, thin plate, a wave which it mimics when the curvature radius becomes very large compared to the wavelength...|$|R
5|$|Later mathematicians {{introduced}} algebraic methods, which {{transform a}} geometric problem into algebraic equations. These methods were simplified by exploiting symmetries {{inherent in the}} problem of Apollonius: for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs, with one solution enclosing the given circles that the other excludes (Figure 2). Joseph Diaz Gergonne used this symmetry to provide an elegant <b>straightedge</b> and compass solution, while other mathematicians used geometrical transformations such as reflection in a circle to simplify {{the configuration of the}} given circles. These developments provide a geometrical setting for algebraic methods (using Lie sphere geometry) and a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different configurations of the given circles.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{methods can}} be used to enclose an {{arbitrary}} simple polygon within a curve of constant width, whose width equals the diameter of the given polygon. The resulting shape consists of circular arcs (at most as many as sides of the polygon), can be constructed algorithmically in linear time, and can be drawn with compass and <b>straightedge.</b> Although the regular-polygon based Reuleaux polygons all have an odd number of circular-arc sides, it is possible to construct constant-width shapes based on irregular polygons that have an even number of sides.|$|E
5|$|In {{the century}} from 1832 to Noether's death in 1935, {{the field of}} mathematics—specifically algebra—underwent a {{profound}} revolution, whose reverberations are still being felt. Mathematicians of previous centuries had worked on practical methods for solving specific types of equations, e.g., cubic, quartic, and quintic equations, {{as well as on}} the related problem of constructing regular polygons using compass and <b>straightedge.</b> Beginning with Carl Friedrich Gauss's 1832 proof that prime numbers such as five can be factored in Gaussian integers, Évariste Galois's introduction of permutation groups in 1832 (although, because of his death, his papers were published only in 1846 by Liouville), William Rowan Hamilton's discovery of quaternions in 1843, and Arthur Cayley's more modern definition of groups in 1854, research turned to determining the properties of ever-more-abstract systems defined by ever-more-universal rules. Noether's most important contributions to mathematics were to the development of this new field, abstract algebra.|$|E
40|$|TU Delft {{developed}} new geometrical {{standards for}} rail welds {{on behalf of}} the Dutch Rail Infra Manager ProRail. Previous standards were based on the principle of maximum vertical and horizontal tolerances, as is worldwide common practice. However, this approach does not account for the geometrical shape of the weld. In this way, the relation with the dynamic wheel-rail contact forces and stresses is disregarded, whereas these forces determine the rate of track deterioration. In this paper a theoretical model is presented to translate dynamic wheel-rail contact forces into the 1 st derivative of the weld geometry. Intervention values depending on the line section speed are presented. Measurement and simulation results show good correspondence with the theory. The new assessment method requires the application of digital <b>straightedges</b> instead of steel <b>straightedges,</b> in order to obtain the weld quality index according to the new standards. The governing algorithm is fast and easy to implement in a numerical code for the small processor of such a measuring device...|$|R
40|$|Students {{nowadays}} {{are relatively}} confident in directly applying geometrical theorems and theories. Nevertheless, {{it has been}} a common phenomenon that students are not confident in constructing geometric proofs. They lack the confidence and sufficient experience and knowledge in conducting deductive geometrical proofs. To some students, they treat proofs simply as another type of examination questions which they can tackle by repeated drillings. Students make use of <b>straightedges</b> and compasses to construct different geometry figures in geometric constructions. Through geometric constructions, we can train our prediction and logical thinking skills when investigating the properties of geometric figures. Geometric constructions provide students with hands-on experience to geometry learning which requires students to have more in-depth thinking. This is an empirical study on the implementation of geometric construction workshops among junior secondary students in Hong Kong. Results have shown that students enjoyed the construction tasks during the workshops. Analysis has implied that geometric constructions help improve students’ ability in constructing geometric proofs and to raise their interests in geometry learning. published_or_final_versionEducationMasterMaster of Educatio...|$|R

The drawing-board is set so that the draughtsman's chair has the window on its left hand. On the floor {{at the end of}} the table, on its right, is a ship's fire bucket. On the port side of the room, near the bookshelves, is a sofa with its back to the windows. It is a sturdy mahogany article, oddly upholstered in sailcloth, including the bolster, with a couple of blankets hanging over the back. Between the sofa and the drawing-table is a big wicker chair, with broad arms and a low sloping back, with its back to the light. A small but stout table of teak, with a round top and gate legs, stands against the port wall between the door and the bookcase. It is the only article in the room that suggests (not at all convincingly) a woman's hand in the furnishing. The uncarpeted floor of narrow boards is caulked and holystoned like a deck.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{evaluation of}} a method of measuring the straightness of motion of machine tool axes using a taut wire and an optical sensor head mounted at the tool point location. In contrast to commonly used taut wire instruments, <b>straightedges</b> or laser-based methods, this solution combines low cost, simplicity of setup and automated data capture while achieving {{state of the art}} accuracy suitable for application on precision machine tools. A series of tests are discussed which examine the performance of the new sensing head and different wires which highlight the suitability of the taut wire properties as a straightness reference. Experimental results obtained on a production machine tool are provided with respect to the accuracy and repeatability of both the proposed taut wire system and a laser interferometer operated under the same conditions. The reference errors of wires made of different materials are compared and the wire catenary is separated from the measurement results. The uncertainty budget for taut wire and laser systems is presented and expanded uncertainty of 4 μm obtained for both. During the experiment, the method showed excellent repeatability with two standard deviations of 1. 5 μm over a measuring range of 1. 5 m; this performance matches that of a commercial laser interferometer-based straightness reference to within 0. 1 μm...|$|R

25|$|Hippocrates and Menaechmus {{showed that}} {{the area of the}} cube could be doubled by finding the intersections of hyperbolas and parabolas, but these cannot be {{constructed}} by compass and <b>straightedge.</b> In the fifth century BCE, Hippias used a curve that he called a quadratrix to both trisect the general angle and square the circle, and Nicomedes in the second century BCE showed how to use a conchoid to trisect an arbitrary angle; but these methods also cannot be followed with just compass and <b>straightedge.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} of these problems, {{squaring}} the circle, otherwise known as the quadrature of the circle, involves constructing a square with the same area as a given circle using only <b>straightedge</b> and compass.|$|E
25|$|Squaring {{the circle}} is the problem, {{proposed}} by ancient geometers, of constructing a square {{with the same}} area as a given circle by using only {{a finite number of}} steps with compass and <b>straightedge.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{analytic}} geometry, the restriction of classical geometry to compass and <b>straightedge</b> constructions means a restriction to first- and second-order equations, e.g., y = 2x + 1 (a line), or x2 + y2 = 7 (a circle).|$|E
25|$|The <b>straightedge</b> is {{infinitely}} long, {{but it has}} no {{markings on}} it and has only one straight edge, unlike ordinary rulers. It can only be used {{to draw a line}} segment between two points or to extend an existing segment.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greek mathematicians {{knew how}} to bisect an angle (divide it into two angles of equal measure) using only a compass and <b>straightedge,</b> but could only trisect certain angles. In 1837 Pierre Wantzel showed that for most angles this {{construction}} cannot be performed.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} {{existing}} proofs of impossibility, some persist {{in trying to}} solve these problems.

25|$|The ancient Greek mathematicians {{knew how}} to use compass and <b>straightedge</b> to {{construct}} a length equal to the square root of a given length. In 1837 Pierre Wantzel proved that an nth root of a given length cannot be constructed if n is not a power of 2.|$|E
25|$|Leading {{up to this}} period, geometers {{also tried}} to {{determine}} what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry. For example, the problem of trisecting an angle with a compass and <b>straightedge</b> is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that {{can be carried out}} with those tools. However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until Pierre Wantzel published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible. Other constructions that were proved impossible include doubling the cube and squaring the circle. In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates {{from the fact that the}} compass and <b>straightedge</b> method involve equations whose order is an integral power of two, while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.|$|E
