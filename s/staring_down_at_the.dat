500|$|Batman conveys {{trademarks}} {{found in}} 1930s pulp magazines, notably {{the design of}} Gotham City stylized with Art Deco design. Richard Corliss, writing for Time, observed that Gotham's design was a reference to films such as Metropolis (1927) and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920). [...] "Gotham City, despite being shot on a studio backlot", he continued, [...] "is literally another character in the script. It has the demeaning presence of German Expressionism and fascist architecture, <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> citizens." [...] Hanke further addressed the notions of Batman being a period piece, in that [...] "The citizens, cops, people and the black-and-white television looks like it takes place in 1939"; but later said: [...] "Had the filmmakers made Vicki Vale a femme fatale rather than a damsel in distress, this could have made Batman as a homage and tribute to classic film noir." [...] Portions of the climax pay homage to Vertigo.|$|E

60|$|Kramer {{sat for a}} time, <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> metal floor under him. The floor throbbed dully {{with the}} motion of the turbines. At last he looked up.|$|E
60|$|Clad in sea-boots, {{oilskins}} and sou'wester, I had {{for some}} time been hanging upon <b>the</b> rail <b>at</b> <b>the</b> break of <b>the</b> poop, <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> fascinated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> poor devils of sailors, repeatedly up to their necks in water, or submerged, or dashed like straws about the deck, while they pulled and hauled, stupidly, blindly, and in evident fear, under the orders of Mr. Pike.|$|R
6000|$|Conger {{went over}} to the table, pushing past them. He bent <b>down,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bones. [...] "So these are his remains," [...] he murmured. [...] "The Founder. The Church has hidden them for two centuries." ...|$|R
60|$|After he {{had left}} the Squire's office, Hiram stood for a while in the street, bareheaded, his hat in his hand, <b>staring</b> unwinkingly <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>at</b> his feet, with stupidly {{drooping}} lips and lackluster eyes. Presently he raised his hand and began slowly smoothing down the sandy shock of hair upon his forehead. At last he aroused himself with a shake, looked dully up and down the street, and then, putting on his hat, turned and walked slowly and heavily away.|$|R
60|$|She {{shook her}} head without replying. She had averted her face, {{and her eyes were}} <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> gently heaving water. After a moment she spoke, her voice steady and {{perfectly}} controlled.|$|E
6000|$|The agent {{tapped his}} {{leggings}} with a riding-cane. [...] "So you've been expecting it!" [...] {{he said with}} relief. [...] "That's right." [...] And, <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mother-child, he added: [...] "Well, what d'you say, my dear; you look full of sense, you do!" ...|$|E
60|$|For a while I stood amazed with horror, <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dead face of {{my beloved}} mother. Then I stooped {{to lift her}} and saw {{that she had been}} stabbed, and through the breast, stabbed with the sword which I carried in my hand.|$|E
50|$|In the night, Lily sees many bees in {{her room}} and tells her father but T-Ray yells at her {{to go back to}} bed. The next night, Lily runs into their peach orchard and digs up a box {{containing}} several of her mother's possessions. Lily lies <b>down,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stars and talking to her mother's spirit, but she hears her father calling. He accosts her, and takes her home and punishes her.|$|R
6000|$|There {{must have}} been some glare in the air to {{interfere}} with one's sight, because it was only just before the sun left us that my roaming eyes made out beyond the highest ridge of the principal islet of the group something which did away with the solemnity of perfect solitude. The tide of darkness flowed on swiftly; and with tropical suddenness a swarm of stars came out above the shadowy earth, while I lingered yet, my hand resting lightly on my ship's rail as if on the shoulder of a trusted friend. But, with all that multitude of celestial bodies <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> one, <b>the</b> comfort of quiet communion with her was gone for good. And there were also disturbing sounds by this time--voices, footsteps forward; the steward flitted along the maindeck, a busily ministering spirit; a hand-bell tinkled urgently under the poop-deck. [...] .|$|R
60|$|Westover {{looked up}} toward the Durgin house with a return of {{interest}} in the canvas he had left in the lane on the easel. Nothing had happened to it. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> door of the barn he saw the farmer and his eldest son slanting forward and <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> hill <b>at</b> <b>the</b> point he had come from. Mrs. Durgin was looking out from the shelter of the porch, and she turned and went in with Jeff's dog at her skirts when Westover came in sight with the children.|$|R
60|$|By now Bastin {{had joined}} us, and, {{attracted}} by my exclamation {{and by the}} attitude of Bickley, who was <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> coffin with a fixed look upon his face, not unlike that of a pointer when he scents game, he began to contemplate the wonder within it in his slow way.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Alleyne {{stood in the}} window, still <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> silent forest, {{uncertain}} as to what he should think of these midnight walkers. Then he bethought him that there was one beside him who was fitter to judge on such a matter. His fingers had scarce rested upon Aylward's shoulder ere the bowman was on his feet, with his hand outstretched to his sword.|$|E
60|$|Our poor Harry {{had never}} before beheld a man killed thus in an instant who a moment before had been so full of life and activity, for when Captain Morgan turned the body over upon its back he could {{perceive}} at a glance, little as he knew of such matters, {{that the man was}} stone dead. And, indeed, it was a dreadful sight for him who was hardly more than a child. He stood rooted for he knew not how long, <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dead face with twitching fingers and shuddering limbs. Meantime a great crowd was gathering about them again.|$|E
6000|$|He {{slapped his}} thighs smartly, walked with small steps {{this way and}} that, seized a chair, planted it with a bang before Lingard, and sat <b>down</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old seaman with haggard eyes. Lingard, {{returning}} his stare steadily, dived slowly into various pockets, fished out at last a box of matches and proceeded to light his cheroot carefully, rolling it round and round between his lips, without taking his gaze for a moment off the distressed Almayer. Then from behind a cloud of tobacco smoke he said calmly-- ...|$|R
60|$|They were in {{the shadow}} of the yacht and coming {{alongside}} her ladder. The master of the brig looked upward into the face of a gentleman, with long whiskers and a shaved chin, <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> him over <b>the</b> side through a single eyeglass. As he put his foot on the bottom step he could see the shore smoke still ascending, unceasing and thick; but even as he looked the very base of the black pillar rose above the ragged line of tree-tops. The whole thing floated clear away from the earth, and rolling itself into an irregularly shaped mass, drifted out to seaward, travelling slowly over the blue heavens, like a threatening and lonely cloud.|$|R
60|$|The cliff {{behind the}} palace {{rose to a}} height of about {{a hundred and fifty}} feet, and, as it chanced, just there a portion of it jutted out in an oblong shape, which the Abati called the Lion Rock, {{although}} personally, heretofore, I {{had never been able to}} see in it any great resemblance to a lion. Now, however, it was different, for on the very extremity of this rock, <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Mur, sat <b>the</b> head and neck of the huge lion-faced idol of the Fung. Indeed, in that light, with the promontory stretching away behind it, it looked as though it were the idol itself, moved from the valley upon the farther side of the precipice to the top of the cliff above.|$|R
60|$|She was lovely, very lovely, {{with long}} dark hair that wound around her {{shoulders}} and arms. Her body was slim, very slender, with a supple grace to it that made him stare, accustomed as he was to various forms of anatomy. How silent she was! Silent and unmoving, <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> water. Time passed, strange, unchanging time, {{as he watched the}} girl. Time might even have ceased, with the girl sitting on the rock staring into the water, and the rows of great ferns behind her, as rigid {{as if they had been}} painted there.|$|E
60|$|There he stood, {{with his}} feet a little apart, his back to a big corner gin palace that towered twice his height and ended In a sky sign, <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pigmies and wondering--trying, I doubt not, to collate it all with the other things of his life, with the valley among the downlands, the nocturnal lovers, the singing in the church, the chalk he {{hammered}} daily, and with instinct and death and the sky, trying {{to see it all}} together coherent and significant. His brows were knit. He put up his huge paw to scratch his coarse hair, and groaned aloud.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't touch him! He {{is going}} to show off," [...] said Nat, {{displaying}} his new pet with great pride. First he put a cocked hat on the bird's head, and the boys laughed at the funny effect; then he added a pair of paper spectacles, and that gave the owl such a wise look that they shouted with merriment. The performance closed with making the bird angry, and seeing him cling to a handkerchief upside down, pecking and [...] "clucking," [...] as Rob called it. He was allowed to fly after that, and settled himself on the bunch of pine-cones over the door, where he sat <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> company with an air of sleepy dignity that amused them very much.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> them. <b>The</b> boys have already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay <b>at</b> least for <b>the</b> free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is brought out to them and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|R
60|$|Thus, then, {{were these}} two young persons occupied--Gideon attacking the perfect number with resolution; Julia vigorously {{stippling}} incongruous colours on her block, when Providence despatched into these waters a steam-launch asthmatically panting up the Thames. All {{along the banks}} the water swelled and fell, and the reeds rustled. The houseboat itself, that ancient stationary creature, became suddenly imbued with life, and rolled briskly at her moorings, like a sea-going ship when she begins to smell the harbour bar. The wash had nearly died away, and the quick panting of the launch sounded already faint and far off, when Gideon was startled by a cry from Julia. Peering through the window, he beheld her <b>staring</b> disconsolately <b>down</b> stream <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fast-vanishing canoe. The barrister (whatever were his faults) displayed on this occasion a promptitude worthy of his hero, Robert Skill; with one effort of his mind he foresaw {{what was about to}} follow; with one movement of his body he dropped to the floor and crawled under the table.|$|R
50|$|BESCO tasked its company {{police force}} on June 10 with {{protecting}} 30 company workers {{to return to}} Waterford Lake and continue its plan to restart the water and electricity to its facilities which ran the mine pumps and once again cut off water to the families living in the town. The following morning on June 11, the company police began a patrol pattern of intimidation which led to small clashes throughout town, culminating in a protest by 700 to 3,000 striking miners who marched on the Waterford Lake pumping station and power plant {{in an attempt to}} persuade the company workers to support the strike. The company police were <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> miners <b>at</b> <b>the</b> plant gates <b>at</b> 11:00 AM when the police charged the crowd, firing over 300 shots and injuring many in the crowd. One police officer shot deliberately at Davis, piercing his heart and killing him instantly. The company police force then retreated as the miners swarmed the facility. After the murder of Bill Davis, the striking miners took the murderous Coal Company Security force to the local jail to face charges, rather than submit them to summary justice. They likely understood that the security force was just as enslaved to the corporation as the miners. This understanding of the actions of that day sustains Davis Days, the day that the people of New Waterford showed their true spirit.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is because, my dear, {{you don't}} care {{the ghost of}} a straw for either. That one--he was worn out long ago, and we never knew it. I know it now. Time and the sheer going-on of day by day, without either of us {{guessing}} at it, wore that down till it had no more meaning for you or me than any other faded remembrance in this interminable footling with truth that we call life. And this one--the whole abject meaning of it lies simply in {{the fact that it has}} pierced down and shown us up. I had no courage. I couldn't see how feeble a hold I had on life--just one's friends' opinions. It was all at second hand. What I want to know now is--leave me out; don't think, or care, or regard my living-on one shadow of an iota--all I ask is, What am I to do for you?' He turned away and stood <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cinders in the fireless grate.|$|E
6000|$|A {{little before}} evening Thumb {{suddenly}} stopped, and stood listening. They {{went on a}} little farther, and again he stood still, with lifted head, snuffing the air. And soon they all heard plainly {{the sound of a}} great river. In the last light of sunset the travellers broke out of the forest and looked down on the waters of the deep and swollen Obea-munza. Along its banks grew giant sedge, stiff and grey with frost like meal. In this sedge little birds were disporting themselves, flitting and twittering, with long plumes of every colour that changes in the sunlight, brushing off with their tiny wings the gathered hoarfrost into the still sunset air. The Mulgars stood like painted wooden images, with their bundles and cudgels, <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> river, wide and turbulent, its gloomy hummocks of ice and frozen snow nodding down upon the pale green waters. They glanced at one another as if with the question on their faces, [...] "How now, O Mulla-mulgars?" ...|$|E

50|$|President Kennedy's iconic stance <b>staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{table in}} front of him is all the more {{fascinating}} insofar as Kennedy was actually reading a copy of Tames' paper, The New York Times. Tames recalled later that Kennedy was reading a column by editorial columnist Arthur Krock on the {{table in front}} of him by the window of the Oval Office.|$|E
5000|$|According to Publishers Weekly, {{the novel}} falters: [...] "For all the debauchery that is Carnival (think Scotch, marijuana, fireworks, jouvert bands), {{this section of}} the novel feels curiously bloodless, perhaps because Antoni's style tends toward short {{fragments}} ("He sat up, arms folded over chest. Breathing quickly. His chest rising, falling. <b>Staring</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground") and weak transitions ("Before I had a chance to think about it..."; [...] "Before I knew it..."; etc.) The final act of the novel shifts to a remote, mountainous region where William and friends intend to sober up from the merrymaking, but instead find themselves involved in a violent incident involving the Earth People (an isolated settlement of rastas) and a racist police force. Antoni's major themes—race (William is white, Laurence black, Rachel French-Creole) and sexuality—are good ones, but they're not sufficiently developed, and the plot feels somewhat manufactured".|$|E
