Alford (another Milo) carried on his back for a wager four bushels salt-water measure, all the length thereof;" [...] or that the bridge is a veritable esquire, bearing arms of its own (a ship and bridge proper on a plain field), and owning lands and tenements in many parishes, with which the said miraculous bridge has, from time to time, founded charities, built schools, waged suits at law, and finally (for this concerns us most) given yearly dinners, and kept for that purpose (luxurious and liquorish bridge that it was) the best <b>stocked</b> <b>cellar</b> of wines in all Devon.|$|R

He said that all his wines were pure, and were each the best of their type. He had never served a wine under a false name. Bignon kept his prices high. When questioned about this, he said that it was in the interests of his clientele, since the high prices kept out the vulgar and ensured an atmosphere of quiet intimacy.|$|R

2500|$|The Winter Palace's wine cellars {{literally}} fuelled {{the weeks}} of looting and unrest {{in the city}} which followed. Arguably the largest and best <b>stocked</b> wine <b>cellar</b> in history, it contained the world's finest vintages, including the Tsar's favourite, and priceless, Chateau d’Yquem 1847. So keen were the mob to obtain the alcohol, that the Bolsheviks explored radical solutions to the problem, one of which involved piping the wine straight out into the Neva. This led to crowds clustering around the palace drains. Another proposal, deemed too risky, was exploding the cellars. Eventually, the problem was solved by the declaration of martial law.

5000|$|St Paul's is one {{of three}} colleges within Sydney University to have its own fully {{licensed}} bar. The Salisbury Bar usually opens Sunday to Thursday from 8 pm. Each year the bar is run by a student group committed to the legacy of alumnus Charles Salisbury, whose donation created the service; according to legend, Salisbury set a condition requiring the establishment of a bar for the residents. He reportedly declared that [...] "no man should have to walk more than 50 metres for a beer". St Paul's has a fully <b>stocked</b> wine <b>cellar</b> (providing members of the college with reduced-price entry-level wines) and a large collection of stored vintages.

5000|$|Government {{workers were}} {{employed}} at Agency {{as early as}} 1813, and Colonel Ward was in charge. Ward's house fronted {{the north side of}} Robinson Road, and consisted of two large rooms made of hewn logs. The cellar was made of brick, and was described as a [...] "dungeon" [...] used to confine fugitive slaves. Slaves who fled plantations in Mississippi and Alabama would seek asylum with the Choctaw people. The Choctaw, themselves slave owners, would deliver the fugitives to Colonel Ward, who would lock them in <b>stocks</b> in his <b>cellar.</b> The early settlement also had a storehouse, blacksmith shop, and stables.|$|R

The <b>cellar</b> <b>stocks</b> some 250,000 bottles including 300 varieties of French wine. A notable wine store Vinissimo is located on the Rue de Bord de Mer in Gustavia and stocks around 400,000 bottles of wine.

5000|$|At {{the far end}} of {{the estate}} were the old stables that the Hon. Cecilia de Trafford {{transformed}} into a pottery for the employment of local artists and the production of authentic Maltese potterware. The origin of the pottery harks back to a pottery run by family friend Count Giuseppe Teuma Castelletti before World War II. During the war, the Count stored his <b>stock</b> in the <b>cellar</b> at Villa Bologna, which was lucky indeed since his pottery, then at a now forgotten location at Ta’ Qali, was hit by a bomb. Then, in 1951, it occurred to Cecilia, Gerald’s mother, to set up a pottery in the old stables to continue the work of Count Giuseppe Teuma Castelletti.|$|R

Snow or no snow, Treasury Secretary John Stone is not one to waste a moment in keeping his Treasurer up to speed.

5000|$|In January 2017, Makowsky {{listed a}} Bel Air mansion $250 million, the most {{expensive}} home listed on the American market at the time. Previously, the highest recorded sale price in the area was $100 million for two homes sold in 2016 including the Playboy Mansion, and a home in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles which was listed for $150 million. The most expensive listing, previous to Makowsky's mansion, was a $195 million mansion in Manalapan, Florida. Developed by Makowsky's BAM Luxury Development team, Makowsky said his inspiration came from megayachts. He wanted his creation to be [...] "the ultimate megayacht, but on land." [...] The 38,000 square-foot house has four floors, 12 bedrooms, 21 bathrooms, and three kitchens. It also features a 40-seat James Bond themed movie theater an infinity pool with swim-up bar and two <b>stocked</b> wine <b>cellars.</b> Inside the house, Makowsky has added 130 artworks including a helicopter on the roof {{which appeared in the}} 1980s television series Airwolf, and a Hobie Cat sailboat on a deck. The home includes a 12 car [...] "auto gallery," [...] including a limited edition Bugatti Veyron, a Pagani Huayra, a 1936 Mercedes-Benz 540K, and a Rolls-Royce Dawn. The home took over four years to build and furnish. The mansion was built on a 1.2-acre lot which Makowsky bought from New York Giants football player Michael Strahan in 2013. The listing is through Hilton & Hyland and Ben Bacal of Rodeo Realty by agents Branden and Rayni Williams.|$|R
50|$|The City of Paris {{maintained}} {{a connection with}} French culture reflected in the store's décor and merchandise. The Verdier <b>Cellars</b> <b>stocked</b> many fine French vintages and was the most extensive wine department of any American department store. At the time of Prohibition, the lower level of the store was redesigned as a French village and named Normandy Lane. This concept was borrowed by the across the street neighbor Macy's California where the store's lower level was similarly transformed and named Macy's Cellar. Macy's Cellar was later installed in other Macy divisions' locations. In 1961 when Julia Child and Simone Beck were promoting their just published Mastering the Art of French Cooking, they spent an entire day at the store doing cooking demonstrations. The bookseller Brentano's opened a branch within the City of Paris store; it became the largest bookstore west of Denver. The City of Paris had multiple branch stores in the San Francisco Bay Area.|$|R
50|$|The cellar {{is managed}} {{day to day}} by the Government Butler and is overseen {{by the head of}} Government Hospitality coming under the {{jurisdiction}} of the Foreign Office. It was previously stocked on the advice of the Government Hospitality Advisory Committee for the Purchase of Wine but is now stocked according to recommendations from a specialist committee of Masters of Wine, chaired by a former diplomat. The committee meets two or three times a year in the cellar, around a table carved from an elm tree that blew down in St James's Park in around 1830. The role of the committee is to taste the wines, make recommendations for new purchases to keep the <b>cellar</b> <b>stocked,</b> and to sell a portion on the open market to fund the restocking process. They also grade the wines and offer serving suggestions. Aside from the committee and the Government Butler, access to the cellar is strictly limited to Permanent Secretaries and Ministers.|$|R

Matt helps Evan and Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) chaperon the Year 12 camping trip. Tad Reeves (Jonathon Dutton) smuggles in a bottle of whiskey and shares it with the other teens.

50|$|Monville {{was arrested}} on May 17, 1794, imprisoned in the Conciergerie, and found guilty by a Revolutionary Tribunal. Accounts of his captivity vary, one stating he was held at “maison d'arrêt“ on the Rue de la Loi, another at the “maison Talaru“. He was {{released}} on August 5, 1794, eight days after Robespierre's execution, which {{marked the end of}} the Terror. In compromised health, he died on March 8, 1797, while residing at 64, rue du Faubourg-Saint-Honoré in Paris. Cause of death was an abscessed gum. Death occurred four days after dental surgery. Monville died a wealthy man, leaving a considerable estate that required almost two months to inventory, from March 14 to May 6, 1797; this Inventaire après le Décès de Racine de Monville, of more than 100 pages, can be consulted in the French National Archives a Pierrefitte-sur-Seine.. The noteworthy items Monville possessed at his death included a vicuña jacket, a harp, two violins, a quinte, 180 lots of books and a wine <b>cellar</b> <b>stocked</b> with more than 750 bottles and half-bottles.|$|R
60|$|I {{see that}} some remarks by the Rev. R. J. Campbell, dealing with social {{conditions}} in America, {{are reported in}} the press. They include some observations about Sinn Fein in which, as in most of Mr. Campbell's allusions to Ireland, {{it is not difficult}} to detect his dismal origin, or the acrid smell of the smoke of Belfast. But the remarks about America are valuable in the objective sense, over and above their philosophy. He believes that Prohibition will survive and be a success, nor does he seem himself to regard the prospect with any special disfavour. But he frankly and freely testifies to the truth I have asserted; that Prohibition does not prohibit, so far as the wealthy are concerned. He testifies to constantly seeing wine on the table, as will any other grateful guest of the generous hospitality of America; and he implies humorously that he asked no questions about the story told him of the old <b>stocks</b> in the <b>cellars.</b> So there is no dispute about the facts; and we come back as before to the principles. Is Mr. Campbell content with a Prohibition which is another name for Privilege? If so, he has simply absorbed along with his new theology a new morality which is different from mine. But he does state both sides of the inequality with equal logic and clearness; and in these days of intellectual fog that alone is like a ray of sunshine.|$|R
60|$|We had orchards, meadows, and {{ploughed}} fields {{all around}} us; while the barns, granaries, styes, and other {{buildings of the}} farm, were of solid stone, like the dwelling, and all in capital condition. In addition to the place, which he inherited from my grandfather, quite without any encumbrance, well stocked and supplied with utensils of all sorts, my father had managed to bring with him from sea some fourteen or fifteen thousand dollars, which he carefully invested in mortgages in the county. He got twenty-seven hundred pounds currency with my mother, similarly bestowed; and, two or three great landed proprietors, and as many retired merchants from York, excepted, Captain Wallingford was generally supposed {{to be one of}} the stiffest men in Ulster county. I do not know exactly how true was this report; though I never saw anything but the abundance of a better sort of American farm under the paternal roof, and I know that the poor were never sent away empty-handed. It as true that our wine was made of currants; but it was delicious, and there was always a sufficient <b>stock</b> in the <b>cellar</b> to enable us to drink it three or four years old. My father, however, had a small private collection of his own, out of which he would occasionally produce a bottle; and I remember to have heard Governor George Clinton, afterwards, Vice President, who was an Ulster county man, and who sometimes stopped at Clawbonny in passing, say that it was excellent East India Madeira. As for clarets, burgundy, hock and champagne, they were wines then unknown in America, except on the tables of some of the principal merchants, and, here and there, on that of some travelled gentleman of an estate larger than common. When I say that Governor George Clinton used to stop occasionally, and taste my father's Madeira, I do not wish to boast of being classed with those who then composed the gentry of the state. To this, in that day, we could hardly aspire, though the substantial hereditary property of my family gave us a local consideration that placed us a good deal above the station of ordinary yeomen. Had we lived in one of the large towns, our association would unquestionably have been with those who are usually considered to be one or two degrees beneath the highest class. These distinctions were much more marked, immediately after the war of the revolution, than they are to-day; and they are more marked to-day, even, than all but the most lucky, or the most meritorious, whichever fortune dignifies, are willing to allow.|$|R
40|$|The Van Buren administration's record, {{particularly}} with regard to the handling of public finances, is condemned as corrupt and a perpetuation of unpopular Jacksonian policies. The artist echoes perennial Whig charges of the Democrats' disregard for the Constitution and their autocratic style of governing. The nursery rhyme theme of "The House that Jack built" employed here was also used in several earlier cartoons. (See nos. 1820 - 1 and 1833 - 6.) Murrell also reproduces an earlier and somewhat similar E. W. Clay version of the "House that Jack built," probably dating from the bank wars of around 1834. Here, the "House" is Jackson's subtreasury system, represented above by a banking house interior whose floor rests on "Constitutional Currency," and whose <b>cellar</b> <b>stocked</b> with empty boxes. The scene appears in a cloud of smoke, which comes from the pipes of Andrew Jackson (on the left) and advisor and publicist Amos Kendall (on the right). Kendall's pipe also blows bubbles, symbolizing vanity or idle schemes. Nine verses from the nursery rhyme and corresponding satirical scenes appear below. 1. "This is the Malt that laid in the House that Jack built. " The scene shows crates labeled "Post Office Revenue," "Public Land Sales," "Custom House," "Bonds," and "Pension Fund," suggestive of administration graft and intrigues in a cellar. 2. "This is the Rat that eat the Malt... " shows Van Buren's Treasury Secretary Levi Woodbury as a rat. 3. "This is the Cat that caught the Rat... " shows Daniel Webster as a cat toying with Woodbury. 4. "This is the Dog That worried the Cat,... " has Thomas Hart Benton as a dog threatening the cat Webster, who is now standing on a book "Constitution" atop a chair. 5. "This is the Cow, Whit the crumpled Horn, That tossed the Dog... " shows Henry Clay as a cow tossing Benton aloft. 6. "This is the Maiden all forlorn, That milked the Cow,... " John C. Calhoun as a milkmaid laments over a spilled bucket "Nullification" as the cow runs away with a sheet marked "Tariff. " The reference is to Calhoun's role in the nullification crisis of 1832 - 33, and Clay's compromise tariff which temporarily resolved the conflict. 7. "This is the Man, all tattered and torn, That kissed the Maiden... " has Martin Van Buren in old Dutch clothing, wheeling a barrow of cabbages, saying "Here's your fine Kinderhook Early York Kabbitches. " (Van Buren's home was in Kinderhook, New York.) 8. "This is the Priest all shaven and shorn, That married the Man... " Washington "Globe" editor Francis Preston Blair in liturgical vestment presides over the wedding of Calhoun and Van Buren, ridiculing the unlikely political alliance forged in 1840. 9. "This is the Cock of the walk, that crowed in the morn, That waked the Priest all shaven and shorn,... " A rooster with the head of William Henry Harrison stands on a globe "Ohio" as the sun rises behind it. Davison lists a version of the print with the Childs address at 90 Nassau Street.
