5|$|Animal {{entertainments}} {{formed a}} central part of the games and normally took place in the morning. Dio says that {{over the course of the}} inaugural games upward of nine thousand tamed and wild animals were slain <b>sometimes</b> <b>by</b> women of no particular prominence. This conflicts with the work of Eutropius who wrote, in the later part of the fourth century, that 5,000 animals were slain during the games.|$|E

5|$|The Palace Museum holds 340,000 {{pieces of}} {{ceramics}} and porcelain. These include imperial collections from the Tang dynasty and the Song dynasty, {{as well as}} pieces commissioned by the Palace, and, <b>sometimes,</b> <b>by</b> the Emperor personally. The Palace Museum holds about 320,000 pieces of porcelain from the imperial collection. The rest are almost all held in the National Palace Museum in Taipei and the Nanjing Museum.|$|E
5|$|The active visual {{warnings}} {{are usually}} {{in the form of}} flashing lights. These flash in order {{to attract the attention of}} other road users as the ambulance approaches, or to provide warning to motorists approaching a stopped ambulance in a dangerous position on the road. Common colours for ambulance warning beacons are blue, red, amber, and white (clear). However the colours may vary by country and <b>sometimes</b> <b>by</b> operator.|$|E
5|$|DNA viruses : The genome {{replication}} of most DNA viruses {{takes place in}} the cell's nucleus. If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell <b>sometimes</b> <b>by</b> direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or – more usually – by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. However, viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} steel core used for ACSR is galvanized steel, but zinc-5% aluminium mischmetal alloy coated steel (<b>sometimes</b> called <b>by</b> the trade-names Bezinal or Galfan) and aluminium clad steel (<b>sometimes</b> called <b>by</b> the trade-name Alumoweld) are also available. Higher strength steel {{may also be}} used.|$|R
5|$|Dental {{sealants}} {{are another}} preventive therapy {{often used to}} provide a barrier to bacteria and decay {{on the surface of}} teeth. Sealants can last up to ten years and are primarily used on the biting surfaces of molars of children and young adults, especially those who may have difficulty brushing and flossing effectively. Sealants are applied in a dentist's office, <b>sometimes</b> <b>by</b> a dental hygienist, in an procedure similar in technique and cost to a fluoride application.|$|E
5|$|During peacetime and war, {{the command}} {{structure}} of the Northern Army remained the same. However, during times of great conflict and crisis, the raising of large militias required the appointment of many new officers with various titles, which were often bestowed as honorary titles to officials during times of peace. Large divisions were led by a General (Jiangjun 將軍) whose rank depended on status; divisions were divided {{into a number of}} regiments commanded by a Colonel, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>by</b> a Major. Regiments were divided into companies and led by Captains, who ranked Equivalent to 2,000-dan, while companies were further divided into platoons.|$|E
5|$|Every {{year since}} 2000 {{the town has}} held a food and wine festival during May. It {{includes}} an international food market with over 100 stalls selling food and drink, and a large marquee with a kitchen area erected in Saxon Square. Here cooking demonstrations are given, <b>sometimes</b> <b>by</b> a celebrity chef: past guests have included Gary Rhodes and Jean-Christophe Novelli. The week-long festival is a community event which aims to educate people in healthy eating {{as well as the}} availability of foods. During the festival local chefs are invited into schools to demonstrate recipes; and throughout the weekend the marquee hosts a cookery workshop for 7–10-year olds.|$|E

5|$|In Nuskhuri manuscripts, Asomtavruli {{are used}} for titles and {{illuminated}} capitals. The latter were used at the beginnings of paragraphs which started new sections of text. In {{the early stages of}} the development of Nuskhuri texts, Asomtavruli letters were not elaborate and were distinguished principally by size and <b>sometimes</b> <b>by</b> being written in cinnabar ink. Later, from the 10th century, the letters were illuminated. The style of Asomtavruli capitals can be used to identify the era of a text. For example, in the Georgian manuscripts of the Byzantine era, when the styles of the Byzantine Empire influenced Kingdom of Georgia, capitals were illuminated with images of birds and other animals.|$|E
5|$|In {{communal}} defence, prey groups actively {{defend themselves}} by grouping together, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>by</b> attacking or mobbing a predator, rather than allowing {{themselves to be}} passive victims of predation. Mobbing is the harassing of a predator by many prey animals. Mobbing is usually done to protect the young in social colonies. For example, red colobus monkeys exhibit mobbing when threatened by chimpanzees, a common predator. The male red colobus monkeys group together and place themselves between predators and the group's females and juveniles. The males jump together and actively bite the chimpanzees. Fieldfares are birds which may nest either solitarily or in colonies. Within colonies, fieldfares mob and defecate on approaching predators, shown experimentally to reduce predation levels.|$|E
5|$|Lack {{of money}} has precluded major improvements, however, and timber {{companies}} have replanted {{much of the}} logged area with non-native tree species. Coastline areas, including dunes and coastal prairie, have been invaded by exotic species, {{partly due to the}} suppression of forest fires until the 1980s. A fire management plan now allows controlled burning as one method to return the parkland to its original state. Since the redwoods were logged on the basis of accessibility, with inaccessible areas being cut last, large old-growth forest sections were isolated from one another, <b>sometimes</b> <b>by</b> many miles. In these cases it will be decades more before mature forest can return, regardless of the amount of money used to rehabilitate the ecosystem.|$|E

5|$|Many {{hundreds}} of medicines {{are derived from}} plants, both traditional medicines used in herbalism and chemical substances purified from plants or first identified in them, <b>sometimes</b> <b>by</b> ethnobotanical search, and then synthesised for use in modern medicine. Modern medicines derived from plants include aspirin, taxol, morphine, quinine, reserpine, colchicine, digitalis and vincristine. Plants used in herbalism include ginkgo, echinacea, feverfew, and Saint John's wort. The pharmacopoeia of Dioscorides, De Materia Medica, describing some 600 medicinal plants, was written between 50 and 70 AD and remained in use in Europe and the Middle East until around 1600 AD; it was the precursor of all modern pharmacopoeias.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{the year}} 2000 problem (Y2K) was the focus of {{significant}} COBOL programming effort, <b>sometimes</b> <b>by</b> the same programmers who had designed the systems decades before. The particular level of effort required to correct COBOL code has been attributed to the large amount of business-oriented COBOL, as business applications use dates heavily, and to fixed-length data fields. After the clean-up effort put into these programs for Y2K, a 2003 survey found that many remained in use.|$|E
5|$|The American robin's diet {{generally}} {{consists of}} around 40 percent small invertebrates (mainly insects), such as earthworms, beetle grubs, caterpillars and grasshoppers, and 60 percent wild and cultivated fruits and berries. Their ability {{to switch to}} berries allows them to winter much farther north than most other North American thrushes. They will flock to fermented Pyracantha berries, and after eating sufficient quantities will exhibit intoxicated behavior such as falling over while walking. Robins forage primarily {{on the ground for}} soft-bodied invertebrates, and find worms by sight (and <b>sometimes</b> <b>by</b> hearing), pouncing on them and then pulling them up. Nestlings are fed mainly on worms and other soft-bodied animal prey. In some areas, robins, particularly of the coastal race T. m. caurinus, will feed on beaches, taking insects and small mollusks.|$|E

5|$|The Golden Film {{awards are}} {{presented}} during small press ceremonies {{throughout the year}} and shortly after a film has reached the audience criterion. The trophies are presented by {{the director of the}} Netherlands Film Festival or <b>sometimes</b> <b>by</b> a member of the crew or cast of the film itself. Two trophies are presented for each film: one to the film crew, represented by the producer and the director, and the other to the cast of the film, represented by the lead actors.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} is omnivorous, {{eating a}} wide range of insects, earthworms, seeds and berries. It feeds mainly on the ground, running and hopping with a start-stop-start progress. It pulls earthworms from the soil, usually finding them by sight, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>by</b> hearing, and roots through leaf litter for other invertebrates. Small amphibians and lizards are occasionally hunted. This species will also perch in bushes to take berries and collect caterpillars and other active insects. Animal prey predominates, and is particularly important during the breeding season, with windfall apples and berries taken more in the autumn and winter. The nature of the fruit taken depends on what is locally available, and frequently includes exotics in gardens.|$|E
5|$|The second version, with blue-green filters {{over the}} projectors, was trialled {{on board the}} {{corvette}} HMCS Chambly in May 1941. This gave better results as the filters removed the reddish bias to the lamps when at low intensity (lower colour temperature). The supports too were retractable, so the delicate projectors could be stowed away for protection when not in use. This second version reduced Chambly's visibility by 50% in most conditions, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>by</b> as much as 75%. This was enough to justify development of a more robust version.|$|E
