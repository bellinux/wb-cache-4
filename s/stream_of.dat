A <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> titanium tetrachloride gas is added to a <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> molten sodium metal; the products (sodium chloride salt and titanium particles) is filtered from the extra sodium.

The reinforcements that were sent to the Muslims at Yarmouk arrived in small bands, giving the impression of a continuous <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> reinforcements, in order to demoralize the Byzantines and compel them to attack. The same tactic would be repeated again during the Battle of Qadisiyah.|$|E

5|$|But geology also {{provided}} an alternate route, albeit across foreign territory. The valleys of the Red and Minnesota Rivers {{lay in the}} beds of Glacial Lake Agassiz and its prehistoric outlet Glacial River Warren; the lands exposed when these bodies of water receded were flat plains between low uplands covered by prairie grasslands. At the Traverse Gap, only a mile (1.6 km) of land separated the Bois des Sioux River, a source <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> the Red (which flowed north to Hudson Bay) and the Little Minnesota River, a source <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> the Minnesota River (tributary to the Mississippi, which flowed south to the Gulf of Mexico). The valley floors and uplands of the watercourses along this gently graded route provided a natural thoroughfare to the south. The eyes of the colonists therefore turned to the new United States, both {{as a source of}} supplies and an (illegal) outlet for their furs.|$|E
