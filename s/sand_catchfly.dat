50|$|This site {{consists}} of road verges which have calcareous grassland with four nationally rare plants, and two locally uncommon ones, <b>sand</b> <b>catchfly</b> and yellow medick. There {{is also a}} strip of pine plantation which has several rare insects.|$|E
50|$|This {{grassland}} site on well-drained sandy soils {{has more}} rare plants {{than any other}} site in the county, including perennial knawel, Breckland thyme, wild grape hyacinth, <b>sand</b> <b>catchfly,</b> drooping brome and smooth rupturewort. There are also 22 nationally rare and 47 nationally scarce invertebrates.|$|E
50|$|Silene conica is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the pink family known by the common names striped corn catchfly and <b>sand</b> <b>catchfly.</b> It grows in dunes and sandy soils and is widespread in Europe and western Asia. It has an annual life history and produces self-compatible hermaphroditic flowers and occasional male-sterile flowers (i.e., gynomonoecy). Like other members of Silene section Conoimorpha, S. conica is readily recognizable based on its bright pink petals and the prominent, parallel veins on its calyx. In contrast to most flowering plants, S. conica {{appears to have a}} very rapid rate of mitochondrial mutation, and it is perhaps most notable for having the largest mitochondrial genome (11.3 Mb) ever identified.|$|E
50|$|Silene conoidea is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the pink family known by the common names weed silene and large <b>sand</b> <b>catchfly.</b> It is native to Eurasia, and it is known {{in other parts of}} the world, such as western North America, as a weed. It is an annual herb growing up to a meter in height with a hairy, partially glandular stem. The lance-shaped leaves are up to 12 centimeters long near the base of the plant and smaller farther up. The flower is enclosed in an inflated, hairy, glandular calyx of fused sepals which is ridged with many veins. It is open at the top, revealing five bright pink petals.|$|E
50|$|Vegetation such as Marram Grass is {{essential}} for dunes to work, dominating the stabilised parts of the dunes. Other grasses that grow there include Dune Fescue and Red Fescue. Dogs off leads can easily run around the dunes, and destroy the vegetation. Horses being ridden over the dunes will have a similar effect. The Climping dunes are an SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). In 2006 {{the total number of}} full species at Climping Gap stood at 256. It supports important populations of wintering birds and the numbers of wintering Sanderling, in particular, are of European significance. Vegetated shingle beaches are a nationally uncommon habitat. The beach at Climping is broad in the west but narrows to the east. Plant communities include Yellow horned poppy, Sea Kale, Sea Beet, Curled Dock, Eryngium maritimum, <b>Sand</b> <b>Catchfly,</b> Viperâ€™s Bugloss and Nottingham Catchfly.|$|E
