40|$|International audienceSince the {{establishment}} of the 1931 standard colorimetric observer, considerable knowledge on colour vision mechanisms has been acquired. Establishing colorimetry directly on Physiology is a new approach to colour specification. CIE technical committee 1 - 36 (TC 1 - 36) was established for proposing chromaticity diagrams based on the best set of colour-matching functions and cone fundamentals available to date. Cone fundamental is the name given to the relative spectral sensitivity of long-wave sensitive (L-), medium-wave sensitive (M-) and shortwave sensitive (Scones es. As explicated by Judd (1966), the cone fundamentals represent the <b>spectral</b> <b>absorptances</b> of the retinal photopigments included in cones multiplied by the spectral transmittances of the ocular media through which light passes to reach the retina. The CIE 2006 (Stockman and Sharpe, 2000; CIE, 2006) cone fundamentals are based on Stiles and Burch (1959) experimental colour matches and are validated by Physiology. A physiologically designed chromaticity diagram named the MacLeod-Boynton chromaticity diagram (MacLeod and Boynton, 1979) is proposed as well as a cone-fundamental-based (x F, y F) chromaticity diagram. All data are now fixed. Tables are available in the CIE publications (CIE, 2006; CIE in press). 1 Deriving the cone fundamentals The primary goal was to propose cone fundamentals that are securely grounded on colour-matching experiments with real observers and that would comply with Physiology. A comprehensive set of colour-matching data has been collected by Stiles and Burch (1959) from 49 colour normal observers. The colour matches were obtained at clearly photopic luminance levels, on 10 ° field, using spectral red, green and blue (RGB) primaries expressed in energy units. The Stiles-Burch colour matching data are recognised as the most secure experimental basis for founding cone fundamentals. Independently, a physiological approach has allowed Stockman and Sharpe (2000) to derive estimates of the cone spectral sensitivities for 2 ° viewing angle. Given the fact that dichromats lack one family of cone pigment, and that Scone responses can be cancelled by appropriate chromatic adaptation, these authors were able, using heterochromatic flicker photometry, to isolate and directly measure the Land M-cone spectral sensitivities. In parallel, the gene sequence associated with every L-cone photopigment was analysed in order to associate each spectral sensitivity with a known genotype. Such piece of information has enabled taking account of the incidence of two variants of the L-cones in the normal population. The Scone spectral sensitivities has been isolated in blue-cone monochromats and in chromatically adapted colour normal observers. Thus, at this stage, an intermediate step of calculation was introduced by Stockman and Sharpe (2000). In 1955, a small (interim) set of colour matches had been collected by Stiles (1955) on 2 ° field which could be compared with the well-characterized cone spectral sensitivities for 2 ° viewing angle. Provided the individual dichromatic data was adjusted in macular pigment and lens density, an appropriate linear fit between the data could be found, thus validating the spectral sensitivity for every cone family. To reinforce the colorimetric validity of the cone fundamentals, a linear transformation between the 10 ° cone spectral sensitivities and the 10 ° Stiles-Burch colour-matching functions had to be fixed...|$|R

40|$|Reactive dc {{magnetron}} sputtering onto glass-based substrates yielded deposits of thermochromic VO 2 with well-developed nanorods and nanowires.

Spectrophotometric measurements of total and diffuse transmittance and reflectance on VO 2 thin films, at room temperature and similar to 100 degrees C, allowed us to determine complex dielectric functions below and above the "critical" temperature for thermochromic switching (similar to 68 degrees C).

While {{recent studies have}} focused on leaf optical responses to acute plant stress, the effects of changes in plant resources on leaf optics remain poorly characterized. We examined leaf optical and anatomical responses of five temperate deciduous tree species to moderate changes in nutrient and light availability. Spectral reflectance in the visible waveband generally increased at high light, but decreased with increased nutrient availability. Patterns of both <b>spectral</b> reflectance and <b>absorptance</b> were primarily determined by chlorophyll concentration although carotenoid concentration was also influential. While most anatomical features did not explain residual variation in reflectance, cuticle thickness was significantly related to reflectance at complementary angles compared to the angle of incidence. Absorptance did not change with light environment; however, absorption efficiency per unit biomass increased by approximately 40 % under low light, due to reduced leaf mass per area. We conclude that changes in resource availability differentially influence leaf optical properties and that such changes are driven primarily by changes in pigment concentrations. The magnitude of leaf optical responses to moderate changes in resource availability was comparable to those of acute stress responses and varied among species...|$|R

40|$|Photovoltaics is a {{technology}} that directly converts photon energy into electrical energy. Depending on the photon source, photovoltaic systems can be categorized into two groups: solar photovoltaics (PV) and thermophotovoltaics (TPV). In solar photovoltaic systems, the photon source is the sun, whereas in thermophotovoltaic systems the photons are from artificially designed thermal emitters that operate at a lower temperature. The differences in the photon sources lead to different research emphases on the two photovoltaic systems in this work. This thesis investigates ways to control photon emission and absorption for solar energy and TPV applications. Several topics are discussed, including photon transport in multilayer structures, measurement of near-field thermal radiation, optical absorption in silicon nanowire structures, surface-plasmon enhanced near-bandgap optical absorption in silicon, and selective absorber surface for solar thermal applications. For thermophotovoltaic systems, the work is focused on thermal emission and photon transport. The study of photon transport in multilayer structures is presented. Results based on wave-optics and ray tracing methods are compared. The analysis shows that for structures contain {{a large number of}} layers, the coherence length of the emitting source is no longer a valid criterion to indicate whether ray tracing method is valid. Instead, wave inference effects always play a role. The effects of photon localization are also discussed. Surface-mode enhanced near-field thermal radiation is explored in this work as an effective way to tailor the thermal emission for TPV systems. Calculations based on fluctuation-dissipation theorem and Maxwell's equations are presented to study radiative heat transfer between two closely-spaced glass plates. The theoretical analysis shows that the radiative heat transfer between closely-spaced glass plates is enhanced by surface phonon polaritions and the flux can exceed the far-field upper-limit imposed by Planck's law of blackbody radiation. (cont.) An experimental system was built to test near-field radiative heat transfer between two parallel glass plates, and the experimental results show good agreement with the theoretical predictions. For solar photovoltaics, the emphasis in this work is on improving optical absorption in silicon-based cells. Two nanostructures, silicon nanowire arrays and silicon embedded with small silver particles, have been analyzed as potential candidates for solar energy harvesting. The study on silicon nanowire structures reveals that nanowires have desirable antireflection characteristics. Several parameters, such as the length and diameter of the nanowires as well as the spacing between the wires, have been studied to provide the basis for the optimization of nanowire based solar cells. The study shows that nanowire structures have low reflectance over a broad spectrum and can absorb shortwavelength photons efficiently. However, the analysis also indicates that silicon nanowire is not efficient in absorbing long-wavelength photons. Longer wires in comparison to the thickness of dense films are generally required to compensate low absorption of the near-bandgap photons. The analysis of surface-plasmon assisted photon absorption is presented {{to address the problem of}} inadequate absorption of near-bandgap photons in silicon. Instead of increasing the optical path of photons for more absorption, surface plasmons are explored to enhance the local electromagnetic field and thus the optical absorption. An extended Mie scattering formulation is used to calculate the optical absorption around spherical silver particles embedded in silicon. It is found that local field enhancement by surface plasmon can lead to 50 times more absorption near the bandgap of silicon. An analytical model is developed to study the concentration effects of the surface plasmon field. It is shown that the net absorption gain reaches maximum when the spherical shell surrounding the particle has an outer diameter of 1. 26 times of the particle diameter. The absorption loss in the metallic sphere, however, is a main obstacle to overcome. (cont.) Finally, a different approach of solar energy utilization is discussed in this work. Selective absorber surfaces are studied for solar thermal energy harvesting. The surfaces consist of subwavelength periodic metallic structures. Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD) analysis is conducted on the metallic structures. The effects of lattice spacing and structure thickness are presented. The numerical simulation indicates that the metallic structures have good <b>spectral</b> selectivity: high <b>absorptance</b> in visible range and low emittance in infrared. Fabrication of the selective absorber surface is attempted. Preliminary experimental results are given in this work. As a proof of concept, nickel is plated in porous anodic aluminum.

The first two models are simple but of limited accuracy and demonstrate that inverted luminance (of any form) cannot fully account for varying relative chroma around the hue cycle, particularly the minor minimum and maximum about 490 and 520 nm (which also feature in B:L functions). The third model is rather complex but very accurate, apparently the only accurate model of Munsell chroma or other experimentally based scales of relative chromaticness in the literature. It adjusts to any level of luminance or purity, as demonstrated for several levels. Three models of brightness (B:L ratio) for 2 ⁰ field aperture colors are given, based on either Munsell chroma or log inverted chromatic luminance. The former provides two accurate and simple models of the CIE B:L function: (1) log chroma = B:L ratio ± 0. 1, and (2) (chroma/k) x = B:L ratio ± 0. 1. The latter also predicts B:L for nonspectral colors and those of lower purities, e. g., object colors.

40|$|Estimating {{individual}} cone sensitivities on {{the basis}} of their corresponding individual color matching functions is a classic problem of color vision. To solve the problem one has, in effect, to postulate constraints on the shape of the cone sensitivities. For example, Logvinenko applied a linear matching method (originally proposed by Bongard and Smirnov [4]) which excludes all but one primary to which each of the sensitivities of the visual system is supposedly sensitive and, mathematically, if this constraint is met reasonable estimates should result. However, when applied to color matching functions in general, it turns out that the method estimates middle and especially long wave sensitivity quite poorly. We propose a new method based on linear optimization, in which it is assumed only that the photo-pigment <b>spectral</b> <b>absorptance</b> functions are known a priori. In an iterative scheme, the method works by simultaneously estimating the coefficients of the linear relation between the known individual color matching functions and estimated cone sensitivities and estimating the ocular and macular filtering that multiplied by the absorptances yield the estimated cone sensitivities. The ocular and macular pre-filtration is treated as a single spectral function (i. e. a combined ocular and macular filtration). We are also able to predict the cone sensitivities proposed by Stockman and Sharpe in recent research. The method is tested on a selection of individual 1959 10 degree Color Matching Functions, with the assumption that they have the Stockman and Sharpe 10 degree photo-pigment spectral absorbtance in common. The results for the estimated cone sensitivities look very plausible. Finally we have applied the method to the CIE 1964 10 degree observer and get very reasonable result as well...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} a novel {{building}} integrated photovoltaic/thermal (BIPVT) solar collector was developed, tested, modelled and optimised both experimentally and theoretically. Experimental testing found that glazing the prototype collector improved the maximum thermal efficiency by approximately 25 % and decreased heat loss, {{by a factor}} of two, relative to an unglazed collector. Additionally, the <b>spectral</b> <b>absorptance</b> of a photovoltaic (PV) cell and several coloured absorber samples were characterised. The experimental data was subsequently used in the development and validation of an optimisation model for BIPVT style collectors. Numerical optimisation showed that the collector thermal efficiency could be improved by maximising the geometric fin efficiency, reducing the thermal resistance between the PV cells and the absorber, and by increasing the transmittance-absorptance product of the PV cells and/or the absorber. The results showed that low cost materials, such as mild steel, could be used without significantly affecting the BIPVTs thermal efficiency. It was also shown that there was potential to develop coloured BIPVT collectors with acceptable thermal efficiencies. Finally, the model showed that potentially the air space in an attic could be used rather than traditional insulating materials. Subsequent computational and experimental fluid dynamics studies found that the heat transfer coefficients in a scale-model attic would result in R-values similar to mineral wool type insulation and therefore may provide sufficient insulation of a BIPVT in a cold roof building. In these studies the validity of an existing correlation for natural convection in an attic-shaped enclosure was extended to Grashof numbers in the range 10 ^ 7 to 10 ^ 9 from its previous range, 2. 9 x 10 ^ 6 to 9 x 10 ^ 6. The use of a single vertically mounted baffle was also found to reduce the natural convection heat transfer coefficients in attic-shaped enclosures.
