We present {{a model for the}} control of the inter-faces where the position of the central stream in this microfluidic channel is manipulated by regulating pressure at the two outer inlets. To allow the use of reservoirs of arbitrary size, we de-couple the pressure modulation mechanism from the reservoirs. The mechanism simultaneously modulates a variable fluidic re-sistance mechanically coupled to <b>squeeze</b> <b>pump</b> located in the fluid network between the reservoir and the channel. We show that the linearized dynamics of our nonlinear mechanism ex-plains the high bandwidth in our system. We use the linearized model to design a linear controller and demonstrate its effective-ness for the full nonlinear dynamics in simulation. We present experimental results short-term and long-term pressure regula-tion at the channel inlets for stable control of laminar flow in-terfaces. We envision that this approach will be useful for flow cytometry, chemical synthesis, drug delivery, and investigation of spatiotemporally integrated biological responses at molecu-lar, cellular, and tissue levels.

40|$|Objective: Penile {{prosthesis}} implantation is {{the solution}} of choice in patients who have failed or present contraindication {{to the use of}} all conservative treatment for erectile dysfunction (ED). Overall, satisfaction rates are high, with more than 80 % of patients and partners fully satisfied with cosmetic and functional result of surgery. Chronic postoperative pain, penile shortening, soft or hyposensitive glans, pencil like penis syndrome and difficulty to cycle the device represent the most common causes of patient’s dissatisfaction. Satisfaction rates are better assessed with the use of validated questionnaires such as the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) The aim of our study was to analyze the long-term mechanical reliability of the AMS 700 CX/CXM inflatable penile prosthesis and the patient’s satisfaction rate using IIEF and EDITS questionaire as standard reference. Materials and methods: A retrospective case notes review of all patients who have undergone implantation of a three pieces inflatable penile prosthesis AMS 700 CX and CXR between October 1997 and December 2010. Overall, 80 patients have undergone implantation of 3 pieces inflatable penile prosthesis AMS 700 CX InhibiZone. Patients have been administered the IIEF- 5 and EDITS questionnaires in combination with a non validated 9 domain questionnaire that assesses penile rigidity, sensation, orgasmic function, frequency of intercourse, impact of surgery on the quality of life, satisfaction rate. Results: Overall 10 years survival estimate according to the Kaplan Meier method of AMS 700 CX touch pump and AMS 700 CX momentary <b>squeeze</b> <b>pump</b> are respectively 77. 6 % and 82. 5 %. The median postoperative IIEF 5 and EDITS score were respectively 21. 46 and 73. 11, which show a high level of satisfaction. 59 patients (90. 8 %) were able to cycle the device and were engaging in penetrative sexual intercourse. Conclusions: Penile prosthesis implantation yields excellent results in terms of cosmetic and functional outcome and therefore has a significant impact on patients’ satisfaction, sex life and overall quality of life. Overall, long term reliability has been significantly improved and complication rates are low in the hands of experienced surgeons...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorus {{fertilizer}} {{distribution in the}} band is affected by band spacing, P application rate, and fertilizer P particle size. Twelve experiments were conducted over four years (1983 - 1986) to evaluate the effect of different factors influencing P {{fertilizer distribution}} in the band on grain yield and P uptake. From 1983 to 1985, five field experiments were conducted {{to determine the effect}} of P fertilizer particle size on grain yield and P uptake of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum, L.); in 1983, 1984 and 1986 four field experiments were conducted to determine the effect of band spacing of dual-placed N and P fertilizers on grain yield and P uptake of corn (Zea mays, L.); a 2 ̆ 2 Field Pot 2 ̆ 2 experiment was conducted in 1984 and 1985 to evaluate the effect of P fertilizer distance and distribution in the band on corn P uptake and dry matter production; and in 1986, effect of band spacing, P application rate, delivery tube size and traveling speed during application with a standard <b>squeeze</b> <b>pump</b> was evaluated on distribution of P fertilizer solution in the applied band. ^ The results indicate that phosphorus fertilizer particle size significantly affected grain yield and P uptake of winter wheat. Optimum particle size was about 0. 025 mg which is much smaller than P fertilizer particle sizes farmers normally use (about 20 mg). Great surface area of applied P fertilizer at particle sizes smaller than optimum, and also noncontinuous distribution of large particles in the applied band limited the efficiency of these particle sizes. Band spacing of dual-placed N and P fertilizers affected utilization of both nutrients. Effect of band spacing on N and P effectiveness were opposite in that applied P was more effective while N was less effective as the band spacing decreased. Distance that P fertilizer was applied from plants was important only at early stages of growth. Phosphorus uptake increased as spacing between injection points in the applied band increased. This was because as injection point spacing increased, the P target size (two dimensional surface of P affected soil exposed to the root system) increased, resulting in greater root-fertilizer contact. It was also found that P fertilizer solution is distributed as droplets in the band at low P application rates and narrow band spacings. Distance between droplets reduced probability of root-P fertilizer contact and decreased P fertilizer effectiveness. ^ While many factors influence P fertilizer efficiency, results indicate that P fertilizer distribution is a significant factor affecting efficiency in that it influences the probability of root-fertilizer contact. ...|$|E

We find, both through semiclassical calculations and through several detailed analytic methods, that <b>pump</b> <b>squeezing</b> is responsible for two competing processes: Reduced pump phase fluctuations improve limitations to squeezing; at the same time, increased pump intensity fluctuations can lead to a ‘‘spillover’’ of pump fluctuations onto negative pump phases and a consequent reduction in signal squeezing. ...|$|R

Using stochastic integration of the two-mode equations of motion in the positive-P representation, we find that larger violations of continuous-variable harmonic entanglement criteria are available for lesser effective interaction strengths than with a coherent pump. This enhancement of the quantum properties also applies to violations of the Reid-Drummond inequalities used to demonstrate a harmonic version of the Einstein-Podolsky- Rosen paradox. This could offer a real practical advantage over increasing the laser intensity, which will eventually damage the crystal, or using a larger crystal, in which case dispersion problems can be accentuated. We find that the conversion efficiency is largely unchanged except for very low pump intensities and high levels of squeezing...|$|R

40|$|The {{degenerate}} parametric oscillator above threshold is {{studied with}} phenomenological stochastic colored (nonwhite) pump noise for arbitrary pump to subharmonic relaxation rate. The current experimental limits of large intracavity threshold photon numbers (very small quantum noise) are considered, {{allowing for a}} semi-classical treatment of the system dynamics. A comparison between the effects of isotropic and <b>squeezed</b> <b>pump</b> noise on the internal transient and steady-state fluctuations is presented by simulation of the nonlinear semi-classical stochastic Langevin equations in the Wigner quadrature representation. It is found that the transient squeezing for the system starting in the unstable steady state (the vacuum) is not degraded by stochastic pump noise. A damped oscillatory behavior of the noise levels (periodic exchange of fluctuations between the squeezed quadrature of the signal and the pump) is observed for large damping of the signal in the turn on of pump depletion. Finally, it is shown that the limited squeezing above threshold in the steady state (50 %) due to pump depletion can be enhanced if squeezed stochastic noise with sufficient significant spectral components (broadband squeezing) is fed to the pump. The above-threshold steady-state squeezing has been calculated analytically from the linearized stochastic equations {{and the effects of}} the time scale associated to the relaxation of the pump noise (the noise correlation time) compared to the dissipative time scale of the system and the pump to subharmonic loss ratio are presented.

50|$|A {{myocardial}} bridge {{occurs when}} one of the coronary arteries tunnels through the myocardium rather than resting on top of it. Typically, the arteries rest on top of the heart muscle and feed blood down into smaller vessels that populate throughout the myocardium. But if the muscle grows around one of the larger arteries, then a myocardial bridge is formed. As the heart <b>squeezes</b> to <b>pump</b> blood, the muscle exerts pressure across the bridge and constricts the artery. This defect is present from birth. It can lead to uncomfortable, powerful heartbeats and angina. The incidence of the condition in the general population is estimated at 5% based on autopsy findings, but significance when found in association with other cardiac conditions is unknown.|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic, {{inflatable}} prosthesis {{also exist}} and were first described in 1973 by Brantley Scott et al. These saline-filled devices consist of inflatable cylinders {{placed in the}} erection chambers of the penis, a pump placed in the scrotum for patient-activated inflation/deflation, and a reservoir placed in the abdomen which stores the fluid. The device is inflated by <b>squeezing</b> the <b>pump</b> several times to transfer fluid from the reservoir to the chambers in the penis. After intercourse, a valve next to the pump is manually operated, allowing fluid {{to be released from}} the penis (not instantaneously; squeezing the penis may be necessary), causing the penis to return to a flaccid or semi-flaccid condition. Almost all implanted penile prosthesis devices perform satisfactorily for a decade or more before needing replacement. Some surgeons recommend these due to the opinion that they are more easily concealed and provide the highest levels of patient/partner satisfaction.|$|R

The popular elastomers for pump tubing are nitrile (NBR), Hypalon, Viton, silicone, PVC, EPDM, EPDM+polypropylene (as in Santoprene), polyurethane and natural rubber. Of these materials, natural rubber has the best fatigue resistance, and EPDM and Hypalon have the best chemical compatibility. Silicone is popular with water-based fluids, such as in bio-pharma industry, but have limited range of chemical compatibility in other industries.|$|R
40|$|Introduction.   A single-armed, prospective, multicenter study {{evaluated}} the redesigned American Medical Systems (AMS) 700 Momentary <b>Squeeze</b> (MS) <b>pump</b> inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) with enhanced features {{for ease of}} implantation and patient manipulation. The device incorporates design changes to all components: pump, cylinders, rear-tip extenders, and reservoir. Aim.   To assess physician and patient satisfaction with the new AMS 700 MS pump. Methods.   Patients were selected from the existing population experiencing erectile dysfunction (ED) without previous prosthetic implantation. Main Outcome Measures.   Survey questionnaires were used to capture physician feedback on ease of implantation and patient education. Patient satisfaction with the device and existence of autoinflation were assayed. Results.   Sixty-nine patients were implanted at seven U. S. sites. Mean age was 60. 1 [*]±[*] 9. 6 years. History of ED was > 5 years in 34 (44. 7 %) patients. Main ED etiology was organic, nonspecific (32 %). Eighty-four percent of the physicians felt proximal cylinder insertion was easier because of the smaller angle of cylinder input tubing and narrower base diameter. The new pump was felt easier to implant than the previous model by 57 % of the physicians. The patients found the manipulation of the pump simple at device activation, with 96 % easily locating the inflation bulb and 94 % deflating the device with one push of the deflation button. Reviews were mixed among physicians concerning ease of training compared with the Tactile pump. Patient training was easier in 71 %, harder in 21 %, and same in 8 %. Nevertheless, 67 % of the patients were trained in 6 minutes or less. At 6 months, 77 % of the patients were very satisfied, 9 % somewhat satisfied, and 14 % dissatisfied. Autoinflation occurred in two patients (3 %). Conclusion.   The new AMS 700 MS IPP seems a distinct improvement over previous devices with most physicians feeling implantation and patient instruction were easier. The device also satisfied 86 % of the users and virtually eliminated autoinflation. Knoll LD, Henry G, Culkin D, Ohl DA, Otheguy J, Shabsigh R, Wilson SK, and Delk J II.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{theories of}} multiwave mixing in two- and three-level media. The {{first part of}} the dissertation treats the semiclassical theories in two-level media. Chapter 2 gives the simple semiclassical theory of four-wave mixing when the two pump frequences differ by more than the reciprocal of the population-difference lifetime. This difference washes out the pump spatial holes as well as one of the two reflection gratings. We compare the results to the degenerate treatment of Abrams and Lind and find significant differences in the reflection coefficient spectra. Chapter 3 presents the semiclassical theory of multiwave in a squeezed vacuum characterized by unequal in-phase and in-quadrature dipole decay times. For a highly squeezed vacuum, we find sharp resonances in both probe absorption and reflection coefficients, which provide sensitive ways to measure the amount of squeezing in the vacuum. The second part of the dissertation treats the quantum theories in two- and three-level media. Chapter 4 develops the fourth-order quantum theory of multiwave mixing to describe the effects of sidemode saturation in two-level media. We derive explicit formulas for the fourth-order quantum coefficients and show that the fourth-order quantum theory reproduces the third-order semiclassical coefficient obtained by truncating a continued fraction. We apply the results to cavity problems and find significant differences in the sideband spectra given by the second- and fourth-order treatments, particularly as the sidemode approaches the laser threshold. The final chapter presents a quantum theory of multiwave mixing in three-level cascades with a two-photon pump. The explicit formulas for the resonance fluorescence spectrum and the quantum combination-tone source term are derived. The theory is applied to the generation of squeezed states of light. We find almost perfect squeezing for some strong pump intensities and good broad-band <b>squeezing</b> for low <b>pump</b> intensities...|$|R
40|$|Childhood sun {{exposure}} {{has been associated}} with increased risk of developing melanoma later in life. Sunscreen, children. s preferred method of sun protection, has been shown to reduce skin cancer risk. However, the effectiveness of sunscreen is largely dependent on user compliance, such as the thickness of application. To reach the sun protection factor (SPF) sunscreen must be applied at a thickness of 2 mg/cm 2. It has been demonstrated that adults tend to apply {{less than half of the}} recommended 2 mg/cm 2. This was the first study to measure the thickness at which children apply sunscreen. We recruited 87 primary school aged children (n= 87, median age 8. 7, 5 - 12 years) from seven state schools within one Brisbane education district (32 % consent rate). The children were supplied with sunscreen in three dispenser types (<b>pump,</b> <b>squeeze</b> and roll-on) and were asked to use these for one week each. We measured the weight of the sunscreen before and after use, and calculated the children. s body surface area (based on height and weight) and area to which sunscreen was applied (based on children. s self-reported body coverage of application). Combined these measurements resulted in an average thickness of sunscreen application, which was our main outcome measure. We asked parents to complete a self-administered questionnaire which captured information about potential explanatory variables. Children applied sunscreen at a median thickness of 0. 48 mg/cm 2, significantly less than the recommended 2 mg/cm 2 (p< 0. 001). When using the roll-on dispenser (median 0. 22 mg/cm 2), children applied significantly less sunscreen thickness, compared to the pump (median 0. 75 mg. cm 2, p< 0. 001), and squeeze (median 0. 57 mg/cm 2, p< 0. 001) dispensers. School grade (1 - 7) was significantly associated with thickness of application (p= 0. 032), with children in the youngest grades applying the most. Other variables that were significantly associated with the outcome variable included: number of siblings (p= 0. 001), household annual income (p< 0. 001), and the number of lifetime sunburns the child had experienced (p= 0. 007). This work is the first to measure children. s sunscreen application thickness and demonstrates that regardless of their age or the type of dispenser that they use, children do not apply enough sunscreen to reach the advertised SPF. It is envisaged that this study will assist in the formulation of recommendations for future research, practice and policy aimed at improving childhood sun protection to reduce skin cancer incidence in the future...|$|R
