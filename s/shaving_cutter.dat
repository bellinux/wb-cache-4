40|$|Abstract—Plunge shaving is {{the most}} {{advanced}} gear finishing technique which only needs radial infeed. Its advantages include increased productivity, accuracy, long tool life, and a simple machine structure. For the plunge shaving method, the gear tooth modification only depends on the surface geometry of the plunge <b>shaving</b> <b>cutter.</b> The analytical description of the gear with tooth modifications is firstly constructed by B-spline surface fitting. Then, the grinding wheel profile is parameterized and optimized for minimizing the surface deviations of theoretical and ground (from re-sharpening machine) tooth surfaces of the plunge <b>shaving</b> <b>cutter,</b> in which the topographic error has been reduced. The cutting trace of plunge <b>shaving</b> <b>cutter</b> has also been analyzed so that the shaving efficiency can be improved. Index Terms—Gear plunge shaving, Cone grinding wheel, Topographic error, <b>Shaving</b> <b>cutter</b> serration. et al. [9] proposed a method for shaving gears with double crowning by CNC shaving machine. For shaving methods other than plunge shaving, the gear tooth modification is accomplished by tooth modifications of the <b>shaving</b> <b>cutter</b> and the coordinated motions between cutter and gear. For the plunge shaving method, however, it only depends on the surface geometry of the plunge <b>shaving</b> <b>cutter.</b> Focusing on the surface geometry of <b>shaving</b> <b>cutter,</b> what’s really significant is precision of the region between SAP. (start of active profile) and EAP. (end of active profile) as shown in Fig. 1. In gear shaving, SAP. of cutter tooth shaves the gear tooth tip while EAP. shaves the gear tooth root. Traditionally, the cutter surface geometry results from a cutter re-sharpening machine by trial and error, which is very time-consuming. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{review of}} manufacturer's {{programs}} to make thread milling cutters {{has shown that}} most of milling cutters are produced with the helical flutes with the ω slope angle {{within the range of}} 10 ° [...] . 30 °. Thus, thread milling cutters, made of high speed steels, essentially, are not produced. In Russia there is GOST 1336 - 77, to regulate the parameters of thread milling <b>cutter</b> <b>shaving</b> with a straight flutes, made of high speed steels. It is established that available rake and clearance angles, and inclination angle of helical flutes at the accepted values of pitch and diameter of the tool lead to obtaining the angles of the tooth profile other than 30 degrees, thus requiring the calculation of angles β 1 and β 2 in each case of design. In the general case we have an asymmetrical profile with respect to the axis passing through the top of the tooth. Using the CATIA V 5 R 17 software, a geometric model that allows us to determine the angles of the tooth profile of thread milling cutter with helical flutes has been developed. The model research has been conducted for geometric and design parameters of thread milling cutter, made of cemented carbide and high speed steel. The paper presents a method for constructing models and key assumptions adopted for its development. Dependences are obtained for the model with a variation of the five factors (external diameter d, step profiles, P, rake γтц, clearance α, inclination angle of helical flutes ω) for thread milling cutters, made of cemented carbide and according to the model that extends the range of variation factors (d, P, γтц, ω) according to GOST 1336 - 77. Thus, this model to have the angles of the tooth profile of thread milling cutter with helical flutes can be used both to obtain the angles profile β 1 and β 2 {{in a wide range of}} varying tool parameters for all types of tool materials, and to broaden the possibilities for calculation of parameters according to GOST 1336 - 77. </p...|$|R
