40|$|A novel, high {{resolution}} Imaging <b>Slope</b> <b>Gauge</b> (ISG) at the Heidelberg Aeolotron is presented. The instrument allows {{measurements of the}} two-dimensional slope of short wind-driven water waves at unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. Wave number spectra are measured up to k = 13000 rad/m with a temporal resolution of more than 1500 Hz. The high sampling frequency eliminates aliasing up to wave numbers of about k = 2660 rad/m. A new non-linear calibration and data processing work flow has been implemented to convert raw camera images into wave slope {{in the range of}} ± 0. 96. The average statistical measurement error is estimated to be Δ s_rms = 0. 018, a significant improvement compared to previous Color Imaging <b>Slope</b> <b>Gauge</b> setups. Spectrally resolved measurements of the influence of various surface-active materials (surfactants) on small-scale waves are reported. The wave damping effects of different substances are analyzed. It is shown that, except for low wind speeds, gas transfer velocities across the air-sea boundary layer can be parametrized with the mean square slope of the waves, independent of the specific type of surfactant that is used...|$|R

The experiments were conducted the NASA Air-Sea Interaction Facility at Wallops Flight Facility (Wallops Island, VA). An imaging <b>slope</b> <b>gauge</b> was used to collect the alongwind component of the surface slope at sampling rates of up to 120 Hz for fetches of 5 m and 10 m and with wind speeds ranging from 5 to 12 m/s. In addition, mechanically generated gravity waves with frequencies of 0. 9 Hz were superimposed on the wind waves...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} optical {{instrument for}} {{the measurement of}} slope and height statistics of capillary and short gravity wind waves on the ocean has been built. This reflective stereo <b>slope</b> <b>gauge</b> (RSSG) {{is based on the}} work of Waas and Jahne (1992). It uses a dedicated stereo camera setup with a stereo infrared LED light source. Wave slope statistics can be derived from the observation of specular reflections and wave height from the parallax of the specular reflections in the stereo images. The instrument has been successfully tested in the Heidelberg Aeolotron...|$|R
40|$|New {{gradient-based}} surface reconstruction {{techniques are}} presented: regularized least absolute deviations based methods using common discrete differential operators, and spline based methods. All new methods are formulated {{in the same}} mathematical framework as convex optimization problems and can handle non-rectangular domains. For the spline based methods, either common P-splines or P 1 -splines can be used. Extensive reconstruction error analysis shows that the new P 1 -spline based method is superior to conventional methods {{in the case of}} gradient fields corrupted with outliers. In the analysis, both spline based methods provide the lowest reconstruction errors for reconstructions from incomplete gradient fields. Furthermore, the pre-processing of gradient fields is investigated. Median filter pre-processing offers a computationally efficient method that is robust to outliers. After the reconstruction error analysis, selected reconstruction methods are applied to imaging <b>slope</b> <b>gauge</b> data measured in the wind-wave facility Aeolotron in Heidelberg. Using newly developed segmentation methods, it is possible to detect different coordinate system orientations of gradient field data and reconstruction algorithms. In addition, the use of a zero slope correction for reconstructions from the provided imaging <b>slope</b> <b>gauge</b> data is justified. The impact of light refracting bubbles on reconstructions from this data is part of this thesis as well. Finally, some water surface reconstructions for measurement conditions with different fetch lengths at the same wind speed in the Aeolotron are shown...|$|R
40|$|With the Reflective Stereo <b>Slope</b> <b>Gauge</b> and the Medium Angle <b>Slope</b> <b>Gauge,</b> two new imaging {{instruments}} for {{the measurement of}} short wind waves on the ocean have been developed, validated, and deployed to a four week field experiment. Using active illumination with near-infrared LED light sources they are independent of natural light. Unlike other reflection-based techniques, they can be operated day and night under {{a wide range of}} environmental conditions. The instruments' performance was carefully validated in the laboratory and in the field. Their unique capabilities of simultaneously measuring the twodimensional slope probability distribution and the mean square slope (mss) of the waves, as well as wave height and a parameter linked to local surface curvature are demonstrated. Extensive measurements of short wave statistics from an air-sea interaction experiment off the coast of Peru are reported. A large variability of surface conditions due to the changing presence of surfactants on spatial scales smaller than one hundred meters was encountered. In a laboratory experiment, the dependence of gas transfer velocities on the suppression of waves by the soluble artificial surfactant Triton X- 100 was investigated. It is shown that mss describes gas transfer velocities better than wind speed or the friction velocity. The new instruments can provide robust routine ship-borne measurements of mss, a key component in the effort of replacing wind speed with mean square slope as the standard parameter for gas transfer velocities...|$|R
50|$|A {{clinometer}} or inclinometer is {{an instrument}} for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or depression of an object with respect to gravity. It {{is also known as}} a tilt meter, tilt indicator, <b>slope</b> alert, <b>slope</b> <b>gauge,</b> gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. Clinometers measure both inclines (positive slopes, as seen by an observer looking upwards) and declines (negative slopes, as seen by an observer looking downward) using three different units of measure: degrees, percent, and topo (see Grade (slope)#Nomenclature for details). Astrolabes are inclinometers that were used for navigation and locating astronomical objects from ancient times to the Renaissance.|$|R
40|$|A new optical {{instrument}} for {{the measurement of}} surface wave slope and height properties was recently developed at the University of Heidelberg. The abilities of this Reflective Stereo <b>Slope</b> <b>Gauge</b> (RSSG) to measure the two-dimensional surface topography will be demonstrated. The RSSG overcomes the usual inaccuracies of stereo triangulation at specular surfaces by using properly positioned artificial light sources. The stereo images of a water surface patch with a size of about 1 m 2 are filled with specular reflections that {{are very similar to}} sun glitter. An algorithm was developed that precisely determines the water surface elevation for all specular reflections and interpolates over image areas without visible reflections to yield two-dimensional surface topography. Results from both a test on a pier near Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the OSSPRE 2011 experiment on the Kilo Moana in the Pacific Ocean are presented to demonstrate the wide range of environmental conditions under which measurements are possible...|$|R
40|$|Optical wave <b>slope</b> <b>gauges</b> offer several {{advantages}} {{in comparison with}} conventional wire gauges: They do not disturb the water surface, can measure even high frequency capillaries without disturbance and damping, and the wave slope covers a much smaller range than does the wave height: all waves, independent of the frequency, roughly have the same maximum slope. We developed a refraction technique and tested its performance thoroughly. Slopes up to 1. 2 can be measured. The wave height influence on the slope signal is 0. 25 %/cm. For slopes less than 0. 5 the signal is linear to the slope with an overall accuracy of 3 %. Larger slopes are reduced by up to 5 - 15 % in amplitude. We demonstrate that correlation measurements even in the capillary region are possible with an oscillating laser beam position. We further developed a slope visualisation technique. This technique seems promising {{in view of the}} mass transport mechanisms through the aqueous viscous boundary layer...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} mean square slope has been {{calculated}} from slope images which were {{recorded by the}} Imaging <b>Slope</b> <b>Gauge</b> (ISG) at the annular wind-wave tank Aeolotron in Heidelberg. The calculations have been realized using three different methods, which are, (i) calculation of the variance, (ii) integration of the slope power spectrum and (iii) fitting the probability distribution function of slope with a model function. The resulting values have been compared {{to each other and}} to the existing live evaluation of the ISG for a wide range of wind and fetch conditions. Also the fetch dependence of mean square slope has been analyzed, which obtains information about the evolution of a wave field. Additionally the slope images have been separated with the use of band pass filters into slope images of gravity waves and capillary waves. By separating gravity from capillary waves it was possible to analyze their slope probability distribution functions individually...|$|R
40|$|The Reflective Stereo <b>Slope</b> <b>Gauge</b> (RSSG) was {{deployed}} to two cruises {{in the tropical}} Pacific Ocean in Dec. 2011 and Dec. 2012 to measure statistics of small-scale wind waves. During the cruises, both open ocean (Samoa – Hawaii, OSSPRE 2011 on R/V Kilo Moana) and coastal upwelling (off Peru, M 91 on German FS Meteor) areas were studied. Surface displacement (wave height time series with 50 Hz sampling rate) was measured by a stereo system with two light sources (Helmholtz stereopsis), while statistics of surface slope were obtained using a method related to Cox & Munk’s sun glitter technique. Furthermore, information {{on the scale of}} the smallest waves was gained from the brightness of specular reflections (which is related to surface curvature). This parameter is useful for determining the presence of surface slicks. The results underline the importance of monitoring parameters other than wind speed during gas exchange measurements. The presented methods allow for robust estimates of surface slope statistics under a wide range of conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} wind, rain, and surface slicks on the {{transport}} of heat and gas at the water surface was measured in experiments in the Hamburg linear wind wave flume {{in cooperation with the}} Institute of Oceanography at the University of Hamburg, Germany. Within this framework, imaging techniques for the measurement of wind wave topography and the measurement of surface temperature were combined. Both cameras were synchronized at high a frame rate of 312. 5 Hz to allow for a visual study of the mechanisms which are suspected to alter {{the transport of}} gas- and heat through the air-sea interface. Infrared imagery is capable to identify microscale breaking (e. g. Zappa et al. 2004) and Langmuir circulation on small scales (Melville et al. 1998). Also the effect of rain drops on the thermal boundary layer has been be studied with this technique for the first time. In contrast to previous studies, the image sequences are geometrically registered and the surface elevation is reconstructed. For the wave field both slope components were measured optically at a fetch of 14. 4 m using a color imaging <b>slope</b> <b>gauge</b> (CISG) with a footprint of 223 x 104 mm and a resolution of 0. 7 mm.

40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} measurements of short wind waves {{can be obtained}} by laser scanning <b>slope</b> <b>gauges</b> and surface <b>slope</b> imaging detectors in the recent development of optical techniques. Slope image data from wind wave experiments in wind wave facilities at Heidelberg and Marseille are used to study the propagation of short wind waves. The data were acquired by an interlaced CCD camera. Each pair of images is consisted of odd and even video fields that are 1 / 60 second apart. The propagation speed of short wavelets can thus be measured directly through tracking wavelets between a pair of the field images. The images are filtered into different spatial scales. The pairs of the spatial components are matched up for estimating the propagation speeds of waves at different wavelengths. The shortest waves are parasitic capillaries which are capable of matching the speed of long waves. They are quasi-stationary relative to the crest of the long wave within our measurement accuracy. This suggests that the group velocity of parasitic capillaries must be in near balance with the local orbital velocity of the underlying long wave. The waves of different lengths propagate, on the average, at different speeds proportional to the dispersion relation, and are not locked into the long wave phase speeds. There is a large variation in the propagating speeds due to the orbital advection by long waves...|$|R
40|$|An optical {{instrument}} for {{the measurement of}} surface ocean wave statistics has been developed and is presented in this thesis. Based on the reflective stereo <b>slope</b> <b>gauge</b> (RSSG) principle, it can simultaneously measure wave slope and height statistics. The instrument comprises a stereo camera setup and two light sources built from infrared LEDs (940 nm). Slope statistics are derived from the statistical distribution of the positions of specular reflections in images of the water surface. The parallax of the reflections in the stereo images gives {{the distance of the}} camera to the water surface which can be used to infer wave height statistics. A laboratory version of the instrument has been built, calibrated and tested in experiments at the Aeolotron wind wave facility. Two-dimensional slope probability distributions for slopes in the range of - 0. 05 < s_x,s_y < 0. 05 were obtained for a range of wind speeds and clean water as well as surface slick conditions. The mean square slope of the surface was derived and compared to data from simultaneous reference measurements. The two data sets are found to agree well for lower wind speeds, at higher wind speeds significant deviations occur. The causes for these deviations have been identified and taken into account in designing the {{instrument for}} field measurements. This ocean version of the instrument is ready to accompany heat exchange measurements aboard a research vessel in the Baltic Sea in June 2010...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the first high-speed system for slope imaging of wind-induced short water waves. The imaging <b>slope</b> <b>gauge</b> method is used, {{which is based}} on the shape from refraction principle. The downward looking camera with a telecentric lens observes the refraction of light rays coming from a high power custom telecentric LED light source that is placed underneath the wind wave facility. The light source can be programmed to arbitrary intensity gradients in the x- and y-direction, so that the origin of a light ray is coded in intensity. Four gradient images (acquired at 6000 fps) are combined for one 2 D slope image. By only using intensity ratios, the measurements become independent of lens effects from the curved water surface and inhomogeneities in the light source. Independence of wave height is guaranteed by using telecentric illumination and telecentric imaging. The system is capable to measure the slopes of a wind-driven water surface in the Heidelberg Aeolotron wind-wave facility on a footprint of 200 x 160 mm with a spatial resolution of 0. 22 mm and a temporal resolution of more than 1500 fps. For the first time, it is now possible to investigate the structure of short wind-induced waves with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to study their dynamic characteristics without aliasing effects. Example images and a video of a 3 D reconstructed water surface are shown to illustrate the principle...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of this project, the blocking of waves by inhomogeneous currents was studied. A laboratory experiment was conducted in collaboration with Steven R. Long at the linear wave tank of the NASA Air-Sea Interaction Facility, Wallops Island, VA during May 1999. Mechanically-generated waves were blocked approximately 3 m upstream from the wave paddle by an opposing current. A false bottom was used to obtain a spatially varying flow field in the measurement section of the wave tank. We used an imaging <b>slope</b> <b>gauge,</b> which was mounted directly underneath the sloping section of the false tank bottom to observe the wave field. For a given current speed, the amplitude {{and the frequency of}} the waves was adjusted so that the blocking occurred within the observed footprint. Image sequences of up to 600 images at up 100 Hz sampling rate were recorded for an area of approximately 25 cm x 25 cm. Unlike previous measurements with wave wire gauges, the captured image sequences show the generation of the capillary waves at the blocking point and give detailed insight into the spatial and temporal evolution of the blocking process. The image data were used to study the wave-current interaction for currents from 5 to 25 cm/s and waves with frequencies between 1 and 3 Hz. First the images were calibrated with regard to size and slope. Then standard Fourier techniques as well the empirical mode decomposition method developed by Dr. Norden Huang and Dr. Steven R. Long were employed to quantify the wave number downshift from the gravity to the capillary regime...|$|R
40|$|A large annular wind/wave {{facility}} with quasi unlimited fetch {{has been built}} at the Institute for Environmental Physics University of Heidelberg, Germany. The facility is designed to perform detailed studies of small-scale air-sea interaction. It is optimized for imaging short wind waves, accurate measurements of gas transfer velocities and to deploy infrared imaging techniques. The annular water channel has an outer diameter of 10 m and a width of 0. 65 m. It is 2. 4 m high and can be filled with water up to a height of 1. 2 m, which corresponds to a water volume of approximately 21 m 3. Wind is generated by a rotating paddle wheel up to 15 m/s. The air space is gas tight and the walls are insulated. Experiments can be performed with deionized water, artificial sea water, surfactants, and reactive gases. An air conditioning system controls independently humidity and air temperature. In conjunction with an air flushing system net heat fluxes at the water surface can be adjusted from - 500 to 1000 W/m 2. A water current with a speed up to 0. 5 m/s against the wind direction can be generated separately {{by a set of}} thrusters. Air temperature, water temperature, relative humidity, water current and wind speed are continuously monitored. Standard measurements techniques include a color imaging <b>slope</b> <b>gauge</b> (mean square wave slope and wave spectra), an infrared imaging system (heat transfer velocity), and infrared absorption spectroscopy (gas transfer velocities of He, H 2, N 20, and F 12).

40|$|Wind {{generated}} gravity-capillary waves {{have been}} measured along with wind parameters in a wind-wave tank, using a scanning laser <b>slope</b> <b>gauge</b> capable of good wavenumber and frequency resolution. The experiments address the generation and subsequent evolution of short wind-waves, their modulation by fluctuating wind forcing and {{their contribution to}} the momentum flux from the wind. Measured initial growth rates of waves in the along-wind direction are consistent with previous studies. The directionality of the growth rates is not proportional to any constant power of the cosine of the wind-wave angle. Typical features {{in the evolution of}} the wave field include the spreading of the wave energy along the dispersion relation Doppler shifted by the surface current, the emergence of the bound waves (harmonics of the dominant waves), reduction in the Doppler shift due to enhanced subsurface mixing, and downshifting of the dominant wavenumber and the consequent separation of the free and bound waves in frequency. The modulation of the wind speed over a 10 – 20 s period induces modulation with hysteresis on the wave spectral density. The relaxation rates required to explain these hysteresis loops are typically one order of magnitude smaller than the initial growth rates. Hysteresis loops are also seen in the wind stress under modulated wind speed, indicating that a significant fraction of the total stress is supported by waves. Total wind stress is estimated as the sum of the turbulent stress over a smooth surface and the momentum fluxes into all wave components. The momentum flux into each wavenumber is estimated from measured spectral density and a parameterized growth rate. The wave-supported stress is generally more than half of the total stress, and explicit estimation of this component improves the stress estimate significantly, especially when the water contains a variable concentration of surfactants. The best estimate of the wind stress is achieved if wave growth rates are artificially enhanced at wavenumbers higher than 200 rad/m. The hysteresis of estimated wind stress is significantly less than that measured directly. ...|$|R

These nique worked well but required tedious data processing. Their measurements {{were made in the}} vicinity of the Hawaiian islands from an airplane atimportant short waves are best measured by optical slope techniques because of their steep slopes and small heights. In this paper we describe a new scanning-laser glint sensor and measurements taken with it of sea-surface slope statistics in the Pacific Ocean. This instrument measures slope probability density functions ~PDF’s! from normalized histo-grams of specular laser reflections ~glints! in angle space. We use a Gram–Charlier series to compute PDF moments to the order of 4 and study the depen-dence of these moments on wind speed and stability of the air–sea interface ~which is proportional to the air–sea temperature difference!. Published optical measurements of sea-surface slope statistics are not plentiful, partly because of the about a 600 -m altitude during periods of neutral ~equal air and water temperatures! and positive ~air warmer than water! stability. Cox and Munk inves-tigated the wind-speed but not the stability depen-dence of their data. They found a strong linear correlation of the mean-square slope, a weak corre-lation of the skewness, and no statistically significant correlation of the PDF kurtosis ~peakedness relative to a Gaussian distribution! with wind speed. After the work of Cox and Munk, there was a two-decade gap in field measurements until interest in ocean slope statistics was renewed by the deployment of scatterometers for near-surface wind sensing. Since that time most optical field measurements have been made with refractive laser <b>slope</b> <b>gauges</b> that determine local slopes from the refraction of light as it passes from an immersed laser source through the water–air interface to a receiver above the water. 19 – 22 These instruments enjoy large signal-to-noise ratios, but they require optics immersed in sea water and can disturb the surface...|$|R

40|$|Spatio-temporal {{measurements}} of wind-driven short-gravity capillary waves are reported {{for a wide}} range of experimental conditions, including wind, rain and surface slicks. The experiments were conducted in a linear wind wave flume and for the water surface elevation eta(x,y,t) both components of the slope field s = grad eta were measured optically. For this the color imaging <b>slope</b> <b>gauge</b> (CISG) was realized, comprising a range of wavenumbers k = sqrt(kx^ 2 + ky^ 2) from 60 to 4500 rad/m. The instrument was improved to achieve a sampling rate of 312. 5 Hz, which now allows for the computation of 3 D wavenumber-frequency spectra S(kx, ky, omega). Using a new calibration method it was possible to correct for the intrinsic nonlinearities of the instrument in the slope range up to ± 1. In addition, the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) was measured and employed for the contrast restoration of the data. The results are generally consistent with former measurements. But, the shape of the saturation spectra in the vicinity of k > 1000 rad/m stands in contradiction to former investigations where a sharp spectral cutoff (propto k^(- 2) or k^(- 3)) is commonly reported. The new MTF corrected spectra show just a gentle decrease (between k^(- 0. 5) and k^(- 1)) for k > 1000 rad/m, which has implications for the modeling of the energy fluxes in the wave field. Concerning the dispersion relation, a first approach for a quantitative evaluation of the wavenumber-frequency spectrum is shown. This includes estimates of the surface tension and the Doppler shift due to the surface shear flow and the wave-wave modulations. The wave measurements were accompanied by synchronized and spatially coinciding {{measurements of}} the surface temperature by means of infrared imagery. The temperature data is mapped onto an animated graphical model of the reconstructed surface elevation using a new interactive visualization tool.

40|$|This report {{proposes a}} method of {{measuring}} the two-dimensional Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) of an optical system. The MTF quantifies the degree of optical damping exhibited by this system, where optical damping refers {{to the loss of}} contrast for small structures (at higher spatial frequencies) in the image. A lens and a digital camera in telecentric arrangement are used to take an image of a target in the object plane. This target consists of a sequence of alternating large and small circles. A digital target reconstruction has been developed to determine the appearance of the image in the absence of optical damping. Transforming these two images into Fourier space and dividing one by the other calculates the MTF. An advantage of this method is that the MTF measurement is automatic and uses modern digital image processing algorithms. The round edge of the circle ensures that the Fourier space images carry information in all spatial directions. Each adjacent circle pair may be used to calculate the regional MTF at that point in the image. The MTF is evaluated at various regions of the image so that the influence of lens aberrations can be determined. This method of MTF measurement may be applied to the Imaging <b>Slope</b> and Height <b>Gauge</b> wave visualisation system in order to correct defocusing errors...|$|R
