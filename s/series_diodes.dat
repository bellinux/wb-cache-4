When a hot-swap component is inserted its input and output signal pins will represent a temporary short-circuit to ground.

One common design solution is to protect bussed signal pins with <b>series</b> <b>diodes</b> or resistors.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the effect of the commutation (overlap) period on the value of the output current and on the stability of a Current Source Inverter (CSI). The Current Source Inverter employs Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) as switches. A mathematical formula is developed to account for the overlap period and to explore the effects of various parameters on the deviation of the output current from the demand current. Also, this paper shows that the CSI during commutation is subject to oscillations due to diode reverse recovery and due to low output impedance of the “Master” switch. The effect of the commutation loop elements and the stray inductances are explored. The oscillations are shown in both simulation and experimental results. These oscillations necessitate the need for small RC snubbers, whose effect is also explored in analysis and experimentation. It will be shown that the snubbers not only dampen oscillations but they also achieve voltage sharing between series IGBTs or <b>series</b> <b>diodes</b> in the “Slave” or “Off” switches.

40|$|A {{semiconductor}} {{solid state}} switch has been constructed and tested in the prototype extraction kicker pulse generator of CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1]. The switch is made of 10 modified 4. 5 kV, 66 mm symmetric GTO's (also called FHCT-Fast High Current Thyristor), connected in series. It holds off a d. c. voltage of 30 kV and conducts a 5 µs half-sine wave current of 20 kA with an initial di/dt of 10 kA/µs. Major advantages of the switch are the extremely low self-firing hazard, no power consumption during the ready-to-go status, instantaneous availability, simple condition control, very low noise emission during soft turn-on switching and easy maintenance. However, the inherent soft, relatively slow turn-on time is a non negligible part of the required rise time and this involves adaptation of generator components. A dynamic current range of 16 is achieved with variations in rise time, which stay within acceptable limits. Important generator improvements have been made with the <b>series</b> <b>diodes</b> and freewheel diodes. A more efficient droop compensation circuit is being studied. It is directly connected in series with the freewheel diode stack and maintains an acceptable flattop variation of 5 % of the magnet current during 90 µs.

The {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{development}} of nanosatellites power management systems, methods of formation of sequence diagrams, selection of methods for solving formed mathematical equations to maximize nanosatellite energy or its remaining working time. Since almost every nanosatellite has the tasks for which more time than necessary is given, it is possible to optimize the sequence diagram taking into account real tasks execution time. For example, coincidence of the maxima of illumination and maximum energy consumption allows to transfer a larger amount of the energy directly from the solar battery to the load, bypassing the buffer - battery pack, thereby increasing its lifetime and reducing energy losses. To ensure minimizing of energy loss, needs the algorithms of the sequence diagram calculation, able to simultaneously take into account energy consumption at all its segments, shifting execution of not linked to a single point tasks to energetically more favorable intervals. 20 To be calculated, the sequence diagram is divided into intervals on which modes of satellite systems and subsystems remain unchanged. At each of these intervals for all the participants of energy provided coefficients, showing the degree of activity. In the case of using the method of Lagrange multipliers these coefficients may coincide with the Lagrange coefficients, simplifying the calculations. Also, the method of successive approximations for the correction of sequence diagrams was proposed, which allows to clarify the sequence diagram with a much smaller amount of computation and memory use than the method of Lagrange multipliers. The paper shows an example how to form the maximize expression and limitations, select the interval length and group the loads for satellite. Also shown the full way of calculating the sequence diagram: creation simplified timeline with Lagrange multipliers method, transition to ?normal? sequence diagram and clarifying it with the method of successive approximations. Proposed methods can also be used for to optimize sequence diagrams with the criteria of maximizing nanosatellite energy and its working time. In case of most nanosatellites, optimization will use not much more calculating resources than maximization, and can be performed at once, using the same datum that maximization does. Proposed methods and their combination can be used while performing the following tasks: correcting sequence diagram at the flight using nanosatellite MCU, correcting sequence diagram with the flight datum using PC?s on Earth and further data transmission onboard, creating sequence diagram on nanosatellite, creating sequence diagram on Earth, selecting the best combination of nanosatellite components, systems and their settings. In this paper the author proposed a method of constructing the power supply system of the satellite POLYTAN- 1 NTU "KPI" {{on the basis of the}} developed energy maximize algorithms. In addition to the proposed methods, its feature is the way of solar cells and power converter connecting. It allows not to use <b>series</b> <b>diodes</b> with solar panels, reduce the range of power variation in power converters, and provides each panel working in the maximum power point, which increases the efficiency and fault tolerance of satellite. The paper also describes the developed software, which implemented the proposed methods of the sequence diagrams constructing. It also can be used for energy simulation of the satellites work in different modes, and have the possibility to real-time visualize the timelines. It was used to analyze six sequence diagrams, from which two were formed with typical way for nanosatellites. Using the developed software, the control sequence diagram of satellite POLYTAN- 1 was calculated. It allows to extend the operation of the satellite in normal mode at 3. 2 months or 29 %. At the present day this satellite is working on orbit during 22 month. Also the results will be used for two-unit satellite POLYTAN- 2 -SAU which is developing for international project QB 50 devoted to upper atmosphere research.
