Instead, Zahir took Acre by force in July 1746.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the size}} of the fines against him, Bilzerian first filed for {{bankruptcy}} in 1991.

Later in the month, a federal judge ordered Bilzerian imprisoned for contempt of court due to his failure to disclose his assets.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{personal}} jurisdiction in English law has its {{origin in the}} idea that a monarch could not exercise power over persons or property located outside of his or her kingdom. [...] To some degree, this was a de facto rule; the monarch's men could not arrest people or seize property outside the kingdom without risking physical conflict with the soldiers and police of other kingdoms. Slowly this principle was incorporated into written law, but problems arose in cases where property owners could not be sued because they had left the kingdom or had died and therefore were not present within the kingdom at the time they were being sued. To solve this problem, the courts created another type of jurisdiction, called quasi in rem, that is, jurisdiction over the land itself, even if the person who owned the land was not in the country. However, this jurisdiction was limited to the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> <b>debts</b> owed by the owner of the land.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{functions}} associated with the older Dutch-language terms translated as bailiff in English, are no longer found in one officer. The modern terms huissier de justice (in French) or gerechtsdeurwaarder (in Dutch) however, are often, and inaccurately, translated into English as bailiff, though the latter under an Anglo Saxon law system {{is by no means}} identical to the former who is typical for many countries influenced by the Napoleonic Code. He or she is a sworn officer who may legally deliver exploits (process serving), see to the execution of court orders such as the confiscation of goods, or make formal record of events, acts and circumstances. In Belgium, the bailiff can be appointed by a confiscating court to exercise the judicial mandate of schuldbemiddelaar (in Dutch) or médiateur de dettes (in French), a debt negotiator, in a procedure called collectieve schuldenregeling (CSR) or médiation collective de dettes, a collectively negotiated <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> <b>debts,</b> which is comparable with the regulations by the Wet Schuldsanering Natuurlijke Personen (WSNP) in the Netherlands.|$|E

[...] Second, the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> Zarin's gambling <b>debts</b> constituted a [...] "contested liability." ...|$|R
