5|$|Green {{chrome oxide}} {{was a new}} <b>synthetic</b> green created by a chemist named Pannetier in Paris in about 1835. Emerald green was a <b>synthetic</b> deep green made in the 19th century by hydrating chrome oxide. It was also known as Guignet green.|$|E
5|$|The logical {{positivism}} movement {{originated in the}} Vienna Circle and was continued by British philosopher A. J. Ayer. The Vienna Circle adopted the distinction between analytic and <b>synthetic</b> statements: analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves, such as definitions, tautologies or mathematical statements, while <b>synthetic</b> statements make claims about reality. To determine whether a <b>synthetic</b> statement is meaningful, the Vienna Circle developed a verifiability theory of meaning, which proposed that for a <b>synthetic</b> statement to have cognitive meaning, its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable. Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified, the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless.|$|E
5|$|A 1998 {{study using}} rats {{found that the}} biopersistence of <b>synthetic</b> fibers after one year was 0.04–10%, but 27% for amosite asbestos. Fibers that persisted longer {{were found to be}} more carcinogenic.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{clean-up}} it {{was proposed}} to line the two disused graving docks with an impervious <b>synthetic</b> membrane and fill them with the contaminated soil.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin S. Garvey – noted chemist at BF Goodrich {{who worked}} on the {{development}} of <b>synthetic</b> rubber, contributed to understanding of vulcanization, and developed early techniques for small scale evaluation of rubbers.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is a <b>synthetic</b> {{chemical}} element with symbol Bh and atomic number 107. It {{is named after}} Danish physicist Niels Bohr. It is a <b>synthetic</b> element (an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature) and radioactive; the most stable known isotope, 270Bh, has a half-life of approximately 61seconds, though the unconfirmed 278Bh may have a longer half-life of about 690seconds.|$|E
5|$|Both CVD and HPHT {{diamonds}} can be {{cut into}} gems and various colors can be produced: clear white, yellow, brown, blue, green and orange. The appearance of <b>synthetic</b> gems on the market created major concerns in the diamond trading business, {{as a result of}} which special spectroscopic devices and techniques have been developed to distinguish <b>synthetic</b> and natural diamonds.|$|E
5|$|Crambe oil, {{extracted}} from {{the seeds of the}} Crambe abyssinica. High in erucic acid, used as an industrial lubricant, a corrosion inhibitor, and as an ingredient in the manufacture of <b>synthetic</b> rubber.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is a <b>synthetic</b> {{chemical}} element with symbol Ds and atomic number 110. It {{is an extremely}} radioactive <b>synthetic</b> element. The most stable known isotope, darmstadtium-281, has a half-life of approximately 10seconds. Darmstadtium was first created in 1994 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research {{near the city of}} Darmstadt, Germany, after which it was named.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium is a <b>synthetic</b> element with symbol Es and {{atomic number}} 99. It is the seventh {{transuranic}} element, and an actinide.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} history, {{agriculture}} {{has been}} organic, without <b>synthetic</b> fertilisers or pesticides, and without GMOs. With the advent of chemical agriculture, Rudolf Steiner called for farming without <b>synthetic</b> pesticides, and his Agriculture Course of 1924 {{laid the foundation for}} biodynamic agriculture. Lord Northbourne developed these ideas and presented his manifesto of organic farming in 1940. This became a worldwide movement, and organic farming is now practiced in most countries.|$|E
5|$|Francium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{unstable}} of the naturally occurring elements: its longest-lived isotope, francium-223, has a half-life of only 22minutes. The only comparable element is astatine, whose most stable natural isotope, astatine-219 (the alpha daughter of francium-223), has a half-life of 56seconds, although <b>synthetic</b> astatine-210 is much longer-lived with a half-life of 8.1hours. All isotopes of francium decay into astatine, radium, or radon. Francium-223 also has a shorter half-life than the longest-lived isotope of each <b>synthetic</b> element up to and including element 105, dubnium.|$|E
5|$|Gem-quality {{diamonds}} {{grown in}} a lab can be chemically, physically and optically identical to naturally occurring ones. The mined diamond industry has undertaken legal, marketing and distribution countermeasures to protect its market from the emerging presence of <b>synthetic</b> diamonds. <b>Synthetic</b> diamonds can be distinguished by spectroscopy in the infrared, ultraviolet, or X-ray wavelengths. The DiamondView tester from De Beers uses UV fluorescence to detect trace impurities of nitrogen, nickel or other metals in HPHT or CVD diamonds.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is {{not thought}} to be an {{essential}} element for any living organism. Some complex organic germanium compounds are being investigated as possible pharmaceuticals, though none have yet proven successful. Similar to silicon and aluminum, natural germanium compounds tend to be insoluble in water and thus have little oral toxicity. However, <b>synthetic</b> soluble germanium salts are nephrotoxic, and <b>synthetic</b> chemically reactive germanium compounds with halogens and hydrogen are irritants and toxins.|$|E
5|$|Hassium is a <b>synthetic</b> {{chemical}} element with symbol Hs and atomic number 108. It {{is named after}} the German state of Hesse. It is a <b>synthetic</b> element and radioactive; the most stable known isotope, 277Hs, has a half-life of approximately 30seconds. More than 100atoms of hassium have been synthesized to date.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Eckard Wimmer's {{group at}} SUNY Stony Brook succeeded in synthesizing {{poliovirus}} from its chemical code, producing the world's first <b>synthetic</b> virus. Scientists first converted poliovirus's published RNA sequence, 7741 bases long, into a DNA sequence, as DNA {{was easier to}} synthesize. Short fragments of this DNA sequence were obtained by mail-order, and assembled. The complete viral genome was then assembled by a gene synthesis company. This whole painstaking process took two years. Nineteen markers were incorporated into the synthesized DNA, {{so that it could}} be distinguished from natural poliovirus. Enzymes were used to convert the DNA back into RNA, its natural state. Other enzymes were then used to translate the RNA into a polypeptide, producing functional viral particle. The newly minted <b>synthetic</b> virus was injected into PVR transgenic mice, to determine if the <b>synthetic</b> version was able to cause disease. The <b>synthetic</b> virus was able to replicate, infect, and cause paralysis or death in mice. However, the <b>synthetic</b> version was between 1/1,000th and 1/10,000th as lethal as the original virus.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 White {{predicted}} that improved agricultural practices, selection of high-yielding hybrids, microbial production, {{and the development}} of <b>synthetic</b> peroxides would lower prices.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 a <b>synthetic</b> peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO) {{was found}} to inhibit the {{expression}} of New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase, an enzyme that many drug-resistant bacteria use to destroy carbapenems.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 {{the first}} stable semisynthetic {{organism}} was created. It was a (single cell) bacterium with two <b>synthetic</b> bases (called X and Y). The bases survived cell division.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a rise in cases of {{undisclosed}} <b>synthetic</b> diamond melee being found in set jewelry and within diamond parcels sold in the trade. Due to the relatively inexpensive cost of diamond melee, as well as relative lack of universal knowledge for identifying large quantities of melee efficiently, not all dealers have made an effort to test diamond melee to correctly identify whether it is of natural or man-made origin. However, international laboratories are now beginning to tackle the issue head-on, with significant improvements in <b>synthetic</b> melee identification being made.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{diamonds}} {{are valued}} mostly for their hardness and heat conductivity, with the gemological qualities of clarity and color being mostly irrelevant. About 80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 100 million carats or 20tonnes annually) are unsuitable {{for use as}} gemstones are relegated for industrial use (known as bort). <b>synthetic</b> diamonds, invented in the 1950s, found almost immediate industrial applications; 3billion carats (600tonnes) of <b>synthetic</b> diamond is produced annually.|$|E
5|$|Interferometric <b>synthetic</b> {{aperture}} radar (InSAR) is a radar {{technique used}} in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite <b>synthetic</b> aperture radar {{images of a}} geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes {{that have taken place}} between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band <b>Synthetic</b> Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E
5|$|Like all <b>synthetic</b> {{transuranic}} elements, isotopes of einsteinium {{are very}} radioactive and are considered highly dangerous to health on ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Makinti's works, {{including}} her Clemenger Award and NATSIAA paintings, are created with <b>synthetic</b> polymer on linen or canvas.|$|E
5|$|Many viruses can be {{synthesised}} de novo ("from scratch") and {{the first}} <b>synthetic</b> virus was created in 2002. Although somewhat of a misconception, {{it is not the}} actual virus that is synthesised, but rather its DNA genome (in case of a DNA virus), or a cDNA copy of its genome (in case of RNA viruses). For many virus families the naked <b>synthetic</b> DNA or RNA (once enzymatically converted back from the <b>synthetic</b> cDNA) is infectious when introduced into a cell. That is, they contain all the necessary information to produce new viruses. This technology is now being used to investigate novel vaccine strategies. The ability to synthesise viruses has far-reaching consequences, since viruses can no longer be regarded as extinct, as long as the information of their genome sequence is known and permissive cells are available. , the full-length genome sequences of 3843 different viruses, including smallpox, are publicly available in an online database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.|$|E
5|$|Meitnerium is a <b>synthetic</b> {{chemical}} element with symbol Mt and atomic number 109. It {{is an extremely}} radioactive <b>synthetic</b> element (an element not found in nature that can be created in a laboratory). The most stable known isotope, meitnerium-278, has a half-life of 7.6seconds, although the unconfirmed meitnerium-282 may have a longer half-life of 67seconds. The GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany, first created this element in 1982. It is named for Lise Meitner.|$|E
5|$|Mercury {{occurs in}} {{deposits}} {{throughout the world}} mostly as cinnabar (mercuric sulfide). The red pigment vermilion is obtained by grinding natural cinnabar or <b>synthetic</b> mercuric sulfide.|$|E
5|$|Most {{industrial}} applications of <b>synthetic</b> diamond {{have long been}} associated with their hardness; this property makes diamond the ideal material for machine tools and cutting tools. As the hardest known naturally occurring material, diamond {{can be used to}} polish, cut, or wear away any material, including other diamonds. Common {{industrial applications}} of this ability include diamond-tipped drill bits and saws, and the use of diamond powder as an abrasive. These are by far the largest industrial applications of <b>synthetic</b> diamond. While natural diamond is also used for these purposes, <b>synthetic</b> HPHT diamond is more popular, mostly because of better reproducibility of its mechanical properties. Diamond is not suitable for machining ferrous alloys at high speeds, as carbon is soluble in iron at the high temperatures created by high-speed machining, leading to greatly increased wear on diamond tools compared to alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Most {{materials}} with high thermal conductivity are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure <b>synthetic</b> diamond has high thermal conductivity, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} a heat sink for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, <b>synthetic</b> diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.|$|E
5|$|Natural rubies are {{corundum}} (aluminum oxide) crystals {{that are}} colored red (the rarest type) due to chromium (III) ions (other colors of corundum gems are termed sapphires). A red-colored artificial ruby {{may also be}} achieved by doping chromium(III) into artificial corundum crystals, thus making chromium a requirement for making <b>synthetic</b> rubies. Such a <b>synthetic</b> ruby crystal {{was the basis for}} the first laser, produced in 1960, which relied on stimulated emission of light from the chromium atoms in such a crystal.|$|E
5|$|Roentgenium is a <b>synthetic</b> {{chemical}} element with symbol Rg and atomic number 111. It is a <b>synthetic</b> element {{that can be}} created in a laboratory but is not found in nature. The most stable known isotope, roentgenium-282, has a half-life of 2.1minutes, although the unconfirmed roentgenium-286 may have a longer half-life of about 11minutes. Roentgenium was first created in 1994 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany. It is named after the physicist Wilhelm Röntgen (also spelled Roentgen).|$|E
5|$|Rutherfordium is a <b>synthetic</b> {{chemical}} element with symbol Rf and atomic number 104, named after physicist Ernest Rutherford. As a <b>synthetic</b> element, {{it is not}} found in nature and can only be created in a laboratory. It is radioactive; the most stable known isotope, 267Rf, has a half-life of approximately 1.3hours.|$|E
5|$|Screening devices {{based on}} diamond type {{detection}} {{can be used}} to make a distinction between diamonds that are certainly natural and diamonds that are potentially <b>synthetic.</b> Those potentially <b>synthetic</b> diamonds require more investigation in a specialized lab. Examples of commercial screening devices are D-Screen (WTOCD / HRD Antwerp) and Alpha Diamond Analyzer (Bruker / HRD Antwerp).|$|E
5|$|Seaborgium is a <b>synthetic</b> {{chemical}} element with symbol Sg and atomic number 106. It {{is named after}} the American nuclear chemist Glenn T. Seaborg. It is a <b>synthetic</b> element (an element that can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature) and radioactive; the most stable known isotope, 269Sg, has a half-life of approximately 3.1minutes.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods for}} {{identifying}} <b>synthetic</b> diamonds can be performed, {{depending on the}} method of production {{and the color of}} the diamond. CVD diamonds can usually be identified by an orange fluorescence. D-J colored diamonds can be screened through the Swiss Gemmological Institute's Diamond Spotter. Stones in the D-Z color range can be examined through the DiamondSure UV/visible spectrometer, a tool developed by De Beers. Similarly, natural diamonds usually have minor imperfections and flaws, such as inclusions of foreign material, that are not seen in <b>synthetic</b> diamonds.|$|E
5|$|Since 1900, {{agriculture}} in the developed nations, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labour has been replaced by mechanization, and assisted by <b>synthetic</b> fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding. The Haber-Bosch process allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields. Modern agriculture has raised social, political, and environmental issues including water pollution, biofuels, genetically modified organisms, tariffs and farm subsidies. In response, organic farming developed in the twentieth century as an alternative to the use of <b>synthetic</b> pesticides.|$|E
