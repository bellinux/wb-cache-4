More over the public key management scheme serves as an underlying mechanism for both key distribution and establishing security relationships between nodes...|$|R

This mechanism is designed to authenticate inter-domain SIP requests based on domain certificates to prevent identity theft. Nevertheless, despite its contribution, this protection raises some "side effects", that actually lead to new vulnerabilities in both the availability and confidentiality of SIP services. We {{provide an overview of}} different attack possibilities and explain them in more detail, including attacks utilizing algorithm complexity, <b>certificates</b> <b>storage,</b> and <b>certificates</b> distribution. We also suggest some alternative design to prevent or reduce the attacks. SIP, VoIP, NGN, Authentication, Denial of Service, Timing attack...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Smartcards and PKCS # 11 are an {{appealing}} solution for combined <b>storage</b> and <b>certificate</b> {{management at the}} enduser level. Many applications use PKCS # 11 primitives for security reasons: a popular browser, like Netscape Navigator contain a PKCS # 11 cryptographic module that plays {{a critical role in}} secure web surfing and e-mail signing and encryption. Nevertheless, most market-ready solutions ([SMARTSIGN], [GPKPKCS# 11], [SLBCBPKCS# 11]) use non-programmable cards or else do not exploit the card’s programmable capabilities. Instead they utilize cryptographic functions built into the card. This results in applications having the card manufacturer’s semantics instead of PKCS # 11 semantics. In this article we present our work: Java Card Certificate Management (JCCM). JCCM moves PKCS # 11 middleware into the card itself. This results in greater flexibility and less implementation dependence for applications. We have developed JCCM for two cards: the GemXpresso RAD 211 is and the Cyberflex for Linux Starter’s Kit 2. 1. We have also developed the corresponding dynamic library for Netscape enabling our endusers to use JCCM in their daily. ...|$|R

The sophistication of the malicious techniques used by attackers is amazingly advanced. Defensive measures for protecting a device must be even more sophisticated and robust. This paper presents an architecture that manages cryptographic keys for a secure memory interface on an FPGA. The architecture includes functional units that serve to authenticate a user, create a key with multiple layers of security, and encrypt an external memory interface using that key. Cryptographic methods built into the system include an RSA-related secure key exchange, the Secure Hash Algorithm, a <b>certificate</b> <b>storage</b> system, and the Data Encryption Standard algorithm in counter mode. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{principles}} {{in the study}} of the triad: the language – custom – community Studies of the triad language – custom – community is a synthesis of two parallel research traditions: research centre of Łódź, which is known from studies of the custom – language relationship and research centre o Zielona Góra, famous from its studies on the communitylangugae relationship. In these studies, the starting point for all kinds of considerations are questions about language and the way it is used. Therefore, language is considered as a social tool, cultural <b>storage,</b> a <b>certificate</b> of civilizational changes, track of time and space. Custom and community, however, indicate the attitude of research and define the order of the auxiliary sciences within such language studies. It is very important to remember that one should speak about the custom both in community and individual sense every time when there is a repetition or imitation of the behavior and actions caused by identical communicative needs. That repetition and imitation manifests on all planes or layers of texts: from word formation, the phraseology and syntax, to the genre; it also addresses the functional behavior, fashions and stylistic treatments...|$|R

Digital signatures are used to provide peer and data origin authentication, and, in combination with access control lists, to provide access control. The deployed infrastructure is based on off-the-shelf available clients and servers, and provides functions for electronic registration of participants, session initialisation, user authentication, key generation and personalisation, <b>certificate</b> generation, distribution, <b>storage</b> and retrieval, <b>certificate</b> revocation lists, and auditing.

50|$|The current use of X.509v3 {{certificates}} {{outside the}} Directory structure loaded directly into web browsers {{was necessary for}} e-commerce to develop by allowing for secure web based (SSL/TLS) communications which did not require the X.500 directory {{as a source of}} digital certificates as originally conceived in X.500 (1988). One should contrast the role of X.500 and X.509 to understand their relationship in that X.509 was designed to be the secure access method for updating X.500 before the WWW, but when web browsers became popular there needed to be a simple method of encrypting connections on the transport layer to web sites. Hence the trusted root certificates for supported certificate authorities were pre loaded into <b>certificate</b> <b>storage</b> areas on the personal computer or device.|$|R
40|$|Current Digital Rights Management (DRM) {{systems support}} only two-party systems, {{involving}} the package server and purchaser. However, for a scalable business model of transacting digital assets, a multi-party DRM system is often necessary which {{involves more than}} one distributors, who can promote and distribute the content in regions unknown to the package server. We propose a key management scheme for a DRM system that involves more than one distributors with the DRM client’s flexibility of choosing a distributor according to his own preference. For instance, a mobile DRM client may contact to a distribution server who is nearest to him by location or who offers promotions/discounts on the price or offers more commissions. In our scheme, the package server does not trust the distribution servers or the license server. The encrypted digital content sent by a package server can only be decrypted by the DRM client who has a valid license and is protected from attacks by other parties/servers in the system. Moreover, we use Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) that incurs less computation cost and <b>storage</b> as <b>certificate</b> managements are not necessary and certificate verifications are no longer needed. These features make our DRM system suitable for more effective business models/applications with the flexibility in deciding {{a wide range of}} business strategies as compared to the existing works...|$|R
40|$|Effective storing, {{retrieval}} {{and interpretation}} of certificate chains is a difficult problem. The original X. 500 and X. 509 proposals, with their rigid global naming scheme and complex access protocols {{have proved to be}} less than optimal, leading to various short-cuts. For example, the de facto X. 509 retrieval protocol appears to be TCP/IP based LDAP instead of the original OSI based Directory Access Protocol, DAP. In this paper we present a completely new architecture for administration, storing and retrieval of digital certificates. Instead of X. 509 certificates we base our architecture on SPKI, a more flexible certificate format proposed by the IETF. The new architecture allows complex certificate chains to be effectively and easily administered, using the Internet Domain Name Service, or DNS, as the <b>certificate</b> <b>storage,</b> replication and retrieval mechanism. The interpretation of the certificates is based on our Internet Security Policy Daemon architecture. 1 Introduction A digital [...] ...|$|R

After IBE Attribute Based encryption (ABE) made possibility to provide multicast communication between users but it was limited to only key policy based encryption as well as could not provide the revocation phenomenon for keys.

However, the big question of key management still remains unanswered.

40|$|Securing mobile ad hoc {{networks}} (MANETs) is {{a crucial}} task for their good deployments. One fundamental aspect of providing confidentiality and authentication is key management. While Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) based solutions has provided these properties historically, MANETs are resource constrained and benefit from symmetric key encryption. In this paper, we proposed a certificateless efficient group key management scheme (CE-GKMS) in MANETs for group confidentiality which uses identity based cryptography for secure multicast group communication. The scheme does not need PKI in which mobile nodes needs large <b>storage</b> to carry <b>certificates</b> and to perform public key cryptography based large computation. The scheme introduced a new idea of hiding the public keys and making them visible only to the trusted nodes which not only {{make it difficult for}} cryptanalyst to crack the private information but also permit to keep small value of encryption and decryption component causes asymmetric cryptography operation faster. For scalability and dynamic reconfigurability, we divide the network into groups. Leaders in these groups securely communicate with each other to agree on group key in response to membership change and member mobility-induced events. The performance results prove the effectiveness of our proposed key management scheme CE-GKMS...|$|R
40|$|The {{target of}} {{compulsory}} certification in Information Security Management System has extended to medical institutions. This caused {{us to recognize}} the importance of information security in modern hospital information system that has changed from the medical record management that was recorded and managed largely in paper chart in the past to the Electronic Medical Record that medical personnel enter patient information into a computer directly for building a database. As medical institutions manage sensitive information like personal information basically, personal medical data infringement accident, if occurred can become a big social issue. Currently, the medical information in medical institutions are stored in electronic medical records and to access, user authentication is required by means of accredited certificate as security measure. Accredited certification has technical problems such as <b>certificate</b> <b>storage</b> method and security level of password and managerial problems such as certificate copy/leak/share. In this respect, this study proposes and presents how to build the FIDO-based authentication system that applies UAF or U 2 F authentication mechanism depending on the authority and work scope of medical personnel and medical support assistant like staffs, officers, licensed practical nurse and so on, within large medical institutions that use medical information system. The aim is to solve problems in accredited certificate authentication method in the existing medical institutions with the FIDO-based authentication system proposed in this study...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{detailed}} study of Elliptic Curve Cryptography Algorithm and its performance [...] ECC {{can be used with}} fewer keys to give more security, high speed in a less bandwidth. While these advantages make ECC propose for mobile devices, they can provide computational burden on secure web servers. In resource constrained system, Elliptic Curve Cryptography is a promising alternative for public algorithms, because it provides similar level of security with proposed shorter keys than conventional integer based public key algorithm. ECC over binary field is taken up with special interest because the operation in binary filed operation, are thought to be more in space and efficient in time. However, the software implementation of ECC over binary field are still slow, especially on low end processors, which are used in small computing devices such as sensors node, mobile phone, etc. This proposed paper, studied the Cryptography algorithms and software implementation of ECC. Firstly, while implementing ECC with software, the choice of some architectural parameters like word size may affect the choice of algorithms or not, has been examined. Also, identification of software for low-end processors has been done. In addition, this paper has examined several implements to the instruction that architecture of an 8 bit processor and studied their impact on the performance of ECC with other algorithms. ECC is well is well suited for high speeds, lower power consumption, bandwidth savings, <b>storage</b> efficiencies, smaller <b>certificates</b> and it reduces computational time and also the amount of data transmitted and stored, and strong security for low-power devices in wireless networks...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years it has been {{important}} for the European countries to support green energy as a countermeasure against climate changes. Norway and Sweden have chosen to implement a common green certificate market, which is a support scheme for renewable energy technology. The scheme will be a crucial contribution for Norway to abide by EUs' Renewables Directive. So far the market is doing really well and is on track to complete the goal of 26, 4 TWh new electricity production from renewables before the end of 2020. The joint certificate market is very closely connected to the power market. Therefore, the EMPS model, which is a good model of the Nordic power market, was chosen as the model to use for testing and forecasting in this thesis. The main objective has been to analyze the Norwegian-Swedish certificate market in the EMPS model with particular focus on factors that affect the green certificate price levels and price fluctuations. This has been done by adjusting and updating a realistic dataset for the Nordic power market. The historic values from the real certificate market were used as inputs and as a basis for the simulations. 10 different cases have been presented and simulated, where the main differences between them were the expansion rate of new production and the expansion of different energy sources. The results obtained from the simulations corresponded to theoretical findings about the green certificate market. Currently the <b>certificate</b> <b>storage</b> holds 13 million certificates, but it appears like it might increase towards a value of 15 million during 2015, before it will start to decrease considerably from 2016. In order to achieve different price scenarios in the simulations, the initial <b>certificate</b> <b>storage</b> needed to be lowered a great deal from the real value, so that the EMPS model could see a possibility of deficit in the future. The most ideal cases with the most even price levels were achieved when the amount of production and consumption of green certificates were as close together as possible. It was demonstrated by the simulations that the expansion rate of new production greatly influences the certificate prices. If the expansion rate is fast, a smaller probability of deficit exists, and as a result the certificate prices will be lower. The opposite is true for a slow expansion rate. The different types of production sources (hydropower, wind power and biofuels) also affected the certificate price levels in different ways, even though the storage developments were the same. When there was more hydropower expansion the average price was the lowest, but the price curve was the most extreme. Expansion in wind power lead to a higher average price, while expansion in biofuels had the most even price curve. A reason for these different price scenarios could be that both hydropower and biofuels can be adjusted in response to power prices. However, different calibrations for the EMPS model had to be performed for the different cases. It is therefore likely that this also influenced the price levels for the different types of production. All things considered, it looks as if 2015 {{is going to be a}} very important year regarding the future of the common certificate market. A lot of decisions needs to be made regarding both changes in regulation and potential new investments, which will affect whether the common goal will be met or not. The future is uncertain, but with more work and testing the EMPS model could hopefully predict some of it...|$|R
