40|$|<b>Stocks</b> <b>management</b> is an {{important}} component of the accounting works and the research thereto may be developed on several directions, considering the array of practical situations that may occur in different fields of the economic activity. A main objective of stocks volume optimization refers to the stocks establishment and maintenance under cost minimization conditions. The attainment of this ob-jective requires the harmonization of the contradictory relation between the purchasing expenses and the storage expenses. The most frequent situation in <b>stocks</b> <b>management</b> is when the spans of time be-tween purchasing are not equal, running the risk that the delivery time agreed by contract may not always be observed. In this case, the contradictory relation between profitableness and risk is ques-tionable, being necessary to make up a safety stock. A realistic solution is the one optimizing the costs generated by the safety stock establishment, considering the purchasing delay frequenc...|$|R
500|$|Ecology is an {{employed}} {{science of}} restoration, repairing disturbed sites through human intervention, in natural resource management, and in environmental impact assessments. Edward O.

Ecological science has boomed in the industrial investment of restoring ecosystems and their processes in abandoned sites after disturbance. Natural resource managers, in forestry, for example, employ ecologists to develop, adapt, and implement ecosystem based methods into the planning, operation, and restoration phases of land-use. Ecological science {{is used in the}} methods of sustainable harvesting, disease, and fire outbreak management, in fisheries <b>stock</b> <b>management,</b> for integrating land-use with protected areas and communities, and conservation in complex geo-political landscapes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{examine how}} {{corporate}} payout policy {{is affected by}} managerial stock incentives using data on more than 1100 nonfinancial firms during 1993 - 97. We find that management share ownership encourages higher payouts by firms with potentially the greatest agency problems—those with low market-to-book ratios and low <b>management</b> <b>stock</b> ownership. We also find that <b>management</b> <b>stock</b> options change the composition of payouts. We find a strong negative relationship between dividends and <b>management</b> <b>stock</b> options, as predicted by Lambert, Lannen, and Larcker (1989), and {{a positive relationship between}} repurchases and <b>management</b> <b>stock</b> options. Our results suggest that the growth in stock options may help to explain the rise in repurchases at the expense of dividends. JEL Classification: G 30; G 3...|$|R

40|$|Continuous <b>stocking</b> <b>management</b> is {{preferred}} by many New Zealand sheep farmers {{during the late}} summer-autumn period. At present, there are no guidelines available to farmers that define the optimum sward conditions for continuous <b>stocking</b> <b>management</b> of ewes leading up to, and during, the mating period. Three different nominal sward surface heights (SSH) (2, 4, and 6 cm) replicated twice were used for a trial with 14 mixed age breeding ewes per treatment (n= 84 ewes) continuously stocked from February to April 1994. The pastures consisted of predominantly 10 -year old ryegrass (Lolium perenne), white clover (Trifolium repens) and browntop (Agrostis capillaris). Sward heights were measured weekly throughout the trial. Herbage intakes by the ewes were determined indirectly from faecal output using chromic oxide controlled release capsules and in vitro digestibility of digesta samples obtained from oesophageal-fistulated sheep run with the ewes. The average actual sward surface heights for the 2, 4, and 6 cm SSH treatments were 2. 7 vs 4. 3 vs 6. 1 cm (± 0. 05 cm (SEM), P 0. 1). The results suggest that swards of at least at 6 cm height are required to support adequate liveweight gain and condition score of breeding ewes in the period prior to and during mating. The accumulation of weed and dead material {{appear to be the}} major problems limiting intake and ewe performance...|$|R
