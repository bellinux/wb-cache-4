A credible threat to exclude borrowers who default more than a certain number of times from participating in the capital markets makes international debt contracts incentive compatible.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} thermal {{magnetization}} reversal processes in magnetic grains. Two experiments are carried out: <b>swtiching</b> time and switching field experiments. In both cases, {{we find that}} the simulated behavior is coherent with existing experimental data (the streched exponent of the switching time experiment increases with the temperature and is superior to unity; there exists a master curve for the switching field experiment). Moreover, we simulated magnetic grains in a region of parameters where no experimental data are available. We find that the relaxation time distribution P(ln τ) is gaussian, and we find the existence of a strong field regime. Content...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel ultrafast {{electronic}} switching device based on dual-graphene electron waveguides, in analogy to the optical dual-channel waveguide device. The design utilizes {{the principle of}} coherent quantum mechanical tunneling of Rabi oscillations between the two graphene electron waveguides. Based on a modified coupled mode theory, we construct a theoretical model to analyse the device characteristics, and predict that the <b>swtiching</b> speed is faster than 1 ps. Due to the long mean free path of electrons in graphene at room temperature, the proposed design avoids the limitation of low temperature operation required in the normal semiconductor quantum-well structure.

These changes have placed significant pressures on farmers and processors including more stringent quality control and product varieties. The government {{has launched a}} rice production-marketing contract program in 2005 to assist rice farmers and the agro-business sector to work together as partners. The minimum scale for each contract is 50 hectares of adjacent rice paddies with 50 participants including rice farmers, seedling providers, millers and marketing agents. In order to evaluate {{the outcome of this}} program, a survey is conducted in the summer of 2005 after the first (spring) crop is harvested. Information of price and value of output and major variable and fixed inputs are collected along with characteristics of the farmers and farms. The survey results show that the average revenue of a contract farm is about 11 percent higher than an average non-contract farm. The per hectare cost of production in a contract farm is about 13 percent lower and as a result the average profit margin under contract is more than 50 percent above those without contract. A <b>swtiching</b> regression profit frontier model is adopted to further investigate their efficiency performance. The result indicates that an average contract farms is 20 percent more efficient than an average non-contract farm in a comparable operating environment. The result also suggests that although contract farming has potential to improve the profit of smallholders, it is not a sufficient condition for such improvement. Land Economics/Use,...|$|R

Aiming at {{the severe}} effect of poly-silicon {{deposition}} process {{on the performance}} of polysilicon <b>swtich,</b> experiments were made on optimization of poly-silicon deposition and releasing the stress of polysilicon beams to obtain optimal process conditions. By using the optimizing process, the fabrication process for polysilicon mechanical switch is designed, and a poly-silicon micromachined RF MEMS(radio frequency microelectronic machined system) switch has been fabricated. The switch is tested, the results are as follows: the off-state capacitance and on-state capacitance are 0. 1 p F and 2. 5 p F, respectively, and the pull down voltage is 45 V. Those optimizing key process technology for fabrication polysilicon mechanical switches is useful, and will be a base for developing RF switch systems with IC...|$|E
40|$|Two {{homologous}} GTP-bindin proteins, atToc 33 and atToc 159, {{control access}} of cytosolic precursor proteins to the chloroplast, at Toc 33 is a constitutive outer chloroplast membrane protein, whereas the precusor receptor atToc 159 {{may be able}} to switch between a soluble and an integral membrane form. By transient expression of GFP fusion proteins, mutant analysis, and biochemical experimentation, we demonstrate that the GTP-binding domain regulates the targeting of cytosolic atToc 159 to the chloroplast and mediates the switch between cytosolic and integral membrane forms. Mutant atToc 159, unable to bind GTP, does not reinstate a green phenotype in an albino mutant (ppi 2) lacking endogenous atToc 159, remaining trapped in the cytosol. Thus, the function of atToc 159 in chloroplast biogenesis is dependent on an intrinsic GTP-regulated <b>swtich</b> that controls localization of the receptor to the chloroplast envelope...|$|E
40|$|African American Vernacular English (AAVE) {{has been}} a {{controversial}} topic {{when it comes to}} African American children learning in the classroom. AAVE has been linked to African American children’s low performance scores in reading and writing. However, research has shown that {{this may not be the}} case. Although AAVE may not be the accepted form of English, or language in American society when it comes to academia, the difference in the dialect does not change the meaning’s context. This study examines whether African American children were able to code switch between AAVE and Standard English (SE). It includes four African American participants: two males and two females. Data analysis included dialogue scripts created from authentic conversations, formal and informal writing assignments, and observation notes. Findings indicate that students do know how and when to code <b>swtich</b> between AAVE and SE. Teachers must make sure that they immerse their African American students in both of the dialects. Therefore, students’ cultural identities will not be lost in AAVE, and they will learn how to continue to code switching to SE when appropriate...|$|E
40|$|Switch {{costs are}} {{generally}} found in language switching tasks. However, the locus where switch costs occur during bilingual language production remains unclear. Several studies that used a cued language-switching paradigm {{have attempted to}} investigate this question in bilingual language production, but researchers have not reached a consensus. Moreover, {{we are interested in}} where switch costs occur when language selection occurs after lemma activation. Previous studies have not investigated this question because most previous studies presented language cues before or along with the stimuli. Therefore, we used a modified cued language-switching paradigm with a combined event-related potential (ERP) technique to explore the locus of <b>swtich</b> costs during bilingual language production. The cue and stimulus were separated and presented in two different presentation sequences in which Indonesian-Chinese bilingual speakers were instructed to name digits in their L 1 or L 2 according to the color of the cue. The ERPs related to the cue and the stimulus for two presentation sequences were measured. In the stimulus-cue sequence, the analysis that was time-locked to cues revealed a reversed switch cost as early as 220 ms after the cue onset; furthermore, a switch cost was shown in L 1 with a late stage post-cue onset. The results suggested that when language selection occurred after lemma activation, the switch costs mainly occurred at the lemma selection stage. In the cue-stimulus sequence, the analysis that was time-locked to cues did not reveal significant main effects of switching, whereas the ERPs that were time-locked to digits yielded a switch cost, again indicating that switch costs mainly occurred at the lemma selection stage rather than at the language task schema competition stage. Overall, our results indicated that when bilinguals read digits aloud in the language switching task, switch costs mainly occurred at the lemma selection stage...|$|E
40|$|Introduction In Summer 2014 Intelligent Health {{delivered}} ‘Beat the Street’ in Reading {{with the}} aim to get a whole community more physically active. Beat the Street turns the town into a real life game where players register their walking and cycling journeys by tapping a smartcard on 220 RFID readers called ‘Beat Boxes’ placed on lampposts around the town. Players monitor their progress via a website where they can see their own and their team’s progress, and the overall target. The project was re-commissioned in June 2015. Methods Participants were recruited through and via schools, receiving a smartcard for themselves and family members from their teacher and a map of Beat Box locations. Recruitment also took place from community groups, workplaces and GP surgeries. Participants who were not pre-registered through their school registered online. During the registration process {{they were able to}} pick a team for their points to be awarded to. 10 points were awarded for every valid journey between two Beat Boxes which were placed at key destinations across the town, approximately 0. 5 miles apart. Points contributed to individual and team scores. During registration, participants completed a questionnaire which included a single item physical activity question. (i) Follow up surveys took place {{at the end of the}} game and 3 months later. Registration from the 2015 game were used to compare results between participants who took part in both years. The results were analysed by an independent team at The Evidence Centre. Results In 2014, 15, 000 people in 50 teams walked and cycled 244, 537 miles in 8 weeks. There were 8000 children and 7000 adults. 12 % of adults had a long-term condition such as COPD, arthritis or diabetes. In 2015, the number of participants increased by 63 % to 24, 074. In 2015 they walked 303, 000 miles. In 2014, 1051 completed the single item p. a. question both before and after the competition. There was a 10 % increase (0. 05). The changes remained when data from individuals was matched. 78 % of people said Beat the Street helped them to walk more than usual and 70 % said they continued to walk more after Beat the Street ended. 76 % of people said they would try to continue the changes after the competition ended and 3 months later 75 % said they continued to be more active. The main reason given for taking part was ‘having fun’ or ‘keeping fit’. At the beginning of the game in 2015, 46 % of those who had taken part before reported meeting 150 mins/week compared to 40 % of people who had not taken part before. (> 0. 05) At the end of Beat the Street in 2015, the trends were even more positive. Both people participating for the first-time and those who had taken part before were more likely to be meeting the p. a. target at the end– but past participants had even greater gains than first-timers. Discussion and Conclusion Beat the Street may help people make some immediate changes to their p. a. levels. These changes may be sustained one year later. With repeated participation in Beat the Street, activity levels may increase even further. Further analysis is currently underway to explore walking speed, as an objective measure of fitness, in the 2015 cohort and sub-groups thereof, in particular the least active and those with a long term condition or in the older age categories. Since 2014, 107, 000 people have played Beat the Street across 11 projects. It is one of the initiatives being tested as part of the EU-funded <b>SWTICH</b> campaign to enhance active travel through technology and health messages. The cost per participant of Beat the Street in Reading was € 8 and this means that for every € 1 spent over two years there was a return of € 21. 48 for health, € 5. 21 for transport and € 24. 15 for economic productivity. This gives a total of € 48 return for every € 1 spent. (ii...|$|E
