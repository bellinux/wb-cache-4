After his release from solitary, Andy explains that hope is what gets him through his time, a concept that Red dismisses. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting <b>skilled</b> <b>labor</b> costs and receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias Randall Stephens.|$|E

Such activities were overseen by SEATO's Committee of Information, Culture, Education, and Labor Activities, and proved to be some of SEATO's greatest successes. In 1959, SEATO's first Secretary General, Pote Sarasin, created the SEATO Graduate School of Engineering (currently the Asian Institute of Technology) in Thailand to train engineers. SEATO also sponsored {{the creation of the}} Teacher Development Center in Bangkok, as well as the Thai Military Technical Training School, which offered technical programs for supervisors and workmen. SEATO's <b>Skilled</b> <b>Labor</b> Project (SLP) created artisan training facilities, especially in Thailand, where ninety-one training workshops were established.|$|E

40|$|The Multinomial Logit {{model is}} {{employed}} {{in this study}} {{to examine the relationship}} of the choices of technology strategies adopted by the manufacturing firms in Taiwan. The technology strategies are divided into four categories: "both R&D and purchased technology", "only R&D", "only purchased technology", and "none of R&D and purchased technology". Based on the data from the manufacturing survey of 2001 Industry, Commerce and Service Census, the empirical results in this study suggest that the willingness of choosing technology strategies is found in those larger firm size companies; at a higher ratio of <b>skilled</b> <b>labors,</b> and at a higher ratio of export. More specifically, in contrast to the firms with "only R&D", firms with larger firm size and older firm age tend to engage in "both R&D and purchased technology"; firms with a smaller firm size, at a lower ratio of <b>skilled</b> <b>labors,</b> and with more foreign direct investment tend to engage in "only purchased technology". technology strategy, research and development, purchased technology...|$|R
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or <b>skilled</b> <b>labor</b> is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E

The brigade supports operations conducted by the 82nd Airborne Division. It is part of Task Force Rugged, and among its duties are training Afghan citizens in <b>skilled</b> <b>labor</b> and other nationbuilding operations. Most of the brigade served in Afghanistan since February 2007, while {{other elements of the}} unit served in Iraq. While in Afghanistan, the brigade headquarters were stationed at Forward Operating Base Sharana. It also began to undertake missions against Improvised Explosive Devices, a problem which had originated in Iraq but since became more of a threat in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|While {{the loss}} of <b>skilled</b> <b>labor</b> {{represents}} a potential cost for countries of origin, it can also at times be beneficial. For instance, {{if there is no}} room in the economy of the home country to use the <b>skilled</b> <b>labor,</b> then it is better for the workers to migrate and send back remittances. When these remittances are greater than what the migrant would have made in the home country, it is also beneficial. Another example is when the migrants return with new skills, knowledge, and capacities. Lastly, the movement of <b>skilled</b> <b>labor</b> is beneficial for the country of origin when migrants forge strong economic connections between the home and host country.|$|E

40|$|By {{making use}} of a simple general {{equilibrium}} model of a small open economy, the author examines the link between labor mobility {{and the size of}} wage inequality in the presence of productive public infrastructure. The paper shows that the provision of public infrastructure plays an important part in determining the size of labor inflow induced wage inequality. Specifically, it shows that, irrespective of the relative factor intensities, a small inflow of either <b>skilled</b> or unskilled <b>labor</b> does not affect the size of wage inequality if private industries derive equal benefits from public infrastructure provision. A small inflow of <b>skilled</b> (unskilled) <b>labor</b> increases (decreases) wage inequality if <b>skilled</b> (unskilled) <b>labor</b> intensive industry derives more benefits from public infrastructure.

We find that while <b>skilled</b> <b>labor’s</b> pattern of reallocation into the public sector remains roughly the same over time, the inflow of highly educated laborers into the private sector and selfemployment increases. These changes coincide with the erosion of the returns to observed skills in the private sector and self-employment, while the public sector continues to reward all types of education at higher than the elementary level. employment selection, earnings, Bulgaria...|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} function consists of nine components, given in Eqs. (1.1)–(1.9), seeks {{to minimize the}} sum of miscellaneous costs. Term (1.1) demonstrates sum of constant cost of all machines which have been used over the planning horizon for entire cells. Term (1.2) shows the total purchase cost minus selling income for entire machines during all periods. Term (1.3) indicates the variable cost of processing operations by different machines in whole cells and periods. Terms (1.4) and (1.5) calculate inter-cell and intra-cell movement costs, respectively. Term (1.6) represents the total costs for overtime working of machines which is required to produce the partial fraction of demand. Term (1.7) demonstrates the total costs of shifting labors between cells over the planning horizon. Various parameters such as labors training, wage rate of <b>skilled</b> <b>labors</b> and labors transference among the cells affect this expenditure. Term (1.8) indicates the cost of machines relocations. Finally, the last term of the {{objective function}} considers inventory holding costs.

Lai (1995) -a generalization of the Grossman and Helpman (1991 a,b, ch. 11) models-showed that the relative wage of <b>skilled</b> (unskilled) <b>labor</b> in a region is positively (negatively) related to the supply of <b>skilled</b> (unskilled) <b>labor</b> in that region. These surprising results depend crucially on the specification of the functional form of the Southern imitation activity.

30|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} trend toward construction of buildings using precast concrete. In precast concrete construction, all the components of structures are produced in controlled environment and they are transported to the site. At site such individual components are connected appropriately. This leads to speedy construction, reduced formwork and scaffolding, less requirement of <b>skilled</b> <b>labors,</b> reduced construction waste, better quality, and better surface finishing as compared to normal reinforced concrete construction. Because of such advantages the precast concrete construction is being adopted world-wide including India. In precast concrete construction, connections are the most critical elements of the structure, because in past major collapse of precast building took place because of connection failure. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to study the performance of connection between beam and column under a progressive collapse scenario.|$|R
