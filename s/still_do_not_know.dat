Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, {{many of which are}} otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies and installation of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{research}} linking friendship and health, but the precise reasons for the connection remain unclear. Most of the studies in this area are large prospective studies that follow people over time, and while there may be a correlation between the two variables (friendship and health status), researchers <b>still</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> if there is a cause and effect relationship, such as the notion that good friendships actually improve health. A number of theories have attempted to explain this link. These theories have included that good friends encourage their friends to lead more healthy lifestyles; that good friends encourage their friends to seek help and access services when needed; that good friends enhance their friends' coping skills in dealing with illness and other health problems; and that good friends actually affect physiological pathways that are protective of health.|$|E

500|$|Walter {{continues}} his {{theory that the}} virus wants to escape the building, hence the multiple escape attempts by the infected. The virus was found on a sample taken 10 miles below the earth, and may be 75,000 years old and responsible for wiping out the Ice Age mammals.

2500|$|There {{is never}} {{complete}} agreement about music as controversial as City of Glass, only {{a consensus on}} either side. [...] Asked by English record aficionado Colin Goodall, trumpeter Buddy Childers was explicit: [...] "Either you do have the intellectual capacity to appreciate the music, or it is bullshit,"...so Childers was asked his opinion, [...] "It's bullshit." [...] Stan Kenton adamantly defended Graettinger's music but later had his doubts. [...] Stan Kenton, [...] "Well, I tell ya, it was either the greatest music the band ever presented, or the biggest pile of crap we ever played, and I <b>still</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> which." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{report by}} Forests Monitor and Rainforest Foundation {{published}} in 2007 [...] {{found that there}} is little evidence that industrial logging alleviates poverty, but instead actually contributes to it. [...] This is mainly due to access to forest areas becoming restricted and money not filtering down to local people. [...] “Keeping in mind that the Law only provides for conservation of 15% of the DRC’s forests and that more than 40% are earmarked for commercial logging, we <b>still</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> what percentage of Congolese forests are to be returned back to the indigenous communities to enable them to practice their cultural and socio-economic activities” (Byayuwa).|$|E
2500|$|More recently, {{in vitro}} data in animal models {{suggests}} intravenous ascorbic acid at high doses may hold some promise {{in the treatment}} of cancer; however, this has not been supported in more rigorous clinical trials in humans. [...] Preliminary clinical trials in humans have shown that it is unlikely to be a [...] "miracle pill" [...] for cancer and more research is necessary before any definitive conclusions about efficacy can be reached. [...] A 2010 review of 33 years of research on vitamin C to treat cancer stated [...] "we have to conclude that we <b>still</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> whether Vitamin C has any clinically significant antitumor activity. Nor do we know which histological types of cancers, if any, are susceptible to this agent.

2500|$|Concern {{with the}} {{legislation}} arose {{because of the}} authoritarian nature of the Chinese government: the new law invokes concepts of treason against the PRC in certain circumstances. Critics claimed that the legislation will erode freedom of speech. Suspicions have been exacerbated by the refusal {{of the government to}} issue a white paper on the legislation, causing groups such as Amnesty International to declare that it had [...] "grave concerns about the proposals in the government's consultation document and the lack of a draft white paper which means that the public <b>still</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> how the legislation will actually be worded." [...] The government will be required to issue a blue paper containing the draft legislation when it presents the new bill to the Hong Kong Legislative Council ("Legco"), but this would leave no time for the public to voice its concerns, and the government may use its unelected majority in Legco to rush the bill through.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} years of the state of Israel the village was {{subjected}} to repeated searches by the army and anyone who had not registered as resident in November 1948 could be expelled. One case attracted a lot of public criticism. In June 1950, the IDF and police rounded up 105 men and women believed to be infiltrators were deported to Jordan. In an open letter to the Knesset, the inhabitants of Abu Ghosh claimed that the army had [...] "surrounded our village, and taken our women, children and old folk, and thrown them over the border and into the Negev Desert, and many of them died in consequence, when they were shot [...] the borders." [...] The letter further stated that they woke up to [...] "shouts blaring over the loudspeaker announcing that the village was surrounded and anyone trying to get out would be shot....The police and military forces then began to enter the houses and conduct meticulous searches, but no contraband was found. In the end, using force and blows, they gathered up our women, and old folk and children, the sick and the blind and pregnant women. These shouted for help but there was no saviour. And we looked on and were powerless to do anything save beg for mercy. Alas, our pleas were of no avail... They then took the prisoners, who were weeping and screaming, to an unknown place, and we <b>still</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> what befell them." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the end of}} the War, Surendranath Banerjee, {{followed}} by Barin Ghose and Motilal Roy, successfully negotiated the withdrawal of warrants against the fugitives accused of the Indo-German plot. Atul was adamant in obtaining a promise on these points : (a) there would be no question of surrendering arms; (b) no questions would be raised on their past activities; (c) no parole would be demanded concerning their future conducts. Atul came out in 1921. But his Dada’s (Jatin Mukherjee’s) heroic death, [...] "had knocked out his revolutionary ardour and he gave up active politics." [...] Yet, in January 1924, when Gopinath Saha killed an Englishman, mistaking him to be Tegart, the much-hated Commissioner of Kolkata Police (reputed to have shot Jatin Mukherjee dead), Atul was made a state-prisoner, to be released in 1926. The same year he married Menokarani Rakshit of Majilpur, 24 Parganas and took to business, dissociating himself completely from politics. They had no issues. In an interview with Prithwindra Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin's grandson), on 27 October 1963 - shortly before his death -, Atul sighed: [...] "Dada was a magnet; we all, iron scraps, received our energy from him. When he was no more, we all became iron scraps. I <b>still</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> whether my first allegiance went to Dada, or to the Motherland." [...] Asked about the source of Jatindranath's tremendous force, Atul replied: [...] "He was a very well trained wrestler and an all-round sportsman. But what characterised him was his soul force and his power of concentration. He could pin-point all his energy to a single part of his body, for instance his fist. A single blow from that fist was equivalent to an electric charge of God knows how many volts!" ...|$|E

And why should either the 'sensory centre' or the 'central terminus' just {{once in a lifetime}} develop this uncanny activity, and represent to us a person to whom we may be wholly indifferent?

60|$|From {{the letter}} of Louvois to Fouquet, about Dauger (December 23, 1678), it is plain that Louis XIV. had no more {{pressing}} anxiety, nine years after Dauger's arrest, than to conceal WHAT IT WAS THAT DAUGER HAD DONE. It is apparent that Saint-Mars himself either was unacquainted with this secret, or was supposed by Louvois and the King to be unaware of it. He had been ordered never to allow Dauger to tell him: he {{was not allowed to}} see the letters on the subject between Louvois and Fouquet. We <b>still</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know,</b> and never shall know, whether Dauger himself knew his own secret, or whether (as he had anticipated) he was locked up for not divulging what he did not know.|$|E

6000|$|But we <b>still</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> how {{the horse}} and mare came in, or why the statue of Demeter had a horse's head. 'This seems simply {{to be due to}} the fact that, quite apart from this myth, the sun had, in India at least, often been {{conceived}} as a horse [...] . and the dawn had been likened to a mare.' But how does this explain the problem? The Vedic poets cited (ii. 542) either referred to the myth which we have to explain, or they used a poetical expression, knowing perfectly well what they meant. As long as they knew what they meant, they could not make an unseemly fable out of a poetical phrase. Not till after the meaning was forgotten could the myth arise. But the myth existed already in the Veda! And the unseemliness is precisely what we have to account for; that is our enigma.|$|E
