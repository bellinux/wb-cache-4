50|$|The fungi causing stigmatomycosis are {{associated}} with hemipteran insects of the <b>stinkbug</b> families Pentatomidae and Coreidae. Hemipterans are common pests in pistachio orchards, and up to ten species {{have been found in}} California pistachio orchards. Three common <b>stinkbug</b> pests, Thyanta pallidovirens (Western red-shouldered <b>stinkbug),</b> Chlorochroa uhleri, Chlorochroa ligata, and a leaffooted bug, Leptoglossus clypealis (Coreidae), experimentally transmitted E. coryli, which caused typical symptoms of stigmatomycosis in pistachio kernels. Symptoms first appear in late June after pistachio shells have hardened, but the disease becomes frequent in July through September, a period that coincides with kernel development. Smaller hemipterans, such as Lygus and Calocoris, may carry but not transmit the pathogens because they are unable to puncture the firm fruit pericarp after the second part of May. Stigmatomycosis and kernel necrosis are worse in orchards irrigated by sprinklers than in those irrigated by drip, microjets, or flood. This suggests either greater humidity requirements for infection, more activity of hemipterans in sprinkler-irrigated orchards, or more abundant pathogen propagules.|$|E

50|$|In China, Trissolcus japonicus, a {{parasitoid}} wasp {{species in}} the family Scelionidae, is a primary predator. This species is not currently present in the U.S., but is undergoing study for possible introduction. The major problem with this idea {{is the possibility that}} japonicus will also become an invasive species with no native predators. Before introducing the Chinese wasp, scientists are trying to find natural predators of the stink bug already present in the United States. To do so they have studied other species of parasitoid wasps native to the United States. They found that several other species of the parasitoid wasps attacked stink bug eggs in Virginia soybean fields. Researchers have also experimented with different spider species as well as the Wheel bug. Several spider species attacked both the eggs as well as live stink bugs. Pill bugs eat <b>stinkbug</b> eggs. The Wheel bug, however, was the most voracious predator and attacked the eggs as well as stink bugs more consistently. Scientists are hoping that other animals such as birds will eventually begin preying on stink bugs as populations continue to rise.|$|E
50|$|Hemiptera form prey to predators {{including}} vertebrates, such as birds, {{and other}} invertebrates such as ladybirds. In response, hemipterans have evolved antipredator adaptations. Ranatra may feign death (thanatosis). Others such as Carpocoris purpureipennis secrete toxic fluids {{to ward off}} arthropod predators; some Pentatomidae such as Dolycoris are able to direct these fluids at an attacker. Toxic cardenolide compounds are accumulated by the heteropteran Oncopeltus fasciatus when it consumes milkweeds, while the coreid <b>stinkbug</b> Amorbus rubiginosus acquires 2-hexenal from its food plant, Eucalyptus. Some long-legged bugs mimic twigs, rocking to and fro to simulate the motion of a plant part in the wind. The nymph of the Masked hunter bug camouflages itself with sand grains, using its hind legs and tarsal fan to form a double layer of grains, coarser on the outside. The Amazon rain forest cicada Hemisciera maculipennis display bright red deimatic flash coloration on their hindwings when threatened; the sudden contrast helps to startle predators, giving the cicadas time to escape. The coloured patch on the hindwing is concealed at rest by an olive green patch {{of the same size}} on the forewing, enabling the insect to switch rapidly from cryptic to deimatic behaviour.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} mirids and <b>stinkbugs</b> {{have emerged as}} {{important}} sucking pests in cotton. While <b>stinkbugs</b> are causing damage to bolls, mirids are causing damage to seedlings, squares and bolls. With the increasing adoption of Bollgard II and IPM approaches the use of broad-spectrum chemicals to kill Helicoverpa has been reduced {{and as a result}} mirids and <b>stinkbugs</b> are building to levels causing damage to bolls later in crop growth stages. Studies on <b>stinkbugs</b> by Dr Moazzem Khan revealed that green vegetable bug (GVB) caused significant boll damage and yield loss. A preliminary study by Dr Khan on mirids revealed that high mirid numbers at later growth stages also caused significant boll damage and that damage caused by mirids and GVB were similar. Mirids and <b>stinkbugs</b> therefore demand greater attention in order to minimise losses caused by these pests and to develop IPM strategies against these pests to enhance gains in IPM that have been made with Bt-transgenic cotton. Progress in this area of research will maintain sustainability and profitability of the Australian cotton industry. Mirid damage at early growth stages of cotton (up to squaring stage) has been studied in detail by Dr Khan. He found that all ages of mirids cause damage to young plants and damage by mirid nymphs is cumulative. Maximum damage occurs when the insect reaches the 4 th and 5 th nymphal stages. He also found that mirid feeding causes shedding of small and medium squares, and damaged large squares develop as ‘parrot beak’ bolls. Detailed studies at the boll stage, such as which stage of mirids is most damaging or which age boll is most vulnerable to feeding, is lacking. This information is a prerequisite to developing an IPM strategy for the pest in later crop growth stages. Understanding population change of the pest over time in relation to crop development is an important aspect for developing management strategies for the pest which is lacking for mirids in BollgardII. Predators and parasitoids are integral components of any IPM system and play an important part in regulating pest populations. Some generalist predators such as ants, spiders, damsel bugs and assassin bugs are known to predate on mirids. Nothing is known about parasitoids of mirids. Since green mirid (GM), Creontiades dilutus, is indigenous to Australia it is likely that we have one or more parasitoids of this mirid in Australia, but that possibility has not been investigated yet. The impact of the GVB adult parasitoid, Trichopoda giacomelli, has been studied by Dr Khan who found that the fly is established in the released areas and continues to spread. However, to get wider and greater impact, the fly should be released in new locations across the valleys. The insecticides registered for mirids and <b>stinkbugs</b> are mostly non-selective and are extremely disruptive {{to a wide range of}} beneficial insects. Use of these insecticides at stage I and II will minimise the impact of existing IPM programs. Therefore less disruptive control tactics including soft chemicals for mirids and <b>stinkbugs</b> are necessary. As with soft chemicals, salt mixtures, biopesticides based on fungal pathogens and attractants based on plant volatiles may be useful tools in managing mirids and <b>stinkbugs</b> with less or no disruption. Dr Khan has investigated salt mixture against mirids and GVB. While salt mixtures are quite effective and less disruptive, they are quite chemical specific. Not all chemicals mixed with salt will give the desired benefit. Therefore further investigation is needed to identify those chemicals that are effective with salt mixture against mirids and 3 of 37 GVB. Dr Caroline Hauxwell of DPI&F is working on fungal pathogen-based biopesticides against mirids and GVB and Drs Peter Gregg and Alice Del Socorro of Australian Cotton CRC are working on plant volatile-based attractants against mirids. Depending on their findings, inclusion of fungal-based biopestcides and plant volatile-based attractants in developing a management system against mirids and <b>stinkbugs</b> in cotton could be an important component of an IPM approach...|$|R

40|$|Symbiotic {{associations}} with midgut bacteria have been {{commonly found in}} diverse phytophagous heteropteran groups, where microbiological characterization of the symbiotic bacteria has been restricted to the <b>stinkbug</b> families Acanthosomatidae, Plataspidae, Pentatomidae, Alydidae, and Pyrrhocoridae. Here we investigated the midgut bacterial symbiont of Cantao ocellatus, a <b>stinkbug</b> of the family Scutelleridae. A specific gammaproteobacterium was consistently identified from the insects of different geographic origins. The bacterium was detected in all 116 insects collected from 9 natural host populations. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the bacterium constitutes a distinct lineage in the Gammaproteobacteria, not closely related to gut symbionts of other stinkbugs. Diagnostic PCR and in situ hybridization demonstrated that the bacterium is extracellularly located in the midgut 4 th section with crypts. Electron microscopy of the crypts revealed a peculiar histological configuration at the host-symbiont interface. Egg sterilization experiments confirmed that the bacterium is vertically transmitted to <b>stinkbug</b> nymphs via egg surface contamination. In addition to the gut symbiont, some individuals of C. ocellatus harbored another bacterial symbiont in their gonads, which was closely related to Sodalis glossinidius, the secondary endosymbiont of tsetse flies. Biological aspects of the primary gut symbiont and the secondary Sodalis-allied symbiont are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Genome {{reduction}} {{has been}} widely studied in obligate intracellular bacterial mutualists of insects because they have, in comparison to closely-related, nonhost-associated bacteria, extremely small genomes. Pentatomid stinkbugs also maintain bacterial symbionts, yet they are extracellular, residing within host-derived crypts, and are transmitted to offspring outside of the host's tissues, which exposes them to the external environment. In this review, we explore how the biphasic lifestyle of <b>stinkbug</b> symbionts (e. g. on the surfaces of eggs in various matrices during transmission and inside host-derived tissues {{during much of the}} host's life), in contrast with the solely intracellular lifestyle of many insect endosymbionts, may impact their genome's architecture, size and content. Furthermore, we demonstrate how additional <b>stinkbug</b> symbiont genomes are needed to more fully explore these questions and the potential value of the stinkbug-symbiont system in understanding genome evolution and reduction in the absence of intracellularity...|$|E
40|$|The <b>stinkbug</b> Cavelerius saccharivorus, which harbors Burkholderia species {{capable of}} {{degrading}} the organophosphorus insecticide, fenitrothion, {{has been identified}} on a Japanese island in farmers ’ sugarcane fields that {{have been exposed to}} fenitrothion. A clearer understanding of the ecology of the symbiotic fenitrothion degraders of Burkholderia species in a free-living environment is vital for advancing our knowledge on the establishment of degrader-stinkbug symbiosis. In the present study, we analyzed the composition and abundance of degraders in sugarcane fields on the island. Degraders were recovered from field samples without an enrichment culture procedure. Degrader densities in the furrow soil in fields varied due to differences in insecticide treatment histories. Over 99 % of the 659 isolated degraders belonged to the genus Burkholderia. The strains related to the <b>stinkbug</b> symbiotic group predominated among the degraders, indicating a selection for this group in response to fenitrothion. Degraders were also isolated from sugarcane stems, leaves, and rhizosphere in fields that were continuously exposed to fenitrothion.

40|$|Abstract Background Host-symbiont co-speciation and reductive genome {{evolution}} {{have been}} commonly observed among obligate endocellular insect symbionts, while such examples have rarely been identified among extracellular ones, the only case reported being from gut symbiotic bacteria of <b>stinkbugs</b> {{of the family}} Plataspidae. Considering that gut symbiotic communities are vulnerable to invasion of foreign microbes, gut symbiotic associations have been thought to be evolutionarily not stable. <b>Stinkbugs</b> of the family Acanthosomatidae harbor a bacterial symbiont in the midgut crypts, the lumen of which is completely sealed off from the midgut main tract, thereby retaining the symbiont in the isolated cryptic cavities. We investigated histological, ecological, phylogenetic, and genomic aspects of the unique gut symbiosis of the acanthosomatid <b>stinkbugs.</b> Results Phylogenetic analyses showed that the acanthosomatid symbionts constitute a distinct clade in the γ- Proteobacteria, whose sister groups are the obligate endocellular symbionts of aphids Buchnera and the obligate gut symbionts of plataspid <b>stinkbugs</b> Ishikawaella. In addition to the midgut crypts, the symbionts were located {{in a pair of}} peculiar lubricating organs associated with the female ovipositor, by which the symbionts are vertically transmitted via egg surface contamination. The symbionts were detected not from ovaries but from deposited eggs, and surface sterilization of eggs resulted in symbiont-free hatchlings. The symbiont-free insects suffered retarded growth, high mortality, and abnormal morphology, suggesting important biological roles of the symbiont for the host insects. The symbiont phylogeny was generally concordant with the host phylogeny, indicating host-symbiont co-speciation over evolutionary time despite the extracellular association. Meanwhile, some local host-symbiont phylogenetic discrepancies were found, suggesting occasional horizontal symbiont transfers across the host lineages. The symbionts exhibited AT-biased nucleotide composition, accelerated molecular evolution, and reduced genome size, as has been observed in obligate endocellular insect symbionts. Conclusion Comprehensive studies of the acanthosomatid bacterial symbiosis provide new insights into the genomic evolution of extracellular symbiotic bacteria: host-symbiont co-speciation and drastic genome reduction can occur not only in endocellular symbiotic associations but also in extracellular ones. We suggest that many more such cases might be discovered in future surveys. </p...|$|R
