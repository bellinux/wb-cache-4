5|$|McDowell's {{statement}} of admission {{was published in}} David McKittrick's book Lost Lives:"There was very little planning. I only came into it because of my UDR connection {{and the fact that}} I had a uniform. I was given a <b>sub-machine</b> <b>gun</b> but I had never fired it. I passed out when the explosion happened and that was when I lost the gun, the glasses, and a UDR beret".|$|E
5|$|In June 2016 it was {{revealed}} that a five-man New IRA hit team were in Dublin's north inner city looking to murder two leading gangsters after one of their associates was shot dead in a gangland feud. Sources said the murder squad from the North spent several days and nights looking for their targets in the streets. In September 2016 a close associate of Alan Ryan, who had been arrested and imprisoned following the Stamullen raid, was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment in Belfast for possession of a <b>sub-machine</b> <b>gun</b> and ammunition, after getting off a bus from Dublin.|$|E
5|$|After a brief stay in Sydney {{where the}} battalion's {{equipment}} deficiencies were made good and some reinforcements were received from local recruit training depots, they embarked again on 10 January in company with HMAS Canberra, and proceeded through the Bass Strait. As {{they were under}} way, the troops were kept occupied with training on the Bren light machine gun and the Thompson <b>sub-machine</b> <b>gun,</b> quantities of which were hastily added to the battalion's equipment scale. They reached Fremantle, Western Australia, on 15 January and overnight, {{a large number of}} 2/4th men defied orders to stay aboard ship and went ashore to spend time with their families; when the Aquitania sailed the next day, 94 men were left behind. The situation in Malaya was grave as the Japanese were steadily pushing the British and Commonwealth defenders south down the peninsula and as the gravity of the situation dawned upon the Australian government, a knee-jerk reaction saw the dispatch of 150 partially trained reinforcements from Northam. They arrived just as the Aquitania departed, being ferried out to Rottnest Island where they joined the ship's company late in the afternoon of 16 January. Although the reinforcements made good the men that had been left behind, they were only partially trained and ill-prepared for the fighting that would follow.|$|E

5|$|Imam Ahmad bin Yahya {{inherited}} the Yemeni throne in 1948. In 1955, Iraq-trained Colonel Ahmad Thalaya led a revolt against him. A {{group of soldiers}} under his command surrounded the royal palace of Al Urdhi at Taiz, a fortified stronghold where the Imam lived with his harem, the royal treasure, an arsenal of modern weapons, and a 150 strong palace-guard, and demanded Ahmad's abdication. Ahmad agreed, but demanded that his son, Muhammad al-Badr succeed him. Thalaya refused, preferring the king's half brother, the Emir Saif el Islam Abdullah, the 48-year-old Foreign Minister. While Abdullah began forming a new government, Ahmad opened the treasury coffers and secretly began buying off the besieging soldiers. After five days, the number of besiegers was reduced from 600 to 40. Ahmad then {{came out of the}} palace, wearing a devil's mask and wielding a long scimitar, terrifying the besiegers. He slashed two sentries dead before exchanging the sword for a <b>sub-machine</b> <b>gun</b> and leading his 150 guards onto the roof of the palace to begin a direct attack on the rebels. After 28 hours, 23 rebels and one palace guard were dead and Thalaya gave up. Abdullah was later reported executed, and Thalaya was publicly decapitated.|$|E

25|$|Caddy was {{inducted}} into the United States Marine Corps through the Selective Service system on October 27, 1943 and was put on inactive duty until November 10, 1943 when he was ordered to Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina, for recruit training. While attending recruit training Caddy received training on several weapons in use at the time including the Reising <b>sub-machine</b> <b>gun,</b> Browning automatic rifle, M-1 carbine, bayonet and the hand grenade.

25|$|At about 4:30pm on Friday 3 July, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and British {{soldiers}} from the Royal Scots regiment entered the Lower Falls {{to carry out a}} weapons search. An informer had told them they would find an arms dump belonging to the Official IRA in a house on Balkan Street. A column of five or six armoured vehicles arrived at the house and sealed off the street. The search lasted about 45 minutes and uncovered 15 pistols, a rifle, a <b>sub-machine</b> <b>gun</b> and a large quantity of ammunition.|$|E
25|$|Designed {{and built}} by the Nambu Arms Manufacturing Company under a low-priority {{military}} contract, the Type 100 was a submachine gun that was first delivered to the Imperial Army in 1942. Japan was surprisingly late to introduce the <b>sub-machine</b> <b>gun</b> to its armed forces — a few models of the SIG Bergmann 1920 (a licensed version of the German MP 18) were purchased from Switzerland in the 1920s. These were examined and copied, with significant changes. In 1942 the Type 100 SMG was first delivered for service, used by Japanese marines during the invasion of Southern China.|$|E

25|$|Israeli forces withdrew {{later in}} 1978, turning over {{positions}} inside Lebanon to their ally, the South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia {{under the leadership}} of Maj. Saad Haddad. On April 19, 1978, the SLA shelled UNIFIL headquarters, killing 8 UN soldiers. (Fisk, 138). In April 1980, three Irish UN soldiers (Privates Barrett, Smallhorne and O'Mahoney) were kidnapped and two of them murdered by Christian gunmen, Private O'Mahoney survived (being shot by <b>sub-machine</b> <b>gun</b> during the incident) in SLA territory and another Irish soldier Private S. Griffen was shot by Haddad's men, and was medevaced to Israel where he subsequently died during medical treatment. The Israeli press at the time, particularly the Jerusalem Post, accused the Irish of pro-PLO bias. (Fisk, 152–154).|$|E
25|$|The a {{wide variety}} of rifles found their way into the Inner Mongolian Army arsenal, mostly bought by Prince De Wang or given by the Japanese. The first weapons that they {{received}} were 10,000 Mauser Model 13 rifles from the Mukden factory, given as a gift by the Young Marshal Zhang Xueliang. Other small arms included the Swiss Sig. Model 1930 <b>sub-machine</b> <b>gun,</b> utilized by bodyguards in small numbers. Machine guns in use numbered about 200 with some of them being the Czech ZB-26 light machine gun. Those also came from Zhang Xueliang's former army after it was defeated by the Japanese. The Inner Mongolians had about 70 artillery pieces, mostly mortars but also a few field and mountain guns, from former Nationalist stores. Reportedly they did use a few armored cars and tanks, but they were most likely operated by Japanese.|$|E
50|$|For more firepower, detectives {{and special}} units are {{routinely}} armed with Type 77 and QSZ-92 semi-automatic pistols. <b>Sub-machine</b> <b>guns,</b> rifles and light machine guns are deployed when more firepower are required.|$|R

25|$|In 1985, 19 {{members of}} Los Macheteros were indicted for offenses {{associated}} with the Wells Fargo heist. Ojeda Ríos was captured {{as part of an}} FBI operation that took place following two years of surveillance on the group. In the operation a group of 24 agents protected by bulletproof vests, entered the building where Ojeda Ríos had his residence. The agents received assistance from a group of snipers located on adjacent buildings and a helicopter. When Ojeda noticed the presence of the agents he fired a <b>sub-machine</b> <b>gun</b> at them and threatened to kill anyone that tried to reach the building's second floor. In the meanwhile Ojeda's wife Blanca Iris Serrano burned documents in the apartment's bathroom. When the agents tried to climb the ladder to reach the building's second floor Filiberto opened fire against them wounding one of them. At that moment one of the snipers disarmed him with a bullet giving the other agents enough time to arrest him.|$|E
500|$|Tom Derrick {{was widely}} mourned. His widow, Beryl, became {{prostrate}} with grief on hearing of his death; {{many members of}} the Army were affected, with one soldier lamenting it felt as if [...] "the whole war stopped". By the time Derrick's death was officially announced on 30 May, most Australians on Tarakan had heard the news and rumours had spread claiming that he had been speared or shot at short range by a <b>sub-machine</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
500|$|Operation Nimrod {{brought the}} SAS, a {{regiment}} that was largely unknown {{at the time}} owing to the covert nature of its operations, into the public eye. The regiment was not pleased with its new high profile, having enjoyed its previous obscurity. Nonetheless, the operation vindicated the SAS, which had been threatened with disbandment and whose use of resources had previously been considered a waste. The regiment was quickly overwhelmed by new applicants. Membership of 22SAS is open only to individuals currently serving in the Armed Forces (allowing applications from any individual in any service), but the unit also has two regiments from the volunteer Territorial Army (TA): 21 SAS and 23 SAS. Both the TA regiments received hundreds more applications than in previous years, prompting de la Billière to remark that the applicants seemed [...] "convinced that a balaclava helmet and a Heckler & Koch <b>sub-machine</b> <b>gun</b> would be handed to them over the counter, {{so that they could}} go off and conduct embassy-style sieges of their own". All three units were forced to introduce additional fitness tests {{at the start of the}} application process. The SAS also experienced an increased demand for their expertise in training the forces of friendly countries and those whose collapse was considered not to be in Britain's interest.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sub-machine</b> <b>guns</b> {{are often}} deployed, notably the Heckler & Koch MP5 and the FN P90, and Heckler & Koch G36 rifles in normal, compact and short {{variants}} are also stocked in the GOE armory.|$|R

500|$|Released on June 25, 1999 for the PlayStation in Japan, Metal Gear Solid: Integral is an {{expanded}} {{edition of the}} game that features the added content from the American and European versions. It replaces the Japanese voices from the original version with the English dub, offering players a choice between Japanese and English subtitles during cutscenes and CODEC conversations (item descriptions, mission logs and other text are still in Japanese). Further additional content to the main game include an alternate [...] "sneaking suit" [...] outfit for Meryl (which she wears when Snake is dressed in the tuxedo), a [...] "Very Easy" [...] difficulty setting where the player starts the mission armed with a suppressor-equipped MP5 <b>sub-machine</b> <b>gun</b> with infinite ammo (substituting the FAMAS rifle in Snake's inventory), an eighth Codec frequency featuring written staff commentary (unvoiced and in Japanese only) on every area and boss encounter, hidden music tracks, an alternate game mode where the player controls Snake from a first-person perspective (on Normal difficulty only), an option for alternate patrol routes for enemies, and a downloadable PocketStation minigame. The Torture Event was also made easier on higher difficulty levels, {{reducing the number of}} rounds to three per session in all settings.|$|E

[...] In a fateful {{coincidence}} Bent sees Ketty arrive at the hotel in the company of Hoffman in {{what appears to be a}} tryst. [...] Later Bent confronts Ketty, and she argues that army intelligence requested her to stay close to Hoffmann. Bent demands to know what car Hoffman uses and what his route is. Later, on the road, Bent, Jørgen and some allies open fire on two cars with Nazi flags; however, they are dismayed to discover they have killed a father and wounded a child. An enraged Bent goes to Ketty's hotel room, only to discover that she has flown to Stockholm, fearing Hoffmann's retaliation. Now, Bent and Jørgen plan to kill Hoffmann, and they disguise themselves as policemen. However, they are arrested in a general round-up of the German-allied Danish police, who are killing policemen by firing squad. Jørgen decides to jump over a fence and is shot, allowing Bent to escape. Time passes, and Jørgen is at a safe house. A squad of German officers arrives. He kills some of them with a <b>sub-machine</b> <b>gun</b> and grenades but ultimately is killed. Meanwhile, Bent, in his home, commits suicide with a pill when he sees the Gestapo arriving. Later, Hoffmann gives Ketty the reward for helping apprehend Bent and a letter from him found in his room, in which he expresses his feelings and his doubt of her betrayal. The film ends with notes about Bent and Jørgen's legacy.|$|E
500|$|The Germans {{knew the}} {{invasion}} was imminent {{if not the}} exact location; Major Schmidt, {{in command of the}} bridges, had been told that they were {{one of the most critical}} points in Normandy. The defenders however were not on full alert and only two sentries were on duty when the gliders landed. The sound of a gunshot alerted the two sentries on the canal bridge. As Brotheridge's platoon attacked, one ran off shouting [...] "paratroops" [...] while the second fired a flare gun to alert nearby defenders. Brotheridge shot him while other members of his platoon cleared the trenches and pillbox with grenades. Alerted by the flare, the German machine gunners opened fire at the men on the bridge, wounding Brotheridge as he threw a grenade. The grenade silenced one of the machine gun positions and another was taken out by Bren gun fire. Number One Platoon crossed the bridge to take up a defensive position on the west bank. The Royal Engineers from number one glider searched for explosive charges and cut the fuse wires when they found any. Smith's platoon crossed the bridge next, exchanging fire with the German defenders, whereupon Smith was wounded by a grenade. Using grenades and <b>sub-machine</b> <b>gun</b> fire, the platoons cleared the trenches and bunkers. By 00:21 German resistance on the west bank of the canal bridge was over. Checking the area, the men of Brotheridge's platoon now realised that their leader was wounded. He failed to recover and soon died of his wounds, becoming the first Allied soldier killed by enemy action during the invasion. On the east bank, Wood's platoon cleared the trenches and bunkers with little opposition. Woods was hit in the leg by machine-gun fire as he ordered the platoon to storm the German defences. All three platoon commanders at the canal bridge were now either dead or wounded.|$|E
