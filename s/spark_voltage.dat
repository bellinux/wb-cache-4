50|$|The {{operating}} temperature of {{a spark plug}} is the actual physical temperature {{at the tip of}} the spark plug within the running engine, normally between 500 and 800 C. This is important because it determines the efficiency of plug self-cleaning and is determined by a number of factors, but primarily the actual temperature within the combustion chamber. There is no direct relationship between the actual {{operating temperature}} of the spark plug and <b>spark</b> <b>voltage.</b> However, the level of torque currently being produced by the engine will strongly influence spark plug operating temperature because the maximal temperature and pressure occur when the engine is operating near peak torque output (torque and rotational speed directly determine the power output). The temperature of the insulator responds to the thermal conditions it is exposed to in the combustion chamber, but not vice versa. If the tip of the spark plug is too hot, it can cause pre-ignition or sometimes detonation/knocking, and damage may occur. If it is too cold, electrically conductive deposits may form on the insulator, causing a loss of spark energy or the actual shorting-out of the spark current.|$|E

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that the electrostatic force of attraction between spheres, rather than the <b>sparking</b> <b>voltage,</b> be adopted as the standard method of measuring high voltage. This proposal {{is based on the}} following investigations and results: 1. The <b>sparking</b> <b>voltage</b> of 50 centimeter standard testing spheres varies considerably even when corrections are made for changing air density. At larger spacings, the gap is influenced by the unavoidable presence of ground planes. 2. Accurate force measurements made {{over a period of several}} months gave a mean <b>sparking</b> <b>voltage</b> curve which differs by a few per cent from a newly recommended A. I. E.

Computations have been made for the effect of the spheres' shanks and the laboratory floor and walls on the attractive force between spheres.

A spark gap was set up so that one electrode could be heated to temperatures up to 700 degrees C., while the other electrode and the air in the gap were maintained at room temperature. The <b>sparking</b> <b>voltages</b> were measured both with direct voltage and with voltage impulse from ignition coil.

These results indicate that the ignition spark will pass more readily when the spark-plug design is such as to make the electrodes run hot. This possible gain is, however, very closely limited by the danger of producing preignition. These experiments also show that sparking is somewhat easier when the hot electrode (which is almost always the central electrode) is negative than when the polarity is reversed...|$|R

2500|$|The primary coil's {{resonant}} frequency is tuned {{to that of}} the secondary, by using low-power oscillations, then increasing the power (and retuning if necessary) until the system operates properly at maximum power. While tuning, a small projection (called a [...] "breakout bump") is often added to the top terminal in order to stimulate corona and spark discharges (sometimes called streamers) into the surrounding air. Tuning can then be adjusted so as to achieve the longest streamers at a given power level, corresponding to a frequency match between the primary and secondary coil. Capacitive 'loading' by the streamers tends to lower the {{resonant frequency}} of a Tesla coil operating under full power. A toroidal topload is often preferred to other shapes, such as a sphere. A toroid with a major diameter that is much larger than the secondary diameter provides improved shaping of the electrical field at the topload. This provides better protection of the secondary winding (from damaging streamer strikes) than a sphere of similar diameter. And, a toroid permits fairly independent control of topload capacitance versus <b>spark</b> breakout <b>voltage.</b> A toroid's capacitance is mainly a function of its major diameter, while the <b>spark</b> breakout <b>voltage</b> is mainly a function of its minor diameter.|$|R
