40|$|Target firms often face a {{takeover}} threat from raiders with prior stakes in its ownership (toeholds). Previous literature has shown that, when takeovers are modeled as standard auctions, toeholds induce more aggressive bids from raiders, which has two important {{consequences for the}} selling process: (i) {{the board of directors}} is no longer indifferent about the <b>sale</b> <b>procedure</b> used to get the highest price, and (ii) the target may not be assigned to the highest- value raider. This paper characterizes how the price-maximizing procedure should be in the presence of asymmetric toeholds. Our central result is that the optimal rule needs to be implemented by a discriminatory mechanism quite different from conventional auction formats. By imposing an extra-charge against high-toehold bidders, the optimal mechanism is able to extract more surplus from raiders who bid more aggressively. As a result, nonbidding shareholders benefit unambiguously from the toehold asymmetry. Furthermore, as this bias restores the symmetry in bidders’ expected payoffs, the proposed mechanism also allows to allocate efficiently the target among them...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Two {{hundred and}} fifty-four nonindustrial private forest landowners in western Oregon were {{surveyed}} to develop baseline information about harvesting practices {{and to examine}} the influence of marketing procedures on delivered log prices. Most respondents harvested to meet income or silvicultural objectives. Harvests on ownerships less than 50 acres in size accounted for over {{one third of the}} harvest volume. The majority of harvests were partial cuts; salvage harvests comprised about 20 percent of the sales. Most respondents managed their own sales or relied on the logger or timber buyer. Consultants managed only six percent of the sales. Respondents who left the sale details to the logger were significantly less satisfied with the sale results and earned lower prices than other landowners. A regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between <b>sale</b> <b>procedures</b> and the delivered log price. The model indicated that sale to export buyers and the number of buyers contacted were positively associated with sale price; payment of the logger on a percentage basis, lack of familiarity with price levels and trends, and buyer-initiated sales were negatively associated with the sales price. Analysis of the relationships between ownership characteristics and <b>sale</b> <b>procedures</b> indicated that experienced landowners with larger holdings were better timber marketers by normative standards...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to define the {{importance}} of radio frequency identification (RFID) for major lumber retailers. This project will emphasize the cost savings and efficiencies that would be gained by transitioning out of the current bar coded method of tracking into more effective RFID technology. The focus will be to analyze the processes associated with selling lumber and wood-related products with emphasis on inventory visibility of product in retail stores and retail lumber yards. This document will show the realized losses by large lumber retailers from traditional bar coding systems versus their potential return on investment from RFID technology. Each necessary process to sell lumber in the retail environment, from receiving product {{to the point of}} <b>sale</b> <b>procedure,</b> will be scrutinized to show the optimal potential results with RFID. The results will be divided into three key areas of savings with RFID: the decrease in labour the higher inventory visibility within the retail location and the reduction in inventory shrinkage. Speculative examples will also be discussed to give better understanding of the retail processes and their prospective economic benefits. This project has been devised to help lumber retailers realize the potential of the technology and direct them to pull the demand of implementation from their suppliers and throughout their own supply chains.
