As described in detail below, DOE was directed to make the international dissemination of Clean Coal Technologies (CCTs) an integral part of its policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries. Congress directed DOE to solicit ``Statements of Interest`` in commercial projects employing CCTs in countries projected to have significant growth in greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, DOE was asked to submit to the Congress a report that analyzes the information contained in the <b>Statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interest,</b> and that identifies the extent to which various types of Federal incentives would accelerate the commercial availability of these technologies in an international context. In response to DOE`s solicitation of 18 November 1994, 77 <b>Statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interest</b> were received from 33 companies, as well as five additional materials. The contents of these submittals, including the requested Federal incentives, the CCTs proposed, the possible host countries, and the environmental aspects <b>of</b> the <b>Statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interest,</b> are described and analyzed in the chapters that follow...|$|R

5000|$|In 2011, Garcia {{was arrested}} by {{a police officer in}} Wheaton, Maryland.

Garcia was charged with disorderly conduct and the police report claimed that he [...] "threw himself to the ground, attempting to injure himself." [...] He was acquitted of the charge several months later. His White House press credentials were not renewed because of the outstanding charge, but were renewed after the acquittal. On December 7, 2012, Garcia reinstated a lawsuit against Montgomery County, Maryland, its chief of police and several officers of the Montgomery County Police Department seeking among other things, compensatory and punitive damages. On March 4, 2013 the Justice Department filed a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> with the district court hearing the lawsuit, asserting its position that citizens have a First Amendment right to peacefully photograph law enforcement officers in the exercise of their duties, and urging the court to rule against a motion to dismiss filed by the defendants.|$|E
5000|$|Both Terex and the CIA {{immediately}} {{denied any}} military relationship with Iraq, and in April 1992, Terex filed a $15 million libel suit against Hersh and Fuisz, claiming that Fuisz fabricated {{the story as}} retaliation against the company for declining {{to enter into a}} business deal. In March 1993, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interest</b> in the trial and invoked the state secrets privilege to bar Fuisz from testifying in his own defense. The gag order claimed that the information Fuisz possessed was vital to the [...] "nation's security or diplomatic relations", and could not be revealed [...] "no matter how compelling the need for, and relevance of, the information", while empowering the government to [...] "protect its interests in this case in the future" [...] (effectively gagging Fuisz permanently). In October 1994, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia upheld the Justice Department's claim of state secrets privilege and by 1996 the suit had been dismissed. In December 1995, The New York Times issued a retraction and apology for Hersh's 1992 article, claiming that [...] "neither The Times nor Mr. Hersh intended" [...] {{to give the impression that}} Terex was supplying Scud missile launchers to Iraq, blaming errors made in the editorial process and [...] "false information" [...] supplied by Fuisz. The retraction noted that a 16-month federal investigation had determined [...] "there is no credible evidence" [...] that Terex supplied military equipment to Iraq, affirming that [...] "The Times has no evidence that contradicts the task force's findings"; this conclusion was supported by a separate investigation by the British House of Commons in 1996. However, in December 2003, a 12,000 page dossier submitted by the Scottish newspaper Sunday Herald to the United Nations revealed that Terex, along with more than twenty other American firms, had in fact supplied Iraq with weapons technology during the 1990s; Scottish Labour MP Tam Dalyell called the document [...] "of huge significance" [...] in exposing [...] "the hypocrisy of Blair and Bush." ...|$|E
