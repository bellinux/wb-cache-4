25|$|The {{movement}} of the human body, and most other objects, needs time to accelerate and slow down. For this reason, animation looks more realistic if it has more drawings near {{the beginning and end}} of an action, emphasizing the extreme poses, and fewer in the middle. This principle goes for characters moving between two extreme poses, such as <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> standing up, but also for inanimate, moving objects, like the bouncing ball in the above illustration.|$|E
25|$|Academic {{dress is}} only worn on {{ceremonial}} occasions: the university anniversary or dies natalis, inaugural lectures, {{and the public}} defence of a doctoral thesis. On such occasions, the assembled professors line up as a cortège headed by the university beadle, who also wears an academic gown and carries the university’s mace. Male professors remove their beret when <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> put it on when standing up (e.g. to lecture or to address a doctoral candidate during the thesis defence). Female professors may keep the beret on at all times.|$|E

The cover art of the album, {{as well as other}} promotion shoots, show Minogue <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> kneeling. After completing the shoot, Emmett was asked by Minogue to shoot the sleeve for her single [...] "Cowboy Style", and his most recent work with Minogue was shooting her on Glamour magazine in July 2012. One of the shoot outtakes appeared on Minogue's photo albums including Kylie / Fashion and on her 1997 extended play Other Sides.|$|E

[...] Holliday described {{his relationship with}} Boras and his staff in that he [...] "enjoy(s) <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> talking to them. [...] Scott is as accessible as {{you want him to}} be. [...] I could call him right now. He's got a lot of clients and people say they don’t hear from Scott but he’ll give you as much or as little attention as you want." [...] Holliday further explained that due to the amenities the Boras Corporation provides, including a staff psychologist, research to assist players in prolonging careers, studies into arbitration cases, and statistical performance computation, he felt that Boras' agency gave him the best opportunities to succeed.|$|E
500|$|While {{the books}} {{could be said}} to {{comprise}} many other themes, such as power/abuse of power, violence and hatred, love, loss, prejudice, and free choice, they are, as Rowling states, [...] "deeply entrenched in the whole plot"; the writer prefers to let themes [...] "grow organically", rather than <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> consciously attempting to impart such ideas to her readers. Along the same lines is the ever-present theme of adolescence, in whose depiction Rowling has been purposeful in acknowledging her characters' sexualities and not leaving Harry, as she put it, [...] "stuck in a state of permanent pre-pubescence". Rowling has also been praised for her nuanced depiction {{of the ways in which}} death and violence affects youth, and humanity as a whole.|$|E
500|$|A lyrical {{music video}} was {{released}} to Platten's Vevo account on April 21, 2016. The official video {{was directed by}} Matthew Stawski and produced by Austin Barbera, Missy Galanida, and Isaac Rice. It opens with an annotation reading, [...] "For her 'Better Place' music video, Rachel wanted to conduct a social experiment with her fans". The singer is then shown walking around a couch before <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> turning on a nearby radio. After she departs the room, various couples and individuals are then welcomed into the room where they take a seat {{and listen to the}} song. All of the persons eventually grasps each other's hands or embrace. Towards the end of the song, Platten surprises the guests and greets them. Shortly after this, the screen fades to black.|$|E

500|$|The {{landscape}} in Eragon {{is based on}} the [...] "wild territory" [...] of Paolini's home state, Montana. He said in an interview: [...] "I go hiking a lot, and oftentimes when I'm in the forest or in the mountains, <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> seeing some of those little details makes the difference between having an okay description and having a unique description." [...] Paolini also said that Paradise Valley, Montana is [...] "one of the main sources" [...] of his inspiration for the {{landscape in}} the book (Eragon takes place in the fictional continent Alagaësia). Paolini [...] "roughed out" [...] the main history of the land before he wrote the book, but he did not draw a map of it until it became important to see where Eragon was traveling. He then started to get history and plot ideas from seeing the landscape depicted.|$|E
500|$|John Williams began {{composing}} {{the score}} in October 2007; ten days of recording sessions wrapped on March 6, 2008, at Sony Pictures Studios. Williams described composing for the Indiana Jones universe again as [...] "like <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> finishing {{a letter that}} you started 25 years ago". He reused Indiana's theme (Raiders March) and also Marion's from Raiders of the Lost Ark, and also composed five new motifs for Mutt, Spalko and the skull. Williams gave Mutt's a swashbuckling feel, and homaged film noir and 1950s B-movies for Spalko and the crystal skull respectively. As an in-joke, Williams incorporated a measure {{and a half of}} Johannes Brahms' [...] "Academic Festival Overture" [...] when Indiana and Mutt crash into the library. The soundtrack features a Continuum, an instrument often used for sound effects instead of music. The Concord Music Group released the soundtrack on May 20, 2008.|$|E
500|$|Papa {{was born}} on March 10, 1987 to Kwaku and Gertrude Oppong and {{was brought up in}} the Pickering, Ontario area. Both of his parents were natives of Ghana in West Africa, and Papa began playing soccer. He could not skate, meaning he {{struggled}} with ice hockey, Canada's most popular sport. Oppong said, [...] "Soccer is really popular in Africa, so my dad got me into soccer. Basketball is more of my love. I was <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> watching Michael Jordan and Kobe and all of those guys when I was younger, and I had more of a passion for it." [...] He learned the basics of basketball with the Ontario Basketball's Scarborough, Ontario club team. Oppong attended Blessed Mother Teresa Catholic Secondary School in Scarborough. He helped the team win the provincial Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations (OFSAA) championship. He was also named Ontario Mr. Basketball.|$|E

500|$|To {{promote the}} single, Chisuga {{appeared}} on several {{radio stations in}} Japan including Rajira Sunday and Hiroshi Kamiya's All Night radio show through Nippon Broadcasting System. She also held a live event to promote the single in Osaka, Japan, May 2015. Then throughout early-mid May 2016, Chisuga visited the Japanese music store Animate in cities Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto, Sannomiya, and Osaka, and signed autographs. She then followed up by visiting stores Namba Shop and Akiba Sofmap in Japan. On July 9, Chisuga will perform [...] "Ai no Uta (Words of Love)" [...] for the first time, {{in order to promote}} the single. An accompanying music video was directed by Nozomi Tanaka. It was shot in an aquarium, and included Chisuga <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> observing several fishes. Along with this, she was surrounded by several glow lights and spot lights. It was released on YouTube by Victor Entertainment, Chisuga's parent label, and premiered through Japanese music television on April 8, 2016.|$|E
500|$|The {{filming of}} the episode was, as expected, a long process. Prior to the episode, the cast {{underwent}} a full week of rehearsals, something never before done for a Scrubs episode. A group of eight core dancers were brought in for the dance numbers, while over fifty dancers {{were involved in the}} [...] "Welcome To Sacred Heart" [...] scene. There are some notable cameos in the episode, including episode composer Jeff Marx as a pharmacist in [...] "Gonna Miss You, Carla;" [...] occasional Scrubs musical contributor Keren DeBerg as an extra in [...] "Are You Okay?"; and Broadway actress Karen Ziemba (a friend of Mackenzie's) as the neurologist. Further complicating matters was the fact that Judy Reyes had recently fractured her pelvis, and so had to film all her scenes <b>sitting</b> <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> not dancing, aside from her number with Donald Faison ("For the Last Time, I'm Dominican"), which was filmed approximately 2 months after the rest {{of the episode}}. The bald cap D'Abruzzo wore during the end of the episode took four hours to put on, and she described it as very uncomfortable.|$|E
500|$|He {{took the}} new episode on as a challenge, {{in the belief}} that the {{producers}} didn't think the episode would work well, which caused him to become determined to put out a good episode. He had numerous discussions with Brent Spiner, Justman, and Rick Berman on aspects of the episode, and the technical requirements and effects required an additional day of filming. Bowman credited Spiner for making the episode work, giving one example, [...] "He did the one scene in his own office with Brent <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> Lore discussing what it's like to be human. He did one side, we shot through a double, then turned around, read it the other way and shot the other half of it. Those two characters in those scenes are different people... he really painted those characters differently." [...] Edits were still being made to the script during filming, as the writers wanted to introduce a new element to Data, in order to further distinguish him from Lore: an inability to use contractions. Data had used contractions during earlier episodes, and Spiner refused to shoot the scene until a final decision was reached; production stopped while there was a meeting on this subject between Gene Roddenberry, the producers, and the writers, {{in the middle of the}} bridge set.|$|E

500|$|Gaga {{performed}} the song live along with [...] "Venus" [...] on the tenth series of The X Factor (UK) on October 27, 2013, at Fountain Studio in Wembley. Jason Lipshutz from Billboard denoted it as [...] "intoxicatingly weird". ITV, which aired the performance, and Ofcom, the British media regulator, received around 260 complaints regarding the performance, due to Gaga's costume and the suggestive lyrics of the track, which was broadcast before the 9pm watershed. A spokesperson from the channel {{released a statement}} {{that they did not}} believe the performance to be inappropriate. During her ArtRave party for the release of Artpop, Gaga performed eight songs from the album, closing the set with [...] "Do What U Want". The performance ended with the singer mirroring the pose of the album cover art—a Jeff Koons sculpture—on the stage, by <b>sitting</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> spreading her legs apart, while cupping her breasts. On November 16, 2013, Gaga performed [...] "Do What U Want" [...] at episode 751 of the 39th season of comedy show Saturday Night Live. Kelly appeared as the guest vocalist, doing the similar routine with Gaga, and picking her up from the stage on his shoulder. There was also sex simulations, dry humping and they ended the performance in an embrace. According to Zach Johnson from E!, the performance drew mixed reaction from the media.|$|E
