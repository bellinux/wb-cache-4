5000|$|In January 2015, {{while on}} break from touring, Evan Weiss and current touring drummer Josh Sparks {{lived in a}} secluded cabin in Craftsbury, Vermont for one month to write the third Into It Over It album. Built for the {{specific}} purpose of allowing musicians to work in isolation, Weiss said of the location: [...] "we were an hour from the nearest gas station, an hour from the nearest grocery store. Totally isolated, four feet {{of snow on the}} ground, negative 20 degrees outside. The whole thing was run on solar or generator power, so no phone, no Internet." [...] He and Sparks spent 13 hours a day writing music. After completing a solo tour alongside Kevin Devine and Laura Stevenson, a stint in the UK with Modern Baseball and several <b>Spring</b> <b>support</b> dates for Minus the Bear, Weiss officially wrapped up touring for the Intersections album—which by that time had consisted of [...] "well over 250 shows in a little over 15 countries" [...] since 2013—to begin recording Into It Over It's third studio album with John Vanderslice. Weiss and Sparks entered Vanderslice's Tiny Telephone Studio in June to record the album entirely to tape; Weiss recalled that [...] "we couldn't sweat the small stuff, you're not able to go in and tweak or micromanage little sections of the music. It helped me accept chaos in a way I couldn't before." [...] Into It Over It continued to play shows into the end of 2015 after Weiss completed a tour with his side project Pet Symmetry in support of Dan Andriano in the Emergency Room and Jeff Rosenstock. Notable dates included Riot Fest Chicago, Weiss' solo set at The Fest, a tour in support of The Get Up Kids in December (with Weiss and Into It Over It touring member Rodrigo Palma playing bass for The Get Up Kids at one show), and The Promise Ring's New Year's Eve reunion show.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{quenching}} problem of electromagnetic vibration of the inverter motor stator. The iron stator of the inverter motor is modeled by a perfect circular ring. Single or two spring supports are set on the circular ring to quench the forced vibration caused by the rotating distributed electromagnetic force. Moreover, single or two Houde dampers are installed {{on the outside of}} the circular ring. The solutions of forced vibration are obtained by the theoretical analysis. The following were made clear; (1) By setting single or two spring supports with 10 percent spring constant of the mode to be quenched on the stator, the resonant amplitude of the stator decreases to one half. When two spring supports are used, the best setting positions are those that make the angle between loops of the mode to be quenched. (2) By setting not only single <b>spring</b> <b>support</b> on the stator but also setting two Houde dampers in the suitable positions, those exist several ones depending on the position of <b>spring</b> <b>support,</b> the vibration of motor stator is quenched over wide frequency region around resonance.

40|$|Because the {{flexible}} multispan shaft in large machines often rotates at supercritical speed, {{it is desirable}} {{to find ways to}} suppress the resulting bending vibration. In this paper, a novel type of support structure is proposed and investigated, which can suppress the bending vibration using dry friction. This approach is called Smart <b>Spring</b> <b>support</b> (SMSS). A dynamic model for the multispan shaft with SMSS is developed. The relationship between the vibration suppression effect and the control parameters of the SMSS is obtained through a numerical example involving a helicopter tail drive shaft. A structure of the SMSS is designed and examined with a rotor test. The results demonstrate that the SMSS has a significant effect on bending vibration suppression of flexible multispan shafts. The vibration-reduction ratio of the peak amplitude reaches 57. 2 % in the numerical example and 45. 2 % in the rotor test...|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for detection {{of the location}} of simple translational spring supports in elastic structures by non-destructive and non-intrusive means, based on measured natural frequencies of the structure. A gradient-based finite element (FE) model updating technique {{has been used for}} such detection. Measured modal data along with an initially correlated FE model are used. The present study is a new application of an existing FE model updating technique. The proposed method involves the detection of <b>spring</b> <b>support</b> locations by updating the position parameters of the support in the FE model through the optimization of an error criterion based on the difference between measured and computed natural frequencies of the structural system. The location of the support appears explicitly as an updating parameter in the formulation of the problem.

The results and various limitations observed while developing the current method have been presented through numerical examples and a simple experimental example...|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Resonance-type microscopies {{have been}} widely used to {{evaluate}} the nanoscaled or microscaled surface elastic properties of materials by the resonance-frequency shifts of an oscillator, which contacts the surface of materials by a spherical tip. Approach: The tip-specimen contact is modeled to be a <b>spring</b> <b>support,</b> whose stiffness is given by the traditional Hertzian contact theory. However, because of the influence of the oscillator vibration and the anisotropy in nanoscaled or microscaled region of materials, the predicted results from the traditional Hertzian contact theory can not coincide with the experimental observations. In order to explain this discrepancy, dynamic contact stiffness at the contact interface between a rigid sphere and a semi-infinite cubic solid is investigated. Results: An oscillating force being superposed on a biasing force excites the oscillation of the sphere contacting with the solid surface, which causes the contact radius to vary with the oscillation. The assumption of sufficiently small oscillating force compared with the biasing force yields an oscillating-contact-pressure distribution of the constant contact radius and then dynamic contact stiffness. Because the oscillating-contact-pressure distribution cannot promise the uniform contact deformation, the influence of contact-displacement conditions is discussed. Conclusion: It is shown that dynamic contact stiffness depends on the oscillating frequency and contact radius of the sphere and the solid anisotropy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCharacterization Of High-Stroke High-Aspect Ratio Micro Electro Mechanical Systems Deformable Mirrors For Adaptive OpticsMohamed Amine BouchtiAdaptive optics MEMS {{deformable}} mirror, {{in conjunction}} with Shack Hartman wave front sensor and real-time controller, is capable of correcting time-varying aberrations in imaging applications through manipulating its mirror surface. Adaptive optics systems in astronomy for next generation large telescopes (30 meter primary mirrors) require a high stroke of 10 &# 956;m of mechanical displacement. This required stroke would be achieved by MEMS deformable mirrors fabricated with high aspect ratio techniques. This thesis will review the designs of various types of high aspect actuators consisting of folded springs with rectangular and circular membranes as well as X-beam actuators. Finite element analysis (FEA) simulations of these designs have shown the ability of each design to achieve a stroke of approximately 9. 4 µm. Also, FEA simulations proved that the X-beam actuators provide the best <b>spring</b> <b>support</b> while preventing tilting. In addition, this thesis will discuss device characterization and voltage vs. displacement test results for the high aspect ratio gold MEMS 16 x 16 X-beam actuators deformable mirror that has been bonded and packaged.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the long term {{behaviour}} of periodically excited mechanical systems consisting of linear components and local nonlinearities. The particular system investigated is a 2 D pinned-pinned beam, which halfway its length {{is supported by a}} one-sided spring and excited by a periodic transversal force. The linear part of this system is modelled by means of the finite element method and subsequently reduced using a Component Mode Synthesis method. Periodic solutions are computed by solving a two-point boundary value problem using finite differences or, alternatively, by using the shooting method. Branches of periodic solutions are followed at a changing design variable by applying a path following technique. Floquet multipliers are calculated to determine the local stability of these solutions and to identify local bifurcation points. Also stable and unstable manifolds are calculated. The long term behaviour is also investigated by means of standard numerical time integration, in particular for determining chaotic motions. In addition, the Cell Mapping technique is applied to identify periodic and chaotic solutions and their basins of attraction. An extension of the existing cell mapping methods enables to investigate systems with many degrees of freedom. By means of the above methods very rich complex dynamic behaviour is demonstrated for the beam system with one-sided <b>spring</b> <b>support.</b> This behaviour is confirmed by experimental results.
