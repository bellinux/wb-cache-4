In 1995 the transmitter went out of service with a loud bang literary. After loss of power, a phase dropped, the cooling for the <b>tube</b> and <b>tube</b> <b>socket</b> ceased. The <b>tube</b> <b>socket</b> melt down into the power supply and then the transmitter was beyond repair.|$|R

50|$|Amphenol {{was founded}} in Chicago in 1932 by {{entrepreneur}} Arthur J. Schmitt, whose first product was a <b>tube</b> <b>socket</b> for radio <b>tubes</b> (valveholder bases). Amphenol expanded significantly during World War II, when the company became the primary manufacturer of connectors used in military hardware, including airplanes and radios. From 1967 to 1982 {{it was part of}} Bunker Ramo Corporation.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to BS546, British Standards for {{domestic}} {{plugs and sockets}} included dimensional specifications for the <b>socket</b> contact <b>tubes.</b> [...] In BS546 there are no dimensions for socket contacts, instead {{they are required to}} make good contact with the specified plug pins.|$|R
5000|$|Special [...] "octal" [...] {{connectors}} {{with either}} 8 or 11 pins, {{almost identical to}} octal relay <b>sockets</b> or <b>tube</b> <b>sockets,</b> were used to connect power supplies to some tube audio amplifiers, transmitters and tranceivers (especially in amateur radio models). Female sockets were installed on the power supply and male sockets (with exposed pins) on the radio equipment. Cable assemblies with mating connectors were also readily available. These connections transferred anode positive voltage (typically 600 VDC for Heathkit, 800 VDC for Collins), grid negative bias (-130 VDC), 6.3 and 12.6 VAC for heaters (filaments), and control functions (remote mains switching).|$|R
50|$|<b>Tube</b> <b>sockets</b> were {{typically}} mounted in holes {{on a sheet}} metal chassis and wires or other components were hand soldered to lugs {{on the underside of}} the socket. In the 1950s, printed circuit boards were introduced and <b>tube</b> <b>sockets</b> were developed whose contacts could be soldered directly to the printed wiring tracks. Looking at the bottom of a socket, or, equivalently, a tube from its bottom, the pins were numbered clockwise, starting at an index notch or gap, a convention that has persisted into the integrated circuit era.|$|R
50|$|In {{vacuum tube}} technology, a top cap is a {{terminal}} {{at the top}} of the tube envelope that connects one of the electrodes, the other electrodes being connected via the <b>tube</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Unlike [...] "vintage" [...] Fender tube amplifiers, the Hot Rod Deluxe uses a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) {{construction}} {{rather than}} Point-to-Point (PTP) construction. Internally, {{there are two}} sets of circuit boards. The main circuit board contains {{the majority of the}} electronic elements and provides the base onto which the potentiometers for the various controls, and the input and output jacks, are mounted. A secondary board provides the base onto which the <b>tube</b> <b>sockets</b> are mounted (although the pair of power <b>tube</b> <b>sockets</b> are mounted directly on the chassis with long leads connecting those to the secondary board).|$|R
50|$|A {{vacuum tube}} {{consists}} {{of two or more}} electrodes in a vacuum inside an airtight enclosure. Most tubes have glass envelopes, though ceramic and metal envelopes (atop insulating bases) have been used. The electrodes are attached to leads which pass through the envelope via an airtight seal. Most vacuum tubes have a limited lifetime, due to the filament or heater burning out or other failure modes, so they are made as replaceable units; the electrode leads connect to pins on the tube's base which plug into a <b>tube</b> <b>socket.</b> <b>Tubes</b> were a frequent cause of failure in electronic equipment, and consumers were expected to be able to replace tubes themselves. In addition to the base terminals, some tubes had an electrode terminating at a top cap. The principal reason for doing this was to avoid leakage resistance through the tube base, particularly for the high impedance grid input. The bases were commonly made with phenolic insulation which performs poorly as an insulator in humid conditions. Other reasons for using a top cap include improving stability by reducing grid-to-anode capacitance, improved high-frequency performance, keeping a very high plate voltage away from lower voltages, and accommodating one more electrode than allowed by the base. There was even an occasional design that had two top cap connections.|$|R
50|$|Early {{semiconductor}} devices were often inserted in <b>sockets,</b> like vacuum <b>tubes.</b> As devices improved, eventually sockets proved unnecessary for reliability, and devices were directly soldered to printed circuit boards. The package must handle the high temperature gradients of soldering without putting {{stress on the}} semiconductor die or its leads.|$|R
50|$|Matching plugs {{were also}} {{manufactured}} that let <b>tube</b> <b>sockets</b> {{be used as}} eight-pin electrical connectors; penurious experimenters would sometimes salvage the base from a discarded tube for this purpose. Octal sockets were used to mount other components, particularly electrolytic capacitor assemblies and electrical relays; octal-mount relays are still common.|$|R
50|$|TO-3 {{packages}} {{usually have}} two leads, the case being the third connection, though devices with more leads are used. The TO-3 case has two mounting holes. The design originated at Motorola around 1955. The lead spacing was {{originally intended to}} allow plugging the device into a then-common <b>tube</b> <b>socket.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{vacuum tube}} {{consists}} {{of two or more}} electrodes in a vacuum inside an airtight enclosure.

25|$|The {{internal}} {{elements of}} tubes {{have always been}} connected to external circuitry via pins at their base which plug into a <b>socket.</b> Subminiature <b>tubes</b> were produced using wire leads rather than sockets, however these were restricted to rather specialized applications. In addition to the connections {{at the base of}} the tube, many early triodes connected the grid using a metal cap at the top of the tube; this reduces stray capacitance between the grid and the plate leads. Tube caps were also used for the plate (anode) connection, particularly in transmitting tubes and tubes using a very high plate voltage.|$|R

2500|$|To {{further reduce}} the cost and {{complexity}} of radio equipment, two separate structures (triode and pentode for instance) could be combined in the bulb of a single multisection tube. An early example was the Loewe 3NF. This 1920s device had three triodes in a single glass envelope together with all the fixed capacitors and resistors required to make a complete radio receiver. As the Loewe set had only one <b>tube</b> <b>socket,</b> {{it was able to}} substantially undercut the competition since, in Germany, state tax was levied by the number of sockets. However, reliability was compromised, and production costs for the tube were much greater. In a sense, these were akin to integrated circuits. In the US, Cleartron briefly produced the [...] "Multivalve" [...] triple triode for use in the Emerson Baby Grand receiver. This Emerson set also had a single <b>tube</b> <b>socket,</b> but because it used a four-pin base, the additional element connections were made on a [...] "mezzanine" [...] platform {{at the top of the}} tube base.|$|R
50|$|The {{general-purpose}} {{nature of}} the Tube connector in principle allowed it {{to be used for}} any type of high-speed peripheral, although Acorn only used it for Tube coprocessors. The BBC Micro/Master range provided 5 address lines for the address range &60-&7F but the Tube protocol only used the lowest 3 bits. Only these 3 address lines are connected to internal <b>Tube</b> <b>sockets,</b> as found in the BBC Master or Universal Second Processor Unit.|$|R
50|$|At that time, {{tubes in}} {{consumer}} devices were installed in sockets and easily replaceable, {{except for the}} CRT in televisions. Most devices had a removable back with a diagram showing where to replace each tube. There {{were only a few}} types of <b>tube</b> <b>socket,</b> so it was easy to make a mistake. If testing showed all tubes to be working, the next step was a repair shop. As transistor devices became common, the grocery tube-tester vanished.|$|R
50|$|Arthur J. Schmitt (14 June 1893 - 29 March 1971) was an American engineer, inventor, {{entrepreneur}} and philanthropist. In 1932, {{he founded}} American Phenolic Corp (which became Amphenol) {{when he discovered}} that insulating plastic could effectively be used to produce <b>tube</b> <b>sockets</b> in a quicker and simpler method than using Bakelite or ceramic. Under his leadership, Amphenol developed and manufactured equipment for radios, military equipment during World War II, and various industrial uses after the war.|$|R
25|$|A {{catastrophic failure}} is one which {{suddenly}} makes the vacuum tube unusable. A {{crack in the}} glass envelope will allow air into the tube and destroy it. Cracks may result from stress in the glass, bent pins or impacts; <b>tube</b> <b>sockets</b> must allow for thermal expansion, to prevent stress in the glass at the pins. Stress may accumulate if a metal shield or other object presses on the tube envelope and causes differential heating of the glass. Glass may also be damaged by high-voltage arcing.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the vast}} {{majority}} of high-end, “boutique”-style guitar amplifiers, THD amplifiers are hand-built, but not hand-wired “point-to-point”. Instead, they utilize printed circuit boards (PCBs). There is some controversy in the guitar amplifier community about using PCBs as opposed to point-to-point wiring in tube amplifiers. THD escaped much of this criticism by using thick boards with large ground planes to reduce noise, as well as through-plating and use of Teflon wire for durability. THD also does not mount their electro-mechanical components like jacks, potentiometers, switches and <b>tube</b> <b>sockets</b> to the board.|$|R
50|$|A {{panel nut}} is very thin nut with a {{relatively}} large hole commonly used to mount threaded electrical switches.These are often used where light duty precision fasteners are needed.

They are of two types hexagonal panel nut and knurled round panel nut.Applications : Panel nuts are used in potentiometer control, light weight lock nut, switch hardware.Material :Brass, stainless steel, aluminium are the materials commonly used for this nut. Panel Nut Wrench: It is a double ended <b>tube</b> <b>socket</b> type tool for removing nuts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tube</b> <b>sockets</b> are {{electrical}} sockets into which vacuum tubes (also known as valves) can be plugged, holding {{them in place}} and providing terminals, which can be soldered into the circuit, {{for each of the}} pins. Sockets are designed to allow tubes to be plugged in in only one orientation. They were used in all tube electronic equipment to allow tubes, which failed relatively frequently, to be quickly tested and replaced. In the day of tube radio and television it was common in the US for local drug stores to have vacuum tube testers, and sell replacement tubes.|$|R
5000|$|The chassis was {{constructed}} first, from sheet metal or wood. Insulated terminal strips were then [...] riveted, nailed or screwed to the underside or {{interior of the}} chassis. Transformers, large capacitors, <b>tube</b> <b>sockets</b> and other large components were mounted {{to the top of}} the chassis. Their wires were led through holes to the underside or interior. The ends of lengths of wire or wire-ended components such as capacitors and resistors were pushed through the terminals, and usually looped and twisted. When all wires to be connected had been fitted to the terminal, they were soldered together (and to the terminal).|$|R
50|$|In 1935, RCA {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} tube base for their new metal envelope tubes, which they called an octal base. As the name implies it had eight pins - more than were usually used previously. Octal bases, as defined in IEC 60067, diagram IEC 67-I-5a, have a 45-degree angle between pins, which form a 17.45 mm diameter circle around a 7.82 mm diameter keyed post (sometimes called a spigot) in the center. Octal sockets were designed to accept octal tubes, the rib in the keyed post fitting an indexing slot in the <b>socket</b> so the <b>tube</b> could only be inserted in one orientation.|$|R

40|$|This project {{demonstrates}} {{the viability of}} vacuum tube replacements made from solid state technology and programmable logic. A collection of operational amplifiers, digital converters and a {{field programmable gate array}} (FPGA) achieve this goal. The project emulates a 12 AX 7 vacuum tube triode as it would operate in a Fender Champ guitar amplifier. While the prototype works specifically with the Fender Champ, minor modifications could provide the versatility for operation in different amplifiers, including high end vintage hi-fi equipment. The addition of a micro controller into these amplifiers allows for the use of digital filtering and effects while not requiring modifications that could effect the value of rare equipment.

2500|$|After {{the success}} of the {{oscilloscope}} kit, Heath went on to produce dozens of Heathkit products. Heathkits were influential in shaping two generations of electronic hobbyists. The Heathkit sales premise was that by investing the time to assemble a Heathkit, the purchaser could build something comparable to a factory-built product at a very significantly lower cash cost and, if it malfunctioned, could repair it himself. [...] During those decades, the premise was basically valid. Commercial factory-built electronic products were constructed from generic, discrete components such as vacuum <b>tubes,</b> <b>tube</b> <b>sockets,</b> capacitors, inductors and resistors, and essentially hand-wired and assembled. The home kit-builder could perform these assembly tasks himself, and, if careful, to at least the same standard of quality. In the case of their most expensive product, the Thomas electronic organ, building the Heathkit version represented very substantial savings.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Until now, {{numerous}} small hafts, {{only rarely}} fitted to an artefact, made from hard animal material, {{have been found}} outside the Midi area of France, mainly from the Marne and Jura regions and Switzerland. They are generally made of antler, sometimes bone, and have fairly variable shapes and sizes. They may be simple or double <b>sockets</b> or complete <b>tubes</b> with a cylindrical perforation as in the Barres case. Tubes from the Provence and Languedoc regions are relatively rare, always made from bone and have a more homogeneous design than those previously described.

40|$|The {{final stage}} {{amplifier}} stability {{has proved to}} be an important issue in the commissioning of CRM cyclotron at CIAE. An air cooled 4 CX 15, 000 tube final amplifier was designed to evaluate the anode circuit and neutralization, both of which are weak points of the CRM cyclotron amplifier. Instead of strip line, the new designed anode structure adopts coaxial form, resulting less chance of parasitic resonance in the circuits. A tuneable neutralization circuits was also included in the design, giving an opportunity to fine tune in high power operations. First, the instability in CRM RF system will be analyzed in this paper, followed with the new amplifier designs including the tube operating line calculations, input/output circuits designs and finite integral simulations.

50|$|As with loctal tubes, {{the pins}} of {{miniature}} tube are stiff wires protruding through {{the bottom of}} the glass envelope which plug directly into the socket. However, unlike all their predecessors, miniature tubes are not fitted with separate bases; the base {{is an integral part of}} the glass envelope. The pinched-off air evacuation nub is at the top of the tube, giving it its distinctive appearance. More than one functional section can be included in a single envelope; a dual triode configuration is particularly common. Seven- and nine-pin tubes were common, though miniature tubes with more pins, such as the Compactron series, were later introduced, and could fit up to three amplifying elements. Some miniature <b>tube</b> <b>sockets</b> had a skirt that mated with a cylindrical metal electrostatic shield that surrounded the tube, fitted with a spring to hold the tube in place if the equipment was subject to vibration. Sometimes the shield was also fitted with thermal contacts to transfer heat from the glass envelope to the shield and act as a heat sink, which was considered to improve tube life in higher power applications.|$|R
