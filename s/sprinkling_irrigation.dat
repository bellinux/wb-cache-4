However, few studies have been related to the effects of water application intensity on movement of water and salt transport under <b>sprinkle</b> <b>irrigation</b> in this region. A soil-column experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of water application intensity on the movement of wetting front, water redistribution characteristics and salt leaching of coastal highly-saline soil. The experiments included two kinds of coastal highly-saline soils (clayey and sandy) and five water application intensity treatments, in which the <b>sprinkle</b> <b>irrigation</b> was controlled at 1. 72, 3. 13, 5. 27, 8. 75 and 10. 11 mm/h, respectively. The results showed that under <b>sprinkle</b> <b>irrigation,</b> the water application intensity and soil clay content significantly influenced the movement of the soil-wetting front. With the increase of water application intensity, the driving velocity of the wetting front increased, while the moist depth decreased. To some extent, the soil clay content had a negative effect on the movement of the wetting front. With the redistribution of the soil moisture, the volumetric moisture content of the same depth was largest at the water application intensity of 3. 13 mm/h in clayey highly-saline soil, while in sandy highly-saline soil, the most optimal water preserving capability was observed at the water application intensity of 1. 72 mm/h. After sprinkler irrigation, the salts in the upper soil layer were well leached, and moved down to the subsoil, where the soil salt content increased sharply to reach maximum. The suitable water application intensity of sprinkler irrigation was different on these two kinds of soils. Among the five treatments, the best leaching effect was obtained at the water application intensity of 3. 13 mm/h in clayey highly-saline soil, and 8. 75 mm/h in sandy highly-saline soil.

There were no significant interactions for dry matter yield. The non-significant interactions for dry matter yield. The non-significant results were probably due to the variability of the alfalfa stand among the specific areas harvested for each treatment and insufficient replications to control the variability. Forty-eight lambs were fed for 56 days on the twelve experimental hays with four lambs (replications) per treatment. The 56 day feeding period was split into four 14 -day pen-type feeding periods.

There was no significant response of the lamb to alfalfa hay quality (feed intake, weight gain or feed efficiency). Lambs increased feed intake when fed individually compared to pair feeding. The result was increased weight gain and feed efficiency of individually fed lambs. This was particularly evident during period two.

These results show that sheep will utilize rain leached hay efficiently if it is not heat damaged. The complication of heat damage needs additional study...|$|E
40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} experiments with undisturbed soil columns were performed {{for assessing the}} mobility and persistence of chloridazon and lenacil in a clayey soil in the marshes of Lebrija, southwest Spain. In the laboratory we tried to evaluate the herbicides fate when applied with doses greater than normal, as it happens by overlap when spraying the herbicides. Thus, the herbicides doses in the field experiments {{were similar to those}} applied by the growers in the area, while the doses applied to the soil columns were four times greater. Apart from that, in the field experiments the herbicides were incorporated into the soil just after the application, by <b>sprinkling</b> <b>irrigation,</b> as it is usually made by the growers. Sometimes, however, there is a delay in irrigating after herbicide application, which may favour adsorption by the soil. To evaluate how this can influence the fate of the studied herbicides in the soil, in the soil columns water was applied for the first time one week after applying the herbicides. Both herbicides showed a low mobility, being the amounts of residues found in the top 0. 05 m of soil several times greater than deeper in the soil. Negligible amounts of chloridazon were found at about 4 weeks after application, both in the field and in the soil columns. Lenacil showed a greater persistence, taking about 7 weeks after application for the herbicide to dissipate. The half-life values calculated from the field samples were 11 d for chloridazon and 16 d for lenacil. Calculations from the data of the soil column samples yielded half-life values of 4 d for chloridazon and 14 d for lenacil. The air temperature recorded in the laboratory during the experiments (18 ± 2 oC) was greater than in the field (average maximim temperature = 17. 2 oC; average minimum temperature = 8. 7 oC; minimum temperature = 1. 5 oC), which may explain the quicker dissipation of the herbicides in the soil columns. Also the higher herbicide concentration in column experiments could to have enhanced biodegradation process. For the studied conditions, neither chloridazon nor lenacil represent a serious risk of groundwater contamination. The values of the coefficient of variation of the herbicide residues in soil samples from the columns were similar to those from the field, suggesting that the technique for herbicide application in the soil columns should be improved to decrease variability.

40|$|The over {{exploitation}} {{represents the}} main problem of sustainable development of the groundwater aquifer in the study area, large drop in groundwater heads was recorded, it reached from 70 to 80  m, the main trend of water flow was also disturbed and many depleted closed areas were appeared. Groundwater quality shows relatively high salinity contents of some groundwater samples and abnormal concentration of iron element which was ranging from 2 to 10  mg/l produces rust-colored deposits and a brown slime that builds up on well screens, pipes, and plumbing fixtures. The dominant water type is sodium bicarbonate followed by sodium sulfate and sodium chloride. For proper development and optimal utilization of such non-renewable resources, daily groundwater exploitation should be decreased; the minimum spacing between wells should not be less than 2  km and total depth of wells should be between 600 and 700  m. Moreover, the present flood irrigation system should be replaced by more developed drip, <b>sprinkle</b> <b>irrigation</b> methods and less water consume crops should be recommended...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the effects of crop residue covers (0. 0; 4. 5; 9. 0; 13. 5 t ha- 1 millet dry matter) on water use and production of onion cultivated in no-tillage planting system (NT) as compared to conventional tillage system (CT). The study was carried out at Embrapa Hortaliças, Brazil, under the typical Savanna biome. Irrigations were performed using a <b>sprinkle</b> <b>irrigation</b> system when soil-water tension reached between 25 and 30 kPa. The experimental design was randomized blocks with three replications. Total net water depth applied to NT treatment was 19 % smaller than the CT treatment, however, water savings increased to 30 % for the first 30 days following seedlings transplant. Crop biomass, bulb size and yield, and rate of rotten bulbs were not significantly affected by treatments. The water productivity index increased linearly with increasing crop residue in NT conditions. Water productivity index of NT treatments with crop residue was on average 30 % higher than that in the CT system (8. 13 kg m- 3) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} Model of Irrigation Management {{was designed}} for application on green spaces and leisure areas. The Model recognizes water as a production key-factor and optimizes its use on the irrigation of green spaces, giving {{particular attention to the}} temporal and spatial variation of input variables. Variables entered in the Model included existing or future target plant species, phenological phases, type of soil (i. e. location and physical characteristics), topography and climate factors. Model construction was similar to the methods outlined in FAO Report 56, namely: the method of Penman-Monteith for the calculation of reference evapotranspiration, the use of dual cultural coefficients to obtain cultural evapotranspirationand the opportunity of irrigation according to the hydric balance. The Model integrates the programming of algorithms implemented in Visual Basic 6, VB 6 and a Geographic Information System (GIS). The Model provides the irrigation parameters in real-time scale, the timings for irrigation, depth per irrigation, the period of irrigation, time between two irrigation episodes, and for the <b>sprinkle</b> <b>irrigation,</b> the mean application rate and the degree of pulverization. The Model is used in association with an automatic weather station and irrigation system...|$|R
