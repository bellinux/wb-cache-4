5|$|In {{terms of}} {{keywords}} and language <b>syntax,</b> PHP {{is similar to}} the C style <b>syntax.</b> if conditions, for and while loops, and function returns are similar in <b>syntax</b> to languages such as C, C++, C#, Java and Perl.|$|E
5|$|At compile time, the {{interpreter}} parses Perl code into a <b>syntax</b> tree. At run time, it executes {{the program by}} walking the tree. Text is parsed only once, and the <b>syntax</b> tree is subject to optimization before it is executed, so that execution is relatively efficient. Compile-time optimizations on the <b>syntax</b> tree include constant folding and context propagation, but peephole optimization is also performed.|$|E
5|$|Blacklock {{then went}} to Doncaster, where on 23 September, he started 1/2 {{favourite}} and beat The Duchess to win the Doncaster Stakes over four miles. The same day he also walked over for a sweepstakes of 50 guineas each over the St. Leger course. Twenty-four hours later he beat Rasping to win a sweepstakes of 25 guineas each over four miles., {{and then went on}} to beat The Duchess to win the Doncaster Club Stakes. This was his fourth race in the space of two days. At Richmond in October he won his second Dundas Stakes, this time beating King Corney. Later in the day Blacklock finished last of four runners behind winner Doctor <b>Syntax</b> in the Richmond Cup over four miles. Doctor <b>Syntax</b> had started in the lead, but was overtaken by Blacklock after only 200 yards. Blacklock held the lead until about half a mile from the finish, when Doctor <b>Syntax</b> joined him again. Blacklock then swerved out of line, allowing Doctor <b>Syntax</b> to win easily. By the time The Richmond Cup was run Blacklock was apparently unwell and was coughing repeatedly during the race.|$|E

5|$|A classic {{error is}} {{the attempt to}} use the equals {{operator}} = {{in combination with the}} keyword NULL to find rows with Nulls. According to the SQL standard this is an invalid <b>syntax</b> and shall lead to an error message or an exception. But most implementations accept the <b>syntax</b> and evaluate such expressions to UNKNOWN. The consequence is that no rows are found - regardless of whether rows with Nulls exist or not. The proposed way to retrieve rows with Nulls is the use of the predicate IS NULL instead of = NULL.|$|E
5|$|Achebe's novels laid a {{formidable}} groundwork for this process. By altering <b>syntax,</b> usage, and idiom, he transforms the language into a distinctly African style.

5|$|Basic SQL {{comparison}} operators always return Unknown {{when comparing}} anything with Null, so the SQL standard provides for two special Null-specific comparison predicates. The IS NULL and IS NOT NULL predicates (which use a postfix <b>syntax)</b> test whether data is, or is not, Null.|$|E
5|$|COBOL <b>syntax</b> {{has often}} been criticized for its verbosity. Proponents {{say that this was}} {{intended}} to make the code self-documenting, easing program maintenance.

5|$|COBOL's <b>syntax</b> {{is usually}} {{described}} {{with a unique}} metalanguage using braces, brackets, bars and underlining. The metalanguage was developed for the original COBOL specifications. Although Backus–Naur form did exist at the time, the committee had not heard of it.|$|E

5|$|Many logical flaws {{were found}} in COBOL 60, leading GE's Charles Katz to warn {{that it could not}} be {{interpreted}} unambiguously. A reluctant short-term committee enacted a total cleanup and, by March 1963, it was reported that COBOL's <b>syntax</b> was as definable as ALGOL's, although semantic ambiguities remained.|$|E
