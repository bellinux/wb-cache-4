40|$|Government {{balances}} {{are often}} adjusted {{for changes in}} economic activity in order to draw {{a clearer picture of}} the underlying fiscal situation and to use this as a guide to fiscal policy analysis. International organisations estimate the cyclical component of economic activity by the current level of the output gap.

Our approach is different, as it rests on the estimation of a bivariate VAR. Variables used are the budget balance in percents of GDP, and the annual rate of growth of GDP.

Hence, past business cycles affect the cyclical part of the budget balance, contrary to what more traditional methods assume.

2500|$|Across {{the first}} seven years, since the entry into force of the Stability and Growth Pact, all EU Member States were {{required}} to strive towards a common MTO being [...] "to achieve a budgetary position of close to balance or in surplus over a complete business cycle - while providing a safety margin towards continuously respecting the government's 3% deficit limit". The {{first part of this}} MTO, was interpreted by the Commission Staff Service to mean continuously achievement each year throughout the business cycle of a [...] "cyclically-adjusted budget balance net of one-off and temporary measures" [...] (also referred to as the [...] "structural balance") at minimum 0.0%. In 2000, the second part was interpreted and operationalized into a calculation formula for the MTO also to respect the so-called [...] "Minimal Benchmark" [...] (later referred to as [...] "MTO Minimum Benchmark"). When assessing the annual Convergence/Stability programmes of the Member States, the Commission Staff Service checked whether the <b>structural</b> <b>balance</b> of the state complied with both the common [...] "close to balance or surplus" [...] criteria and the country-specific [...] "Minimal Benchmark" [...] criteria.

For comparison towards the Commission's <b>structural</b> <b>balance</b> calculation scheme, the UK's CACB balance was found in average to be 1–2% higher than the structural budget balance figure for all medium-term periods reported since 1998, simply because the CACB is equal to: [...] "Structural budget balance" [...] + [...] "Public sector net investment" [...] (between 1-2% when averaged over five years) + [...] "reversed adjustment for one-off revenues/expenditures" [...] (close to 0% when averaged over five years).|$|E

40|$|According to the Pact for Stability and Growth (PSG), in {{the medium}} term the net deficit should be close to balance or in surplus. We {{question}} {{the use of the}} net deficit as the only medium-term budgetary objective and as the main indicator for the assessment of fiscal policy. Hence, for assessing the short-term fiscal stance, we propose to analyze cyclically adjusted budget balances, whereas an assessment of sustainability of fiscal positions {{in the medium}}-term should be based on structural primary gaps. The OECD, the EU and the IMF calculate <b>structural</b> budget <b>balances</b> by subtracting the balance of several cyclical revenue components and only one cyclical expenditure component from the overall net deficit, under the assumption of constant output elasticities. By means of a bootstrapping simulation we demonstrate that the assumptions of these traditional methods are too restrictive. They do not even allow to determine the sign of the cyclical balances for the EU-countries. To estimate <b>structural</b> budget <b>balances,</b> we suggest an alternative approach which is based on a statistical concept and identifies <b>structural</b> <b>balances</b> as a smooth trend. Medium term sustainability of fiscal policy is analysed within the concept of structural primary gaps. This indicator shows to what extent the current <b>structural</b> primary <b>balance</b> deviates from the primary surplus that stabilizes the debt to GDP ratio. Again, the meaning of structural is based on the same statistical concept of trend extraction. For the EU-countries structural primary gaps are calculated, referring to the net debt and gross debt concept. According to the gross debt concept and based on forecasts of the OECD Economic Outlook (December 1997), fiscal policy of all EU-countries can be considered as sustainable at least in 1999. Even if fiscal policy is already deemed sustainable in the medium-term, in some of the EU-countries <b>structural</b> <b>balances</b> will have to be further improved in order to bring fiscal positions close to balance or in surplus. Only then, compliance with the provisions of the PSG is assured. ...|$|R
