5|$|Exactly 33 years later, on December 8, 2005, Southwest Airlines Flight 1248, a Boeing 737-700 inbound from Baltimore-Washington International Airport in Baltimore, Maryland, <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> runway while {{attempting}} to land {{at the airport in}} a heavy snow storm. The airplane broke through the barrier fence of the airport, and came to rest at the intersection of 55th Street and Central Avenue bordering the airport at its northwest corner. A 6-year-old boy was killed as a passenger in a vehicle that was struck by the plane after it skidded into the street.|$|E
5|$|On January 13, 1982, a train derailed at a {{malfunctioning}} crossover switch {{south of}} the Federal Triangle station. In attempting to restore the train to the rails, supervisors failed to notice that another car had also derailed. The other rail car <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track and hit a tunnel support, killing three people and injuring 25. Coincidentally, this crash occurred about 30 minutes after Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the nearby 14th Street Bridge during a major snowstorm.|$|E
5|$|One 45-minute {{practice}} session on Friday was held {{before the two}} races. The session was held on a dirty track with lap times gradually improving over the 45-minute period when the cars cleaned the circuit. Nato set the fastest lap {{with a time of}} 1:55.392, ahead of Giovinazzi in second and Sirotkin third. Gasly was fourth-fastest; Rowland was fifth and Luca Ghiotto sixth. King, Arthur Pic, Marciello, and Sergio Canamasas rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. The session was disrupted when King went onto the turn 15 run-off area and was required to swerve to avoid hitting a van parked at the corner. It prompted the activation of the virtual safety car (VSC) to allow the vehicle to be moved. Two further VSC periods were necessitated late in the session when Marciello and Gustav Malja <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track at the same corner, ending their sessions prematurely.|$|E

6000|$|Too late! Dorn {{watched the}} youth's last {{clutching}} of empty fingers, the last look of consciousness at his conqueror, the last quiver. The youth died and <b>slid</b> back <b>off</b> <b>the</b> rigid bayonet. War of men! ...|$|R
50|$|The 1983 Avensa Douglas DC-9 crash {{occurred}} on 11 March 1983 when an Avensa Douglas DC-9 airliner on a domestic flight in Venezuela from Caracas Airport to Barquisimeto Airport where it landed hard, <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> of <b>the</b> runway and exploded. Twenty-two passengers and one crew member died.|$|R
5|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting his fastest time of 1:07.967 in the early minutes. This {{benchmark}} would stand {{for the rest of}} the session as heavy rain arrived at the circuit eight minutes in. Several drivers <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track as they tried to return to the pitlane, where they would remain for half an hour until the rain eased off. Ricciardo was the first to head out again on the intermediate tyres, slowly followed by the rest of the field. With under twenty minutes remaining, the track had dried out enough to use slick tyres. Behind Rosberg and Hamilton, Nico Hülkenberg set the third-fastest time, ahead of Vettel, who spun out into the gravel trap in turn 2 late in the session.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bombers}} worked over the airfield, Aircraftman D. Roberts waited {{for them on}} the {{northern}} boundary with his parachute-and-cable launchers. Three Do 17s were heading towards him, climbing slowly. When they were in range he fired the cables. Nine rockets flew upwards. Wilhelm Raab saw the rockets go up. Although {{he did not understand}} what they were, he banked the Do 17 to avoid the lines of smoke {{that may or may not}} have concealed something. Because the Dornier banked, one of the cables that hit his bomber <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> wing before the lower parachute had time to deploy. Pilot Petersen's Dornier was not that lucky. Already on fire it ran into the cable which dragged it out of the sky. The Do 17 crashed killing all five crewmen. Oberleutnant Rudolf Lamberty (carrying Joachim Roth) also managed to avoid a collision, but before he could do so fire hit his Dornier destroying the fuel tanks. The bomber caught fire and he was barely able to keep control. Eventually it crash-landed at Leaves Green in Kent after being shot down by No. 111 Squadron Hurricanes. Roth was killed, but Lamberty survived with burns.|$|E
5|$|As Vettel {{maintained}} his lead, the stewards informed the Lotus team that Kovalainen {{had been caught}} speeding in the pit lane, {{for which he was}} served with a ten-second stop-and-go penalty that was taken on lap thirty-nine. Alonso set a new fastest lap and closed the gap to 1.2 seconds behind Vettel at the start of lap thirty-seven. Further back, Sutil overtook Heidfeld for twelfth on the following lap. Sutil tried to pass Kobayashi on lap thirty-eight at turn three but out-braked himself, allowing Kobayashi to retake the position. He passed the Kobayashi because of his higher straight line speed, but Sutil braked later and <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track, rejoining in fourteenth. One lap later, Alonso was told by his team to drive less aggressively through turns seven and eight in an effort to preserve tyre life because he was spinning his tyres under acceleration. At the conclusion of lap thirty-nine, all of the drivers had made pit stops. Vettel was leading Alonso, who was followed by Hamilton, Massa, Schumacher, Barrichello, Petrov, Hülkenberg, Kubica, Liuzzi, Kobayashi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Sutil, Button, Senna, Kovalainen and Yamamoto. A dry line began to emerge on lap forty-one as Petrov lost control of the rear-end of his car between turns seventeen and eighteen; he slid sideways into the tyre barrier at the pit lane entry.|$|E
50|$|In the {{far south}} the Massif Central forms {{part of the}} Montagne Noire Zone. This zone {{constitutes}} together with the Pyrenees the microcontinent Aquitania; {{it is no longer}} made up of basement nappes, but contains low-grade Paleozoic sedimentary nappes having gravitationally <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> to <b>the</b> south from the rising Neoproterozoic basement.|$|R
60|$|The {{visitors}} got {{on board}} their canoe, and it <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> into <b>the</b> mist. When the splash of paddles died away, an oppressive silence settled {{down on the}} vessel, and the darkness seemed very thick, for the big cargo-lamp had been put out. After the keen activity a reaction had set in: the men were tired and felt the heat.|$|R
50|$|The grommet iron, {{a form of}} toggle harpoon with an iron head, {{was used}} in some European boats at least by 1772. The {{pivoting}} head and the shaft of this harpoon were held parallel {{by means of a}} grommet banded around them. <b>The</b> grommet <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> when <b>the</b> iron penetrated the whale (or fish), allowing the head to toggle open as the barb caught in the tissue.|$|R
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the main Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted ninety minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The track was dusty when the first practice sessions were held; grip was poor and some drivers were forced onto the run-off areas after they <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track. Hamilton set the pace in the first practice session {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 40.887 seconds; almost one-tenth of a second quicker than Kubica. Rosberg and Michael Schumacher set the third- and sixth-fastest times respectively for Mercedes; they were separated by Vettel and Button. Webber was seventh quickest, ahead of Nick Heidfeld. The two Williams drivers completed the top ten; Nico Hülkenberg was ahead of Rubens Barrichello. Hispania driver Bruno Senna spun at turn nine after his left rear suspension broke and stopped on the track without hitting the barriers. Grip was improved for the second practice session, in which Webber set a time of 1:37.942—the quickest of the day—despite spinning late in the session. Alonso was second-quickest and Hamilton was third. Kubica set the fourth-quickest time. Button, who was sidelined for most of the session with an overheated exhaust, was fifth. Massa, Vettel, Vitaly Petrov, Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi made {{up the rest of the}} top ten. Sakon Yamamoto in the other Hispania car caused the session to be suspended after spinning and stopping his car at turn sixteen.|$|E

50|$|The {{northern}} {{flank of}} the volcano has been truncated by enormous cliffs rising 900 m from the sea. The sea cliffs were formed when the northern third of the East Molokai Volcano suddenly collapsed and <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> into <b>the</b> sea, about 1.4 million years ago. The landslide was so fast and powerful that it extended 190 km into the sea, and generated a 600 m high megatsunami that inundated the rest of Molokai.|$|R
60|$|But {{as these}} {{projectiles}} {{seemed to have}} no effect upon the solid back of Crab H, two great anvils were hoisted {{at the end of the}} spanker-boom, and dropped, one after the other, upon it. The shocks were tremendous, but the internal construction of the crabs provided, by means of upright beams, against injury from attacks of this kind, and the great masses of iron <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> into <b>the</b> sea without doing any damage.|$|R
25|$|On September 4, 2011, United Express Flight 3363, an Embraer ERJ-145 (N840HK) {{operated}} by Trans States Airlines, <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> runway upon landing. All 44 passengers and the 3 crew aboard were uninjured, although the plane sustained substantial damage.|$|E
25|$|May 15, 1953: A Braniff International Airways Douglas DC-4 {{carrying}} 48 {{passengers and}} five crew <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> end of Runway 36, crossed Lemmon Avenue, and plowed into an embankment. Despite reportedly heavy automobile {{traffic on the}} busy street, no vehicles were struck, and nobody aboard the airliner was seriously injured. The crash was attributed to poor braking action on the rain-slicked runway.|$|E
25|$|On 6 January 1987 a Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle 10R (SE-DEC) crashed at Stockholm Arlanda Airport. Immediately after take-off, at an {{altitude}} of , a fault with the elevator caused the nose to pitch down and the aircraft to land hard. The aircraft subsequently <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> runway and bust into fire. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair. None of the six crew members and twenty-one passengers were killed.|$|E
60|$|Joel {{ran down}} to his skiff and, leaping in, began to row vigorously across. Bostil watched while the workmen turned the boat over and <b>slid</b> it <b>off</b> <b>the</b> sand-bar and tied it {{securely}} to the mooring. Bostil observed that not a man there saw anything unusual about the river. But, for that matter, {{there was nothing to}} see. The river was the same.|$|R

25|$|On 17 February 2017 a VIM Airlines {{charter flight}} to Ufa, Russia <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> runway during take-off. The plane was {{carrying}} 40 passengers and 7 crew members. No injuries were reported. Aircraft's engine was damaged as it hit airport equipment. The runway was checked and closed {{for three hours}} after incident. Flights were diverted to Tallinn Airport and Kaunas Airport and others were delayed. The Transport Accident and Incident Investigation Bureau of Latvia started an investigation.|$|E
25|$|On 6 November 2004, it was {{announced}} that Häkkinen would make his debut in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM) series for the HWA Team in the 2005 season. He was partnered by Gary Paffett, Jean Alesi and Bernd Schneider. Häkkinen had previous experience of driving touring cars in July 2001 at the Brno Circuit alongside Schneider. In January, Häkkinen once again participated in the Arctic Rally driving a Toyota Corolla with co-driver Risto Pietiläinen. Häkkinen retired when he <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road on the eleventh stage.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday, {{conditions}} were so poor, with visibility down to mere ten yards, that the organizers scheduled an additional practice session for Sunday morning. Still many drivers <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track {{during the morning}} session. Eventually, Jacky Ickx took pole positions by a full 10 seconds from second placed Chris Amon, both in a Ferrari. Jackie Stewart in his Matra MS10 was down in sixth place on the grid. At the time, Ickx became the youngest person ever to sit on pole, a record beaten 14 years later when Andrea de Cesaris achieved pole position at the 1982 United States Grand Prix West.|$|E
5000|$|The first seasons opening {{sequence}} {{began with}} a still shot of the suburban Chicago home that the Dixons and Hales shared. The series title appeared over this still as the theme music began. The Getting part of <b>the</b> title then <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> screen to <b>the</b> left, while <b>the</b> By portion <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> to <b>the</b> right, which was followed by animation of the houses multi-paned front window zooming forward {{from the house and}} sliding open. As it slid open, it commensed a single scene in which both mothers were handing their children their bagged lunches, as the kids raced around the kitchen before going off to school. Every cast member received credit as they were seen talking to each other or walking around the kitchen. The theme song was a gentle tune with a traditional Miller/Boyett [...] "inspirational" [...] sound, and was performed by Mark Lennon (who also sang the theme to Going Places). The credit font used in these episodes was the same italicized, orange Bookman Old Style font used on Family Matters.|$|R
60|$|Owen {{had always}} been with her before, but there was now a force of habit in the proceeding, and with Arcadian innocence she assumed that a row on the water was, under any circumstances, a natural thing.

25|$|By then, the {{aircraft}} had insufficient speed to abort the landing. Aware that {{the aircraft}} most likely would overrun, the commander opted to not steer {{it off the}} left {{where there was a}} steep descent, or to the right where there were rocks. As a last resort, the commander attempted to reduce speed by skidding the aircraft by first steering it right, and then abruptly to the left. The aircraft overran the runway at 22.8 seconds after touchdown, at 07:32:37. At the same time, the crash alarm was activated by AFIS. The aircraft <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> runway at about a forty-five degree angle, roughly north-west.|$|E
25|$|After {{waging a}} {{tremendous}} qualifying battle with Schumacher on Saturday and securing a front-row starting position, Häkkinen dug himself a hole {{on a cool}} but sunny race day: first, he <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track into the guardrail {{at the end of}} the infield straight in the morning warm-up, damaging his McLaren's suspension and requiring a heroic job by his crew to get the car ready to race. Three hours later, he learned that his failure to wait for the green light to begin the warm-up session had caused his best qualifying lap to be taken away, dropping him from second to fourth position on the grid.|$|E
25|$|Advancing again though mountainous countryside, another tank <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> {{track and}} rolled six times down a 200-foot slope. The crew {{were not so}} lucky this time, as one was killed and the rest injured. The tank was a write-off. The race was on, however, to drive the Germans back, and the North Irish Horse was rushed in again to relieve the hard-pressed 142nd RAC Regt at Maria del Monte. On 3 September, it crossed the Conca river, {{followed}} by an attack on Coriana to secure the bridges crossing the Marano river. On 8 September, the regiment was withdrawn to a safer area {{in the knowledge that}} the Gothic Line had been broken.|$|E
60|$|And {{with these}} words he <b>slid</b> <b>off</b> into <b>the</b> night.

With a watchful Pinkerton's man within, and a vengeful gang of rivals without, Sanstead House seemed likely to become an unrestful place for a young kidnapper with no previous experience.|$|R
