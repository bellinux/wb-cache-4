5|$|At WrestleMania IX, Bret Hart {{dropped the}} WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Yokozuna. At the {{conclusion}} of the match, Mr. Fuji, Yokozuna's manager, threw <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> Hart's eyes, enabling Yokozuna to win the match. After the match, Hulk Hogan came to the ring to help Hart. Fuji challenged Hogan to a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which took place immediately. Fuji attempted to throw <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> Hogan's eyes, but Hogan moved and the salt hit Yokozuna instead. Hogan quickly defeated him to become the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Due to a real-life arrangement with WWF owner Vince McMahon, Hogan was supposed to lose the title to Bret Hart, but he changed his mind and refused to lose to Hart. He formed a compromise that allowed him to face Yokozuna in a rematch at King of the Ring 1993. He {{did not want to be}} pinned cleanly, so he insisted on a storyline in which he would lose the belt due to outside interference. As a result of Hart's controversial loss, Jack Tunney, who played the on-screen role of WWF President, granted Hart entry into the King of the Ring tournament without requiring him to win a qualifying match.|$|E

5|$|The Khewra Salt Mine (or Mayo Salt Mine) {{is located}} in Khewra, north of Pind Dadan Khan, an {{administrative}} subdivision of Jhelum District, Punjab Region, Pakistan, which rises from the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It is Pakistan's largest and oldest salt mine and the world's second largest. It is a major tourist attraction, drawing up to 250,000 visitors a year. Its history dates back to its discovery by Alexander's troops in 320 BC, but it started trading in the Mughal era. The main tunnel at ground level was developed by Dr. H. Warth, a mining engineer, in 1872 during British rule. After independence, the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation took over the mine, which still remains the largest source of <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> the country, producing more than 350,000 tons per annum of about 99% pure halite. Estimates of the reserves of <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> the mine vary from 82 million tons to 600 million tons.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and Crush. The rules stated that any time a wrestler was pinned, he {{then had to}} make it back inside the ring within sixty seconds or he would lose the match. Savage tried to attack Crush before the bell rang, but Crush {{reversed}} the attack. He used a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker to injure Savage and then dropped Savage across the guard rail to get the first pinfall. While Savage was returning to the ring, Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him. Savage made it back to the ring with two seconds remaining, so the match continued. Inside the ring, Crush tried to throw <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> Savage's eyes, but Savage countered by throwing the <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> Crush's eyes. Savage then performed a diving elbow drop and rolled Crush outside of the ring for the pinfall. Fuji helped revive Crush, which allowed Crush to return to the ring before the count had expired. Savage and Crush then brawled down the aisle and into a room backstage. Savage scored a pinfall and tied Crush's legs to a pulley. Crush was left hanging upside down and could not return to the ring, so Savage was declared the winner.|$|E

The most important cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula controlled access to the sources of <b>salt.</b> <b>In</b> the Postclassic, the Maya engaged in a flourishing slave trade with wider Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of hexachloroplatinic acid with an {{ammonium}} salt, such as ammonium chloride, gives ammonium hexachloroplatinate, {{which is}} relatively insoluble in ammonium solutions.

5|$|Adult {{butterflies}} consume only liquids, ingested {{through the}} proboscis. They sip water from damp patches for hydration and feed on nectar from flowers, {{from which they}} obtain sugars for energy, and sodium and other minerals vital for reproduction. Several species of butterflies need more sodium than that provided by nectar and are attracted by sodium in salt; they sometimes land on people, attracted by the <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> human sweat. Some butterflies also visit dung, rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients. In many species, this mud-puddling behaviour is restricted to the males, and {{studies have suggested that}} the nutrients collected may be provided as a nuptial gift, along with the spermatophore, during mating.|$|E

40|$|AbstractStormwater {{draining}} from impervious {{surfaces in}} urban areas often contains readily soluble <b>salts</b> <b>in</b> runoff, which contribute dramatically to the degradation of aquatic ecosystem. The concentrations of potassium (K), cadmium (Ca), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), chloride (Cl) and sulfate (SO 42 -) in stormwater runoff in the urban areas of Shenyang city were measured in 4 rainfall events during July 2009 to June 2010. The results showed {{that there was an}} obvious increasing of <b>salt</b> ions concentrations <b>in</b> stormwater runoff samples, especially Na and Cl. It is also found that readily soluble <b>salts</b> ions <b>in</b> stormwater runoff peaked at the first storm event after winter. This study demonstrated that the applied deicing <b>salts</b> <b>in</b> winter significantly contributed to the increasing concentrations of K, Ca, Na, Mg, Cl, and SO 42 - in urban stormwater runoff.

5|$|Estimates of {{the total}} {{reserves}} of <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> the mines range from 82 million tons to 600 million tons. In raw form it contains negligible amounts of Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Sulphates and moisture, with Iron, Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Chromium and Lead as trace elements. Salt from Khewra, also known as Himalayan salt, is red, pink, off-white or transparent. In {{the early years of}} British rule, the Khewra mine produced about 28,000 to 30,000 tons per annum; it increased to about 187,400 tons per annum for the five fiscal years ending 1946–7 and to 136,824 tons for the two years ending 1949–50 with the systematic working introduced by Dr H. Warth. The mine's output was reported in 2003 to be 385,000 tons of salt per annum, which amounts to almost half of Pakistan's total production of rock salt. At that rate of output, the tunnel would be expected to last for another 350 years.|$|E
5|$|Fleas and ticks {{are common}} causes of {{physical}} irritation. In {{a study in}} Egypt, a species of Hyalomma was dominant in dromedaries, comprising 95.6% of the adult ticks isolated from the camels. In Israel, the number of ticks per camel ranged from 20 to 105. Nine camels in the date palm plantations in Arava Valley were injected with ivermectin, which is not effective against Hyalomma tick infestations. Larvae of the camel nasal fly Cephalopsis titillator can cause possibly fatal brain compression and nervous disorders. Illnesses that can affect dromedary productivity are pyogenic diseases and wound infections caused by Corynebacterium and Streptococcus, pulmonary disorders caused by Pasteurella such as hemorrhagic septicemia and Rickettsia species, camelpox, anthrax, and cutaneous necrosis caused by Streptothrix and deficiency of <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> the diet.|$|E
