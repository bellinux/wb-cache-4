Industrial tests were performed at a slab casting machine at the Arcelor Mittal Poland Unit in Krakow. The tests covered 55 heats for 7 various steel grades. Based on the existing casting technology a numerical model of the continuous steel casting process was formulated. The numerical calculations were performed for three casting speeds - 0. 6, 0. 8 and 1 m min- 1. An algorithm was presented that allows us to compute the values of the heat transfer coefficients for the secondary cooling zone.

40|$|The {{control of}} quality in {{continuous}} casting products cannot be achieved without a knowledge base which incorporates parameters and variables of influence such as: equipment characteristics, steel, each {{component of the}} system and operational conditions. This work presents the development of a computational algorithm (software) applied to maximize the quality of steel billets produced by continuous casting. A mathematical model of solidification works integrated with a genetic search algorithm and a knowledge base of operational parameters. The optimization strategy selects a set of cooling conditions (mold and secondary cooling) and metallurgical criteria in order to attain highest product quality, which is related to a homogeneous thermal behavior during solidification. The results of simulations performed using the mathematical model are validated against both experimental and literature results and a good agreement is observed. Using the numerical model linked to a search method and the knowledge base, results can be produced for determining optimum settings of casting conditions, which are conducive to the best <b>strand</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> profile and metallurgical length.

40|$|The {{discovery}} {{of large numbers}} of meteorites on the Antarctic Ice Sheet {{is one of the most}} exciting developments in polar science in recent years. The meteorites are found on areas of ice called <b>stranding</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Because of the sudden availability of hundreds, and then thousands, of new meteorite specimens at these sites, the significance of the {{discovery of}} meteorite <b>stranding</b> <b>surfaces</b> in Antarctica had an immediate and profound impact on planetary science, but there is also in this discovery an enormous, largely unrealized potential to glaciology for records of climatic and ice sheet changes. The glaciological interest derives from the antiquity of the ice in meteorite <b>stranding</b> <b>surfaces.</b> This exposed ice covers a range of ages, probably between zero and more than 500, 000 years. The Workshop on Antarctic Meteorite <b>Stranding</b> <b>Surfaces</b> was convened to explore this potential and to devise a course of action that could be recommended to granting agencies. The workshop recognized three prime functions of meteorite <b>stranding</b> <b>surfaces.</b> They provide: (1) A proxy record of climatic change (i. e., a long record of climatic change is probably preserved in the exposed ice stratigraphy); (2) A proxy record of ice volume change; and (3) A source of unique nonterrestrial material...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For {{the correct}} {{simulation}} of solidification and temperature {{evolution in the}} continuous casting of steel, the determination of boundary conditions describing the heat-transfer phenomena through the <b>strand</b> <b>surface,</b> in each cooling zone of the casting machine, is extremely important. These boundary conditions are usually expressed as heat fluxes or heat transfer coefficients. In the present study, the <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> of the steel billet was experimentally determined in a steelmaking plant by infrared pyrometers positioned along the secondary cooling zone during real operation of a continuous casting machine. These data were used as input information into an Inverse Heat Transfer Code, implemented in this work, in order to permit the heat transfer coefficients of each spray cooling zone to be determined. The resulting simulations of temperature evolution during continuous casting {{have shown that the}} solidification was not complete at the unbending point and that there was a risk of breakout at the mold exit under the adopted operating conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} paper, a 3 -dimensional, dynamic heat {{transfer}} model for continuous {{casting of steel}} is presented. The model can be used on-line. Industrial examples are also shown. The model {{is applied to the}} bloom caster of Imatra Steel, Finland. Especially, the shell thickness profile and the end point of the liquid pool are calculated during ladle and steel grade change operations, when the casting speed is zero for some minutes. The secondary cooling is simulated very accurately by using sprays and rolls in the boundary conditions of the model. The on-line system includes actually two separate models, a mould model and a strand model. The mould model calculates temperatures in the copper mould. The models are coupled together and a gap heat transfer coefficient as a function of <b>strand</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> is used in the mould to connect them. The name of the dynamic, on-line model is DYN 3 D. Also a steady state heat transfer model, called TEMPSIMU was developed. This model is used to define the machine data to DYN 3 D off-line (locations of the sprays, rolls, etc [...] .). To obtain reliable results, accurate data on thermophysical material properties are also needed. The steel material data needed in the simulations is calculated by the IDS package.

40|$|In both {{continuous}} {{casting of steel}} slabs and direct chill (DC) casting of aluminum alloy ingots, water is used to cool the mold {{in the initial stages}} of solidification, and then below the mold, where it is in direct contact with the newly solidified surface of the metal. Water cooling affects the product quality by (1) controlling the heat removal rate that creates and cools the solid shell and (2) gener-ating thermal stresses and strains inside the solidified metal. This work reviews the current state-of-the-art in water cooling for both processes, and draws insights by comparing and contrasting the different practices used in each process. The heat extraction coefficient during secondary cooling depends greatly on the surface temperature of the ingot, as represented by boiling water-cooling curves. Thus, the heat extraction rate varies dramatically with time, as the slab/ingot surface temperature changes. Sudden fluctuations in the temperature gradients within the solidifying metal cause thermal stresses, which often lead to cracks, especially near the solidification front, where even small tensile stresses can form hot tears. Hence, a tight control of spray cooling for steel, and practices such as CO 2 injection/pulse water cooling for aluminum, are now used to avoid sudden changes in the <b>strand</b> <b>surface</b> <b>temperature.</b> The goal in each process is to match the rate of heat removal at the surface with the internal supply of latent and sensible heat, in order to lower the metal surface temperature monotonically, until cooling is complete.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of a regional study intended to analyze the impact of climatic changes in water resources across the Argentinean Andes, we evaluated the interannual relationships between sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> and streamflows along the Cordillera de los Andes. We selected the following rivers: Bermejo, Atuel, Neuquén, Limay and Chubut. Statistically significant relationships were observed between streamflows from the mentioned rivers and sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> in some regions across the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The Bermejo river streamflow is largely influenced by sea <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> on the subtropical Atlantic off the Brazilian coast.

Therefore, variations in the ground <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> generally reflect changes in the <b>surface</b> air <b>temperature</b> and vice versa, and in long-term comparisons, variations in the ground <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> follow trends {{that are similar to}} those of variations in <b>surface</b> air <b>temperature</b> (Huang et al. 2000). However, exceptions may occur due to the changes in timing and duration of snow cover (Kurylyk et al. 2013). Due to heat capacity differences, <b>surface</b> air <b>temperatures</b> exhibit more variation than ground <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures.</b> In this study, <b>surface</b> air <b>temperature</b> was used as a proxy for ground <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> estimation and was filtered using a 5 -year moving average (Ferguson and Woodbury 2005; Majorowicz et al. 2006). This filtering reduces the ground <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> variation with respect to the <b>surface</b> air <b>temperature</b> variation. According to meteorological records from the Sendai plain, <b>surface</b> air <b>temperatures</b> exhibited no significant trend until the middle of the twentieth century but started increasing rapidly beginning in 1947.

40|$|AbstractDespite {{widespread}} use on athletic fields, synthetic turf <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures</b> are considerably {{higher than those}} measured on natural turfgrass when exposed to solar radiation. Elevated temperatures may pose health risks to athletes competing on synthetic turf. Research was conducted at the University of Tennessee Centre for Athletic Field Safety to create a model for predicting synthetic turf <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> using atmospheric data. Synthetic turf <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> was measured on ten different synthetic turf plots (42 m 2) varying in fibre type and infill characteristics. Plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Two temperature sensors placed in the centre of each plot measured <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> on 10 -minute intervals for three 8 -week periods {{over the course of}} two years. Atmospheric data including air temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), precipitation (mm), and solar radiation (W m- 2) were collected on the same interval. Synthetic turf <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> varied due to both air temperature and solar radiation. Predictive models using these data accounted for 86, 95, and 94 % of the variation in daily maximum, minimum, and mean synthetic turf <b>surface</b> <b>temperature.</b> Accuracy of these models for predicting daily mean and minimum synthetic turf <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> using 48 and 72 -hour forecasted air temperature data was excellent (+/- 1 °C). Models using 48 and 72 -hour forecasted were less accurate in predicting daily maximum synthetic turf <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> (+/- 4. 75 to 5. 33 °C). Our findings indicate that 72 hour forecasted air temperature data can be used to predict daily minimum and mean <b>surface</b> <b>temperature</b> of synthetic turf. Such models could be used to schedule athletic events around periods of potentially hazardous <b>surface</b> <b>temperatures...</b>|$|R
