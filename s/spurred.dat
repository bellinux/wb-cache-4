5|$|Reportedly, it was SK Ull's {{forays into}} the {{district}} around Holmenkollen for sporting purposes that <b>spurred</b> {{the establishment of}} the new hill Holmenkollbakken in 1891. The knowledge of the area <b>spurred</b> Fritz R. Huitfeldt to pinpoint the location of the new hill, together with Hans Krag. This hill lay at a higher altitude than Kastellbakken, and thus had more favourable snow conditions. Holmenkollbakken quickly replaced Kastellbakken as the main hill in the district, and eventually became world-famous.|$|E

40|$|Almond <b>spurs</b> {{are known}} to be the primary bearing unit in almond tree and are subject to {{alternate}} bearing. Fruits are a strong sink in bearing <b>spurs</b> and can influence <b>spur</b> leaf growth. At the same time the percent of flowers that set fruit on a <b>spur</b> (<b>spur</b> relative fruit set) could be influenced by the competition among multiple flowers/fruits borne on the same <b>spur</b> as well as by limited leaf area on the same <b>spur.</b> The aim of the present work was to investigate the relationship between current-year <b>spur</b> leaf area and <b>spur</b> absolute and relative fruit set. Approximately 2400 <b>spurs</b> were tagged and followed over 6 years and data concerning <b>spur</b> leaf area, number of flowers per <b>spur,</b> and number of fruits per <b>spur</b> were collected. <b>Spur</b> leaf area was reduced in fruiting <b>spurs</b> in comparison with non-fruiting <b>spurs</b> according to the number of fruits borne by each <b>spur.</b> This phenomenon contributes to <b>spur</b> alternate bearing because <b>spur</b> flowering and survival in the next year are a function of the leaf area in the current year. Relative fruit set in almond appears to be negatively associated with current-year <b>spur</b> leaf area. Competition among fruits on the same <b>spur</b> did not appear to influence <b>spur</b> relative fruit set...|$|R

5|$|Culturally speaking, post-Civil War Massachusetts {{ceased to}} be a {{national}} center of idealistic reform movements (such as evangelicalism, temperance and antislavery) as it had been before the war.

5|$|The 1941 census, {{the first}} to include Dawson Creek as a defined subdivision, counted 518 residents. Its growth <b>spurred</b> by the {{construction}} of the Alaska Highway, the town recorded a sevenfold increase to 3,589 residents in the 1951 census.

The population peaked in 1966 at 12,392, then declined throughout the 1970s, rising again briefly during {{the construction of the}} nearby town of Tumbler Ridge in the early 1980s. Dawson Creek's population has remained relatively stable since then. Between 2005 and 2009, the population rose from 10,869 to 11,514, per provincial estimates.|$|E

5|$|Ayer {{has been}} a major {{railroad}} interchange since the Fitchburg Railroad opened through South Groton in 1845, followed by the Stony Brook Railroad, Worcester and Nashua Railroad, and Peterborough and Shirley Railroad in 1848. The original depot was replaced with a union station with a large trainshed in 1848. Land speculation and industrial development <b>spurred</b> by the railroad access expanded the tiny farm village into the independent town of Ayer.|$|E

5|$|Haley's {{contribution}} to the work is notable, and several scholars discuss {{how it should be}} characterized. In a view shared by Eakin, Stone and Dyson, psychobiographical writer Eugene Victor Wolfenstein writes that Haley performed the duties of a quasi-psychoanalytic Freudian psychiatrist and spiritual confessor.

5|$|It was not {{uncommon}} for wealthy or powerful families to facilitate the construction of large temple complexes, usually by donating {{a portion of their}} family estate to a Buddhist sect. Often the land already contained buildings that could be re-purposed for religions use. The Fei (費) family of the town of Jinze, located just west of Shanghai, converted a mansion on their property into a Buddhist sutra-recitiation hall, and later built several other religious buildings around the hall. This <b>spurred</b> a boom in temple construction in the area, causing Jinze to become a major center of the White Lotus sect of Buddhism, which in turn <b>spurred</b> the construction of more temples and lead the town to become a significant location within the Song. The nearby town of Nanxiang gained prominence shortly {{after the fall of the}} Song in large part to the construction of temples and other religious buildings, which spanned the entire Song empire.|$|E
