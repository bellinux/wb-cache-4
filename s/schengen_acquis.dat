25|$|The term acquis is {{also used}} to {{describe}} laws adopted under the Schengen Agreement, prior to its integration into the European Union legal order by the Treaty of Amsterdam, in which case one speaks of the <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the migrant}} crisis of September 2015, Germany {{announced}} it was temporarily bringing border controls back {{in accordance with the}} provisions on temporary border controls laid down by the <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis.</b> Such border controls appear to be an attempt to prevent disorder from making the crisis worse.|$|E
25|$|The Schengen Area {{consists}} of 22 European Union member states and four non-members {{who are members}} of EFTA: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania are not yet part of the Schengen Area but, nonetheless, have a visa policy that is based on the <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis.</b>|$|E
25|$|When Schengen was subsumed {{into the}} EU by the Treaty of Amsterdam, Ireland and the UK {{obtained}} an opt-out from {{the part of}} the treaty which was to incorporate the Schengen rules (or acquis) into EU Law. Under the relevant protocol, Ireland and the United Kingdom may request to participate in aspects of the <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> but this is subject to the approval of the Schengen states.|$|E
25|$|Like the UK, Gibraltar {{does not}} {{form part of}} the Schengen Area and, as a result, the border between Spain and Gibraltar is an {{external}} Schengen border through which Spain is legally obliged to perform full entrance and exit controls. However Gibraltar does participate in certain {{police and judicial cooperation}} aspects of the <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> in line with the UK's request to participate in the same measures.|$|E
25|$|The UK {{formally}} {{requested to}} participate in certain provisions of the <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> – Title III relating to Police Security and Judicial Cooperation – in 1999, and this request {{was approved by the}} Council of the European Union on 29 May 2000. The United Kingdom's formal participation in the previously approved areas of cooperation was put into effect by a 2004 Council decision that came into effect on 1 January 2005.|$|E
25|$|The Schengen Agreement and its {{implementing}} Convention were {{enacted in}} 1995 only for some signatories, but {{just over two}} years later during the Amsterdam Intergovernmental Conference, all European Union member states except the United Kingdom and Ireland had signed the Agreement. It was during those negotiations, {{which led to the}} Amsterdam Treaty, that the incorporation of the <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> into the main body of European Union law was agreed along with opt-outs for Ireland and the United Kingdom, which were to remain outside of the Schengen Area.|$|E
25|$|Now {{that the}} Schengen Agreement {{is part of}} the acquis communautaire, it has, for EU members, lost the status of a treaty, which could only be amended {{according}} to its terms. Instead, amendments are made according to the legislative procedure of the EU under EU treaties. Ratification by the former agreement signatory states is not required for altering or repealing {{some or all of the}} former <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis.</b> Legal acts setting out the conditions for entry into the Schengen Area are now made by majority vote in the EU's legislative bodies. New EU member states do not sign the Schengen Agreement as such, instead being bound to implement the Schengen rules as part of the pre-existing body of EU law, which every new entrant is required to accept.|$|E

In February 2010 the Irish Minister for Justice, in response to a parliamentary question, said that: [...] "he measures which will enable Ireland to meet its Schengen requirements are currently being progressed".|$|E
2500|$|To {{counter the}} {{potentially}} aggravating {{effects of the}} abolition of border controls on undocumented immigration and cross-border crime, the <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> contains compensatory police and judicial measures. Chief among these is the Schengen Information System (SIS), a database operated by all EU and Schengen states and which by January 2010 contained in excess of 30 million entries [...] and by January 2014 contained in excess of 50 million entries, according to a document published in June 2015 by the Council of the European Union. Around 1 million of the entries relate to persons, 72% of which {{were not allowed to}} enter and stay in the Schengen area. Only 7% of persons listed on the SIS database were missing persons.|$|E

50|$|Although Ireland and the United Kingdom {{have not}} signed the Schengen Agreement Application Convention, they {{take part in}} Schengen {{co-operation}} {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Amsterdam, which introduced the provisions of <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> into European Union law. <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> allows the United Kingdom and Ireland to take part in all or part of the Schengen convention arrangements. Ireland and the United Kingdom use the Schengen Information System for law enforcement purposes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{protocol}} on the <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> and protocol on Denmark of the Treaty of Amsterdam {{stipulate that}} Denmark, {{which had been}} a full party to the Schengen Agreement, {{would continue to be}} bound by the provisions and would have the option to participate in future developments of the <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis,</b> but would do so on an intergovernmental basis rather than under EU law for the provisions which fell under the Justice and Home Affairs pillar, from which Denmark obtained an opt-out. However, the protocol stipulates that if Denmark chooses not to implement future developments of the <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis,</b> the EU and its member states [...] "will consider appropriate measures to be taken". In the negotiations for the Lisbon Treaty, Denmark obtained an option to convert its Area of freedom, security and justice (which had incorporated the former Justice and Home Affairs pillar) opt-out into a flexible opt-in modelled on the Irish and British opt-outs. The Protocol stipulates that if Denmark exercises this option, then it will be bound by the <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> under EU law rather than on an intergovernmental basis. In a referendum on 3 December 2015, 53.1% rejected exercising this option.|$|E

5000|$|The Nordic Passport Union of 1958 removed {{passport}} checks at the border.

50|$|Since March 25, 2001, the <b>Schengen</b> <b>acquis</b> has fully {{applied to}} the five {{countries}} of the Nordic Passport Union (except for the Faroe Islands).
