If cancer of the esophagus is being investigated, other methods, including a CT scan, may also be used.|$|E
5|$|As a hominid brain, {{the human}} brain is {{substantially}} enlarged even {{in comparison to the}} brain of a typical monkey. The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus (four million years ago) to Homo sapiens (modern man) was marked by a steady increase in brain size. As brain size increased, this altered the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the skull, from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis to an average of about 1520cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Differences in DNA, gene expression and geneâ€“environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of {{the human brain}} and other primates.|$|E

More practically, the {{fragrance}} of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, citral, methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{distinctive}} feature of Deinonychus, the shape and curvature of the sickle claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the 'normal' claws on the remaining toes. Ostrom suggested that this difference in the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the sickle claws {{could be due to}} individual, sexual, or age-related variation, but admitted he could not be sure.|$|E
5|$|The bovids show great {{variation}} {{in size and}} pelage colouration. Excepting some domesticated forms, all male bovids have two or more horns, and in many species females possess horns, too. The <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the horns vary greatly, but the basic structure is always one or more pairs of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. Most bovids bear 30 to 32 teeth.|$|E

5|$|Around 120,000 {{species of}} fungi have been {{described}} by taxonomists, but the global biodiversity of the fungus kingdom is not fully understood. A 2017 estimate suggests there may be between 2.2 and 3.8 million species. In mycology, species have historically been distinguished {{by a variety of}} methods and concepts. Classification based on morphological characteristics, such as the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> spores or fruiting structures, has traditionally dominated fungal taxonomy. Species may also be distinguished by their biochemical and physiological characteristics, such as their ability to metabolize certain biochemicals, or their reaction to chemical tests. The biological species concept discriminates species based on their ability to mate. The application of molecular tools, such as DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, to study diversity has greatly enhanced the resolution and added robustness to estimates of genetic diversity within various taxonomic groups.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Mercury is {{not only}} {{hazardous}} to {{human health and the}} environment but could also attack equipment components resulting in a mechanical failure and gas leakage. Approach: Describes the preparation <b>of</b> various <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> Au nanoparticles for mercury adsorption by using polyol method under MW heating. Au nanoparticles have been synthesized by a polyol method under Microwave (MW) heating in the presence of Au seed ([Au] 1 /[Au] 0 = 6 of molar ratio) and different Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) concentrations (11. 1, 22. 2 and 33. 3 mM). The amount of mercury adsorbed was determined by analyzing the concentration of mercury solution before and after the contacts with various <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> Au nanoparticles. Results: When the lower PVP concentration (11. 1 mM) was used, polygonal and spherical nanoparticles were dominantly present, while spherical nanoparticles were preferentially form by using higher PVP concentrations (22. 2 and 3. 33 mM). It was found that the diameter and length of Au nanoparticles decreased with increasing PVP concentrations. When Au nanoparticles solution was prepared using Au seed, significant changes in <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> Au seed occurred. Spherical nanoparticles in the Au seed (22. 2 mM) were completely changed to polygonal nanoparticles. The amount of mercury adsorbed using 9 ppm mercury solution on polygonal nanoparticles is higher (64. 88 %) than spherical nanoparticles (18. 77 %). Conclusion: These results indicated that mercury adsorption strongly depends on the <b>sizes</b> <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> <b>of</b> Au nanoparticles. Polygonal nanoparticles adsorbed more mercury than spherical nanoparticles but the amount mercury adsorbed is inversely proportional to their size...|$|R
5|$|At present, {{the orbits}} of the Haumean moons appear almost exactly edge-on from Earth, with Namaka having {{periodically}} occulted Haumea from 2009 to 2011. Observation of such transits would provide precise information on the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> Haumea and its moons, as happened in the late 1980s with Pluto and Charon. The tiny change in brightness of the system during these occultations required at least a medium-aperture professional telescope for detection. HiÊ»iaka last occulted Haumea in 1999, {{a few years before}} its discovery, and will not do so again for some 130 years. However, in a situation unique among regular satellites, the great torquing of Namaka's orbit by HiÊ»iaka preserved the viewing angle of Namakaâ€“Haumea transits for several more years.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, bite {{marks on}} two fragmentary gastralia of the holotype {{specimen}} {{of the large}} ornithomimosaur Deinocheirus mirificus were reported. The <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the bite marks match the teeth of Tarbosaurus, the largest known predator from the Nemegt Formation. Various types of feeding traces were identified; punctures, gouges, striae, fragmentary teeth, and combinations of the above marks. The bite marks probably represent feeding behavior instead of aggression between the species, {{and the fact that}} bite marks were not found elsewhere on the body indicates the predator focused on internal organs. Tarbosaurus bite marks have also been identified on hadrosaur and sauropod fossils, but theropod bite marks on bones of other theropods are very rare in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|The {{brothers}} hired external help {{to address}} {{two of their}} initial issues: art and audio. Jamie Churchman, a former colleague at Sidhe, oversaw the visual design for Mini Metro and {{also contributed to the}} game design. They approached American composer Disasterpeace to work on the game's audio. He developed a procedural audio system that would generate sounds based on events in the game. Each level in the game has a corresponding set of rhythms and sounds; the harmonic structure of these elements changes based on the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the player's subways system. The audio was inspired by minimalism and the works of Philip Glass and Steve Reich.|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{the human}} female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the embryo called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a penis or a clitoris, depending on {{the presence or absence}} of the protein tdf, which is codified by a single gene on the Y chromosome. The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary. The glans (head) of the human clitoris is roughly the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> a pea, and is estimated to have more than 8,000 sensory nerve endings.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} characteristic of Pteranodon is its cranial crest. These crests consisted of skull bones (frontals) projecting upward and backward from the skull. The <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> these crests varied {{due to a}} number of factors, including age, sex, and species. Male Pteranodon sternbergi, the older species of the two described to date (and sometimes placed in the distinct genus Geosternbergia), had a more vertical crest with a broad forward projection, while their descendants, Pteranodon longiceps, evolved a narrower, more backward-projecting crest. Females of both species were smaller and bore small, rounded crests. The crests were probably mainly display structures, though they may have had other functions as well.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{variation in the}} <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the cerebellum in different vertebrate species. In amphibians, it is little developed, and in lampreys, and hagfish, the cerebellum is barely distinguishable from the brain-stem. Although the spinocerebellum is present in these groups, the primary structures are small, paired-nuclei corresponding to the vestibulocerebellum. The cerebellum is a bit larger in reptiles, considerably larger in birds, and larger yet in mammals. The large paired and convoluted lobes found in humans are typical of mammals, but the cerebellum is, in general, a single median lobe in other groups, and is either smooth or only slightly grooved. In mammals, the neocerebellum is the {{major part of the}} cerebellum by mass, but, in other vertebrates, it is typically the spinocerebellum.|$|E
