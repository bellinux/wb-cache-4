5|$|Sir R.E.M.Wheeler, the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India, in the 1940s <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{potsherds}} of Arikamedu site {{displayed in}} the Madras Museum, which he identified as Arrentine ware, an expensive ceramic made until 50 CE in Arizzo, Italy. Thereafter, when he visited the Pondicherry Museum and saw more of {{the findings from the}} Arikamedu site, he was impressed and thought that he had found the links between the Classical Mediterranean and Ancient India. Soon thereafter in 1945, the penultimate year of World War II, he mounted excavations in a scientific manner. He was looking for an archaeological site in India that could establish its cultural link, a datum of the Indian antiquities to the Greco-Roman period, and this quest led him to the Arikamedu site. These excavations also involved Indian archaeologists, who were trained on the site.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} quarter-century {{of peace}} <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> naval actions. The navy was used against Russia and Sweden in the Baltic from 1715 to 1727 to protect supplies of naval stores. It was {{used at the}} Cape Passaro in 1718, during the Great Northern War, and in the West Indies (1726). There was a war against Spain in 1739 over the slave trade. In 1745 the navy transported troops and stores to Scotland to defeat the Jacobite Rising.|$|E
500|$|A {{scientific}} {{team led}} by Swiss botanist Heinrich Zollinger arrived on Sumbawa in 1847 and ascended to the eastern rim of the caldera {{with the help of}} a native team. Zollinger's mission was to study the eruption scene and its effects on the local ecosystem. He was the first person to climb to the summit since the eruption. It was still covered by smoke. As Zollinger climbed, his feet broke through a thin surface crust into a warm layer of powder-like sulphur. Some vegetation had reestablished itself, and he <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> trees on the lower slope. A Casuarina forest was noted at [...] Several Imperata cylindrica grasslands also were found.|$|E

500|$|The only {{photos of}} the flights of 1904–1905 were taken by the brothers. (A few photos were damaged in the Great Dayton Flood of 1913, but most survived intact.) In 1904 Ohio {{beekeeping}} businessman Amos Root, a technology enthusiast, <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> flights including the first circle. Articles he wrote for his beekeeping magazine were the only published eyewitness reports of the Huffman Prairie flights, except for the unimpressive early hop local newsmen saw. Root offered a report to Scientific American magazine, but the editor turned it down. As a result, the news was not widely known outside Ohio, and was often met with skepticism. The Paris edition of the Herald Tribune headlined a 1906 article on the Wrights [...] "FLYERS OR LIARS?" ...|$|E
500|$|The early 1990s <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more LGBT minor {{characters}} {{portrayed in}} DC titles. Transsexual themes were explored in a 1992 storyline in Legion of Super-Heroes, in which Element Lad {{finds out that}} Shvaughn Erin, the woman he is in love with, is actually {{a man who has}} taken a sex-change drug to be with him; Element Lad subsequently reveals that he prefers Shvaughn as a male. A lesbian relationship was also implied between the Legion of Super-Heroes' Shrinking Violet and Lightning Lass, but all these non-heterosexual characters were retconned during the Zero Hour [...] "reboot" [...] to be straight. Camelot 3000 also explored transsexual themes by having Sir Tristan reincarnated into the body of a woman, to his initial dismay. Notable storylines featuring LGBT themes include the 1991’s The Flash [...] (vol. 2) #53, which had received the first GLAAD Award for Best Comic Book in 1992. Here, the reformed villain Pied Piper was revealed as gay. Another is the coming out of Kyle Rayner's assistant and an arc about his [...] "gay bashing" [...] in Green Lantern, both written by Judd Winick. These stories earned the writer title two GLAAD awards and a Gaylactic Spectrum Awards (and a further nomination). Green Lantern also has a lesbian couple, Lee and Li, as supporting characters.|$|E
500|$|In 1988's Wonder Woman Annual #1, Kevin Mayer, {{brother of}} Diana's late {{publicist}} Myndi Mayer, {{shows up at}} her will reading, saying {{she was the only}} member of the family who didn't hate him for being gay. Mitch Sekofsky, mechanic for Task Force X, is a gay dad. Simon La Grieve, the organization's head psychiatrist, refers to this as his [...] "choice of sexuality" [...] and wonders how Sekofsky's son is adjusting. Priest Kramer counsels Mitch and tells him that his homosexuality is a natural part of himself that does not conflict with Christian scripture. The early 1990s <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more LGBT minor characters portrayed in DC titles. John Constantine dealt with gay bashers in Hellblazer #6 and 7 and Swamp Thing #74 (1988). In the latter issue, Constantine, having jumped from a train at the end of Hellblazer #6, is found by gay bashers in a weakened state and severely beaten until rescued by Swamp Thing. While Constantine is not gay (he is bisexual and is mostly sexually active with women), some of his gay friends were beaten and hospitalized, and he tried to protect them. In this case, the gay bashers were working at the behest of the demon, Nergal. Both this run and The Sandman story arcs [...] and [...] arc featured elderly gay men. Transsexual themes were explored in [...] (1991) and in a 1992 storyline in Legion of Super-Heroes.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{rounds of}} the tournament <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> fan-favorites, such as Justin Wong and Naoki [...] "Nemo" [...] Nemoto, lose two {{consecutive}} rounds and get eliminated. NuckleDu was the only American player making it through the first round with a win, though he lost against Misse and Kazunoko in the following rounds, leaving Snake Eyez as the only American representative to reach the Top 8. Meanwhile, Pacheco was the first Brazilian player {{to make it to}} the Top 8 of a tournament of this size, while Misse used rarely played character Makoto with high skill to beat Bonchan, NuckleDu, and Tokido and enter the Top 8 as well. Xian won four elimination rounds despite pushing it to the maximum number of games three times, while Poongko featured three easy victories over Itabashi Zangief, Yusuke Momochi, and HumanBomb, losing to Xian before entering the Top 8. Both also lost once to Daigo Umehara on his way to the finals.|$|E

[...] On November 26, the day a video of the shooting was released, Chief Tomba is quoted as saying, [...] "Loehmann shouted from the car three times at Tamir to show his hands as he approached the car." [...] The entire incident happened in less than two seconds. The officers later found that the gun was an Airsoft gun which had had its orange safety tip removed. [...] These weapons are actual size replicas of real guns, designed to shoot non-lethal plastic pellets.|$|E

India in their second innings went on to score 421 runs with Cheteshwar Pujara scoring 153 and Virat Kohli making 96, falling four runs short of becoming the first Indian no.4 to hit centuries in both innings of a test match.
