5|$|During the 19th century salt {{evaporation}} ponds were dug in tidal marshes {{around the}} bay, producing salt for condiments {{and to be}} used as a preservative for meats. Today, due to the bay's location, east of Goose Island State Park and west of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, very little industry can be found. No industrial plants are located on the bay's shore, but a few gas and oil wells are present. The Continental Oil Company is allowed to obtain oil and gas from the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge as part of the purchase of <b>St.</b> <b>Charles</b> Ranch. Goose Island offers a few piers and campgrounds facing the bay, which encourage tourism. The privately owned <b>St.</b> <b>Charles</b> Bay Hunting Club is also found in this area, and allows hunting, boating and fishing on the bay, while striving to protect the ecosystem. The lack of coastal winds also attracts tourists interested in kayaking and wadefishing, however, boating is hindered by the general shallowness of the bay and the abundance of oyster reefs. Shellfish production is approved throughout the bay, but shrimping is prohibited due to the classification of <b>St.</b> <b>Charles</b> Bay as a nursery bay.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 September, Wolfe's army formed a line first with {{their backs to the}} river, then spread out across the Plains with its right {{anchored}} by the bluff along the St. Lawrence and its left by a bluff and thick wood above the <b>St.</b> <b>Charles</b> River. While the regular French forces were approaching from Beauport and Quebec, the Canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the British left flank, sheltering in the trees and scrub; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell back on this line during the general retreat, eventually holding the bridge over the <b>St.</b> <b>Charles</b> River.|$|E
5|$|When M-43 {{was first}} {{commissioned}} by July 1, 1919, it ran from M-17 in Kalamazoo to Hastings. It also extended north to Ionia and Stanton before turning east through Ithaca to <b>St.</b> <b>Charles.</b> In 1929, {{the western end}} was extended from Kalamazoo to South Haven, with a section still under construction. By the end of 1930, the sections of M-43 north and east of Woodbury were redesignated as parts of other highways. The Woodbury–Stanton segment was renumbered M-14, and the Stanton– <b>St.</b> <b>Charles</b> highway became M-57. In 1938, the road was extended to the east, replacing the routing of M-39 from Woodbury {{all the way to}} East Lansing where it intersected US16 as it existed on Grand River Avenue.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, M-57 was {{designated}} from M-66 (now M-91) near Langston to M-47 (now M-52) in <b>St.</b> <b>Charles.</b> By the mid 1936, the section between Ithaca and <b>St.</b> <b>Charles</b> {{was removed from}} the state highway system when the designation was shifted south to run between Ashley and Chesaning. In the process, M-57 was run concurrently along US27 between Ithaca and Ashley. The western section was similarly shifting by May 1938. The new routing started at a junction with US131 between Rockford and Cedar Springs and continued through Greenville and Carson City to Ashley. The eastern end was also extended from Chesaning to the Clio area. It was extended a second time by early 1941 to a junction with Belsay Road. By the middle of 1946, the eastern end was extended a third time to end in Otisville. M-57 was lengthened after a western extension in late 1948 or early 1949. The highway was routed concurrently with US131 to Cedar Springs and then west to M-37 at Kent City.|$|E

5|$|<b>St.</b> <b>Charles</b> Bay is an inlet of Aransas Bay in Aransas County, Texas. It is {{flanked by}} Lamar {{peninsula}} on the west and Blackjack peninsula on the east.

5|$|<b>St.</b> <b>Charles</b> Bay was {{the domain}} of the Karankawa Indians before the arrival of European settlers. The Spanish {{referred}} to the bay as Laguna del Bergantine, which translated to the Lagoon of the Brigantine. The name is the likely the source of Burgantine Lake, found at the bay's head. The name derived from a Spanish vessel that was being used to transfer money to Texas to bribe Mexican soldiers at Goliad and San Antonio in 1818. It was caught in an Aransas Bay storm that swept the ship into the waters of <b>St.</b> <b>Charles</b> Bay, landing in a creek at its base. Supposedly, the ship was abandoned in the surrounding prairie (Fagan ranch near Tivoli, Texas), and its parts used by area settlers (later determined to be the Fagan family) to build homes.|$|E
