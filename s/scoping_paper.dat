5000|$|Evidence Aid has {{developed}} recommendations on evidence in humanitarian assistance which identify critical research needs and prioritizes them. Evidence Aid was awarded funds by the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) for a scoping study, [...] "What evidence is available {{and what is}} required, in humanitarian assistance?" [...] in 2014. This report was published {{to coincide with the}} anniversary of the 2004 tsunami. The aim {{of the study was to}} provide an independent analysis of the evidence base of evaluations in humanitarian assistance. It identifies areas where there are key gaps and where there is a need to prioritize rigorous evidence on issues that are most important and valuable. Evidence Aid worked with 3ie, the Karolinska Institutet, and Monash University to develop a working paper. The first <b>scoping</b> <b>paper</b> is [...] "What evidence is available and what is required in humanitarian assistance?" ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} of general {{application}} using the Black Pearl Industry as an example. This paper is a <b>scoping</b> <b>paper</b> on some regional development {{aspects of the}} Tahitian Black Pearl Industry in French Polynesia. This paper answers the following three questions: a) Why {{is the development of}} the Black Pearl industry an important topic? b) What are some of the main aspects of the literature {{that can be used to}} help us understand this industry? c) What are some of the emerging research ideas that could be undertaken? The outcome of this <b>scoping</b> <b>paper</b> has been the undertaking of a Bachelor of Business honours thesis and the identification of a couple of possible future PhD topics. The learning from doing this <b>scoping</b> <b>paper</b> is that a <b>scoping</b> <b>paper</b> is a very useful way to give a wide overview of a new venture into a little known industry, to prioritize the use of limited resources and to explore where to go next. The planned future directions and actions are to publish the outcome of the honours thesis and to prepare for a confirmation Seminar for a PhD thesis. The potential spillovers for the industry are the encouragement of and opportunity for local residents to develop economic research skills that are not available in French Polynesia that could be useful to the industry. Possible spillovers outside the industry are that this paper is a sample of an approach that can be used to start initial work in a new industry or in a new region...|$|E

40|$|Policies {{have many}} {{unforeseen}} impacts on social-ecological systems {{at different levels}} of spatial and temporal scales. Partly because of this, both scale and governance have been and continue to be hotly debated and studied topics within many scientific disciplines. Although there are two distinct vocabularies, both communities seem to be struggling {{to come to terms with}} a shift that has common elements. This special feature has two types of contributions, three <b>scoping</b> <b>papers,</b> providing a state-of-the-art overview of the conceptual discussion, and six case study papers that set out to deal with the practicalities of combining scale and governance. The <b>scoping</b> <b>papers</b> strongly indicate that using the notion of complex systems, specifically the social-ecological system, is needed to improve the understanding of scale and governance. They furthermore confirm that both communities are shifting. Additionally, the papers show several promising ways forward to link scale and governance, even though they differ in their suggestions on most important courses of action and research agendas. The case study papers show that conceptual advances have not been taken up to their full extent in practice. Importantly, none of the papers is being very specific on the definition of the term governance. Additionally, most attention is given to spatial, temporal, and jurisdictional scales, largely ignoring, for example, network and knowledge scales. What is urgently needed are more case study papers that explicitly make use of the conceptual literature and through that attempt to link scale and governance. Ultimately, there is a challenge to more effectively include nonscientists in the debate. A transdisciplinary arena is required where the concepts of scale and governance are framed such that a broad variety of stakeholders can join the debate and/or the decision making process...|$|R
40|$|In this <b>scoping</b> <b>paper</b> for a {{study of}} parties and party systems in ethnically divided societies, Ben Reilly looks at the {{relationship}} between parties, ethnicity and democracy. The paper presents a survey of four different institutional and political strategies that have been used around the world to encourage the development of cross-regional or multi-ethnic parties and party systems. Dr Reilly notes that recent initiatives for political engineering have occurred in the developing world and have favoured a centripetal rather than consociational approach. As many of these countries are new democracies with ethnically plural societies, they face the difficult task of consolidating democracy {{at the same time as}} managing the politicisation of ethnicity...|$|E

By examining the trends and scenario of Malaysia high-rise residential property development, this paper aims to gain an understanding of impacts from the effectiveness of property management in this scope area. Findings from this <b>scoping</b> <b>paper</b> will assist in providing a greater understanding and possible solutions for the current Malaysian property management systems for the expanding high-rise residential unit market...|$|E

40|$|This is a <b>scoping</b> <b>paper</b> {{that aims}} to {{establish}} effective practices and {{key players in the}} domain of Idea Management. The paper defines Idea Management as the generation, evaluation and selection of ideas. The purpose of the paper is to map the current landscape of methodologies and tools in order to identify gaps and support the development of a framework to enhance creative confidence in idea management. The study has two key research questions: (i) what factors are influencing current idea generation practices and (ii) what tools and approaches exist for idea generation. This will help identify how creative confidence can influence the idea generation processes. Creative confidence is the capability to come up with breakthrough ideas, associated with the bravery to perform. If stimulated in the right way with a valuable framework, its impact on employees’ performance is significant in improving team members’ innovation performance and quality of ideas...|$|E
