For the single-layer systems, the carrier was employed at the packing ratios of 10 % and 20 % based on the bioreactor water volume. In the double-layer system, carriers were separated into two layers which occupied the top and bottom parts of the reactor with an overall packing ratio of 13 %. At the organic and nitrogen loading of O. 75 kg COD/m 3 /day and 0. 16 kg NH 3 -N/m 3 /day, all these systems achieved more than 96 % of SCOD removal and NH 3 -N removal efficiencies under continuous aeration. The double-layer system achieved about 40 % of total nitrogen removal, which was comparable with the single-layer system with packing ratio of 20 % but higher than the single-layer system with a packing ratio of 10 %. The SRT for the double-layer system and single-layer system with a packing ratio of 20 % could be achieved to more than 200 days. Based on the economics analysis, in the achievement of comparable performance, the capital cost for the double-layer configuration was lower than that for the single-layer configuration. Therefore, double layer configuration is recommended for the EMMC-biobarrel process design. EMMC-biobarrel process offers many advantages over the existing wastewater treatment processes including small space requirement, simple operation and maintenance and. improved nitrogen removal. It demonstrates great potential for onsite, small scale/land limited wastewater treatment applications. The installation cost for an EMMC-biobarrel treatment unit with capacity of 400 gallons/day and 1, 500 gallons/day are estimated as $ 4, 671 and $ 10, 191, respectively, which are comparable or lower than those for the existing commercial products which also involve the nitrogen removal technology.

40|$|Field {{work has}} been {{conducted}} in a 300 -hectare natural mangrove intertidal wetlands in Shenzhen, a newly developed city in southern China, to study the feasibility of using mangrove wetlands as a sewage treatment facility. The present paper reports the results obtained in the recent year, between December 1994 and December 1995. Two parallel elongated sites (Sites A & B, each 180 m x 10 m) extending from land to sea were chosen for study. Since September 1991, Site A has received <b>settled</b> municipal <b>sewage</b> {{three times a week}} during the low ebb tide period when sediments at landward regions were dry. The hydraulic loading was 20 m(3) per discharge and wastewater was soaked into the sediments within 50 m of the discharge points before the next incoming tide. Site B served as a control. Over the past months in 1994 and 1995, surface sediments and plant leaves were collected at identified locations in two sites at every six month intervals. The impact of sewage on mangrove plant growth was assessed by monitoring plant height, diameter and number of trees using the fixed plot technique. The plant density, stem diameter and tree height of two dominant mangrove species, Kandelia candel and Aegiceras corniculatum, found in Site A were comparable with those of Site B. No significant difference was detected between two sites in terms of plant growth and death rates. These results indicate that sewage discharge over a period of about two years did not exhibit any apparent effect on plant growth. The nutrient and organic matter concentrations of surface sediments in Site A were also not significantly different from those found in Site B, except at the very landward regions (2 to 40 m away from landwards). The nutrient concentrations of sediments collected in sampling locations near the discharge points of Site A were however significantly higher than that of the control. In both sites, the organic C, total N and P, NH 4 +-N and NO 3 [...] N concentrations in the surface sediments exhibited a descending trend from landwards to seaward regions, with notably higher values found in the landward locations. Seasonal variation in NH 4 +-N content was obvious, and more ammonium nitrogen was recorded in July than in December. Leaf samples of the two dominant plant species collected from Site A had similar total N and organic C concentrations as those from Site B. These findings suggest that mangrove intertidal wetlands are of great potential for natural wastewater treatment, and are unlikely to produce any harmful effect on the higher plant communities...|$|R

An Entrapped-Mixed-Microbial-Cell (EMMC) {{process was}} investigated for its simultaneous removal of carbon and nitrogen {{in a single}} bioreactor with the influent COD/N ratio varying from 4 to 15 and influent alkalinity of 140 mg CaCO 3 /L and 230 mg CaCO 3 /L. The reactor was operated with alternate schedules of intermittent aeration. Two different sizes of carriers (10 * 10 * 10 mm 3 and 20 * 20 * 20 mm 3) were studied. The medium carrier (10 * 10 * 10 mm 3) system presents higher nitrogen removal and COD removal compared to the large carrier system. The nitrogen removal efficiency {{is related to the}} ratio of COD/N in the influent. With the increase of the COD/N ration in the influent, the nitrogen removal efficiency is increased. The average reductions of nitrogen were over 92 % and the average reductions of SCOD and BOD 5 are over 95 % and 97 %, respectively, in the medium carrier system. This is operated at the HRT of 12 hours and 0. 5 hour aeration and 2 hours of non-aeration, and the COD/N ratio of 15 in the influent. Changing alkalinity from 140 to 230 mg CaCO 3 /L has no effect in both large and medium carriers for the nitrogen removal efficiency. The pH, oxidation – reduction potential (ORP) and dissolved oxygen (DO) were used to monitor the biological nitrogen removal. It was found that the ORP (range from - 100 to 300 mV) can be used to provide better effluent quality measured as total-nitrogen of less than 10 mg/L. Also, the impact of influent COD/N ratio on the effluent quality (measured as Inorg. -nitrogen) for the EMMC process is very important. Compared to other two compact biological wastewater treatment processes, membrane bioreactor (MBR) and moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR), the EMMC process with the intermittent aeration has higher removal efficiencies of carbon and nitrogen, easier operation, lower O&M cost, lower energy requirement, and more compact. The total cost requirement is less than $ 3. 27 per 1000 gallons (3. 785 m 3) of treated <b>settled</b> domestic <b>sewage</b> per day.

Uptake by and export as algal biomass indicated that between 16 - 65 % of the PO 4 -P removed was by these processes in the ponds.

Recovery efficiencies associated with this method were approximately 40 to 60 % and were significantly greater than those associated with similar methods based on sucrose flotation (P 0. 05).

The prestained cysts and oocysts had been fixed in 5 % formalin, and the recovery efficiencies associated with this method may be different from recovery efficiencies for fresh cysts or oocysts...|$|E
40|$|Populations of many shorebird {{species are}} declining; habitat loss and {{degradation}} {{are among the}} leading causes for these declines. Shorebirds {{use a variety of}} habitats along interior migratory routes including managed moist soil units, natural wetlands, sandbars, and agricultural lands such as harvested rice fields. Less well known is shorebird use of freshwater aquaculture facilities, such as commercial cat- and crayfish ponds. We compared shorebird habitat use at drained aquaculture ponds, moist soil units, agricultural areas, sandbars and other natural habitat, and a sewage treatment facility in the in the lower Mississippi River Alluvial Valley (LMAV) during autumn 2009. Six species: Least Sandpiper (Calidris minutilla), Killdeer (Charadrius vociferous), Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla), Pectoral Sandpiper (C. melanotos), Black-necked Stilt (Himantopus himantopus), and Lesser Yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes), accounted for 92 % of the 31, 165 individuals observed. <b>Sewage</b> <b>settling</b> lagoons (83. 4, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 25. 3 – 141. 5 birds/ha), drained aquaculture ponds (33. 5, 95 % CI 22. 4 – 44. 6 birds/ ha), and managed moist soil units on public lands (15. 7, CI 11. 2 – 20. 3 birds/ha) had the highest estimated densities of shorebirds. The estimated 1, 100 ha of drained aquaculture ponds available during autumn 2009 provided over half of the estimated requirement of 2, 000 ha by the LMAV Joint Venture working group. However, because of the decline in the aquaculture industry, autumn shorebird habitats in the LMAV may be limited in the near future. Recognition of the current aquaculture habitat trends will be important to the future management activities of federal and state agencies. Should these aquaculture habitat trends continue, there may be a need for wildlife biologists to investigate other habitats that can be managed to offset the current and expected loss of aquaculture acreages. This study illustrates the potential for freshwater aquaculture to provide habitat for a taxa at risk. With the rapid growth of aquaculture worldwide, the practices of this industry deserve attention to identify benefits as well as risks to wildlife...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of resuspension {{has been considered}} to be an important factor in the imperfect behavior of sedimentation basins receiving suspensions containing flocculent solids. Resuspension is the entrainment into the flow of particles that have once settled {{to the floor of the}} basin. This investigation has been undertaken to study the resuspension phenomenon and to find ways in which its harmful effects can be reduced. Resuspension has been found extremely difficult to isolate and define scientifically because many other factors produce the same overall effect upon the settling tank. Furthermore it is practically necessary to identify individual particles in order to know whether a particular one found in suspension in the downstream portion of a settling tank had earlier been settled out and resting on the floor. Laboratory studies on settling tank behavior were conducted on a glass-walled "scour flume" 1. 27 ft wide by 14 ft long with depth adjustable from 0. 5 to 2. 0 ft (see Fig. 1. 1). In order to simulate certain aspects of the behavior of full-scale settling tanks the laboratory flume was fitted with moving flight scrapers similar to those installed in primary <b>sewage</b> <b>settling</b> tanks. For some of the later tests the flume was fitted with 14 probes that made it possible to sample the tank contents at practically any point of five cross sections along the length of the flume. Most of the studies on the laboratory flume utilized a discrete suspension of gilsonite s. g. 1. 04) particles or a flocculent suspension of ferric chloride and bentonite clay particles. Tests for critical velocity required for entrainment of particles from a smooth bed showed that fine light particles are more easily lifted from the bed than was previously supposed. With scrapers moving upstream, the critical velocity for two sizes of gilsonite tested was found to vary between 10. 5 and 14. 5 times the particle settling velocity. Field and laboratory studies on one scheme proposed to improve the performance of settling tanks - a series of transverse sloping baffles installed throughout the main body of a rectangular settling tank - both indicate that baffling a tank is not the answer. Tests on full-scale settling tanks of a sewage treatment plant showed that conventional measures of settling tank performance are meaningless when the suspension entering the tank is flocculent (as is sewage). Newer measures of performance are proposed, which show promise in evaluating the behavior of settling tanks receiving flocculent suspensions...|$|R
40|$|Ocean {{discharge}} of treated sewage and digested sludge {{has been a}} common practice for the disposal of municipal and industrial wastewaters for years. Since the particles in the discharge cause much of the adverse effect on the marine environment, the transport processes and the final destinations of particles and the associated pollutants have to be studied to evaluate the environmental impact and the feasibility of disposal processes. The settling velocity of particles and the possible coagulation inside the discharge plume {{are among the most}} important factors that control the transport of particles. A holographic camera system was developed to study the <b>settling</b> characteristics of <b>sewage</b> and sludge particles in seawater after simulated plume mixing with possible coagulation. Particles were first mixed and diluted in a laboratory reactor, which was designed to simulate the mixing conditions inside a rising plume by varying the particle concentration and turbulent shear rate according to predetermined scenarios. Samples were then withdrawn from the reactor at different times for size and settling velocity measurements. Artificial seawater without suspended particles was used for dilution. An in-line laser holographic technique was employed to measure the size distributions and the settling velocities of the particles. Doubly exposed holograms were used to record the images of particles for the fall velocity measurement. Images of individual particles were reconstructed and displayed on a video monitor. The images were then digitized by computer for calculating the equivalent diameter, the position of the centroid, the deviations along the principal axes, and the orientation of particles. A special analysis procedure was developed to eliminate sampling biases in the computation of cumulative frequency distributions. The principal advantages of this new technique over the conventional settling column (used {{in the early part of}} this research) are that: (1) the coagulation and settling processes can be uncoupled by use of extremely small concentrations (less than 2 mg/l) in the holographic sample cell, and (2) the individual particle sizes and shapes can be observed for correlation with measured fall velocities. Four sets of experiments were conducted with blended primary/secondary effluent from the County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County and the digested primary sludge from the County Sanitation Districts of Orange County (proposed deep ocean outfall) using different mixing processes. Experimental results show that the sludge and effluent particles have very similar settling characteristics, and that particle coagulation is small under the simulated plume mixing conditions used in these experiments. The median and 90 -percentile fall velocities and the fractions of particles with fall velocities larger than 0. 01 cm/sec of the digested primary sludge and the effluent are summarized in the following table. The experimental results from the conventional settling column are also included for comparison. In general, the holographic technique indicates slower settling velocities than all the previous investigations by other procedures...|$|R
