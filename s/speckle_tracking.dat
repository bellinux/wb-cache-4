The basic idea of <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking</b> is to find the best match of a certain speckle from one frame within a search region in subsequent frames. The decorrelation between frames {{is one of the major}} factors degrading its performance. The decorrelation is mainly caused by the different velocity of pixels within a speckle, as they do not move as a block. This is less severe when measuring the flow at the center, as the changing rate of the velocity is the lowest. The flow at the center usually has the largest velocity magnitude, called peak velocity. It is the most needed information in some cases, such as diagnosing stenosis.There are mainly three methods of finding the best match: SAD (Sum of absolute difference), SSD (Sum of squared difference) and Cross correlation.

40|$|Abstract—The {{performance}} of a tracking algorithm considering remotely sensed data strongly depends on a correct statistical description of the data, i. e., its noise model. The objective {{of this paper is}} to introduce a new intensity tracking algorithm for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, considering its multiplicative speckle/ noise model. The proposed tracking algorithm is discussed regarding the measurement of glacier velocities. Glacier monitoring exhibits complex spatial and temporal dynamics including snowfall, melting, and ice flows at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Due to these complex characteristics, most traditional methods based on SAR suffer from speckle decorrelation that results in a low signal-to-noise ratio. The proposed tracking technique improves the accuracy of the classical intensity tracking technique by making use of the temporal speckle structure. Even though a new intensity-based matching algorithm is proposed, particularly for incoherent data sets, the analysis of the proposed technique was also performed for correlated data sets. As it is demonstrated, the velocity monitoring can be continuously performed by using the maximum likelihood (ML) texture tracking without any assumption concerning the correlation of the data set. The ML texture tracking approach was tested on ENVISAT-ASAR data acquired during summer 2004 over the Inyltshik glacier in Kyrgyzstan, representing one of the largest alpine glacier systems of the world. It will be demonstrated that the proposed technique is capable of robustly and precisely detecting the surface velocity field and velocity changes in time.

Conventional 2 -dimensional based methods of computing LV twist are cumbersome {{and subject to}} errors. MethodsWe studied 10 adult open-chest pigs. The pre-load to the heart was altered by temporary controlled occlusion of the inferior vena cava, and myocardial ischemia was produced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Full-volume 3 D loops were reconstructed by stitching of pyramidal volumes acquired from 7 consecutive heart beats with electrocardiography gating on a Philips IE 33 system (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, Massachusetts) at baseline and other steady states. Polar coordinate data of the 3 D images were entered into an envelope detection program implemented in MatLab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts), and <b>speckle</b> motion was <b>tracked</b> using nonrigid image registration with spline-based transformation parameterization. The 3 D displacement field was obtained, and rotation at apical and basal planes was computed. LV twist was derived as the net difference of apical and basal rotation. Sonomicrometry data of cardiac motion were also acquired from crystals anchored to epicardium in apical and basal planes at all states. ResultsThe 3 D dense tracking slightly overestimated the LV twist, but detected changes in LV twist at different states and showed good correlation (r = 0. 89) when compared with sonomicrometry-derived twist at all steady states. In open chest pigs, peak cardiac twist was increased with reduction of pre-load from inferior vena cava occlusion from 6. 25 ° ± 1. 65 ° to 9. 45 ° ± 1. 95 °. With myocardial ischemia from left anterior descending coronary artery ligation, twist was decreased to 4. 90 ° ± 0. 85 ° (r = 0. 8759).

40|$|Among {{the laser}} based {{techniques}} proposed for metrology applications, classical interferometers offer the highest precision measurements. However, {{the cost of}} some of the elements involved and the number of optical components used in the setup complicates using them in several industrial applications. Apart from cost, the complexities due to optical alignment and the required quality of the environmental conditions can be quite restrictive for those systems. Within the category of optical interferometers, optical feedback interferometry (OFI), also called self-mixing interferometry (SMI) has the potential to overcome some of the complexities of classical interferometry. It is compact in size, cost effective, robust, self-aligned, and it doesn't require a large number of optical components in the experimental configuration. In OFI, a portion of the emitted laser beam re-enters to the laser cavity after backreflection from the target, causing the wavelength of the laser to change, modifying the power spectrum and consequently the emitted output power, which can be detected for measurement purposes. Thus, the laser operates simultaneously as the light source, the light detector, and as the ultra-sensitive coherent sensor for optical path changes. The present PhD pursued improving the performance of OFI-based sensors using a novel and compact optical system. A solution using an adaptive optical element {{in the form of a}} voltage programmable liquid lens was proposed for automated focus adjustments. The amount of backreflected light re-entering the laser cavity could be controlled, and the laser feedback level was adjusted to the best condition in different situations, enabling the power signal to be adjusted to the best possible conditions for measurement. Feedback control enabled the proposal of a novel solution called differential OFI, which improved the measurement resolution down to the nanometre order, even if the displacements were below half-wavelength of the laser, for first time in OFI sensors. Another relevant part of the PhD was devoted to the analysis of speckle-affected optical power signals in feedback interferometers. Speckle effect appears when the displacements of the target are large, and introduces an undesired modulation of the amplitude of the signal. After an analysis of the speckle-affected signal and the main factors contributing to it, two novel solutions were proposed for the control of speckle noise. The adaptive optical head developed previously was used in a real time setup to control the presence of <b>speckle</b> effect, by <b>tracking</b> the signal to noise ratio of the emitted power, and modifying the spot size on the target when required using a feedback loop. Besides, a sensor diversity solution was proposed to enable enhancements in signal detection in fast targets, when real time control could not be applied. Finally, two industrial applications of the technique with the presence of different levels of speckle noise have been presented. A complete measurement methodology for the control of motor shaft runout in permanent magnet electrical motors, enabling complete monitoring of the displacement of the shaft has been developed and implemented in practice. Results here are validated with those obtained using a commercial laser Doppler vibrometer, an equipment with a much higher cost. A second application in the monitoring the displacement of polymer-reinforced beams used in civil engineering under dynamic loading was also demonstrated.

5000|$|Strain {{is defined}} as the {{fractional}} or percentage change in an objects dimension in comparison to the object’s original dimension. Similarly, strain rate can be defined as the speed at which deformation occurs. Mathematically, three components of normal strain (εx, εy, and εz) and three components of shear strain (εxy, εxz, and εyz) are recognized. Congruently, when applied to the left ventricle, left ventricular deformation is defined by the three normal strains (longitudinal, circumferential, and radial) and three shear strains (circumferential-longitudinal, circumferential-radial, and longitudinal-radial). The principal benefit of LV shear strains is amplification of the 15% shortening of myocytes into 40% radial LV wall thickening, which ultimately translates into a >60% change in LV ejection fraction. Left ventricular shearing increases towards the subendocardium, resulting in a subepicardial to subendocardial thickening strain gradient.

The observed differences in myocardial velocities by 2 D <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking</b> and TDI were secondary to the automatic tracking of the myocardium and angle independency of 2 D <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking.</b> Using the ratio of peak mitral E wave velocity to peak early diastolic tissue velocity (E/e&# 146;), which is a marker of LV filling pressures, quantification of peak early diastolic tissue velocity by 2 D <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking</b> is superior to TDI for identifying elevated LV filling pressures in patients presenting with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. 	 Interpretation of dobutamine stress echocardiograms are subjective and require significant expert training to obtain published levels of accuracy. 2 D <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking</b> strain analysis permits semi-automatic quantification of myocardial function. Using automated 2 D <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking</b> longitudinal strain analysis, a novice reader was able to obtain similar diagnostic accuracies as an expert reader. Furthermore, expert readers can also increase their diagnostic accuracies by including the strain analyses. At peak dobutamine infusion, a global longitudinal strain cut-off value of - 20 % had the optimal sensitivity and specificity for identifying significant coronary stenosis on invasive angiography. 	In patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, the presence of diastolic dysfunction and elevated filling pressures are known adverse prognostic markers. Various indices of LV diastolic function have been proposed, but their comparative prognostic values are unknown. Accordingly, 371 patients who presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction were prospectively follow-up for the occurrence of the combine endpoint of all-cause mortality, heart failure re-hospitalization, repeat myocardial infarction and repeat revascularization. Of the various novel LV diastolic indices, only the peak strain rate (SR) at isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) by 2 D <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking</b> was an independent predictor of the combined outcome. 	The concept of LV dyssynchrony first arose as a concept to predict response to CRT. However, {{there was a lack}} of studies examining the normal ranges of LV synchrony by TDI or 2 D <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking.</b> Furthermore, few studies have evaluated the prognostic value of LV dyssynchrony in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction. Thus, in 122 healthy volunteers from a wide age range who were recruited randomly from the community, we defined normal ranges for different dyssynchrony parameters. 	Next, we compared dyssynchrony parameters by 2 D <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking</b> versus TDI in normal healthy controls and in patients presenting with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. There were suboptimal agreements between dyssynchrony parameters obtained by 2 D <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking</b> versus TDI. Dyssynchrony parameters obtained by 2 D <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking</b> had lower coefficients of variation. Only 2 D <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking</b> could identify significant differences in systolic dyssynchrony in patients presenting with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction versus normal controls. As there were poor agreements between different dyssynchrony parameters, we evaluated the possibility of combining different dyssynchrony parameters to identify patients who are &# 147;truly dyssynchronous&# 148;. Accordingly, we evaluated the prognostic value of this technique in a prospective study of 100 patients who presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and were prospectively followed up for 1 year. Using 4 different dyssynchrony parameters, patients who were &# 147;truly dyssynchronous&# 148; had persistently impaired LV function and larger volumes at long term follow-up. In summary, the studies of this thesis have explored LV myocardial mechanics and synchrony in patients with CAD. 2 D <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking</b> and TDI are different echocardiographic techniques that can quantify LV myocardial mechanics and synchrony. These 2 imaging modalities are different and parameters derived from them are not identical. This thesis provided insights into the mechanisms underlying these differences. Furthermore, the present thesis demonstrated that quantifying LV myocardial mechanics and synchrony using these imaging modalities have important clinical diagnostic and prognostic implications. Further studies are needed to examine the utility of these techniques in other disease processes...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} and repeatability of two-dimensional <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking</b> echocardiography {{for the evaluation}} of left ventricular function in healthy calves. Animals: 12 Holstein calves, 62 ± 11. 6 days old; 75. 25 ± 5. 4 Kg. Methods: Observational study. Right parasternal short-axis views at papillary muscle level were recorded in standing calves and subsequently analysed by two-dimensional <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking</b> for global and regional radial and circumferential strains and strain rates and radial displacement. Echocardiographic examinations were performed by 2 observers to evaluate intra- and interobserver repeatability and variability. Results: Two-dimensional <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking</b> was feasible in all calves. Automated tracking was better in systole than in diastole. Repeatability of the technique was good in calves. Systolic radial strain and strain rate peak values showed little variability compared to systolic circumferential strain and strain rate and to all diastolic measurements. Variability of the interobserver measurements was greater than the intraobserver measurements. Conclusions: Two-dimensional <b>speckle</b> <b>tracking</b> is feasible in calves. As in other species, evaluation of systolic radial left ventricular function is more reliable than circumferential and diastolic left ventricular function. Peer reviewe...|$|E
