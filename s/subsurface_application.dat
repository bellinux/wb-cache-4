However, the usual practice of broadcasting litter {{on the surface}} of pastures and other no-till systems can degrade water quality by allowing nutrients to be transported from fields in surface runoff, while much of the ammonium-N volatilizes and escapes into the atmosphere. In a previous study, we used a subsurface banding technique to move litter from the soil surface into the root zone with minimal disturbance of the grass, thatch, and soil structure; and found that nutrient losses decreased substantially. Because subsurface banding increased retention of nutrients and water in the soil, we conducted follow-up research to compare crop yield and quality from this litter application method to those from the conventional surface broadcasting method. The objectives were to determine effects of <b>subsurface</b> <b>application</b> on perennial forage yield, quality, and temporal yield distribution during the growing season. Field plots were located on silt loam soil (8 - 10 % slopes) with well-established bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L. Pers.). Poultry litter was applied (6. 7 Mg ha - 1, dry weight) by one of two methods: surface broadcast manually or subsurface banded using a tractor-drawn prototype implement. Each treatment was replicated three times. There were also three control plots that received no litter.

40|$|Metam sodium is {{the most}} widely used soil {{fumigant}} in the United States. The primary breakdown product of metam sodium in soil is methyl isothiocyanate (MITC), an active pesticidal agent with a high toxicity and a great potential for volatilization. Reducing atmospheric emissions of MITC is therefore critical to maintain air quality. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the rate and efficiency of conversion of metam sodium to MITC in soil and to investigate the potential of using surface water sealing to reduce MITC emissions. The conversion of metam sodium to MITC was a rapid abiotic decomposition process. At typical field application rates, the conversion efficiency depended on the initial content of metam sodium in soil, but was independent of soil moisture, soil type, and soil atmospheric conditions. A soil column system was used to measure the emission and distribution of MITC after subsurface and surface application of metam sodium. Volatilization flux and cumulative emission loss of MITC was substantially reduced with surface water sealing compared to uncovered soil columns after <b>subsurface</b> <b>application</b> of metam sodium. When metam sodium was surface applied in simulated chemigation, surface water sealing was ineffective, suggesting the need for additional emissions reduction practices when metam sodium is broadcast. Overall, the results of the column experiment indicate that surface water sealing with <b>subsurface</b> <b>application</b> of metam sodium may be an effective and economical strategy to reduce MITC emissions while maintaining pest control efficacy. r 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

Laboratory experiments were conducted using two soils and a intert construction sand to investigate the emission flux rates of seven volatile constituents, i. e., benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, p-, m-, o-xylene, and naphthalene, from API Separatory Sludge and Slop Oil Emulsion Solids wastes in column and flask laboratory units {{as a function of}} waste application rate, application method (surface versus subsurface), soil type and soil physical characteristics. Field experiemtns were conducted at an active petroleum refinery hazardous waste land treatment site to which a combined API Separator Sludge/DAF bottom sludge was surface applied. The emission rates of the sevel pure volatile constituents evaluated in the laboratory studies were quantified in the field study. Pure constituent collection and quantification in both laboratory and field studies were carried out using a surface isolation emission flux chamber and a split stream Tenax sorbent tube concentration system. Laboratory and field sampling train evaluation indicated that the system is best quited for high emission rate measurements, i. e., just following waste application, and requires diligent QA/QC procedures to minimize background contamination and to assure representativeness of measured data. Suggested operating procedures in terms of purge flow rates, split stream sampling rates, sample collection volumes for minimal contaminant sorbent tube breakthrough, etc., are presented. Measured laboratory and field data were comapred to the Thibodeaux-Hwang Air Emission Release Rate (AERR) model in an effort to validata this state-of-the-art land treatment air emission model. Data generally confirm the validity of the diffusion based on modeling approach for land treatment air emissions, especially for emission rates immediately following sruface waste application. Both field and laboratory surface application measured data correlated with Thibodeaux-Hwang AERR model predictions within a factor of two to ten. Laboratory <b>subsurface</b> <b>application</b> experiments were within one to two orders of magnitude of predicted values. The dynamics of the geometry of the subsurface contaminated zone following <b>subsurface</b> <b>application,</b> along with the hypothesis of concentration gradient development in the soil zone above the application plane, indicate that the simple diffusion based model does not adequately describe the unsteady-state diffusion process occurring following <b>subsurface</b> <b>application</b> events. The variability observed in point waste loading, and soil physical and temperature conditions observed during the field study suggest that detailed waste loading data (using a pan method described in the report) and site and time specific soil data are required for accurate correlations between measured and predicted waste constituent emission flux rates. Once specific data are collected which describe the physical environment of the land treatment system, the accurate prediction of pure constituent air emissions from surface application and tilling can be provided by the Thibodeaux-Hwang AERR model even for complex hazardous wastes applied to complex soil systems.

30|$|Finally, we {{note that}} in this study, we have not {{specifically}} considered temperature effects. The study here was conducted at room temperature, however, for <b>subsurface</b> <b>application</b> {{we need to consider}} the effect of the elevated temperatures associated with reservoirs in the range 60  °C. Viscoelastic surfactant solutions are notorious for their loss of effect as the temperature is raised. This is because they consist of molecular assemblies such as worm-like micelles which disintegrate as soon as the temperature is raised, i.e., they are Brownian suspensions. In theory, the applied shear effects disturb the equilibrium which is restored at rates defined by the diffusivity (Larson 1999). This is determined by the Stokes–Einstein relationship to be proportional to temperature. However, in our case, we are above the concentration, size and aspect ratio of fibres associated with dilute Brownian behaviour. Nonetheless, there is an analogy here with worm-like micelles in that induced shear leads to some entanglement in the fibres which contributes to the viscoelastic effects we have observed. The behaviour under enhanced temperatures is the subject of current study.|$|E

This study aims to investigate the effects of injection velocity and surfactant concentration on foam generation and hysteresis behavior as a function of foam quality. We find that the transition from coarse-foam to strong-foam (i. e., the minimum pressure gradient for foam generation) is almost independent of flowrate, surfactant concentration, and foam quality. Moreover, the hysteresis behavior in foam generation occurs only at high-quality regimes and when the pressure gradient is below a certain value regardless of the total flow rate and surfactant concentration. We also observe that the rheological behavior of foam is strongly dependent on liquid velocity. Petroleum Engineerin...|$|R

Citric acid, at pH 5. 5, was used at different levels of concentration and retention time in batch experiments to establish optimum conditions for the maximum removal of heavy metals from the soil. Citric acid exhibited a tremendous potential to extract metal ions from the metal-contaminated soil. The extraction of metal ions increased with an increase in citric acid concentration. A column study (height = 0. 6 m; internal diameter = 0. 1 m) was conducted to compare metal leaching with surface and <b>subsurface</b> <b>application</b> of citric acid. The results indicated that the <b>subsurface</b> <b>application</b> resulted in a more efficient extraction of metal ions due to uniform distribution of the citric acid. Finally, a large-scale experiment involving soil columns (height = 1. 0 m; internal diameter = 0. 2 m) was carried out to develop an in situ soil flushing system to remediate the metal-contaminated soil. Citric acid was supplied into the soil columns through a subsurface irrigation system. This process resulted in an overall extraction of Zn, Cu, Cd, and Pb ions from the soil columns at 83. 27 %, 1. 47 %, 16. 70 %, and 26. 55 %, respectively. Results obtained in different experimental protocols suggested that continuous flushing of the soil is a suitable method for extracting metal ions from the contaminated soil using citric acid. The metal-rich leachate was effectively treated with chitosan flakes. Results indicate that for 0. 1 M citric acid leachate containing 0. 06, 0. 02, 0. 003, and 5. 87 mumoles ml- 1 of Zn, Cu, Cd, and Pb, respectively, about 20 g of chitosan would be sufficient to remove about 50 % of the contaminants from one liter of leachate in 6 h. Various batch experiments involving pure solutions of metal ions as well as the metal-rich leachate were conducted to establish the metal adsorption properties of chitosan under various physico-chemical conditions. The controlled parameters were the amount of chitosan, reaction time with and without shaking, and the pH of the solution.

Depending upon the types and characteristics of the methanotrophs identified, {{it may be possible to}} apply the microbes to other sources of methane emissions, which include landfills, rice cultivation, and industrial sources where methane can accumulate under buildings. Finally, the microbes collected and identified during this research also had the potential for useful applications in the chemical industry, as well as in a variety of microbial processes. Sample collection focused on the South Fork of Texas Creek located approximately 15 miles east of Durango, Colorado. The creek is located near the subsurface contact between the coal-bearing Fruitland Formation and the underlying Pictured Cliffs Sandstone. The methane seeps occur within the creek and in areas adjacent to the creek where faulting may allow fluids and gases to migrate to the surface. These seeps appear to have been there prior to coalbed methane development as extensive microbial soils have developed. Our investigations screened more than 500 enrichments but were unable to convince us that anaerobic methane oxidation (AMO) was occurring and that anaerobic methanotrophs may not have been present in the samples collected. In all cases, visual and microscopic observations noted that the early stage enrichments contained viable microbial cells. However, as the levels of the readily substrates that were present in the environmental samples were progressively lowered through serial transfers, the numbers of cells in the enrichments sharply dropped and were eliminated. While the results were disappointing we acknowledge that anaerobic methane oxidizing (AOM) microorganisms are predominantly found in marine habitats and grow poorly under most laboratory conditions.

Integration of conventional borehole data with more spatially extensive geophysical data (obtained from the surface, between boreholes, and from surface to boreholes) shows promise for providing quantitative information about subsurface properties and processes. Typically, estimation of subsurface properties involves a two-step procedure in which geophysical data are first inverted and then integrated with direct measurements and petrophysical relationship information to estimate hydrological parameters. However, errors inherent to geophysical data acquisition and inversion approaches and errors associated with petrophysical relationships can decrease the value of geophysical data in the estimation procedure.

40|$|The Canadian {{livestock}} industry generates 150 million tonnes of manure annually {{and the majority}} of this manure is land applied. This practice allows the manure nutrients to be recycled to the soil crop system while improving soil fertility. However, land application of manure has the potential to negatively impact soil, water, and air quality if not managed properly. Microbial processes transform the manure nutrients into forms that are susceptible to leaching or volatilization. Balancing the nutrient loss dynamics from fertilized soil is very difficult because the nutrient transformations are affected by the soil environment such as air and water content, pH, and labile carbon content. All of these soil environmental factors can be influenced by manure application practices such as application rate, timing, and manure placement. Knowledge of how these management practices affect the soil environment can help producers make management decisions that reduce the likelihood of soil, water, and air contamination from manure application. Very few data exist on how manure application practices affect odour emissions after spreading. Therefore, the efficiency of <b>subsurface</b> <b>application</b> in reducing odours from manure spreading for both solid and liquid manure was assessed. Flux chambers and dynamic dilution olfactometry were used to measure odour emissions from five livestock manure species applied at three application rates using surface and <b>subsurface</b> <b>application</b> methods. The results indicated that odour concentrations from injected plots were up to 66 % (37 % on average) lower than concentrations from broadcast applications. Injection seemed to have a larger impact on reducing odours from solid manure than liquid manure, mainly due to efficient manure coverage from solid manure injection. Odours measured immediately after solid manure applications were also 37 % lower than from liquid manure applications. In general, odours from both manure types increased with higher application rates, but there was little difference in the odours among low, mid, and high application rates. The specific odour rate (odour emission rate per kg N applied) decreased with application rate due to the reduced surface area available for volatilization of compounds with higher application rates. Based on these results, injection of manure is an effective way to reduce the odour emissions immediately after spreading, particularly for solid manure. However, other factors associated with manure injection, such as the increased power requirement and soil disturbance must be considered when evaluating the overall impact of manure injection versus surface application. The odour data collected in this study described how management practices affected odours immediately after spreading. Knowledge of how these practices affect the emission rate trend over time is required to apply dispersion models to optimize the minimum separation distances for manure spreading activities. The model parameters for an existing volatilization model were determined from field and literature data and the resulting model allowed the effects of application mode (surface vs. subsurface) and manure type (liquid vs. solid) on odour emissions for 48 hours after application to be simulated. The effects of injection depth and a coverage factor on emissions were also simulated. The modeled peak fluxes from liquid manure applications were higher than those for solid manure applications, but the extended duration of odour emissions from solid manure resulted in higher cumulative losses from solid manure applications. While the application rate had no effect on the initial odour flux, higher application rates resulted in higher peak fluxes, higher overall emissions, and longer odour durations for both manure types and application methods. Modest injection depths were shown to reduce odours from both liquid and solid manure applications compared to surface spreading. The percent reductions in cumulative odours due to injection were estimated assuming typical coverage factors. The general predictions of the model developed in this study agree reasonably well with odour emission rate trends reported in literature. Future work should focus on better estimation of the model parameters and the variation of effective diffusivity with time and soil conditions. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agricultural activities such as land application of livestock manure cannot be ignored when assessing overall emissions from anthropogenic sources. Like odour emissions, the magnitude of the GHG emissions will be influenced by management practices such as manure placement during land application. The GHG fluxes resulting from the surface and <b>subsurface</b> <b>application</b> of liquid and solid manure were also compared within 24 hours of application using a static chamber and gas chromatography. The results showed that carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 -e) fluxes were approximately three times higher from the injected plots than the surface plots for both solid and liquid manure. The elevated CO 2 -e fluxes were mainly due to a pronounced increase in N 2 O fluxes which was likely caused by increased denitrification rates. The CO 2 -e fluxes from the liquid manure applications were also approximately three times higher than the CO 2 -e fluxes from the solid manure applications, probably due to higher levels of ammonium available for nitrification and subsequent denitrification. The CH 4 fluxes were generally low and the treatments had no effect. The measured specific fluxes (total flux per kg N applied) remained relatively constant with application rate, indicating that, in this study, GHG emissions from manure applications were approximately proportional to the amount of land applied manure. While the data from this study showed that manure type and placement influenced short-term nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions, manure management practices (particularly slurry injection or solid manure incorporation) have the potential to influence long-term emissions by changing the magnitude and pattern of the nitrogen cycle in the soil-plant system. Management practices also impact the magnitude of other nitrogen losses (ammonia volatilization, nitrate leaching) which affect indirect N 2 O emissions. A model that simulates the environmental conditions and nutrient transformations after manure application may allow a more reliable prediction of the effect of management practices on total GHG emissions. Numerous process-based models have been used to estimate N 2 O emissions as influenced by agricultural practices in Canada. However, these models do not account for enhanced denitrification that potentially exists after slurry injection or manure incorporation, resulting in an underestimation of N 2 O emissions. A simple mass balance of nitrogen after application to land showed that enhanced denitrification can increase total N 2 O-N emissions by a factor of 5. By accounting for the increased microbial activity, slower oxygen diffusion and higher water filled pore space that exists after manure injection, models may better estimate N 2 O emissions from manure application practices...|$|E

Field and greenhouse experiments were conducted near Manhattan, KS in 2005 and 2006. The field experiment evaluated the influence of nitrogen (N) rate and increasing Palmer amaranth (PA) density grown alone and in competition with corn in two moisture environments. In 2006 the dryland environment was very drought stressed, while 2005 had more intermediate conditions. Weed-free corn yields were approximately half in dryland environments compared to the irrigated environment across years. Increasing PA density increased corn yield loss similarly in both 2005 environments and in 2006 dryland environment across all N rates. In the 2006 irrigated environment corn yield loss was increased by decreasing N rate and increasing PA density. Maximum predicted yield loss at high PA densities in both 2005 environments was 20 - 54 % while in 2006 dryland environment, maximum yield loss was 95 % and in the irrigated environment was 62 %. In general, soil moisture environment was more critical than N rate or PA density when determining potential corn yield. In the greenhouse study a factorial arrangement of two irrigation methods and five crop-weed combinations (corn, PA, GF, corn/PA, and corn/GF) was established with two replications and three runs conducted. Two plants were grown in 25. 4 cm diameter PVC pipe cut into 91. 5 cm lengths. Irrigation application method included a surface and <b>subsurface</b> <b>application.</b> Plants were harvested at the V 10 corn growth stage. No differences were detected between irrigation methods with respect to above- or below ground biomass production. Corn aboveground biomass was decreased {{by the presence of}} corn or PA but not GF. Below ground biomass information was presented as column totals because species could not be separated. There was no impact on root to shoot ratio, total below ground biomass, rooting depth, or root area across the crop-weed combinations except for the GF monoculture columns which were lower than all other crop-weed combinations. Future research needs to examine the light interception of corn and PA when grown at different N rates along with examining the influence of surface and subsurface irrigation practices on crop weed interactions and weed seed germination in a field setting...|$|E

Reduced tillage rice production can result in rice straw and other residue on the soil surface which may enhance NH, volatilization of surface-applied N. Laboratory, greenhouse, and field experiments were conducted to determine the effect of surface rice residue and related factors on NH 3 volatilization from an acid Beaumont clay (pH 5. 4) and an alkaline Lake Charles clay (pH 7. 4). The treatments in the greenhouse and lab consisted of all possible combinations of the following variables: surface rice straw vs. no straw, (NH 4) 2 SO 4 VS-urea, surface broadcast vs. deep placement of N, immediate flooding vs. delayed flooding. The treatments in the field consisted of all possible combinations of the following variables: surface rice straw vs. no straw, (NH 4) 2 SO 4 VS-urea, and single vs. two equal split applications of the N. The presence of surface straw increased NH 3 loss in all studies on both soils. Urea tended to volatilize more than (NH 4) 2 SO 4 due to greater straw urease activity. <b>Subsurface</b> <b>application</b> of N virtually eliminated NH 3 1 oss. Generally,a delayed flood increased NH 3 loss- Subsurface N application increased N uptake in the greenhouse. No variable affected N uptake in the field, possibly due to low NH 3 losses in the field (O to 6 % of applied N). The only variable to affect grain yield was the N application method. Split-applied N increased yield in the Beaumont field study, but decreased it in the Lake Charles study. Reduction in grain yield was not related to increase in NH 3 loss. Factors specific to each field may have affected grain yield. A high urease activity (1 980 mg urea kg-' hr'), pH (7. 2), and H-ion buffering capacity (73 mmol kg-' (pH unit) -') of rice straw created a conducive environment for NH 3 volatilization of surface-applied N, particularly urea. Soil CEC's of over 50 cmol kg-' bound NH 4 + from deep-applied N before volatilization could occur...|$|E

40|$|The {{benefits}} of using nematicides on sugarcane grown in sandy soils are well documented. The granular nematicides that are registered {{for use in}} sugarcane must be applied in a furrow {{below the level of}} the soil and covered. There are no problems when granules are applied in the planting furrow or to ratoon crops where the previous crop was burnt at the time of harvesting, but to apply granules below the level of the soil in a field with a trash blanket is difficult. The mechanical application of granular nematicides through a trash mulch is slow and costly and generally not acceptable to growers. The liquid nematicide, Vydate, has been used successfully as a foliar spray on ratoon cane in trashed fields but there was a need to determine the effect of applying granular nematicides on top of a trash blanket. The results of five field trials to compare the different method of applying granular nematicides, are given here. Responses in terms of tons sucrose per hectare to applying aldicarb (Temik 15 G) and carbofuran (Curaterr 10 G) over a trash mulch were reduced by an average of about 7 % when compared with <b>subsurface</b> <b>applications...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The Wireless Signal Networks (WSNs) use {{the signal}} {{strength}} variation of wireless nodes {{in the host}} medium as the main indicator of events or physical property changes in the medium. With the concept and application of the Underground Wireless Signal Networks (UWSNs) where the host medium is a soil, the real-time global subsurface monitoring of wireless underground sensor networks can be achieved, whereas traditional wireless sensor networks provide point sensing and monitoring. In this paper, we present two representative experiments of subsurface monitoring such as leakage monitoring and earthquake monitoring using wireless sensor nodes. However, the deployment of underground wireless signal networks has more constraint than aboveground deployment, because the radio signal attenuation {{is much higher than}} above ground communication. To realize UWSNs for practical <b>subsurface</b> monitoring <b>applications,</b> it is necessary to extend the underground communication radius. In the paper, we provide the estimations of extending underground communication radius of underground wireless nodes based on the proposed underground radio propagation model [1]. Based on the estimations, we introduce a concept of Low Frequency Wireless Signal Networks (LFWSNs) for <b>subsurface</b> monitoring <b>applications</b> as well as an experimental platform for the low frequency wireless signal networks.
