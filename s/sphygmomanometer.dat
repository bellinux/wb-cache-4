5|$|The cardiac {{examination}} includes inspection, {{feeling the}} chest with the hands (palpation) and listening with a stethoscope (auscultation). It involves assessment of signs {{that may be}} visible on a person's hands (such as splinter haemorrhages), joints and other areas. A person's pulse is taken, usually at the radial artery near the wrist, {{in order to assess}} for the rhythm and strength of the pulse. The blood pressure is taken, using either a manual or automatic <b>sphygmomanometer</b> or using a more invasive measurement from within the artery. Any elevation of the jugular venous pulse is noted. A person's chest is felt for any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope. A normal heart has two hearts sounds â€“ additional heart sounds or heart murmurs may also be able to be heard and may point to disease. Additional tests may be conducted to assess a person's heart murmurs if they are present, and peripheral signs of heart disease such as swollen feet or fluid in the lungs may be assessed.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} {{and health of}} the circulatory system and its parts are measured {{in a variety of}} manual and automated ways. These include simple methods such as those {{that are part of the}} cardiovascular examination, including the taking of a person's pulse as an indicator of a person's heart rate, the taking of blood pressure through a <b>sphygmomanometer</b> or the use of a stethoscope to listen to the heart for murmurs which may indicate problems with the heart's valves. An electrocardiogram can also be used to evaluate the way in which electricity is conducted through the heart.|$|E

2500|$|Arterial {{pressure}} is most commonly measured via a <b>sphygmomanometer,</b> which historically used {{the height of}} a column of mercury to reflect the circulating pressure.

Blood pressure values are generally reported in millimetres of mercury (mmHg), though aneroid and electronic devices do not contain mercury.|$|E
2500|$|The {{stethoscope}} [...] is {{an acoustic}} medical device for auscultation, {{or listening to}} the internal sounds of an animal or human body. It typically has a small disc-shaped resonator that is placed against the chest, and two tubes connected to earpieces. It {{is often used to}} listen to lung and heart sounds. It is also used to listen to intestines and blood flow in arteries and veins. In combination with a <b>sphygmomanometer,</b> it is commonly used for measurements of blood pressure. Less commonly, [...] "mechanic's stethoscopes", equipped with rod shaped chestpieces, are used to listen to internal sounds made by machines (for example, sounds and vibrations emitted by worn ball bearings), such as diagnosing a malfunctioning automobile engine by listening to the sounds of its internal parts. Stethoscopes {{can also be used to}} check scientific vacuum chambers for leaks, and for various other small-scale acoustic monitoring tasks.

500|$|Mercury {{is used in}} thermometers, barometers, manometers, <b>sphygmomanometers,</b> float valves, mercury switches, mercury relays, {{fluorescent}} lamps and other devices, though concerns about the element's toxicity have led to mercury thermometers and <b>sphygmomanometers</b> being largely phased out in clinical environments in favor of alternatives such as alcohol- or galinstan-filled glass thermometers and thermistor- or infrared-based electronic instruments. [...] Likewise, mechanical pressure gauges and electronic strain gauge sensors have replaced mercury <b>sphygmomanometers.</b> Mercury remains in use in scientific research applications and in amalgam for dental restoration in some locales. It is used in fluorescent lighting. Electricity passed through mercury vapor in a fluorescent lamp produces short-wave ultraviolet light which then causes the phosphor in the tube to fluoresce, making visible light.|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} and working condition of 210 <b>sphygmomanometers</b> were tested: 100 (50 and mercury and 50 aneroid) models {{were used in}} family practices and 100 mercury models in hospitals. Faults in the inflation-deflation system were common and caused mainly by dirt or wear in the control valves. Leakage occurred in 48 % of the hospital and 33 % of the family practice <b>sphygmomanometers.</b> In the mercury models the mercury or air vents were often in an unsatisfactory condition or the calibrated glass tube dirty. The accuracy of the gauges was examined at 90 and 150 mm Hg: fewer than 2 % of the mercury <b>sphygmomanometers</b> but 30 % of the aneroid models had errors greater than +/- 4 mm Hg at either pressure. Over half of the cuffs examined had bladders widths less than the recommended size, and 94 % had bladders shorter than the length recommended for use on normal adults. Mercury <b>sphygmomanometers</b> should be bought in preference to aneroid models as they are more accurate, less expensive in the long term, and can be maintained by the owner; they should be checked every six to 12 months depending on usage.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the <b>sphygmomanometers</b> calibration accuracy {{and the physical}} conditions of the cuff-bladder, bulb, pump, and valve. METHODS: Sixty hundred and forty five aneroid <b>sphygmomanometers</b> were evaluated, 521 used in private practice and 124 used in hospitals. Aneroid manometers were tested against a properly calibrated mercury manometer and were considered calibrated when the error was <= 3 mm Hg. The physical conditions of the cuffs-bladder, bulb, pump, and valve were also evaluated. RESULTS: Of the aneroid <b>sphygmomanometers</b> tested, 51 % of those used in private practice and 56 % of those used in hospitals {{were found to be}} not accurately calibrated. Of these, the magnitude of inaccuracy ranged from 4 to 8 mm Hg in 70 % and 51 % of the devices, respectively. The problems found in the cuffs - bladders, bulbs, pumps, and valves of the private practice and hospital devices were bladder damage (34 % vs. 21 %, respectively), holes/leaks in the bulbs (22 % vs. 4 %, respectively), and rubber aging (15 % vs. 12 %, respectively). Of the devices tested, 72 % revealed at least one problem interfering with blood pressure measurement accuracy. CONCLUSION: Most of the manometers evaluated, whether used in private practice or in hospitals, were found to be inaccurate and unreliable, and their use may jeopardize the diagnosis and treatment of arterial hypertension...|$|R

40|$|Background: The manual {{recording}} of {{blood pressure is}} widely accepted to be more accurate than the {{recording of}} blood pressure using an automated device. Despite this many western healthcare systems have moved almost entirely to the automated recording of this important vital sign using oscillometric devices. Such devices may either fail to record the patientâ€™s blood pressure in persistent hypotension or may give inaccurate readings in people with arteriosclerotic or atherosclerotic changes. This paper explores the importance of manual blood pressure recording, the availability of aneroid <b>sphygmomanometers</b> in UK hospitals {{and the maintenance of}} the skills of the workforce following initial nurse education. Methods: Using a survey of nursing students to explore what opportunities they have to practice manual blood pressures in the clinical setting, the paper explores the maintenance of skills following initial nurse education. The paper also describes the results of data collection, using unobtrusive methods, regarding the availability of aneroid <b>sphygmomanometers</b> in general and specialist hospital facilities in Northern England (UK). Data using both methods were collected in the spring of 2014. Results: The results suggest that despite most hospitals having some aneriod <b>sphygmomanometers</b> available (mean was 1 device for every 6 beds in acute, 1 device for every 3 beds in specialist hospitals and 1 device for every 12 beds in mental health) they were rarely used in clinical practice with only 35 % of students reporting that they had undertaken a manual blood pressure in a clinical setting {{during the first year of}} their course. In addition, some hospitals had no aneroid devices and several others had n...|$|R
25|$|Traditionally, blood {{pressure}} was measured non-invasively using a mercury manometer and this is still generally considered the gold standard.
