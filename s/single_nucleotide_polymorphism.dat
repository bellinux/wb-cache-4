40|$|Background: Large-scale {{epidemiological}} studies support {{an important role}} for susceptibility genes in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, with phosphodiesterase 4 D identified as the first gene predisposing to ischemic stroke. Several <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> within the phosphodiesterase 4 D gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of stroke. Aim: Undertake a multivariate analysis of six <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> within the phosphodiesterase 4 D gene in a previously defined Australian stroke cohort, to determine whether these <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> have an association with ischemic stroke. Methods: This case–control study was performed using an existing genetic database of 180 ischemic stroke patients and 301 community controls, evaluated previously for cerebrovascular risk factors (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, smoking and history of stroke in a first-degree relative). Based on previously reported associations with large vessel disease, ischemic stroke, cardioembolic stroke or a mixture of these, six <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> in the phosphodiesterase 4 D gene were selected for study, these being <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> 13, 19, rs 152312, 45, 83 and 87, based on previously utilized DeCODE nomenclature. <b>Single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> were genotyped using a sequence-specific polymerase chain reaction method and gel electrophoresis. Logistic regression was undertaken to determine the relevance of each polymorphism to stroke. Further analysis was undertaken to determine the risk of stroke following stratification for stroke sub-type and etiology. Results: Significant odds ratios {{were found to be}} associated with cardioembolic strokes in two <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> polymorphisms: rs 152312 and SNP 45 (P< 0 · 05). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated an association between cardioembolic stroke and phosphodiesterase 4 D <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> rs 152312 and 45. No significant association was found for the other four <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> investigated within the phosphodiesterase 4 D gene. We propose that the results from this Australian population support the concept that a large prospective international study is required to investigate the role of phosphodiesterase 4 D in the cardiogenic cause of ischemic stroke.

Association studies for <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> in genes encoding steroid 5 alpha-reductase, estrogen receptors 1 and 2, and activating transcription factor 3 have been equivocal. We examined whether nonreplication of findings for 4 <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> in these genes {{could be due to}} interaction with environmental exposures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We genotyped 712 Dutch hypospadias case-parent triads for the 4 <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms,</b> used questionnaire information to determine exposures and performed association tests using the log-linear approach. We studied gene-environment interactions for the 4 <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> with exposure to estrogens, cytokines or cigarette smoke, multiple birth, being born small for gestational age, maternal hypertension or preeclampsia, high body mass index or primiparity. In addition, the presence of maternal genetic and parent of origin effects was tested.

25|$|In hamsters, the CK1ε-tau {{mutation}} {{was first}} discovered by Michael Menaker and colleagues while studying a laboratory shipment of Syrian hamsters. The prominent phenotype in the mutant hamsters was an unusually short free-running period — 22 hours in heterozygotes, and 20 hours in homozygotes for the mutation—making this allele semidominant. The gene was later mapped and identified by Joseph Takahashi and colleagues, which revealed a single base-pair C-to-T substitutional mutation in the hamster CK1ε gene. This <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphism</b> (SNP) {{results in an}} arginine-to-cysteine substitution in a phosphate recognition domain region of CK1ε, a highly conserved region of the gene across mammals.

25|$|The {{only known}} albino gorilla – named Snowflake – was a wild-born western lowland gorilla {{originally}} from Equatorial Guinea.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{examine the}} role of the IRF 6 {{mutations}} in Polish families with Van der Woude syndrome and popliteal pterygium syndrome and to determine the effect of IRF 6 <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> (rs 7552506, rs 2013162, and rs 2235375) on cleft lip and/or palate susceptibility. DESIGN IRF 6 mutation screening was performed by direct sequencing of all coding exons of the gene and their flanking intronic regions. Cosegregation analysis was performed to establish the relation of <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> and cleft lip and/or palate phenotypes. PATIENTS We screened the IRF 6 gene in eight families with clinical recognition of Van der Woude syndrome and popliteal pterygium syndrome. RESULTS In five families we identified pathogenic mutations, all affecting the DNA-binding or the protein-binding domain of IRF 6. Two of the mutations were novel-a missense mutation Arg 31 Thr and a small deletion Trp 40 Glyfs* 23. In most cases we found also a haplotype of three <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> polymorphisms-rs 7552506, rs 2013162, and rs 2235375. The association of the <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> and cleft lip and/or palate susceptibility has been previously published. The variants did not cosegregate with phenotype in examined families nor did they cosegregate with pathogenic mutations. The <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> were deemed not causative, due to their presence in unaffected family members. CONCLUSIONS Two novel mutations (Arg 31 Thr and Trp 40 Glyfs* 23) in the IRF 6 gene were identified to be causative for Van der Woude and popliteal pterygium syndromes. In the present study no association between the <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> rs 7552506, rs 2013162, and rs 2235375 and the cleft lip and/or palate phenotype was found.

We aimed {{to determine how}} a range of <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> in monoaminergic genes influence this response to treatment and how they interact with childhood trauma and recent life stress in a Chinese sample. An initial study of monoaminergic coding region <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> identified significant associations of TPH 2 and HTR 1 B <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> with treatment response that showed interactions with childhood and recent life stress, respectively (Xu et al., 2012).

Response to 6 weeks’ antidepressant treatment was determined by change in the 17 -item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score, and previous stressful events were evaluated by the Life Events Scale and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form. Results: Three TPH 2 <b>single</b> <b>nucleotide</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> (rs 11178998, rs 7963717, and rs 2171363) {{were significantly associated with}} antidepressant response in this Chinese sample, as was a haplotype in TPH 2 (rs 2171363 and rs 1487278). One of these, rs 2171363, showed a significant interaction with childhood adversity in its association with antidepressant response.
