In this study, we developed long chro-nologies of several cell <b>structure</b> <b>variables</b> (e. g., average lumen area and cell wall thickness) from P. sylvestris growing in northeastern Germany and investigated the influence of climate on ring widths and cell <b>structure</b> <b>variables.</b> We found signifi-cant correlations between cell <b>structure</b> <b>variables</b> and temperature, and between tree-ring width and relative humidity and vapor pressure, respectively, enabling the development of robust reconstructions from temperate sites that have not yet been realized.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{controls}} on functional surface cover types in four catchments along a semi-arid to arid precipitation gradient {{in the northern}} Negev Desert of Israel. First, we selected four functional types, based on their unique water use and redistribution functionality: shrubs, Asphodelus ramosus, other herbaceous plants and surface crusts. We estimated percentage of surface covered by these functional types and by bedrock outcrops and loose surface stones. Additionally data was collected on soil depth, relative elevation, insolation, slope, curvature, and overlain with surface cover maps. Relations between functional types and landscape <b>structure</b> <b>variables</b> were analyzed with descriptive statistics. The landscape <b>structure</b> <b>variables</b> bedrock, relative elevation, soil depth and surface stones explained most of the cover variance in the catchments. In catchments with many bedrock outcrops, functional types were best explained by the landscape <b>structure</b> <b>variables.</b> In catchments with homogeneous soils reaching beyond the root zone, the biological interactions between functional types were more important. Along the precipitation gradient the explanatory power of the biological variables decreased with decreasing precipitation, while the explanatory power of landscape <b>structure</b> <b>variables</b> appeared unrelated. Only in homogeneous semi-arid catchments regular vegetation patterns can develop, in arid and heterogeneous catchments irregular patterns dominate...|$|R

In particular, the inflation risk premium, real interest rate risk premium and both the real rate and expected inflation volatility arise as potential determinants. We use a flexible VAR-model to measure these four term <b>structure</b> <b>variables</b> and show that they account for the bulk of variation in the ARM share. Risk premia alone explain sixty percent of the time variation in mortgage choice. Other term <b>structure</b> <b>variables,</b> such as the yield spread, seem only weakly related to the ARM share.

40|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that market <b>structure</b> <b>variables</b> influence technical change, growth and new product introductions. Based on a broad data set for new product introductions in various food industries, it is elaborated in this article how market <b>structure</b> <b>variables</b> affect innovative activities in the US food sector. It is different from earlier studies {{in the way that}} cross-sectional and time-series data are combined and panel data models are used in the econometric analysis. A major result is that new product introductions are driven by market <b>structure</b> <b>variables</b> and industry-specific characteristics, i. e. fixed effects. A significant determinant of new food product introductions is the concentration ratio which affects the number of innovations in a nonlinear form. The fixed-effects estimates reveal a U-type effect of concentration on innovations. Furthermore, the number of firms, the degree of existing product differentiation and the size of a market show a positive influence on the number of innovations. From a methodological point of view, plain OLS models yield biased results on the concentration-innovation linkage and on the relationship between the size of a market and innovations. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} include sector-specific characteristics as is done in the fixed-effects models. ...|$|R
