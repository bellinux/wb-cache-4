40|$|This work used a {{hydrophobic}} polymer pair, i. e. polystyrene (PS) and polyisoprene (PI), {{to construct}} well-organized polymer templates for the patterning of proteins through a <b>selective</b> <b>adsorption</b> <b>process.</b> This is a bottom-up method to pattern proteins. The nanopatterned protein surfaces {{were used as}} substrates to investigate cell adhesion behaviour. PS-b-PI copolymer ultrathin films formed well-ordered two-dimensional surface structures after spin-coating because of the confinement of substrate-polymer and polymer-air interfaces. A symmetric diblock copolymer film with an 18 nm thickness formed a structure with PI dots dispersed in a PS matrix, and an asymmetric diblock copolymer film of the same thickness formed a stripe-like structure. After incubating these templates in bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution, the ring-like and stripe-like protein nanopatterns were prepared, which resembled their underlying copolymer templates. ToF-SIMS confirmed {{that there is more}} BSA adsorption on the PS-b-PI template surface when there is more PS component exposed on the surface. Further, AFM and SIMS analysis confirmed that BSA molecules were localized on the PS domains rather than on the PI domains. The protein's selective adsorption is attributed to the great mobility of PI chains at room temperature. The PS, PI, PS-b-PI binary and ternary blends also formed a variety of structures. For thick films, the free surfaces of films are entirely covered by a thin PI layer because its surface energy is lower than PS. When the film thickness is less than 15 nm, both PS and PI components were exposed on the free surface. The resulting complicated surface structures also patterned BSA molecules. After an extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin (FN), was adsorbed on copolymer substrates, the ring-like and stripe-like FN nanopatterns were incubated in CHO cell suspensions. The ring-like FN pattern adhered more cells than the stripe-like and the control surfaces. The cells on the ring-like FN surface formed more actin fibers and spread better. This {{can be explained by the}} ring-like pattern increasing the FN ligand local density and further increasing the integrin clusters and focal adhesion. The ECM protein nanopattern has relevance for tissue engineering...|$|E
40|$|A {{conditioning}} film, the pellicle, {{of which}} many salivary proteins are important constituents, covers the surfaces {{present in the}} mouth. The pellicle forms in a <b>selective</b> <b>adsorption</b> <b>process,</b> and it has protective and lubricating functions {{as well as an}} influence on the adherence of oral microbes that ultimately leads to the development of dental plaque. Understanding the interactions responsible for the selective pellicle formation would make it possible to strive at creating a pellicle that serves its protective and lubricating functions and also promotes a healthy biofilm {{for the benefit of the}} individual. The aim of this research was to characterize the adsorption of salivary proteins to different types of substrates, to evaluate the influence of different protein-surface interactions on the adsorption process, and also to assess substrate dependent differences in film composition. Furthermore, as it is well known that complexes form between different salivary proteins and mucins (large glycoproteins) in bulk saliva, the aim was also to study interactions between mucins and other pellicle constituents at the solid/liquid interface. Additionally, the effects of a surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), on the protein films were investigated, to evaluate the stability of the films and also the possibilities to completely remove the in vivo formed pellicle. The adsorption experiments were performed in vitro using null ellipsometry, by which parameters such as adsorbed amount per unit area and average layer thickness can be obtained. Hydrophilic and hydrophobized silica were used as model substrates. The adsorption behaviour of the cationic, antimicrobial proteins lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase, lysozyme, and histatin 5 indicated that the adsorption on hydrophilic substrates was mainly driven by electrostatics, while on hydrophobized substrates hydrophobic interactions also influenced the adsorption process. Furthermore, it was shown that 12 sequential alternating adsorption of the anionic salivary mucin MUC 5 B and lactoperoxidase resulted in the build-up of multilayered structures on the surface. The rate of build-up was influenced by the surface characteristics. Sequential adsorption studies showed that neither MUC 5 B nor human whole saliva (HWS) was able to exchange substantial amounts of the pre-adsorbed anionic pellicle proteins acidic proline-rich protein 1 (PRP- 1) or statherin, respectively. The resistance of the adsorbed mixed protein films to SDS elution depended on surface properties as well as on the number of layers adsorbed and adsorbed components. Pre-adsorbed PRP- 1 was to some extent protected from SDS elution by the sequential adsorption of MUC 5 B to the PRP- 1 film. Pellicles formed on natural tooth enamel were collected in vivo and investigated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE). Mechanicallyassisted SDS elution was used to collect the in vivo formed pellicle. The effectiveness of the collection procedure was validated in vitro by means of mechanical removal in combination with HCl treatment. The results indicated that rubbing the tooth surfaces with fibre pellets soaked in 0. 5 % (w/v) SDS was sufficient to completely remove the pellicle from human enamel. In addition, 2 -DE analysis of pellicles formed in vitro on human enamel and the dental materials titanium and poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) showed differences in composition when compared to each other, revealing that the pellicle is influenced by the substrate properties...|$|E

A brief summary of previous work is reported to position these recent advances in the context of three decades of studies devoted to the characterization of these materials. Quantum mechanics modeling of both the structure and reactivity of the material is also reported, providing complementary information. Insights related to the properties of the catalysts obtained recently using this molecular approach are presented to demonstrate that this material behaves as a supermolecule. In addition to its adsorption properties, the zeolite Y is one of the most popular zeolite used in catalysis.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{nanopore}} diffusion {{on the performance}} of <b>adsorption</b> separation <b>processes</b> is reviewed. Zeolite membrane processes and kinetically <b>selective</b> cyclic <b>adsorption</b> <b>processes</b> depend for their selectivity on differences in intracrystalline diffusion rates so these processes are designed to operate under conditions of intracrystalline diffusion control. In contrast, the performance of equilibrium based <b>adsorption</b> separation <b>processes</b> is adversely affected by diffusional resistance so in such processes the minimization of all resistances to mass transfer is a major design objective. Zeolite catalyzed reactions constitute a further important class of processes in which intrusion of diffusional resistance can be either advantageous or disadvantageous. Such effects are illustrated by considering in detail the conversion of methanol to light olefins (MTO) over SAPO 34. Within the chemical process industries diffusion is important over a wide range of length scales. In this paper we focus only on diffusion at the nanometer scale since diffusional phenomena on this scale are critically important in <b>adsorption</b> separation <b>processes</b> as well as in many heterogeneous catalytic systems.

All of the MBDP_X materials have been characterized {{through a combination of}} techniques. IR spectroscopy proved the effective presence of tags, while X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) witnessed their isoreticular nature. Simultaneous TG/DSC analyses (STA) demonstrated their remarkable thermal stability, while variable-temperature XRPD experiments highlighted their high degree of ﬂexibility related to guest-induced ﬁt processes of the solvent molecules included in the channels. A structural isomer of the parent NiBDP was obtained with a sulfonate tagged ligand, H 2 BDP_SO 3 H. Structure solution from powder diffraction data collected at three different temperatures (room temperature, 90, and 250 °C) allowed the determination of its structure and the comprehension of its solvent-related ﬂexible behavior. Finally, the potential application of the tagged MOFs in <b>selective</b> <b>adsorption</b> <b>processes</b> for gas separation and puriﬁcation purposes was investigated by conventional single component adsorption isotherms, as well as by advanced experiments of pulse gas chromatography and breakthrough curve measurements. Noteworthy, the results show that functionalization does not improve the adsorption selectivity (partition coefficients) for the resolution of gas mixtures characterized by similar high quadrupole moments (e. g., CO 2 /C 2 H 2); however, the resolution of gas mixtures containing molecules with highly differentiated polarities (i. e., N 2 /CO 2 or CH 4 /CO 2) is highly improved...|$|R

Chapter 1 An introduction to MOFs and the current research, including {{a description of the}} synthesis and characterisation process, various applications and some known MOFs from the literature. A general experimental techniques section is included describing the various techniques used in this research. Chapter 2 A series of isostructural Cu(II) frameworks, NOTT- 150 – 153, have been synthesised containing different functional groups. The four functional groups (CH 3, NH 2, OH and COOH) have been chosen to investigate how they affect the <b>selective</b> <b>adsorption</b> of CO 2 over other gases. The polarity of the functional groups is a key factor as the protons can form hydrogen bonds to guest molecules in the framework. The lone electron pairs on some of the functional groups also contribute to the <b>selective</b> <b>adsorption</b> of CO 2 by binding to the C atom to form a T-shaped interaction. The selectivity of CO 2 adsorption has been studied against CH 4 and N 2 at 298 and 273 K, with a specific focus on how each group binds to individual CO 2 molecules, and the strength of these interactions, to determine the best functional group for CO 2 selectivity. Chapter 3 Group II MOFs are rare in the literature due to their tendency to form dense 2 D layered structures. A series of 3 D MOFs containing Group II metal ions that feature 1 D porous channels have been synthesised. NOTT- 408 (Ca) and NOTT- 410 (Ba) were synthesised with a tolyl- 2, 4, 6 -tribenzoate linker, and are stable to desolvation and exhibit permanent porosity upon activation. The porous frameworks are utilised in gas sorption experiments to determine which metal centre, Ca(II) or Ba(II), has the propensity for greater <b>selective</b> <b>adsorption</b> of CO 2. Gas sorption experiments were performed at 298 and 273 K over a pressure range of 0 – 1 bar to determine the <b>selective</b> <b>adsorption</b> of CO 2 over CH 4 and N 2; and both frameworks were compared to the selectivity exhibited in a Mg(II) MOF, Mg-MOF- 74.

The NOTT- 150 – 153 series of frameworks have shown a small increase in selectivity depending on the choice of functional group. The lone electron pairs on the NH 2 and OH functional groups interact with unsaturated C 2 -hydrocarbons, increasing their <b>selective</b> <b>adsorption.</b> The COOH functional group partially fills Cage A within the structure making diffusion through the pores more difficult for larger molecules. This is best shown in the <b>selective</b> <b>adsorption</b> of C 2 H 2 vs CH 4 which is significantly higher in NOTT- 153 (191. 9 at zero loading and 298 K), than in the other frameworks. NOTT- 408 (Ca) and 410 (Ba) have shown good selectivity for the C 2 -hydrocarbons due to the narrow pore channels within the frameworks...|$|R

Before and after the <b>adsorption</b> <b>process,</b> the membranes were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The concentration of the metal ions after <b>adsorption</b> <b>process</b> was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The tannery water showed more Cr 6 + content and was removed by the adsorbents efficiently up to 30 % using QPSF membranes.|$|R

40|$|Silica gel with a {{specific}} area of 382 m 2 g- 1 and an average pore diameter of 60 Å was chemically modified with 2 -amino- 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazole, {{for the purpose of}} <b>selective</b> <b>adsorption</b> of heavy metals ions and possible use as a chemically modified carbon paste electrode (CMCPE). The following properties of this functionalized silica gel are discussed: <b>selective</b> <b>adsorption</b> of heavy metal ions measured by batch and chromatographic column techniques, and utilization as preconcentration agent in a chemically modified carbon paste electrode (CMCPE) for determination of mercury(II). The chemical selectivity of this functional group and the selectivity of voltammetry were combined for preconcentration and determination. © 2006 Sociedade Brasileira de Química...|$|R
40|$|Pure β-MnO 2 oxide was {{synthesized}} by hydrothermal {{synthesis of}} MnSO 4 H 2 O and (NH 4) 2 S 2 O 8. Spinel-type Li 4 Mn 5 O 12 precursors were synthesized via low temperature solid-phase reaction. Furthermore, MnO 2 ion-sieves with Li + <b>selective</b> <b>adsorption</b> property were {{prepared by the}} acid treatment process to completely extract Li + from the spinel Li 4 Mn 5 O 12 precursor. The effects of hydrothermal and solid-phase reaction process on the nanostructure, chemical stability and ion-exchange property of the ion-sieve material were examined with XRD, HRTEM, SAED, and Li + <b>selective</b> <b>adsorption</b> measurements. The results show that Li 4 Mn 5 O 12 precursor and final MnO 2 ion-sieve are effectively controlled within low-dimensional structure, indicating that low temperature solid-phase reaction is more favorable to control the nanocrystalline structure than traditional high-temperature calcination process. The Li + <b>selective</b> <b>adsorption</b> capacity is improved remarkably to 6. 6 mmol/g at equilibrium and about 5. 0 mmol/g at the initial Li + concentration of only 5. 0 mmol/L, which is significant for lithium extraction from aqueous solutions with very low lithium content...|$|R
