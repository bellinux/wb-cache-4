40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} {{accuracy}} of electrocardiography in screening for left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertension. DESIGN: Systematic review of studies of test accuracy of six electrocardiographic indexes: the Sokolow-Lyon index, Cornell voltage index, Cornell product index, Gubner index, and Romhilt-Estes scores with thresholds for a positive test of > or = 4 points or > or = 5 points. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases ((Pre-) Medline, Embase), reference lists of relevant studies and previous reviews, and experts. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers scrutinised abstracts and examined potentially eligible studies. Studies comparing the <b>electrocardiographic</b> <b>index</b> with echocardiography in hypertensive patients and reporting sufficient data were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Data on study populations, echocardiographic criteria, and methodological quality of studies were extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: Negative likelihood ratios, which indicate {{to what extent the}} posterior odds of left ventricular hypertrophy is reduced by a negative test, were calculated. RESULTS: 21 studies and data on 5608 patients were analysed. The median prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy was 33 % (interquartile range 23 - 41 %) in primary care settings (10 studies) and 65 % (37 - 81 %) in secondary care settings (11 studies). The median negative likelihood ratio was similar across <b>electrocardiographic</b> <b>indexes,</b> ranging from 0. 85 (range 0. 34 - 1. 03) for the Romhilt-Estes score (with threshold > or = 4 points) to 0. 91 (0. 70 - 1. 01) for the Gubner index. Using the Romhilt-Estes score in primary care, a negative electrocardiogram result would reduce the typical pre-test probability from 33 % to 31 %. In secondary care the typical pre-test probability of 65 % would be reduced to 63 %. CONCLUSION: Electrocardiographic criteria should not be used to rule out left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with hypertension...|$|R
40|$|The {{transcriptional}} regulation orchestrating {{the development}} of the heart is increasingly recognized to play an essential role in the regulation of ion channel and gap junction gene expression and consequently the proper generation and conduction of the cardiac electrical impulse. This has led to the realization that in some instances, abnormal cardiac electrical function and arrhythmias in the postnatal heart may stem from a developmental abnormality causing maintained (epigenetic) changes in gene regulation. The role of developmental genes in the regulation of cardiac electrical function is further underscored by recent genome-wide association studies that provide strong evidence that common genetic variation, at loci harbouring these genes, modulates <b>electrocardiographic</b> <b>indices</b> of conduction and repolarization and susceptibility to arrhythmia.

Methods Baseline characteristics of 246 consecutive patients (236 men; mean age, 47. 6 +/- 13. 6 years) with a Brugada-type electrocardiogram, including 13 patients with a history of VF and 40 patients with a history of syncope episodes, were retrospectively analyzed. During the mean follow-up period of 45. 1 months, VF in 23 patients and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in 1 patient were observed. Clinical/ genetic and electrocardiographic parameters were compared with VF/SCD events. Results On univariate analysis, a history of VF and syncope episodes, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, spontaneous type 1 pattern in the precordial leads, and electrocardiographic markers of depolarization abnormalities (QRS duration >= 120 ms, and fragmented QRS [f-QRS]) and those of repolarization abnormalities (inferolateral early repolarization [ER] pattern and QT prolongation) were associated with later cardiac events. On multivariable analysis, a history of VF and syncope episodes, inferolateral ER pattern, and f-QRS were independent predictors of documented VF and SCD (odds ratios: 19. 61, 28. 57, 2. 87, and 5. 21, respectively; p < 0. 05).

T and QRS-duration in lambs were significantly lower than adult Chios ewes. The electrocardiographic amplitudes in lambs were lower than ewes, non-significantly.

The proportion of sinus arrhythmia and sinus tachycardia in lambs was significantly more than ewes. Sino-atrial block was also detected in lambs.

40|$|Nine lead electrocardiograms of non-infarcted (N = 61) and infarcted (N = 71) female Wistar rats (200 - 250 g) were {{analyzed}} {{in order to}} distinguish left ventricle myocardial infarction (MI) larger than 40 % (LMI) from MI smaller than 40 % (SMI). MI larger than 40 % clearly caused a deviation of ÂQRS and ÂT from normal values of 270 - 360 degrees to 90 - 270 degrees. Infarcted rats showed Q wave in D 1 larger than 1 mm with 94 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} effect of {{pulmonary}} valve replacement (PVR) on the repolarization of patients with tetralogy of Fallot. Background: Pulmonary valve regurgitation may cause right ventricular failure in adult patients with Fallot's tetralogy. In these patients, prolonged depolarization and disturbed repolarization are associated with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Methods: Thirty Fallot patients (age 32 9 years, 19 male) eligible for PVR were studied with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) before and 6 months after PVR. Electrocardiograms obtained during initial and follow-up CMR were analyzed and occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias was studied. Results: Right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RV EDV) decreased from 322 87 to 215 +/- 57 ml after PVR (P 160 ms. No severe ventricular arrhythmias were found in patients with a RV EDV < 220 ml, QRS-T angle < 100 degrees, QT dispersion < 60 ins or T-wave complexity < 0. 30. Conclusion: Normal repolarization indices {{may be associated with}} the absence of severe ventricular arrhythmias.
