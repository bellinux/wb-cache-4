500|$|Despite her {{recollections}} of a pleasant early childhood, Hügel-Marshall was {{singled out for}} her skin colour. Growing up, she faced constant racism and was referred to by the local community as a Negermischling; Mischling was the term used by the Nazis to designate [...] "mixed" [...] children (with a Jewish and a non-Jewish parent). In 1952, when {{she was ready to}} start school, her mother was forced by social services to send her to the orphanage God's Little Cabin Children's Home. She lived there {{for the rest of her}} childhood, despite promises that it was only temporary, that she would only be there for six weeks. At the home, she endured mental and physical abuse from both adults and children. This included being shouted at to stop crying for her mother, being force-fed her own vomit, and undergoing an exorcism, during which she was blindfolded and forced to repeat such phrases as [...] "Satan, I cast you out" [...] and [...] "Lord Jesus, purify my black soul."

2500|$|One {{piece of}} {{evidence}} supporting the possibility of Sacco's guilt arose in 1941 when anarchist leader Carlo Tresca, {{a member of the}} Sacco and Vanzetti Defense Committee, told Max Eastman, [...] "Sacco was guilty but Vanzetti was innocent." [...] Eastman published an article recounting his conversation with Tresca in National Review in 1961. Later, others would confirm being told the same information by Tresca, but Tresca's daughter insisted <b>she</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> him.

2500|$|One {{person he}} valued was his sister-in-law, now widowed by the war. She {{had a child}} in a war time affair. <b>She</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> Richard of the child, aware of his Victorian views, telling others she has a nephew she helps. She is {{grateful}} for his kindness in including her in his will, as she can now raise her son on faraway Cyprus with a proper education. The child is loved, but his mother feels he cannot be accepted in post war England. The last name chosen for Cora's husband, the much disliked painter with some claim to being French, is Lansquenet.
