An intense three-way competition for NASA funds {{to construct a}} large telescope began between Kuiper, Harvard University, and the University of Hawaii (UH), which only had experience in solar astronomy. This culminated in funds being awarded to the [...] "upstart" [...] UH proposal. UH rebuilt its small astronomy department into a new Institute for Astronomy, and in 1968 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources gave it a 65-year lease for all land within a [...] radius of its telescope, essentially that above [...] On its completion in 1970, the UH [...] was the seventh largest optical/infrared telescope in the world.|$|E

2500|$|The bridge has {{a single}} span of {{approximately}} [...] and was revolutionary for its time, in that it used an extremely slender arch which was not possible using traditional masonry construction. The ironwork was cast at the Plas Kynaston iron foundry at Cefn Mawr, near Ruabon in Denbighshire by William Hazledine, who cast a number of Telford bridges. The ironwork was transported from the foundry through the Ellesmere Canal and Pontcysyllte Aqueduct then by sea to Speymouth, where it was loaded onto wagons and taken to the <b>site.</b> <b>Testing</b> in the 1960s revealed that the cast-iron had an unusually high tensile strength. This was probably specified by Telford because, unlike in traditional masonry arch bridges, some sections of the arch are not in compression under loading.|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{differentiate}} an allergic patch test response from an irritant response, we evaluated by flow cytometry the percentages of various epidermal cell populations isolated from allergen and irritant-treated patch <b>test</b> <b>sites.</b> Nine allergic individuals were patch tested with various allergens (Rhus, dinitrochlorobenzene [DNCB], or nickel chloride) and a vehicle control for 48 h. Eight additional individuals were patch tested with irritating chemicals (sodium lauryl sulfate or nonanoic acid) and with a vehicle control for 48 h. Epidermal cells, isolated from suction blisters, were double labeled for CD 1 /HLA-DR, CD 3 /HLA-DR, or CD 36 /HLA-DR cell surface markers and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the percentage of various cell populations. A mean increase of 0. 91 ± 0. 3 {{in the percentage of}} DR+CD 1 + Langerhans cells over the vehicle control patch <b>test</b> <b>site</b> was detected in allergen-positive patch <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> in allergic individuals, whereas a decrease of 0. 19 ± 0. 2 in the percentage of DR+CD 1 + Langerhans cells from the vehicle control patch <b>test</b> <b>site</b> was detected in irritant-treated patch <b>test</b> <b>sites.</b> Epidermal cells from allergen-positive patch <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> also exhibited an increase of 5. 2 ± 1. 8 in percentage of DR+CD 1 - cells over the vehicle control patch <b>test</b> <b>site</b> compared to an increase change of 0. 8 ± 0. 4 in epidermal cells isolated from irritant-treated patch <b>test</b> <b>sites.</b> We also found that DR+ cells that lacked the CD 1 determinant expressed the macrophage/monocyte antigen CD 36 (OKM 5). Finally, a 2. 3 ± 0. 8 increase in the percentage of DR-CD 3 + cells over the vehicle control patch <b>test</b> <b>site</b> was observed in allergen-positive patch <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> compared to an increase of 0. 2 ± 0. 2 observed in irritant- treated patch <b>test</b> <b>sites.</b> These results demonstrate a significant increase in DR+CD 1 +, DR+CD 1 -CD 36 +, and DR-CD 3 + epidermal cells in allergen-positive patch <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> compared to irritant patch <b>test</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R

Though normally {{thought of as a}} predominantly auditory structure, recent work has uncovered a variety of non-auditory influences on firing rate in the IC.

Visual/visuomotor associated activity was found throughout the IC (overall, 84 of 199 <b>sites</b> <b>tested</b> or 42 %), but with a far reduced prevalence and strength along recording penetrations passing through the tonotopically organized region of the IC, putatively the central nucleus (11 of 42 <b>sites</b> <b>tested,</b> or 26 %).
