40|$|Abstract. We {{report a}} patient {{presenting}} with chronic diarrhoea of unidentified etiology. Laboratory results showed microcytic anemia, peripheral eosinophilia with negative results of stool sample smears and stool concentration technique. Ancylostoma duodenale {{was found in}} the caecum and terminal ileum during colonoscopy. The patient was treated with a 3 -day course of 400 mg albendazole and iron supplement. The diarrhoea disappeared shortly after treatment. Physicians particularly in tropical areas should be aware of hookworms as causative agents of chronic diarrhoea and it may be found in the large intestine. CASE HISTORY A 44 -year-old Thai woman presented with chronic watery diarrhoea and weight loss for two months. She is a housewife and lives in <b>Samutprakarn</b> <b>province,</b> central region of Thailand. She was diagnosed with meningioma and treated b...|$|E
40|$|We {{undertook}} {{a study of}} the mechanical transmission of parasitic organisms in cockroaches in the <b>Samutprakarn</b> <b>province</b> of Thailand. In this study, 920 cockroaches were obtained from 18 open-air shopping markets in 5 districts and 1 subdistrict of this province. All cockroaches were captured during their feeding time in their natural habitat. Direct wet smear and modified acid-fast bacilli staining were used to identify the parasites from the external surface or cuticle of the cockroaches. The results show that 498 (54. 1 %) of the cockroaches harbored parasitic organisms. Of these, 56. 1 % were protozoa and the remaining 43. 9 % were helminthes (pathogenic helminthes- 1. 4 %, non-pathogenic helminthes- 42. 5 %). Of the pathogenic helminthes, the species included Strongyloides stercoralis (6 instances of the free-living adult male, 0. 8 %), Ascaris lumbricoides (2 decorticated eggs, 0. 3 %), Trichuris trichiura (2, 0. 3 %), and Taenia spp. (1 egg, 0. 1 %). The protozoa types that were identified included Cyclospora spp. (10 oocysts, 1. 3 %), Endolimax nana (10 cysts, 1. 3 %), B. hominis (9 instances of the vacuolated form, 1. 2 %), Isospora belli (75 oocysts, 9. 6 %), Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar (36 cysts, 4. 6 %), Cryptosporidium spp. (220 oocysts, 28. 1 %), Chilomastix mesnilli (2 cysts, 0. 3 %), Entamoeba coli (31 cysts, 4. 0 %), Balantidium coli (45 trophozoites, 5. 8 %), and Iodamoeba butschlii (1 cyst, 0. 1 %). These results show that cockroaches isolated from these markets are carriers of several parasitic organisms that cause commonly found symptoms of illness such as diarrhea or bowel disorder...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the linkages and factors influencing relationships between universities and companies in Thailand’s automotive cluster and seeks applicable models {{and ways to}} improve the linkages among government, universities, national research institutions and firms in order to enhance innovation and competitiveness in the industry. Based on the ideas of the knowledge economy and a “triple helix model” of relationships among government-industry-university, this study uses multiple data collection methods, including questionnaires and in-depth interviews, with descriptive analysis to investigate the relationship among government, university and industry in Thailand’s automotive cluster in <b>Samutprakarn</b> <b>province</b> which emerged in 1990 s to become a leading industrial sector of the country that the government has emphasized on. Findings from this research show universities, as important players in the knowledgebased cluster, have three major schemes to serve the cluster, in collaboration with government, organization/institute and industry. Those are 1) to produce graduates highly relevant to the need of related sectors and 2) to conduct basic and applied research, and 3) to collaborate with organization/institute and industry to create new technology/innovations. However, there are challenges for any university to substantially support the cluster. These challenges are 1) universities do not produce highly qualified and industrially relevant graduates, 2) universities do not understand and accommodate the nature of industry, 3) universities do not have sufficient resources, 4) universities are not recognized as a critical player in economy, and 5) universities do not seriously cooperate among themselves and with other related sectors. To deal with the challenges above and to enhance universities’ competitiveness/ relevance in the automotive industry, my study recommends that universities could be improved by establishing a track record, culture and strategic plan to enhance trust and mutual recognition from the Thai automotive cluster. It is this trust and recognition that could lead to collaboration and eventually transform the automotive cluster into a knowledge-based and competitive cluster. In the longer-term, universities that adopt a mission to serve industry should be developed to become an effective component of the ‘triple helix’ or an entrepreneurial university by 1) committing themselves towards collaboration with industry and other players for mutual benefit and industrial growth, 2) understanding the demands and culture of industry, 3) developing niche technology and translating this into patents/licensing, 4) providing consultancy and collaborating with industry and government through an entrepreneurial spirit, 5) supporting business incubation services and spin-offs, 6) enhancing continuity of cooperative and entrepreneurship education, 7) recruiting and developing industrially-experienced and research-active staff, and 8) accommodating competitive facilities for R&D. In addition, a governmental intermediate organization (such as Thailand Automotive Institute) should be identified as the central organization in improving competitiveness of the cluster that should be given greater autonomy and flexibility to support the coopetition of different players with greater efficiency and effectiveness.
