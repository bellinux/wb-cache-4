Such <b>solvates</b> are useful materials as electron acceptors for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. We found that the fullerene parts contained in the <b>solvates</b> are unstable without solvents, and the interactions between fullerene and solvent molecules in C 60 and PCBM <b>solvates</b> have a significant contribution to the cohesive energies of <b>solvates,</b> indicating that solvent molecules are essential to keep C 60 and PCBM <b>solvates</b> stable. Both the band gap (Eg) and the HOMO, LUMO states of C 60 and PCBM <b>solvates</b> are mainly determined by the fullerene parts contained in <b>solvates.</b> Chlorobenzene- and orthodichlorobenzene-solvated PCBM are the most promising electron-accepting materials among these <b>solvates</b> to increase the driving force for charge separation in OPVs due to their relatively high LUMO energies.

Changes in the absorption spectra of C 60 <b>solvates</b> relative to the solvent-free C 60 crystal are more significant than those of PCBM <b>solvates</b> due to the weaker effect of solvents on the ?-stacking interactions between fullerene molecules in the latter <b>solvates.</b> The main absorptions for all C 60 and PCBM crystals locate in the ultraviolet (UV) regio...|$|R
50|$|In a {{cosolvent}} system, two miscible fluids {{with different}} boiling points are mixed {{to create a}} zeotropic mixture. The first fluid is a <b>solvating</b> agent that dissolves soil in the cleaning process.

2500|$|It {{may seem}} {{counterintuitive}} that a channel should allow potassium ions {{but not the}} smaller sodium ions through. However in an aqueous environment, potassium and sodium cations are solvated by water molecules.

The diameter of the selectivity filter is ideal for the potassium cation, but {{too big for the}} smaller sodium cation. Hence the potassium cations are well [...] "solvated" [...] by the protein carbonyl groups, but these same carbonyl groups are too far apart to adequately <b>solvate</b> the sodium cation.
