5|$|In the semi-finals Cardiff {{were drawn}} against Reading; the match was played at Molineux Stadium. Reading {{had reached the}} semi-final {{for the first time}} in their history. Additional trains were put on to bring Cardiff fans to Wolverhampton for the match, and there was an {{expectation}} that the game would set a new capacity record for the ground. Heavy rain had fallen before the match, resulting in a <b>soft</b> <b>pitch.</b> Reading appeared the stronger of the two teams at the start, but at 25 minutes Bert Eggo failed to clear the ball from the Reading penalty area and Ferguson pounced, scoring for Cardiff. This changed the match, which from then on was dominated by the Welsh. A further goal followed in the 35th minute from Harry Wake, sending Cardiff into half time two goals ahead. Reading pressed on initially during the second half, but Cardiff gradually regained domination of play, and Ferguson scored his second of the game in the 70th minute. Cardiff's fans began to celebrate early, believing that Reading could not come back from three goals down, which was the final result of the game.|$|E

25|$|In 1951, Wardle was {{unsuccessful}} in challenging Jim Laker and Roy Tattersall for a Test spin bowling place. However, with Bob Appleyard hit by illness, Wardle's workrate reached such {{levels in the}} following two seasons that his total of 20,723 balls delivered in these two seasons, has been beaten only by Tich Freeman, and his 11,084 balls in 1952, is the fourth-highest aggregate ever delivered. During August 1952, Wardle sent down 165 overs in two consecutive games. Though Yorkshire had a decline in fortunes in 1953, Wardle took 4 for 7 on a <b>soft</b> <b>pitch</b> at Old Trafford, and he was {{named one of the}} Wisden Cricketers of the Year, and he toured the West Indies again. The competition from Laker and Lock, though, gave him little chance to distinguish himself, although in two innings of 39 and 66, he showed the virtue in hitting against Ramadhin and Valentine. The latter innings were of real consequence as Wardle, batting with Len Hutton, put on 105 for the seventh wicket which heralded a series-saving victory for England.|$|E
25|$|After the Tigers had {{clinched}} the 1968 American League pennant, McLain {{added to his}} penchant for notoriety while pitching his 31st and final regular season victory {{in a game against}} the Yankees on September 19. McLain had grown up idolizing New York Yankee center fielder Mickey Mantle, who entered the game tied with Jimmie Foxx for third place in the major-league career home runs list. When Mantle—who was nine days away from his last major league appearance—came to bat in the eighth inning with the Tigers holding a 6-1 lead, McLain intentionally threw a <b>soft</b> <b>pitch</b> directly over home plate. Other accounts said that he called catcher Jim Price to the mound and had him tell Mantle that he would be throwing only fastballs. Mantle hit the pitch for his 535th career home run, putting him in sole possession of third place on the all-time home run list, behind only Babe Ruth and Willie Mays. As Mantle ran around the bases, McLain stood on the pitcher's mound and applauded. Mantle tipped his hat to McLain as he rounded the bases. The next batter, Joe Pepitone, waved his bat over the plate, as if asking for an easy pitch of his own. McLain responded by throwing the next pitch over Pepitone's head. After the game, McLain smilingly denied that he had served up an easy pitch for Mantle to hit; however, he was later reprimanded by Major League Baseball Commissioner William Eckert.|$|E
25|$|Fred Trueman {{opened the}} bowling and soon had Bill Lawry writhing {{as he made}} the ball lift off the rain-freshed wicket, but it was Brian Statham who struck first. He had Bobby Simpson out first ball, caught behind by wicket-keeper Alan Smith for a first ball duck to match Alec Bedser's record of 236 Test wickets. Ted Dexter crowded close fielders round the batsmen as Trueman and Statham {{continued}} their attack, but he noticed that their footmarks were indenting the <b>soft</b> <b>pitch</b> and after 45 minutes he replaced Trueman with Ray Illingworth and Statham with Fred Titmus. They failed to turn the ball, it wouldn't turn throughout the match, but the Yorkshireman almost had 3 wickets for 1 run. Lawry was bowled for 10, Illingworth (1/85) coming round the wicket with a straight ball to remove his off-stump. Neil Harvey had just made 231 not out against South Australia, his last innings in the Sheffield Shield, and was full of confidence. On 11 he snicked the ball to slip where Colin Cowdrey dropped a sharp chance and swung the following ball was to square-leg, where David Sheppard dropped an easy chance. On 26 he gave Cowdrey another chance in the slips, the waist-high ball dropped {{with his left hand}} off Dexter. Cowdrey finally took a catch to remove Brian Booth (34) off Titmus (2/88) after lunch for 101/3, but England failed to dismiss the out of form Norm O'Neill when he pushed a ball from Titmus close to Dexter's left hand at square-leg. Having survived Harvey and O'Neill set about the English bowling in the most attractive batting of the entire series. They added 194 for the fourth-wicket in 171 minutes and at five runs an over. O'Neill swept Titmus to the boundary, followed by two drives to either side of the wicket, and more from cuts through gully and point. Harvey danced down the wicket to hit Titmus for four three times in an over, and became the fourth batsman to pass 6,000 Test runs after Wally Hammond, Don Bradman and Len Hutton. He drove Illingworth through the covers in the last over before tea to bring up his 21st Test century, his 6th against England. But Dexter kept the suffering spinners on until the new ball arrived after tea. Trueman and Statham were exhausted and made no impression with the new ball, so Dexter bowled himself with Illingworth chipping in with medium-paced seamers from his youth. At {{the end of the day}} the tired batsmen gave themselves out to the tired fieldsmen, O'Neill reached his century in 169 minutes, the fastest of the series, with 14 boundaries, but was caught for 100 by Cowdrey off Dexter (3/94). Harvey cut the ball to Cowdrey off the England captain for 154 with 18 boundaries to leave Australia 302/5. Alan Davidson and Barry Shepherd took them to 322/5 overnight, but the England bowlers recovered in the morning and Australia crashed to 393 all out, losing their last 5 wickets for 71 runs. Brian Statham (3/66) had Shepherd caught in the gully by Trueman for his record 237th wicket to become the biggest wicket-taker in Test cricket. Trueman (1/54) had Ken Mackay caught behind by an agile Smith, Richie Benaud was bowled by Dexter, Davidson (46) was bowled by Statham and the unsafe hands of David Sheppard held onto a long, high skier from Garth McKenzie in the deep.|$|E
5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the <b>softer</b> <b>pitches</b> of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|R
50|$|In 1903, despite {{numerous}} <b>soft</b> <b>pitches,</b> Wass {{was less}} effective taking 76 wickets, {{though this was}} frequently attributed to the extreme placidity of the Trent Bridge pitches in fine weather. Still, in 1904, though overworked in unfavourable conditions, Wass appeared for the Players at Kennington Oval, which was to remain {{one of only two}} appearances he ever made in a representative match.

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were known}} for their poor pitch handling characteristics. The famous aerodynamicist Irv Culver told Albatross owner Jeff Byard that the problem came from three sources. First, the rotation axis of the all flying horizontal tail was located at 35% chord instead of slightly {{in front of the}} aerodynamic center at 25% chord. [...] Second, the horizontal tail rotation hinge had high friction. Third, the relatively <b>soft</b> <b>pitch</b> axis cable control system stored elastic energy reacting the friction in the tail hinge. As the pilot tried to input pitch controls into the unstable tail, the friction of the tailplane hinge prevented initial movement which then stored up energy in the control cables. The pilot then applied more force to get the desired reaction. Eventually, the high friction would break loose and the horizontal tail would move much farther than desired due to the higher than necessary force applied by the pilot and releasing the force in the control cables. The resulting over control often resulting in PIO and when near the ground would likely damage the aircraft. [...] Culver instructed the owner to move the hinge axis forward to 24.5%, add a downspring to the pitch control, and liberally lubricate the hinge axis before each flight to reduce friction. According to Byard, the plane flies significantly better with the improvements.|$|E
50|$|In 1902, Taylor batted so well on a {{succession}} of difficult pitches that he scored 1,567 runs, including a century for the Gentlemen at Scarborough, and superb innings against Derbyshire and Leicestershire on <b>soft</b> <b>pitches.</b> He was Yorkshire's leading batsman that season, and {{it came as a}} shock when, after brief tours of Australia and New Zealand that winter, Taylor stayed in Japan during 1903. Yorkshire's batting in that summer really showed what Taylor meant to them on <b>soft</b> or treacherous <b>pitches,</b> and, when he returned to England in 1904, he devoted so much time to his engineering business that he could never spare any time for three-day cricket apart from July and August 1906. His lack of practice clearly showed in thirteen matches played in those months: his average was a modest 21.00 and he only twice reached fifty. Yet, there is little doubt Taylor would still have been of value to Yorkshire could he have spared some time for cricket, especially in wet summers.|$|R

2500|$|Townsend first {{emerged as}} a leg break bowler from Clifton College {{at the age of}} 16 in 1893. He took 21 wickets in four games and showed, despite his very slight build, the ability to get through a lot of bowling and spin the ball prodigiously from leg. In one innings against Middlesex, he bowled 70 five-ball overs (equivalent to 58 six-ball overs). [...] In that season, his county's wicket-keeper, William Brain, {{completed}} the only instance in first-class cricket of a hat-trick of stumpings, taken off Townsend's bowling. The following year, Townsend’s record was modest though Grace gave him a good deal of bowling on <b>soft</b> <b>pitches,</b> and he was seen as not physically strong enough for county cricket by most critics of the day.|$|R
2500|$|Amiss and Lloyd lasted the few balls left on {{the first}} day and a couple of byes gave the 2/0. On the third day Lillee for once looked better than Thomson, who was working hard digging the ball into the <b>soft</b> <b>pitch.</b> Throughout the series Lillee had {{peppered}} batsmen with bouncers, but on this occasion he had Amiss caught by Ian Chappell off the third ball of the day, bowled at medium-fast pace and well up. Encouraged by this the Western Australian bowled with much greater skill and even when he crowded Cowdrey with off and leg side slips in Bodyline fashion he kept the ball up and was rewarded with 4/49, his best figures of the series. Lloyd was playing so far back that he was in danger of stepping on his stumps, but ended when he glanced Lillee straight behind to Marsh with England 19/2. The River Torrens Stand a banner [...] "Denness' Last Stand" [...] and a trumpeter in the crowd played the Last Post when the England captain came to the wicket. Buoyed by his recent innings against Tasmania and NSW he struck 51 off 66 balls with 7 fours, using the square cut with effect. At noon the concentration of the batsmen was disturbed by the 21 gun salute from the barracks behind the Victor Richardson Stand, which held up play for five minutes. When play resumed Cowdrey was dismissed off a Thomson bouncer that swung in and flied off his bat high above Walker's head, only for the 6'4" [...] Victorian to leap up Aussie Rules style to take an 'impossible' catch. Thomson (3/58) also accounted for Denness a few minutes before lunch when an attempted cut went to Marsh, having made most of England's 90/4. Thus the Queenslander set a new Australian record for the most wickets in a series by a fast bowler, beating Lillee's 31 in the 1972 Ashes series. Terry Jenner's leg-spin was brought in after lunch, but Keith Fletcher hit him for 12 runs off one over and he was replaced by Ashley Mallett's off-spin. At the other end Tony Greig became Lillee's third victim when he slashed a ball behind for Marsh's third catch of the day at 130/5. The last five wickets fell in a daze as first Fletcher tried to cut Thomson two feet off the off-stump and was caught by Ian Chappell and Knott, Titmus and Underwood gave Mallett figures of 3/14 by trying to sweep him out of the ground, giving two catches to Lillee in the deep and Greg Chappell a record 14 catches by a fielder in a Test series. Lillee bowled Arnold for a duck and England few from 155/5 to 172 all out, a deficit of 132 runs. It was a poor performance, the tourists were dismissed on a flat wicket inside two sessions and threw away the rain-given chance of winning a Test that was handed to them with the toss of a coin on the second day.|$|E

40|$|A {{stability}} test program {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of airspeed, collective pitch, rotor speed and shaft angle on stability and loads at speeds beyond that attained in the BMR/BO- 105 flight test program.

Two configuration variations were tested for their effect on stability. One variable was the control system stiffness. An axially <b>softer</b> <b>pitch</b> link was installed in place of the standard BO- 105 pitch link. The second variation was the addition of elastomeric damper strips to increase the structural damping. The BMR was stable at all conditions tested.

Analytical predictions are in good agreement with test data up to 90 knots, but the trend of decreasing damping above 90 knots is contrary to the theory...|$|R
