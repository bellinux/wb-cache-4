2500|$|Rover {{acknowledged}} the emerging recreational off-road market in 1967 under Charles Spencer King, {{and began the}} [...] "100-inch Station Wagon" [...] program to develop a radical competitor. Rover bought a Bronco, which featured the sort of long-travel coil spring suspension necessary for the required blend of luxury car comfort and Land Rover's proven off-road ability. [...] King {{is said to have}} been convinced of coil springs while driving a Rover P6 across rough scrubland on part of the Solihull factory site that was being redeveloped. [...] He was also convinced that a permanent four-wheel drive transmission was needed both to provide adequate handling and reliably absorb the power required for the vehicle to be competitive. The cost of developing a totally new transmission was spread between the 100-inch SW project and one working on what would become the Land Rover 101 Forward Control. Powerful, light and sturdy, the Buick alloy V8 earned off-road modifications such as carburetors that maintained fuel supply at extreme angles and provision for cranking the engine with a <b>starting</b> <b>handle</b> in emergencies.|$|E
60|$|They were on {{the point}} of starting, the chauffeur with his hand upon the <b>starting</b> <b>handle,</b> French with the {{steering}} wheel of the police car already in his hand. And then the little party seemed suddenly turned to stone. For a few breathless seconds not one of them moved. Out into the clammy night air came the echoes of a hideous, inhuman, blood-curdling scream. Quest was the first to recover himself. He leaped from his seat and rushed back across the empty hall into the study, followed a little way behind by French and the others. An unsuspected panel door which led into the garden, stood slightly ajar. The Professor, with his hand {{on the back of a}} chair, was staring at the fireplace, shaking as though with some horrible ague, his face distorted, his body curiously hunched-up. He seemed suddenly to have dropped his humanity, to have fallen back into the world of some strange creatures. He heard their footsteps, but he did not turn his head. His hands were stretched out in front of him as though to keep away from his sight some hateful object.|$|E

60|$|The {{two gentlemen}} resumed their seats. The car started {{and then by}} an unfortunate inadvertency Sir Richmond pulled the gear lever over from the first speed to the reverse. There was a {{metallic}} clangour beneath the two gentlemen, and the car slowed down and stopped although the engine was still throbbing wildly, and the dainty veil of blue smoke still streamed forward {{from the back of}} the car before a gentle breeze. The doctor got out almost precipitately, followed by a gaunt madman, mouthing vileness, who had only a minute or so before been a decent British citizen. He made some blind lunges at the tremulous but obdurate car, but rather as if he looked for offences and accusations than for displacements to adjust. Quivering and refusing, the little car was extraordinarily like some recalcitrant little old aristocratic lady in the hands of revolutionaries, and this made the behaviour of Sir Richmond seem even more outrageous than it would otherwise have done. He stopped the engine, he went down on his hands and knees in the road to peer up at the gear-box, then without restoring the spark, he tried to wind up the engine again. He spun the little handle with an insane violence, faster and faster for--as it seemed to the doctor--the better part of a minute. Beads of perspiration appeared upon his brow and ran together; he bared his teeth in a snarl; his hat slipped over one eye. He groaned with rage. Then, using the <b>starting</b> <b>handle</b> as a club, he assailed the car. He smote the brazen Mercury from its foothold and sent it and a part of the radiator cap with it flying across the road. He beat at the wings of the bonnet, until they bent in under his blows. Finally, he hurled the starting-handle at the wind-screen and smashed it. The starting-handle rattled over the bonnet and fell to the ground....|$|E
5000|$|From {{the outside}} the 402 Légère was {{initially}} virtually {{indistinguishable from the}} 302. [...] However, on the front grille, whereas on the 302 the hole for the <b>starting</b> <b>handle</b> corresponded with the central digit in the car’s name spelled out on bottom part of the front grille, on the 402 Légère {{it was necessary to}} position the hole for the <b>starting</b> <b>handle</b> below the “402” name badge because the engine itself was positioned very slightly higher. [...] An improvement over the 302 available to the driver, albeit only at extra cost, was the option of a Cotal pre-selector transmission, which could be controlled using a selector lever positioned directly behind the steering wheel, so that the driver needed to move his/her hand only minimally in order to change gear.|$|E

50|$|Known as the Zhiguli {{within the}} Soviet Union, the main {{differences}} between the VAZ-2103 and the Fiat 124 Special are the use of thicker-gauge steel for the bodyshell (so the 2103 weighed 1030 kg, the Fiat 105 kg less), an overhead camshaft engine (in place of the original Fiat OHV unit), {{and the use of}} aluminium drum brakes on the rear wheels in place of disc brakes. The car featured a <b>starting</b> <b>handle</b> for cranking the engine manually should the battery go flat in Siberian winter conditions and an auxiliary fuel pump. It also included a clock and improved soundproofing.|$|E
50|$|The <b>starting</b> <b>handle</b> {{passes through}} a water tank {{at the front of}} the car. The {{radiator}} is fixed immediately above this tank. Its sides are of ribbed aluminium castings connected by finned tubes run horizontally across the front of the car. The ribbed aluminium castings inspired Daimler's flutes. The water circulating centrifugal pump is driven by a friction wheel pressing against the flywheel. Two pressure lubricators feed the pump's bearings. The design ensures natural circulation would continue if the pump were out of order. There is a sheet metal casing beneath the engine as a dust-shield.|$|E

5000|$|The {{specification}} {{of the car}} was basic. The steel dish wheels were of a thinness commonly associated with basic motorcycles and needed therefore to be pumped to a relatively high pressure. [...] The hardness of the tires and the minimalist approach taken to shock absorption made the cars strikingly uncomfortable. Except for users of cabriolet versions with the roof open, above average agility was vital for anyone wishing to get {{in or out of}} a Champion. [...] Driver fitness was also encouraged by the need to start the engine with a <b>starting</b> <b>handle,</b> there being no electric starter-motor.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine is}} then turned {{over with a}} <b>{{starting}}</b> <b>handle</b> placed in the starting dog on the flywheel. This is aided by the decompression valve, which decompresses the engine and {{makes it easier to}} turn over to allow the flywheel to gain speed and inertia to turn the engine through compression, and get the engine to fire. A spiral groove on the perimeter of the flywheel carries a wheel on the decompressor mechanism and is used to determine the number of revolutions before the decompressor disengages. This is generally up to 3 revolutions, but can be anything up to 6 revolutions. Depending on the condition and mood of individual tractors, it is possible to get a thorough workout starting the Marshall.|$|E
50|$|The {{lightweight}} Italian Fiat 124, {{which had}} won the 1967 European Car of the Year, was adapted {{in order to survive}} treacherous Russian driving conditions. Among many changes, aluminium brake drums were added to the rear, and the original Fiat engine was dropped in favour of a newer design made by NAMI. This new engine had a modern overhead camshaft design but was never used in Fiat cars. The suspension was raised to clear rough Russian roads and the bodyshell was made from thicker, heavier steel. The first Lada models were equipped with a <b>starting</b> <b>handle</b> in case the battery went flat in Siberian conditions, though this was later dropped. Another feature specifically intended to help out in cold conditions was a manual auxiliary fuel pump.|$|E

25|$|Cranks were {{formerly}} {{common on}} some {{machines in the}} early 20th century; for example almost all phonographs before the 1930s were powered by clockwork motors wound with cranks. Reciprocating piston engines use cranks to convert the linear piston motion into rotational motion. Internal combustion engines of early 20th century automobiles were usually started with hand cranks (known as <b>starting</b> <b>handles</b> in the UK), before electric starters came into general use.|$|R
50|$|The 2101 is a {{re-engineered}} {{version of}} the Fiat 124 produced under licence from Fiat and tailored for {{the nations of the}} Eastern Bloc, but was widely exported to the West as an economy car. Although the facelifted and modernised VAZ-2105, 2104 & 2107 versions largely replaced it in the West in the early 1980s, it was still produced for the domestic market as late as 1988. Known as the Zhiguli (for the hills found near the plant) within the Soviet Union, the main differences between the VAZ-2101 and the Fiat 124 are the use of thicker gauge steel for the bodyshell, drum brakes on the rear wheels in place of disc brakes, and a bespoke engine. Early versions of the car featured a <b>starting</b> <b>handle</b> for cranking the engine manually should the battery go flat in Siberian winter conditions, and an auxiliary fuel pump.|$|E

5000|$|Steering was difficult, {{controlled}} by varying {{the speed of}} the two tracks. Four of the crew, two drivers (one of whom also acted as commander; he operated the brakes, the other the primary gearbox) and two [...] "gearsmen" [...] (one for the secondary gears of each track) were needed to control direction and speed, the latter never more than a walking pace. As the noise inside was deafening, the driver, after setting the primary gear box, communicated with the gearsmen with hand signals, first getting their attention by hitting the engine block with a heavy spanner. For slight turns, the driver could use the steering tail: an enormous contraption dragged behind the tank consisting of two large wheels, each of which could be blocked by pulling a steel cable causing the whole vehicle to slide in the same direction. If the engine stalled, the gearsmen would use the <b>starting</b> <b>handle</b> - a large crank between the engine and the gearbox. Many of these vehicles broke down in the heat of battle making them an easy target for German gunners. There was no wireless (radio); communication with command posts was by means of two pigeons, which had their own small exit hatch in the sponsons, or by runners. Because of the noise and vibration, early experiments had shown that radios were impractical, therefore lamps, flags, semaphore, coloured discs, and the carrier pigeons were part of the standard equipment of the various marks.|$|E

No water pump, {{engine cooling}} by thermosyphon - {{this was very}} basic motoring.When production of the older Ford Anglia and Ford Prefect was stopped in 1953 the Popular was developed as a budget alternative, based on the old, pre-war style E494A Anglia. The E494A was, in turn, a facelift of the Anglia E04A, which was a facelifted version of the 7Y, itself a rebodied Model Y. Thus through several adjustments, updates and name changes, a design with provenance dating back to 1932 was produced by Ford for 27 years. It was powered by a Ford Sidevalve 1172 cc, , four-cylinder engine. The car was very basic. It had a single vacuum-powered wiper, no heater, vinyl trim, and very little chrome; even the bumpers were painted, and the bakelite dash of the Anglia {{was replaced by a}} flat steel panel. The Popular 103E differed visually from the Anglia E494E in having smaller headlights and a lack of trim {{on the side of the}} bonnet. Early 103Es had the three spoke banjo type Anglia/Prefect steering wheel as stocks of these were used up, but most have a two spoke wheel similar to the 100E wheel but in brown. Early Populars also had the single centrally mounted tail/stop-lamp of the Anglia, but this changed to a two tail/stop lamp set up with the lamps mounted on the mudguards and a separate number plate lamp. In total, 155,340 Popular E103s were produced.|$|E
