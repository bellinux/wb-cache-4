40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work {{was to assess the}} effects of {{long-term}} exposure to Cd on the <b>sulfatation</b> of glomerular membranes and their relation with proteinuria and urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAG). For this purpose the in vitro incorporation of [35 S]sulfate was investigated in female Sprague-Dawley rats given 100 ppm of Cd in drinking water for 7 months. When compared with their controls, glomeruli from Cd-treated rats showed a 12. 8 % decrease in the incorporation of the label into glomerular membranes. This effect, which was not explained by differences in viability or in sulfate uptake by the glomeruli, suggests that <b>sulfatation</b> of glomerular membranes is impaired in Cd-treated rats. In support of this, in another independent experiment, a decrease, 17. 4 % on average, of the sulfate content of glomerular membranes was observed in long-term Cd-treated rats (100 ppm in drinking water for 4 months). This effect was significantly correlated with albuminuria and transferrinuria but not with beta 2 -microglobinuria, suggesting that a loss of heparan sulfate of the glomerular capillary wall could be involved in the Cd-induced glomerular proteinuria. On the other hand an enhanced urinary excretion of GAG, negatively correlated with the sulfate content of glomerular membranes, was also observed in Cd-treated rats. Moreover GAG excretion was associated with tubular and glomerular proteinuria, which suggests that GAG might be a useful marker of Cd-induced nephrotoxicity...|$|E

To assess the ability of occurring pollutants in European coastal areas to disrupt the thyroid system in sea bass, a field study in the major European estuaries, namely, the Scheldt, the Seine, the Loire, the Charente and the Garonne has been conducted. Several thyroid endpoints were simultaneously examined. Diameter of follicles and the epithelial cell heights give an indication on the production and secretion activity of the thyroid gland. The activity of enzymes involved in the metabolism (deiodination, glucuronidation and <b>sulfatation)</b> of thyroid hormones was analyzed. Finally thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3) concentrations were analyzed in muscle by radioimmunoassay. The combined use of all those endpoints gives us {{an overview of the}} complex thyroid hormone system. PCB concentration in wild fish varied from 10 to 100 ng g- 1 wet weight (ww) depending on length and location. Each region has its own contamination levels and profiles reflecting the contribution of pollutants from rivers. The contamination levels were as follows: the highest concentrations were measured in individuals collected from the coastal region near the Scheldt > Seine > Loire > Charente and the lowest levels were observed in sea bass from coastal regions near the Garonne. Measurements of metabolic activity revealed an altered hepatic T 4 outer ring deiodinase whereas T 4 <b>sulfatation</b> and T 4 glucuronidation were not affected.

40|$|Studies in the {{laboratory}} have shown {{that a number of}} synthetic and natural chemicals can interfere with the endocrine system in fish. Among them, organic compounds such as pesticides and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) are well described endocrine disrupters. Of particular interest are effects on thyroid function, but data on effects of PCB exposure on these hormones and related metabolism has been lacking. We propose here a thorough approach to assess effects of these compounds on the thyroid function of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). An experimental exposure of sea bass to commercial PCB mixtures has been designed to understand underlying toxicity mechanisms and effects on the thyroid system. After 120 days of exposure, muscular thyroid hormone concentrations and the main metabolic pathways for thyroid hormones (deiodination, glucuronidation and <b>sulfatation)</b> were assessed. Exposure to environmental relevant doses of PCB (from 0. 3 to 0. 9 ppm [7 ICES PCB]). alters hepatic T 4 outer ring deiodinase and T 4 <b>sulfatation</b> whereas T 4 glucuronidation was not affected. Owing to the extensive autoregulatory feedback at both central and peripheral levels, the thyroid hormone concentrations were preserved despite the PCB induced changes in thyroid hormone dynamics. At 10 times higher concentrations (10 ppm [7 ICES PCB]). an important depression of muscular T 3 and T 4 levels could be observed which are apparently caused by other mechanisms than metabolic pathways. Further analysis is required to evaluate thyroid gland function and secretion. These results support the observations made in our field study in wild sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) from coastal regions near several important European rivers mouths. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Mathematically, the system is coupled, endowed with micro-macro transmission conditions, and posed on two different spatially-separated scales: one microscopic (pore scale) and one macroscopic (sewer pipe scale). We use a logarithmic expression to compute values of pH from the volume averaged concentration of sulfuric acid which is obtained by resolving numerically the two-scale system (microscopic equations with direct feedback with the macroscopic diffusion {{of one of the}} reactants).

Although steroidogenic activity of follicle cells is involved in oogenesis regulation, clear qualitative and quantitative data about the steroid content of follicles are missing. We measured steroid levels of Xenopus oocytes and follicles by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We show that dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate is the main steroid present in oocytes. Lower levels of free steroids are also detected, e. g., androgens, whereas progesterone is almost undetectable. We propose that <b>sulfatation</b> is a protective mechanism against local variations of active steroids that could be deleterious for follicle-enclosed oocytes. Steroid levels were measured after LH stimulation, responsible for the release by follicle cells of a steroid signal triggering oocyte meiosis resumption.

We here applied a multi-level approach of thyroid function assessment in 87 wild sea bass collected near several estuaries: namely the Scheldt, the Seine, the Loire, the Charente and the Gironde. Thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3) concentrations in muscle were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. The activity of hepatic enzymes involved in extrathyroidal pathways of thyroid hormone metabolism, viz. deiodination, glucuronidation and <b>sulfatation</b> were analyzed.

HIV- 1 p 17 contains C- and N-terminal sequences with positively charged residues and a consensus cluster for heparin binding. We demonstrated by affinity chromatography that HIV- 1 p 17 binds strongly to heparin-agarose at physiological pH.

40|$|Rutin and {{quercetin}} absorption and metabolism {{were investigated}} in rats after in situ perfusion of jejunum plus ileum (15 nmol/min). In contrast to rutin, {{a high proportion}} of quercetin (two-thirds) disappeared during perfusion, reflecting extensive transfer into the intestinal wall. Net quercetin absorption was not complete (2. 1 nmol/min), inasmuch as 52 % were reexcreted in the lumen as conjugated derivatives (7. 7 nmol/min). Enterohepatic recycling contribution of flavonoids was excluded by catheterization of the biliary duct before perfusion. After a 30 -min perfusion period, 0. 71 µM of quercetin equivalents were detected in plasma, reflecting a significant absorption from the small intestine. The differential hydrolysis of effluent samples by glucuronidase and/or sulfatase indicates that the conjugated forms released in the lumen were 1) glucuronidated derivatives of quercetin and of its methoxylated forms (64 %) and 2) sulfated form of quercetin (36 %). In vitro quercetin glucuronides synthetized using jejunal and ileal microsomal fractions were similar to those recovered in the effluent of perfusion. These data suggest that glucuronidation and <b>sulfatation</b> take place in intestinal cells, whereas no glucurono-sulfoconjugates could be detected in the effluent.

These potential endocrine disrupting chemicals {{were present in}} European coastal waters. Even if their concentrations were well below the Maximum Residue Limits set by the governments, they induced alterations of the endocrine system. We established correlations between contaminant concentrations and effects on the thyroid system in sea bass. The contaminants induced modifications of the metabolic pathways of thyroid hormones and enhanced thyroid hormone synthesis. The activity of T 4 Outer Ring Deiodinase was increased, {{that leads to a}}n intensified conversion of thyroxine (T 4) to its more biologically active form triiodothyronine (T 3). Meanwhile, the activity of T 4 <b>sulfatation</b> was reduced, that leads to a lowered biliary excretion of thyroid hormones.

Of all tested compounds, the higher chlorinated PCBs seemed to be the most implicated in this perturbation. The nature of thyroid hormone synthesis, signalling and regulation is highly conserved among vertebrates.

Recently, we have demonstrated inhibition of breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG 2) by olomoucine II and purvalanol A and shown that these compounds are able to synergistically potentiate the antiproliferative effect of mitoxantrone, an ABCG 2 substrate. In this follow up study, we investigated whether olomoucine II and purvalanol A are transported by ABCG 2 and ABCB 1 (P-glycoprotein). Using monolayers of MDCKII cells stably expressing human ABCB 1 or ABCG 2, we demonstrated that olomoucine II, but not purvalanol A, is a dual substrate of both ABCG 2 and ABCB 1. We, therefore, assume that pharmacokinetics of olomoucine II will be affected by both ABCB 1 and ABCG 2 transport proteins, which might potentially result in limited accumulation of the compound in tumor tissues or lead to drug-drug interactions. Pharmacokinetic behavior of purvalanol A, on the other hand, {{does not seem to be}} affected by either ABCG 2 or ABCB 1, theoretically favoring this drug in the potential treatment of efflux transporter-based multidrug resistant tumors. In addition, we observed intensive <b>sulfatation</b> of olomoucine II in MDCKII cell lines with subsequent active efflux of the metabolite out of the cells.

Bath, UK on 23 rd and 24 th September 2010 Primary (AL) Amyloidosis is {{a disease}} of protein misfolding. During plasma cell dyscrasia, such as micromolecular myeloma, plasma cells produce {{a great amount of}} monoclonal immunoglobulin free light chains (kappa or lambda FLCs) that may accumulate in different peripheral districts and determine tissue damages. It has been shown that FLCs induce oxidative stress and FLCs internalization in cardiac fibroblasts enhances <b>sulfatation</b> of secreted glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) suggesting that the intracellular trafficking pathway of FLCs could be correlated with the amiloydogenic potential of paraproteins. AIMS The mechanism of internalization and trafficking of FLCs is not well understood, so we aimed to characterize this pathway. METHODS In order to identify a correlation between the FLC phenotype and their pathogenicity, we have investigated the internalization rate of different lambda and kappa FLCs (belonging to hospitalized patients) in different cellular lines. Indeed, the mechanisms of internalization in different cellular subtypes might be an important key in the study of different pathological conditions strictly correlated to FLCs (systemic and not only kidney related) metabolism. RESULTS SUMMARY/CONCLUSION Our results highlight that the monoclonal FLCs of every patient behaves in a different way in different cellular lines and we could also show that not only epithelial cells are able to process paraproteins. Considering these data we could hypothesize that the interaction of FLCs with peripheral districts depends on high specific receptors expressed on certain cellular lines and/or that each patient has an individual clinical pattern due to the paraprotein molecular structure...|$|E
40|$|IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Idebenone is a {{synthetic}} short chain benzoquinone {{that acts as}} an electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, thereby, facilitating the production of ATP. In addition, idebenone is an antioxidant and can inhibit lipid peroxidation and may protect cell membranes and mitochondria from oxidative damage. High dose idebenone (Catena(®)) is approved in Canada for the symptomatic treatment of Friedreich's ataxia and is currently under clinical investigation {{for use in a}} number of mitochondrial and neuromuscular diseases. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This review summarizes the pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and clinical efficacy/safety data of idebenone and its metabolites and provides an update of the clinical trials completed and in progress. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: Following oral administration, idebenone is rapidly metabolized via oxidative shortening by a number CYP isoenzymes (CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 C 19, CYP 2 D 6 and CYP 3 A 4) to yield QS 10, QS 8, QS 6 and QS 4. Idebenone and these metabolites concomitantly undergo conjugation via glucuronidation and <b>sulfatation</b> to yield conjugated moieties represented as idebenone-C, QS 10 -C, QS 8 -C, QS 6 -C and QS 4 -C. Previous reports in the literature were only able to quantify plasma concentrations of idebenone measured together with its conjugates. More recently, highly sensitive and specific liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometric methods have been developed, allowing the quantification of the parent molecule idebenone and its main metabolite QS 10, separately. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: After absorption, idebenone is rapidly metabolized by first pass metabolism and shows dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects in daily doses up to 2250 mg. The recent development of advanced analytical techniques allows the detection of idebenone and unconjugated metabolites in plasma and consequently opens the possibility for evaluation of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships which will be helpful to further understand the metabolism and therapeutic potential of idebenone.

The S and V loadings {{are similar to those of}} TiO 2 based commercial catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction of NOx by NH 3 : NH 3 -SCR. Two original experimental procedures are used, namely, adsorption equilibrium infrared spectroscopy (AEIR) and temperature-programmed adsorption equilibrium (TPAE). They have been developed in previous works and adapted in Part 1 for the species formed by the adsorption of NH 3 on a sulfate free TiO 2 support (P 25 from Degussa). In agreement with the literature, Raman and FTIR spectroscopies show that the impregnation of the sulfate-free and sulfated TiO 2 supports by the vanadium precursor leads to well-dispersed VxOy species, which are involved in the adsorption of NH 3 in the temperature T-a range of 300 - 673 K and for adsorption P-a < 0. 5 IcPa. Sulfate and VxOy groups favor the amount of NH 4 + species without modifying their heats of adsorption as compared to the TiO 2, support: they are not detected for temperatures of interest for NH 3 -SCR reaction. In these experimental conditions and whatever the solids, two main adsorbed NH 3 species on Lewis sites (denoted NH 3 ads. L 1 and NH 3 ads. L 2) are present, characterized by two delta(s) IR bands below 1300 cm(- 1) and a common delta(as), IR band at approximate to 1600 cm(- 1). By comparison with TiO 2, P 25; it is shown that sulfate groups have strong impacts neither on the proportion, x(1) and x(2),, of the two adsorbed species nor on their heats of adsorption (E-L 1 (theta) and E-L 2 (theta) with theta the coverage of the NH 3 ads.

The deposition of V-containing species on the sulfate-free and sulfated TiO 2 surfaces leads to similar conclusions: in the experimental conditions (Ta and Pa) of the NH 3 -SCR, two adsorbed NH 3 species on Lewis sites are detected with comparable proportions and heats of adsorption to those observed on the TiO 2 supports...|$|E

A goma comercial (GGNP) e a purificada (GGFISFEH) foram reticuladas com glutaraldeÃdo para originar hidrogÃis fluidos de alta viscosidade. O aumento da viscosidade do polissacarÃdeo com o tempo de reaÃÃo de reticulaÃÃo Ã gradativo e pode ser interrompido no momento em que se obtÃm um hidrogel fluido, por diÃlise contra Ãgua. Os hidrogÃis obtidos tem viscosidade quarenta vezes (GelGGNP) e oitocentas vezes (GelGGFISFEH) a viscosidade das soluÃÃes iniciais das gomas. A goma guar purificada (GGFISFEH) foi modificada por reaÃÃo de oxidaÃÃo com reagente TEMPO e por reaÃÃo de sulfataÃÃo, com a finalidade de introduzir grupos carboxilato e sulfato, assemelhando a estrutura desta ao Ãcido hialurÃnico e ao condroitim sulfato. As reaÃÃes foram eficientes na modificaÃÃo, resultando em grau de substituiÃÃo (GS) de 0, 36 para a goma oxidada (GGOXID) e 0, 60 para a sulfatada (GGSULF). AnÃlises de RMN de 13 C e 1 H indicam que a sulfataÃÃo ocorreu no C 6 da galactose e a oxidaÃÃo no C 6 da manose. A quitina foi carboximetilada para originar um polieletrÃlito solÃvel em Ãgua e com grupo acetil glicosamina semelhante ao do Ãcido hialurÃnico. Esta reaÃÃo foi testada em vÃrias condiÃÃes reacionais, resultando em GS diferentes. O melhor rendimento foi de 92 % com um GS de 0, 53. Os testes farmacolÃgicos foram realizados em ratos Wistar. Avaliou-se o efeito per si na cavidade articular de GGNP e GGFISFEH, ambas em soluÃÃo e gel. A GGNP causou incapacitaÃÃo e influxo celular dosedependente, efeito nÃo demonstrado por GGFISFEH. A incapacitaÃÃo articular foi maior com a administraÃÃo do GelGGNP. Avaliou-se tambÃm, o efeito terapÃutico da GGFISFEH em soluÃÃo e gel, e Hilano G-F 20 em osteoartrite induzida pelo modelo de transecÃÃo do ligamento cruzado anterior. A inibiÃÃo da incapacitaÃÃo articular obtida pelo gel ou pela soluÃÃo de guar foram absolutamente semelhantes ao resultado obtido com o Hilano G-F 20. A goma guar apresenta potencial como agente viscossuplementador. The viscosupplementation is {{a therapeutic}} technique {{used in the}} osteoarthritis treatment, in which the sinovial fluid (lubricant of the ligaments) is replaced by viscoelastic solutions derived from hyaluronic acid with rheological properties better than the starting material. This treatment is expensive and commercially, only hialuronic acid is used. The research of other polysaccharides such as the guar gum and chitin, for the application on viscosupplementation, increases the possibility of substituting the hyaluronic acid with other from more abundant sources and more viable. The guar gum (GGNP) was purified through various methods with the aim to reduce contaminants, such as polysaccharides (but not galactomannan) and most importantly, proteins. The method with best efficiency in the reduction of these contaminants was the physic+Fehling method, resulting in a guar (GGFISFEH) with 96 % of galactomannan and 0 % of proteins. The commercial gum (GGNP) and the purified (GGFISFEH) were crosslinked with glutaraldehyde to originate fluids hydrogel of high viscosity. The increase in viscosity of the polysaccharides {{with the increase of}} the crosslinking reaction time is gradual and can be interrupted at the moment a hydrogel fluid is obtained through dialysis against water. The hydrogels obtained have viscosity forty times (GelGGNP) and eight hundred times (GelGGFISFEH) than the initial viscosities of the gums. The purified guar gum (GGFISFEH) was modified through oxidative reaction with a TEMPO reagent and through a <b>sulfatation</b> reaction, with the aim of introducing carboxylated and sulphate groups, making their structure similar to the one from the hyaluronic acid and the chondroitin sulfate. The reactions were efficient in the modification, resulting in degree of substitution (DS) of 0. 36 for the oxidated gum (GGOXID) and 0. 60 for the sulfated gum(GGSULF). 13 C and 1 H NMR analyses indicated that the <b>sulfatation</b> occurred in C 6 of galactose and the oxidation on C 6 of mannose The chitin was carboxylated to form a water soluble polyeletrolite and with a group of acetyl glucosamine similar to the hyaluronic acid. This reaction was tested in various conditions, resulting in different DS. The best yield was of 92 % with a DS of 0. 53. The pharmacological tests were conducted on rats Wistar. The effect, per si, in the articulate cavity of GGNP and GFISFEH, both in solution and gel was also studied. The GGNP caused incapacitation and dosage-dependant cell influx, an effect not demonstrated by GGFISFEH. The articular incapacitation was greater with the administration of GelGGNP. It was also evaluated the therapeutic effect of GGFISFEH in solution and gel, and Hilano G-F 20 in osteoarthritis induced by the transection of the anterior cruciate ligament. The inhibition of the articular incapacitation obtained through gel or through the guar solution were entirely similar to the results obtained with the Hilano G-F 20. The guar gum presents potential as a viscosuplemented agent...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Remodeling bone tissue by {{insertion}} of resorbable bone substitution material (BSM) is a therapeutic strategy for bone defects caused by malignant diseases like multiple myeloma (MM). The migration and tube formation of vascular endothelial cells (EC) {{in the material}} {{is a prerequisite for}} successful angiogenesis as part of bone regeneration 1. For the application of BSM in cancer patients it has to be considered that tumor cells may have angiogenic capacity on their own and that they are able to propagate osteolytic activity at the same time. To promote angiogenesis, growth factors (GF) like VEGF are often bound to the replacement material via heparin to induce cell migration and vessel ingrowth 2. As heparin can enhance osteoclastic bone resorption by sequestering osteoprotegerin (OPG) 3 we screened for alternative poly-saccharides (PS) to promote non malignant cell proliferation, GF binding and bone formation. Materials and methods: Besides heparin as an established PS we screened other PS for their angiogenic potential (tube formation assay), growth factor binding (microscale thermophoresis) and influence on proliferation of EC, fibroblasts andMMcells. All these are abilities important for angiogenesis and bone-turnover. Finally we applied co-cultures of fibroblasts and EC on collagen-based, PS coated, cylindrically BSM (3 x 5 mm) and analyzed for cellmigration and tube formation. Results: The PS investigated showed divergent results on the proliferation of selected cell types, promotion of angiogenesis and OPG binding. A promising candidate was a cellulose sulfate with special <b>sulfatation</b> pattern (TACS). Unlike heparin TACS did not reduce the proliferation of endothelial cells while still showing a similar angiogenic capacity. In addition TACS binds OPG to a lower extent than heparin. In 3 D cultures of BSM coated with TACS vessels tend to form earlier than in control scaffolds. After 28 days in cell culture BSM were colonized to almost 90 % by cells while lumen containing vessels formed in the upper parts of the scaffold (~ 50 %) (Fig. 1). Other cellulose sulfates improved the proliferation of EC or hampered the proliferation of MM so that a combined application of these together with TACSswill be the next step. Discussion and conclusions: Co-culture of fibroblasts and HUVECs on collagen matrix leads to a vessel network in the BSM making this a promising combination of cells for preseeding. We showed that PS can improve the ability of early vessels formation, proliferation and growth factor binding. As no PS so far possesses all good attributes alone, we plan to modify the scaffolds with a combination of different PS. This way we hope to find a reliable tool to improve bone healing in multiple myeloma patients.

40|$|About thirty {{complete}} articulated {{skeletons of}} iguanodons have been excavated from Bernissart. This unique collection is conserved at the RBINS. The bones excavated were {{the object of}} diverse physical and chemical treatments {{to protect them from}} their degradation. These bones were not the object of detailed mineralogical analyses allowing to understand either diagenetic mechanisms involved or to understand the specific mechanisms of their change. This work thus aims at filling this lack. It integrates petrographic (POM, SEM), mineralogical (DRX, Raman Spectroscopy) and chemical (EDS, X-ray fluorescence, microprobe) techniques. By these methods, 30 different minerals were identified. The diagenesis of Iguanodon bones is the result of cumulative physical, chemical and biological processes that will modify the original chemical and/or structural properties of this organic object. Bone diagenesis is a complex process that includes the degradation of organic matter, the dissolution and recrystallization of bone apatite, the enrichment in trace elements, the precipitation of new minerals in the bone cavities (permineralisation), the fracturation process. A plan is proposed positioning in a relative timescale minerals formed during 3 diagenetic stages and the degradation processes engaged following the bones exhumation. During burial variable recrystallisation took place: the slightly crystallized carbonated hydroxylapatite (the mineral phase of fresh bone tissue) was replaced by well crystallized carbonated fluorapatite currently present in the Iguanodon bones. Whereas some minerals infiltrated in the bone during cavity filling by the sediment (“mainly” quartz, “argillaceous” phyllosilicates), others are authigenic and precipitated in the cavities during burial (pyrite, barite, sphalerite, celestine, iron oxi-hydroxides, authigenic apatite, calcium sulfate {{and to a lesser extent}} vivianite). Pyrite is the most abundant authigenic mineral in the Iguanodon fossil bones. It occurs in different morphologies (crystals, framboids, sticks, fibroradial structure, thin coating…). Four kind of pyrite were determined according to the diagenesis phase during which they were formed and the source of iron and sulfur. Besides pyrite barite is the second most abundant phase. When both minerals are present pyrite has been formed first. The distribution of these minerals within bones is more controlled by micro-environments than by particular structure of the bone. Since their discovery the Iguanodon fossil bones were treated for conservation in several ways. This however did not prevent the alteration of pyrite into an assemblage of 16 different secondary minerals. The ferrous sulfates (szomolnokite and rozenite) are the most abundant of these minerals and can be found in nearly all samples sulfatized. Other sulfates were formed as the result of alteration of the wealdian shale by acid produced by pyrite oxidation: e. g. tschermigite, natrojarosite and halotrichite. Gypsum, anhydrite, iron phosphate and diadochite are the result of dissolution of bone apatite. The variations of relative humidity in collections and in showrooms are responsible for the pursuit of the bones degradation (<b>sulfatation</b> of the residual sulfides; fracturing by dilation / contraction). The relative humidity, conjugated to the temperature variations are the parameters to be controlled for a better preservation of these invaluable fossils. Techniques implementing some chemicals products proposed in the literature are applicable only to certain objects of limited size...|$|E
40|$|Together {{with its}} endothelial ligands, L-selectin mediates {{leukocyte}} rolling on vascular endothelium, thereby initiating {{the first step}} of an adhesion cascade that leads to transmigration of leukocytes into the perivascular tissue. On the one hand, L-selectin is thus essential for physiological immune defense; on the other hand, it is involved in pathological inflammatory reactions, e. g. transplant rejection or autoimmune diseases. It is therefore a target structure for antiinflammatory agents that inhibit leukocyte recruitment into inflamed tissue by L-selectin blockade. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the inhibition of L-selectin binding to its ligands by synthetic multivalent ligands on the basis of Sialyl Lewis x, glycomimetics and recombinant glycoproteins. These examinations were performed on the level of individual molecules and that of intact cells under flow conditions in order to take into account the shear stress dependence of L-selectin binding. Different inhibitors were examined by developing a standardized test system that measured the binding of recombinant divalent L-selectin-IgG to the synthetic ligand SiaLex-PAA-sTyr by means of surface plasmon resonance. In addition, inhibitors were examined by adapting a flow chamber assay to measure the rolling and adhesion of transfected L-selectin-expressing NALM- 6 cells on activated HUVECs. Both procedures were used to measure the inhibitory activity of multivalent forms of Sialyl Lewis x, Sialyl Lewis a and tyrosine sulfate  covalently bound to the carrier polyacrylamide  in comparison to the monovalent forms of these ligands. The examinations showed that multivalence markedly enhances the inhibitory activity, and increasing shear stress intensifies the inhibitory effect of multivalent inhibitors. Polyglycerol sulfate dendrimers were used to examine a second class of multivalent inhibitors. The results showed a remarkably strong inhibitory effect of these multivalent inhibitors. Polyglycerol sulfate dendrimers were specific for L- and P-selectin but did not inhibit the function of E-selectin. Third, the macrolide efomycine M was used to examine the inhibitory activity of a glycomimetic. Efomycine M was specific for L-selectin but did not inhibit E- or P-selectin binding. These examinations showed that even monovalent inhibitors exert a strong inhibitory effect. Two potential inhibitory glycoproteins were constructed as fusion proteins on the basis of the physiological ligand PSGL- 1 and Hsc 70, for which an L-selectin-binding cell surface form was recently described: PSGL- 1 -IgG as the fusion protein of the N-terminus of PSGL- 1 with three tyrosine residues and one O-glycan, which represent the L-selectin binding motive of PSGL- 1, and Hsc 70 -IgG as the fusion protein of a sequence segment of Hsc 70 of the position 279 - 299, which shows similarity to the PSGL- 1 binding motive. The expression took place in the human cell line KG 1 a, which is suitable for glycosylation and <b>sulfatation.</b> Examinations utilizing surface plasmon resonance showed a comparably strong binding of PSGL- 1 -IgG and Hsc 70 -IgG to L-selectin. This result indicated that the recombinant glycoproteins PSGL- 1 -IgG and Hsc 70 -IgG are potent inhibitors of L-selectin function, at least in their divalent form. The results of this study document the availability of multi- and monovalent inhibitors of L-selectin binding that open up prospects for the development of new anti-inflammatory drug strategies...|$|E

40|$|Glycans form cell-specific {{patterns}} on cell surfaces, which alter {{in a typical}} manner during development, differentiation or infection of a cell. Nowadays, changes in the glycosylation are discussed as biomarkers in the diagnosis of multiple diseases such as cancer or inflammation (Dennis et al. 1999; Reis et al. 2010). In the present work the N-glycosylation of human blood serum and the N- and O-glycosylation of human saliva was analysed. Blood serum N-glycosylation High-mannose and hybrid-type N-glycans {{play an important role}} in the immune response. Using the enzyme Endo H, high-mannose and hybrid type N-glycans in human blood serum could selectively be released and characterised by MALDI-TOF-MS, MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS, HPAEC-PAD and CE-LIF. Analysis of oligosaccharide structures using CE-LIF not only led to a faster detection of glycans, but also made an analysis of structural isomers possible. Electropherogram migration times of high-mannose oligosaccharides were assigned by comparison with known structures generated from control protein RNase B. The Endo H-released N-glycan pool was seperated by HPEAC-PAD and the obtained fractions were analysed by CE-LIF allowing for an unambiguous identification of the N-glycan hybride-types. In order to develop diagnostic applications based on the analysis of the human blood serum glycom, glycan release and purification must be time- and cost-efficient. In the present work a MAED-method (Microwave-Assisted Enzymatic Digestion) for the denaturation of serum proteins and the enzymatical release of N-glycans with subsequent purification over self-made SP 20 SS/graphite tips was developed. The denaturation with Pronase and the Endo H release of N-glycans was performed in a microwave during 10 min (2 x 5 min; 700 Watt). The purification step was performed on self-made SP 20 SS/graphite tips. Furthermore, the elution volumes were reduced from 1, 2 mL by C 18 /Carbograph to 90 µL by SP 20 SS/graphite tips which minimised the evaporation time of solvent from 3 h to 30 min. In summary the time necessary for the preparation of blood serum N-glycans was reduced from 21 hours to one hour. Based on the results obtained from the MAED-method, SP 20 SS/graphite purification and CE-LIF analysis, diagnostic studies Endo H released N-glycans could be realised. Comparison between the glycom of healthy control and patients with ovarian and colon cancer showed that the sialylated hybrid structures Neu 5 AcGalMan 4 GlcNAc 2 and Neu 5 AcGalMan 5 GlcNAc 2 were significantly under-expressed in samples with ovarian cancer. Furthermore, in samples with ovarian and colon cancer an under expression in the second and third isomer of high-mannose Man 7 GlcNAc was observed. The oxazoline derivatives generated in the PNGase F-MAED were used in transglycosylation reactions. The in vitro expression of glycoproteins could provide a new route for efficient and specific therapeutic agents against certain diseases. Endo M catalysed the transglycoslation reaction between oxazoline derivatives and modified RNase B protein. During the transglycosylation reaction diantennary N-glycan of transferrin was transferred by Endo M of the Endo H treated RNase B. Human saliva glycosylation With the MAED-method for the denaturation of saliva glycoproteins and the concentration of the glycopeptides on a ZIC®-HILIC column, a rapid method could be developed which provides high yields on N- and O-glycans. The consecutive release of N- and O-glycans afforded multiple structural informations. N-glycans were enzymatically released (PNGase F) and O-glycans chemically (β-elimination). The N- and O-glycosylation of human saliva was analysed by MALDI-TOF-MS und MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. Thereby, the secretor-status, sialylation, <b>sulfatation</b> and fucosylaltion was identified and characterised. In addition, isomeric structures of N- and O-glycans were analysed. The MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of N-glycans provided a high structural diversity in high fucosylated and/or sialylated di-, tri- and tetra-antennary complex-typ N-glycans, high-mannose and hybrid-typ N-glycans. O-glycans could be detected from m/z 500 to m/z 4000. Saliva samples with secretor-status were found to be dominated by fucosylated O-glycans whereas in samples with non-secretor-status, sialylated O-glycans were found to be most abundant. Furthermore, depending on the blood group it was possible to identify core- 1, core- 2, core- 3 and core- 4 structures, lewis-epitopes: Lea/x-, Leb/y- and sLea/x-epitope and ABH-epitopes...|$|E
40|$|HA is an {{atypical}} GAG because, {{although it}} is composed by GlcUA and GlcNAc, it does not contain <b>sulfatation</b> {{and it is not}} linked to any PG core protein. Moreover, HA synthesis is on plasma membrane by HASs, instead of Golgi. HA, as hydrophilic and viscous polysaccharide, increases the volume of extracellular space, thus contributing to tissue remodeling and facilitating cell mobility. This classical view of HA as a space filler and swelling agent has been complemented recently by interesting findings indicating that it mediates homing of stem cells, leukocyte adherence to endothelial cells, monocyte binding to virally infected or stressed mesenchymal cells and bacterial adherence. Furthermore, high molecular mass HA and its oligosaccharide degradation products create specific intracellular signals that promote cell locomotion, influence cell division, block apoptosis and induce membrane transporters (Rahmanian et al., 1997; Takahashi et al., 2005). Moreover, HA has a proatherosclerotic role in vascular diseases, because it promotes cellular migration and proliferation and because it’s involved in immune cells recruitment. As the synthesis of HA precursors requires ATP, UTP and other critical metabolic molecules (as glucose, glutamine and acetyl-CoA) making the HA production an energy consuming process, we hypnotized that in condition of low energy charge this anabolic process could be controlled by AMPK, a serine/threonine kinase which works as an energy sensor in all eukaryotic cells. In condition of low ATP content, this enzyme is activated and subsequently it switches off several anabolic processes (i. e. : gluconeogenesis, fatty acids synthesis, lipolysis, glycogen synthesis) and switches on some catabolic events (i. e. : glycolisis, fatty acids -oxidation) inside the cell. Moreover AMPK activation can be regulated not only by a decrement of ATP/AMP ratio, but also by physiological stimuli independent of the energy status of the cell, including hormones, nutrient depletion, heat shock and some drugs as metformin and AICAR. In the present study, we have used human aortic smooth muscle cells (hAoSMCs) because they produce an elevate amount of HA, essential for their proliferation and migration and for immune cells recruitment. All these processes are the most critical events involved in the onset of neointima formation, which is a pivotal step for the development and progression of all vascular diseases (including atherosclerosis), a main complication in diabetes. In fact, physiologically, SMCs resides in the tunica media in a contractile quiescent phenotype determining the vessel tone, whereas the neointima-forming SMCs posses a synthetic phenotype that induces cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, synthetic SMCs produce many ECM molecules, including HA, and ECM modifying enzymes, as metalloproteinases (Vigetti et al., 2006). The increment of HA in the media induces SMC motility through the interaction with CD 44 and RHAMM (Savani et al., 1995). SMCs produced HA enhances immune cell recruitment and SMC dedifferentiation (Cuff et al., 2001). Therefore the ability to control and regulate HA biosynthesis by AMP-activated protein kinase could be a new good strategy to arrest atherosclerotic progression. In this work, AMPK-activation has been induced by AICAR, metformin and 2 -deoxyglucose (2 -DG) treatments, observing a significant and dose-dependent reduction of HA biosynthesis and an unchanged production of the other GAGs. These observations has been confirmed using different AICAR inhibitors (AMDA and Dipyridamole) and specific AMPK inhibitor (Compound C), and by transient transfections with constitutive active form of AMPK (CAAMPK) in AMPK-/- Mef-t cells. As the reduction of HA synthesis induced by AMPK activation was not due to an alteration of expression of genes involved in HA metabolism (as verified by quantitative RT-PCR analyses), we hypothesized that AMPK could act at post-transcriptional level, modifying the activity of HA synthetic enzymes (i. e. : Has 1, Has 2 and Has 3). Cotransfecting each HAS isoform with (CA) AMPK in COS 1 cells we found that AMPK specifically inhibits HAS 2 activity. As AMPK is a kinase, we assayed whether a phosphorylative event could control HAS 2 activity: by treatments in COS 1 membrane fractions with SAP and CIP we observed that the removal of the hypothetic phosphorylation site fully restores HAS 2 activity. For these reasons we hypothesized that AMPK could downregulate HA-synthesis inhibiting HAS 2 activity by phosphorylation. In order to confirm this results, we have performed an immunoprecipitation assay in transfected COS 1 cells, following by mass spectrometry analysis (MS-analysis). As HA has a pivotal role in some processes involved in the onset of atherosclerotic plaque as cell proliferation, migration and immune cells recruitment, we assayed the involvement of AMPK in those. Using hAoSMCs, we have demonstrated the ability of AMPK (activated by transfection as well as by treatments with AICAR and metformin) to arrest cell-cycle in G 0 /G 1 phase, without causing apoptosis, to inhibit cell migration and to reduce monocytes adhesion. Taken together these results demonstrate that AICAR and metformin could have a new inhibitory effect on HA synthesis in hAoSMCs and an additional vasoprotective effect. Moreover, the increasing number of processes in which HA is involved suggest that to know the way to control and regulate its metabolism could be an important finding for a large number of medical applications as cancer, diabetes and atherosclerosis...|$|E
