5|$|Aside {{from the}} transit room {{conversion}} to office <b>space</b> <b>the</b> building has seen other major {{work in the}} past.

Another major addition occurred in 1966 with the construction of the large east wing. Of the same cream colored brick as the 1956 addition, it also tried to mimic the building's finer details. The 1966 east wing addition provided for, again, more office space, but this project also included space for a new darkroom and a radio telescope laboratory.

5|$|The {{significance}} {{of the concept of}} a Hilbert space was underlined with the realization that it offers one of the best mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics.

The relation between quantum mechanical symmetries and unitary operators provided an impetus {{for the development of the}} unitary representation theory of groups, initiated in the 1928 work of Hermann Weyl. On the other hand, in the early 1930s it became clear that classical mechanics can be described in terms of Hilbert space (Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics) and that certain properties of classical dynamical systems can be analyzed using Hilbert space techniques in the framework of ergodic theory.|$|E

The theory of Sobolev mappings between manifolds has been extended {{to the case of}} Sobolev mappings with values into metric spaces. Finally analysis on metric <b>spaces,</b> <b>the</b> theory of Carnot– Carathéodory <b>spaces,</b> and <b>the</b> theory of quasiconformal mappings between metric <b>spaces</b> led to <b>the</b> theory of Sobolev mappings between metric <b>spaces.</b> <b>The</b> {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide a self-contained introduction to the theory of Sobolev spaces between manifolds and metric <b>spaces.</b> <b>The</b> paper also discusses new results of the author. ...|$|R
