40|$|This paper {{presents}} an object tracking system that utilises a hybrid multi-layer motion segmentation and optical flow algorithm. While many tracking systems seek to combine multiple modalities such as motion and depth or multiple inputs within a fusion system to improve tracking robustness, current systems have avoided {{the combination of}} motion and optical flow. This combination allows {{the use of multiple}} modes within the object detection stage. Consequently, different categories of objects, within motion or <b>stationary,</b> <b>can</b> be effectively detected utilising either optical flow, static foreground or active foreground information. The proposed system is evaluated using the ETISEO database and evaluation metrics and compared to a baseline system utilising a single mode foreground segmentation technique. Results demonstrate a significant improvement in tracking results can be made through the incorporation of the additional motion information. ...|$|E
40|$|An oil stream falling {{vertically}} into {{a stationary}} bath {{of the same}} liquid, if its flow speed is above a critical threshold, because of its viscous property, will induce a transition where a “cusp” on the free surface is “cracked” open by the jet. This industrially important phenomenon has been well studied. However, results {{from the present study}} indicate that there is still some puzzling issue of this phenomenon, concerning the stability of the “cusp” before the transition. And this issue becomes more complicated when a constant bath motion is introduced. New “dynamical states” that are not possible when the bath is <b>stationary</b> <b>can</b> arise when energy is continuously supplied into the system by the externally driven constant flow of the bath liquid. Multiple “dynamical states” can exist for the same experimental conditions. The system can exhibit slight hysteretic behavior...|$|E

40|$|As in rabbit, gerbil, and rat, the {{guinea pig}} {{interstitial}} {{nucleus of the}} superior fasciculus, posterior bundle (INSFp) is a sparse assemblage of neurons scattered among the fibers forming the fasciculus bearing this name. Most of the INSFp neurons are small and are ovoid in shape. Interspersed among these, are a few larger, elongated neurons whose density becomes greater and whose shape becomes fusiform in correspondence to the zone of transition from the superior fasciculus to the ventral part of the medial terminal nucleus (MTN). Like the MTN, the INSFp is activated by retinal-slip signals evoked by whole-field visual patterns moving in the vertical direction, {{as shown by the}} increase of 14 C- 2 -deoxyglucose (2 DG) uptake into this nucleus. At the same level of luminous flux, neither pattern moving in the horizontal direction nor the same pattern held <b>stationary</b> <b>can</b> elicit increases in the INSFp 2 DG assumption.

In order to investigate the feasibility of teleconsultation using a new generation of cellular phones, a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy of online diagnosis of skin tumours was conducted.

40|$|In an agent-mediated B 2 C Internet marketplace, agents, mobile or <b>stationary,</b> <b>can</b> act {{on behalf}} of {{customers}} to complete tasks involved in buying and selling products. In this paper, we first present a fuzzy-set based two-phase evaluation model allowing mobile agents to evaluate and filter online e-shops, and evaluate offers autonomously and automatically at the request from a consumer. The fuzzy evaluation criterion takes into account not only the attributes of offers, but also the reputation of corresponding e-shops. Meanwhile, the two-phase operations can help reduce the scale of mobile agents dispatched to e-shops and thus reduce the network workload. Based on the same fuzzy evaluation criterion, an auction-like negotiation model is presented, where the consumer agent can autonomously determine the initial offer and negotiate with multiple shops simultaneously. The final best offer is determined {{not only by the}} attributes of the offers, but also the attributes of the e-shops as well as the preference the consumer specified. Finally, our models presented in this paper have been implemented in a prototype system where we conducted some experiments to evaluate their performance. 23 page(s...|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} whether observables of an exactly solvable model of electrons coupled to (optical) phonons relax into large time stationary state values and investigate if the asymptotic expectation values can be computed using a stationary density matrix. Two initial nonequilibrium situations are considered. A sudden quench of the electron-phonon coupling, starting from the noninteracting canonical equilibrium at temperature T in the electron {{as well as in}} the phonon subsystems, leads to a rather simple dynamics. A richer time evolution emerges if the initial state is taken as the product of the phonon vacuum and the filled Fermi sea supplemented by a highly excited additional electron. Our model has a natural set of constants of motion, with as many elements as degrees of freedom. In accordance with earlier studies of such type of models we find that expectation values which become <b>stationary</b> <b>can</b> be described by the density matrix of a generalized Gibbs ensemble which differs from that of a canonical ensemble. For the model at hand it appears to be evident that the eigenmode occupancy operators should be used in the construction of the stationary density matrix.

40|$|A {{fault with}} two {{asperities}} is modelled {{as a system}} made of two blocks coupled by a spring and sliding on a plane under the same values of static and dynamic friction. An analytical solution is given for the simultaneous motion of the blocks and the corresponding orbits are plotted in the phase space. It is proven that, whichever the initial state is, the long-term behaviour {{of the system is}} one of an infinite number of limit cycles, characterized by a particular pattern of forces. The region where the system is located when the blocks are <b>stationary</b> <b>can</b> be divided into narrow stripes corresponding to different orbits of the points belonging to them. This implies that the system is sensitive to perturbations and has relevant implications for a fault, which is subject to stress transfers from earthquakes generated by neighbouring faults. In this case, the fault may experience a larger earthquake, with the simultaneous failure of the two asperities, which restores a stress distribution compatible with periodic behaviour. The seismic moment associated with simultaneous asperity failure is always greater than the maximum value that can be released in a limit cycle. For strongly coupled asperities, the moment can be several times larger...|$|E
