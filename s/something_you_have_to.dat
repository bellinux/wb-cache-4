We can take heat if there's {{something}} wrong {{and people can}} review shows badly– that's <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> live with– but to say people {{stormed out of the}} show was an absolute fabrication. Britney is aware of all this and she's extremely upset by it. She's a human being. I'm embarrassed, with such a big international entourage here with Britney, {{to be part of the}} Australian media when I see that kind of totally inaccurate reporting. It's been all over the internet for nine months, the inference is that we tried to hide this. It's been the opposite. This show is about an incredible spectacle, which it is".|$|E
500|$|The {{challenge}} of coordinating these projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising {{the plans for}} them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. [...] "Design is <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> put your hand to," [...] he said. [...] "While my people {{had the luxury of}} doing one job at a time, I had {{to keep track of the}} whole enterprise." [...] Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I.M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.|$|E

She said it portrays [...] "one of those situations where you just feel that leaving this person is <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do {{to get to know}} yourself again." [...] "Secret" [...] was about an ex-girlfriend who was uncomfortable about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Ivey {{was gaining}} recognition, {{and was able}} to quit his day job, he was notorious for his {{reluctance}} to attend opening parties, do publicity, or seek out commissions, and for his gruff, workmanlike approach to painting. [...] "Painting is <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do all the time," [...] he told arts journalist Regina Hackett in a 1992 interview. [...] "If you don't, it becomes too important, too charged with meaning, and you can't bring yourself to do it. For me, it's like tying my shoes in a way." ...|$|E
