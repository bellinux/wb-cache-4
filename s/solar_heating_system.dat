Hot water from the collectors fed a 6,000-gallon insulated tank, which provided a reserve for nights and cloudy periods. Under normal conditions the water in the tank would be sufficiently warm to directly heat the building, but if the temperature in the tank dropped (e.g. due to prolonged cloudy weather), a heat pump could be employed to extract the remaining useful heat from the water stream.|$|E

50|$|Bridgers and Paxton came up {{with the}} idea for an {{experimental}} solar-heated building in the early 1950s. After two years of design work, the Solar Building was constructed between March and August 1956 for a cost of $58,500. The heating system operated successfully for six years but was nevertheless converted to a conventional boiler system when the building was expanded in 1962. However, the 1973 oil crisis caused a renewed interest in solar energy and brought fresh attention to the Solar Building. In early 1974, Penn State researcher Stanley Gilman received an NSF grant to restore the building's <b>solar</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> and operate it as part of a multi-year field study. The system was deactivated following the conclusion of the project but remains mostly intact.|$|E

40|$|The {{increase}} {{in the use of}} solar collectors in recent years for domestic hot water preparation has shown that <b>solar</b> <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> are a mature and reliable technology. Motivated by the confirmed success of these systems for hot water production, an increasing number of homebuilders are considering solar energy for space heating, as well. Combining <b>solar</b> <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> with short-term <b>heat</b> storage and high standards of thermal insulation of the building allows the heating requirements of a single- or multi-family dwelling to be met at acceptable costs. Compared to systems using seasonal storage (the costs of which are currently not affordable for single-family houses), this combination provides a cost-effective system with high efficiency. <b>Solar</b> <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> for combined domestic hot water preparation and space heating, called “solar combisystems ” are essentially the same as solar water heaters when considering the collectors and the transport of the produced heat to the storage device. But solar combisystems are more complex than solar domestic hot water systems, as there are more interactions with extra subsystems. And these interactions deeply affect the overall performance of the solar par...|$|R
