50|$|Vertical sliding {{bearings}} in hornblocks would allow movement, but these must be designed carefully {{or else the}} force exerted through the rods would be wasted in simply sliding this bearing back and forth. Such sliding joints must be arranged to allow suspension travel, but so that the rod force is always {{at right angles to}} the <b>slideway.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Examples of {{stick-slip}} can {{be heard}} from hydraulic cylinders, tractor wet brakes, honing machines etc. Special dopes {{can be added to}} the hydraulic fluid or the cooling fluid to overcome or minimize the stick-slip effect. Stick-slip is also experienced in lathes, mill centres, and other machinery where something slides on a <b>slideway.</b> <b>Slideway</b> oils typically list [...] "prevention of stick-slip" [...] as one of their features. Other examples of the stick-slip phenomenon include the music that comes from bowed instruments, the noise of car brakes and tires, and the noise of a stopping train. Stick-slip also has been observed in articular cartilage in mild loading and sliding conditions, which could result in an abrasive wear of the cartilage. Another example of the stick-slip phenomenon occurs when musical notes are played with a glass harp by rubbing a wet finger along the rim of a crystal wine glass. One animal that produces sound using stick-slip friction is the spiny lobster which rubs its antennae over smooth surfaces on its head. Another, more common example which produces sound using stick-slip friction is the grasshopper.|$|E

Once the slideways were retracted back into the catapult track wells and the tow cables unhooked, the launch trollies would be manually pushed forward onto recovery platforms, lowered to the forecastle on [...] "B" [...] deck, then rolled back into the upper hangar for re-use via a secondary set of rails. When not in use, the catapult tracks were to be covered with sheet metal farings to protect them from harsh weather.|$|E
40|$|The {{flatness}} {{of machine}} slideways and surface plates is often {{critical to the}} precision of machined surfaces or the accuracy of measurements. Yet {{there are very few}} viable methods or techniques for measuring this important parameter. The most common methods use auto-collimators or electronic levels to measure angular deviations in the surface to arrive at an estimation of the flatness. These methods are time-consuming and result in a limited number of data points. The error motions of an assembled machine tool or metrology instrument can also be measured using conventional methods, but the contribution due to the <b>slideway</b> flatness is difficult to determine directly. A prototype grazing incidence interferometer capable of performing these measurements has been designed, built and tested at Tropel. Results of measurements of a variety of surfaces are given in order to illustrate the prototype instrument’s capabilities. In particular, the results of measurements from a machine tool <b>slideway</b> and a granite surface plate are provided. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{deterministic}} structuring of {{a surface}} {{is having a}} profound effect on many industrial products by allowing the manufacturer to significantly alter the way in which a surface functions. This has led to a clear need in industry and academia for traceable areal surface texture measurements. To address this need traceable transfer artefacts and primary instrumentation are required. The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) is working on two projects – one to develop areal transfer artefacts and one to develop a traceable areal surface texture measuring instrument. The authors describe the development of the artefacts and instrument, and present some of the challenges that are still required to be able to offer an areal traceability measurement service to industry. The instrument has a working volume of 8 mm × 8 mm × 0. 1 mm and uses a co-planar air-bearing <b>slideway</b> to move the sample. It also uses a novel vertical displacement measuring probe, incorporating an air-bearing and an electromagnetic force control mechanism. The motions of the <b>slideway</b> and the probe are measured by laser interferometers thus ensuring traceability of the measurements to the definition of the metre. The artefacts were manufactured using a range of machining technologies and in a range of geometries suitable for stylus and optical based instruments...|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of rockfall impact force {{is crucial in}} designing protection measures. In the present study, laboratory tests are carried out by testing the weight {{and shape of the}} falling rock fragments, drop height, incident angle, platform on the <b>slideway,</b> and cushion layer on the protection measures to investigate their influences on the impact force. The test results indicate that the impact force is positively exponential to the weight of rockfall and the instantaneous impact velocity of the rockfall approaching the protection measures. The impact velocity is found to be dominated not only by the drop height but also by the shape of rockfall and the length of the platform on the <b>slideway.</b> A great drop height and/or a short platform produces a fast impact velocity. Spherical rockfalls experience a greater impact velocity than cubes and elongated cuboids. A layer of cushion on the protection measures may reduce the impact force to a greater extent. The reduction effects are dominated by the cushion material and the thickness of the cushion layer. The thicker the cushion layer, the greater the reduction effect and the less the impact force. The stiffer the buffer material, the lower the buffering effect and the greater the impact force. The present study indicates that the current standard in China for designing protection measures may overestimate the impact force by not taking into consideration the rockfall shape, platform, and cushion layer...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of ‘stick-slip ’ oscillations of the feed drives of machine tools {{is an important}} problem {{in the design of}} certain types of machine tools. The factors contributing to this particular type of instability are studied both experimentally and analytically {{with the aid of a}} simple model based on dynamic measurements. The experimental work is restricted to a scraped cast iron-cup ground cast iron <b>slideway</b> interface. The principal experimental variables are lubricant viscosity and the natural frequency of the drive. The dynamic observations provide evidence and data that enable the use of a simple model rather than the more usual appli-cation of an involved analysis. The consideration of analytical and experimental results allows further under-standing of the mechanism of feed drive instability to be developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of a long-range tunneling profilometer based on a ''Nanostep'' <b>slideway</b> is reported. This profilometer has potential capability of measuring surface profiles over a complete traverse of 50 mm horizontally and 15 mum vertically. Its characteristics have been investigated over both long and short scanning ranges. Results are presented {{of a series of}} repeat measurements over 1. 4 -mm traces on a gold-coated silicon wafer. A repeatability of better than 0. 2 nm is obtained and surface features of a few nanometers have been resolved laterally. Anomalies in the characteristic of tunneling current with the bias voltage are discussed in terms of surface contaminants and physical contact between tip and sample. Some problems in the application of STM in nanometric metrology are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|Hysteretic {{behavior}} {{in the direction of}} sliding is investigated for kinematically constrained slideways, using a special system produced to study the limits of performance of thin-film polymer on glass bearings. A typical configuration for a superprecision instrument <b>slideway</b> using PTFE pads and a Zerodur counterface is shown to exhibit around 200 -nm sliding hysteresis. Moreover, this value is strongly dependent on the total load on the bearing system. The pattern of dependence is consistent with an established model of contact under oblique forces, although the materials conditions at the interface are much more complex than those assumed in that model. Full isolation of these properties is not possible with the present experiments, but they indicate that die shear modulus of the interface layer is more than ten times greater than that of bulk polymer.

As an example, {{the design and}} construction technology of the anti-ship collision suspended steel cofferdam in Shanghai Changjiang River Bridge has been discussed. Design analysis shows that: by using the anti-ship collision suspended steel cofferdam the bridge pier can be protected and adopted lots of collision energy. At the same time, the collision injury degree of the vessel could be reduced. By using the finite element method, the deformation and strain state under the stage of construction and floating-transportation had been analyzed. Considering both the anti-ship collision and the construction, the anti-ship collision suspended steel cofferdam has been designed. In construction stage, the following methods had been developed: the integrally manufacturing method in factory, launching method to river in <b>slideway,</b> fioating-transportion method to the pier position in long distance and set-to-place method by synchronous lifting of two floating cranes.

40|$|Expressions for the {{load-carrying}} capacity, {{stiffness and}} damping rate of pressurized oil film bearings are derived and {{expressed in terms}} of the variables available to the designer. By adding a simple automatic flow valve, operated by pressure feed-back, the pressurized oil film exhibits infinite stiffness to steady normal loads. The method can be adapted for a system, embodying pilot pad control of a main bearing pad, in which the pilot pad slides on a flat strip and the film thickness of the main pad is varied to compensate for undulations in the main <b>slideway.</b> A further experimental and theoretical investigation is described in which feed-back control is used to support concentrically the shaft of a journal bearing. With a shaft diameter of 2 in. and a radial clearance of 0, 002 in. the eccentricity is generally not greater than 2 x 10 - 5 in., as inferred from the pressure measurements, for loads exceeding 300 Ib and rotational speeds up to 1200 rev/&. It is argued that much greater loads and higher rotational speeds can be attained with virtually no eccentricity. NOTATIO...|$|E
30|$|An S-lay crane barge, named CNOOC 201, {{has been}} built for pipe laying in {{deepwater}} oil/gas fields in the South China Sea. It is due to be commissioned {{by the end of}} the year 2010. A special lifting system is developed to meet the challenge that installing deepwater risers from an S-lay barge is difficult and has not been achieved. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the model test on such an innovative system, which has to be done before field application. By applying the similarity theory, the movement of the S-lay barge is simulated through a six degrees-of-freedom motion platform, and a truncated model riser is utilized for the model testing. The displacement and force boundary conditions at the truncated position of the riser are obtained from the catenary governing equation and become realized by a <b>slideway</b> cart and a loading system designed to control the configuration of the model riser, which presents a similar configuration to a real riser in deepwater. The test results are in very good agreement with theoretical calculations, showing that the active truncated test is applicable for controlling the configuration of the deepwater riser in model testing investigation.|$|E

Particularly, in order to undertake micro-milling of optical glasses or other hard-machining materials, vibration assisted machining techniques have been adopted. However, it is essential and much needed to undertake such processes based on a scientific approach, i. e. the process to be quantitatively controlled and optimized rather than carried out with a trial-and-error manner. In this research, theoretical modelling and instrumental implementation issues for vibration assisted micro-milling are presented and explored in depth. The modelling is focused on establishing the scientific relationship between the process variables such as vibration frequency, vibration amplitude, feedrate and spindle speed while taking into account machine dynamics effect and the outcomes such as surface roughness generated, tool wear and material removal rate in the process. The machine dynamics has been investigated including a static analysis, machine tool-loop stiffness, modal analysis, frequency response function, etc, carried out for both the machine structure and the piezo-actuator device. The instrumentation implementation mainly includes the design of the desktop vibration assisted machining system and its control system. The machining system consists of a piezo-driven XY stage, air bearing spindle, jig, workpiece holder, PI <b>slideway,</b> manual <b>slideway</b> and solid metal table to improve the system stability.

40|$|More {{and more}} high rising {{buildings}} emerged in modern cities, but emergency evacuation of tall buildings {{has been a}} worldwide difficult problem. In this paper, a new evacuation device for high rising buildings in fire accident was proposed and studied. This device mainly consisted of special spiral <b>slideway</b> and shunt valve. People in this device could fast slide down {{to the first floor}} under gravity without any electric power and physical strength, which is suitable for various emergency evacuation including mobility-impaired persons. The plane simulation test has shown that human being in alternative clockwise and counterclockwise movement will not become dizzy. The evacuated people should wear protection pad, which can prevent slider from being injured by surface friction with the slide, and eliminate the friction coefficient difference caused by different clothes and slide surface. The calculation results show that the evacuation speed of the new device is much faster than traditional staircases. Moreover, such new evacuation device can also be used as a means of vertical transportation in high-rise buildings partly. People can take it from any floor to ground floor directly, which not only save time for waiting for the lifts but also save the power. The new evacuation system is of simple structure, easy to use, and suitable for evacuation and partly used as vertical downwards traffic, which shows light on solving world-wide difficulties on fast evacuation in high-rise buildings...|$|E
40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis {{was carried out in}} the School of Engineering Science, University of Warwick, between October 1984 and October 1987. Chapter 1 contains a review of recent developments in instrumentation that require both manipulation and measurement over the range 0. 1 - 100 nm. The instruments considered are the Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM), Stylus techniques, X-ray interferometry and x-ray microscopy. The rest of the thesis presents the design and assessment of a novel STM incorporating an X-ray interferometer, an ultra-high precision stylus measuring instrument and an x-ray microscope two axis specimen translation stage. Chapters 2 and 3 present an assessment of different mechanisms for the production of rectilinear motions having parasitic errors of better than mm. Theoretical and experimental investigations into monolithic parallel spring systems based on a notch type hinge and long range slideways based on a polymeric bearing sliding on a polished glass prism are presented. Optimisation of a soleniod magnet force transducer is presented as a drive technique for the former device, whilst a mechanically non-influencing feedscrew drive is described for the latter system. A stylus based measuring instrument, called "Nanosurf 2 ", that incorporates the polymeric <b>slideway</b> is presented in chapter 4. The performance of this system has been assessed and the results are presented in the following chapter. The linearity and accuracy of an electromagnetically driven, single crystal silicon, monolithic spring make it a suitable for use as the translation mechanism in a Scanning Tunnelling Microscope. Consequently, a three-axis spring has been constructed to generate the translations required for imaging. An X-ray interferometer is built into the probe axis to facilitate absolute calibration. This work is preceeded by an investigation into the generation of complex shapes in this brittle material. Finally, the current status of this work is reported with the presentation of initial experimental results...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel <b>slideway</b> bearing design comprised of a thin-film (0. 1 mm- 0. 2 mm) of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) bound to a rigid hemispherical substrate. Two prototype bearing designs were fabricated and tested {{to characterize the}} coefficient of friction (dynamic and static) and wear of the polymer. In addition, similar bearings were incorporated into a kinematically constrained rectilinear carriage to determine the repeatability of motion during multiple traverses. The first bearing had a radius of curvature {{on the order of}} 2. 38 mm incorporating an UHMWPE film thickness between 0. 1 mm and 0. 2 mm. The friction coefficient was measured to be between 0. 155 and 0. 189 for normal loads of 11. 5 N and 2. 2 N, respectively at a surface speed of 4. 2 mm {center_dot} s{sup - 1 }. This bearing failed after a traverse of approximately 700 m at a load of 11. 5 N. A similar evaluation procedure was carried out on a bearing of radius 6. 35 mm resulting in a friction coefficient between 0. 125 and 0. 185 at loads of 27. 8 N and 2. 2 N, respectively, and the bearing endured a traverse of over 2. 2 km at a load of approximately 28 N (in both air and vacuum conditions) with a surface speed of 4. 2 mm {center_dot} s{sup - 1 }. The second bearing prototype was further subjected to a repeatability test. In this setup, a carriage incorporating five bearings was traversed in a nominally linear path while vertical deviations for multiple traverses were measured by a custom built displacement sensor. Deviations from a linear path were observed to repeat to within a few nanometers about nominal variations of less than 10 nm for a traverse distance of 10 mm. This system and other subsystems used to characterize the friction coefficient and noise of the polymer bearing are presented...|$|E
