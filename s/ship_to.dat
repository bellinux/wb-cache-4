5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during a voyage and creates extra space between {{the top of the}} cargo and the top of the hold. Cargo is then free to move {{from one side of the}} <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the <b>ship</b> <b>to</b> list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E
