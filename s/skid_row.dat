5|$|Glam {{metal can}} be traced back to music acts like Alice Cooper, Cheap Trick, Kiss, The New York Dolls, and Van Halen. It arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States, {{particularly}} on the Los Angeles Sunset Strip music scene, pioneered by bands such as Mötley Crüe, Ratt, Quiet Riot, Stryper, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi, and Dokken. It was popular throughout the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, bringing to prominence bands including Poison, <b>Skid</b> <b>Row,</b> Cinderella, and Warrant. Glam metal was associated with flashy clothing and makeup. Poison, for example, had long shaggy or backcombed hair, accessories, metal studs, leather, and make-up during their live performances.|$|E
5|$|After {{almost three}} years of touring to promote the album Metallica, {{including}} a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus {{in the summer of}} 1995 and played three outdoor shows that included headlining at Donington Park, where it was supported by Slayer, <b>Skid</b> <b>Row,</b> Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The short tour was titled Escape from the Studio '95. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number one album. The cover art of Load, called Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; band members' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza in mid-1996.|$|E

25|$|Sebastian Bach was {{introduced}} to <b>Skid</b> <b>Row</b> by Dave Feld, {{a friend of the}} band, who saw Bach singing Led Zeppelin covers at rock photographer Mark Weiss wedding. After completing the lineup, the group signed with Richie Sambora's and Bon Jovi's publishing company Underground, unknowingly giving them the lion’s share of the group’s royalties. <b>Skid</b> <b>Row</b> later restored Sambora's share of the royalties, but Bon Jovi kept his, which caused a rift between Bon Jovi and Bach. After negotiating with a number of labels such Geffen, Atlantic, and A, <b>Skid</b> <b>Row</b> settled on Atlantic in 1988. The band entered the Royal Recorders in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin with producer Michael Wagener to record its debut. The studio was in the back end of the hotel the band stayed in. <b>Skid</b> <b>Row</b> worked according to a schedule made by Wagener and stayed dry during recording. The recording went smoothly because the band had been performing the songs for a year. The label initially pressed 150,000 copies of the album and booked the band an opening slot on Bon Jovi's 1988–1989 New Jersey Syndicate Tour.|$|E
5000|$|... "Under the Skin" [...] was {{released}} August 12, 2003 and features a {{behind the scenes}} look at the making of <b>Skid</b> <b>Row's</b> comeback album Thickskin. Set in a documentary style the DVD also includes a photo gallery, interviews, music videos and live performances.|$|R

Even though they have severe problems, they maintain fairly good employment stability and stability in marriage. Yet they steadily deteriorate...|$|R
5000|$|The {{band members}} {{have stated that}} [...] "Love Bites" [...] was {{influenced}} by their cover of <b>Skid</b> <b>Row's</b> song Slave to the Grind and Lamb of God. Lzzy Hale also mentioned on an episode of That Metal Show that thrash metal bands like Megadeth and Anthrax were influences for the song.|$|R
25|$|<b>Skid</b> <b>Row</b> {{was formed}} 1986 in Toms River, New Jersey when guitarist Dave Sabo met bassist Rachel Bolan {{in a local}} guitar store Sabo was working at. They both shared similar music {{influences}} and soon began rehearsing at Bolan family’s garage. Guitarist Scotti Hill came from Bolan's previous club band, and Sabo's acquaintance Rob Affuso played drums in a Rush tribute band. Once the band was formed, <b>Skid</b> <b>Row</b> started gigging in nightclubs throughout the Eastern United States and quickly built a small following. Sabo was a childhood friend of Jon Bon Jovi and they had agreed {{if one of them}} succeeded in the music business, he would help the other out. <b>Skid</b> <b>Row</b> caught the attention of Bon Jovi's manager Doc McGhee while opening for Bon Jovi on his 1987 Slippery When Wet Tour. McGhee suggested the band to replace original singer Matt Fallon because he lacked the rest of the group’s drive.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2006 {{a number}} of <b>Skid</b> <b>Row</b> and Orphanage demo tapes {{featuring}} Phil Lynott were discovered. These were his earliest recordings and had been presumed lost for decades.|$|E

5000|$|The {{film was}} quickly made {{in just over}} 30 days from March to mid-April 1989. The concert scenes for the finale and Eddie's big return onstage were filmed on April 24, 1989 in Las Vegas Paradise, Nevada at the Thomas & Mack Center in between sets of Bon Jovi's {{headlining}} [...] "New Jersey" [...] tour (after <b>Skid</b> <b>Row's</b> opening set) concert.|$|R
5000|$|The concert {{starts with}} the Motörhead classic [...] "Ace of Spades", and the band enjoys {{complete}} comfort on stage as they head into AC/DC's [...] "T.N.T.", <b>Skid</b> <b>Row's</b> [...] "Youth Gone Wild", and Anthrax's [...] "Only". They also perform [...] "Punishment", the song they feared so much, but in retrospect, all of them confess that {{it was probably the}} tightest song during the whole set.|$|R
25|$|Fahrenheit (stylized ºFahrenheit) was a {{hard rock}} band from Santiago, Chile, deeply {{influenced}} by 1980s and '70s rock legends such us Aerosmith, Mötley Crüe and <b>Skid</b> <b>Row.</b> ºFahrenheit were {{well known in the}} Latin-American rock scene for its intense on-stage performance, energetic sound and killer guitar solos.|$|E

In March 2014, Efron engaged {{in a fight with}} a homeless man in <b>Skid</b> <b>Row.</b> Law enforcement officials did not make any arrests because they viewed it as mutual combat.|$|E
50|$|Downtown {{development}} {{business interests}} and the Central City Association (CCA) came out against the compromise. On September 20, 2006, Los Angeles City Council voted to reject the compromise. On October 3, 2006, police arrested <b>Skid</b> <b>Row's</b> transients for sleeping on the streets {{for the first time}} in months. On October 10, 2006, under pressure from the ACLU, the city tacitly agreed to the compromise by declining to appeal the court's decision.|$|R
50|$|The South Loop was {{historically}} home to vice districts, {{including the}} brothels, bars, burlesque theaters, and arcades. Inexpensive residential hotels on Van Buren and State Street made {{it one of}} the city's <b>Skid</b> <b>Rows</b> until the 1970s. One of the largest homeless shelters in the city, the Pacific Garden Mission, was located at State and Balbo from 1923 to 2007, when it moved to 1458 S. Canal St.|$|R
50|$|While not a {{fundamental}} {{departure from the}} band's brand of melodic hard rock, Dog Eat Dog exhibited a heavier and darker sound than that found {{on the first two}} Warrant records, creating a style similar to <b>Skid</b> <b>Row's</b> Slave to the Grind. Parts of the record are ambitious and experimental, blending Hard Rock, progressive metal and alternative rock elements. The album was, above all, a showcase for the songwriting talents of vocalist Jani Lane.|$|R

25|$|The Times also {{embarked}} {{on a number of}} investigative journalism pieces. A series in December 2004 on the King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles led to a Pulitzer Prize and a more thorough coverage of the hospital's troubled history. Lopez wrote a five-part series on the civic and humanitarian disgrace of Los Angeles' <b>Skid</b> <b>Row,</b> which became the focus of a 2009 motion picture, The Soloist. It also won 62 awards at the SND awards.|$|E
25|$|Bonham starred with Ted Nugent, Evan Seinfeld (Biohazard), Sebastian Bach (<b>Skid</b> <b>Row),</b> and Scott Ian (Anthrax) on the VH1 reality {{television}} show, Supergroup, in May 2006.

The song [...] "Warlord" [...] was later renamed [...] "Endless War," [...] and is on the Dreams of Endless War album.|$|R
5000|$|Erik first {{auditioned for}} Swedish Idol in 2007, {{but he did}} not reach the final auditions at that time. In 2009, he came back, and made quite an {{impression}} on the jury who reacted with a mix of crying and laughing after his audition singing <b>Skid</b> <b>Row's</b> [...] "18 and Life". Erik performed several rock songs during the show; Kiss - “Shout It Out Loud”, Iron Maiden - “Run To The Hills” and Queen - “The Show Must Go On”.|$|R
5000|$|Faster Pussycat {{were signed}} to Elektra Records and sold over 500,000 copies of 1989's Wake Me When It's Over. They toured with Y&T, Ace Frehley, Alice Cooper, Mötley Crüe, KISS, David Lee Roth, and others. Their next album Whipped!, {{released}} in 1992, faced the surging popularity of alternative rock and was less popular. The band broke up that year, with Taime moving to Chicago {{to work with}} Pigface. Taime also sang backing vocals on <b>Skid</b> <b>Row's</b> 1995 cover of the Ramones' [...] "Psycho Therapy".|$|R
25|$|The {{stranger}} {{was never}} solidly identified. He was variously identified {{by parents and}} friends as a host of men, including Al Watson, John Barrett, Earl Keesee and Joseph Ahrens; the coroner joked about {{the inability of the}} man to stay identified. Investigators considered the most credible possibilities as Barrett, a former Canadian Soldier who disappeared from Chicago's <b>skid</b> <b>row</b> that same day, or Eddie Ryan, whose mother was a homeless washerwoman named Nellie Ryan who had given him years earlier to a farmer to raise and then identified his body.|$|E
25|$|The song {{began to}} get airplay in the New York area, then other sister {{stations}} in major markets picked up the song. In March 1983, Bon Jovi called David Bryan, who in turn called bassist Alec John Such and an experienced drummer named Tico Torres, both formerly of the band Phantom's Opera. Tapped to play lead guitar was Bon Jovi's neighbor, Dave Sabo ("The Snake"), though he never officially joined the band. He and Jon promised each other that whoever made it first, would help out the other. Sabo later went on to form the group <b>Skid</b> <b>Row.</b> Jon saw and was impressed with hometown guitarist Richie Sambora who was recommended by fellow bassist Alec John Such and drummer Tico Torres. Sambora had toured with Joe Cocker, played with a group called Mercy and had been called up to audition for Kiss. He also played on the album Lessons with the band Message which, was re-released on CD through Long Island Records in 1995 and fellow bassist Alec John Such was also the bassist for the band. Message was originally signed to Led Zeppelin's Swan Song Records label, although the album was never released.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in September 2013, the LAPD {{started a}} trial {{program for the}} use of body worn cameras with 30 {{officers}} in the <b>Skid</b> <b>Row</b> area. Reports from the trial program indicated that the cameras functioned well and that they assisted in deescalating situations although there were some technical issues with the cameras along with slight issues with the cameras falling off of officers during movement. In November 2014 in a sign of body camera purchases to come, the department chose Taser International as the vendor for body cameras to be used by the LAPD after their use in the trial program earlier in the year. On December 16, 2014 Mayor Eric Garcetti announced that the city would purchase 7,000 body worn cameras from Taser for use by the department. Patrol officers will be equipped with the cameras which will be purchased in the next fiscal year in order to outfit all patrol officers by the expected completion date in June 2016. 700 of the cameras will first be deployed to patrol officers in the Central, Mission and Newton patrol areas of the city beginning in January 2015. $1.55 million was raised from private donors to start the body camera program for the initial rollout phase in order to ease budget constraints for the city with another $1 million coming from the National Institute of Justice, a branch of the Department of Justice. In total, the body cameras will most likely cost less than $10 million and will be included in Garcetti's proposed fiscal year 2016 budget. Before all of the cameras are deployed to patrol officers, the Police Commission will create a policy that governs the use of the cameras and video footage while consulting with department and city officials along with outside organizations including other departments who already use body cameras. While the commission has not created a policy yet as of December 2014, several guidelines were already outlined by the Mayor including that officers would have to turn on the cameras whenever they arrest or detain someone for interrogation, but many public interactions such as domestic violence interviews would not be recorded. The cameras may also be turned off in situations where police use deadly force. Prior to the rollout of any body worn cameras, officers were able to carry personally owned audio recording devices starting in 1994 if they file an application and obtain the requisite permission.|$|E
50|$|Before exhibiting in the streets, Peterson {{exhibited}} paper paintings (1976) {{and wall}} drawings (1978) at Newspace in Los Angeles. Peterson’s 1977 sculpture show at Newspace featured brightly-colored, geometric, cage-like structures alluding to those absent bodies {{that would later}} occupy his bum (bad) shelters. Inspired by neighboring artists’ anonymous interventions in the street, as well as <b>skid</b> <b>row's</b> homeless occupants, he constructed Masonite and Fiberglass single-body shelters in his studio, which he inserted amidst downtown’s craggy terrain. In 1979, he exhibited photomontages documenting each shelter's installation, occupation and use, in editions of 10, so as to finance their demand.|$|R
5000|$|Placing {{the song}} after another track (usually, but not necessarily, the last track on the album), {{following}} {{a long period}} of silence. For example, Nirvana's song [...] "Endless, Nameless" [...] was included as a hidden track in this way on their 1991 CD Nevermind, after 10 minutes of complete silence. Although it was not the first hidden track to use this technique, this hidden song gained significant attention. <b>Skid</b> <b>Row's</b> third studio release, Subhuman Race, contains an untitled 0:40 hidden track {{at the end of the}} song [...] "Ironwill", which ends at 4:45 followed by 2:15 of silence before the hidden song plays.|$|R
5000|$|In 1989 Ciaron left Brisbane {{to go to}} the USA to work in {{soup kitchens}} and <b>skid</b> <b>rows.</b> In 1990 he moved to Washington, DC into a Trinitarian-run home, where he helped give support and shelter to {{homeless}} women and children. Here he practiced nonviolent witness against the White House. He spent four years in the United States from 1989 to 1993 and was mentored by the well-known Catholic activists, Daniel Berrigan and his brother Philip. He was there for the invasion of Panama and first Gulf War and attended nonviolent demonstrations at the Pentagon on a weekly basis. He witnessed and met young people deployed in the US army, navy and the National Guard, including women who were deployed to fight despite having recently given birth.|$|R
