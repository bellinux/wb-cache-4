The vehicle also has a regenerative braking system. The electrical power from the generator is sent primarily to the electric motor, with the excess going to the batteries, depending on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> (SOC) of the battery pack and the power demanded at the wheels.|$|E

25|$|Charge-sustaining mode {{is used by}} {{production}} hybrid vehicles (HEVs) today, and {{combines the}} operation of the vehicle's two power sources in such a manner that the vehicle is operating as efficiently as possible without allowing the battery <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> to move outside a predetermined narrow band. Over the course of a trip in a HEV the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> may fluctuate but will have no net change. The battery in a HEV can thus be thought of as an energy accumulator rather than a fuel storage device. Once a plug-in hybrid has exhausted its all-electric range in charge-depleting mode, it can switch into charge-sustaining mode automatically.|$|E

25|$|The Second Generation Prius {{contains}} a 1.310kWh battery, composed of 28 modules. Each battery module {{is made of}} 6 individual 1.2V 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells in series forming a 7.2V 6.5Ah module with 46Wh/kg energy density and 1.3kW/kg output power density. Each module {{contains a}}n integrated charge controller and relay. These modules are connected 28 in series to form a 201.6V 6.5Ah battery (traction battery), {{also known as the}} energy storage system. The computer controlled charge controller and battery management computer systems keep this battery between 38% and 82% <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge,</b> with a tendency to keep the average <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> around 60%. By shallow cycling the battery {{only a small portion of}} its net available energy storage capacity is available for use (approximately 400Wh) by the hybrid drive system, but the shallow computer controlled cycling dramatically improves the cycle life, thermal management control, and net long term calendar life of the battery. Active cooling of this battery is achieved by a blower motor and air ducting, while passive thermal management was accomplished through the metal case design.|$|E
25|$|The Prius Plug-in {{has three}} drive modes, all-electric (EV), and two hybrid modes: Eco and Power. The EV mode is user-selectable and when running in this mode the hybrid {{engine control unit}} (ECU) {{operates}} the vehicle using only the larger motor-generator (MG2) if pre-determined parameters are satisfied, such as sufficient battery <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> (SOC) and vehicle speed within EV mode range. The Eco mode is designed to maximize fuel savings for any driving conditions, and modifies or smoothes out the electronic throttle control program to reduce throttle response, reducing the throttle opening {{to a maximum of}} 11.6%, and also modifies the operation of the air conditioning system. As an additional benefit, the Eco mode improves performance in low-traction conditions because the reduced output helps to minimize wheel skidding such as those caused by ice and snow. Power mode increases throttle response in the middle range more than normal.|$|E
500|$|While {{operating}} modes are switched automatically the Volt {{allows the}} driver to choose from three drive modes: normal, sport and mountain. The mountain mode, {{which is expected to}} be required only under unusual power demand conditions, increases minimum battery <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> (SOC) to around 45%, thus maintaining performance on steep and long grades. The driver will hear more engine noise due to the higher rate of power generation required to maintain this mode. The sport mode causes the engine to rev higher, and the response to the throttle pedal is quicker. The Ampera has an additional option, the [...] "City Mode" [...] or [...] "battery hold", allowing {{the driver to}} save the energy currently stored in the battery for use when traveling in urban areas or restricted zones. The 2013 model year Volt includes a [...] "Hold" [...] option to provide the same choice.|$|E

500|$|For the 2011/2012 model years, {{the battery}} pack stores [...] of energy {{but it is}} {{controlled}} or buffered via the energy management system to use only [...] of this capacity to maximize {{the life of the}} pack. For this reason the battery pack never fully charges or depletes, as the software only allows the battery to operate within a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> (SOC) window of 65%, after which the engine kicks in and maintains the charge near the lower level. The minimum SOC varies depending on operating conditions. When more power is required, such as mountain mode, the lower limit of the SOC will rise to 45% to ensure there is enough power available. The battery capacity was increased to [...] for the 2013 model year, the SOC window will be increased to use [...] of the total battery energy, and the buffer to ensure battery life will not be reduced. These changes will increase the Volt's all-electric range but charging will take slightly longer. The improved battery performance and durability were achieved through minor changes to the material composition of the battery cell chemistry.|$|E
500|$|Most of the Volt initial design {{parameters}} defined {{for the development}} of the concept car, then referred as the [...] "iCar" [...] in homage to the iPod, were kept throughout the process up to the final production version. A key design parameter was a target of [...] for the all-electric range, selected to keep the battery size small and lower costs, and mainly because research showed that in the U.S. 78 percent of daily commuters travel 40 miles or less. This target range would allow most travel to be accomplished electrically driven and the assumption was made that charging will take place at home overnight. This requirement translated using a lithium-ion battery pack with an energy storage capacity of 16 [...] considering that the battery would be used until the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> (SOC) of the battery reached 30%.

500|$|After {{the concept}} was put into the {{pipeline}} for production, General Motors began looking for a partner to develop the Volt's lithium-ion battery pack. The carmaker evaluated about twenty-five different battery cell chemistries and constructions from around two dozen lithium-ion battery makers around the world. Due to their more promising cell technologies, two companies were selected in June 2007, Compact Power (CPI), which uses a lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) cell made by its parent company, LG Chemical; and Continental Automotive Systems, which uses lithium iron phosphate based cylindrical cells made by A123Systems. By the end of October 2007 CPI (LG Chem) delivered their finished battery pack prototypes, and A123 delivered theirs by January 2008. General Motors testing process was conducted at the laboratory the carmaker had created for the GM EV1 program. The battery packs included monitoring systems designed to keep the batteries cool and operating at optimum capacity despite {{a wide range of}} ambient temperatures. In order to make sure the battery pack would last ten years and [...] expected for the battery warranty, the Volt team decided to use only half of the 16 [...] capacity to reduce the rate of capacity degradation, limiting the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> (SOC) up to 80% of capacity and never depleting the battery below 30%. General Motors also was expecting the battery could withstand 5,000 full discharges without losing more than 10% of its charge capacity. According to GM, , no batteries have been changed due to degradation.|$|E

2500|$|To measure resistance, {{switches}} {{arrange for}} a small battery within the instrument to pass a current through the device under test and the meter coil. Since the current available depends on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> of the battery which changes over time, a multimeter usually has an adjustment for the ohms scale to zero it. In the usual circuits found in analog multimeters, the meter deflection is inversely proportional to the resistance, so full-scale will be 0ohms, and higher resistance will correspond to smaller deflections. [...] The ohms scale is compressed, so resolution is better at lower resistance values.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{generation}} Toyota Prius {{makes use of}} a 201.6-volt NiMH battery composed of 28 modules, where each module is made of six individual 1.2-volt, 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells.
