Will is <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> and overwhelmed that he falls {{down in the middle of}} the school hallway (close to the same position as the front cover of Bowie's Lodger album). The last scene takes place during Charlotte's graduation ceremony where Will and Sa5m are confirmed as dating.|$|E

25|$|David Sutcliffe, 30, was a {{law student}} at the University of Colorado at Boulder who was interning at Pettit & Martin for the summer.

25|$|Malahat {{became a}} lumber {{schooner}} once again after Prohibition ended. In 1934, Gordon Gibson, Sr. {{and his brother}} were <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> to discover Malahat up for sale for only $2,500 that they bought her on the spot. She {{was used as a}} self-propelled log barge, carrying Sitka spruce from the Queen Charlotte Islands to the booming ground at the Powell River in Teakerne Arm in Desolation Sound. Because the Malahat required a crew of fifteen, one of the challenges for a local lumbering operation was assembling a crew with experience in seamanship as well as logging.|$|E

25|$|In {{the defence}} {{of a lawsuit}} {{initiated}} against him in 1948, he found himself actually researching and providing detailed instructions to his defence attorney (lawyer) to fight the case in court. When the case was finally decided in his favour, he was <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> about the outcome {{that he decided to}} change career and enter the legal profession. He therefore applied and gained admission into the famous London School of Economics (LSE) to study law. He departed from the shores of Nigeria in December 1949 on board an ocean liner sailing along the westbound coast of Africa to the UK. He took and passed the LLB (Bachelor of Laws) in June 1952. He passed the English Bar exams, and almost immediately was invited to the Bar association (Inner Temple). He was in fact the first Ijesha man called to the English Bar.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the omer count (i.e. the Sefirat HaOmer), as {{enumerated}} in the Midrash Rabba Parashas Emor, explains that when the Children of Israel left ancient Egypt they were told by Moses that 49 days after the Exodus, they would be given the Torah. The populace was <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> {{at the prospect of}} a spiritual liberation, following the physical emancipation from Egypt, they kept a count of the passing days that ended with the giving of the Torah at the foot of Mount Sinai. The Torah itself, in , and , states that it is a commandment to count seven complete weeks from the day after Passover night ending with the festival of Shavuot on the fiftieth day. Shavuot is the festival marking the giving of the Torah to the Hebrew nation on the 6th of the Hebrew month of Sivan.|$|E
25|$|Newton's tract De motu corporum in gyrum, {{which he}} sent to Halley in late 1684, derived what are {{now known as the}} three laws of Kepler, {{assuming}} an inverse square law of force, and generalised the result to conic sections. It also extended the methodology by adding the solution of a problem on the motion of a body through a resisting medium. The contents of De motu <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> Halley by their mathematical and physical originality and far-reaching implications for astronomical theory, that he immediately went to visit Newton again, in November 1684, to ask Newton to let the Royal Society have more of such work. The results of their meetings clearly helped to stimulate Newton with the enthusiasm needed to take his investigations of mathematical problems much further in this area of physical science, and he did so in a period of highly concentrated work that lasted at least until mid-1686.|$|E

25|$|Despite his age, Moore again {{played for}} the state when George Parr's team toured Australia during the 1863–64 season, opening the bowling with Nat Thomson. With New South Wales fielding 18 players, the match was not accorded {{first-class}} status, although Moore took four wickets in the English team's first innings. Moore did not make his first-class debut until March 1870, when {{at the age of}} 50 years and 325 days he played against Victoria in an intercolonial match at the Albert Ground, Sydney. Coming in last in the batting order, he scored eight not out in a 33-run partnership with Charles Bannerman (also on debut), which enabled New South Wales to reach 200 runs {{for the first time in}} intercolonial matches. This achievement <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> their teammates that they were carried off the ground on their shoulders. Moore went on to play two further first-class matches, both against Victoria, with his best bowling figures, 6/56, coming during the 1871–72 season, in a match New South Wales lost by an innings and 26 runs. In recognition of his performance at the match, he was presented with the match ball mounted on a silver stand.|$|E
25|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Deaf Havana {{spent a lot of time}} touring as a support band; they would not play a {{headline}} tour until April 2012, 5 months after {{the release of}} Fools and Worthless Liars. They began by supporting Skindred on their headline tour across Europe, followed by acting as support, alongside Tek-One, to Architects on their UK tour. Speaking before their April 2012 headline tour, which featured The Swellers and The Dangerous Summer as support, James Veck-Gilodi said: 'We are <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> to finally get out on the road and headline again. We've spent the last year or so writing and recording the album and been lucky enough to have some amazing support shows... but to be able to go out and play songs from Fools and Worthless Liars and headline is going to be great'. The band are due to play another headline tour, at larger venues, in November 2012. Support will come from There For Tomorrow and Canterbury. Deaf Havana had been due to travel to the USA to support There For Tomorrow in September 2012, but due to a problem with the arrival of their visas, this did not take place.|$|E
25|$|In August 1989, Ethel meets a {{new love}} {{interest}} named Reggie Thompson (John Rutland). He invites {{her to go}} on a coach trip to Clacton for a dancing competition. Ethel is <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> that she shows Reggie a saucy nightie she has bought for the trip. When Dot, Marge Green (Pat Coombs) and Mo Butcher (Edna Doré) find out about the trip, they decide to go as well. Reggie arranges dancing partners for them and the ladies practise hard at the community centre for months before the trip. But upon arriving on holiday, Ethel grows disappointed in Reggie when he starts to show interest in another woman named Gladys. On the night of the dancing competition, Ethel finds that Reggie has run off with Gladys and she has no partner in the grand ballroom except for her 'little Willy'. In 1992, Ethel's adored pug Willy succumbs to old-age and she has to make the heart-breaking decision to put him down. Regulars at The Queen Victoria pub raise money to buy Ethel a new dog, but she refuses to accept it, saying Willy is irreplaceable. By the mid 1990s Ethel is seen much less frequently. She is seen occasionally however, usually when a big event is occurring or to celebrate Christmas and New Year with her old friends on the Square. After 1997 Ethel is not seen in Walford for three years, although she is mentioned often, particularly by Dot, who will often visit her off-screen in her sheltered housing.|$|E
