5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or <b>social</b> <b>influence,</b> the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the observational implications of <b>social</b> <b>influences</b> on adoption decisions for {{an environment of}} perfect foresight adopters. We argue that <b>social</b> <b>influences</b> can produce two observable effects: 1) discontinuities in unconditional adoption curves and 2) pattern reversals in conditional adoption curves, in which earlier adoption is found for one group of actors versus another when "fundamentals" suggest the reverse ordering should occur; in turn the presence of either of these features can, under weak assumptions, be interpreted as evidence of <b>social</b> <b>influences.</b> As such, these properties are robust implications of social effects. ...|$|R

40|$|Previous meta-analytic {{studies of}} {{universal}} school-based drug education program evaluations {{have found that}} interactive programs are more effective than non-interactive programs and that within the group of more effective interactive programs, Comprehensive Life Skills programs are more effective overall than <b>Social</b> <b>Influences</b> programs. This study builds upon those earlier meta-analytic studies of universal school-based drug education program evaluations by examining the relative effectiveness of Comprehensive Life Skills programs and <b>Social</b> <b>Influences</b> programs on the use and/or abuse of different substances at different grade levels. We find the previous findings about the superiority of Comprehensive Life Skills programs appear to be true at the {{elementary and high school}} levels, but not at the middle school level. At the middle school level, we find no difference between the effectiveness of Comprehensive Life Skills programs and <b>Social</b> <b>Influences</b> programs for cigarettes, marijuana, all drugs combined, and all drugs excluding alcohol. For alcohol measures, we find the <b>Social</b> <b>Influences</b> programs are significantly more effective than the Comprehensive Life Skills programs. Furthermore, we find the "success " of the <b>Social</b> <b>Influences</b> programs is largely attributable to their ability to reduce alcohol abuse. The <b>Social</b> <b>Influences</b> programs have no effect on the prevalence of alcohol use. The superiority of the <b>Social</b> <b>Influences</b> programs relative to the Comprehensive Life Skills programs at reducing the prevalence of alcohol use at the middle school level is a consequence of the fact that Comprehensive Life Skills programs are counterproductive, i. e., they encourage alcohol use without reducing alcohol abuse. We conclude that promoting abstinence may not be a viable objective when substance use is normative in the culture, but preventing abuse and its attendant harms may be viable...|$|R

5|$|Miller went to {{the local}} state school before {{transferring}} to Melbourne High Schoola selective government institution that accepted students through an academic examat the start of 1934. The school's emphasis on scholastic and sporting excellence and its culture was {{more in line with}} that of a private school than a standard government school. Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was on the teaching staff as Miller's mathematics teacher.}} Because he did little study and focused his energy on sport, Miller was a mediocre student.Perry, p. 18. In addition to cricket and football, Miller played baseball and competed in swimming. This disappointed Woodfull, a disciplined man who invoked the school's motto Honour the Work in exhorting his students to work hard as Australia was attempting to emerge from the depths of the Great Depression. Despite being Australia's captain, Woodfull refused to involve himself in the coaching of the school's cricket teams, feeling that it would intrude on the responsibilities of the sports teachers. Despite this, Woodfull watched the students at cricket training and quickly noticed Miller's skills. Aged 14 and still under , Miller was selected in the school's First XI. With his pads flapping against his stomach and sporting a sawn-down bat, Miller batted at No. 6 and scored 44 on his senior debut. Although his lack of power was obvious, Miller's control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him the Unbowlable, the same nickname that was accorded to Woodfull, who had a similarly strong defensive style. Melbourne {{went on to win the}} match,Perry, p. 20. and Miller impressed his captain Keith Truscott, who fought for his selection and took him under his wing. Truscott later became an ace fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force, and Miller would follow in his footsteps. Truscott's <b>social</b> <b>influence</b> compounded the distractions from Miller's study. Miller failed all eight of his subjects at the end of 1934, and with an average mark of 25%, was the class dunce. He scored zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class,Perry, p. 21. and was forced to repeat year 9.|$|E

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>influences</b> play an {{important}} part in the actions that an individual agent may perform within a multi-agent society. However, the incomplete knowledge and the diverse and conflicting influences present within such societies, may stop an agent from abiding by all its <b>social</b> <b>influences.</b> This may, in turn, lead to conflicts that the agents need to identify, manage, and resolve in order for the society to behave in a coherent manner. To this end, we present an empirical study of an argumentation-based negotiation (ABN) approach that allows the agents to detect such conflicts, and then manage and resolve them through the use of argumentative dialogues. To test our theory, we map our ABN model to a multi-agent task allocation scenario. Our results show that using an argumentation approach allows agents to both efficiently and effectively manage their <b>social</b> <b>influences</b> even under high degrees of incompleteness. Finally, we show that allowing agents to argue and resolve such conflicts early in the negotiation encounter increases their efficiency in managing <b>social</b> <b>influences...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Adolescent smoking {{continues}} to rise in the United States. Individuals from economically-disadvantaged households appear {{at high risk for}} smoking. This study focused on a sample of economically-disad-vantaged adolescents attending New York City schools (N = 1875). Longitudinal predictors of smoking from four domains (socio-demo-graphic background information, <b>social</b> <b>influences</b> to smoke, <b>social</b> and personal competence, and individual differences) were tested. <b>Social</b> <b>influences</b> to smoke, from mothers and friends, both predicted smoking one year later. Poor decision-making skills, and low psychological well-being also predicted subsequent smoking. Conclusion: These findings support social learning theory (Bandura, 1977) and problem behavior theory (Jessor, 1991). Furthermore, the results suggest that training ado-lescents to resist <b>social</b> <b>influences</b> to smoke, to problem solve and make sound decisions, and how to cope with psychological distress are among the key components for effective smoking prevention approaches.
