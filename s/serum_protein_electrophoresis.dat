40|$|Introduction: Multiple myeloma {{represents}} a malignant proliferation of plasma cells {{derived from a}} single clone and it results in bone pain or fracture, renal failure, susceptibility to infections, anemia and hypercalcemia. The hyper viscosity syndrome is rare. Cryoglobulins are immunoglubulins that precipitate at temperatures less than 37 degrees Celsius. Monoclonal cryoglobulins are usually present along with a specific hematologic disorder and are often asymptomatic. We report a second case of multiple myeloma with gangrene of all four extremities. Case: The Patient was a 77 year–old farmer with a 2 weeks history of coldness, pain and discoloration of the fingers of both the extremities which had extended to the mid forearm and shin regions.

The electromyography showed anterior horn involvement in 3 cases. The electrocardiography showed repolarization disorders in 11 cases, left ventricular overload in 6 cases and atrioventricular block in 5 cases. The <b>serum</b> <b>proteins</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> showed frequent abnormalities, but no typical curve could be obtained. The barium-contrasted X-rays of the gastrointestinal tract showed no anatomical lesions, but functional abnormalities (hypo or hypermotility) were found in 14 examinations. The Schilling test showed impairment of vitamin B 12 absorption in 50 % of the cases. However, with the concomitant administration of intrinsic factor (3 cases) there was improvement of its absorption. This proves that the gastric mucosa {{plays an important role in}} the disease malabsorption. The test with labeled-triolein showed slow absorption in 2 cases and steatorrhea in 3 (6 tests). For the confirmation of the amyloid deposits, the best histopathological procedure was nerve biopsy. In men, when the nerve biopsy was negative, testicular biopsy has shown to be a good option.

50|$|<b>Serum</b> <b>protein</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> (SPEP or SPE) is a {{laboratory}} test that examines specific proteins {{in the blood}} called globulins. The most common indications for a <b>serum</b> <b>protein</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> test are to diagnose or monitor multiple myeloma, a monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS), or further investigate a discrepancy between a low albumin and a relatively high total protein. Unexplained bone pain, anemia, proteinuria, renal insufficiency, and hypercalcemia are also signs of multiple myeloma, and indications for SPE. Blood must first be collected, usually into an airtight vial or syringe. Electrophoresis is {{a laboratory}} technique in which the blood serum (the fluid portion of the blood after the blood has clotted) is applied to an acetate membrane soaked in a liquid buffer., to a buffered agarose gel matrix.gel, or into liquid in a capillary tube, and exposed to an electric current to separate the serum protein components into five major fractions by size and electrical charge: serum albumin, alpha-1 globulins, alpha-2 globulins, beta 1 and 2 globulins, and gamma globulins.|$|E
