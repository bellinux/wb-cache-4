25|$|An {{operational}} amplifier can, if necessary, {{be forced to}} act as a comparator. The smallest difference between the input voltages will be amplified enormously, causing the output to swing to nearly the supply voltage. However, it is usually better to use a dedicated comparator for this purpose, as its output has a higher slew rate and can reach either power <b>supply</b> <b>rail.</b> Some op-amps have clamping diodes on the input that prevent use as a comparator.|$|E
25|$|When the Liberal Reform Party under Carruthers won the 1904 election, Le was {{appointed}} as Secretary for Public Works on 30 August 1904. Serving through Carruther's successor, Charles Wade, to the government's fall on 20 October 1910, Lee presided over an extensive public works programme. Among the projects {{he helped to}} develop were the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, Cataract Dam for the Sydney water <b>supply,</b> <b>rail</b> infrastructure expansion, {{the construction of the}} Burrinjuck Dam, and the creation of the town of Leeton, which was named after him.|$|E
25|$|Specific {{rail-to-rail}} comparators with p-n-p input transistors, {{like the}} LM139 family, allow the input potential to drop 0.3nbsp&volts below the negative <b>supply</b> <b>rail,</b> {{but do not}} allow it {{to rise above the}} positive rail. Specific ultra-fast comparators, like the LMH7322, allow input signal to swing below the negative rail and above the positive rail, although by a narrow margin of only 0.2nbsp&V. Differential input voltage (the voltage between two inputs) of a modern rail-to-rail comparator is usually limited only by the full swing of power supply.|$|E
50|$|Normal {{differential}} amplifiers {{and operational}} amplifiers powered between two power <b>supply</b> <b>rails</b> (say VCC and VEE) can only handle signals that lie {{between these two}} power rails. If a voltage outside the power <b>supply</b> <b>rails</b> {{is applied to the}} input, internal ESD protection diodes turn on, causing large currents to flow and damage these parts.|$|R

25|$|The low leakage {{and high}} {{capacity}} of tantalum capacitors favor {{their use in}} sample and hold circuits to achieve long hold duration, and some long duration timing circuits where precise timing is not critical. They are also often used for power <b>supply</b> <b>rail</b> decoupling in parallel with film or ceramic capacitors which provide low ESR and low reactance at high frequency. Tantalum capacitors can replace aluminum electrolytic capacitors in situations where the external environment or dense component packing results in a sustained hot internal environment and where high reliability is important. Equipment such as medical electronics and space equipment that require high quality and reliability makes use of tantalum capacitors.|$|E
5000|$|Instrumentation Amplifiers {{can also}} be {{designed}} using [...] "Indirect Current-feedback Architecture", which extend the operating range of these amplifiers to the negative power <b>supply</b> <b>rail,</b> {{and in some cases}} the positive power <b>supply</b> <b>rail.</b> This can be particularly useful in single-supply systems, where the negative power rail is simply the circuit ground (GND). Examples of parts utilizing this architecture are MAX4208/MAX4209 and AD8129/AD8130.|$|E
50|$|ISO 11898-2 {{provides}} some immunity to {{common mode voltage}} between transmitter and receiver by having a 0 V rail running along the bus to maintain {{a high degree of}} voltage association between the nodes. Also, in the de facto mechanical configuration mentioned above, a <b>supply</b> <b>rail</b> is included to distribute power to each of the transceiver nodes. The design provides a common supply for all the transceivers. The actual voltage to be applied by the bus and which nodes apply to it are application-specific and not formally specified. Common practice node design provides each node with transceivers which are optically isolated from their node host and derive a 5 V linearly regulated supply voltage for the transceivers from the universal <b>supply</b> <b>rail</b> provided by the bus. This usually allows operating margin on the <b>supply</b> <b>rail</b> sufficient to allow interoperability across many node types. Typical values of supply voltage on such networks are 7 to 30 V. However, the lack of a formal standard means that system designers are responsible for <b>supply</b> <b>rail</b> compatibility.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the domain}} of MOSFET circuits, [...] "bootstrapping" [...] is {{commonly}} used to mean pulling up the operating point of a transistor above the power <b>supply</b> <b>rail.</b> The same term has been used somewhat more generally for dynamically altering the operating point of an operational amplifier (by shifting both its positive and negative <b>supply</b> <b>rail)</b> {{in order to increase}} its output voltage swing (relative to the ground). In the sense used in this paragraph, bootstrapping an operational amplifier means [...] "using a signal to drive the reference point of the op-amp's power supplies". A more sophisticated use of this rail bootstrapping technique is to alter the non-linear C/V characteristic of the inputs of a JFET op-amp in order to decrease its distortion.|$|E
