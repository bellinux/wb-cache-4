5|$|In 1782, the British staged an {{invasion}} of Kentucky {{with the help of}} their Native American allies, including Wyandots, Ottawas and Ojibwas. When Trigg received word of their attack on Bryan Station, he was commanding the fort at Harrodsburg. He quickly assembled 135 local militiamen and met up with Colonel Daniel Boone and Major Levi Todd and more militia at Bryan Station. When they approached the Blue Licks, a <b>salt</b> <b>lick</b> next to the Licking River, officers suspected a trap and convened a war council, but unruly troops lost patience and crossed the river. The three leaders formed a column each, with Trigg commanding the right. When they met with the opposing force, Trigg's column was ambushed. Trigg was killed and his men fell back after only five minutes of battle. When troops returned to the scene of battle, Trigg's body was found quartered.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{evaporation}} ponds at {{the edges}} of the lake produce salts and brine (water with high salt quantity). Minerals extracted from the lake include: sodium chloride (common salt), used in water softeners, <b>salt</b> <b>lick</b> blocks for livestock, and to melt ice on local roadways (food-grade salt is not produced from the lake, as it would require further costly processing to ensure its purity); potassium sulfate, used as a commercial fertilizer; and magnesium-chloride brine, used in the production of magnesium metal, chlorine gas, and as a dust suppressant. US Magnesium operates a plant on the southwest shore of the lake, which produces 14 percent of the worldwide supply of magnesium, more than any other North American magnesium operation. Mineral-extraction companies operating on the lake pay royalties on their products to the State of Utah, which owns the lake.|$|E
25|$|In early 1779, Robertson and John Donelson {{traveled}} overland across country {{along the}} Kentucky Road and founded Fort Nashborough at the French <b>Salt</b> <b>Lick</b> (which {{got its name}} from having previously been {{the site of a}} French outpost called Fort Charleville) on the Cumberland River. It was the first of many such settlements in the Cumberland area, which subsequently became the focus of attacks by all the tribes in the surrounding region.

5000|$|There is {{debate over}} whether {{geophagia}} in bats is primarily for nutritional supplementation or detoxification. It is known that some species of bats regularly visit mineral or <b>salt</b> <b>licks</b> to increase mineral consumption. However, Voigt et al. demonstrated that both mineral-deficient and healthy bats visit <b>salt</b> <b>licks</b> at the same rate. [...] Therefore, mineral supplementation {{is unlikely to be}} the primary reason for geophagia in bats. Additionally, bat presence at <b>salt</b> <b>licks</b> increases during periods of high energy demand. Voigt et al. concluded that the primary purpose for bat presence at <b>salt</b> <b>licks</b> is for detoxification purposes, compensating for the increased consumption of toxic fruit and seeds. This was shown to be especially evident in lactating and pregnant bats, as their food intake increases to meet higher energy demands.|$|R
5|$|The vegetal diet of the Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} is high {{in fiber}} and only moderate in protein. <b>Salt</b> <b>licks</b> {{are very important to}} the nutrition of the rhino. These licks can be small hot springs, seepages of salty water, or mud-volcanoes. The <b>salt</b> <b>licks</b> also serve an important social purpose for the rhinos—males visit the licks to pick up the scent of females in oestrus. Some Sumatran rhinos, however, live in areas where <b>salt</b> <b>licks</b> are not readily available, or the rhinos have not been observed using the licks. These rhinos may get their necessary mineral requirements by consuming plants rich in minerals.|$|R
25|$|Fine-grained {{volcanic}} ash from volcanoes west and {{northwest of the}} Teton area was periodically deposited in the quiet shallow water of the Western Interior Seaway throughout Cretaceous time. Ash deposited in this manner was later altered to bentonite; a type of clay used in the foundry industry and {{as a component of}} oil well drilling mud. Elk and deer in Jackson Hole use exposures of bentonite as a (bitter) <b>salt</b> <b>lick.</b> Bentonite swells when wet, which causes landslides that sometimes block access roads into Jackson Hole.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of August 19, the Kentuckians reached the Licking River, near a spring and <b>salt</b> <b>lick</b> known as the Lower Blue Licks. A few Indian scouts were seen {{watching}} them from across the river. Behind the scouts was a hill around which the river looped. Todd called a council and asked Daniel Boone, the most experienced woodsman, what he thought. Boone {{said he had been}} growing increasingly suspicious because of the obvious trail the Indians left. He felt the Indians were trying to lead them into an ambush.|$|E
25|$|Roaming {{bear and}} herds of deer and buffalo once visited the <b>salt</b> <b>lick</b> near the present-day {{site of the}} West Baden Springs Hotel as they {{traveled}} along the Buffalo Trace in southern Indiana. Native Americans also used the area as hunting grounds. Following the arrival of French traders and settlers in the vicinity, the site became known as French Lick. When George Rogers Clark passed through southern Indiana in 1778, he camped {{less than a mile}} from the salt licks and mineral springs in Orange County that became known as French Lick and West Baden Springs. The presence of salt deposits enticed the state government to consider mining large quantities of salt for early pioneers to use in preserving meat, but when it was determined that the saline content was insufficient to support large-scale salt mining, the property was offered for sale around 1832. William A. Bowles, a local physician, purchased the land that included the mineral springs and built a small inn. Constructed around 1840–45, it developed into the French Lick Springs Hotel, a popular health resort.|$|E

When European explorers arrived, the area was {{populated}} by the Osage and Missouri Indians. In 1678, La Salle claimed all of Missouri for France. The Lewis and Clark Expedition passed by the area on the Missouri River in early June 1804. In 1806, two sons of Daniel Boone established a <b>salt</b> <b>lick</b> [...] northwest of Columbia. giving the area its early name: [...] Boonslick.

500|$|Poaching of Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} is a {{cause for}} concern, {{as the price of}} its horn has been estimated as high as US$30,000 per kilogram. This species has been overhunted for many centuries, leading to the current greatly reduced– and still declining– population. The rhinos are difficult to observe and hunt directly (one field researcher spent seven weeks in a treehide near a <b>salt</b> <b>lick</b> without ever observing a rhino directly), so poachers make use of spear traps and pit traps. In the 1970s, uses of the rhinoceros's body parts among the local people of Sumatra were documented, {{such as the use of}} rhino horns in amulets and a folk belief that the horns offer some protection against poison. Dried rhinoceros meat was used as medicine for diarrhea, leprosy, and tuberculosis. [...] "Rhino oil", a concoction made from leaving a rhino's skull in coconut oil for several weeks, may be used to treat skin diseases. The extent of use and belief in these practices is not known. Rhinoceros horn was once believed to be widely used as an aphrodisiac; in fact traditional Chinese medicine never used it for this purpose. Nevertheless, hunting in this species has primarily been driven by a demand for rhino horns with supposedly medicinal properties.|$|E

30|$|Most camel {{owners in}} the Northeastern Nigeria graze their herds away from {{wetlands}} and provide <b>salt</b> <b>licks</b> {{as part of their}} health management practices. The dampness of the wetland environment is a major challenge for livestock production because it favours development of biting flies which are potential vectors of trypanosomiasis in camels. Grazing of camels in wetlands may also predispose to foot rot which could lead to high mortality and affect production. Camels have a high salt requirement, up to six to eight times higher than that of other domestic animals (Farah 2004). This salt requirement may be partially satisfied during grazing and should be supplemented by provision of additional salt. This explains why camel herders in this study provide <b>salt</b> <b>licks</b> to their animals.|$|R
