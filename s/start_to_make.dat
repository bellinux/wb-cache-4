5|$|Many arctiid moths make clicks when hunted by echolocating bats; {{they also}} often contain {{unpalatable}} chemicals. Some such as dogbane tiger moths (Cycnia tenera) have ears and conspicuous coloration, and <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> clicks when echolocating bats approach. An experiment by Canadian zoologists John M. Ratcliffe and James H. Fullard, using dogbane tiger moths and northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis), suggests the signals in fact both disrupt echolocation and warn of chemical defence. The behaviour of these insects is thus both deimatic and aposematic.|$|E
5|$|Veronica and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) watch a {{movie at}} her house. She {{questions}} him about Piz’s mood, while Keith enters and says he is currently unopposed in the Sheriff election. Piz runs up to Veronica and states {{that he has been}} chosen to be a guide for a rock star named Desmond Fellows. However, his show depends on some tapes Desmond is carrying with him, but when Piz checks him into his hotel room, they are missing. Piz calls Veronica for the case and runs into Logan in the elevator. Desmond points to several potential suspects. Logan asks Mac for study help, and he agrees. Piz starts his show with Desmond, and it goes terribly, as Desmond makes racial epithets and sexual advances. Veronica and Piz track down a teacher, who denies involvement, but the pair find a flyer for a group that threatened to boycott Desmond’s show. Piz and Desmond talk about his past and <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> progress, but he ends up going to a party with Dick (Ryan Hansen) instead of playing guitar with Piz.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} dream sequence, Buffy is woken by Anya in her dorm room. She then finds {{herself in her}} room at home, where Tara speaks cryptically about the future. At the university, Buffy talks to her mother, {{who lives in the}} walls, then meets Riley at the Initiative. He has been {{promoted}} to Surgeon General and is drawing up plans with Adam (now in ordinary human form) for world domination. The three of them are interrupted by a demon attack, and Riley and Adam <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a pillow fort. When Buffy finds her weapons bag, the only thing in it is mud, which she smears on her face. She is then transported to the desert and finally confronts the pre-verbal First Slayer; Tara is present to speak for her. Through Tara, the First Slayer tells Buffy that she cannot have friends and must work alone, which Buffy rejects. The Slayers fight in the desert and then in Buffy's living room next to her dying friends until Buffy realizes that she can stop the fight mentally by simply ignoring the First Slayer. She refuses to fight and walks away from the First Slayer; the First Slayer vanishes, and everybody wakes up.|$|E

5|$|Wholesale {{reform of}} Oxford {{examinations}} {{began in the}} late eighteenth century, proposed by, among others, Brasenose's John Napleton in his pamphlet Considerations on the Public Exercises for the First and Second Degrees in the University of Oxford. It was Cleaver and his successor Frodsham Hodson that would continue the reforms and apply them to Brasenose itself. Cleaver was from the minor gentry and set out from the <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Brasenose the place of rich men. Unable to secure the librarianship of the Bodleian whilst fellow, he had instead become tutor to his patron George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham – a position which he used to lead two of the Duke's sons {{and other members of the}} family to Brasenose; the sons' uncle, Baron Grenville, became the University's Chancellor. Under his leadership into the early nineteenth century, numbers improved dramatically and so did the class of people coming: Brasenose began to be dominated by gentlemen like the Egertons, the Grenvilles, and of Richard Rainshaw Rothwell I. Its income over doubled between 1790 and 1810 to £9,200 per annum, with the college maintaining its links to the north-west. Among the other acquisitions of Cleaver was the services of Hodson, a Liverpudlian.|$|E

Then they move to the Kings Arms and then up towards the church taking in the Loco and the Duke William on the way, drinking and singing as they go. Around 2:30pm the officials leave the Duke and process up to the church.|$|E
25|$|By the 16th century, the Christian Kingdom of Georgia {{had become}} {{fractured}} {{into a series}} of smaller states which were fought over by the two great Muslim empires in the region, Ottoman Turkey and Safavid Persia. But {{during the second half of}} the century a third imperial power emerged to the north, namely the Russian state of Muscovy, which shared Georgia's Orthodox religion. Diplomatic contacts between the Georgian Kingdom of Kakheti and Moscow began in 1558 and in 1589, Tsar Fyodor I offered to put the kingdom under his protection. Yet little help was forthcoming and the Russians were still too remote from the south Caucasus region to challenge Ottoman or Persian control and hegemony successfully. Only in the early 18th century did Russia <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> serious military inroads south of the Caucasus. In 1722, Peter the Great exploited the chaos and turmoil in the Safavid Persian Empire to lead an expedition against it, while he struck an alliance with Vakhtang VI, the Georgian ruler of Kartli and the Safavid-appointed governor of the region. However, the two armies failed to link up and the Russians retreated northward again, leaving the Georgians to the mercy of the Persians. Vakhtang ended his days in exile in Russia.|$|E

25|$|On November 8, 1997, one {{day before}} Survivor Series, McMahon met with Pat Patterson and Michaels {{in a hotel room}} in Montreal and planned the screwjob. It is unclear how many people knew of the {{impending}} screwjob, but McMahon's close aides Gerald Brisco and Sgt. Slaughter had been involved in the planning. Jim Ross has insisted {{that he did not know}} the screwjob would take place, although many, including various members of Hart's family, thought he was involved. In a radio interview, Ross also confirmed that Jerry Lawler also did not know that the screwjob would take place. Hart and Michaels had met with Pat Patterson to discuss the match setup and plan, during which Hart agreed to allow Michaels to put him into the Sharpshooter hold at a time when the referee would be unconscious, as Patterson suggested. The rest of the match was planned to proceed thus: Hart would grab Michaels' foot and reverse the hold, putting him in the Sharpshooter. Michaels would submit to the hold, but the referee would still be unconscious. Hart would let go of the hold to try to revive the referee, but Michaels would hit Hart with his finisher, Sweet Chin Music, and make the pin. A second referee would then run to the ring with Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, and Davey Boy Smith following close behind. The second referee would start the count, but Owen and Davey Boy would break the pin. The original referee would then recover and <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the count, but Hart would kick out, setting up about five more minutes of brawling that would result in a disqualification.|$|E

However, a 2011 study, commissioned by the UK Department for Transport (DfT) and conducted by the Transport Research Laboratory, found little correlation between pedestrian vehicle involvement density and noise level for the majority of vehicles. In addition, the analysis found no evidence of a pattern in pedestrian vehicle involvement densities when only considering those accidents occurring on [...] or slower roads, or where the pedestrian was disabled. A previous study did not found an increased pedestrian vehicle involvement density for electric and hybrid vehicles with respect to their conventional counterparts which raised the question as to whether added sound is necessarily required.|$|E

500|$|The Hallucination version {{had only}} a basic story concept, having dropped the {{previous}} scenario penned by Noboru Sugimura of Flagship. In 2012, [...] scenario writer Yasuhisa Kawamura said {{he was responsible for}} this version, as he wanted to make Biohazard 4 scarier [...] "and suggested using a particular scene from the film Lost Souls, where the main character [...] suddenly finds herself in a derelict building with a killer on the loose. An arranged version of this idea eventually turned into Hook Man. The idea went through several iterations as Mr. Sugimura and I carefully refined this world (which, I have to say, was very romantic). Leon infiltrates the castle of Spencer seeking the truth, while inside a laboratory located deep within, a young girl wakes up. Accompanied by a B.O.W. [...] dog, the two <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their way up the castle. Unfortunately, there were many obstacles that needed to be overcome and the cost of development was deemed too expensive." [...] Kawamura added he was very sorry and [...] "even ashamed" [...] that Mikami had to step in and scrap this version. After this attempt, the last canceled revision featured classic zombies again. However, it was discontinued after few months, and before it was ever shown to the public, as the developers felt it was too formulaic.|$|E
500|$|Contributing to psychedelia's {{emergence}} {{into the}} pop mainstream was {{the release of}} Beach Boys' Pet Sounds (May 1966) and the Beatles' Revolver (August 1966). Often {{considered one of the}} earliest albums in the canon of psychedelic rock, Pet Sounds contained many elements that would be incorporated into psychedelia, with its artful experiments, psychedelic lyrics based on emotional longings and self-doubts, elaborate sound effects and new sounds on both conventional and unconventional instruments. The album track [...] "I Just Wasn't Made for These Times" [...] contained the first use of theremin sounds on a rock record. Scholar Philip Auslander says that even though psychedelic music is not normally associated with the Beach Boys, the [...] "odd directions" [...] and experiments in Pet Sounds [...] "put it all on the map. ... basically that sort of opened the door — not for groups to be formed or to <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> music, but certainly to become as visible as say Jefferson Airplane or somebody like that." [...] Like Pet Sounds, Revolver explored musical soundscapes that could not be replicated in concert, even with the addition of an orchestra. The Beatles' May 1966 B-side [...] "Rain", recorded during the Revolver sessions, was the first pop recording to include reversed sounds. It makes full use of an assortment of studio tricks such as varispeed and backwards taping, combining them with a droning melody that further highlights a growing interest in non-Western musical form. Author Simon Philo believes the song to be [...] "the birth of British psychedelic rock". [...] Author Steve Turner recognises the Beatles' success in conveying an LSD-inspired worldview on Revolver, particularly on [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows", as having [...] "opened the doors to psychedelic rock (or acid rock)".|$|E

2500|$|The album {{informed}} the developments of genres such as rock, hip hop, jazz, electronic, experimental, punk, pop, {{and is often}} cited {{as one of the}} earliest entries in the canon of psychedelic rock. Scholar Philip Auslander explains that even though psychedelic music is not normally associated with the Beach Boys, the [...] "odd directions" [...] and experiments in Pet Sounds [...] "put it all on the map.... basically that sort of opened the door—not for groups to be formed or to <b>start</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> music, but certainly to become as visible as say Jefferson Airplane or somebody like that." [...] Decider wrote that the album [...] "almost single-handedly created the idea of 'baroque pop'." [...] Many Los Angeles record producers imitated the album's orchestral style, which became a component to the sunshine pop acts that followed. Chicago Reader Noah Berlatsky argued that the Beach Boys helped develop smooth soul, bridging a gap between the polished pop harmonizing of the Drifters and the experimentation of the Chi-Lites, particularly with [...] "Sloop John B", whose [...] "fussy" [...] arrangements, [...] "pure" [...] harmonies, and [...] "childish vulnerability" [...] he says [...] "come out of a tradition of pop R". Wilson also became a [...] "godfather" [...] to an era of indie musicians who were inspired by his melodic sensibilities, studio experimentation, and chamber pop orchestrations. Chamber pop itself was based on the template provided by Pet Sounds. Treblezines Ernest Simpson and Wild Nothing's Jack Tatum characterize it as the first emo album.|$|E
