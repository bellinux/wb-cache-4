During the ceremony, Katniss delivers an impromptu, heartfelt speech expressing her feelings toward Rue and also Thresh, who spared her life. When she finishes, an old man whistles the tune that Rue used in the arena to tell Katniss that she was safe. Everyone else salutes Katniss, using the same gesture that <b>she</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> farewell to Rue. To Katniss's horror, the old man is quickly executed before her eyes.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, and <b>she</b> just <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{it in this}} way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui dit un de ces rats; parlez!' She made me lift my hand--so--to {{remind me}} to raise my voice at the question. Now shall I dance for you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|This time {{at least}} her speech, while she went from point to point, {{completely}} hushed him, though {{after a full}} glimpse of the direction it was taking he ceased to meet her eyes and only sat staring hard at {{the pattern of the}} rug. Even when at last he spoke it was without looking up. [...] "You're indeed, as <b>she</b> herself <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> the modern daughter! It takes that type to wish to make a career for her parents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had seen}} her looking into my bag one day. And <b>she</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I loved my manuscripts too much ever to love her. But I am sure she did not do it." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a February 2006 {{attack that}} The Jewish Press {{described}} as [...] "eerily similar", Lemkus was stabbed while waiting at a hitchhiking {{station at the}} Gush Etzion Junction. She had continued taking rides at the official hitching posts which are built in areas where public transit is scarce, regarding it {{as an act of}} defiance against terrorism. <b>She</b> had been <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> “You think I’m going to let them beat me?" [...] She was buried in Tekoa.|$|R

"No, I suppose not; and I'm sure I shouldn't {{have asked}} you, because I think it isn't the thing, {{dragging}} people away {{out of their}} own parishes, here and there, to anybody's church. And I told her that though I would of course go and hear Mr. Prong now and then if she married him, I wouldn't leave Mr. Comfort, not as a regular thing. But she didn't seem to mind that now, much as <b>she</b> <b>used</b> always <b>to</b> be <b>saying</b> about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Pen {{looked at}} her wildly for an instant--"I couldn't sleep," [...] he said--"I--I was--I was writing."--And hereupon he flung his arms round her neck and said, [...] "O mother! I love her, I love her!"--How could such a kind soul as that help {{soothing}} and pitying him? The gentle creature did her best: and thought with a strange wonderment and tenderness {{that it was only}} yesterday that he was a child in that bed; and how <b>she</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> come and <b>say</b> her prayers over it before he woke upon holiday mornings.|$|R
6000|$|The widow {{was indeed}} fond of seeing, as <b>she</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "all the fun that was goin'," [...] {{but on this}} {{occasion}} she consented to carry Brown-eyes out of danger while the settlers moved at a quick step towards the point.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{initially}} named College d'études françaises ("C.E.F.") {{and more recently}} the Lycée International de Los Angeles (LILA). In September 2015, the School officially {{changed its name to}} the International School of Los Angeles. The School was established in 1978. Since the original founders (Monique Mickus, Jacques & Pierrette Gaspart) had French backgrounds, they chose the proven French educational system as the foundation for the School's curriculum. Mme Christiane Bayet, mother of Monique Mickus, who was on the original Board of Trustees for the school and an educator herself, taught French, Latin and Philosophy when the school first opened in 1978. <b>She</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> quote a <b>saying</b> from Victor Hugo: [...] "Open schools and you will close prisons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{would go}} {{to the end of the}} world with so irresistible a lady!" [...] Ransom exclaimed, falling into the tone which Mrs. Luna always found so unsatisfactory. It was a part of his Southern gallantry--his accent always came out {{strongly}} when he said anything of that sort--and it committed him to nothing in particular. She had had occasion to wish, more than once, that he wouldn't be so beastly polite, as <b>she</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> hear people <b>say</b> in England. She answered that she didn't care about ends, she cared about beginnings; but he didn't take up the declaration; he returned to the subject of Olive, wanted to know what she had done over there, whether she had worked them up much.|$|R
5000|$|Chungtak competed {{as one of}} the 90 contestants in the {{environmental}}ly-oriented Miss Earth 2006 beauty pageant. Aside {{from her}} environmental advocacy, <b>she</b> <b>used</b> her platform <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that [...] "Tibet is not a part of China" [...] and [...] "there is no freedom in Tibet". [...] She also advocated for the boundaries of acceptable social etiquette towards modernity, in a traditionally conservative Tibetan culture, where most grown women wear ankle-length dresses. Nonetheless, her participation in the pageant received an approval from the Dalai Lama. She made more headlines in December 2007 when she withdrew her participation in the Miss Tourism contest, a minor international beauty pageant held in Malaysia, after organizers reacted to pressure from Beijing and asked her to add [...] "China" [...] to her [...] "Miss Tibet" [...] title by wearing a sash labeled [...] "Miss Tibet-China".|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--somehow I don't. <b>She</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> if {{she ever}} got drunk again she'd never come back. But she didn't have any money--she's given Mr. Bentley every cent of it. And we didn't have any warning. She was as cheerful as could be {{yesterday}} morning, Mrs. McQuillen says." ...|$|E

"So there was, Mr. Peter," [...] {{answered}} Tabitha, [...] "and she {{was near}} {{about a hundred}} years old. <b>She</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that she and old Peter Goldthwaite had often spent a sociable evening by the kitchen fire--pretty much as you and I are doing now, Mr. Peter." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{music video}} (directed by Joel Schumacher) {{features}} Gavin {{looking for an}} apartment and finding himself {{in a room with}} a woman (played by actress Michele Hicks). She is dressed in black and does not acknowledge him until their hands meet on the wall. After this first touch, they begin to kiss and take off their clothes. This sequence is interlinked with scenes of them wordlessly putting their clothes back on after sex. She seems troubled by either regret or the desire to tell him something, but she leaves without a word. After this, she is sitting on a chair elsewhere while Gavin begins painting the wall with the lyrics about 'silence' and 'talking', seeming upset and frustrated. Afterwards, Gavin catches up with her on a sidewalk, and <b>she</b> <b>uses</b> sign language <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that she can't hear him. She is then pulled away by a concerned friend who <b>uses</b> sign language <b>to</b> ask her why she did not call.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Gentlemen, I hope I do no {{injustice}} to my uncle's memory, when I {{express my}} opinion, {{that although he}} was a bachelor, he had held some ladies in his arms before this time; I believe, indeed, that he had rather a habit of kissing barmaids; and I know, that {{in one or two}} instances, he had been seen by credible witnesses, to hug a landlady in a very perceptible manner. I mention the circumstance, to show what a very uncommon sort of person this beautiful young lady must have been, to have affected my uncle in the way <b>she</b> did; he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> that as her long dark hair trailed over his arm, and her beautiful dark eyes fixed themselves upon his face when she recovered, he felt so strange and nervous that his legs trembled beneath him. But who can look in a sweet, soft pair of dark eyes, without feeling queer? I can't, gentlemen. I am afraid to look at some eyes I know, and that's the truth of it.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. and Mrs. Ferrars did {{not wish}} to move, but had they so wished, it would have been under any {{circumstances}} for them a laborious and costly affair. The only newspaper they saw was the [...] "Evening Mail," [...] which arrived three times a week, and was the [...] "Times" [...] newspaper with all its contents except its advertisements. As the [...] "Times" [...] newspaper had the credit of mainly contributing to the passing of Lord Grey's Reform Bill, and was then whispered to enjoy the incredible sale of twelve thousand copies daily, Mr. Ferrars assumed that in its columns he would trace the most authentic intimations of coming events. The cost of postage was then so heavy, that domestic correspondence was necessarily very restricted. But this vexatious limitation hardly applied to the Ferrars. They had never paid postage. They were born and had always lived in the franking world, and although Mr. Ferrars had now himself lost the privilege, both official and parliamentary, still all their correspondents were frankers, and they addressed their replies without compunction to those who were free. Nevertheless, it was astonishing how little in their new life they cared to avail themselves of this correspondence. At first Zenobia wrote every week, almost every day, to Mrs. Ferrars, but after a time Mrs. Ferrars, though at first pleased by the attention, felt its recognition a burthen. Then Zenobia, who at length, {{for the first time in}} her life, had taken a gloomy view of affairs, relapsed into a long silence, and in fact had nearly forgotten the Ferrars, for as <b>she</b> herself <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "How can one recollect people whom one never meets?" ...|$|R

6000|$|It was {{on account}} {{of these things that}} mamma got her for such low pay, really for nothing: so much, one day when Mrs. Wix had {{accompanied}} her into the drawing-room and left her, the child heard one of the ladies she found there--a lady with eyebrows arched like skipping-ropes and thick black stitching, like ruled lines for musical notes on beautiful white gloves--announce to another. She knew governesses were poor; Miss Overmore was unmentionably and Mrs. Wix ever so publicly so. Neither this, however, nor the old brown frock nor the diadem nor the button, made a difference for Maisie in the charm put forth through everything, the charm of Mrs. Wix's conveying that somehow, in her ugliness and her poverty, she was peculiarly and soothingly safe; safer than any one in the world, than papa, than mamma, than the lady with the arched eyebrows; safer even, though so much less beautiful, than Miss Overmore, on whose loveliness, as she supposed it, the little girl was faintly conscious that one couldn't rest with quite the same tucked-in and kissed-for-good-night feeling. Mrs. Wix was as safe as Clara Matilda, who was in heaven and yet, embarrassingly, also in Kensal Green, where they had been together to see her little huddled grave. It was from something in Mrs. Wix's tone, which in spite of caricature remained indescribable and inimitable, that Maisie, before her term with her mother was over, drew this sense of a support, like a breast-high banister in a place of [...] "drops," [...] that would never give way. If she knew her instructress was poor and queer she also knew she was not nearly so [...] "qualified" [...] as Miss Overmore, who could say lots of dates straight off (letting you hold the book yourself), state the position of Malabar, play six pieces without notes and, in a sketch, put in beautifully the trees and houses and difficult parts. Maisie herself could play more pieces than Mrs. Wix, who was moreover visibly ashamed of her houses and trees and could only, {{with the help of a}} smutty forefinger, of doubtful legitimacy in the field of art, do the smoke coming out of the chimneys. They dealt, the governess and her pupil, in [...] "subjects," [...] but there were many the governess put off from week to week and that they never got to at all: <b>she</b> only <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "We'll take that in its proper order." [...] Her order was a circle as vast as the untravelled globe. She had not the spirit of adventure--the child could perfectly see how many subjects she was afraid of. She took refuge on the firm ground of fiction, through which indeed there curled the blue river of truth. She knew swarms of stories, mostly those of the novels she had read; relating them with a memory that never faltered and a wealth of detail that was Maisie's delight. They were all about love and beauty and countesses and wickedness. Her conversation was practically an endless narrative, a great garden of romance, with sudden vistas into her own life and gushing fountains of homeliness. These were the parts where they most lingered; she made the child take with her again every step of her long, lame course and think it beyond magic or monsters. Her pupil acquired a vivid vision of every one who had ever, in her phrase, knocked against her--some of them oh so hard!--every one literally but Mr. Wix, her husband, as to whom nothing was mentioned save that he had been dead for ages. He had been rather remarkably absent from his wife's career, and Maisie was never taken to see his grave.|$|R
