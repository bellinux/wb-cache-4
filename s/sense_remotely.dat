Accurate measurement of is important for numerous geomorphic and hydrologic applications, yet it is a surprisingly difficult quantity to measure, particularly over large areas. Like this {{in this paper we}} calculate canal density of Hisar district and used a consistent and efficient method of Horton (1945) for generating choropleth maps of canal density. This yields a theoretically sound tool for estimating spatial variability of canal density. This paper demonstrates a feasibility of automated canal density mapping on regional scales and using LISS III satellite data in GIS environment.

The transport of microwave power is described for modeled detection where the direction of power flow is explained by the Zeroth and Second Laws of Thermodynamics.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} a feasibility of automated drainage density mapping on regional scales and in high resolution, using remotely sensed elevation data. Such maps offer affordable means of surveying large regions for variability in spatially extended features, which themselves {{are difficult to}} <b>sense</b> <b>remotely,</b> but are expressed by the drainage density. We show that the proposed mapping method {{can be achieved by}} a combined utilization of two novel techniques: the curvature-based stream delineation algorithm, and the at-point assignment of drainage density values. In order to showcase our concept we have generated a map of drainage density for the study area in the Oregon Cascade Range. The map shows a sharp contrast in landscape dissection. A number of factors, potentially responsible for that contrast, were considered, and the variation of the underlying geology was judged to be a major factor responsible for an observed drainage density pattern. Although the unique geological setting of the study area was know to us a priori, we envision applying our mapping method to locations where remotely sensed elevation is the only available data, and the generated map is used to extract new geologic or environmental information...|$|E

40|$|Interplanetary {{scintillation}} (IPS), the twinkling {{of small}} angular diameter radio sources, {{is caused by}} the interaction of the signal with small-scale plasma irregularities in the solar wind. The technique may be used to <b>sense</b> <b>remotely</b> the near-Earth heliosphere and observations of a sufficiently large number of sources may be used to track large-scale disturbances as they propagate from close to the Sun to the Earth. Therefore, such observations have potential for use within geomagnetic forecasts. We use daily data from the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory, made available through the World Data Centre, to test the success of geomagnetic forecasts based on IPS observations. The approach discussed here was based on the reduction of the information in a map to a single number or series of numbers. The advantages of an index of this nature are that it may be produced routinely and that it could ideally forecast both the occurrence and intensity of geomagnetic activity. We start from an index that has already been described in the literature, INDEX 35 . On the basis of visual examination of the data in a full skymap format modifications were made {{to the way in which}} the index was calculated. It was hoped that these would lead to an improvement in its forecasting ability. Here we assess the forecasting potential of the index using the value of the correlation coefficient between daily Ap and the IPS index, with IPS leading by 1 day. We also compare the forecast based on the IPS index with forecasts of Ap currently released by the Space Environment Services Center (SESC). Although we find that the maximum improvement achieved is small, and does not represent a significant advance in forecasting ability, the IPS forecasts at this phase of the solar cycle are of a similar quality to those made by SESC...|$|E
40|$|Interplanetary {{scintillation}} (IPS), the twinkling {{of small}} angular diameter radio sources, {{arises from the}} interaction of the signal with small-scale plasma irregularities in the solar wind. The technique may be used to <b>sense</b> <b>remotely</b> the near-Earth heliosphere and has potential for tracking large-scale interplanetary disturbances from close to the Sun to the Earth. Such observations might be useful within routine geomagnetic forecasts, and we use data from the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory to test this suggestion. A forecast was based on the visual evaluation of each daily map. If an IPS event was observed then we proposed that any associated geomagnetic activity would occur either on that day, or during the following two days. We consider the success of these forecasts in predicting days when either an SSC/SI or an Ap value exceeding 30 were recorded. The identification of IPS events is necessarily subjective and so two observers compiled independent events lists, and the results were compared. Approximately half of the IPS events in each list were followed by a geomagnetic signature but comparison of the two lists showed that different days were being chosen. We also found that the forecasts had very high false alarm rates. Since IPS is sensitive to a volume we did not expect all events to be associated with a geomagnetic signature. However, the technique failed to forecast a large proportion of geomagnetic events and the association between IPS events and geomagnetic activity is not much better than would be expected by chance. Comparing the IPS forecasts with forecasts of Ap released by the Space Environment Services Center (SESC) we found that SESC correctly predicted a similar proportion of days when Apgeq 30, but that the performance was significantly better than would be expected by chance, and had a much lower false alarm rate. We conclude that these IPS data cannot be used alone to produce reliable geomagnetic activity forecasts...|$|E
40|$|Remote-Sensing Images (ARRSI); an {{automatic}} registration system built to register satellite and aerial <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> images. The {{system is designed}} specifically {{to address the problems}} associated with the registration of <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> images obtained at different times and/or from different sensors. The ARRSI system is capable of handling <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> images geometrically distorted by various transformations such as translation, rotation, and shear. Global and local contrast issues associated with <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> images are addressed in ARRSI using control-point detection and matching processes based on a phasecongruency model. Intensity-difference issues associated with multimodal registration of <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> images are addressed in ARRSI through the use of features that are invariant to intensity mappings during the control-point matching process. An adaptive control-point matching scheme is employed in ARRSI to reduce the performance issues associated with the registration of large <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> images. Finally, a variation on the Random Sample and Consensus algorithm called Maximum Distance Sample Consensus is introduced in ARRSI to improve the accuracy of the transformation model between two <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> images while minimizing computational overhead. The ARRSI system has been tested using various satellite and aerial <b>remotely</b> <b>sensed</b> images and evaluated based on its accuracy and computational performance.

Local binary pattern (LBP) is a texture model that has been widely used in many applications. Many variants of LBP have also been proposed.
