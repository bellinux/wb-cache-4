500|$|Monteux {{wished to}} {{continue}} his work in helping young conductors: [...] "Conducting is not enough. I must create something. I am not a composer, so I will create fine young musicians." [...] In addition to his classes in Paris and Les Baux in the 1930s he had given private lessons to Igor Markevitch; later private students included André Previn, Seiji Ozawa, José Serebrier and Robert Shaw. Previn called him [...] "the kindest, wisest man I can remember, {{and there was nothing}} about conducting he didn't know." [...] After a performance conducted by Previn, Monteux said to him, [...] "Did you think the orchestra was playing well? ... <b>So</b> <b>did</b> <b>I.</b> Next time don't interfere with them." [...] Previn said that he never forgot this advice. Monteux's best-known undertaking as a teacher was the Pierre Monteux School for conductors and orchestral musicians, held each summer at his home in Hancock, Maine from 1943 onwards. Internationally known alumni of the school include Leon Fleisher, Erich Kunzel, Lorin Maazel, Neville Marriner, Hugh Wolff and David Zinman. Other Monteux students included John Canarina, whose 2003 biography was the first full-length study of the conductor in English, Charles Bruck, one of Monteux's first pupils in Paris, who became music director of the school in Hancock after Monteux's death, and Emanuel Leplin.|$|E
