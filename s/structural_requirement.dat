25|$|The {{fundamental}} step, {{and usually}} the last, in {{the synthesis of}} β-blockers consists of adding a propanolamine side chain. This can be done following two paths which both involve alkylation of an appropriate phenoxide with epichlorohydrin (ECH). The first way is shown as the upper way in figure 5. It consists of phenoxide reacting at the oxirane and resulting in an alkoxide, that displaces the adjacent chloride {{to form a new}} epoxide ring. The second way is shown as the lower route in figure 5. It consists of displacement of the halogen directly with a SN2 reaction to give the same glycidic ether. When following both pathways, the central chiral carbon preserves its configuration, which is an important part to consider when synthesizing enantiomerically defined drugs. The ring opening of the epoxide ring in glycidic ether is done with an appropriate amine, such as isopropyl amine or tert-butylamine, and leads to the aryloxypropanolamine compound that consist of a secondary amine. This amine is typically known as the <b>structural</b> <b>requirement</b> for the β-adrenergic blocking activity.|$|E

Philips). That combined with higher solidity can lead to substantially greater structural costs than a HAWT in the support structure, the yaw bearing, and the foundation, when using conventional monopole designs. However, the advent of new tower designs, flange geometries and foundation systems appear to be successfully challenging these historical norms but if so then these advances can be equally well applied to improving the economics of conventional HAWT designs.|$|E
50|$|Cardiolipin (CL) {{is a kind}} of diphosphatidylglycerol lipid. Two {{phosphatidic acid}} {{moieties}} connect with a glycerol backbone in the center to form a dimeric structure. So it has four alkyl groups and potentially carries two negative charges. As there are four distinct alkyl chains in cardiolipin, the potential for complexity of this molecule species is enormous. However, in most animal tissues, cardiolipin contains 18-carbon fatty alkyl chains with 2 unsaturated bonds on each of them. It has been proposed that the (18:2)4 acyl chain configuration is an important <b>structural</b> <b>requirement</b> for the high affinity of CL to inner membrane proteins in mammalian mitochondria. However, studies with isolated enzyme preparations indicate that its importance may vary depending on the protein examined.|$|E

50|$|Smokehouses, {{similar to}} the one behind Stone Cottage, which was built in Charlotte, Vermont in 1820, were a staple of American farm life and {{remained}} in common use until the late 19th century. Typically small stone structures with dirt floors, smokehouses possessed a confined interior chamber that enabled farmers to easily preserve meat. As such, the major <b>structural</b> <b>requirement</b> of a smokehouse was that the building be airtight, although chimneys and small vents were sometimes installed to regulate the density of smoke. Traditionally, farmers would soak butchered cuts in brine and then hang them in their smokehouse above a smoldering fire of corncobs and hickory wood, giving the meat its distinctive flavor. Meats remained in place for several days, or sometimes weeks, to complete the process.|$|E

50|$|Lasofoxifene {{is among}} the most potent SERMs {{reported}} in protection against bone loss and cholesterol reduction. The excellent oral potency of lasofoxifene has been attributed to reduced intestinal glucuronidation of the phenol. Unlike raloxifene, lasofoxifene satisfies the requirement of a pharmacophore model that predicts resistance to gut wall glucuronidation. The <b>structural</b> <b>requirement</b> is a non-planar topology with the steric bulk close to the plane of a fused bicyclic aromatic system. The interactions between the ER and lasofoxifene are consistent with the general features of SERM-ER recognition. Lasofoxifenes large flexible side chain terminates in a pyrrolidine head group and threads its way out toward the surface of the protein, where it interferes directly with the positioning of the AF-2 helix. A salt bridge forms between lasofoxifene and Asp-351. The charge neutralization in this region ER may explain some antiestrogenic effects exerted by lasofoxifene.The indole system has served as a core unit in SERMs, and when an amine is attached to the indole with a benzyloxyethyl, the resultant compounds were shown to have no preclinical uterine activity while sparing rat bone with full efficacy at low doses. Bazedoxifene (1H-indo-5-ol,1-see figure 10 acetic acid) is one of those compounds. The core binding domain consists of a 2-phenyl-3-methyl indole and a hexamethylenamine ring at the side chain affecter region. It is metabolized by glucuronidation, with the absolute bioavailability of 6.2%, 3-fold higher than that of raloxifene. It has agonistic effects on bone and lipid metabolism but not on breast and uterine endometrium. It is well tolerated and displays no increase in hot flush incidences, uterine hypertrophy or breast tenderness.|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} of several hammerhead ribozyme constructs with constant lengths of stems I and III of 5 nt each but with variously shortened stems II is reported. Stems with 2 bp {{rather than the}} conventional 4 bp show essentially unaltered catalytic activity, independent of {{the composition of the}} tetraloop. Further reduction in size to 1 bp or 0 bp decreases activity drastically. Inversion of the G 10. 1. C 11. 1 bp next to the invariant core leads to a loss in activity, even when the stem consists of 4 bp. Thus, the minimal <b>structural</b> <b>requirement</b> for stem-loop II is a 2 -bp stem with a conserved G. C bp. The reduction in catalytic activity is predominantly a result of a decrease of catalytic constant kcat, whereas Km is only slightly affected. Thus, the <b>structural</b> <b>requirement</b> for optimal activity in these constructs where the chemical-cleavage step is rate limiting is determined by the stabilization of the transition state...|$|E
