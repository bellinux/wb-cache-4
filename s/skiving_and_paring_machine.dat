50|$|Coconut brandy is {{produced}} from the sap ("toddy") of borassus flowers that are extracted {{by a process}} called tapping <b>and</b> <b>paring.</b> The toddy is sourced from the borassus palm in Sri Lanka, where the borassus palm is tapped <b>and</b> <b>pared</b> {{for a total of}} 8 months, beginning {{in the first week of}} April and ending the second week of December each year.|$|R
30|$|Malinverni <b>and</b> <b>Pares</b> (2014) {{compiled}} {{a number of}} relevant categories to perform a systematic review of EC studies, including the theoretical context in which a study was performed, but also aspects of the user interface.

These categories contain additional subcategories (Malinverni & Pares, 2014).|$|R

40|$|The {{mutations}} {{that are}} responsible for fluoroquinolone resistance in the gyrA, gyrB, parC, <b>and</b> <b>parE</b> genes of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and serovar Paratyphi A were investigated. The sequences of the quinolone resistance-determining region of the gyrA gene in clinical isolates which showed decreased susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones had a single mutation at either the Ser- 83 or the Asp- 87 codon, and no mutations were found in the gyrB, parC, <b>and</b> <b>parE</b> genes...|$|R

40|$|The topoisomerase IV subunit A gene, parC homolog, {{has been}} cloned and sequenced from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1, with cDNA {{encoding}} the N-terminal region of Escherichia coli parC {{used as a}} probe. The homolog and its upstream gene were presumed to be parC <b>and</b> <b>parE</b> through sequence homology with the parC <b>and</b> <b>parE</b> genes of other organisms. The deduced amino acid sequence of ParC <b>and</b> <b>ParE</b> showed 33 <b>and</b> 32 % identity {{with that of the}} P. aeruginosa DNA gyrase subunits, GyrA and GyrB, respectively, and 69 and 75 % identity with that of E. coli ParC <b>and</b> <b>ParE,</b> respectively. The putative ParC <b>and</b> <b>ParE</b> proteins were overexpressed and separately purified by use of a fusion system with a maltose-binding protein, and their enzymatic properties were examined. The reconstituted enzyme had ATP-dependent decatenation activity, which is the main catalytic activity of bacterial topoisomerase IV, and relaxing activities but had no supercoiling activity. So, the cloned genes were identified as P. aeruginosa topoisomerase IV genes. The inhibitory effects of quinolones on the activities of topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase were compared. The 50 % inhibitory concentrations of quinolones for the decatenation activity of topoisomerase IV were from five to eight times higher than those for the supercoiling activities of P. aeruginosa DNA gyrase. These results confirmed that topoisomerase IV is less sensitive to fluoroquinolones than is DNA gyrase and may be a secondary target of new quinolones in wild-type P. aeruginosa...|$|R
25|$|Corporals <b>Pares</b> <b>and</b> Gill, {{were doing}} an {{excellent}} job. Gill would look through his sniper scope <b>and</b> tell <b>Pares</b> where the enemy were <b>and</b> <b>Pares</b> would fire ten rounds rapid, {{and as soon}} as that got them on the move, Gill would take them out with the sniper rifle. They took out four or five this way and all the time they were giving the rest of us a running commentary.|$|R
50|$|Having {{played for}} Randers {{during most of}} his youth career, Fisker moved to Skive IK in the fall 2007, having played in only one match for the first team in Randers. After {{successful}} spells at <b>Skive</b> <b>and</b> later Hobro IK, Fisker returned to Randers in late 2013 on a contract running two years. Fisker quickly established himself in the Randers first squad following some good performances and goals against FC Copenhagen and FC Vestsjælland during the spring season 2014.|$|R
50|$|Hyco uses a {{large number}} of {{manufacturing}} processes in order to produce their final products. The processes include rod and tube machining and grinding, custom metal machining, component machining, <b>skive</b> <b>and</b> roller burnishing, friction and inertia welding, plating, painting, and hydraulic component assembly. Robotic and CNC machines are used in many of these processes. Several plants specialize in large capacity machining and handling the very heavy, oversized components used to produce very large bore, very long stroke hydraulic rod and telescoping cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|And That's Not All... is a Bananarama videos {{compilation}} from 1984, {{which features}} the music videos {{that were to}} the singles from the Deep Sea <b>Skiving</b> <b>and</b> Bananarama albums.

He kept the nickname because, according to Cheese and Egg in episode 2.1, [...] "They're all bloody Delilahs". Another character, who appeared in all 20 episodes, was Smellie Ibbotson. He started as the scavenger on the tips but was later promoted to be Bloody Delilah's lapdog, reporting on who was <b>skiving</b> <b>and</b> what they were up to. Not everyone liked Smellie, {{not just because he}} was smelly, but also since he was difficult to understand (as he had no teeth).|$|R
