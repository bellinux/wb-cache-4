I find that less than one-third of observed price increases during model changeovers should be attributed to quality growth. This implies overall price inflation close to inflation measured by the official index.

40|$|The {{literature}} on testing {{for the presence}} of cyclical asymmetry in UK consumers' expenditure is extended via the application of nonparametric tests to data subject to a higher degree of disaggregation than considered in previous studies. The results obtained at an intermediate level of disaggregation depict a positive relationship between the durability of goods and the degree of asymmetry they exhibit. At high levels of disaggregation to specific expenditure categories, it is found that the aggregate and intermediate evidence of deepness asymmetry is driven by {{a relatively small number of}} expenditures, with almost no evidence of deepness asymmetry in non-durable categories of expenditure. Prominent among the durable and <b>semi-durable</b> <b>good</b> expenditure categories exhibiting significant positive deepness asymmetry are expenditures relating to housing fittings and communication, consistent with a degree of 'lumpiness' in expenditure which may be associated with the impact of credit rationing or threshold effects. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper verifies the {{positive}} relationship between consumer credit and the four categories of consumption spending in South Africa. The study utilised data sourced from the South African Reserve Bank for the period 1975 - 2011. The study was conducted via regression analysis to determine {{the relationship between the}} dependent and independent variables. A significant positive relationship was found between the independent variable household debt and the four categories of consumption. The results are statistically significant for non-durable and durable goods and although significant for services and <b>semi-durable</b> <b>goods,</b> the relationship is less strong in these two instances.

40|$|The {{objective}} is to investigate whether access to data on consumer confidence would have aided forecasts {{of the growth of}} the UK household expenditure over the recent period of economic crisis. A disaggregated study is performed on the basis that consideration is given not only to household spending in total but also expenditure on each of durable goods, <b>semi-durable</b> <b>goods,</b> nondurable goods and services. The empirical analysis demonstrates how modifications which are made to the harmonized indicator of the European Commission are able to enhance predictive accuracy. However, the benefit which is derived from consulting consumer survey data does not extend to an earlier interval over which the behaviour of consumer sentiment was far less volatile...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{estimates}} of the total incomes system of accounts (TISA) are provided for 1959 and 1969. They extend conventional accounts to include all consumption services produced by govern-ment and households {{as well as by}} enterprises, but define household purchases of durable and <b>semi-durable</b> <b>goods</b> as investment. Acquisitions of capital throughout the economy, intangible as well as tangible, and not only in the business sector, are included in capital accumulation along with, for tangible capital, net revaluations, that is capital gains net of increases in the general price level. Imputations are offered for nonmarket consumption and capital accumulation, most prominently in unpaid household work and education. Much of government output, particularly police services and defense, is recalculated as intermediate, along with expenses related to work, while media services, treated by the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) as business purchases of inter-mediate product, enter into TISA consumpti 6 n. Subsidies are included in the value of product, as are services of volunteers and imputations for the underpayment of military conscripts and of jurors. Separate accounts are offered for the national income and product, business, nonprofit institutions, government enterprises, government and households. The ratios of BEA to TISA Net National Product were 81. 4 percent and 76. 5 percent in 195...|$|E

Following Quesnay's analysis of economic reproduction, Marx distinguished between the economic sector producing means of production and the sectors producing consumer goods and luxuries.

40|$|Point-of-purchase {{environmental}} labeling can complement governmental environmental regulation by enabling consumers to address environmental problems via their purchasing power. Environmental labels {{can also provide}} manufacturers with an economic incentive — via consumer purchasing behavior — to create products that do less damage to the environment. These consumer-decision labels can be categorized as endorsement (“seal of approval”) labels, information-only labels, and comparative labels — which may be continuous or categorical. The Environmental Life-Cycle Rating Label (ELCRL) is a newly designed categorical comparative label for durable and <b>semi-durable</b> consumer <b>goods.</b> ELCRL is flexible and extensible and provides a very understandable way of communicating complex life-cycle environmental impacts to consumers. It can also be adapted for communicating other kinds of consumer information.

This article, investigates habit formation, durability, relative risk aversion and intertemporal substitution in consumption expenditures of Iranian households. For empirical study, at first, we constructed two weighted portfolio of the main assets return that households hold them. Then, by using generalized method of moments, we examined some models with the mentioned factors in pattern of households’ consumption for 1979 - 2012 periods. Our Empirical findings indicated that for durable goods, the effect of habit persistence dominated the effect of durability in consumption expenditures and for semi durable goods vice versa. Also, for <b>semi-durable</b> and durable <b>goods</b> the effect of durability dominated the effect of habit formation. Furthermore, {{the results indicate that}} coefficients of relative risk aversion and elasticity of intertemporal substitution are between 0. 25 to 0. 95 and 1. 05 to 4, respectively...|$|R

The objective {{of this research was}} to inform decision-makers in multinationals and domestic firms seeking investment opportunities to grow volume and margins in emerging markets. Consumer spending trends and economic data were analysed in order to assist companies to identify products and service categories (“winners”) to compete in within selected emerging markets. A literature review was followed by quantitative analysis of consumer spending trends in seventeen emerging markets selected from low-income, middle-income and upper-middle-income economies, as classified by the World Bank. Visual representation and inspection, as well as descriptive statistics of the data, were followed by statistical analysis. The paired sample t-test, the Wilcoxon test and stepwise regression techniques were used to test the research questions. The findings suggest that the services category, specifically education and medical services, gained significant share of consumer spending. The durable goods category share remained flat and generic “losers” emerged mainly from the non-durable goods and <b>semi-durable</b> <b>goods</b> sub-categories. It seems as though few generic winners and losers exist and that a country-by-country analysis needs to be conducted. Dissertation (MBA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|With all the {{excitement}} in South Africa about the 2010 FIFA World Cup kicking off on 11 June 2010, tax relief will be granted on import tax and VAT, amongst others, {{in terms of the}} Revenue Laws Amendment Act 20 of 2006 (hereafter referred to as RLAA). FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association), confirmed that SAFA may have the right to serve as a host for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, but in order to qualify 17 guarantees were to be given by South African government to FIFA which is a general requirement for all host cities. These guarantees will be provided by various government departments focusing on the financial environment, safety and security, intellectual property and marketing rights, transport and telecommunications as well as custom duties, other taxes and duties and levies by the Minister of Finance. The government of The Republic of South Africa issued several guarantees that they would comply with to meet certain requirements set out by FIFA for World Cup hosts (Wilson, 2008 : 1). These include, inter alia, the provision of taxation relief for qualifying individuals and entities. Trevor Manuel, former Minister of Finance, included certain provisions in the RLAA, to give effect to FIFA’s requirements. The RLAA created a tax-free bubble around the FIFA-designated sites so that profits on consumable and <b>semi-durable</b> <b>goods</b> sold within these areas will not be subject to Income tax; nor will VAT be levied. Tax relief will be given on specific goods and services for qualifying taxpayers, as defined in the Income Tax Act 58 / 1962 ("The Income Tax Act"), (Wilson, 2008 : 1). This relief system will be governed by an accompanying abuse paragraph in the legislation in order to limit any loss that may be suffered by the South African Revenue Service ("SARS"). The positive and negative impacts, which will arise from hosting such an international event, are important to discuss and consider...|$|E
40|$|Defence date: 24 June 2011 Examining Board: Bartolomé Yun-Casalilla, {{supervisor}} (European University Institute), Luca Molà (European University Institute), Jan De Vries (University of California at Berkeley), Gerard Chastagnaret (Université de Provence) How {{to focus}} {{the analysis of the}} birth of mass consumption society has been a scholarly obsession over the last few decades. This thesis suggests that an analytical approach must be taken in studies on consumption paying special attention to the socio-cultural and economic transfers which occur when different commodities are introduced to territories with diverse socio-cultural values and identities. Therefore one of the key questions of such an analysis is to examine the role of merchants, who have a very important influence on consumer decisions. This thesis describes the new necessities created by merchants, as “vicarious consumers”, inserted in local, national and international market circuits in the Western Mediterranean area. The increase in the consumption of new goods during the eighteenth century in south-eastern Spain, especially {{during the second half of}} the century, entailed changes in household economies through some improvements in everyday life. The systematic analysis of probate inventories demonstrates potential shifts in the consumption of new durable and <b>semi-durable</b> <b>goods</b> in urban and rural families. Certainly, in south-eastern Spain, there was an interest in consuming new, exotic and foreign goods. The desires, aspirations and choices of individuals are demonstrated to have been inspired by a global movement, in which human and material capital circulated trans-continentally, shifting the patterns of consumption of societies - whose values and traditions were challenged by the acquisition of new material goods. I will not simply analyse those relevant theories applied to material culture studies related to Occidental or Oriental societies, such as the “industrious revolution” or “trickle-down” approaches (which have been applied mostly in developed economies to explain stages prior to the Industrial Revolution process). Instead, by observing a southern European society, such as Spain, where the industrialization process was slower than that in Anglo-Saxon territories, we may determine whether both theories occurred simultaneously or separately; identify what the socio-economic forces and agents that prompted the stimulus for new consumer aspirations were; and understand the cultural consequences that the new modern consumerism brought about...|$|E

First made {{available}} online 28 July 2010, subsequently withdrawn (23 / 01 / 2012) on publisher and author request; {{made available}} again 20 July 2017. Most studies of pre-industrial economic and structural change {{focus on the}} economically leading regions or countries of the time, or use this development as an ideal by which to evaluate and compare change occurring in other countries. By doing so the scholarly debate loses sight of the many possible roads to economic development, as well neglecting the changes occurring in other less successful regions. This thesis aims at abating this. It will do so by examining the structural and economic changes which occurred in Norway during the pre-industrial period, a country lying in {{the outskirts of the}} European economic growth area. It asks what were the implications of changes in production, the gradual development of a Norwegian internal market, decisions made at the household level concerning market participation, as well as changing trends in the consumption of durable, <b>semi-durable</b> and perishable <b>goods,</b> for economic and social development in Norway. It also examines how these changes impacted on Norway’s later Industrialisation and entry into a modern market economy. The time period focused on is primarily 1750 to 1830...|$|R
