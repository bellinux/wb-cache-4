It is focused on sociocultural and historical context of New Zealand and accents local pre-school system. The central theme is a game (play) as a specific culture phenomenon. The theoretical part is devided into five basic chapters. First chapter applys to settlement history and New Zealand geography in context of Pacific Ocean. Second chapter considers in detail way original culture of New Zealand - Mori. Attention is paid mainly to its arrival to New Zealand, to its structure, to its pre- and post-colonisation history and also to current <b>sociopolitical</b> <b>aspect</b> of its life facing Europeans in New Zealand. Third chapter aims to present the therm 'enculturation' in a wider cross-disciplinary context accenting attachment theory, American anthropological school 'personhood and culture', sociohistorical development of a family and a process of socialization. Fourth chapter is focused on a game (play), its classification, typology and its development. Fifth chapter presents the history of anthropological field research as an introduction to empirical part of this Diploma Thesis. In the empirical part is presented proper research investigation carried out in New Zealand during summer semester 2008 [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective: In {{the current}} situation, {{it seems that}} {{municipal}} solid waste recycling despite hygienic, economic and environmental aspects is important from <b>sociopolitical</b> <b>aspect.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to determine waste recycling condition and the knowledge of households about resistive economics, as an action along with a policy. Materials and Methods : This descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted among 330 family of Amirkola city in Mazandaran province during 2013. The samples were collected from 33 regions using cluster sampling method. The data was collected by means of researcher-made data collection sheet and analyzed using descriptive statistical indices and Chi- square test, and p< 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results : The results showed that the mean (SD) of age were 39. 1 (10. 9) years and 176 (53 %) female. More than half of households (56. 9 %) were recycling municipal solid waste (plastic, paper, glass, and food residue) which the share of plastic, and paper were the highest. Only 59 (29 %) were familiar with resistive economics, but there was not any significant relation between waste recycling and their awareness of resistive economics. Conclusion : The limitation of knowledge about resistive economics, and their weakness of practice about waste recycling imply that the authorities should have definite programs in order to increase family information and participations in social issues. </p...|$|E

Methods: Thematic analysis of relevant data from fifty-nine media articles, thirty-nine discussion forums, thirteen blogs, and three facebook pages relating to our case study: Public funding for assisted reproductive technology services. Mainstream media and community-based social media responses were compared. Results: Media responses were narrow, primarily describing emotive individual narratives or the political nexus of interests. Community (including patient) responses were broader including discussion of opportunity cost and vested interests but mostly reflected the polar ends of the debate, diverging strongly for or against disinvestment from public funding. Conclusion: Web 2. 0 and media analysis offers an inexpensive method to capture media portrayal, divergent community responses both to that portrayal and independent of it, and insight into the <b>sociopolitical</b> <b>aspects</b> of an entrenched technology undergoing disinvestment debate...|$|R

In October 1838, the government consummated the re-acceptance of Iturbide into the pantheon of heroes with an elaborate public reburial in the National Cathedral of Mexico City. Iturbide's reburial was less about forgiving past indiscretions than about bringing legitimacy to the current political party in power.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{transformation}} of the Buddhist technique of mindfulness as it is applied in psychotherapy. It is based on primarily on the experience of a Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course as taught in Montreal in 2015, as well as some prior experiences of mindfulness meditation at the Palyul Center and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in Ottawa. Written as an auto-ethnography, the thesis provides an intimate first hand immersion experience into mindfulness meditation through a phenomenological approach in anthropology. The <b>sociopolitical</b> <b>aspects</b> of MBSR are also discussed through a related Deleuzo-Guattarian framework. The central argument of the thesis is that while effective in the management of stress MBSR fails to address deeper and more severe forms of suffering, stressing the management of emotions rather than their exploration. This fact coupled with the omission of the Buddhist concept of no-independent self and training in mindfulness results in MBSR being a territorializing force of self-surveillance and a social pacifier. The question emerging from this exploration brings us to revisit the role of ethics in the application mindfulness in therapy...|$|R

This article carves out the place of secession in international law by appeal to fundamental principles and legal doctrine. It also explores major <b>sociopolitical</b> <b>aspects</b> in Kosovo's history, from the battle of Kosovo Polje in 1389 to Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) that set up the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). By following these two analytical paths Kosovo is exposed as a case of remedial secession and thus as a potential legal precedent. While the elements of remedial secession are gathered, {{it is argued that}} states deprived this instance of practice of its precedential value and made it a legally insignificant act. In other words, the international community missed a rare opportunity to clarify the concept of remedial secession and to reassert its preventive force as a non-traditional human rights protection mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of postwar welfare states in Europe is usually {{understood as a}} social and political phenomenon, as a social policy to prevent against forms of mass poverty and to grant general social rights and entitlements to populations {{during a period of}} rising prosperity. Beyond these <b>sociopolitical</b> <b>aspects,</b> the foundation of systems of social security after 1945 also had important cultural and epistemic implications. The promise of the state to provide a generalized form of security represented an important cultural factor in securing the social and political stability of postwar societies in Europe. This article examines some exemplary aspects of the meaning of social security by tracing their historical roots and their effects on postwar welfare states in Western Europe. In order to chart the various, interconnected cultural meanings of social security, it juxtaposes two institutional contexts in which social security and prevention were discussed: an international organization of social security experts and a Swiss life insurance company with an innovative health promotion service. The article shows how security was seen ultimately as an utopian response to the multiplication of risks and damages through the processes of industrialization and modernization and thus reveal...|$|R
40|$|To {{contribute}} {{to the study of}} patriarchal correction in the remediation of Canadian letters, this dissertation explicated some of the key transformations which Yves Simoneau's film adaptation made to the feminist critique of patriarchal society inscribed in Anne Hébert's novel Les Fous de Bassan. To accomplish this task, I did comparative close readings using analytical concepts applied by feminist literary and historical theorists, such as Diana Fuss, Marilyn French, Adrienne Rich, Gerda Lerner and Rosalind Coward. To unmask subtle as well as obvious transformations, I considered symbolic, psychological, structural and <b>sociopolitical</b> <b>aspects</b> of the two texts and paid attention to the cinematic creation of meaning. The study of the film adaptation found a vast array of deviations from the novel that, in large measure, either attenuated, sidelined, cut or otherwise undid the source text's underlying critique of the fate of women in patriarchy and their concomitant resistance to their social situation. Because of the highly targeted nature of the modifications and the non-cinematic explanations for most of the transmutations, I conclude that Simoneau makes them largely for ideological reasons, which situates the adaptation within the social backlash against feminism of the 1980 's...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines mobility practices among hunter-gatherer {{groups who}} inhabited the Cis-Baikal region of Siberia (Russia) during prehistory, using archaeological and geochemical data. I argue that {{new methods of}} assessing human mobility enable insights into other aspects of social organization, including political structure, and employ these data to test hypotheses about mobility and <b>sociopolitical</b> <b>aspects</b> of Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age life ways. I also describe {{the results of a}} large-scale examination of jade (nephrite) ornaments from Early Bronze Age burials throughout the Cis-Baikal region and in neighboring areas of Eurasia. These objects provide a novel means of understanding status competition and macro-regional interaction through prestige goods exchange among hunter-gatherers, and illuminate previously unseen differences in dominant political strategies that local groups employed throughout the Cis-Baikal. I then present archaeological evidence from broader Eurasian contexts to assess the involvement of Cis-Baikal hunter-gatherer groups in the larger Bronze Age, and demonstrate that meaningful interconnections developed during this period. Finally, I present possible political economic mechanisms as well as specific venues that may have enabled local actors within the Cis-Baikal to produce sociopolitical changes documented here...|$|R
40|$|The author aims {{to analyze}} the {{correctness}} of the widespread deﬁnition of the socioeconomic worldview of Sergey Nikolaevich Bulgakov (1871 – 1944) as «socialistic». With this purpose, the author outlines Bulgakov’s socio-economic theory of the ﬁ rst {{decade of the twentieth}} century — the period of his most evident «socialistic» statements. The author analyzes both his economic and political views in connection with socialist teachings as well as his sociological understanding of the roles of state and society. The study shows that during this period, Bulgakov, mainly working from the idea of civil society as an active counterweight to the state, establishes his notion of «Christian community» or «Church community», functioning as a religiously and personally motivated open space for the formation of public opinion, as the sociological concept of civil society. Special attention is given to an analysis of Bulgakov’s hierarchical theory of values which, from the philosophical and theoretical points of view, ensures openness and non-dogmatism in the «Church community» as the place of nurture of social ideals, in the author’s opinion. As a result, it is concluded that Bulgakov’s socio-economic theory of the period went beyond the paradigm of socialism especially in its <b>sociopolitical</b> <b>aspects</b> and retains its relevance to the present day...|$|R

40|$|Stakeholder {{engagement}} and dialogue have {{a central role}} in defining the relations between organisations and their internal and external interlocutors. Drawing upon the analysis of dialogic motifs, power–conflict dynamics and sociopolitical perspectives, and based on a set of interviews with the stakeholders of a consumer-owned cooperative, the research explores the dialogic potential of stakeholder engagement. The analysis revealed a fragmented picture where the co-design and co-implementation aspects were mainly related to the non-business areas of cooperative life, while business logic dominated the most central aspects. Stakeholder engagement was mainly related to consensus building, while dialogic engagement based on a pluralistic understanding was only partially considered and then neglected. The social capital in the local area, the growing size of the organisation and the related power structure embrace stakeholder engagement, influencing the orientation of the (un) dialogic dynamic. The analysis indicates that a dialogic exchange is a relative concept which depends on the interests involved and the topics discussed. It also reveals that the key factors in the democratisation of stakeholder engagement are a mutual understanding and long-term opportunities. Common <b>sociopolitical</b> <b>aspects</b> are also important, but they do not necessarily guarantee the creation of dialogism paths. The research contributes to the critical dialogic literature in revealing whether and how stakeholder engagement has been implemented in a specific setting. It also shows the limitations of voluntarist stakeholder engagement initiatives...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{indicators}} are produced and used worldwide; across all levels and sectors of society; by public, private {{and civil society}} actors; {{for a variety of}} purposes, ranging from knowledge-provision to administrative control. While the use of quantitative data as policy support, including policy formulation, has a long history, recent decades have seen the rise of what some have called an ‘indicator industry’ (for example, Hezri and Hasan 2004), focused especially on the production of environmental and sustainability indicators, within a framework variously called ‘governance by numbers' (Miller 2001; Lascoumes and Le Galès 2005; Jackson 2011), ‘management by numbers’ in public service (for example, Hood 2007) or ‘numbers discourse’ (Jackson 2011, p. 23). Indicators are generally expected to enhance the rationality of policymaking and public debate by providing a supposedly more objective, robust, and reliable information base. Indicators can operate as ‘boundary objects’ (for example, Turnhout 2009; Star 2010), catering to both technocratic and deliberative ideals, by combining ‘hard facts’ and modelling with collective reasoning and ‘speculation’. Research and development work in the area has hitherto overwhelmingly concentrated on improving the technical quality of indicators, while the fate of indicators in policymaking and the associated <b>sociopolitical</b> <b>aspects</b> have attracted little attention. This chapter focuses on this neglected area of indicator research, by providing an overview of the multiple types of existing indicators, as well as their use and influence in various venues of policymaking.

5000|$|The International Association of Accessibility Professionals [...] recognizes six {{different}} models for conceptualizing disability: social, medical, cultural affilitation, economic, charity, and functional solutions. Once universally {{accepted in the}} field, the social model of disability [...] has recently been challenged. In a 2014 Disability Studies Quarterly article, students involved in campus disability drops note that they actively seek cures for their chronic illnesses and [...] "question {{the rejection of the}} medical model" [...] of disability. The cultural affiliation model accepts the person's disability completely, and uses it a point of pride in being associated with other people in a similar condition. The economic model recognizes the effect of bodily limitations on a person’s ability to work, and there may be a need for economic support and/or accommodations for the person’s disability [...] while the charity model regards people with disabilities as unfortunate and in need of assistance from the outside, with those providing charity viewed as benevolent contributors to a needy population. The functional solutions model of disability is a practical perspective that identifies the limitations (or [...] "functional impairments") due to disability, with the intent to create and promote solutions to overcome those limitations. The primary task is to eliminate, or at least reduce, the impact of the functional limitations of the body through technological or methodological innovation. The pragmatism of the functional solution model deemphasizes the <b>sociopolitical</b> <b>aspects</b> of disability, and instead prioritizes inventiveness and entrepreneurship. This is the prevailing opinion behind compliance literature that promotes self-efficacy and self-advocacy skills for people with disabilities preparing for transition to independent living.|$|R
40|$|The {{negotiations}} for the Mid-Term Review of the Fourth Lome Convention marked {{the introduction of}} multiple conditionality - economic adjustment and good governance - into the Lome relationship. It placed additional demands on the two parties, giving rise to the essential concern of this thesis: do the two sides possess the requisite institutional capacity to meet those demands. The introduction was not a sudden development. The origins of multiple conditionality lay in the Pisani Memorandum and its proposal of policy dialogue. The path from the proposal to multiple conditionality was assisted by developments within the Lome relationship, including the unintended effects of ACP initiatives. This thesis is thus, in one sense, {{the history of the}} Memorandum's legacy of inverted conditionality through policy dialogue. It is also an analysis of the capacities generated by the Convention and their applicability to multiple conditionality. My analysis of bargaining, operational and instrumental capacities demonstrates a weak ACP capacity and an asymmetrically greater EU capacity. My initial conclusion is that the EU is much more capable of meeting the demands of multiple conditionality. However, it too faces limits on its capacity, especially in dealing with the <b>sociopolitical</b> <b>aspects</b> of governance. This recognition highlights an ignored factor: there is a second legacy of the Pisani Memorandum. In addition to the instrument of policy dialogue, the Memorandum identified institutional capacity as the means to help overcome the problems of development. The new tale of two legacies illustrates an EU emphasis on policy control at the expense of capacity building. It has failed to perceive the importance of the link, in the Pisani Memorandum, between the instrument and the means. It forces me to amend my initial conclusion: neither side is adequately prepared for the demands of multiple conditionality...|$|R
40|$|Plankhouses were {{functionally}} and symbolically {{integral to}} Northwest Coast societies, {{as much of}} economic and social life was predicated on these dwellings. This thesis investigates both plankhouse architecture and the production of these dwellings. Studying plankhouse construction and maintenance provides information regarding everyday labor, landscape use outside of villages, organization of complex tasks, and resource management. This thesis investigates three plankhouse structures at two sites, Meier and Cathlapotle, in the Lower Columbia River Region of the southern Northwest Coast of North America. Methods consisted of digitizing over 1, 100 architectural features, creating detailed maps of architectural features, and conducting statistical and spatial analysis of these features. I use ethnographies, historical documents, experimental archaeology, and ecological studies to characterize the processes of plankhouse production. This information is combined with excavation data from Cathlapotle and Meier to calculate estimates of material and labor required for plankhouse-related activities. Results of this study support previous inferences regarding house architecture, construction and maintenance at the two sites. Structural elements were frequently replaced, yet overall house appearance changed little over time. Some differences in structural element use and size are noted between the two sites, suggesting that slightly different building techniques may have been employed at the two villages. Although approximate, calculations of raw materials and person days required for various building tasks provide a glimpse of the massive undertaking entailed in constructing and maintaining plankhouses. These data suggest that an enormous amount of trees were required for construction and maintenance over house occupation, approximately 700 - 1, 200 trees at Meier, 900 - 2, 000 trees at Cathlapotle House 1, and 150 - 400 trees at Cathlapotle House 4. Estimates of minimum person days entailed for tasks related to initial construction range from 1, 400 - 2, 800 at Meier, to 2, 100 - 4, 500 at Cathlapotle House 1, to 350 - 700 at Cathlapotle House 4. In highlighting the articulation of plankhouse labor with household reproduction, this thesis demonstrates the important interplay between material outputs, everyday action, and <b>sociopolitical</b> <b>aspects</b> of Northwest Coast society...|$|R
