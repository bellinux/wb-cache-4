40|$|In this lecture {{we address}} three {{different}} but related {{aspects of the}} initial continuous fluctuation field in <b>standard</b> <b>cosmological</b> <b>models.</b> Firstly we discuss {{the properties of the}} so-called Harrison-Zeldovich like spectra. This power spectrum is a fundamental feature of all current <b>standard</b> <b>cosmological</b> <b>models.</b> In a simple classification of all stationary stochastic processes into three categories, we highlight with the name ``super-homogeneous'' the properties of the class to which models like this, with $P(0) = 0 $, belong. In statistical physics language they are well described as glass-like. Secondly, the initial continuous density field with such small amplitude correlated Gaussian fluctuations must be discretised in order to set up the initial particle distribution used in gravitational N-body simulations. We discuss the main issues related to the effects of discretisation, particularly concerning the effect of particle induced fluctuations on the statistical properties of the initial conditions and on the dynamical evolution of gravitational clustering.

50|$|The {{critical}} question {{for all three}} writers was whether the new phenomenon could be explained within the generally-accepted model of the universe, known as the Aristotelian model or the Ptolmaic system.

An unusual event in the sky might take place close to the earth, and could therefore be explained within the <b>standard</b> <b>cosmological</b> <b>model.</b> However if it took place beyond the planets, this indicated that the stars, contrary to what was commonly believed, could not be fixed in a 'firmament'.

50|$|The Jesuit China {{missions}} {{of the sixteenth}} and seventeenth centuries brought Western astronomy, then undergoing its own revolution, to China and—via João Rodrigues's gifts to Jeong Duwon—to Joseon Korea. After the Galileo affair early in the seventeenth century, the Roman Catholic Jesuit order was required to adhere to geocentrism and ignore the heliocentric teachings of Copernicus and his followers, even though they were becoming standard in European astronomy. Thus, the Jesuits initially shared an Earth-centered and largely pre-Copernican astronomy with their Chinese hosts (i.e., the Ptolemaic-Aristotelian views from Hellenistic times). The Jesuits (such as Giacomo Rho) later introduced Tycho's geoheliocentric model as the <b>standard</b> <b>cosmological</b> <b>model.</b> The Chinese often were fundamentally opposed to this as well, since the Chinese had long believed (from the ancient doctrine of Xuan Ye) that the celestial bodies floated in a void of infinite space.
