In this report, we present the interesting case of a patient with chronic, massive, localised lymphedema of her left labia majora that was resected in 2011. Five years later, she presented with squamous cell carcinoma over the left vulva region, which is rarely associated with chronic lymphedema. To the best of our knowledge, our management of the radical vulvectomy defect with a labia majora <b>sharing</b> <b>procedure</b> is novel and has not been previously described. The labia major flap presented in this report is a shared flap; that is, a transposition flap based on the dorsal clitoral artery, which has consistent vascular anatomy, making this flap durable and reliable. This procedure epitomises the principle of replacing like with like, does not interfere with leg movement or patient positioning, has minimal donor site morbidity, and preserves other locoregional flap options for future reconstruction. One limitation is the need for a lax contralateral vulva. This labia majora <b>sharing</b> <b>procedure</b> is a viable option in carefully selected patients...|$|R

The online survey for R&D managers in 15 European countries was carried out for analyzing these research topics. We apply regression models and a full structural equation model (SEM) by LISREL for empirical analysis. The results show that subsidiary’s internal position of R&D importance encourages them to diffuse more knowledge for the whole MNEs.

40|$|Sebaceous gland {{carcinoma}} is an aggressive, uncommon, cutaneous malignancy. This tumour {{can arise}} {{anywhere in the}} body; approximately 75 % of these tumours arise in the periocular region. The diagnosis and management of these malignancies often tend to get delayed because they are frequently mistaken for more common benign entities. Surgery has been and remains the primary treatment modality for sebaceous gland carcinomas. The resultant surgical defects following tumour excision generally tend to be full thickness and reconstructions of such defects pose significant challenges. These defects are conventionally reconstructed by the traditional bridging (eyelid <b>sharing)</b> <b>procedures,</b> that is, the Cutler-Beard flap and its modifications. The ‘Switch flap’ is an alternative eyelid sharing procedure; however, it is not very widely practiced.

40|$|We see {{increased}} use of existing observational data {{in order to achieve}} fast and transparent production of empirical evidence in health care research. Multiple databases are often used to increase power, to assess rare exposures or outcomes, or to study diverse populations. For privacy and sociological reasons, original data on individual subjects can't be shared, requiring a distributed network approach where data processing is performed prior to data sharing. We created a conceptual framework distinguishing three steps in local data processing: (1) data reorganization into a data structure common across the network; (2) derivation of study variables not present in original data; and (3) application of study design to transform longitudinal data into aggregated data sets for statistical analysis. We applied this framework to four case studies to identify similarities and differences in the United States and Europe: Exploring and Understanding Adverse Drug Reactions by Integrative Mining of Clinical Records and Biomedical Knowledge (EU-ADR), Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP), the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Mini-Sentinel, and the Italian network-the Integration of Content Management Information on the Territory of Patients with Complex Diseases or with Chronic Conditions (MATRICE). National networks (OMOP, Mini-Sentinel, MATRICE) all adopted <b>shared</b> <b>procedures</b> for local data reorganization. The multinational EU-ADR network needed locally defined procedures to reorganize its heterogeneous data into a common structure. Derivation of new data elements was centrally defined in all networks but the <b>procedure</b> was not <b>shared</b> in EU-ADR.

30|$|Nevertheless, in the {{learning}} network processes, there are issues of learning policies and programs (Poell et al. 2000; Van der Krogt, 1998). The development of learning policies refers to influencing {{the general direction of}} {{the learning}} network, that is, what people should learn and in what way they should learn it; the development of learning programs comprises the making of coherent sets of activities in which people learn (Poell et al. 2000). In SMEs’ networking, there are inequalities of control and power, and differing views and motives which influence and shape learning (Antonacopoulou and Chiva, 2007). A network perspective allows a discussion of asymmetric learning relationships where inequalities of control and power serve as stabilizing and controlling force in the network (Higgins et al., 2013), and allows learning outcomes in expanded forms, such as the exchanges of tacit knowledge, a network identity, or common values and rules about <b>sharing</b> <b>procedure</b> knowledge.|$|R

Balanced games are those having a nonempty core, and this core is usually considered as the solution of the game. Based on the concept of $k$-additivity, we define the so-called $k$-balanced games and the corresponding generalization of core, the $k$-additive core, whose elements are not directly imputations but $k$-additive games. We show that any game is $k$-balanced for a suitable choice of $k,$ so that the corresponding $k$-additive core is not empty. For the games in the $k$-additive core, we propose a <b>sharing</b> <b>procedure</b> to get an imputation and a representative value for the expectations of the players based on the pessimistic criterion. Moreover, we look for necessary and sufficient conditions for a game to be $k$-balanced. For the general case, it is shown that any game is either balanced or 2 -balanced.

Our aim was to find whether they can transfer their understanding of logical relations from discrete to continuous quantities though the <b>procedures</b> used in <b>sharing</b> these quantities are markedly different. Two samples of 5 - to 7 -year-olds participated in two studies. In the first study, the items involved partitive division; in the second, quotitive division tasks. In both studies, the children solved tasks with discrete and continuous quantities. Performance varied significantly across age level and logical principle (equivalence between different rounds of sharing versus inverse relation between the divisor and the quotient) but not across type of quantity (discrete versus continuous). There was a very strong relation between performance across type of quantity. We conclude that children can generalise reasoning principles in division across type of quantity in spite of the difference in <b>sharing</b> <b>procedures.</b> © 2005 Elsevier Inc.
