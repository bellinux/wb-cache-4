60|$|I {{think the}} {{feature of the}} day was the sight of two flying-fish that just missed {{boarding}} the boat. They came out to the left of us and sailed ahead together. Then they must have been turned by the wind, for they made a beautiful, graceful curve until they came around so that I was sure they would fly into the boat. Their motion was indescribably airy and feathery, buoyant and swift, with not the slightest quiver of fins or wings as they passed within five feet of me. I could see through the crystal wings. Their bodies were white and silvery, and they had staring black eyes. They were not so large as the California flying-fish, nor did they have any blue color. They resembled the California species, however, in that same strange, hunted look which always struck me. To see these flying-fish this way was provocative of thought. They had been pursued by some hungry devil of a fish, and with a birdlike swiftness with which nature had marvelously endowed them they had escaped the enemy. Here I had at once the wonder and beauty and terror of the sea. These fish were not leaping with joy. I have not often seen fish in the salt water perform antics for anything except flight or pursuit. Sometimes kingfish appear to be playing when they leap so wonderfully at sunset hour, but as a rule <b>salt-water</b> <b>fish</b> {{do not seem to be}} playful.|$|E
60|$|It is {{probable}} that they are occasionally transported by what may be called accidental means. Thus fishes still alive are not very rarely dropped at distant points by whirlwinds; and {{it is known that}} the ova retain their vitality for a considerable time after removal from the water. Their dispersal may, however, be mainly attributed to changes in the level of the land within the recent period, causing rivers to flow into each other. Instances, also, could be given of this having occurred during floods, without any change of level. The wide differences of the fish on the opposite sides of most mountain-ranges, which are continuous and consequently must, from an early period, have completely prevented the inosculation of the river systems on the two sides, leads to the same conclusion. Some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms, and in such cases there will have been ample time for great geographical changes, and consequently time and means for much migration. Moreover, Dr. Gunther has recently been led by several considerations to infer that with fishes the same forms have a long endurance. <b>Salt-water</b> <b>fish</b> can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water; and, according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a single group of which all the members are confined to fresh water, so that a marine species belonging to a fresh-water group might travel far along the shores of the sea, and could, it {{is probable}}, become adapted without much difficulty to the fresh waters of a distant land.|$|E
60|$|But {{this power}} in fresh-water {{productions}} of ranging widely, though so unexpected, can, I think, {{in most cases}} be explained by their having become fitted, in a manner highly useful to them, for short and frequent migrations from pond to pond, or from stream to stream; and liability to wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessary consequence. We can here consider only a few cases. In regard to fish, I believe that the same species never occur in the fresh waters of distant continents. But on the same continent the species often range widely and almost capriciously; for two river-systems will have some fish in common and some different. A few facts seem to favour the possibility of their occasional transport by accidental means; {{like that of the}} live fish not rarely dropped by whirlwinds in India, and the vitality of their ova when removed from the water. But I am inclined to attribute the dispersal of fresh-water fish mainly to slight changes within the recent period in the level of the land, having caused rivers to flow into each other. Instances, also, could be given of this having occurred during floods, without any change of level. We have evidence in the loess of the Rhine of considerable changes of level in the land within a very recent geological period, and when the surface was peopled by existing land and fresh-water shells. The wide difference of the fish on opposite sides of continuous mountain-ranges, which from an early period must have parted river-systems and completely prevented their inosculation, seems to lead to this same conclusion. With respect to allied fresh-water fish occurring at very distant points of the world, no doubt there are many cases which cannot at present be explained: but some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms, and in such cases there will have been ample time for great geographical changes, and consequently time and means for much migration. In the second place, <b>salt-water</b> <b>fish</b> can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water; and, according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a single group of fishes confined exclusively to fresh water, so that we may imagine that a marine member of a fresh-water group might travel far along the shores of the sea, and subsequently become modified and adapted to the fresh waters of a distant land.|$|E

The Tampa Bay Hotel cost approximately 2. 5 million dollars to build and $ 500, 000 to furnish.

Most of the rooms had their own baths and all had electricity and telephones. In addition, guests were surrounded by a varied collection of furniture, porcelains, Venetian-style mirrors, and sculptures gathered by Mr. and Mrs. Plant in their travels in Europe. The Tampa Bay Hotel opened in 1891 amid wide fanfare and celebration. Henry Plant's dream was now a reality. The newspapers of the day described it as "brightly illuminated, filled with sumptuous decorations, thrilling music and graced with turrets, domes and minarets towering heavenward and glistening in the sun. " It was a Victorian palace. The hotel was a lively place with balls, tea parties, and organized hunts during the winter social season. It was open seasonally from December to April in the 1890 's.

We assessed whether fresh water occupancy of black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) can be inferred from otolith barium concentrations (Ba was standardized to calcium (Ca) and expressed as a ratio, Ba:Ca). Otolith Ba:Ca of fish was correlated with ambient Ba:Ca. Using the natural relationships of increasing ambient and otolith Ba:Ca with decreasing salinity, fish from fresh- and salt-water environments were distinguishable. Fish caught in fresh water had approximately double the otolith Ba:Ca of those from salt-water estuaries, for both summer and winter collections. Fish with otolith Ba:Ca ≤ 5 µmol·mol– 1 were classified as resident in salt water, and those with ≥ 6 µmol·mol– 1 as resident in fresh water. Transects of Ba:Ca across fish otoliths classified fish to fresh- or <b>salt-water</b> environments. <b>Fish</b> were identified as having migratory patterns typical of residents, migrants with irregular patterns of diadromy, or migrants with cyclic patterns of anadromomy.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Six {{cases of}} Mycobacierium marinum infections of the deeper sfruc tures {{of the hand}} are {{described}} which clinically and histologically were indistin guishable from tuberculosis.

The organism must be suspected and then cultured at 30 to 32 degrees centigrade {{instead of the usual}} 37 degrees. Chronic infections of the hand can be a baffling problem to the treating physi cian as well as a disabling condition for the involved patient. Mycobacterium mar mum infections of the hand have been mistaken for gout, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic pyogenic infections and are clinically and histologically indistinguishable from tuberculosis. One should have a high index of suspicion of Mycobacterium mar mum infections when there is a history of abrasion in contaminated water or a punc ture wound from marine life. The diagnosis should be established by culturing sus pect tissue on Lowenstein-Jensen's medium at 30 to 32 degrees centigrade rather than at 37 degrees centigrade (as for tuberculosis and other acid-fast bacilli).

They were lyophilized upon their arrival in the laboratory before lipid analyses. FA composition of food lipids was determined by capillary gas chromatography. Staple diets included low-fat, high-carbohydrate foods (processed cassava roots, wheat bread) and high-polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) foods : soybean oil (high in 18 : 2 n- 6 and alpha- 18 : 3 n- 3), bushbutter (#Dacryodes edulis$), peanuts, avocado (high in fat and 18 : 2 n- 6), freshwater and <b>salt-water</b> <b>fish</b> (high in LC n- 3 and/or n- 6 PUFA) and leafy green vegetables (low in fat but very high in alpha- 18 : 3 n- 3).

40|$|During {{the last}} 10 {{years we have}} been experimenting in the {{laboratory}} at the Flødevigen Sea-Fish Hatchery with the rearing of several species of <b>salt-water</b> <b>fishes.</b> The intention has been to bring about better methods for experimental purposes and to get some information as to what factors may be of importance {{for the survival of}} the eggs and larvae in nature. In this paper we are dealing with herring, cod, and plaice, especially the results from the two last seasons. In order to attain success when rearing fish-larvae, especially those species having an air-bladder, it is important to control the gas content of the sea-water. It is essential that when larvae are reared in small aquaria at a pressure of but one atmosphere the gas content of the seawater must be kept relatively low. It is assumed that the gas pressure and not the content of gas is the chief factor. Larvae living in the sea at a water pressure of e. g. 10 metres will probably sustain a gas content in the sea-water which will be detrimental near the surface. In this connection it is worth mentioning that the young cod-larvae react at once to changes in water pressure. When the water pressure is about 5 metres the larvae in a closed aquarium will keep to the surface. When the water pressure is shut off the larvae will straightaway sink apathetic to the bottom, but swim up again when the water pressure once more is put on. Experiments indicate that cod-larvae with a big air-bladder may recover when they are transferred to an aquarium covered with silk net and lowered to a depth of 5 to 10 metres. The eggs of the pelagic spring spawners are not affected by reasonable variations in the gas content. If the gas content is not reduced in the aquaria the larvae will get gas-bubbles in the intestines. This does not occur till the yolk-sack is resorbed - and the intestines and gills are functioning. It is assumed that the gas is liberated when the sea-water passes the gills. Small gasbubbles are formed inside and swallowed. In the case of herring the gas-bubbles are fatal. In the plaice the gas-bubbles will pass through the anus - and are not likely to harm the young. In the case of the cod we have not observed the gas to be within the intestines. In early stages - about a week after the resorbtion of the yolk-sack - the gas occurs free in the cavity. The intestines may be ruptured-or the gas may originate from the early air-bladder. In older stages the air-bladder will expand, the young will turn belly upwards and die, or the air-bladder may be ruptured. In older stages of the plaice - up to a length of some centimetres at least - fine gasbubbles rnay accumulate in the veins, and the fish will succumb. In the laboratory the gas content may be reduced by filtering the sea-water slowly through fine sand. Great quantities of gas will accumulate in the sand. The composition of this gas O²/N² is somewhat the same as in the atmosphere, the content of oxygen being slightly higher. Some of the gas in the sea-water in the laboratory may originate from the atmosphere - by leakage in the pump bearings. Studies of the gas of the air-bladder of cod (by Miss Eva Henly) indicate that oxygen is the operative factor. The results of the rearing experiments have improved to a very high degree after the gas problem was taken into consideration. The larvae of herring, cod, and plaice (and other flat-fishes) will thrive for weeks in the small aquaria used, containing but 35 litres. The flat-fishes are ordinarily reared without any mortality to the bottom stage in numbers from 1 to 3 thousands in the same aquarium. In this way the critical period - the moment when feeding begins - has been overcome. Experiments have shown that the cod-larvae may live in filtered water - without food - for several days after the yolk-sack is resorbed, and still thrive when fed. If we want to rear the fish further we encounter other problems. Will the feeding with the nauplii of Artemia be sufficient in the long run? Do they contain enough vitamins? Experiments have been made to feed the nauplii with flagellate cultures for some days before giving them to the young fish. Those experiments are to be continued. Experiments to furnish the young herring, about 2 months of age, with freshly caught plankton were negative. The herring did not take the copepods or Daphnia, and the plankton introduced seemed to kill the Artemia. We are now using fine chopped Mytilus edulis - even for the herring. The volume must be augmented - larger aquaria, more water, and larger filters. Experiments to rear cod and plaice in our large rearing boxes for lobster using but slightly filtered water were entirely negative. The results were the same when transferring several species of flatfishes after they had passed the stage of transformation. At present we have a good sample of herring 6 months of age, plaice ½ & 1 ½ year, and soles 5 years of age - all brought up from eggs in the laboratory. The last season we had some mortality of the young when 2 - 3 months of age. The symptoms in the plaice indicated an attack of Vibrio anguillarum. In the herring the symptoms indicated Lentospora cerebralis. The cod died before we were aware of the cause of the mortality and could take steps to reduce it. The attack on the plaice was stopped by adding some dissolved salt to the sea-water used. The herring reared in a larger aquarium in the laboratory survived, but in an ordinary aquarium (35 l) they succumbed. The infection this year came probably from our water reservoir. This was partly emptied in early winter, the algae and animals living along the walls died - and {{we were not able to}} have it cleaned out because of high snow and frost. Several experiments indicate that the young cod especially is very sensitive to products of metabolism. In one instance the water was drawn from a container where few cod of 1 - 2 years of age were living. The fry died. But when the older fish were removed, and the container cleaned a new batch thrived. It is impossible to say wether the mortality in the first experiment is to be ascribed to the chemical effect of the products of metabolism or to bacteria. Our experiences from last season give a warning that bacteria and products of metabolism may be a problem of higher order. Our earlier investigations in the inner Oslo-fjord, highly contaminated by sewage, have shown that the survival of the eggs and larvae of the spring spawners here is very poor. And in some places, where contaminated water occurs, even the grown up cod may suffer a great mortality, evidently caused by Vibrio anguillarum. The problem of rearing for experimental purposes has been our main object. Experiments on a large-scale rearing have to be postponed till we have aquired a relatively full knowledge as to the factors of main importance. Besides this work we have made some observations on the behaviour of the eggs. Many of the observations have to be confirmed by special experiments. In order to bring those points under consideration we will, however, mention some of them. The hatching and rearing has ordinarily been undertaken at an ordinary temperature of the sea-water during the season. In some experiments the water has been cooled or heated artificially. As we have no thermostats available for that purposes it has not been possible to keep the temperature quite constant. At a temperature of approximately 2 ° C the cod-eggs hatch normally. herring-eggs will also hatch at that temperature, but the larvae will have difficulties in escaping the eggs, and a heavy mortality occurs. Temperature-variations between 2 ° and 10 ° give high mortality to cod-eggs. In some rearing experiments the mortality among the young may be somewhat higher when the temperature is raising. The question of the relative gas content here comes into the problem. Fungus may be detrimental to the eggs. If they are heavily attacked, the eggs will sink. This occurs especially in foggy weather, and when the water has a relatively low salinity. The attack may be reduced by transferring the eggs for half an hour to sea-water to which has been added some salt. In some cases the cod-eggs have been infected by a flagellate living close inside the shell. Both these pests have been observed in nature - the last mentioned even in the middle of Skagerak. Cod-eggs hatched in circulating - but not renewed - water (constant salinity), gave a poor result. Bacteria may here be involved - or the products of metabolism. The influence of light has been studied more fully. The experiences from the hatching boxes indicate that the hatching of the cod-eggs gives the best results near the window. It is, however, difficult to say anything conclusive of the influence of the light in this case. In the boxes with less light there will also be a higher growth of fungus. Experiments with plaice-eggs indicate that normal daylight near a window - but shadowed for direct sun - gave poor results. And in experiments in the open air the eggs have died. On the other hand the plaice-eggs will hatch well in total darkness. It appears, however, that the plaice-eggs hatched in total darkness will give a higher percentage of larvae with abnormal pigmentation. The dorsal side is quite white, only the fins are pigmentated. When those plaice in the bottom stage, or later, are transferred to our salt-water pond under normal daylight and normal food for several months, no alteration takes place. Experiments also indicate that the plaice-eggs react with light. They may sink in the middle of the day and come to the surface again during the night...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Recommendations about {{risks and}} {{benefits}} of seafood intake during pregnancy have been published in the last decade, but the specific health effects of the different categories of seafood remain unknown. Fish and shellfish may differ according to their fatty acid content and their concentration of chemical pollutants and toxins. Not taking these particularities into account may result in underestimating of both the positive and negative effects of seafood on birth outcomes and partly explains inconsistent results on the subject. Methods In the PELAGIE cohort study, including 2398 pregnant women from Brittany, we fit multiple linear and logistic regression models to examine associations of fish (<b>salt-water</b> <b>fish</b> only) and shellfish intake before pregnancy with length of gestation, birthweight, and risks of preterm births, low birthweight or small-for-gestational-age (SGA) babies. Results When fish and shellfish consumptions were considered simultaneously, we observed a decrease in the risk of SGA birth with increasing frequency of fish intake: OR = 0. 57 (95 %CI: 0. 31 to 1. 05) for women eating fish twice a week or more compared with those eating it less than once a month. The risk of SGA birth was significantly higher among women eating shellfish twice a week or more than among those eating it less than once a month: OR = 2. 14 (95 %CI: 1. 13 to 4. 07). Each additional monthly meal including fish was significantly related to an increase in gestational length of 0. 02 week (95 %CI: 0. 002 to 0. 035). No association was observed with birthweight or preterm birth. Conclusion These results suggest that different categories of seafood may be differently associated with birth outcomes, fish consumption with increased length of gestation and shellfish consumption with decreased fetal growth. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{countries}} such as Norway and the United Kingdom, fish farming of <b>salt-water</b> <b>fish,</b> especially salmon, has gained great economic importance in the past 10 to 15 years. A greater rate of cataract formation has been increasingly reported in salmon in these countries over the past 8 years. The increase in cataract frequency, however, cannot be explained using knowledge about fish lens physiology and morphology gained up until now. In the work presened here, the various stages of glycolysis in the fish lens (based on a determination of the specific activity of 5 enzymes in defined lens sections) were investigated using spectrophotometry. Using this methodology, {{it was possible to}} gain an initial insight into the metabolic physiology of the fish lens and the prerequisites for later investigations of possible cataract noxae could be defined. The metabolism of the lens of the salmon {{is similar to that of}} mammals. But, the enzyme activities measured in the fish lens are clearly lower than those found in the lenses of mammals. The lower enzyme activities may represent the expression of an adaptation to the surrounding water temperature. The relatively high LDH activity and PFK activity demonstrate that glycolysis takes place in the crystalline lens of the salmon. The lower PFK activities in the eyes of farm salmon with cataracts may show blockage of this enzyme due to excessive glucose or decoupling of glycolysis due, for example, to organic phosphates. G 6 P-DH provides an indication of the presence of a pentose phosphate pathway. Increased AR activity indicates a latent type II diabetes. This is present in normal lenses of farmed fish and cataract lenses and is an indication that salmon in fish farms is not able to cope with a constant excessive supply of food. Increased SDH activity with an only short-term WSS existing under stress may indicate a protective function. If a WSS takes up to much carbohydrate, then the SDH could work effectively in order to prevent an excessive accumulation of sorbitol. The salmon in fish farms, in contrast, only show low SDH activity, which is a sign of an inability to cope with the constant over supply of glucose. In contrast to wildsalmon, the salmon used for commercial breeding are on account of unnatural conditions (population density, excessive supply of food, light) under constant stress. The metabolism appears – with an already satisfied requirement – to go out of control. As an argument in favour of this hypothesis, the association of BMI (the ratio between height and weight) with frequency of cataracts in humans is cited. A damaging influence of the regular use of pesticides (organophosphates) on the crystalline lens is probable and will be specifically investigated in future studies. The lens appears to tolerate intra-ocular infections with parasites. This could be demonstrated by the absence of any influence of parasites on lens fresh weight (undisturbed tissue growth) or its transparency. In this study reference is made to testing triploid fish for breeding suitability and (osmotic) stress, pesticides, diet, temperature, UV light, oxidative processes, population density and growth speed lised as possible contributory factors to cataracts. Further monocausal examination where cataracts and their origins are concerned is essential...|$|E
