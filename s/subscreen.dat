500|$|In the action-adventure {{portion of}} the game known as the [...] "Labyrinth", the player explores the surface of Naju in {{humanoid}} form in a top-down perspective. The player must navigate the Labyrinth and find and infiltrate the corridors and ultimately activate Naju's ten safety devices. The Labyrinth consists of screen-wide passages and rooms individually plotted as X–Y coordinates. A map that details these coordinates in a grid-like form can be viewed on the pause <b>subscreen.</b> While the player can generally walk from one screen to the next, some screens are separated by portals called [...] "warp panels". Warp panels bear a symbol indicative of their surrounding area, and the player can only access these warp panels with keys that match these symbols. Some warp panels lead to rooms containing various clues and story elements while others are gateways to shops, password rooms, and corridors. Keys allow players to access different portions of the Labyrinth, which they can then explore in a non-linear fashion.|$|E
50|$|At the 2009 Mobile World Congress, more {{extensive}} changes were revealed. A Calendar tab, featuring month and day views, was introduced. The Stock tab was revised; {{it no longer}} displays graphs, but instead displays the quote and whether it has increased or decreased. The contacts tab was also changed: tapping on a contact displays a <b>subscreen</b> with several new tabs: a contact details tab, and tabs which display text messages, emails, and the call history associated with that contact. The Settings tab has been expanded to include more aspects such as G-sensor and contact card. In addition, a replacement for the Tasks Screen has been devised: all tabs now have an arrangement in landscape format. To give extra screen space, the slider will shrink to a small button on the bottom left, which when pressed will expand to reveal the entire slider. Alternatively, in both portrait and landscape modes, a quick swipe left or right can flip tabs one at a time.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether a debater 2 ̆ 7 s background nonverbal behavior affected audience perceptions {{of her and}} her opponent 2 ̆ 7 s likeability. Students watched one of four versions of a televised debate. In each, while the speaking debater appeared on the main screen, <b>subscreens</b> displayed her opponent 2 ̆ 7 s background nonverbal behavior. In one version, the nonspeaking debater displayed a neutral expression, whereas in the others she displayed occasional disagreement, nearly constant disagreement, or both agreement and disagreement. After viewing the debates, students rated the debaters 2 ̆ 7 likeability. Analysis indicated that background behavior influenced perceptions of the nonverbal communicator but not of the speaking debater...|$|R
40|$|A rhizome has no {{beginning}} or end; {{it is always}} in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo. The tree is a filiation, but the rhizome is alliance, uniquely alliance. The tree imposes the verb “to be, ” but {{the fabric of the}} rhizome is the conjunction, “and [...] . and [...] . and [...] . ”'This conjunction carries enough force to shake and uproot the verb “to be. ” Deleuze and Guattari [11, p. 25] In conjunctive hypertext, activities are combined into a whole as opposed to being alternatives. A single localized construct may contain several actemes. Their relationship may be ambiguous, they may be peers, may have space relationships or time relationships. The conjunction must be actualized, by such devices as co-presentation, delegated presentation, peer traverse, and <b>subscreening.</b> An incomplete conjunction contains pending structure which must be indicated. Actemes may have generalized boolean relationships. Largerscale conjunctivity is related to narration issues, gathering, and other issues related to secondary structure...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} for efficient inspection of {{large volumes of}} imaging data for planetary nebulae (PNe) is demonstrated. Image segmentation to <b>subscreen</b> size is automated. Inspection of consecutive small images mitigates inadvertently missing sections of large images with manual image traversal. Automated interleaving of on-band and off-band images with corresponding difference imaging is carried out. Bi-directional single-click navigation of a segmented, interleaved data set allows blinking of complementary images and efficient identification of PNe candidates. 1 page(s...|$|E
40|$|SummaryWe {{performed}} a genome-wide siRNA screen to identify host factors that regulated pathogen load in human macrophages infected with a virulent strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Iterative rounds of confirmation, followed by validation, identified 275 such molecules {{that were all}} found to functionally associate with each other through a dense network of interactions. This network then yielded to a molecular description of the host cell functional modules that were both engaged and perturbed by the pathogen. Importantly, a <b>subscreen</b> against a panel of field isolates revealed that the molecular composition of the host interface varied with both genotype and the phenotypic properties of the pathogen. An analysis of these differences, however, permitted identification of those host factors that were invariantly involved, regardless of the diversification in adaptive mechanisms employed by the pathogen. Interestingly, these factors were found to predominantly function through the regulation of autophagy...|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Navi Mode" [...] {{present in}} the PlayStation (Complete Works) rereleases of the first six Mega Man games is {{included}} in the Anniversary Collection versions as well. This mode adds helpers that provide game hints if the player is in need of help, revisions the appearance of the health and weapon energy metres and revisions the weapon <b>subscreens</b> for the first three games. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions include some arranged music for the first six games, also originally {{present in the}} Complete Works versions. There are also differences for the extras between each version. The PlayStation 2 version features the original Ruby-Spears Mega Man cartoon pilot episode, while the GameCube version has an interview with Mega Man artist and producer Keiji Inafune. The Xbox version, which was released later, includes the same interview, the first episode of the MegaMan NT Warrior anime, the ability to change the control scheme, and the arranged music tracks from the PlayStation 2 version.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of background nonverbal behavior displayed with the purpose of undermining one 2 ̆ 7 s opponent in televised debates. Students watched one of four versions of a televised debate. In each, while the speaking debater appeared on the main screen, <b>subscreens</b> displayed her nonspeaking opponent 2 ̆ 7 s background nonverbal behavior. In one version, the non-speaking debater remained “stone faced” during her opponent 2 ̆ 7 s speech, while in the other three she nonverbally displayed occasional disagreement, nearly constant disagreement, or both agreement and disagreement. After viewing the debates, students rated the debaters 2 ̆ 7 credibility, appropriateness, objectivity, and debate skills, in addition to judging who won the debate. Analysis indicated that background nonverbal behavior influenced audience perceptions of debaters 2 ̆ 7 credibility, appropriateness, objectivity, debate skill, {{and the extent to which}} the debate was won. These results suggest that adding nonverbal agreement to expressions of nonverbal disagreement do not reduce the negative impacts of communicating disagreement nonverbally during an opponent 2 ̆ 7 s speech and may in fact further decrease the audiences 2 ̆ 7 perception of a debater 2 ̆ 7 s credibility and overall performance...|$|R
40|$|Background: The p 53 tumor {{suppressor}} {{protein is}} mainly regulated by alterations in the half-life of the protein, resulting in {{significant differences in}} p 53 protein levels in cells. The major regulator {{of this process is}} Mdm 2, which ubiquitinates p 53 and targets it for proteasomal degradation. This process can be enhanced or reduced by proteins that associate with p 53 or Mdm 2 and several proteins have been identified with such an activity. Furthermore, additional ubiquitin ligases for p 53 have been identified in recent years. Nevertheless, our understanding of how p 53 abundance and Mdm 2 activity are regulated remains incomplete. Here we describe a cell culture based overexpression screen to identify evolutionarily conserved regulators of the p 53 /Mdm 2 circuit. The results from this large-scale screening method will contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the regulation of these important proteins. Methods: Expression screening was based on co-transfection of H 1299 cells with pools of cDNA’s from a Medaka library together with p 53, Mdm 2 and, as internal control, Ror 2. After cell lysis, SDS-PAGE/WB analysis was used to detect alterations in these proteins. Results: More than one hundred hits that altered the abundance of either p 53, Mdm 2, or both were identified in the primary screen. <b>Subscreening</b> of the library pools that were identified in the primary screen identified several potential novel regulators of p 53 and/or Mdm 2. We also tested whether the human orthologues of the Medaka genes regulate p 53 and/or Mdm 2 abundance. All human orthologues regulated p 53 and/or Mdm 2 abundance in the same manner as the proteins from Medaka, which underscores the suitability of this screening methodology for the identification of new modifiers of p 53 and Mdm 2. Conclusions: Despite enormous efforts in the last two decades, many unknown regulators for p 53 and Mdm 2 abundance are predicted to exist. This cross-species approach to identify evolutionarily conserved regulators demonstrates that our Medaka unigene cDNA library represents a powerful tool to screen for these novel regulators of the p 53 /Mdm 2 pathway...|$|R
