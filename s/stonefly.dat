5|$|Aquatic {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} recognized {{as an integral part}} of the river otter's diet. Otters consume more aquatic insects in the summer as the populations increase and specific life stages heighten their susceptibility. Most aquatic invertebrates preyed upon by the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (<b>stonefly</b> nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles). Invertebrates discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being consumed by the fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the otters.|$|E
5|$|Caddisfly {{cases are}} open at both ends, the larvae drawing oxygenated water through the {{posterior}} end, over their gills, and pumping {{it out of}} the wider, anterior end. The larvae move around inside the tubes and this helps maintain the water current; the lower the oxygen content of the water, the more active the larvae need to be. This mechanism enable caddisfly larvae to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support <b>stonefly</b> and mayfly larvae.|$|E

50|$|The Nemouridae are {{a family}} of <b>stoneflies</b> {{containing}} more than 600 described species, occurring primarily in the Holarctic region. Members of this family {{are commonly known as}} spring <b>stoneflies</b> or brown <b>stoneflies.</b> Fly fishermen often refer to these insects as tiny winter blacks.|$|R
5|$|The nymphs are {{eaten by}} {{a wide range of}} predators and form an {{important}} part of the aquatic food chain. Fish are among the main predators, picking nymphs off the bottom or ingesting them in the water column, and feeding on emerging nymphs and adults on the water surface. Carnivorous <b>stonefly,</b> caddisfly, alderfly and dragonfly larvae feed on bottom-dwelling mayfly nymphs, as do aquatic beetles, leeches, crayfish and amphibians. Besides the direct mortality caused by these predators, the behaviour of their potential prey is also affected, with the nymphs' growth rate being slowed by the need to hide rather than feed. The nymphs are highly susceptible to pollution and can be useful in the biomonitoring of water bodies. Once they have emerged, large numbers are preyed on by birds, bats and by other insects.|$|E
5|$|Various {{insects and}} arachnids reside around the Petitcodiac River. Among them is the <b>stonefly,</b> the mayfly, the caddisfly, the simulium, the {{subfamily}} of tanypodinae, and the Hydracarina. Non-native species, such as the black-footed spider, the beech scale, the white-marked tussock moth, and the mountain ash sawfly have also made their home in the Petitcodiac River watershed. At the southern extremities of the watershed, 50 to 90percent of the world's semipalmated sandpipers feed on the mud shrimp at Shepody Bay. Around 269,445 stop there before migrating to South America, a number which accounts for at least 7.7percent of the total population. Among others, the semipalmated plover (around 2percent of the North American population), the short-billed dowitcher, the red knot, the sanderling, and the least sandpiper are also known for migrating through the Important Bird Area.|$|E

50|$|The Plecoptera are {{an order}} of insects, {{commonly}} known as <b>stoneflies.</b> Some 3,500 species are described worldwide, with new species still being discovered. <b>Stoneflies</b> are found worldwide, except Antarctica. <b>Stoneflies</b> {{are believed to be}} one of the most primitive groups of Neoptera, with close relatives identified from the Carboniferous and Lower Permian geological periods, while true <b>stoneflies</b> are known from fossils only a bit younger. The modern diversity, however, apparently is of Mesozoic origin.|$|R

25|$|Several unusual {{invertebrate}} {{species can}} be found in the Killarney valley. Some of these species, including the northern emerald dragonfly (Somatochlora arctica) and several caddisfly and <b>stonefly</b> species are usually found much further north in Europe. They are thought to be relict species that were left behind in Killarney after the last retreat of ice. The northern or moorland emerald dragonfly, the rarest Irish dragonfly, is confined to the park. It breeds in shallow pools in bogs.|$|E
25|$|In {{broadest}} terms, flies are {{categorized as}} either imitative or attractive. Imitative flies resemble natural food items. Attractive flies trigger instinctive strikes by employing {{a range of}} characteristics that do not necessarily mimic prey items. Flies can be fished floating on the surface (dry flies), partially submerged (emergers), or below the surface (nymphs, streamers, and wet flies). A dry fly is typically thought to represent an insect landing on, falling on (terrestrials), or emerging from, the water's surface as might a grasshopper, dragonfly, mayfly, ant, beetle, <b>stonefly</b> or caddisfly. Other surface flies include poppers and hair bugs that might resemble mice, frogs, etc. Sub-surface flies are designed to resemble {{a wide variety of}} prey including aquatic insect larvae, nymphs and pupae, baitfish, crayfish, leeches, worms, etc. Wet flies, known as streamers, are generally thought to imitate minnows, leeches or scuds.|$|E
25|$|Upon hatching, the gilled larva {{are about}} 10mm long, {{and remain in}} slow-moving pools, or less frequently, hiding in crevices between rocks and {{boulders}} in swift-flowing streams. The larvae do not begin feeding until their yolk sacs are reabsorbed, at which point they begin to feed on benthic invertebrates by prowling {{the bottom of the}} stream. Typical prey items for northern two-lined salamander larvae include chironomid larvae and other dipteran larvae, <b>stonefly</b> larvae, cladocera, and copepods. Predators of the larvae are many, such as fish, crayfish, and other salamander larvae, such as the larger northern spring salamander (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus). The larval period of E. bislineata is variable depending on latitude. In the southern portion of their range, such as New York, metamorphosis occurs at 50mm total length or two years old, while further north, such as in Quebec and likely Ontario, metamorphosis takes place at nearly 70mm total length, or three years old. The larvae over-winter in deeper pools not prone to freezing.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the larvae}} reach their maximum size, {{metamorphosis}} occurs. Sexual maturity is reached in this species at {{three to four}} years old. The adults and juveniles tend to be restricted to the stream edges, hiding under rocks and other debris during the day. Seasonal migration does occur, but not all individuals undertake them. Research done in Quebec suggests a postbreeding migration into the forest occurs in June. These adult salamanders may move over 100 m from the stream. The second migration is that of the newly metamorphosed juveniles leaving the stream, but they tend to remain closer to it. About 75% of individuals dispersing over 100 m into the forest did not return, and they were believed to have been consumed by predators. The majority of above-ground movements are made after dark and in wet weather. The diets of the adults are more wide-ranging than the larvae because of the amount of habitat that can be exploited, both terrestrial and aquatic. The movements of juveniles and adults usually occurs in the first hour after dark, when they emerge from under their retreats and forage along the stream bank or forest floor. Food items recorded include wood roaches, arachnids, worms, isopods, millipedes, beetles, snails, springtails, flies, hymenopterans, sowbugs, mayflies, annelids, <b>stonefly</b> nymphs, and thrips and rarely trout fry. Adult population densities are variable by habitat quality. Adults are also territorial, so if resources are scarce, the population is less dense. In some populations, densities are as low as 0.02-0.04 animals/m2. In other areas, localized densities can be as high as 11 individuals /m2. Adults overwinter up to 80cm deep into the soil of the stream bank in cold climates, but may remain somewhat active in southern regions, and may continue feeding during this period.|$|E
500|$|At {{least five}} {{species have been}} given {{scientific}} names honoring Colbert. In 2008 a species of California trapdoor spider was named Aptostichus stephencolberti. The spider was named for Colbert after he reported on his television series that Jason Bond, a {{professor of biology at}} East Carolina University, had named a different species of spider Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi after the Canadian rock star Neil Young, and began to appeal for a species of animal to be named after him. On a later edition of The Colbert Report, Colbert revealed that Bond would name a spider after him, with Colbert claiming, [...] "And all I had to do was shamelessly beg on national television." [...] Other species named for Colbert include a species of Venezuelan diving beetle named Agaporomorphus colberti and a Chilean <b>stonefly</b> named Diamphipnoa colberti, both formally described in 2008. On his 45th birthday, Colbert was sent a framed print of his eponymous beetle by the biologists who named it. In 2014, a species of parasitic wasp from Ecuador, Aleiodes colberti, was named for Colbert, along with newly described species named for celebrities Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon, Ellen DeGeneres, and Shakira, and in 2016 a rove beetle, Sonoma colberti, was named after Colbert's on-screen persona.|$|E
500|$|The marsh shrew eats invertebrates, {{including}} spiders, earthworms, sowbugs, centipedes, termites {{and other}} terrestrial and aquatic arthropods. It {{was observed in}} captivity pursuing and killing a goldfish, but not eating it. In contrast, the American water shrew has been observed killing and eating fish. A study of the gastric contents of marsh shrews in Oregon indicated that at least 25% of their diet is aquatic, including insect larvae, slugs and snails, mayfly naiads and other, unidentified invertebrates. [...] Other researchers have reported that their diet may also include aquatic insects (water beetles and <b>stonefly</b> nymphs), craneflies, ground beetles, spiders, harvestmen, centipedes, earthworms, slugs and small terrestrial snails. The marsh shrew swims, making short dives in search of food; its mobile snout, whiskers and lips are used to find and capture underwater prey. Before eating, it returns to land. Air trapped in its fur provides buoyancy, and marsh shrews can run {{for as long as}} 3 to 5 seconds {{along the top of the}} water. According to mammalogist Donald Pattie, they can [...] "scull on the surface like whirligig beetles". The air trapped in its fur gives it a silvery sheen. On land, its foreleg and opposite hind leg move at the same time.|$|E
