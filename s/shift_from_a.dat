5|$|In Hubbard's {{efforts to}} <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> psychotherapeutic to a spiritual program, he {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} thetans: a set of godlike, non-corporeal entities capable of creating and shaping universes, later trapped in the MEST and confined, by reincarnation, to physical bodies. Hugh Urban of Ohio State University states that these teachings bear similarities to Gnosticism, although he doubts that Hubbard was well versed in Gnostic thought.|$|E

5|$|David Brooks {{argued that}} a more {{fundamental}} <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> materialist to a post-materialist mindset has occurred in recent generations. While for generations born early in the century increased income {{was the same as}} improvements in lifestyle this is no longer true for people born into an affluent, information driven world. Younger generations live much more intellectually diverse lives and cites much user generated content as being mostly produced outside of the monetary economy. He affirms Cowen's acknowledgment that this has brought large increases in human happiness with correspondingly little economic activity.|$|E
5|$|Many of Vargas Llosa's {{works are}} {{influenced}} by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, however, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise {{from other parts of the}} world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world. Another change over the course of his career has been a <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> style and approach associated with literary modernism, to a sometimes playful postmodernism.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} venom {{is thought to}} have {{provided}} the catalyst for the rapid diversification of snakes in the Cenozoic period, particularly to the Colubridae and their colonization of the Americas. Scholars suggest that the reason for this huge expansion was the <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mechanical to a biochemical method of subduing prey. Snake venoms attack biological pathways and processes that are also targeted by venoms of other taxa; for instance, calcium channel blockers have been found in snakes, spiders, and cone snails, thus suggesting that venom exhibits convergent evolution.|$|E

5|$|Social {{life during}} the Song was vibrant. Citizens {{gathered}} to view and trade precious artworks, the populace intermingled at public festivals and private clubs, and cities had lively entertainment quarters. The spread {{of literature and}} knowledge was enhanced by {{the rapid expansion of}} woodblock printing and the 11th-century invention of movable-type printing. Technology, science, philosophy, mathematics, and engineering flourished {{over the course of the}} Song. Philosophers such as Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi reinvigorated Confucianism with new commentary, infused with Buddhist ideals, and emphasized a new organization of classic texts that brought out the core doctrine of Neo-Confucianism. Although the institution of the civil service examinations had existed since the Sui dynasty, it became much more prominent in the Song period. The officials who gained power by succeeding in the exams became a leading factor in the <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> military-aristocratic elite to a bureaucratic elite.|$|E

25|$|Greenwood and Seshadri (2002) {{show that}} from 1800 to 1940 {{there was a}} {{demographic}} <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mostly rural US population with high fertility, {{with an average of}} seven children born per white woman, to a minority (43%) rural population with low fertility, with an average of two births per white woman. This shift resulted from technological progress. A sixfold increase in real wages made children more expensive in terms of forgone opportunities to work and increases in agricultural productivity reduced rural demand for labor, a substantial portion of which traditionally had been performed by children in farm families.|$|E
25|$|Tom Laliberty of Raytheon {{said that}} President Barack Obama {{was forced to}} <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> land based missile defense system to a sea based one because of the {{difficulties}} of coordinating with partner nations. There is discussion {{about the effectiveness of}} this plan. Some critics say it is not as effective as a ground-based defense since the most advanced Standard missiles lack even half the range to hit ICBMs and even IRBMs arcing overhead. Also, the U.S. Defense Department has said it would be just one component of a wider defense which might also include ground-based facilities. There are some reports that SPY-1 radar systems onboard some individual warships are not being maintained properly.|$|E
25|$|At present, it {{is still}} {{believed}} that molecular oxygen {{was not a significant}} fraction of Earth's atmosphere until after photosynthetic life forms evolved and began to produce it in large quantities as a byproduct of their metabolism. This radical <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> chemically inert to an oxidizing atmosphere caused an ecological crisis, sometimes called the oxygen catastrophe. At first, oxygen would have quickly combined with other elements in Earth's crust, primarily iron, removing it from the atmosphere. After the supply of oxidizable surfaces ran out, oxygen would have begun to accumulate in the atmosphere, and the modern high-oxygen atmosphere would have developed. Evidence for this lies in older rocks that contain massive banded iron formations that were laid down as iron oxides.|$|E

5000|$|Simon Nelson Patten (May 1, 1852 - July 24, 1922) was an {{influential}} economist {{and the chair}} of the [...] Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. Patten {{was one of the first}} economists to posit <b>a</b> <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> 'economics of scarcity' to an 'economics of abundance'; that is, he believed that soon there would be enough wealth to satisfy people's basic needs and that the economy would <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> emphasis on production to consumption.|$|R
25|$|In the May 1994 election, the Socialists won a {{plurality}} of votes and 54% of the seats (with the new Prime Minister, Gyula Horn) after a campaign focused largely on economic issues and the substantial decline in living standards since 1990. This signaled a wish to {{turn back to the}} relative security and stability of the socialist era, but voters rejected both right and left-wing extremist solutions – no such party gained seats in parliament. After its disappointing result in the election, leadership of the Fidesz party opted for an ideological <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> liberal to a conservative party. This caused a severe split in the membership and many members left for the other liberal party, the SZDSZ, which formed a coalition with the socialists, leading to a more than two-thirds majority.|$|E
25|$|Several factors mobilized the <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{representational}} {{art form}} to one increasingly abstract; a {{most important factor}} would {{be found in the}} works of Paul Cézanne, and his interpretation of nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, and the cone. In addition to his tendency to simplify geometric structure, Cézanne was concerned with rendering the effect of volume and space. Cézanne's departure from classicism, however, would be best summarized in the complex treatment of surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes, seemingly arbitrary contours, contrasts and values combined to produce a planar faceting effect. In his later works, Cézanne achieves a greater freedom, with larger, bolder, more arbitrary faceting, with dynamic and increasingly abstract results. As the colors planes acquire greater formal independence, defined objects and structures begin to lose their identity.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year's {{race was}} the last Giro to be run with a points system. The race saw the first appearance of Costante Girardengo, who won the sixth stage, and would come to dominate the Giro in the future. Carlo Oriani— who had just gotten out of serving the Italian military in the Italo-Turkish War— won the event by six points over the second-place finisher, Eberardo Pavesi. The 1914 Giro d'Italia saw the calculation of the general classification <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> points system to a time based system. In the new system, every rider's finishing time for each stage is totaled together and the rider with the lowest total time is the overall leader. Out of the eighty-one riders entered the race only eight of them finished. The grueling race was won by Alfonso Calzolari, who won by almost two hours over the second-place finisher. A Giro was planned for 1915, but the plans were scrapped when Italy entered World War I.|$|E

25|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) are of stromal origin and may {{differentiate}} into {{a variety of}} tissues. MSCs have been isolated from placenta, adipose tissue, lung, bone marrow and blood, Wharton's jelly from the umbilical cord, and teeth (perivascular niche of dental pulp and periodontal ligament). MSCs are attractive for clinical therapy due to their ability to differentiate, provide trophic support, and modulate innate immune response. These cells have the ability to differentiate into various cell types such as osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipocytes, neuroectodermal cells, and hepatocytes. Bioactive mediators that favor local cell growth are also secreted by MSCs. Anti-inflammatory effects on the local microenvironment, which promote tissue healing, are also observed. The inflammatory response can be modulated by adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRC) including mesenchymal stem cells and regulatory T-lymphocytes. The mesenchymal stem cells thus alter the outcome of the immune response by changing the cytokine secretion of dendritic and T-cell subsets. This results in a <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pro-inflammatory environment to an anti-inflammatory or tolerant cell environment.|$|E
25|$|Amerson again {{became a}} free agent after the 2000 season. Rather than pursue Amerson, the Tiger-Cats elected to sign fullback Duane Forde. The signing {{represented}} a <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> receiving back to a running back who primarily blocks. In May 2001, Amerson signed a two-year contract with the Toronto Argonauts. The Argonauts expected to use Amerson as a running back, slotback, and return specialist. Head coach Mike Clemons stated that he expected Amerson to break records with the Argonauts, but Amerson's time with the team was short. In {{the first game of the}} season, he suffered an ankle injury that forced him to miss several games. During this time, receiver and return specialist Greg Hill became increasingly involved in the offense and began to fill the multi-purpose role originally expected of Amerson. The Argonauts dropped Amerson from the active roster and offered him a position on the practice squad in late July. In late August, the Tiger-Cats re-signed Amerson. Clemons later told the media he had been discussing the possibility of re-signing Amerson with other members of the coaching staff when the Tiger-Cats acquired Amerson.|$|E
25|$|UCC faced a major crisis when, in 1958, it was {{discovered}} that the main building was, due to poor construction, in danger of collapse. At the time, despite its benefactors, UCC had no endowment. An emergency building fund was started within the year and, with the assistance of Prince Philip, all of the necessary $3,200,000 was raised from Old Boys and friends of the college; Ted Rogers' contribution paid for the clock tower while Robert Laidlaw donated the funds necessary for construction of Laidlaw Hall. Construction of the present main building began in early 1959 and it was opened by former governor general Vincent Massey near the end of 1960. The crisis forced the school government to rethink their stance on foresight and planning, leading to a years-long program of new construction, salary improvements, and funding sources. Further, in teamwork with Principal Sowby, whom he had helped select, Massey had further influence on the college, bringing about somewhat of a renaissance for the school: A number of distinguished visitors were brought in and leading minds were hired as masters. At this time, the curriculum began to <b>shift</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> classical education into a liberal arts one; language options besides Latin were first offered after 1950.|$|E
