Akamatsu (Japanese red pine,Pinus densiflora D. Don) and shioji (Japanese ash,Fraxinus spaethiana Lingelsh.) were used for the <b>tests.</b> Asymmetric four-point <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> were undertaken by varying the depth/span ratios; and Young's modulus and the shear modulus were calculated by Timoshenko's bending theory. Independent of the asymmetric <b>bending</b> <b>tests,</b> we also conducted three-point <b>bending</b> <b>tests,</b> free-freeflexural vibration tests, and numerical calculations by the finite element method. Young's and shear moduli obtained by these methods were compared with those derived from the asymmetric <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> Based on these comparisons, we concluded that the shear modulus can be properly obtained by the asymmetric four-point <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> when the span is 20 times larger than the depth.|$|R
30|$|We {{measured}} Young's modulus, {{proportional limit}} stress, and bending strength by the compression <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> {{and examined the}} applicability of the testing method by comparing it with conventional <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> methods. Long columns of todomatsu (Japanese fir,Abies sachalinensis Fr. Schmidt) with various length/thickness ratios were the specimens. A compressive load was axially applied to the specimen supported with pin ends. Young's modulus, the proportional limit stress, and the bending strength were obtained from the load-loading point displacement and load-strains at the outer surfaces until the occurrence of bending failure. Four-point <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> were also conducted, and the bending properties obtained were compared with the corresponding properties obtained by the compression <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> Based on the experimental results, we believe that when the stress-strain relation is measured by the load-loading point displacement relation using specimens whose length/thickness ratio is large enough, the bending properties can be obtained properly using the compression <b>bending</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R

40|$|Rotating <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> have been, up to now, {{typically}} {{used for the}} determination of S/N curves. In this paper, a method is proposed that allows {{the determination of the}} fatigue limit curve and the crack growth curve by means of such rotating <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> For this purpose, flaws of controlled shape and size are introduced on the surface of conventional round bar specimens. The rotating <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> rig is equipped with additional hardware for optical crack length measurement. The stress at incipient crack growth gives a point in the fatigue limit (Kitagawa-Takahashi) diagram. After the crack starts to grow, photomicrographs are taken in regular intervals in order to obtain the crack growth curve. – The fatigue limit and crack growth curves obtained from the rotating <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> are compared with results from conventional single edge notch bending specimens. Agreement is good, with the results from the rotating bending experiments lying somewhat on the conservative side. Some factors which may contribute to these differences are the different type of loading and the simplified calculation of the stress intensity factor in the rotating <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> ...|$|R
