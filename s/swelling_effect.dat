40|$|Hydrogen {{solid-state}} {{storage in}} metal hydrides has attracted remarkable attention {{within the past}} decades due to their high volumetric storage densities at low operating pressures. In particular, recently emerged hydride-graphite composites (HGC) can enable a safe, reliable and very compact hydrogen storage solution for various applications. In this regard, only {{little is known about}} the activation behavior of such HGC, their cycle stability and degradation effects. Because of the high sensitivity to hydrogen, neutron imaging offers a distinctive approach to examine in operando reaction fronts, <b>swelling</b> <b>effects</b> and microstructural changes of hydrogen absorbing materials with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this contribution, a comprehensive analysis of various phenomena during activation and cycling of HGC based on a Ti–Mn hydrogen absorbing alloy and expanded natural graphite is reported for the first time. A neutron radiography and tomography set-up with a spatial resolution down to 7 µm was utilized allowing highest detection precision. During initial hydrogenation, regions with enhanced reactivity are observed which contradicts a theoretically expected homogeneous reactivity inside the HGC. These active regions grow with the number of hydrogenation-dehydrogenation cycles until the whole HGC volume uniformly participates in the hydrogen sorption reaction. With regard to long-term hydrogenation-dehydrogenation cycling, inhomogeneous <b>swelling</b> <b>effects</b> were observed from which essential conclusions for technical HGC-based tank systems can be derived...|$|R

40|$|AbstractArticular {{cartilage}} is one {{of several}} biological tissues in which <b>swelling</b> <b>effects</b> are important in tissue mechanics and function, and may serve as an indicator of degenerative joint disease. This work presents a new approach to quantify <b>swelling</b> <b>effects</b> in articular cartilage, as well as to determine the material properties of cartilage from a simple free-swelling test. Samples of nondegenerate and degenerate human patellar cartilage were subjected to osmotic loading by equilibrating the tissue in solutions of varying osmolarity. The resulting swelling-induced strains were measured using a noncontacting optical method. A theoretical formulation of articular cartilage in a free-swelling configuration was developed based on an inhomogeneous, triphasic mechano-chemical model. Optimization of the model predictions to the experimental data was performed to determine two parameters descriptive of material stiffness at the surface and deeper cartilage layers, and a third parameter descriptive of thickness of the cartilage surface layer. These parameters were used to determine the thickness-averaged uniaxial modulus of cartilage, HA. The obtained values for HA were similar to those for the tensile modulus of human cartilage reported in the literature. Degeneration resulted in an increase in thickness of the region of “apparent cartilage softening,” and a decrease in the value for uniaxial modulus at this layer. These findings provide important evidence that collagen matrix disruption starts at the articular surface and progresses into the deeper layers with continued degeneration. These results suggest that the method provides a means to quantify the severity and depth of degenerative changes in articular cartilage. This method may also be used to determine material properties of cartilage in small joints in which conventional testing methods are difficult to apply...|$|R

40|$|Sorption {{processes}} {{can be used}} {{to study}} different characteristics of coal properties, such as gas content (coalbed methane potential of a deposit), gas diffusion, porosity, internal surface area, etc. Coal microstructure (porosity system) is relevant for gas flow behaviour in coal and, consequently, directly influences gas recovery from the coalbed. This paper addresses the determination of coal porosity (namely micro- and macroporosity) in relation to the molecular size of different gases. Experiments entailed a sorption process, which includes the direct method of determining the ‘‘void volume’’ of samples using different gases (helium, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane). Because gas behaviour depends on pressure and temperature conditions, it is critical, in each case, to know the gas characteristics, especially the compressibility factor. The experimental conditions of the sorption process were as follows: temperature in the bath 35 ºC; sample with moisture equal to or greater than the moisture-holding capacity (MHC), particle size of sample less than 212 mm, and mass ca. 100 g. The present investigation was designed to confirm that when performing measurements of the coal void volume with helium and nitrogen, there are only small and insignificant changes in the volume determinations. Inducing great shrinkage and <b>swelling</b> <b>effects</b> in the coal molecular structure, carbon dioxide leads to ‘‘abnormal’’ negative values in coal void volume calculations, since the rate of sorbed and free gas is very high. In fact, when in contact with the coal structure, carbon dioxide is so strongly retained that the sorbed gas volume is much higher than the free gas volume. However, shrinkage and <b>swelling</b> <b>effects</b> in coal structure induced by carbon dioxide are fully reversible. Methane also induces shrinkage and swelling when in contact with coal molecular structure, but these effects, although smaller than those induced by carbon dioxide, are irreversible and increase the coal volume...|$|R

Different kinds of organelles have various metabolic pathways and contain enzymes {{to fulfill its}} function. Commonly used organelles include lysosome, chloroplast and mitochondria. The spatial-temporal distribution pattern of calcium is closed related to ubiquitous signaling pathway. Mitochondria actively participate in the metabolism of calcium ions to control the function and also modulate the calcium related signaling pathways. Experiments have proved that mitochondria {{have the ability to}} respond to high calcium concentration generated in the proximity by opening the calcium channel. In this way, mitochondria can be used to detect the calcium concentration in medium and the detection is very sensitive due to high spatial resolution. Another application of mitochondria is used for detection of water pollution. Detergent compounds' toxicity will damage the cell and subcellular structure including mitochondria. The detergents will cause a <b>swelling</b> <b>effect</b> which could be measured by an absorbance change. Experiment data shows the change rate is proportional to the detergent concentration, providing a high standard for detection accuracy.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the use of nanofiltration membranes as a separation tool inorganic solvents. The thesis starts from the material selection for membrane manufacturing. Nanoporouspolyphenylsulfone flat sheet and hollow fiber membranes were successfully prepared usingthe phase inversion method. The performance of polymeric membranes was studied in terms of the solvent flux and thesolute rejection. Several kinds of interactions are introduced when organic solvents are usedwith polymeric membranes and thus quantification of polymer-solvent interactions is critical. Pure solvent permeation studies were conducted to understand the mechanism of solventtransport through polymeric membranes. Different membrane materials (hydrophilic andhydrophobic) as well as different solvents (polar and non-polar) were used for the study. Polymeric membranes are prone to <b>swelling</b> <b>effects,</b> which leads to a reorganisation of themembrane structure, resulting in a new pore size distribution and a change of the degree ofhydrophilicity of the membrane surface. Hydrophobic membranes show a better solventresistance than hydrophilic membranes. The solvent flux appears to depend on three parameters: transport of momentum, sterichindrance effects and the affinity between the solvent and the membrane material. Newmodels for solvent transport were developed, which can be applied on experimental data ofboth hydrophilic and hydrophobic membranes, and for a broad range of organic solvents andsolvent mixtures. Solute transport in solvent resistant nanofiltration mainly occurs by convection. As ceramicmembranes show similar results as polymeric membranes, differences in membraneperformance cannot be attributed to <b>swelling</b> <b>effects.</b> Transport of dissolved components isalso found to be determined by three parameters: the nominal pore size, the degree ofsolvation of the solute, and the degree of pore wall solvation. A new methodology,incorporating a solvent effect for both the solute and the pore size is presented. Modelparameters, characteristic for specific membrane-solvent combinations, are determined andprovide excellent results for predictive modelling. A case-study on solvent recovery from an oleochemical industry and a pharmaceuticalproduction process via process simulation indicates that solvent resistant nanofiltration is atechnically feasible alternative for traditional separation processes. A membrane unit iscalculated to consume much less energy than a flash. Economic feasibility must however befurther investigated. status: publishe...|$|R
