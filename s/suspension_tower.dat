2500|$|The Skyline GT-R Nismo, {{identified}} by the model code suffix [...] "RA", was introduced on 22 February 1990 and attracted a premium of [...] over the standard car. It existed to homologate a number of changes related to performance, aerodynamics, weight-saving and reliability for Group A racing. Those rules required a production run of 500 units, under the [...] "Evolution" [...] special regulations, but an additional 60 were produced and held by Nissan to turn into race cars, giving a total production of 560 units. Aerodynamic changes include: two additional ducts in the front bumper and removal of the protective honeycomb mesh to improve airflow to the intercooler, a bonnet lip spoiler to direct more air into the engine bay, deeper rear spats, and an additional boot lip spoiler to provide more downforce. The Nismo specification deletes ABS, which are not legal in Group A, and the rear wiper to save weight. The bonnet and front bumpers are aluminium rather than the standard steel, again to save weight. Overall the GT-R Nismo weighs 1400kg compared to 1430kg for the standard GT-R. Tyres are Bridgestone RE71 in 225/55R16 fitted to 16" [...] alloys. Mechanically the GT-R Nismo uses the RB26 engine of the 'standard' GT-R but replaces the stock Garrett T03 turbos with larger T04B models, sacrificing the faster spin up of ceramic turbo wheels for the enhanced reliability of steel wheels. The GT-R Nismo was only available in colour code KH2 [...] "Gun Grey Metallic". Other minor, but noticeable, changes include a circular [...] "Nismo" [...] logo on the right-rear of the boot lip, lack of radio tuning controls on the dashboard console (since a radio was optional), and cross-drilled brake rotors. Nismo-branded options available included a 260km/h speedo, 3" [...] cat-back exhaust system, front <b>suspension</b> <b>tower</b> brace, sports shock absorbers, 17" [...] alloy wheels, and a rear spoiler with built-in tail light.|$|E

50|$|The bridge {{had a clear}} water-way of 688 ft. Its <b>suspension</b> <b>towers</b> were 48 ft {{above the}} level of the roadway, where they were 22 ft thick. The roadway was {{slightly}} curved upwards, 16 ft above high water, and the extreme length {{from the back of the}} piers on shore was 822 ft, supporting 688 ft of roadway. There were eight chains, composed of wrought-iron bars, each five inches deep and one thick. Four of these had six bars in each chain; and four had only three, making thirty-six bars, which form a dip in the centre of about 29 ft. From these, vertical rods were suspended, which supported the roadway, formed of strong timbers covered with granite. The width of the carriageway was 20 ft, with two footways of 5 ft. The chains passed over the <b>suspension</b> <b>towers,</b> and were secured to the piers on each shore. The <b>suspension</b> <b>towers</b> were of stone, and designed as archways of the Tuscan order. The approaches were provided with octagonal lodges, or toll-houses, with appropriate lamps and parapet walls, terminating with stone pillars, surmounted with ornamental caps. Construction of the bridge cost some £80,000. It was operated as a toll bridge.|$|R

50|$|In 2008 November, Mazda {{engineers}} {{improved the}} RX-8 body rigidity through {{the addition of}} structural reinforcements, by adding a trapezoidal shock tower brace and enhancing the local rigidity of the front <b>suspension</b> <b>tower</b> areas. The rear suspension geometry was revised for better handling, and the final-drive-gear ratio on manual transmission cars was shortened from 4.444 to 4.777 for improved off-the-line performance. While minimal, these changes gave the updated RX-8 increased acceleration and performance. Mazda engineers claimed that the 2nd generation RX-8 was (slightly) faster than the previous generation due to the lower gearing and improved suspension. The Renesis II motor iteration that launched with the 2009 model year included a third oil injection port in each rotor housing to feed oil {{to the middle of}} the rotor facing, making this their first all new EMOP (Electric Metering Oil Pump) with a total of 6 lubrication injectors, plus an all new engine oil pump.|$|E
50|$|This bridge {{opened in}} 1979 and {{eliminated}} {{a considerable amount}} of transit traffic south of Düsseldorf and the South Bridge (B 1), both then the only southern access from the left bank of the Rhine to Düsseldorf. Also, it connected the A 46 with the A 57. The Flehe Bridge has in each direction three vehicle lanes and a hard shoulder. The bridge does not cross the Rhine in a right angle, in order to preserve the area of water procurement of the old water company Flehe. A remarkable feature of the Flehe bridge is the reinforced concrete <b>suspension</b> <b>tower,</b> which looks like a Ypsilon turned on its head. In the handles of the pylons an elevator and stairs are accommodated above the roadway. The handles are in bridge longitudinal direction only 6.4 m broad. They were manufactured with a climbing formwork.

The remaining four fields within the range of the bridge removing possess against it a five-cellular box cross-section with base plate width of 29.5 m. A structural steelwork has the 368 m river opening stretching far as if cover.|$|E
5000|$|Paige {{enters the}} {{series with the}} ability to orb, a teleporting ability unique to Whitelighters that allows them to travel {{anywhere}} in the world as well as between various supernatural worlds, including the magically guarded realm of The Elders (often called [...] "Up There" [...] in the show). In the season four episode [...] "A Paige from the Past", it is revealed that Paige has always had access to her power to orb, as the ability saves her from dying in the car crash that killed her adoptive parents. When we are introduced to Paige, her orbing power can only be channeled in panic induced situations as a fear response. She is also only able to orb in and out within the same place, which makes her unable to travel across distances with the power. In the season four episode [...] "The Three Faces of Phoebe", Paige displays growth with her orbing powers by transporting herself across town for the first time. In the same episode, she also displays the advanced ability of orbing with passengers. Despite taking on the full duties of a Whitelighter by the eighth and final season of the series, Paige never shows the ability to orb [...] "Up There". Instead, whenever she congregates with an Elder, she orbs {{to the top of the}} <b>suspension</b> <b>tower</b> of the Golden Gate Bridge to hold a meeting (though since she has successfully orbed to the Underworld on several occasions, this may have more to do with her personal attitude towards them than a lack of ability).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Static {{and dynamic}} effects on power {{transmission}} towers can be evaluated by methodologies available in codes, which suggest {{the use of}} linear static analysis. By using numerical simulations, {{it is possible to}} observe the strong influence of the geometric nonlinear behavior of transmission cables. Dynamic effects also strongly influence this behavior, with the possibility of resonance between the cables and the structure, but up to the moment, the existent analysis procedures have not been completely validated on an experimental basis. In order to validate a complete analysis methodology, experimental procedures are proposed for a <b>suspension</b> <b>tower</b> of a 138 kV transmission line in use. A tridimensional anemometer was installed on this structure in order to measure the values and directions of wind speeds. Simultaneous strain values were collected on the main elements of the tower through optical extensometers. Optical sensor technology with Fiber Bragg Gratings was used, due to the characteristic of immunity to the electromagnetic field occasioned by high electric currents. The string swing angle was evaluated through a high-resolution camera and a tridimensional accelerometer. With this instrumentation, it is possible to create a complete database that correlates wind speeds with the responses of the structural set. At the moment, 5 months of data have been collected and the instrumentation is in the final testing phase and synchronized. After this step, real-time measurements will be performed...|$|E
