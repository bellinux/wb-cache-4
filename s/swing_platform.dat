50|$|Unlike {{ordinary}} playground swings, a Russian swing has steel bars {{instead of}} ropes, and its swinging platform {{is able to}} rotate 360 degrees around the horizontal bar from which it is suspended. Two or more acrobats stand on the <b>swing</b> <b>platform,</b> pumping {{it back and forth}} until it is swinging in high arcs. This motion increases the centrifugal force of the flyer (the acrobat who is going to jump). The flyer then lets go of the swing at the peak of its arc, gaining enough altitude to execute one of various aerial flips before landing at a distance from the swing. The flyer may land on a crash mat, in a vertically slanted net, in the arms of other acrobats (referred to as catchers), in a pool of water, or even on the platform of another Russian swing.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} agent-to-human {{presentation}} of the agent knowledge-level in a multi agent environment. The presentation skill is regarded as an agent's role- the presenter role, in charge of uncovering what is occurring. In our approach the design of this role is driven by two main concerns: i) the inter-agent knowledge sharing, and ii) the human user monitoring of the knowledge being shared by the agents. In this paper we address these concerns from the agent’s ontology commitment perspective. We propose a presenter role model (and its subsequent architecture) centered on the domain and role ontologies. The implementation of the presenter role faces two challenges: one is to cope with diverse knowledge-level representations; {{the other is to}} present behavioral knowledge to the human user. In this paper we describe our approach to the implementation challenges and to the materialization of the presenter role model {{in the context of a}} multi-agent game-like experiment. In the experiment, the inter-agent communication uses a standard semantic language (FIPA SL) and the agent-to-user presentation adopts the Java <b>Swing</b> <b>platform</b> independent user-interface components. We adopted JADE (FIPA compliant) framework as the basis of the development process. Ontology specifications were built with Protégé ontology editor. We are currently exploring the presenter role monitoring capability in the RoboCupRescue multi-agent environment for simulations in the domain of emergency scenarios of search and rescue behavior within large-scale disasters...|$|E

50|$|The DK stages play a bit {{differently}} from the main game. In these stages the bottom screen shows a cannon loaded with a Mini-Mario, a belt upon which the cannon moves on, and a button labeled Shoot that the player must tap to fire the Mini-Mario. The top screen shows your remaining hits, which depends on how many Mini-Marios the player led to the door throughout the entire floor, DK's remaining hits, which always starts out at six, DK's location, and objects the player needs to hit with a Mini-Mario in order to damage him. If a Mini-Mario collides with DK's side, that will damage him as well. The {{only way to get}} lose your own health is if your Mini-Mario is hit with an object or if DK breaks it. DK's movement varies with the stage. In some, it is like the shell game in that there are three locations he can appear and you can somewhat guess where based on a pattern. In the others, he is on a <b>swinging</b> <b>platform</b> that will kill a Mini-Mario if the Mini-Mario collides with it. Floor 8's DK Stage involves him moving between vines. Once the player hits DK six times, the stage ends and the score is tallied up with 100 points for each second remaining and 1000 points for each surviving Mini-Mario. The extra three DK stages are modeled after stages in the original Donkey Kong arcade game.|$|R

5000|$|In 2002 Robert Chicken {{patented}} a {{sheet to}} tiller {{system in the}} UK, known as The Steersman. It consists of two <b>swinging</b> <b>platforms</b> fitted on to the cockpit coamings {{either side of the}} boat,. The normal jib sheet winches are moved from their normal position and then re-bolted down on to the top of these platforms.With the sails set, the leeward jib sheet is cleated to the winch in the normal way, and the wind pressure in the jib, transmitted through the jib sheet, <b>swings</b> the <b>platform</b> forward. To balance this movement, a shock cord spring tensioned between the platform and a point at the stern of the boat, keeps the platform in a central neutral position. Once set, any slight changes in wind strength or direction, causes the <b>platform</b> to <b>swing</b> forwards or backwards. A simple linkage then transmits this movement to the helm to keep the boat on course.The pressure in the sails can vary hugely depending on the wind strength and the direction that the boat is travelling relative to the wind. To accommodate this, the spring is arranged in a ‘block-and-tackle’ form with a double block fitted to the stern of the boat, and a single block clipped to the platform. The fixed end, and tail end are also attached to the platform; the fixed end is clipped, and the tail end passes through a jamb cleat for fine adjustment. With this in place, the maximum spring tension is now made up of four lengths of shock cord. For a lower wind pressure in the jib, the fixed end, and the single block can be re-clipped to an attachment point on the base of the platform. This then gives a range of spring strengths from one to four shock cord lengths. For very light wind pressures, a single lighter length of shock cord is used instead.The claimed benefit of this design over a windvane system that it [...] "is far more sensitive because it uses the larger jib area to sense any changes in the wind" [...] is questionable. When the jib is in laminar flow, i.e. optimally trimmed and delivers maximum propulsion, the force at the sheet is biggest and decreases to both sides of course deviation from this optimum. Concluding from that, the ship must be sailed with sub-optimal sail trim in order to have the proper steering correction at the tiller. Its position in the cockpit area however leaves the stern of the boat clear for other purposes such as dinghy davits, stern ladders etc. In 2012, the invention won the Haven Academy Award in the UK. The chairman of the judging committee was Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person to complete a circumnavigation non-stop, single handed.|$|R
50|$|The Umihara Kawase {{games have}} simple controls. The protagonist {{is able to}} run, jump, climb onto ledges, climb ladders and, crucially, throw her fishing line. When thrown, the fishing line will hook onto nearly all {{surfaces}} within the games. When the line is firmly hooked onto a surface or an enemy fish the line is able to take her weight. From here Umihara is able to <b>swing</b> between <b>platforms,</b> lower herself down to other ledges and swing herself up to higher ledges. Due to the flexible nature of her line she can also catapult herself great distances by stretching the line to breaking point.The line {{can also be used}} to stun fish and reel them in, and once reeled in Umihara will store them in her rucksack and score points in doing so.|$|R

25|$|According to Rod Fergusson, {{the game}} was at one point {{intended}} to be a horror game influenced by Band of Brothers, Resident Evil 4 and Kill Switch. A romance subplot was considered for the game but was eventually dropped. In an interview with Cliff Bleszinski, lead developer for Epic Games, he cites three games that were the primary influences in the game's design, including the pacing and over-the-shoulder third-person perspective from Resident Evil 4 and the tactical-cover system from Kill Switch; Bleszinski also cited Bionic Commandos influence on the cover system, equating the actions of moving from cover to cover as similar to the action of <b>swinging</b> from <b>platform</b> to platform in the latter game. These design choices reflect themselves in the gameplay, as Gears of War focuses mainly on squad team-based and cover-dependent tactics with limited weapons rather than brute force. Bleszinski also cited the influence of The Legend of Zelda, including its storytelling and world-building elements, acquiring and mastering of tools, and underground environments. The game's title itself is a homage to Metal Gear, an early formative influence on Bleszinski. The total cost of development was $10 million, according to Epic's Mark Rein, and only 20 to 30 people were involved with the development at any time. The game also includes a content filter, which will turn off the blood and gore, and the usage of profanity. However, these figures do not include the proprietary Unreal Engine 3.|$|R
5|$|Aeron's main {{weapon is}} the Oraclos Chain, an {{artifact}} {{that can be}} used in multiple ways: it can tie up enemies, bind enemies together so they share damage taken when Aeron attacks, and swing them around Aeron to deal damage. The Chain can also be used to rip armor or materials from enemies. The Chain's attack power increases the longer it is pulled when attached to an enemy. In addition to the Oraclos Chain, Aeron has access to multiple subweapons, such as a sword. Puzzles within the Towers include activating levers and switches, manipulating platforms, triggering special mechanisms unique to each Tower environment, and climbing along walls and beams to reach other areas within the Towers. The Chain is essential to these puzzles, being used as a grappling hook and a rope from which Aeron can <b>swing</b> from one <b>platform</b> to another. Elements within the Towers, such as what enemies are active and what items may be found, vary with the time of day Aeron visits them.|$|R

In order to get a more rational constraint mode, the natural frequency under different constraint condition is calculated. Then the external excitation factors, such as the vibration frequency of the electrical machine in a hoister, <b>swing</b> of suspended <b>platform</b> and the friction disk in a hoister are calculated respectively, finding the external excitation factors which would cause a sympathetic vibration, and giving the suggestions for averting the sympathetic vibration, providing some academic reference to improve and perfect the structure design of the TISAE products...|$|R
5000|$|When Ladd descends into an area, {{players are}} taken to a [...] "Weapon Selection" [...] screen, which they must choose one weapon, {{protective}} piece of equipment, special weapon, and communication device to use.

In the platforming mode, Ladd is unable to jump, so players must use his bionic arm to navigate platforms and obstacles. Players can extend his bionic arm overhead, directly in front, and above at a 45-degree angle.

50|$|By 1965, {{the summer}} {{enrollment}} reached 4,380 campers with 120 staff members. “Pioneer Weeks,” or two-week sessions were introduced {{as well as}} the addition of the Tarzan <b>swing,</b> a diving <b>platform,</b> and a zipline in the same summer. During the summer session, a cabin in Tekakwitha burned down due to a candle left burning by a camper. No one was in the cabin at the time and the other two cabins of the unit were saved. The cabin was a complete loss along with almost all of the camper belongings that had been in it. The campers staying there chose to stick {{out the rest of the}} week, with their parents bringing them new clothing and such, and the cabin was later rebuilt. In 1967 Amantacha became the first tree house unit. The trading post building was also constructed the same year allowing it to move out of the small section of the Administration Building it had been previously housed in. In May 1968, Lake Echon was completed giving campers a separate lake for boating and swimming. To connect the units on the east side of the lake to the main area, the Larry Garner Memorial Bridge was constructed spanning a 210-foot stretch. The Covered Bridge was also constructed in 1968 by volunteers from Saint Mary’s Parish. That same year also saw the addition of four new shower houses and a roadway around almost all of Lake Echon, which replaced the dirt roads and trails.|$|R
