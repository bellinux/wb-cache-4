40|$|Background The {{removal of}} well-fixed {{acetabular}} components following THA (total hip arthroplasty) {{is a difficult}} operation and could be accompanied {{by the loss of}} acetabular bone stock. The optimal method for fixation is still under debate. The aim of this pilot study was to compare the tear-out resistance and failure behavior between osseo-integrated and non-integrated screw cups. Furthermore, we examined whether there are differences in the properties mentioned between <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> and cemented polyethylene cups. Hypothesis Tear-out resistance and related mechanical work required for the tear-out of osseo-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> are higher than in non-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets.</b> Patients and methods Ten human coxal bones from six cadavers with osseo-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> (n = 4), non-integrated (implanted post-mortem, n = 3) <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> and cemented polyethylene cups (n = 3) were used for tear-out testing. The parameters axial failure load and mechanical work for tear-out were introduced as measures for determining the stability of acetabular components following THA. Results The osseo-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> yielded slightly higher tear-out resistance (1. 61 ± 0. 26 kN) and related mechanical work compared to the non-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> (1. 23 ± 0. 39 kN, P = 0. 4). The cemented polyethylene cups yielded the lowest tear-out resistance with a failure load of 1. 18 ± 0. 24 kN. Compared to the screw cups implanted while alive, they also differ on a non-significant level (P = 0. 1). Osseous failure patterns differed especially for the <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> compared to the cemented polyethylene cups. Discussion Osseo-integration did not greatly influence the tear-out stability in cementless <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> following axial loading. Furthermore, the strength of the bone-implant-interface of cementless <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> appears to be similar to cemented polyethylene cups. However, given the high failure load, high mechanical load and because of the related bone failure patterns, removal should not be performed by means of tear-out but rather by osteotomes or other curved cutting devices to preserve the acetabular bone stock...|$|R

As mentioned in Early History above, they were first introduced in the late 1800s and in use to the 1960s in situations where wall sockets were scarce and sometimes non-existent in some rooms (bathrooms, cellars, attics, etc.). Also, as in some countries (such as Italy) electricity was supplied on a [...] "split tariff" [...] basis with electricity for lighting being charged at a lower rate than that for other purposes, lampholder plugs enabled the consumers to reduce their electricity costs and were thus in broad use.|$|R

50|$|The {{bulb socket}} {{in the center}} has a larger {{diameter}} (an E39 or E40 mogul base) than a regular E26 or E27 Edison <b>screw</b> light <b>socket,</b> and is typically made of cast porcelain for the higher temperatures. Mogul-base lamps are available for industrial use in larger power ratings (250-1500) and in halogen, mercury vapor, high-pressure sodium and Metal-halide lamp configurations. Compact fluorescent mogul-base bulbs are also available, as are adaptors to allow medium-base bulbs {{to be used in}} mogul sockets.|$|R
50|$|The bayonet {{light bulb}} mount is the {{standard}} fitting in many {{former members of the}} British Empire including the United Kingdom, Australia, India, Ireland, and New Zealand, as well as parts of the Middle East and Africa (although not Canada, which primarily uses Edison <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> along with the United States and Mexico). The standard size is B22d-2, often referred to in the context of lighting as simply BC. Older installations in some other countries, including France and Greece use this base. First developed by St. George Lane Fox-Pitt in the UK and improved upon by the Brush Electric Company from the late 1870s onward, standard bulbs have two pins {{on opposite sides of the}} cap; however, some specialized bulbs have three pins (cap designation B22d-3) to prevent use in domestic light fittings. Examples of three-pin bulbs are found in mercury street lamps and fireglow bulbs in some older models of electric radiative heater. Older railway carriages in the UK also made use of a 3 pin bulb base to discourage theft. Bayonet cap bulbs are also very common worldwide in applications where vibration may loosen screw-mount bulbs, such as automotive lighting and other small , and in many flashlights. In many other countries the Edison screw (E) base is used for lighting.|$|R

50|$|A {{standard}} <b>screw</b> lamp <b>socket</b> {{has only}} two electrical contacts. In {{the center of the}} bottom of a standard socket is the hot contact (contact one in photo), which typically looks like a small metal tongue bent over. The threaded metal shell is itself the neutral contact (contact three in photo). When a standard bulb is screwed into a standard socket, a matching contact {{on the bottom of the}} bulb presses against the metal tongue in the center of the socket, creating the live connection. The metal threads of the bulb base touch the socket shell, which creates the neutral connection, and this is how the electrical circuit is completed.|$|R
50|$|The tragedy {{was blamed}} on the wrong type of bolt being used to affix the work {{platform}} to a concrete pillar. A Coroner's Court inquest before coroner David Thomas heard that the anchor bolts were only half the length required, were designed to hold electric cables, and were <b>screwed</b> into plastic <b>sockets.</b> The platform collapsed after two of the bolts detached. The weight on the platform exceeded four tonnes, or three {{times more than the}} bolts could support.|$|R
5000|$|Hex <b>socket</b> <b>screw</b> {{heads are}} usually made by {{stamping}} {{the head with}} a die, plastically deforming the metal. Other ways to generate the hex socket include linear broaching and rotary broaching. Broaching the heads with a linear broach is essentially the metalworking analog of mortising wood with a mortising machine; a hole is drilled and then the corners are broached out. This operation often leaves little telltale curled chips still attached {{at the bottom of the}} socket. These are negligible for most applications.|$|R
50|$|Canadian P.L. Robertson, {{though he}} was not the first person to patent the idea of socket-head screws, was the first to {{successfully}} commercialize them, starting in 1908. <b>Socket</b> <b>screws</b> rapidly grew in popularity, and are still a favorite of mechanics today for their resistance to wear and tear, compatibility with hex keys, and ability to stop a power tool when set. Though immensely popular, Robertson had trouble marketing his invention to the newly booming auto industry, for he was unwilling to relinquish his patents.|$|R

Briefly, 6 -week-old Wistar rats (27 males, 120 – 150  g) underwent immediate implant placement as follows: the maxillary right first molars were removed and an experimental implant was <b>screwed</b> into the <b>socket</b> under systemic chloral hydrate under systemic anesthesia.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{a simple}} smooth bore muzzle-loading (SBML) mortar {{consisting}} of a 57 in one-piece steel tube barrel, with a [...] "striker stud" [...] inside {{the centre of the}} closed base of the tube.

A special blank rifle cartridge was loaded and fired via a lanyard from a sheltered position if possible due to the risk of bombs falling short. This ignited the propellant charge and launched the bomb.|$|R

5000|$|Extant records suggest (without {{offering}} exhaustive documentation) {{that the}} idea of a hex <b>socket</b> <b>screw</b> drive was probably conceived as early as the 1860s to the 1890s, but that such screws were probably not manufactured until around 1910. Rybczynski (2000) describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s to the 1890s in the US, which are confirmed to include internal-wrenching square and triangle types (that is, square and triangular sockets) (...) , but he explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. P. L. Robertson, of Milton, Ontario, Canada, first commercialised the square socket in 1908, having perfected and patented a manufacturing method (cold-forming, using the right material and the right die design).|$|R

50|$|In restaurants, wine {{is usually}} {{served by the}} litre, 750 mL or 500 mL bottle, but a wine glass is {{measured}} in ounces. Similarly, fast food restaurants (e.g. McDonald's Quarter Pounder) often advertise measurements of food and drink in US customary units, but converted to metric units, because either the containers are made to US standards, or the franchise is US-based and uses a standard size for its products. Thus in Canada a 20 US fluid ounce bottled soft drink is labelled as 591 mL (or occasionally rounded up to 600 mL). Beer in bottles continues to be 12 imperial fluid ounces (labelled as 341 mL), but beer in cans is filled to 12 US fluid ounces (labelled as 355 mL). There is also a larger sized beer bottle which is labelled as containing 1.18 L. Some of these package sizes have been introduced since Canadian metrication began; for example, the traditional Canadian soft drink can was 10 imperial fluid ounces (284 mL), later marketed as 280 mL. Only in the early 1990s did the US-derived 355 mL size displace it. Television sets and computer screens are also measured in inches. Standard and special fasteners like alloys, nuts, bolts, washers, studs, tapping, self drilling <b>screw</b> and <b>socket</b> screware are often quoted in both imperial and metric; products range from 2/56 in diameter up to 4 in.|$|R
5000|$|A {{ball head}} {{utilizes}} a ball joint to allow movement of all axes of rotation {{from a single}} point. Some ball heads also have a separate panoramic rotation axis {{on the base of}} the head. The head has two main parts, the ball, which attaches to the camera and the socket, which attaches to the tripod. The camera is attached to the ball via quick release plate, or a simple UNC 1/4"-20 [...] <b>screw.</b> The <b>socket</b> is where the ball rotates in, and also contains the controls for locking the ball. The socket has a slot on the side, to allow the camera to be rotated to the portrait orientation. Ball heads come in varying styles of complexity. Some have only one control for both ball and pan lock. While others have individual controls for the ball, pan, and also ball friction. Ball heads are used when a free-flow movement of the camera is needed. They are also more stable and can hold heavier loads, than pan-tilt heads. However, ball heads have the disadvantage that only one control is available to allow or prevent movement of all axes of rotation, so if the camera is tilted on one axis, there may be a risk of tilting on the other axes as well. When a movement of one, or two axes or rotation is needed, a pan-tilt head is used.|$|R
50|$|The Fisher Body company, {{which made}} the car bodies for the Ford Motor Company, was one of Robertson's first {{customers}} and used over 700 Robertson screws in its Model T car. Henry Ford, after finding that the screw saved him about 2 hours of work for each car, attempted to get an exclusive licence for the use and manufacture of the Robertson screw in the US. He was turned down by Robertson who felt {{it was not in}} his best interest and shortly after that, Ford found that Henry F. Phillips had invented another kind of <b>socket</b> <b>screw</b> and had no such reservations. Although the Robertson screw is most popular in Canada, it is used extensively in boat building because it tends not to slip and damage material, it can be used with one hand, and {{it is much easier to}} remove/replace after weathering.|$|R
50|$|Forge work {{depended}} on a declining {{supply of coal}} and wood which idled the plant in 1783. In 1794, Christopher Johnston purchased the property and sold the equipment from the slitting mill to George Elliott for his upstream mill in 1807. The property was auctioned on September 16, 1819, renovated by the Carroll and Oliver families and resold in 1822. A large distillery operation was put into operation by John McKim Jr. which ceased by 1833 when the Thomas Viaduct construction began. The mill continued in operation by George T Worthington until a fire in 1856. In 1868, a major flood damaged the four-story mill. The Levering family acquired the site and sold it in 1876 to the Viaduct Manufacturing Company. A street through the site is now named Levering Avenue. From 1906-1910, a 20-by-30-foot room was rented to Marion B. Davis, who manufactured brass <b>screw</b> threads and <b>socket</b> assemblies for automobiles delivered by horse and carriage. The Viaduct Company produced telegraph equipment onsite until it was abandoned in 1914.|$|R
40|$|PEEK-Polyetheretherketone is a modern, high {{strength}} polymer. In 1999 the product with {{the brand name}} PEEK-OPTIMA god the FDA permission for biomaterial application. Since 1999 different applications using PEEK would be tested and successful transferred in the clinic routine as spine cages, <b>screws,</b> joint <b>socket</b> and others. The problem of mismatch of colour for dental application could be solved by development of new PEEK compound containing titanium dioxide. The name of such a product is PEEK Classix. The most interesting application of PEEK based dental devices are healing caps for implantology. Prosthetic applications are not described up to now. Aim of this work was to test possibilities of treatments and combining (gluing) of PEEK with commercial available dental composites. The main interest was focused as well on the test of physical and mechanical properties as the treatment under laboratory conditions to get reliable bondings to composites. Therefore different treatment conditions would be tested to find an optimal protocol for application in the laboratory. The results show that a treatment by blasting with aluminium oxide with different particle size, between 50 and 250 µm, results in a serious improvement of bonding strength to the composite. The application of silanized blasting material drives to an additional improvement of bonding strength which is stable enough under conditions in the mouth at least. The mechanical properties of PEEK, here the bending strength, are high enough for production of dental devices as bridges and crowns for a long term application. This considers the necessity of manufacturing of very tiny, delicate structures, where in case of overloading a break comes up but in case of PEEK only a bending takes place. However the limitation of bending strength {{in case of a}} combination between PEEK frame and a composite cover is limited by the bending strength of the composite material and appear by delaminating of the cover material. Additional investigations are necessary to find a better fit between PEEK and a cover material possibly based on other chemical formulation. Technically are even more variation possible which should be investigated in the future too. The results show a very promising way for an application of a new material which avoids a lot of disadvantages as monomer release, water uptake, release of degradation products and mechanical instability...|$|R
