40|$|We study <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> in {{a channel}} between two {{parallel}} permeable walls induced by oscillating (in time) blowing/suction at the walls. We obtain an asymptotic {{expansion of the}} solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in the limit when the amplitude of the normal displacements of fluid particles near the walls is much smaller that both the width of the channel and the thickness of the Stokes layer.

40|$|Acoustic {{stimulation}} of the cochlea leads to a travelling wave in the cochlear fluids and on the basilar membrane (BM). It has long been suspected that this travelling wave leads to a <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> flow in the cochlea. Theoretical investigations suggested that the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> might be of physiological relevance. Here, we present a quantitative study of the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> in a computational model of a passive cochlea. The structure of the streaming flow is illustrated and the sources of streaming are closely investigated. We describe a source of streaming {{which has not been}} considered in the cochlea by previous authors. This source is also related to a steady axial displacement of the BM which leads to a local stretching of this compliant structure. We present theoretical predictions for the streaming intensity which account for these new phenomena. It is shown that these predictions compare well with our numerical results and that there may be <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> velocities of the order of millimetres per second. Our results indicate that <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> should be more relevant to low-frequency hearing because the strength of the streaming flow rapidly decreases for higher frequencie...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} model {{reciprocal}} swimmer {{composed of two}} unequal spheres that oscillate with respect to each other, and we use computer modeling to study its motility for 0 < Re < 150. We show that our model switches swimming direction from a small-sphere-leading to a large-sphere- leading regime at Re≈ 30. Thus, although the relative oscillation of the spheres is the same in all cases, the two flow regimes yield distinct motility mechanisms. The generated flows are qualitatively similar to pullers and pushers in Stokes flows, except that here inertial forces {{play an important role}} in the system dynamics. We relate both motility mechanisms to the classical nonlinear phenomenon of <b>steady</b> <b>streaming,</b> suggesting that <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> can be an important physical mechanism in swimming at intermediate Re. As a step towards classifying swimming at intermediate Reynolds numbers, we introduce the concepts of <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> pullers and <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> pushers.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a low-viscosity fluid inside a rapidly rotating horizontal cylinder were experimentally studied. In the rotating frame, {{the force of}} gravity induces azimuthal fluid oscillations at a frequency equal to the velocity of the cylinder’s rotation. This flow is responsible for a series of phenomena, such as the onset of centrifugal instability in the Stokes layer and the growth of the relief at the interface between the fluid and the granular medium inside the rotating cylinder. The phase inhomogeneity of the oscillatory fluid flow in the viscous boundary layers near the rigid wall and the free surface generates the azimuthal <b>steady</b> <b>streaming.</b> We studied the relative contribution of the viscous boundary layers in the generation of the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming.</b> It is revealed that the velocity of the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> can be calculated using the velocity of the oscillatory fluid motion...|$|R

5|$|On 25 June 1950 the Korean War {{began when}} the North Korean People's Army invaded the Republic of Korea (ROK) with 90,000 well-trained and {{equipped}} troops who easily overran the smaller and more poorly equipped Republic of Korea Army. In response, the United States (U.S.) and United Nations (UN) began an intervention campaign to prevent South Korea from collapsing. The U.S. troops engaged the North Koreans first at the Battle of Osan where they were badly defeated on 5 July by the better-trained North Koreans. From there, the U.S. and UN suffered a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> of defeats that pushed {{them back to the}} Pusan Perimeter by August.

Casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> during the morning. All available men from Headquarters Company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points. At one time, the regimental reserve was down to six men.

40|$|Microfluidic devices can use <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> {{caused by}} the {{ultrasonic}} oscillation of one or many gas bubbles in a liquid to drive small scale flow. Such streaming flows are difficult to evaluate, as analytic solutions are not available for any but the simplest cases, and direct computational fluid dynamics models are unsatisfactory due to the large difference in flow velocity between the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> and the leading order oscillatory motion. We develop a numerical technique which uses a two-stage multiscale computational fluid dynamics approach to find the streaming flow as a steady problem, and validate this model against experimental results. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{well-developed}} {{method to}} induce mixing on microscopic scales is to exploit flows generated by <b>steady</b> <b>streaming.</b> <b>Steady</b> <b>streaming</b> is a classical fluid dynamics phenomenon whereby a time-periodic forcing in the bulk or along a boundary {{is enhanced by}} inertia to induce a non-zero net flow. Building on classical work for simple geometrical forcing and motivated by the complex shape oscillations of elastic capsules and bubbles, we develop the mathematical framework to quantify the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> of a spherical body with arbitrary axisymmetric time-periodic boundary conditions. We compute the flow asymptotically for small-amplitude oscillations of the boundary in the limit where the viscous penetration length scale is {{much smaller than the}} body. In that case, the flow has a boundary layer structure and the fluid motion is solved by asymptotic matching. Our results, presented in the case of no-slip boundary conditions and extended to include the motion of vibrating free surfaces, recovers classical work as particular cases. We illustrate the flow structure given by our solution and propose one application of our results for small-scale force-generation and synthetic locomotion...|$|R

5|$|By late 1585, {{although}} Ernst's {{brother had}} made significant inroads into the Electorate of Cologne, both sides had reached an impasse.

The Calvinist barons and counts understood the danger of Spanish intervention: it meant the aggressive introduction of the Counter-Reformation in their territories. France, {{in the person of}} Henry III, was equally interested, since the encirclement of his Kingdom by Habsburgs was cause for concern. Another sizable portion of the electorate's populace adhered to the old faith, supported by Wittelsbach-funded Jesuits. The supporters of both sides committed atrocities of their own: in the city of Cologne, the mere rumor of Gebhard's approaching army caused rioters to murder several people suspected of sympathizing with the Protestant cause.|$|E

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the source of an important component of nonlinear loading on a horizontal cylinder beneath waves that is not present in conventional diffraction calculations. Earlier measurements (Chaplin 1984 b) have suggested that circulation induced by <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> around the cylinder may be responsible for loading which in some cases reduces the perceived inertia force by 50 %. The present work is aimed at studying the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> around a cylinder in general non-uniform orbital flow, and determining whether in the particular case of wave-induced flow it could be related quantitatively to the loading. The steady outer flow has been obtained numerically for cases where the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> does not have a reversal, and for cases where a weak reversal is compatible with a uniform outer circulation. It is found that the outer circulation is closely related to the mean streaming velocity around the cylinder at {{the outer edge of the}} shear-wave layer. Results for conditions corresponding to previous measurements of force on a horizontal cylinder beneath waves suggest that separation, turbulence, transient effects and organized three-dimensional instabilities should also be considered. <br/...|$|R

5|$|For Walther, at the bridge, the {{position}} appeared defensible {{for as long}} as it would take to remove Ney's force through Winterthur, yet the shock of the Austrian force, as it hit his defences, was sufficient to break his line after 90 minutes of brisk fighting.

From the ridge, Ney's rear guard maintained a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> of cannon fire on any of the Austrians who crossed the bridge and attempted to advance up the hill. Hotze recognised the futility of throwing his men into direct cannon fire and ordered instead a steady musketry barrage.

40|$|The fish ear {{contains}} three dense, bony bodies (otoliths) {{surrounded by}} fluid (the endolymph) and tissue. Under acoustic stimulation, the surrounding fluid and tissues oscillate {{relative to the}} otoliths, stimulating the endolymph {{as well as the}} array of hair cell cilia adjacent to the otolith and embedded in tissue. It is believed that the hair cell cilia move with the surrounding fluid. This doctoral thesis studied the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> (i. e., time-independent) component of the acoustically induced fluid motion inside of the fish ear to determine how the hair cell cilia displacements due to the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> could provide acoustically relevant information to the fish. This research characterizes the fluid flow around oscillating model otoliths, namely spheroids, grooved spheroids, and a 350 % scale model of a cod saccular otolith. This study models the otolithic endorgan as an oscillating body in a Newtonian fluid. The model ignores the surrounding tissues and assumes that the hair cell cilia move like the surrounding fluid. Particle pathline visualizations and particle-image velocimetry (PIV) are used to characterize the flow fields at various oscillation orientations, frequencies and amplitudes. These data are used to determine the location of the stagnation points on the body surface and at the boundaries of the inner rotating region of the flow. Studies are also conducted on bodies sinusoidally oscillated at both a single frequency and two (simultaneous) frequencies along the same direction. Both the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> flow patterns and velocity fields are found to contain acoustically relevant information, but given the very small displacements associated with these flows, it is unclear if the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> flows can be sensed by the fish ear.

40|$|Certain retinal {{conditions}} are treated by direct drug injection into the vitreous humour; the subsequent delivery {{will be affected}} by vitreous motion driven by saccades of the eyeball. We model the saccades as small-amplitude sinusoidal oscillations, and the vitreous humour as a Newtonian fluid. Treating the vitreous chamber as a sphere, we obtain an oscillating flow plus a correction that includes a <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> flow on vertical planes, and we argue that both components have comparable importance for drug transport. In reality however, the vitreous chamber has an indentation due to the lens. Accounting for this leads to a perturbation in the flow field. The oscillatory component includes a vortex formed behind the lens every half period that migrates into the interior, and the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> has two counter-rotating vortices...|$|R

5|$|In the Filibranchia and Eulamellibranchia, {{water is}} {{drawn into the}} shell from the {{posterior}} ventral surface of the animal, passes upwards through the gills, and doubles back to be expelled just above the intake. In burrowing species, there may be two elongated, retractable siphons reaching up to the seabed, one each for the inhalant and exhalant streams of water. The gills of filter-feeding bivalves are known as ctenidia and have become highly modified to increase their ability to capture food. For example, the cilia on the gills, which originally served to remove unwanted sediment, have become adapted to capture food particles, and transport them in a <b>steady</b> <b>stream</b> of mucus to the mouth. The filaments of the gills are also much longer than those in more primitive bivalves, and are folded over to create a groove through which food can be transported.

40|$|The {{flow in the}} {{boundary}} layer generated close to the sea bottom by the propagation of a monochromatic surface wave is determined by considering small values of both the wave steepness and the ratio between the thickness of {{the boundary}} layer and the local water depth. Nonlinear effects are considered and attention is focussed on the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming.</b> The sea bed is assumed to be horizontal, impermeable and rippled and the small scale bedforms are supposed to act as a large roughness the size of which depends on the ripple height. The analysis of Blondeaux et al. (2012), who considered a flat bed, is thus extended. The geometrical characteristics of the ripples are predicted using empirical formulae and, then, the bedforms are assumed to behave as a bottom roughness, the size of which is related {{to the size of the}} ripples. A comparison of the model results with experimental measurements supports the theoretical findings. As in the sheet flow regime (when the sea bed is flat), the <b>steady</b> <b>streaming</b> at the bottom of sea waves is found to be different from that predicted in an oscillating water tunnel (U-tube).
