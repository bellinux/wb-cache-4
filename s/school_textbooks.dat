5|$|Holmboe's {{significant}} impact on mathematics in the fledgling Norway was his textbook in two volumes for secondary schools. It was widely used, but faced competition from Christopher Hansteen's alternative offering, sparking {{what may have been}} Norway's first debate about <b>school</b> <b>textbooks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s, Dürer's image {{appeared}} in <b>school</b> <b>textbooks</b> in Germany as a faithful {{image of the}} rhinoceros; and it remains a powerful artistic influence. It {{was one of the}} inspirations for Salvador Dalí; a reproduction of the woodcut hung in his childhood home and he used the image in several of his works.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Deng's order to ram the Yoshino and his {{subsequent}} refusal {{to leave his}} ship as it sank has resulted in him being placed in popular culture as a national hero, particularly following {{the formation of the}} People's Republic of China. Deng, and the events on the Zhuyuan are repeated in <b>school</b> <b>textbooks</b> in China, where they praise his actions while also criticising Li Hongzhang. The People's Liberation Army Navy training ship Shichang, was named after Deng.|$|E

5|$|At the university, Holmboe again met Christopher Hansteen, who {{had become}} a {{professor}} there in 1816. In 1835, Hansteen published his own mathematics textbook for secondary schools. A reaction to Holmboe's books and method of teaching, it was more practically oriented. Holmboe wrote {{a review of the}} book for the newspaper Morgenbladet, in which he advised schools not to use it. A public debate followed, with contributions from other mathematicians. It has been claimed that this was the first debate on the subject of <b>school</b> <b>textbooks</b> in Norway. Hansteen's textbook was not reprinted.|$|E
5|$|In the 1928 provincial election, the Liberals regained some {{of their}} lost {{popularity}} {{in one of the}} closest votes in Nova Scotia history. The Conservatives remained in power with 23 seats to the Liberals' 20. Economic conditions worsened after the stock market crash of 1929 making it seem increasingly likely that the Liberals would return to power in the next election. Macdonald helped draft a 15-point party platform for approval at a Liberal convention in the fall of 1930. It promised an eight-hour working day and free elementary <b>school</b> <b>textbooks.</b> It also pledged to establish a formal inquiry into Nova Scotia's economic prospects and the province's place within Confederation.|$|E
5|$|However, the Taiwanese Aboriginal {{peoples who}} were {{previously}} {{allied with the}} Dutch against the Chinese during the Guo Huaiyi Rebellion in 1652 turned against the Dutch during the later Siege of Fort Zeelandia and defected to Koxinga's Chinese forces. The Aboriginals (Formosans) of Sincan defected to Koxinga after he offered them amnesty; the Sincan Aboriginals then proceeded {{to work for the}} Chinese and behead Dutch people in executions while the frontier aboriginals in the mountains and plains also surrendered and defected to the Chinese on 17 May 1661, celebrating their freedom from compulsory education under the Dutch rule by hunting down Dutch people and beheading them and trashing their Christian <b>school</b> <b>textbooks.</b>|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Constitutional Law for the Vilayet of Bosnia was issued, Osman Pasha invited {{publishing}} magnate Ignjat Sopron to Sarajevo. Sopron was {{the owner and}} manager of a publishing and printing house in Zemun (then part of the Austrian Empire, today one of the municipalities of Belgrade, Serbia). An ethnic German, {{he was born in}} 1821 in Novi Sad as Ignaz Karl Soppron. Upon his arrival in Sarajevo, Osman Pasha offered him a subsidy to establish and organise a printing house. It was to be headquartered in a building on Sarajevo's Dugi sokak street that was being rented by the vilayet's government. Sopron soon came to the city bringing with him printing tools and materials, accompanied by a typesetter from Belgrade, Ilija Tomić. Tomić {{was in charge of the}} Cyrillic and Latin letters, and he engaged three graduated students of the Serb secondary school in Sarajevo to be his trainees. Osman Pasha also invited a man named Kadri-effendi from Istanbul to work as the typesetter for Arabic letters. The principal aim of the printing house was to issue an official gazette and to publish elementary <b>school</b> <b>textbooks,</b> thus stopping their import from Serbia and Austria.|$|E
5|$|Takla Sadeq Makuriya (1913–2000), {{historian}} and {{former head of}} the National Archives and Library of Ethiopia, wrote various works in Amharic as well as foreign languages, including a four-volume Amharic-language series on the history of Ethiopia from ancient times until the reign of Selassie, published in the 1950s. During the 1980s he published a three-volume tome exploring the reigns of 19th-century Ethiopian rulers and the theme of national unity. He also produced two English chapters {{on the history of the}} Horn of Africa for UNESCO's General History of Africa and several French-language works on Ethiopia's church history and royal genealogies. Some volumes from his vernacular survey on general Ethiopian history have been edited and circulated as <b>school</b> <b>textbooks</b> in Ethiopian classrooms by the Ministry of Education. Kebede Michael (1916–1998), a playwright, historian, editor, and director of archaeology at the National Library, wrote works of world history, histories of Western civilization, and histories of Ethiopia, which, unlike his previous works, formed the central focus of his 1955 world history written in Amharic.|$|E
5|$|The first {{newspaper}} {{to be published}} in Bosnia and Herzegovina was Bosanski vjestnik, a political-informative and educational weekly edited by Sopron and printed in Serbian Cyrillic. It had a pro-Serb inclination, though it generally promoted a unitary Bosnian nation, in accordance with the Ottoman policy in the province. The official gazette, the weekly Bosna, was primarily concerned with publishing and explaining laws, orders, and proclamations. Another weekly issued by the printing house was Sarajevski cvjetnik, which fiercely defended the Ottoman regime and polemicised with Serbian and Austrian newspapers that criticised it. Bosna and Sarajevski cvjetnik were bilingual, printed half in Ottoman Turkish and half in Serbo-Croatian in the Cyrillic script. The printing house produced a number of elementary <b>school</b> <b>textbooks,</b> including the second Serbian alphabet book using the reformed Serbian Cyrillic, following Vuk Karadžić's book published in Vienna in 1827. Other books include a collection of Bosnian Serb lyric folk poetry, an Ottoman Turkish grammar, and several Jewish religious books. The first printed exemplar of Bosnian Aljamiado literature was also published by the Vilayet Printing House. It produced around 50 books and booklets altogether, most of them being concerned with various Ottoman laws and legislation.|$|E

25|$|Several {{political}} parties {{have been accused of}} using their political power to manipulate educational content in a revisionist manner. Congress governments promoted hegemony of Socialist-Marxist authors ideologically aligned to policies of Nehru Gandhi family. The government was accused of being too sympathetic to the Muslim viewpoint. Muslim invaders were projected as heroes and rich legacy of Indian Civillisation was marginalised. The BJP-led NDA government tried to standardise <b>school</b> <b>textbooks</b> and remove Marxist-Islamist ideological biases.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, only a {{small but}} vocal {{minority}} deny the atrocity outright. Some Japanese journalists and social scientists, such as Tomio Hora and Katsuichi Honda, have played prominent roles in countering revisionist historiography, in the decades since the killings. Nonetheless, denialist accounts, {{such as those of}} Shūdō Higashinakano, have often created controversy in the global media, particularly in China and other East Asian nations. Coverage of the massacre in Japanese <b>school</b> <b>textbooks</b> also troubles Sino-Japanese relations, as in some textbooks, the massacre is usually only briefly mentioned.|$|E
