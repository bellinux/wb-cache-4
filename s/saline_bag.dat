50|$|The {{proceedings}} {{began with}} {{the conclusion of the}} recording of Murray's interview with the police from 48 hours after Jackson's death. Afterwards, Smith continued his testimony. Smith never mentioned in any notes referencing a propofol bottle being inside a <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> during searches of Jackson's home in June 2009. He saw the propofol bottle beside a cut <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> after Fleak had removed them from the Costco bag and it was the only <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> found. Search warrants were executed of Murray's house in Las Vegas, offices in Las Vegas and Houston, his girlfriend's apartment, his warehouse and his car, and no propofol was found. During brief statements taken from Mohammed and Amir at the hospital on June 25, 2009, neither of them mentioned Murray asking to be brought back to the residence. Alvarez did not mention propofol in an IV bag or Murray asking him to put things in bags until after {{the cause of death was}} released on August 27, 2009.|$|E
50|$|During {{chemotherapy}} treatments, {{medical professionals}} access multi-dose bags of saline to flush patient ports. Outbreaks {{occur as a}} result of doctors and nurses reusing syringes, contaminating the <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> with the blood of multiple patients.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the {{stability}} of a patient following an exploratory laparotomy, the abdomen may either be sutured closed primarily or may be temporarily closed with a vacuum dressing, <b>saline</b> <b>bag,</b> or towel clips to facilitate further non-surgical resuscitation prior to definitive closure.|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} height, external pressure, and bladder fullness on the flow rate in continuous, non-continuous cystoscopy and the automated irrigation fluid pumping system (AIFPS). Materials. Each experiment had two 2 -litre 0. 9 % <b>saline</b> <b>bags</b> connected to a continuous, non-continuous cystoscope or AIFPS via irrigation tubing. Other equipment included height-adjustable drip poles, uroflowmetry devices, and model bladders. Methods. In Experiment 1, <b>saline</b> <b>bags</b> were elevated to measure the increment in flow rate. In Experiment 2, <b>saline</b> <b>bags</b> were placed under external pressures to evaluate the effect on flow rate. In Experiment 3, flow rate changes in response to variable bladder fullness were measured. Results. Elevating <b>saline</b> <b>bags</b> caused an increase in flow rates, however the increment slowed down beyond a height of 80 [*]cm. Increase in external pressure on <b>saline</b> <b>bags</b> elevated flow rates, but inconsistently. A fuller bladder led to a decrease in flow rates. In all experiments, the AIFPS posted consistent flow rates. Conclusions. Traditional irrigation systems were susceptible to changes in height of irrigation solution, external pressure application, and bladder fullness thus creating inconsistent flow rates. The AIFPS produced consistent flow rates and was not affected {{by any of the}} factors investigated in the study...|$|R
30|$|The animals {{underwent}} a procedure {{similar to the}} VOL group, but empty <b>saline</b> <b>bags</b> were inserted into the abdominal cavity.|$|R
30|$|Our {{study showed}} that IAH {{generated}} with either of two methods: CO 2 pneumoperitoneum or intra-abdominal placement of <b>saline</b> <b>bags,</b> causes abdominal compartment syndrome and organ dysfunction within 12 h. The animals subjected to CO 2 pneumoperitoneum developed artificial hypercapnia and acidosis.|$|R
50|$|The next {{witness to}} the stand was LAPD Detective Orlando Martinez. Also in the robbery {{homicide}} division, Martinez {{has been with the}} LAPD for ten years. On hearing of Jackson's death, he went to UCLA and was present for half of Alvarez's interview. He stated that Alvarez didn't mention putting away vials for Dr. Murray or seeing a vial or bottle inside an IV bag. It was heard that Mr. Walgren had a meeting with Alvarez and Myres in his office in April 2011. Martinez brought (from the case's evidence) a <b>saline</b> <b>bag,</b> a propofol bottle and a pulse oximeter to the meeting. Alvarez didn't recognize the propofol bottle shown to him. Alvarez was asked to draw the <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> he saw after he described something {{at the bottom of the}} bag, it looked to be a port or some kind of apparatus.|$|E
5000|$|Fleak {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} an IV stand, a saline infusion set, and a depressed syringe in a y-port connected to the tubing beside Jackson's bed. The court heard that she issued a subpoena to Murray for Jackson's medical records, and only the records pre-2009 were submitted to her. During cross-examination, Chernoff asked Fleak about a number of [...] "mistakes" [...] during her examination, such as picking up a bottle from the floor before photographing it, ignoring the presence of the IV stand, not taking a picture of the propofol bottle inside the cut <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> (she said she took it out {{to see what it was}} then photographed it), and destroying her handwritten notes from June 25, 2009. It was heard that Fleak did not mention the propofol bottle was inside the <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> in writing until March 2011. The defense suggested that she changed her story to fall into line with other witness' stories regarding the bottle in the bag.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{bags were}} recovered: a black bag {{containing}} a Starline {{blood pressure cuff}} box and 3 bottles of lidocaine; a blue Costco bag (found in the closet) containing [...] "medical debris" [...] including a pulse oximeter, a lanyard, vials, an empty 20ml propofol bottle, 2 bottles of midazolam, an opened IV administration set, a urinary leg bag, a wideband bag, 2 empty dressing bags, 2 empty catheter bags, opened alcohol prep pads, dressing backings, an empty syringe packet, 4 vial tops and a needle cap. Also the <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> with a cut in it containing the [...] "more or less empty" [...] 100ml propofol bottle that Alvarez recalls removing from the IV stand; and a light blue [...] "baby essentials" [...] bag, containing an array of bottles that included 100ml propofol and 20ml propofol bottles (filled to various levels, some opened, some closed), lorazepam, flumazenil, lidocaine, and Benoquin. Murray's business cards from his Houston practice were also found.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} the amount of change in Standardised Uptake Values (SUVs) of PET/CT images by simulating the set-up {{as closely as possible}} to the actual patient scanning. The experiments were conducted using an anthropomorphic phantom, which contained an amount of radioactivity in the form of Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in a primary plastic test tube and one litre <b>saline</b> <b>bags,</b> including the insertion of bony structures and another two test tubes containing different concentrations of iodine contrast media. Standard scanning protocols were employed for the PET/CT image acquisition. The highest absolute differences in the SUVmax and SUVmean values of the <b>saline</b> <b>bags</b> were found to be about 0. 2 and 0. 4, respectively. The primary test tube showed the largest change of 1. 5 in both SUVs; SUV max and SUVmean. However, none of these changes were found to be statistically significant. The clinical literature also contains no evidence to suggest that the changes of this magnitude would change the final diagnosis. Based on these preliminary data, we propose that iodine contrast media can be used during the CT scan of PET/CT imaging, without significantly affecting the diagnostic quality of this integrated imaging modality...|$|R
30|$|Comparing IAP with IBP in the CO 2 {{group showed}} that IBP was {{constantly}} 1 to 2 mmHg above IAP. In the VOL model, the IBP was {{slightly lower than}} that in the CO 2 group. The reason for this was that the abdominal cavity of our animals could only hold seven <b>saline</b> <b>bags,</b> producing an IBP of 22 mmHg. The lower IBP in the VOL group could result in less impact than if the IBP had been as high as in the CO 2 group.|$|R
30|$|A {{drawback}} of the VOL {{method is}} {{the inability to}} ensure that the intra-abdominally bags are placed in the same position in every experiment. This may result in nonuniform pressure transmission producing a local pelvic compartment syndrome. Combining IBP and intragastric pressure could provide further information on this issue [18]. Another drawback when using <b>saline</b> <b>bags</b> is that the bags' borders are not smooth. They may cause bleeding or inflammation if the sharp parts interfere with surrounding tissues or vessels. We did not perform post-mortem examinations for organ or vessel damage.|$|R
5000|$|White {{was back}} on the stand being {{examined}} by J. Michael Flanagan. It was heard that, based on the diagram showing what Dr. Murray told the police he gave to Jackson on the night in question, it would not have presented any danger at all. White said that [...] "the dose of propofol we are talking here is 25 mg. This is a dose that produces little anxiety, little sleepiness." [...] It was heard that anesthesiologists are obviously trained in sedation. For non-anesthesiologists, most hospitals require certification to use sedation. White was then given a certificate to read. It was Murray's certification from Sunrise Medical Hospital approving him to administer moderate sedation. It qualifies the doctor to administer drugs to achieve moderate sedation; but he must monitor patients carefully. The certification also says the doctor is approved to rescue patients from deep sedation, manage compromised airway, and provide adequate ventilation. Flanagan and White went through simulations that Shafer put together with variables of amount of drugs and time administered. It was heard that {{the fact that there is}} some free lorazepam in the stomach, showing that Jackson took lorazepam orally at some point before his death. Flanagan went going through different scenarios with Dr. White that this could have caused Jackson's death. Dr. White then demonstrated how to mix propofol and lidocaine inside a syringe and administered it through a saline drip and Y tube. White injected 5 mg of propofol/saline mix into a cup to show that propofol doesn't go up the IV line and propofol sticks to the plastic tubing. He said that this is certainly a very safe way to inject propofol, and it was only 25 mg. [...] "My demonstration was probably close to what happened at the scene. You'd need a mechanism to drip the drug and hold this heavy bottle." [...] Flanagan asked if he could envision anyone using a slit IV bag to hang the propofol bottle when there's handle on the bottle? [...] "No." [...] White added: [...] "Why would anyone go through the hassle of cutting a <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> to put bottle inside when bottle has a handle?" [...] Flanagan then asked how you would mix propofol solution with saline to make it 1-1 mg/ml? [...] "You pull tab off the bottle, spike top, then inject all the bottle of propofol into the <b>saline</b> <b>bag,</b> shaking the bag to make it 1-1 μg/ml." ...|$|E
5000|$|Next {{to testify}} was Elissa Fleak, a Los Angeles County coroner {{for the past}} eight years. [...] Her duties include {{investigating}} deaths (natural/suicide/homicide) and working with medical examiners to determine causes of death. Fleak went to UCLA Medical Center at 5:20 pm on June 25, 2009, to examine Jackson's body and get information surrounding his death. She examined the body in a private room, as well as notes and photographs, and looked for external wounds/injuries; any sign to signal the cause of death. None were found. She took four vials of Jackson's blood for toxicology testing and went to Jackson's house to perform an onsite investigation. While in Jackson's bedroom, she found an empty 20ml propofol bottle and an empty 5ml flumazenil bottle {{on the floor next to}} the bedside table. She also recovered other prescription drugs, such as diazepam, lorazepam, and tamsulosin (Flomax), one bottle prescribed to Mick Jackson, and some medicines prescribed by Alan Metzger. Other drugs found were Benoquin, hydroquinone, lidocaine, and an oxygen tank beside the bed. Medical equipment recovered included alcohol prep pads, a 10cc syringe with the needle removed, an IV catheter on the floor under an Ambu bag, an aspirin bottle, a syringe box, catheters, a jug of urine, and an IV pole with a <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> and tubing draped over it.|$|E
5000|$|During cross-examination, Rogers {{testified that}} the only {{evidence}} of propofol in the medical equipment was in the syringe, in the Y-connector and the tubing thereafter. None {{was found in the}} upper tubing or the IV <b>saline</b> <b>bag.</b> Defense council Flanagan asked [...] "Would 25 mg propofol pushed over 3-5minutes make the patient sleep?" [...] Rogers replied yes. Flanagan: [...] "How long would they sleep for?" [...] Rogers: [...] "Approximately 5 minutes." [...] Flanagan: [...] "So a 25 mg dose of propofol at 10:50 am would have no effect after 11.05?" [...] Rogers: [...] "Correct." [...] Flanagan: [...] "After this you would assume the patient sleeping was cause by something else and not propofol, wouldn't you?" [...] Rogers: [...] "Yes." [...] The therapeutic range of propofol required for major surgery was 4 μg/ml, and for lesser operations it was 2 μg/ml. Jackson had 2.6 μg/ml in his femoral blood, which is used for post-mortem examination because as it is not located near any large organs and is less prone to redistribution after death. Rogers stated that a lethal level of propofol has been documented anywhere between 1 and 17 μg/ml. Jackson's stomach level of lorazepam was 0.64 μg/ml, and his femoral blood level was 0.169 μg/ml. It was hypothesized that Jackson must have ingested lorazepam fairly close to the time of death for it not to have been absorbed and distributed yet. Flanagan: [...] "A 2 mg pill of lorazepam gets you to 0.018 μg/ml blood level?" [...] Rogers: [...] "Yes, in Shafer's literature." [...] Flanagan: [...] "If you pushed (all at once) a dose of lorazepam to get you to 0.169 μg/ml blood level, it would stop your heart, wouldn't it?" [...] Rogers: [...] "Yes." ...|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{the study}} were to {{evaluate}} the effects of oral contrast on apparent tracer activity measured with PET/CT when using CT attenuation correction and to report our initial experience in the use of oral contrast with PET/CT. Methods: Phantom studies with 18 F activity and <b>saline</b> <b>bags</b> or syringes filled with barium or gastrografin of varying densities were per-formed using a PET/CT scanner (CT attenuation correction). In the study, 91 clinical patients received dilute oral contrast and were evaluated by whole-body 18 F-FDG PET. Results: A phan-tom experiment with CT contrast (1. 3 % weight/volume [w/v] barium) showed a “cold ” area in the cold stomach whereas a phantom with high-density barium (98 % w/v) showed an arti-factual focus of intense “activity ” in the cold stomach.

40|$|Abstract Background Home {{hemodialysis}} {{is common}} in New Zealand and associated with lower cost, improved survival and better patient experience. We present {{the case of a}} fully trained home hemodialysis patient who exsanguinated at home {{as a result of an}} incorrect wash back procedure. Case presentation The case involves a 67 year old male with a history of well controlled hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance. He commenced on peritoneal dialysis in 2006 following the development of end stage kidney failure secondary to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. He transferred to hemodialysis due to peritoneal membrane failure in 2010, and successfully trained for home hemodialysis over a 20 week period. Following one month of uncomplicated dialysis at home, he was found deceased on his machine at home in the midst of dialysis. His death occurred during the wash back procedure performed using the “open circuit” method, and resulted from misconnection of the <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> to the venous end of the extracorporeal blood circuit instead of the arterial end. This led to approximately 2. 3 L of his blood being pumped into the <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> resulting in hypovolaemic shock and death from exsanguination. Conclusions Despite successful training, critical procedural errors can still be made by patients on home hemodialysis. In this case, the error involved misconnection of the <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> for wash back. This case should prompt providers of home hemodialysis to review their training protocols and manuals. Manufacturers of dialysis machinery should be encouraged to design machines specifically for home hemodialysis, and consider distinguishing the arterial and venous ends of the extracorporeal blood circuit with colour coding or incompatible connectivity, to prevent occurrences such as these in the future. </p...|$|E

5000|$|Charms has {{had breast}} {{augmentation}} surgery three times. The first augmentation enlarged {{her to an}} DD cup, the second to an HH. Both were <b>saline</b> <b>bags.</b> The third surgery implanted the polypropylene string, which has been since been abandoned as a common procedure in the United States and the European Union because of the potentially unlimited growth side effect, but {{has been used in}} breast enhancement surgery procedures in South America. More specifically, in some cases of breast augmentation via the polypropylene method, the breasts may grow at different paces and usually at sometimes dangerously accelerated rates. In her case, they have grown in unison, but their growth rate has steadily slowed over the years. The initial string content was equivalent to 2500cc. Her doctor estimates the growth has increased the size of each breast to over 15,000cc as of October 2011. She stated on her website news/blog and FAQ that number had increased to 18,000cc as of summer 2014 and then increased to 21,000 cc as of December 2014.|$|R
30|$|From July 2016, {{calibration}} of SPECT images {{was based}} on a series of 30 SPECT acquisitions of a 20 -mL vial placed {{in the center of the}} gamma camera FOV with a known activity of 177 Lu ranging from 114.7  MBq (3.1  mCi) to 7215  MBq (195  mCi). The 177 Lu calibration source was placed in the center of 8 1 -L <b>saline</b> <b>bags</b> with two additional 177 Lu sources in order to simulate an amount of scatter similar to a clinical scan. For scatter estimation, the dual energy window (DEW) method was used. This method consists of measuring the scatter in an energy window juxtaposed just below the main photopeak window (208  keV). Here, the scatter window was placed ±[*] 10 % around 166.4  keV as proposed by Beauregard et al. [24]. Then, a pixel-by-pixel correction subtracting the scatter counts from the main photopeak ones is done. This correction uses a weighting factor, which depends on the width of the main peak and scatter energy windows [25]. The measured paralyzing dead-time constant was 0.66 [*]±[*] 0.04  μs. However, no dead-time correction was applied.|$|R

These parameters include positioning of the patient with the long axis of metallic hardware parallel to 130, use of fast spin echo sequences, use of inversion recovery fat suppression, swapping phase and frequency encoding direction, use of view angle tilting, increasing the read-out bandwidth, and decreasing voxel size...|$|E
30|$|Because {{it was not}} {{possible}} to monitor the real temperature variation in the circuit induced by the different levels of heating device setting, in a preliminary phase, the hemofiltration circuit was set in vitro, using CRRT machine a (Multifiltrate generator, Fresenius medical Care; Bad Homburg, Germany) and polysulfone membrane (Ultraflux AV 1000 S, Fresenius medical Care; Bad Homburg, Germany). Access and return lines were connected to a 2, 000 -ml <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> placed on a heating device constantly set at 39 °C. Blood flow was set to 100 ml per min and ultrafiltration (UF) rate (2000 ml per h) was continuously compensated with saline at the same rate. A thermistor sensor (Hanna Instruments; NJ, USA) was inserted inside the bubble trap close to the tip of venous line. Temperature of the heating device incorporated to the Multifiltrate generator was first set to 36 °C then to 38 °C and back to 36 °C.|$|E
40|$|Cardiac tamponade is a {{life-threatening}} emergency for which pericardiocentesis may be required. Real-time bedside ultrasound has obviated {{the need for}} routine blind procedures in cardiac arrest {{and the number of}} pericardiocenteses being performed has declined. Despite this fact, pericardiocentesis remains an essential skill in emergency medicine. While commercially available training models exist, cost, durability, and lack of anatomical landmarks limit their usefulness. We sought to create a pericardiocentesis model that is realistic, simple to build, reusable, and cost efficient. The model was constructed utilizing a red dye filled ping-pong ball (simulating the left ventricle) and a 250 cc NS bag (simulating the effusion) encased in an artificial rib cage and held in place by gel-wax.   The inner <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> was connected to a 1 L <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> outside of the main assembly to act as a fluid reservoir for repeat uses. The entire construction process takes approximately 16 - 20 hours, most of which is attributed to cooling of the gel-wax. Actual construction time is approximately 4 hours at a cost of less than $ 200. The model was introduced to Emergency Medicine residents and medical students during a procedure simulation lab and compared to a model previously described by dell’Orto 1. The learners performed ultrasound guided pericardiocentesis using both models.   Learners were given a survey comparing realism of the two models.   Learners felt our model was more realistic than the previously described model.   On a scale of 1 - 9 with 9 being very realistic, the previous model was rated a 4. 5.   Our model was rated a 7. 8.   There was also a marked improvement in the perceived recognition of the pericardium, the heart, and the pericardial sac. Additionally, 100 % of the students were successful at performing the procedure using our model. In simulation, our model provided both palpable and ultrasound landmarks and held up to several months of repeated use. It was less expensive than commercial models ($ 200 vs upto $ 16, 500) while being more realistic in simulation than other described “DIY models”.   This model can be easily replicated to teach the necessary skill of pericardiocentesis...|$|E

This study aimed to assess HCW management system in Dhaka City (DC), Bangladesh, by investigating the present practices implemented by the city. In this study, five different healthcare establishments were selected in DC. Field visits and interviews with health personnel and staff who are concerned with the waste management were conducted. The information was gathered through questionnaire focus on the different aspect of HCW management like, waste segregation and collection, storage and transport, awareness as well. The results showed that a total of 7, 215 kg/day (7. 2 ton/day) of waste were generated, of which 79. 36 % (5. 6 ton/day) was non-hazardous waste and 20. 6 % (1. 5 ton/day) was hazardous waste. The rate of waste generation in these healthcare establishments (HCEs) was 2. 6 kg/bed/day. There was no appropriate and systematic management of HCWs except at few private HCEs that segregate their hazardous waste. All the surveyed HCEs dumped their HCW together with the municipal waste, and some staff members were also found to be engaged in improper handling of the generated waste.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To {{develop an}} {{affordable}} realistic open-chest extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) model for embedded in situ interprofessional crisis resource management training in emergency management of a post-cardiac surgery child. METHODS An innovative attachment to a high-fidelity mannequin (Laerdal Simbaby™) {{was used to}} enable a cardiac tamponade/ECMO standstill scenario. Two <b>saline</b> <b>bags</b> with blood dye were placed over the mannequin's chest. A ‘heart’ bag with venous and arterial outlets {{was connected to the}} corresponding tubes of the ECMO circuit. The bag was divided into arterial and venous parts by loosely wrapping silicon tubing around its centre. A ‘pericardial’ bag was placed above it. Both were then covered by a chest skin that had a sutured silicone membrane window. False blood injected into the ‘pericardial’ bag caused expansion leading to (i) bulging of silastic membrane, simulating tamponade, and (ii) compression of tubing around the ‘heart’ bag, creating negative venous pressures and cessation of ECMO flow. In situ Simulation Paediatric Resuscitation Team Training (SPRinT) was performed on paediatric intensive care unit; the course included a formal team training/scenario of an open-chest ECMO child with acute cardiac tamponade due to blocked chest drains/debriefing by trained facilitators. RESULTS Cardiac tamponade was reproducible, and ECMO flow/circuit pressure changes were effective and appropriate. There were eight participants: one cardiac surgeon, two intensivists, one cardiologist, one perfusionist and three nurses. Five of the eight reported the realism of the model and 6 / 8 the realism of the clinical scenario as highly effective. Eight of eight reported a highly effective impact on (i) their practice and (ii) teamwork. Six of eight reported a highly effective impact on communication skills and increased confidence in attending future real events. CONCLUSIONS Innovative adaptation of a high-fidelity mannequin for open-chest ECMO simulation can achieve a realistic and reproducible training model. The impact on interprofessional team training is promising but needs to be validated further...|$|R

40|$|Background. Comparative {{studies of}} {{ephedrine}} and phenylephrine in prevention of hypotension after spinal anaesthesia for Caesarean section have lacked {{a consensus on}} dose equivalence. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the minimum vasopressor dose for each of these drugs to calculate the dose ratio for clinical equivalence in the prevention of hypotension. Methods. Patients with a normal singleton pregnancy beyond 36 weeks gestation undergoing elective Caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia were randomized into two groups. The first patient in Group A received 50 mg of ephedrine in saline 0. 9 % w/v, 500 ml, at 999 ml h 1, the maximum rate possible on the pump and the first patient in Group B received 500 mg of phenylephrine in saline 0. 9 % w/v, 500 ml, at the same rate. The initial dose for dilution was an arbitrary choice. The dose of vasopressor in the <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> for every subsequent patient was established by the efficacy of the dose in preventing hypotension in the previous patient according to the technique of up–down sequential allocation. Minimum vasopressor dose for each drug was determined according to the Dixon–Massey formula. Results.

40|$|Open Access JournalReal-time intraocular {{pressure}} (IOP) recording is important during ophthalmic surgery. Optical fiber pressure sensor opSens has inherent advantages for small size and immunity to electromagnetic interferences, and their accuracy and stability promoted the applications in medical science. In this study, we aimed {{to monitor and}} compare real-time IOP in rabbit eyes using rebound tonometer Tonovet and intra-vitreous pressure sensor opSens under different pressure conditions. IOP change was controlled by anterior chamber cannulation connected to a saline irrigation container at different heights. IOP was measured in 12 rabbits. OpSens sensor was inserted into the posterior chamber of the rabbit eye. At least ten Tonovet readings were recorded and averaged for each height. The rabbit eye level was set as 0 cm. The height of the <b>saline</b> <b>bag</b> was set at 30, 60, 90 and 120 cmH 2 O. It induced hydrostatic pressure at 22. 07, 44. 13, 66. 2, 88. 26 mmHg, respectively. At these irrigation heights, the opSens reading was 20. 95 Â± 2. 79, 44. 37 Â± 2. 29, 65. 03 Â± 3. 71, 86. 00 Â± 3. 88 mmHg, Tonovet measurements were 14. 54 Â± 3. 01, 25. 93 Â± 3. 44, 45. 56 Â± 3. 92, 62. 14 Â± 6. 69 mmHg. Tonovet underestimated IOP values especially when the IOP was much higher than 60 mmHg in rabbits. In conclusion, opSens reflected more reliable real time IOP reading in rabbits that make it more appropriate for IOP monitor during surgery especially in those procedures might induce elevation of IOP. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Medical {{waste is}} {{infectious}} and hazardous. It poses serious threats to {{environmental health and}} requires specific treatment and management prior to its final disposal. The problem is growing with an ever-increasing number of hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic laboratories in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. However, research on this critical issue has been very limited, {{and there is a}} serious dearth of information for planning. This paper seeks to document the handling practice of waste (e. g. collection, storage, transportation and disposal) along with the types and amount of wastes generated by Health Care Establishments (HCE). A total of 60 out of the existing 68 HCE in the study areas provided us with relevant information. Methods The methodology for this paper includes empirical field observation and field-level data collection through inventory, questionnaire survey and formal and informal interviews. A structured questionnaire was designed to collect information addressing the generation of different medical wastes according to amount and sources from different HCE. A number of in-depth interviews were arranged to enhance our understanding of previous and existing management practice of medical wastes. A number of specific questions were asked of nurses, hospital managers, doctors, and cleaners to elicit their knowledge. The collected data with the questionnaire survey were analysed, mainly with simple descriptive statistics; while the qualitative mode of analysis is mainly in narrative form. Results The paper shows that the surveyed HCE generate a total of 5, 562 kg/day of wastes, of which about 77. 4 per cent are non-hazardous and about 22. 6 per cent are hazardous. The average waste generation rate for the surveyed HCE is 1. 9 kg/bed/day or 0. 5 kg/patient/day. The study reveals that there is no proper, systematic management of medical waste except in a few private HCE that segregate their infectious wastes. Some cleaners were found to salvage used sharps, <b>saline</b> <b>bags,</b> blood bags and test tubes for resale or reuse. Conclusion The paper reveals that lack of awareness, appropriate policy and laws, and willingness are responsible for the improper management of medical waste in Dhaka City. The paper also shows that a newly designed medical waste management system currently serves a limited number of HCE. New facilities should be established for the complete management of medical waste in Dhaka City. </p...|$|R
30|$|All 24 {{patients}} {{included in}} the study underwent a planar whole-body examination under a gamma camera after each cycle of treatment. Additionally, SPECT/CTs of the abdomen including the kidneys, liver, and spleen were acquired 18  h, 25  h, and 7  days after the injection of the first therapeutic dose in order to estimate the pharmacokinetics of [177 Lu]-DOTA-TATE in these organs. For the following treatments, patients underwent a single SPECT/CT about 20  h after the administration of the radiopharmaceutical, assuming minor changes in the effective half-life for organs of interest [12]. All images were acquired on a Discovery NM/CT 670 camera with anatomical image capability (International General Electric, General Electric Medical Systems, Haifa, Israel). This system combines a dual-head coincidence SPECT camera with an axial field of view (FOV) of 40 [*]×[*] 54  cm, a NaI(Tl) crystal thickness of 9.5  mm, and 59 photomultiplier tubes (PMT). All functional images were acquired with a 20 % energy window around the main photopeak of 177 Lu (208  keV; 11 % probability) [20] with medium-energy general purpose (MEGP) collimators. Whole body images were acquired with step-and-shoot mode (180  s per view; about 20  min acquisition) in a 256 [*]×[*] 1024 matrix, zoom 1.0, and body contour. SPECT imaging was performed applying 60 views over 360 ° (30 angular steps per head, 6 ° angle step) with a 30  s exposure per frame (15  min acquisition) in a 128 [*]×[*] 128 matrix size (4.4  mm pixels), zoom 1.0, and body contour. Anatomical CT images were acquired before each SPECT acquisition with the integrated BrightSpeed multidetector CT (24 rows – maximum 16 slices/rotation) using a tube voltage of 120  kV and the smart current option (80 – 220  mA). Calibration of SPECT images was based on a series of 29 SPECT acquisitions of a 20 -mL vial placed {{in the center of the}} gamma camera FOV with a known activity of 177 Lu ranging from 114.7  MBq (3.1  mCi) to 7215  MBq (195  mCi). The 177 Lu calibration source was placed in the center of eight 1 -L <b>saline</b> <b>bags</b> with two additional distant 20 -mL 177 Lu sources in order to simulate an amount of scatter similar to a clinical scan. However, no scatter correction was applied, and thus, contributions from scattered photons were ignored. No dead time was observed during calibration. This study was performed entirely independently of the camera vendor.|$|R
