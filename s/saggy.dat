25|$|Carry Back, a {{dark brown}} horse, raced {{in the blue}} and silver colors of retired {{manufacturer}} Jack Price, who bred the colt at the Ocala Stud in Marion County, Florida. Price trained the colt for his wife, Katherine. In early 1958, Price took over ownership of an obscure mare named Joppy for a fee of $150 plus a $150 overdue board bill at his Ohio farm. Joppy's racing record was poor. In seven starts, she finished second twice and earned only $325. Joppy was eventually banned from racing, {{a result of her}} frequent refusals to leave the starting gate. For a modest $400 stud fee, Price bred Joppy to a stallion named <b>Saggy.</b> Saggy's only real claim to fame was that in April 1948 he handed Citation the only loss of his Triple Crown winning season with a one length win in the Chesapeake Trial at Havre de Grace Racetrack.|$|E
500|$|Elephants are {{ubiquitous}} in Western popular culture as emblems of the exotic, especially since – {{as with the}} giraffe, hippopotamus and rhinoceros – there are no similar animals familiar to Western audiences. The use of the elephant {{as a symbol of}} the US Republican Party began with an 1874 cartoon by Thomas Nast. As characters, elephants are most common in children's stories, in which they are generally cast as models of exemplary behaviour. They are typically surrogates for humans with ideal human values. Many stories tell of isolated young elephants returning to a close-knit community, such as [...] "The Elephant's Child" [...] from Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories, Disney's Dumbo, and Kathryn and Byron Jackson's The <b>Saggy</b> Baggy Elephant. Other elephant heroes given human qualities include Jean de Brunhoff's Babar, David McKee's Elmer, and Dr. Seuss's Horton.|$|E
500|$|Conway {{described}} the panel as indicating [...] "an astonishing depth of psychological insight" [...] {{for an artist}} not yet 20 years old. In its simple design and detail it shares many of the characteristics of, and is a key precursor to, Dürer's mature work. He [...] portrayed his father again in 1497, when the older man would have been around 70. He has aged noticeably in the intervening seven years: his skin is <b>saggier,</b> the wrinkles deeper and more pronounced. In this later portrait Dürer seems at pains to convey these effects of ageing, which are all too evident on his father's face. According to Brion, his eyes have lost their [...] "distant, mystic" [...] appearance and now seem less contented. Conway agrees, seeing traces of haggardly agitation, but holds that the two paintings convey a similar overall highly favourable and compassionate impression of the man.|$|R
500|$|Ford {{sponsored}} legislation {{defining a}} hate crime [...] "as an assault, intimidation or threat based on 'actual or perceived' race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin and sexual orientation." [...] He also introduced several bills concerning gay rights in lodging, hospital visitation rights and partnerships. His partnership bill would provide for civil unions in South Carolina. The effort was judged by state senator Mike Fair as predetermined to fail, but Ford cited the Democratic National Committee's platform on the issue and argued that Barack Obama's election showed that a change should be attempted. Even if passed, the measure would be unenforceable, due to a constitutional amendment banning unions similar to marriage in South Carolina. Ford worked to outlaw profanity and <b>saggy</b> pants and to keep music from minors that is [...] "profane, vulgar, lewd, lascivious or indecent." [...] Ford argued he did not expect these proposals to be approved but {{wanted to start a}} discussion specifically targeting young African American men's fashion as well as rap music. He stated: [...] "You don't have to emulate prisoners no more. You can emulate somebody like Barack Obama." ...|$|E

Stacey Anderson of Spin commented that its first disc [...] "meanders over [...] down-tempo cuts" [...] and called ...Sasha [...] "an intriguing but diluted direction". The Village Voices Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond felt that the I Am... disc lacks cohesion, but complimented [...] "Sasha Fierce as [...] "brassy, big-headed, confrontational, and witty," [...] and stated, [...] "each incendiary track challenges you to leave your inhibitions at coat-check." [...] Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone noted that its slow songs are [...] "full of bland self-affirmation and <b>saggy</b> lines", but wrote that [...] "the [...] "Sasha" [...] disc boasts Beyoncé's most adventurous music yet". Colin McGuire of PopMatters called the album [...] "a little rough around the edges at times" [...] and viewed its Sasha Fierce disc as [...] "a far more compelling trip down dance-lane". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the album offers [...] "two compelling sides" [...] of Beyoncé and stated: [...] "The collection {{might have been better}} served had she edited it down to one disc, rather than belabor what ultimately seems like a marketing gimmick. And while fans will surely speculate, there's little in the lyrics that feels more revealing than previous emotional fire-starters." [...] Sasha Frere-Jones from The New Yorker found the album to be [...] "something of a mess", mostly because the alter ego [...] "trips on the idea of redefinition".|$|E
500|$|Dave Golder of SFX {{magazine}} gave [...] "The Eleventh Hour" [...] {{five out}} of five stars, thinking that Moffat captured [...] "the way children perceive the Doctor" [...] and praising the debuts of Smith and Gillan. The A.V. Club reviewer Keith Phipps gave the episode an A-, explaining that he liked Smith [...] "a lot" [...] but was not sure if the Eleventh Doctor was separate enough from the Tenth yet. He called Gillan [...] "instantly winning" [...] and that the story was [...] "no exception" [...] from Moffat's typical [...] "exceptionally strong narratives, keen sense of character, and efficient plotting". Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune stated that the episode [...] "works" [...] as an introduction, though it could be [...] "almost too jokey at times". Though she felt the series was in good hands with Smith and Gillan, she derided the Atraxi for being [...] "alarmingly static and ultimately uninteresting" [...] and the story's [...] "little substance". IGN's Matt Wales rated the episode 8 out of 10, praising it for easily fitting into the show's continuity, especially with Smith's portrayal of the Doctor. However, he thought the [...] "calamity plot" [...] was the [...] "weakest link in an otherwise superb opening episode" [...] and the [...] "whole bunch of disparate elements ... never [...] into a satisfying whole". Though {{he said it was}} not perfect with [...] "a <b>saggy</b> midsection and slightly naff CGI effects", he thought it was still [...] "wondrous in so many ways". New York Times reviewer Mike Hale wrote that the episode worked like [...] "a well-oiled piece of machinery", but it came across as [...] "routine" [...] with [...] "none of the over-the-top exuberance" [...] of Davies' run. While he noted that Gillan [...] "looks promising", he felt that Smith was too much like Tennant and would [...] " [...] to start shaping his own take on the role".|$|E

The {{series of}} 13 episodes was first broadcast from 12 February 1974 to 7 May 1974 through their company Smallfilms. The title character was [...] "a <b>saggy,</b> old cloth cat, baggy, {{and a bit}} loose at the seams".

2500|$|Each {{programme}} {{began in}} the same way: {{through a series of}} sepia photographs, the viewer is told of a little girl named Emily (played by Emily Firmin, the daughter of illustrator Firmin), who owned a shop. Emily found lost and broken things and displayed them in the window, so their owners could come and collect them; the shop did not sell anything. She would leave the object in front of her favourite stuffed toy, the large, <b>saggy,</b> pink and white striped cat named Bagpuss, originally intended by Firmin to be a retired Indian Army cat who entertained children in the hospital with his [...] "visible" [...] thoughts appearing in a [...] "thinks bubble" [...] above his head.
