5|$|One form {{of apple}} allergy, {{often found in}} {{northern}} Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome, and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen. Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples {{that is similar to}} birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Reactions, which entail oral allergy syndrome (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat, but in rare cases can also include life-threatening anaphylaxis. This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple, maturity and <b>storage</b> <b>conditions</b> can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.|$|E

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was performed in}} order to study on ageing mechanisms of chickpea seeds (Cicer arietinum L.) in natural storage and accelerated ageing conditions in seed laboratory of Gorgan Agricultural Science and Natural Resources, Gorgan, Iran at 2015. Experiment was in completely randomized design arrangement with four replications. Treatments were 2 and 4 years natural storage and 1 - 5 days of accelerated ageing with control treatment. The results showed that with increasing of natural storage and accelerated ageing duration, germination percentage was decreased. Increasing of ageing duration decreased soluble sugars, non-reducing sugars and soluble proteins but lipid peroxidation, reducing sugars, protein carbonylation and Amadori and Millard reaction were increased. In natural <b>storage</b> <b>condition</b> lipid peroxidation was more than sugar hydrolysis but in accelerated ageing condition sugar hydrolysis was more than lipid peroxidation.

Methods: Low temperatures control bacterial histamine formation during fish processing. The shelf life of sardine (sardine sindensis) during storage at ambient temperature (33 °C), ice box temperature (0 °C) and freezing temperature (- 7 °C) were studied in terms of sensory and histamine production. The sensory acceptability limit was up to one day at ambient temperature and 11 days at ice <b>storage</b> <b>condition.</b> However, freezing <b>storage</b> had a good preserving effect on sensory acceptability at the end of experiment. The formation of histamine was determined at day 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 16 and 18 of experiment using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fluorometeric method. Results: Histamine development had not exceeded the permissible level (200 mg/kg) recommended by the FAO (2012) during <b>storage</b> <b>condition</b> at - 7 °C throughout the experiment. At 0 °C, histamine concentration was lower than safe level for up to 16 days (135 mg/kg).
