Currently, it falls under {{the organization of the}} 1st Armored Division, having relocated as part of the Base Realignment and Closure 2005. This assignment allows the unit maximum flexibility when deployed, as it can provide any <b>support</b> <b>function</b> needed, without being permanently attached to any particular unit or area of operations.|$|E

Shafer [1] defined weights of {{evidence}} {{and the weight of}} internal conflict for separable <b>support</b> <b>functions.</b> He also formulated a conjecture, the weight-ofconflict conjecture, which implies that these definitions can be extended in a natural way to all <b>support</b> <b>functions.</b> In this paper I show that the extension to <b>support</b> <b>functions</b> can be carried out whether or not the weight-of-conflict conjecture is true. ...|$|R

Multi-site <b>support</b> <b>functions,</b> {{which are}} linear combinations of pseudo-atomic orbitals on a target atom and those neighbours within a cutoff, have been recently proposed {{to reduce the}} number of <b>support</b> <b>functions</b> to the minimal basis while keeping the accuracy of a large basis [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2014, 10, 4813]. The coefficients were determined by using the local filter diagonalization (LFD) method [Phys. Rev. B, 2009, 80, 205104]. We analyse the effect of numerical optimization of the coefficients produced by the LFD method. Tests on crystalline silicon, a benzene molecule and hydrated DNA systems show that the optimization improves the accuracy of the multi-site <b>support</b> <b>functions</b> with small cutoffs. It is also confirmed that the optimization guarantees the variational energy minimizations with multi-site <b>support</b> <b>functions.</b> Comment: 25 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Phys. Chem.

25|$|The {{water line}} is built {{up by the}} coronet and by the wall's corium (the living tissue {{immediately}} beneath the walls). Its thickness increases proportionally to {{the distance from the}} coronet and, in the lower third of the walls, is thicker than the pigmented layer. It is very resistant to contact to the ground, and it serves mainly a <b>support</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E
25|$|Local {{functions}} can {{be defined}} {{in the body of}} another method, constructor or property’s getter and setter. Such functions have access to all variables in the enclosing scope, including parent method local variables. They are in scope for the entire method, regardless of whether they’re invoked before or after their declaration. Access modifiers (public, private, protected) cannot be used with local functions. Also they do not <b>support</b> <b>function</b> overloading. It means there cannot be two local functions in the same method with the same name even if the signatures don’t overlap. After a compilation, a local function is transformed into a private static method, but when defined it cannot be marked static.|$|E
25|$|Nova wears a {{standard}} Xandarian StarCorps uniform, {{designed to accommodate}} his powers without being damaged by them. The uniform is highly resistant to damage, including outer space conditions, and is airtight. In addition, the uniform has a built-in life <b>support</b> <b>function</b> that can sustain Rider under the most extreme environmental conditions, including acting as a life-support suit by locking off the mouth and eyes of the helmet. The helmet contains a radio, telescopic sights, night vision sensors, and heat imaging sensors, {{as well as a}} visual heads-up display for tracking energy signatures. Nova's helmet has a rigid construction and shape when worn, but becomes as malleable as cloth when it is not, allowing Rider to hide it in his civilian clothes when desired. Nova's uniform is not only extremely malleable, but contains specific functions to aid Rider in his role as a Nova Corps Centurion. Among these features are an electromagnetic discharge that can nullify gravity and an interface to stargates that allow him to enter hyperspace, where he can move at velocities exceeding the speed of light. Rider can also alter the appearance and nature of his uniform to suit his needs. However, as Rider learns the hard way, the Nova Corps keeps a strict dress code. When he makes major cosmetic changes to his uniform after rejoining the New Warriors, Nova is summarily ordered to conform to standard.|$|E

500|$|The {{authority}} and {{position of the}} design management function has a large influence on what the design manager does {{in his or her}} daily job. Kootstra (2006) distinguishes design management types by organisational function: design management as line function, design management as staff function, and design management as <b>support</b> <b>function.</b> Design management as a [...] "line function" [...] is directly responsible for design execution in the [...] "primary" [...] organisational process and can take place on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in the line are authority over and direct responsibility for the result. Design management as a staff function is not directly responsible for design execution in the [...] "primary" [...] organisational process, but consults as a specialist on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in this function are their limited {{authority and}} the need to consult line managers and staff. When the design process is defined as a [...] "secondary" [...] organisational process, design management is seen as [...] "supportive function". In this function it has only a supportive character, classifying the design manager as a creative specialist towards product management, brand management, marketing, R, and communication.
