60|$|<b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> shame's <b>being</b> {{a dreadful}} and horrible thing. But again, it {{is a spiritual}} thing: it grows and works not in our fleshly bodies, but in our spirits, our consciences, our immortal souls. You may see this by {{thinking}} {{of people who are}} not afraid of shame. You do not respect them, or think them the better for that. Not at all. If a man is not afraid of shame; if a man, when he is found out, and exposed, and comes to shame, does not care for it, but 'brazens out his own shame,' as we say, we do not call him brave; we call him what he is, a base impudent person, lost to all good feeling. Why, what harder name can we call any man or woman, than to say that they are 'shameless,' dead to shame? We know that it is the very sign of their being dead in sin, the very sign of God's Spirit having left them; that till they are made to feel shame there is no hope of their mending or repenting, or of any good being put into them, or coming out of them. So that this feeling of shame is a spiritual feeling, which {{has to do with a}} man's immortal soul, with his conscience, and the voice of God in his heart.|$|R

50|$|Brown's {{first term}} as {{governor}} was very successful, but failings on important matters to him were costly. Agriculture and special interests defeated his {{best efforts to}} pass a $1.25 per hour minimum wage, and Brown's opposition to capital punishment was overruled by the practice's being supported statewide. As a supporter of Senator John F. Kennedy in the 1960 Presidential election, Brown's California delegation to the Democratic National Convention did not abide by his support for Kennedy, which nearly cost Kennedy his nomination. Brown's opponent in 1962 was former Vice President Richard Nixon. Having narrowly lost the Presidency to John F. Kennedy in 1960, Nixon {{was not interested in}} the governorship of his native California <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> a path to the White House.

It was not sixty years ago, that a nobleman was laughed at in the House of Lords for saying that he believed that we should one day see ships go by steam; and now there are steamers on every sea and ocean in the world. Who expected twenty years ago to see the whole face of England covered with these wonderful railroads? Who expected on the 22nd of February last year, that, within a single month, half the nations of Europe, which looked so quiet and secure, would be shaken from top to bottom with revolution and bloodshed--kings and princes vanishing one after the other like a dream--poor men sitting for a day as rulers of kingdoms, and then hurled down again to make room for other rulers as unexpected as themselves? Can anyone consider the last fifty years?-- can anyone consider that one last year, 1848, and then not feel that we do live in a most strange and awful time? a time for which nothing is too surprising--a time in which we all ought to be prepared, from the least to the greatest, to see the greatest horrors and the greatest blessings come suddenly upon us, like a thief in the night? <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Christ's coming <b>being</b> too wonderful a thing to happen just now.
