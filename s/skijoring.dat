5|$|Australian Cattle Dogs {{have been}} {{successful}} in a range of dog sports including weight pulling, flyball and schutzhund. The breed is particularly suited to activities that a dog can share with its owner such as canicross, disc dog, and <b>skijoring</b> or bikejoring. It is an effective hiking companion because of its natural endurance, its general lack of interest in hunting, and preference for staying by its owner's side. Most Australian Cattle Dogs love the water and are excellent swimmers. It is not a hyperactive breed, and once one has had its exercise, it is happy to lie at its owner's feet, or to rest in its bed or crate while keeping an ear and eye open for signs of pending activity. The Australian Cattle Dog is an adaptable dog that can accept city or indoor living conditions, if its considerable exercise and companionship needs are met.|$|E
5|$|The Winter Games {{have evolved}} since their inception. Sports and {{disciplines}} {{have been added}} and some of them, such as Alpine skiing, luge, short track speed skating, freestyle skiing, skeleton, and snowboarding, have earned a permanent spot on the Olympic programme. Some others, including curling and bobsleigh, have been discontinued and later reintroduced; others have been permanently discontinued, such as military patrol, though the modern Winter Olympic sport of biathlon is descended from it. Still others, such as speed skiing, bandy and <b>skijoring,</b> were demonstration sports but never incorporated as Olympic sports. The rise of television as a global medium for communication enhanced {{the profile of the}} Games. It generated income via the sale of broadcast rights and advertising, which has become lucrative for the IOC. This allowed outside interests, such as television companies and corporate sponsors, to exert influence. The IOC has had to address several criticisms, internal scandals, the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Winter Olympians, as well as a political boycott of the Winter Olympics. Nations have used the Winter Games to proclaim the superiority of their political systems.|$|E

50|$|Huston and his teammates, Tobias Thorleifsson, Hugh Dale-Harris, and Kyle O’Donoghue, retraced {{portions}} of Norwegian explorer Otto Sverdrup’s 2nd Fram expedition on Ellesmere Island. They made the documentary film Mystery of the Arctic Cairn about their journey. The team <b>skijored</b> over 600 miles in 65 days.|$|R
25|$|<b>Skijoring</b> is an {{alternative}} to sled pulling, but mainly used in somewhat the same environment as sledding with the exception that the owner (cross-country skier) does not need a full pack in order to participate.|$|E
25|$|Mushing is a {{sport or}} {{transport}} method powered by dogs. It includes carting, pulka, scootering, sled dog racing, <b>skijoring,</b> freighting, and weight pulling. More specifically, it implies {{the use of}} one or more dogs to pull a sled on snow or a rig on dry land.|$|E
25|$|Functional breeds, {{which are}} purpose-bred dogs whose {{ancestors}} are not purebred, but rather are selected by their performance {{at a particular}} tasks. Examples of this are the Alaskan Husky, the Eurohound, and the Pointer/Greyhound mixes referred to as Greysters, which compete at <b>skijoring</b> and pulka races, particularly in Europe. Occasionally a functional breed such as this becomes accepted as a breed over time.|$|E
25|$|Canadian Eskimo Dogs need a {{very large}} amount of exercise. They cannot just be walked, they need higher {{intensity}} work, requiring more exercise than many dog owners can give. This need for work and stimulation makes them well-suited for dog sports, such as carting, mushing, and <b>skijoring.</b> They are very trainable and submissive, unlike many spitz breeds, as well as intelligent. The Canadian Eskimo Dog is best kept in a cold climate, and is prone to heatstroke. Its coat is fairly easy to care for most times of the year, needing brushing {{only one or two}} times a week. However, when it sheds (which happens once a year) it will need grooming every day.|$|E
500|$|Winter {{tourism in}} Banff began in February 1917, {{with the first}} Banff Winter Carnival. It was marketed to a {{regional}} middle class audience, and became the centerpiece of local boosters aiming to attract visitors, which [...] were a low priority for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The carnival featured a large ice palace, which in 1917 was built by World War I internees. Carnival events included cross-country skiing, ski jumping, curling, snowshoe, and <b>skijoring.</b> In the 1930s, the first downhill ski resort, Sunshine Village, {{was developed by the}} Brewsters. Mount Norquay ski area was also developed during the 1930s, with the first chair lift installed there in 1948.|$|E
500|$|Demonstration {{sports have}} {{historically}} provided {{a venue for}} host countries to attract publicity to locally popular sports by having a competition without granting medals. Demonstration sports were discontinued after 1992. [...] Military patrol, a precursor to the biathlon, was a medal sport in 1924 and was demonstrated in 1928, 1936 and 1948, becoming an official sport in 1960. [...] The special figures figure skating event was only contested at the 1908 Summer Olympics. [...] Bandy (Russian hockey) is a sport popular in the Nordic countries and Russia. In the latter it's considered a national sport. [...] It was demonstrated at the Oslo Games. Ice stock sport, a German variant of curling, was demonstrated in 1936 in Germany and 1964 in Austria. [...] The ski ballet event, later known as ski-acro, was demonstrated in 1988 and 1992. [...] <b>Skijöring,</b> skiing behind dogs, was a demonstration sport in St. Moritz in 1928. [...] A sled-dog race was held at Lake Placid in 1932. [...] Speed skiing was demonstrated in Albertville at the 1992 Winter Olympics. [...] Winter pentathlon, {{a variant of the}} modern pentathlon, was included as a demonstration event at the 1948 Games in Switzerland. It included cross-country skiing, shooting, downhill skiing, fencing and horse riding.|$|E
60|$|He mentioned, I remember, {{the case}} of a friend of his whose machine got {{entangled}} with a goat chain and who was dragged seven miles--like <b>skijoring</b> in Switzerland--so that he was never the same man again. And there was one chap who ran into an elephant, left over from a travelling circus.|$|E
50|$|The USA {{held the}} world's largest <b>Skijoring</b> event in February 2011 at the City of Lakes Loppet in Minneapolis. 200 <b>Skijoring</b> teams raced in this event which {{included}} the first ever National <b>Skijoring</b> Championship.|$|E
5000|$|Variations of <b>skijoring</b> include snowboarding while hitched to a dog, and [...] "grassjoring," [...] <b>skijoring</b> on grassy fields {{rather than}} snow.|$|E
50|$|<b>Skijoring</b> {{behind a}} horse {{is said to}} have {{originated}} as a method of winter travel, but today is primarily a competitive sport. <b>Skijoring</b> was a demonstration sport in the 1928 Winter Olympics.|$|E
5000|$|The World <b>Skijoring</b> Championship classes {{include the}} Open Pick & Draw class (for the top skiers, {{including}} some former U.S. Ski Team competitors and fastest horses), the Sport Class, the Black Star Mule Class (where all skiers {{are required to}} be pulled by a mule), and the Great Northern Novice Class, {{in addition to the}} long jump class. While skijoriing in Whitefish began in the 1960s, the [...] "modern era" [...] of <b>skijoring</b> was re-instituted in 2003 by long-time locals Scott Ping and Dale Duff. The World <b>Skijoring</b> Championships has even spawned a local recreational <b>skijoring</b> league. This annual event has some of the lowest entry fees and used to boast the largest added money and largest purse. The first annual <b>Skijoring</b> Championships in the neighboring town of Lakeside, Montana held New Years weekend of 2017 now holds the record for the most added money and largest purse.|$|E
50|$|The <b>skijoring</b> belt worn by {{the skier}} is a wide {{waistband}} which is clipped around the skier's waist, and which may include leg loops {{to keep it in}} position. Rock Climbing harnesses are also commonly used as <b>skijoring</b> belts.|$|E

50|$|Many breeds of dog {{participate}} in <b>skijoring.</b> The only prerequisite is {{a desire to}} run down a trail and pull, which is innate in many dogs. Small dogs (less than 40 pounds) are rarely seen <b>skijoring,</b> {{because they do not}} greatly assist the skier; however, since the skier can provide as much power as is required to travel, any enthusiastic dog can participate. Athletic dogs such as Pointers, Setters and herding breeds take to <b>skijoring</b> with glee, as do the northern breeds, such as Siberian and Alaskan Huskies, Malamutes, Samoyeds, and Inuit dogs; however, any large energetic dog is capable of enjoying this sport. Golden Retrievers, Giant Schnauzers, Labs, and many cross-breeds are seen in harness. Pulling breeds work well also such as American Bull Terriers, Staffordshire Terriers, American bull dogs, and mastiffs.|$|E
50|$|Bikejoring is a dog mushing {{activity}} {{related to}} <b>skijoring,</b> canicross, and dog scootering. It is a recreation or sport where a harnessed dog or team of dogs {{attached to a}} towline have to pull and run ahead of a cyclist. Bikejoring is a non snow season (dryland) activity. Bikejoring and canicross are both dryland mushing activities that probably developed from <b>skijoring</b> and dogsled racing. Bikejoring is also sometimes used to train racing sled-dogs out of season.|$|E
50|$|Skijor {{races are}} held in many {{countries}} where there is snow in winter. Most races are between 5 kilometers and 20 kilometers in length. The longest race is the KALEVALA held in Kalevala, Karelia, Russia, with a distance of 440 km. Next is the River Runner 120 held in Whitehorse, Yukon, with a distance of 120 mi. In the United States and Canada, <b>skijoring</b> races are often held in conjunction with sled dog races, <b>skijoring</b> being just one category of race that occurs during the day's activities. In Scandinavia, skijor racing is tightly associated with the older Scandinavian sport of Pulka. <b>Skijoring</b> races are not normally limited to purebred Northern breed dogs such as the Siberian Husky. On the contrary, the top ranked racing teams {{in the world are}} German Shorthaired Pointers, Pointer/Greyhound mixes, Alaskan Huskies, or crosses between these breeds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Skijoring</b> {{with a dog}} is a {{sport in}} which a dog (or dogs) assist a {{cross-country}} skier. One to three dogs are commonly used. The cross-country skier provides power with skis and poles, and the dog adds additional power by running and pulling. The skier wears a <b>skijoring</b> harness, the dog wears a sled dog harness, and the two are connected by a length of rope. There are no reins or other signaling devices to control the dog; the dog must be motivated by its own desire to run, {{and respond to the}} owner's voice for direction.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Skijoring</b> is an {{alternative}} to sled pulling, but mainly used in somewhat the same environment as sledding with the exception that the owner (cross-country skier) does not need a full pack in order to participate.|$|E
50|$|Although {{still used}} for {{recreational}} dog sledding by some owners, Chinooks today {{appear to be}} used largely as family pets. Individuals are also used for dog-packing, search and rescue, <b>skijoring,</b> and obedience and dog agility trials.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Skijoring</b> (pronounced [...] ) is {{a winter}} sport {{where a person}} on skis is pulled by a horse, a dog (or dogs) or a motor vehicle. It {{is derived from the}} Norwegian word skikjøring meaning ski driving.|$|E
50|$|Mushing is a {{sport or}} {{transport}} method powered by dogs. It includes carting, pulka, scootering, sled dog racing, <b>skijoring,</b> freighting, and weight pulling. More specifically, it implies {{the use of}} one or more dogs to pull a sled on snow or a rig on dry land.|$|E
5000|$|The World <b>Skijoring</b> Championships {{have been}} held in Whitefish, Montana since 2009, {{as a part of}} the annual Whitefish Winter Carnival, usually the last weekend of January. The 2011 World <b>Skijoring</b> Championships had an actual purse of $19,580 and 91 teams, and also {{featured}} a [...] "Murdoch's Long Jump" [...] competition as a separate class, where a horseman pulls a skier straight ahead as fast as possible, with the skier jumping for maximum distance, similar to gelandesprung, but landing on the flat. Skiers are required to land upright. Some teams emphasize a speed-acceleration [...] "crack-the-whip" [...] effect by either having the horse veer to the side immediately before the jump, or the skier will carve his or her own crack-the-whip before attempting the jump. The long jump itself is an 8-10 foot jump and the 2011 winning distance was 56 feet.|$|E
50|$|Canicross is {{the sport}} of cross country running with dogs. Originating in Europe as {{off-season}} training for the mushing (sledding) community, it has become popular as a stand-alone sport all over Europe, especially in the UK. Canicross {{is closely related to}} Bikejoring, where participants cycle with their dog and <b>skijoring,</b> where participants ski rather than run.|$|E
50|$|<b>Skijoring</b> {{dogs are}} taught the classic dog sledding {{commands}} to start running (hike), turn (gee and haw—right and left respectively in the US), to stop (whoa) and to pass distractions (on by). Training is best done on foot, before the person straps on their skis, {{to avoid being}} pulled into objects, like trees or half-frozen creeks.|$|E
