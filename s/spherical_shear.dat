The numerical method is built upon a fictitious domain approach which consists in defining the fluid-structure problem over the whole domain (fluid+solid). In the Newtonian case, the resulting variational formulation, although classical, uses non-standard functional spaces which include the rigidity constraints. From the numerical point of view, these constraints can be addressed by penalty methods, leading to the possible use of standard finite elements solvers with fixed structured meshes.

The spheres on these new trajectories do not pass each other (as they would in free space) but instead they swap their cross-streamline positions. To determine the significance of the wall-induced particle migration, we have evaluated the hydrodynamic self-diffusion coefficient associated with a sequence of uncorrelated particle displacements due to binary particle encounters. The results of our calculations quantitatively agree with the experimental value obtained by Zarraga-Leighton: 2002 for the self-diffusivity in a dilute suspension of spheres undergoing shear flow in a Couette device.

The amplitude of the axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field depends on the wavenumber of the Rossby mode, and hence on the width of the zonal jets. We discuss the plausibility of this dynamo mechanism for generating the magnetic field of the giant planets. Our results suggest a possible link between the topology of the magnetic field and the profile of the zonal winds observed at the surface of the giant planets.

In this paper, 2 D and 3 D fault gouges are simu-lated as two rectangular elastic blocks of bonded particles, separated by a region of randomly sized non-bonded <b>spherical</b> gouge particles, <b>sheared</b> in opposite directions by normally-loaded driving plates. The dynamic behav-ior of multiple model parameterisations is analysed by examining instantaneous macroscopic fault friction (µI) statistics. The response of the mean macroscopic friction is characterised for varying values of inter-particle (microscopic) friction µP in 2 D and 3 D and for non-rotational and rotational particle dynamics. In the non-rotational models, realistic angular gouge mean macroscopic friction values (E[µI] ≈ 0. 6) are obtained in the simulations for a 2 D inter-particle friction value of µP = 0. 3 and 3 D value of µP = 0. 2.

40|$|International audienceSuspensions of non-Brownian <b>spherical</b> {{particles}} undergoing <b>shear</b> {{provide a}} unique system where mixing occurs spontaneously at low Reynolds numbers. Through {{a combination of}} experiments and simulations, we investigate the effect of shear-induced particle diffusion on the transfer of heat across suspensions. The influence of particle size, particle volume fraction and applied shear are examined. By applying a heat pulse to the inner copper wall of a Couette cell and analysing its transient temperature decay, the effective thermal diffusivity of the suspension, α, is obtained. Using index matching and laser-induced fluorescence imaging, we measured individual particle trajectories and calculated their diffusion coefficients. Simulations that combined a lattice Boltzmann technique to solve for the flow and a passive Brownian tracer algorithm to solve for the transfer of heat are in very good agreement with experiments. Fluctuations induced {{by the presence of}} particles within the fluid cause a significant enhancement (> 200 %) of the suspension transport properties. The effective thermal diffusivity was found to be linear with respect to both the Péclet number (Pe = ˙ γ d 2 /α 0 100) and the solid volume fraction (φ 40 %), leading to a simple correlation α/α 0 = 1 + βφPe where β = 0. 046 and α 0 is the thermal diffusivity of the suspension at rest. In our Couette cell, the enhancement was found to be optimum for a volume fraction, φ ≈ 40 %, above which, due to steric effects, both the particle diffusion motion and of the effective thermal diffusion dramatically decrease. No such correlation was found between the average particle rotation and the thermal diffusivity of the suspension, suggesting that the driving mechanism for enhanced transport is the translational particle diffusivity.

All alloys have been studied as bulk wave soldering bars, as-received solder balls and solder joints. Ball Grid Array (BGA) solder joints in a typical electronic configuration were manufactured in-house using both Cu and Pd-Ag metallizations. Microstructural characterisation of all configurations used various types of optical and electron microscopy and showed that the solder pad metallization type {{played a major role in}} intermetallic compound (IMC) formation. There were comparatively fine and coarse-grained microstructures in both as-received solder balls and BGA solder joints depending on ball diameter. Nanoindentation creep measurements in the stress range 20 - 500 MPa showed that grain boundary sliding occurred together with dislocation glide and dislocation climb in the low temperature (25 - 50 °C) and high temperature (100 - 150 °C) regimes respectively. Smaller grain sizes (New elevated temperature mechanical tests were developed using the nanoindentation platform to enable testing of entire solder joints in shear and compression, with stresses in the 1 E- 2 - 3 MPa range, more relevant to in-service conditions than those in nanoindentation. Meso-scale spherical indentation creep behaviour in compression on as-reflowed solder balls showed good agreement with that obtained by conventional nanoindentation.

40|$|Pile {{installation}} is a complicated, {{energy intensive}} process where codes and regulatory standards provide some guidance, but little is understood about coupling and transmission of pile driving energy into {{and through the}} ground in the form of vibrations. These vibrations can cause direct structural damage and damage due to settlement of granular soils. This thesis presents results that give insight to concepts that are still in question concerning pile driving induced vibrations using impact hammers. These results are the outcome of an innovative research comprised of three components: (1) full-scale ground monitoring during impact driving of H-piles in the field, (2) small scale pile driving testing in a controlled laboratory environment and (3) numerical analysis of the impact pile driving process using 3 D finite element analysis. Field pile driving vibration data were collected from five project sites. The mechanisms of energy propagation during impact pile driving were evaluated by installing sensors in the ground, starting very close from the pile (0. 5 ft) and moving away at different radial distances and depths, generating the first data set of its kind. Analysis of the data reinforces the hypothesis of the wave propagation field generated by impact driven piles. Body waves radiate from the pile tip in a <b>spherical</b> wave front. <b>Shear</b> waves propagate outwards from the pile shaft in a cylindrical wave front. The shaft transfer starts only after the pile tip passes below and observation point (sensor). The Rayleigh wave development reported by various researchers is not verified. Attenuation of the peak particle velocity and increase of the shear wave velocity at increasing distances from the pile is also confirmed. A widely used attenuation formula (Bornitz equation) was fitted to the recorded measurements and was found to be a good model to describe the energy degradation through the soil when impact driven piles are used as a source. The attenuation coefficients are in agreement with earlier documented findings. A process to evaluate the potential for a granular soil to undergo shakedown settlement is presented based on the field measurements from the tested sites. This concept can serve as a first guide for identifying potentially troublesome sites with similar site conditions. A decrease of particle velocity and an increase of shear wave velocity with increasing distances from the pile is also verified. Reduced-scale physical experiments of pile driving were conducted in the laboratory. The controlled environment of a homogeneous and properly characterized soil profile allowed for investigation of the mechanisms of energy transfer from the pile to soil without the complexities encountered in the field. The generated wave field follows the pattern found for field testing measurements. The contribution from shear waves is not “seen” by the installed sensors until the pile tip reaches their elevation. These trends substantiate the existence of two wave fields, spherical and cylindrical, generated from a linear source as the pile, a behavior also observed in the field. The pile driving induced vibration field was modeled using a 3 D finite element dynamic analysis. It is clearly shown that a cylindrical wave front emanates from the shaft and a spherical wave front radiates from the pile tip. Preliminary results of calculated ground motions in the very close proximity of the pile showed good agreement with recorded ground motions in the laboratory...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{have focused}} on the jamming {{properties}} of systems composed of semi- 2 D elliptical shaped particles. In order to study these systems, we have performed three types of experiments: Couette shear, biaxial isotropic compression, and biaxial pure shear. In each experimental scheme, we take data for both systems of ellipses an bi-disperse disks, in order to probe the effect of broken spherical symmetry at the particle scale, on the global behavior. We use two synchronized cameras to capture the flow of particles and the local stress at the same time. In Couette experiments, we study the rheological properties, as well as the stress fluctuations for very large strains (up to 20 revolutions of the inner wheel). The system is sheared for densities below the isotropic jamming point (point J). From these studies we learn that over a small range of packing fractions, (0. 85 ≤ϕ≤ 0. 86), systems of ellipses demonstrate exceptionally slow dynamical evolution when they are sheared. For fixed density, and starting from an essentially unstressed state, the application of shear strain leads to first a growth of average particle displacements in the system through a Reynolds dilatancy effect, and then for very large strains, a steady decrease in particle displacements. In an intermediate range of shear strains, the system exists in effectively meta-stable states {{for a very long time}} before relaxing to an unjammed state, in which the flow of particles stops completely, and the stress fluctuations drop to zero. The strain scale for this relaxation depends on the global packing fraction. We characterize this slow dynamics by measuring the evolution of mean velocity, density, and orientational order throughout the experiments. In a similar set of experiments performed on disks, slow relaxation was observed as well. However, the increasing average displacement build-up before relaxation, which was observed in ellipses, did not occur for disks. This suggests that the slow relaxation towards an unjammed state in ellipses is associated with the possibility of small and slow changes in their orientations, which then allow a more efficient packing. In order to study the stress fluctuations, we implement photoelastic properties of the particles. We are able to track the g^ 2 (a measure of local stress) of each particle throughout the entire experiment. Unlike disks, the power spectra of g^ 2, P(ω), is not rate invariant for ellipses. In other words, all curves of R P(ω) vs. ω / R (where R is the shear rate) with different values of R, collapse to a single curve for disks, but not for ellipses. The rate invariance of spectra was previously studied for <b>sheared</b> <b>spherical</b> glass beads and semi- 2 D pentagonal particles. This is the first experimental work in which the fluctuations of granular systems composed of elongated particles is addressed. We have also studied the formation and destruction of stress avalanches during Couette shear in both systems of disks and ellipses. In particular, we introduce measures which characterize the size and shape of stress avalanches. Analysis of these measures shows that the build-up and release of stress in both systems of disks and ellipses have similar distributions which indicates that the deformation of particles in a Couette cell does not resemble stick-slip behavior. We also find that the build-up and release of stress is faster is larger avalanches. Cyclic isotropic compression is performed on semi- 2 D systems of bi-disperse disks and identical ellipses with aspect ratio 2, which are composed of photoelastic particles. In each compression cycle, the system is compressed with a total strain of 1. 6 % and then expanded to the initial state. After completion of each half cycle, the system is allowed to relax, then imaged by two synchronized cameras. The packing fraction, ϕ, of compressed states are chosen above the isotopic jamming point (point J). In both systems of disks and ellipses, we observed relaxation of global stress over long compression cycles. We find that the global stress drops with a power law over time (σ∼ C t^-A). The exponent of decay, A, drops linearly with increasing ϕ, and hits zero at ϕ≃ 0. 89 for disks, and ϕ≃ 0. 93 for ellipses. Above these packing fractions, the system is stable with respect to its global stress. In order to understand the origin of this slow stress dilation, we have studied the structural changes of the system, including Falk-Langer measures of affine and non-affine deformations, as well as average contact per particle.

40|$|Concentrated {{suspensions}} of detergent powder solids in {{a liquid}} nonionic surfactant are considered for practical application as liquid detergent products. If no precautions are taken, upon storage the viscosity of such suspensions increases and the pourability drops because the suspensions are colloidally unstable. It {{has been found}} that after the addition of a small amount of dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid (DoBS-acid or HDoBS) good pourability is maintained on storage. All the phenomena observed with such suspensions suggest that the addition of DoBS-acid reduces coagulation and improves colloidal stability. It was hypothesized that the colloidal stability obtained is of an electrostatic nature. In a liquid non-aqueous medium this is unexpected. A study of the mechanism of stabilization is described in this thesis. After a general introduction to the topic in Chapter 1, in Chapter 2 we discuss the character of the interactions which play a role in nonionic suspensions. The used nonionics are condensates of long chain alcohols and 3 to 9 alkylene oxide units. The dispersed solids are sodium salts as are usually present in current detergent powders, or oxides. They are aggregates or agglomerates of smaller crystalline primary particles and consist of irregular spheroids. The solids, the liquid nonionics and the anionic acid have been characterized with respect to a number of properties, including the molecular and crystalline structure, specific density, specific surface area, porosity, axial ratio and water content. The refractive indices and dielectric constants of the liquids and solids are also measured. Elemental analysis of the supernatants of our suspensions is carried out by Atomic Absorption, by Plasma Emission and by X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Since analysis of the supernatants indicated only very limited dissolution of the solids, it is concluded that the suspensions are lyophobic. It is demonstrated that, when DoBS- acid is added to a suspension of sodium salts in nonionic, it is converted quantitatively into anionic NaDoBS. Sedimentation rates, sediment volumes and viscosities are important physical characteristics of concentrated nonionic suspensions; they reflect the interactions between the suspended particles. The interactions follow the DLVO-theory, meaning that they are governed by the balance between attractive and repulsive or 'stabilizing' forces. The literature on van der Waals attraction (energy and forces) between particles in suspension is discussed in Chapter 3. It shows that for particles in the micron-size range, geometrical parameters (differences in particle size, interparticle distance), retardation and surface roughness are of more importance than in colloidal systems, having smaller particles. This means that the van der Waals bonding energy obtained on approach is larger, but, as a function of increasing interparticle distances, it decays more rapidly. In the van der Waals attraction, material properties are reflected in the Hamaker constant. Hamaker constants for the inorganic crystalline solids considered in this study are not available in the literature. Therefore it was necessary to evaluate them theoretically. Two approaches have been applied, a macroscopic theory and a microscopic theory. In a comparison they gave identical results within a few tens of percent. For the crystalline detergent solids the constants have been evaluated from their dielectric constants and refractive indices. The results showed the Hamaker constants for the detergent solids (except activated Zeolite 4 A) to exceed those of the nonionics, but to be lower than those of the metal oxides. The differences between the constants of crystalline detergent solids and those of nonionics are relatively small, implying that suspensions of detergent solid particles in nonionics can be made to relatively high volume fractions and can be stabilized easily. In Chapter 4 the electrostatic theory for interactions of particle pairs in suspension is evaluated for its applicability in non-aqueous media, using models of plates and spheres. For both models the conclusion is that, for the calculation of the repulsive energies and forces, approximated equations can be used. They result in repulsive energies, pressures and forces, which are in good agreement with those of exact computations at distances> 10 nm, but underestimate the repulsions at shorter distances. DLVO energy and force curves have been constructed and demonstrate the dependence of the repulsion on five parameters that govern the behaviour, viz. the dielectric constant, the ionic strength, the electric surface potential, the Hamaker constant and the particle size. For our suspensions with surface potentials ≥ 20 mV, significant repulsions already develop at distances between 2 and 40 nm. The theoretical repulsions are much higher than the van der Waals attractions and cause much larger repulsive barriers than those usually reported for non- polar, nonaqueous media. They are expected {{to play a role in}} the colloidal stabilization of nonionic suspensions and to influence the resistance against coagulation under pressures at the bottom of sediments. Secondary minima are only a few kT at most and coagulation is only expected at the protrusion points of contact and at relatively high ionic strengths. Ionic strengths in HDoBS-stabilized suspensions in the nonionics Plurafac LFRA 30 and Imbentin C 91 / 35 are evaluated from the conductivity in the supernatants and from their respective limiting molar conductivities. The methodology is described in Chapter 5. It was found that in both nonionics the limiting molar conductivity was lower than predicted from the values in water assuming Walden's rule applies. The results indicate that solvation interactions of Na +and DoBS -ions in nonionics are stronger than in water and stronger in Imbentin than in Plurafac. In Chapter 6 the results of the electric and dielectric measurements have been given. It is shown that the dielectric constant of nonionic is increased by HDoBS. Taking this increase into account, the ionic strengths found can be satisfactorily explained from theory. Only at high HDoBS concentration and relatively high dielectric constants are the ion concentrations lower than theoretically predicted, a feature that could be due to the formation of 'molecular associates'. From the limiting conductivities, at HDoBS concentrations between 10 and 150 mM, the ionic strengths have been found to range from 0. 05 to 4 mM in Plurafac and from 0. 08 to 30 mM in Imbentin. These results demonstrate a weak dissociation of the NaDoBS electrolyte. However, the ionic strengths obtained are considerably larger than those in supernatants of unstable suspensions and are higher than ever reported in the 'non-polar' hydrocarbon media, commonly considered in non-aqueous studies. Liquid nonionic media have a dielectric constant between 5 and 12 and are denoted 'low-polar'. At these ionic strengths, and considering the enhancement of the dielectric constant by HDoBS, in the HDoBS concentration regime between 0. 5 and 150 mM, Debye lengths range from 33 to I nm in Plurafac and from 13 to 1 nm in Imbentin, i. e. in the same range as in aqueous media. Electrokinetic (ζ-) potentials of particles of detergent solids suspended in nonionics, given in Chapter 6, are found to be a function of the HDoBS concentration. The surface potentials tend to level off at HDoBS concentrations as low as 0. 5 % w/w (15 mM dm - 3 ), to a maximum value ranging from + 25 to + 70 mV, depending on the nature of the solid and the nonionic liquid. Addition of water or of a crown-complexant (15 -Crown- 5), reduces the ζ-potential. The formation of positive surface charges can be explained from the dissociation of adsorbed HDoBS. Mechanical properties of concentrated non-aqueous suspensions are discussed in Chapter 7, including their relation to the electrostatic repulsion. Rheology is used to monitor the properties under dynamic conditions. The consistency, which quantifies the particle interactions and shear thinning index was derived from the Sisko model. Addition of HDoBS was found to have little or no influence on the high shear rate viscosity of nonionic suspensions. This viscosity is governed by hydrodynamic interactions, which are, in turn, determined by the viscosity of the nonionic phase, the volume fraction and the temperature. The nature of the solid also has an influence on the 'infinite shear' viscosity, probably due to variations in protrusion size, causing their effective volumes to be larger than the actual volume. Measurements of the intrinsic viscosity of sodium tripolyphosphate (STP) indicated that the particles of this substance are almost <b>spherical.</b> Low <b>shear</b> rate viscosities monitor effects of interparticle interactions. The consistency was found to be inversely proportional to the particle volume. Addition of HDoBS reduces the consistency. As with the ~-potentials, the main effect is already obtained from 0. 5 % w/w HDoBS. In this respect the behaviour of the viscosity is correlated with that of the ~-potential of the particles. It is further found that the drop in the 'normalized' consistency has a direct relation to the electrostatic force. These results support the conclusion that the nature of the obtained stabilization is electrostatic. The correlation of the viscosity with the Péclet number further supports this conclusion. It shows that under shear HDoBS-stabilized systems can be considered as hard-sphere suspensions. Creep compliance measurements of suspensions of STP in Plurafac at high volume fractions demonstrated that at low shear stresses the interactions are completely elastic. Under those conditions, relaxation of the stress leads to almost complete recovery. The shear moduli derived from creep compliance, drop less steeply as a function of the volume fraction than predicted from the electrostatic repulsive barrier. It is possible that this difference is a result of secondary minimum coagulation by the particle protrusions. In static sediments the volume fractions can be measured as a function of height by γ-ray absorption. Measurements of γ-ray absorption shows that the particle concentration from top to bottom in a stable sediment shows a concentration gradient. For HDoBS-stabilized suspensions this gradient is more continuous, whereas in unstable suspensions, due to coagulation, it is very irregular. From these results the relations between the static pressure or the network modulus and the volume fraction are derived. Pressures show an exponential relation with the interparticle distances. With low levels of DoBS-acid the interparticle distances are larger than for high concentrations of HDoBS. These results are in agreement with the dependency predicted by electrostatic repulsion, although the experimental pressure drop as a function of distance is much smoother than that theoretically predicted. The experimental network moduli derived from the pressure-volume fraction relation also drop much more slowly than theoretically predicted. This may again be a result of secondary minimum coagulation occurring by the protrusions. The overall conclusion is that the suspensions under consideration are electrostatically stabilized with DoBS-acid as the charge-determining electrolyte...|$|R
