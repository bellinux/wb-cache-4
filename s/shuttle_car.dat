50|$|Number of <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> loads {{is defined}} as the total number of fully loaded shuttle cars that were loaded at the {{continuous}} miner and subsequently tipped at the feeder breaker.Average <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> load time refers to the average time in seconds that was necessary to load a <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> to its maximum coal-carrying capacity.Average <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> change time refers to the average time in seconds that was necessary for an unloaded <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> to be repositioned behind the continuous miner after the previously loaded <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> trammed away from the machine towards the tipping point.Conveyor on time refers to the total time in minutes that the flight chain conveyor on the continuous miner was running.Cutter ON - Conveyor OFF - bunker operation min- bunker operation refers to the total time in minutes that ONLY the cutterhead was running and coal was being stored on the spade.Shuttle car away time refers to the total time in minutes that was utilised by a loaded <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> to travel from the continuous miner to the feeder breaker, tip the loaded coal and travel back to the continuous miner to be loaded again.Cutter operation time refers to the total time in minutes that the cutterhead was running.Relocation time refers to the total time in minutes that was utilised in order to relocate a continuous miner to a different heading after the maximum allowable unsupported length of the previously cut heading was reached.Utilisation of the modified cutting cycle has improved the general consistency of the production machines in achieving the target values of the key performance indicators. This is confirmed by means of continuous production reporting that monitors and documents the key performance indicators on a shift basis. The following table shows an example of a typical summary of key performance indicators and the actual numbers achieved. It is illustrative of the success with which the bi-directional cutting cycle is being run at a South African coal mine.|$|E

5000|$|In {{conjunction}} with the continuous improvement in the Fischer-Tropsch process and catalyst, significant developments were also made in mining technology. Coal mining at Sasol {{from the early days}} has been characterised by innovation. Sasol Mining mainly utilises the Room and pillar method of mining with a continuous miner. Sasol successfully used the longwall mining method from 1967 to 1987. Today Sasol is one of the leaders in coal mining technology and was the first to develop in-seam drilling from surface using a directional drilling methodology. This has been developed into an effective exploration tool. [...] Working with Fifth Dimension, Sasol developed a virtual reality technology to help train continuous miner operators in a 3D environment in which various scenarios can be simulated including sound, dust and other signs of movement. This has recently been expanded to include <b>shuttle</b> <b>car,</b> roofbolting and load-haul dumper simulators.|$|E
5000|$|Today, the U.S. Department of Labor Mine Safety and Health Administration {{mentions}} that users of heavy equipment {{can benefit from}} an analogous accessory: In the 1950s, cars were often equipped with curb feelers ...Using a piece of 48 inch conveyor belt, 4 to 5 feet long by 4 to 6 inches wide {{and a couple of}} pieces of angle iron, you can make a pinch-point feeler, a warning device for the corners of a continuous miner. This will give a warning nudge to anyone in the danger area, giving him or her about a two-foot running start to stop the machine or to yell at the operator to stop. The belting is stiff enough to hold its shape but flexible enough to give if it runs into a miner or vice versa. The flexibility also allows this [...] "curb feeler" [...] to drag against the rib or be smacked by a <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> with little or no damage. A little spray from a can of reflective paint will make the belt a visual warning device as well. One or two on each corner will help or put as many as you want.|$|E
30|$|Research on the CAC {{is being}} {{expanded}} to include a CAC for <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> operators to provide respiratory protection from respirable coal mine dust. Ambient mine air is filtered and blown over the operator through a plenum built into the <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> canopy. A {{new version of the}} CAC, specifically designed for the <b>shuttle</b> <b>car,</b> has been developed under a NIOSH contract by Marshall University and J.H. Fletcher [contract # 200 - 2015 - 63485], and is based upon NIOSH design recommendations. NIOSH completed the required laboratory testing of the <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> CAC to determine its ability to reduce the <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> operatorsâ€™ respirable coal dust exposure. This paper details results of testing the <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> CAC in 0.61 Â m/s (120 fpm), 2.0 Â m/s (400 fpm), and 4.3 Â m/s (850 fpm) ventilation airflows. Since results with 4.3 Â m/s (850 fpm) ventilation airflows were not satisfactory additional tests with modifications to the location and design of the CAC were conducted. Modifications included moving the CAC 22.86 Â cm (9 in.) forward of operator location and adding a 5.08 Â cm (2 in.) spoiler. These modifications provided satisfactory results, thus showing that a <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> CAC can be a viable dust control device for the protection of <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> operators to coal mine respirable dust.|$|E

30|$|These {{laboratory}} {{tests showed that}} the canopy air curtain for the <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> is successful at reducing respirable coal mine dust exposure at low ventilation velocities. Redesign of the CAC to shift it forward 22.9 Â cm (9 in.) with a spoiler and flush mount it onto the <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> roof should successfully protect the <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> operator from respirable coal mine dust as seen by the results from these tests. Other options to improve the dust control efficiency of the CAC could be evaluated, such as increasing the airflow to the CAC and/or enlarging {{the size of the}} CAC to have a single CAC over the entire canopy. But, these enhancements are probably not necessary for improving dust control efficiency. The laboratory testing on the <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> CAC demonstrates that it can successfully protect the <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> operator by reducing exposure to coal mine respirable dust. A field test is being planned to test the CAC at a mine site that uses blowing face ventilation.|$|E

30|$|These {{exposures}} occur {{while the}} <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> operator is operating downwind of the continuous miner, {{waiting to be}} loaded with coal.

30|$|Canopy {{air curtain}} (CAC) {{technology}} has been developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for use on continuous miners and subsequently roof bolting machines in underground coal mines to protect operators of these machines from overexposure to respirable coal mine dust. The next logical progression {{is to develop a}} CAC for shuttle cars to protect operators from the same overexposures. NIOSH awarded a contract to Marshall University and J.H. Fletcher to develop the <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> CAC. NIOSH conducted laboratory testing to determine the dust control efficiency of the <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> CAC. Testing was conducted on two different cab configurations: a center drive similar to that on a Joy 10 SC 32 AA cab model and an end drive similar to that on a Joy 10 SC 32 AB cab model. Three different ventilation velocities were testedâ€” 0.61, 2.0, 4.3 Â m/s (120, 400, and 850 fpm). The lowest, 0.61 Â m/s (120 fpm), represented the ventilation velocity encountered during loading by the continuous miner, while the 4.3 Â m/s (850 fpm) velocity represented ventilation velocity airflow over the <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> while tramming against ventilation airflow. Test results showed an average of the dust control efficiencies ranging from 74 to 83 % for 0.61 Â m/s (120 fpm), 39 %â€“ 43 % for 2.0 Â m/s (400 fpm), and 6 %â€“ 16 % for 4.3 Â m/s (850 fpm). Incorporating an airflow spoiler to the <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> CAC design and placing the CAC so that it is located 22.86 Â cm (9 Â in.) forward of the operator improved the dust control efficiency to 51 %â€“ 55 % for 4.3 Â m/s (850 fpm) with minimal impact on dust control efficiencies for lower ventilation velocities. These laboratory tests demonstrate that the newly developed <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> CAC has the potential to successfully protect <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> operators from coal mine respirable dust overexposures.|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{with the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{conducted}} a systematic study to evaluate seat designs on low- and mid-coal-seam shuttle cars. The {{purpose was to}} gather additional data to support earlier findings that NIOSH seats, with unique viscoelastic foam padding, are indeed improved designs for coal mine shuttle cars. This study included a larger sample of <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> operators than a prior NIOSH investigation. Eight <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> operators participated in evaluating seat designs {{on the basis of}} perceived levels of vehicle jarring/jolting and discomfort. Researchers then compared the operators' perceptions with field-measured levels of vehicle jarring/jolting. Seven seat designs were evaluated on low- and mid-coal-seam shuttle cars during production operations at two underground coal mines in southern West Virginia. These seat designs comprised the one already in use on each vehicle and five NIOSH designs. Experimental data were collected using accelerometers, signal conditioning amplifiers, and filters connected to a data recorder, whereas subjective data were gathered via a visual analog scale (VAS) and a questionnaire. Field trials included shuttle cars operating under full and no-load conditions. VAS responses indicated that NIOSH-designed seats performed better relative to comfort and isolation from vehicle jarring/jolting than the existing seats used in the shuttle cars. Both mid- and low-coal-seam <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> operators, during no-load and full-load conditions, rated lower levels of jarring/jolting with the NIOSH seat design. Questionnaire responses indicated that <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> operators rated NIOSH seat designs as more comfortable. Vehicle operators most frequently suggested the addition of armrests as a way to improve the seats on the mid-seam <b>shuttle</b> <b>car.</b> The quantitative levels of vehicle jarring/jolting for the no-load condition (more severe condition for vehicle operation) showed that NIOSH seats for the mid-coal-seam <b>shuttle</b> <b>car</b> performed better than the existing seat in terms of peak acceleration and crest factor. Similarly, for the low-coal-seam <b>shuttle</b> <b>car,</b> NIOSH seats performed better than the existing seat in terms of peak acceleration, root-mean-square (RMS) acceleration, and crest factor. This research will provide the mining industry with better seat designs for isolating operators from vehicle jarring/jolting.
