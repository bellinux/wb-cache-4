5000|$|In 1906 Chandler {{handed over}} {{publication}} of Truth to Reginald Louis Solomon (1877-1939), retaining editorship, then in September 1906 {{went through a}} <b>sham</b> <b>sale</b> of the business to A. Hall, perhaps intending to boost its value {{in the event of}} a future sale. Hall sold the business to Solomon, in another paper transaction. Chandler then sued Solomon, who with Amos had started removing machinery, for trespass, but lost the case. In 1907 Solomon was convicted of publishing an [...] "obscene libel", for the 20 May article in the [...] "Darkest Adelaide" [...] column. Adelaide Truth ceased publication about this time; though it was rumoured that John Norton was interested in starting a South Australian edition of his publication.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, Rothko and his {{financial}} advisor, Bernard Reis, {{had created a}} foundation, intended to fund [...] "research and education", that would receive the bulk of Rothko's work following his death. Reis later sold the paintings to the Marlborough Gallery, at substantially reduced values, and then split the profits from sales with Gallery representatives. In 1971, Rothko's children {{filed a lawsuit against}} Reis, Morton Levine, and Theodore Stamos, the executors of his estate, over the <b>sham</b> <b>sales.</b> The lawsuit continued for more than 10 years, and became known as the Rothko Case. In 1975, the defendants were found liable for negligence and conflict of interest, were removed as executors of the Rothko estate by court order, and, along with Marlborough Gallery, were required to pay a $9.2 million damages judgment to the estate. This amount represents {{only a small fraction of}} the eventual vast financial value, since achieved, by numerous Rothko works produced in his lifetime.|$|R
40|$|Concepts such {{as money}} and wealth in general changed greatly in the Middle Ages. On {{the one hand}} the medieval world was {{permeated}} with the simple ideas of the barbarians, who plainly identified wealth with happiness and success. Yet {{on the other hand}} ideas began to appear and spread which were drawn from the legacy of antiquity and which judged money according to the positive and negative effect it had on society. Medieval culture was multifaceted and varied greatly from territory to territory. In this culture money could be seen on several levels. One of the most comprehensive looks at money in the culture of the Middle Ages was given by Ryszard Kiersnowski, whose work became an inspiration for later researchers. Christianity had a positive relationship towards money, and the first Christians accepted it as a normal part of life. Money at that time served as a kind of medium, the images on which disseminated a substantial ideology in society, which succumbed to the power of these images. Therefore, first of all we need to go into the iconography of medieval coins, which can be divided up into two groups – the ecclesiastical and the secular, which in many cases obviously overlap and supplement one another (F. Friedensburg). The Church’s mission to spread harmony in the Middle Ages evidently created the idea that money could become a means to allow the Christian to help the poor and powerless. This tendency can also be seen in the pictures on the coins; the coin imagery, by showing good deeds, was supposed to educate people to use the money to perform good deeds themselves. This began with the establishment of pawn shops, which helped towndwellers out of financial difficulties. The first municipal – i. e. public – pawn shop was apparently set up in Perugia in 1462 (Monte dei Poveri). In Papal Rome, after approval had been granted by the Pope in 1515, this {{led to the creation of}} an institution – Monte di Pieta, which was a precursor to the people’s banking institutions that would come later. Some pawn shops did not charge any interest, but most took the opportunity to do so. Clearly we should also point out that these charitable institutions later became standard commercial financial institutions. In the Middle Ages money-lending with interest was widespread. Usury, however, was officially prohibited and it was hard to get around this ban. Yet the effort to satisfy the surviving kin of money-lenders was so powerful that it gave rise to teaching about purgatory. The souls of money-lenders in purgatory could be helped if their surviving family members devoted themselves to pious deeds. According to J. Le Goff, teaching about purgatory could have been of great significance, as the fact that purgatory showed mercy even to money-lenders was one factor in the rise of capitalism. Purgatory became a form of hope for certain types of sinners who could not otherwise redeem themselves of their sins, but also for following certain professions which formerly led to damnation. Obviously teaching about purgatory was a somewhat uncertain course of action and when theological speculations about how to weaken the ban on usury failed, people looked for other ways to circumvent the prohibition. Sometimes a loan was disguised as a gift, to which the debtor responded with a gift that was worth more than the sum originally loaned. Other ways of getting round the ban involved a variety of <b>sham</b> purchases and <b>sales.</b> In the 15 th century people thought it necessary to differentiate between illegitimate loans and “legitimate” loans; cases were generally judged according to the amount of interest. Opinions evidently differed, and eventually diet decrees set the legal rate of interest. In 1484 the Bohemian diet (Landtag) set the maximum permissible interest rate at 10 percent, which was later reduced to 6 percent. The church authorities protested against this, but with no great success. It is interesting to observe opinions concerning money-lending changed in the Unity of the Brethren. This began with the opinions of Petr Chelčický, which were in line with his radically anti-usury view of society. Later, however, the Unity of the Brethren took a less harsh stance on the issue. Medieval man was accompanied by money from the cradle, as a christening gift, to the grave, as the obol of the dead. From the first instance to the latter he used coins every day of his life, often without noticing how the money was actually using him...|$|R
