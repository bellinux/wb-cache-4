Since, by definition, these entities are absent from the speech signal, it is of interest that language learners still can come to have information about them. As this phenomenon could not have resulted from sufficient prior experience, it suggests the role of universal grammar.|$|E

Exemplar then integrates statistical analysis tools for doing common data processing such as data normalization, but also for doing exploratory analysis such as logistic regression, ANOVA and genetic algorithms for model building. The results of these analysis can lead to proper patient profiling for personalized medicine, and {{can mean the difference between}} success or failure for new or existing drugs.|$|E

Further, the ANSM committee remarked that {{the gap between the}} 20 mg and 50 mg dose cohorts, in effect, skipped a dose based on extrapolation from the single dose part of the study, and that the progression to 50 mg was too large a jump. On reviewing the <b>subject</b> <b>data</b> from the trial itself, the committee noted that BIA 10-2474 showed non-linear pharmacokinetics at doses between 40-100 mg (that is, the molecule appeared to be accumulating at higher doses) and that most likely the elimination mechanism had become saturated. Thus dosing at 50 mg daily was - each day - 40 times more than required to achieve complete inhibition, and in practice this dose level resulted in accumulation.|$|E
