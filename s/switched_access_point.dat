40|$|In future {{wireless}} access networks, connectivity to wired infrastructure {{will be provided}} through multiple <b>access</b> <b>points</b> with possibly different capabilities and utilization. The demand for increased network performance requires the ability to predict the best overall performance of those <b>access</b> <b>points</b> and to <b>switch</b> <b>access</b> <b>point</b> when the performance changes. Then there is the demand for mobility between networks with maintained connectivity which requires the ability to switch the point of attachment. We propose Multihomed Mobile IP, enabling performance discovery at the networks layer and the capability to decide what AP to use.

40|$|This report {{presents}} our on-going {{work on a}} {{new system}} {{designed to provide a}} continuous network connectivity to communicating devices located on-board a vehicle moving at ”high speed” with a predictable trajectory such as trains, subways or buses. The devices on-board the vehicle form a sub-network called the ”in-motion network”. This system we propose is composed of two parts. The mobile part, called Spiderman Device (SD), installed {{on the roof of the}} vehicle, and the fixed part is composed of multiples <b>access</b> <b>points,</b> called Wireless <b>Switch</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Points</b> (WS APs), installed along the predictable route of the vehicle.

This dual-radio architecture allows to minimize or even hide the handover effects, achieving a seamless continuous data-link connection at high speeds, up-to 150 Km/h and possibly more.

40|$|Wireless {{networks}} are constantly increasing in size, {{both in the}} number of users {{as well as in the}} amount of data being transmitted through them. In an effort to provide users with better working conditions we constantly increase the number of <b>access</b> <b>points</b> within a network. These <b>access</b> <b>points</b> form the basis of a wireless network, their common feature being the same network name. Physically they are placed at various locations, and in order to avoid mutual interference, they operate on different channels. The goal is to ensure the highest quality of network operation, regardless of movement of the user within the network's coverage area. Roaming is the process which connects a user with closer <b>access</b> <b>points</b> in an automated way. In order to choose a new (better) <b>access</b> <b>point,</b> the network client must be familiar with its neighborhood, which is explored by searching. A suspension of the users data stream is required while the network client is searching through different channels. Data flow is also interrupted during the roaming, because the processes of association and authentication are being performed. In the thesis I presented the operation of an extended wireless network and properties of <b>access</b> <b>points</b> and clients related to <b>switching</b> <b>access</b> <b>points,</b> in particular the processes of searching and roaming. I also presented the Eduroam network as well as the network hardware and software that I used for measurements, including the testing parameters. Measurements in different configurations were made in a test network and the Eduroam network. The results show that the use of roaming in its simplest form is not appropriate for services requiring minimal interruptions of data flows. Thus, VoIP services that can tolerate interruptions of up to 50 ms, cannot be used in combination with roaming. Also provided are some ideas for certain improvements to shorten the search and roaming processes. ...|$|R

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of vehicle-based mobile devices, vehicular networks are becoming an essential part of wireless heterogeneous networks. Therefore, vehicular networks have been widely studied in recent years. Because of limited transmission range of wireless antennas, mobile vehicles should also <b>switch</b> their <b>access</b> <b>points</b> to maintain the connections as conventional mobile nodes. Considering the inherent characteristics of vehicular networks such as dynamic topology and high speed, {{the question of how to}} implement handoff protocol under real-time scenarios is very important. IEEE 802. 11 p protocol is designed for vehicular networks for the long distance transmission. To reduce handoff latency for 802. 11 p protocol, the authentication phase is waived during the handoff. However, security is also very important for wireless communications, and authentication can forbid access from malicious nodes and prevent wireless communications from potential attacks. Thus, in this paper, a lightweight authentication scheme is introduced to balance the security requirements and the handoff performance for 802. 11 p vehicular networks. In our scheme, the <b>access</b> <b>points</b> are divided into different trust groups, and the authentication process is completed in a group-based method. Once a vehicle is authenticated by an <b>access</b> <b>point</b> group, during the handoff within the same group, few extra authentication operations are needed. As a result, there is no extra overhead introduced to the authentication servers. Simulation results demonstrate that our authentication scheme only introduces small handoff latency and it is ideal for vehicular networks...|$|R
