5|$|Bennett {{declined}} the offer to be Dole's running mate but suggested Kemp, a man described as Dole's antagonist. On August 16, 1996, the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential , running alongside former <b>Senator</b> <b>Dole.</b> Kemp {{was seen as}} a means to attract conservative and libertarian-minded voters like those of tough nomination-challengers Forbes and Pat Buchanan. Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack, John McCain, and Carroll Campbell, and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Dole's senior advisors. Dole had had a long history of representing the budget-balancing faction of the Party, while Kemp had had a long history of representing the tax-cutting advocates, and Kemp's tax-cutting fiscal track record was seen as the perfect fit for the ticket. When Kemp became Dole's running mate in 1996, they appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 19, 1996 issue of Time magazine, but the pair barely edged out a story on the reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on Mars, which was so close to being the cover story that Time inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was.|$|E

Dole told Congress regarding the new provisions, “I am confident that this bill eliminates the greedy and feeds the needy.” The law was intended to strengthen the agricultural economy and provide improved levels of nutrition among low-income households; however, the practical purpose was to bring the pilot FSP under congressional control and to enact the regulations into law.|$|E

He was physically attacked though uninjured on the Senate floor by a representative of organized labor. In a tumultuous session, right-to-work passed, but it was repealed two years later in 1956 in the last Long administration through the work of Victor Bussie, the newly installed president of the Louisiana AFL-CIO. Twenty years later, in 1976, right-to-work was resurrected in the second term of Governor Edwin Washington Edwards. After his Senate service, Doles returned to his banking business full-time.

It was authorized by the 2002 Farm Bill and reauthorized in 2008. Funding sources have varied since the pilot Global Food for Education program was deployed in fiscal year 2001, often combining both appropriated funds and funding from the Commodity Credit Corporation’s borrowing authority.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s, the European Economic Community (EEC) {{emerged as}} a {{competitor}} for export sales, particularly of grain. EEC export restitutions (subsidies) undercut U.S. sales, {{with the result that}} farm-state Members of Congress, led by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, pushed through new legislation authorizing broader subsidization of commercial export sales. This Export Enhancement Program (or EEP, though it was originally called [...] "BICEP" [...] by <b>Senator</b> <b>Dole)</b> was used primarily to counter EEC subsidies in important markets. Use of EEP opened the United States to criticism from less developed countries on the grounds that export subsidies undercut their own farmers by depressing global commodity prices. By the mid-1990s EEP was largely abandoned in favor of negotiating for a multilateral ban on agricultural export subsidies; it was last used, for a single sale, during the Clinton administration. With founding of the World Trade Organization in January 1995, trade-distorting domestic agricultural supports were capped in all member states and absolute import quotas were banned, but negotiations on eliminating export subsidies continue still.|$|E

40|$|Does {{international}} governance {{threaten to}} crowd out American democracy? Many public figures and scholars think so. The street theater in Seattle {{last fall and}} <b>Senator</b> <b>Dole</b> 2 ̆ 7 s effort to establish a national tribunal to review World Trade Organization (2 ̆ 2 WTO 2 ̆ 2) dispute resolution decisions both attest {{to the extent of}} the concern. As international institutions burgeon in number and significance, the residuum of authority left in our national government seems an ever diminishing domain. Extrapolating into the future, one can envision a time when the United States retains only as much sovereignty as, say, the members of the European Union or the States in our own federal system. The diminution of sovereignty brings with it a loss of democracy, as the distance between citizens and the institutions that make the most meaningful decisions grows greater. I take this concern seriously but believe its popular formulation is too simplistic and somewhat misplaced. International governance entails not only the formal institutions and explicit agreements that generate what I have called the 2 ̆ 2 new international law. 2 ̆ 2 It also embraces a system of formulating and imposing norms on state and individual behavior that operates outside of any publicly accountable institution. A debate recently has arisen in the United States over the legitimacy of customary international law, with fierce arguments on each side. One dimension of this debate is the tension between American democracy and the adoption of customary norms through the courts...|$|E
