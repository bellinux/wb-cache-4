In 1986, Waldheim {{said that he had}} served only as an interpreter and a clerk and had no knowledge either of reprisals against local Serb civilians or of massacres in neighboring provinces of Yugoslavia. He said that he had known {{about some of the things}} that had happened, and had been horrified, but could not <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> he could have done.|$|E
25|$|Despite the price, the 1990s {{became an}} era of {{experimentation}} to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> growth hormone could help. The medical literature of the decade contains hundreds of reports of small trials of GH use in nearly every type of growth failure and shortness imaginable. In most cases, the growth responses were modest. For conditions with a large enough potential market, more rigorous trials were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies that were making growth hormone to achieve approval to market for those specific indications. Turner syndrome and chronic renal failure were {{the first of these}} “nonGH-deficient causes of shortness” to receive FDA approval for GH treatment, and Prader-Willi syndrome and intrauterine growth retardation followed. Similar expansion of use occurred in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|These {{calls to}} extend {{the scope of the}} inquiry to include missing and murdered {{aboriginal}} people of all genders have met with resistance and been criticized as detracting from the current focus on the issue of missing and murdered aboriginal women. [...] Barbara Bailey, who was on the UN team that visited Canada in 2013 to investigate the violence, has said, [...] "I think to detract now would really be a tragedy. Let’s fix that problem first and then we can begin to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> is out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 8, 2013, Shady Records {{president}} and Eminem's manager Paul Rosenberg told Billboard that Eminem's eighth studio album {{would be released}} after Memorial Day, 2013 (May 27). [...] "We fully expect to be releasing a new Eminem album in 2013. He's {{been working on it}} for some time," [...] said Rosenberg. [...] "It's safe to say that it will be post-Memorial Day at some point, but we're not exactly sure when. We've got some dates locked in for him to perform live in Europe in August, so we're trying to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> lines up." [...] On March 22, 2013, during an interview with Power 106, Dr. Dre said that he was working with Eminem, and that Eminem was [...] "finishing up his project." ...|$|E

Everybody copies out their days and so can <b>see</b> <b>what</b> {{everybody}} <b>else</b> has got. I don’t understand why I feel so awkward, even ashamed. I shrink, avoid looking at people. Why? I’m not guilty of anything." [...] -Olya ...|$|R

2500|$|In September 2008, RZA {{announced}} that he had inked a deal with digital music company The Orchard to release the Wu-Tang Clan's back catalogue worldwide digitally, for the first time. In addition to forthcoming material, the Wu-Tang Clan's catalogue includes 13 previous releases that have been previously unavailable digitally, including recordings by the group as a whole, U-God, Wu-Syndicate, Killarmy, Shyheim, West Coast Killa Beez, Black Knights and others, and would be available online beginning September 23. [...] "The time is right to bring some older Wu material to the masses digitally," [...] said RZA, de facto leader of Wu-Tang Clan. [...] "Our fans have been dedicated and patient and they're hungry to hear the music that has set us apart from so many others. Hip-hop is alive in Wu Music, and with The Orchard, we've got a solid partner that understands our audience and is committed to doing all they can to help us reach the fans. I'm definitely looking forward to working with them to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> we all come up with. There's much more to come." ...|$|E

You always <b>see</b> <b>what</b> nobody <b>else</b> sees; {{it is impossible to}} satisfy you; yet you never <b>see</b> <b>what</b> is quite plain. That's your way, Dodo."

5000|$|Endemol, {{the company}} that created the Big Brother concept demanded that TV6 pay a license fee, as do the other 20 {{networks}} {{around the world that}} air versions of Big Brother. TV-6 press representative Tatiana Blinova responded that Behind the Glass {{had nothing to do with}} Big Brother and that the idea for the show came to the director 12 years ago after reading a Russian literary classic, an anti-utopian, sci-fi novel [...] "We" [...] by Yevgeny Zamyatin in which people live in glass houses so everyone can <b>see</b> <b>what</b> everyone <b>else</b> is doing. Endemol then threatened to sue.|$|R

5000|$|In 1989, Ashira Morgenstern, a poet {{living in}} Jerusalem, began {{inviting}} colleagues {{to compose a}} set number of lines for suggested titles. To explore and document serendipitous confluence, contributors do not <b>see</b> <b>what</b> anyone <b>else</b> has written until the lines are combined by the moderator according to a set, pre-established pattern. The order of line insertion is based simply on the date the contributing material is received. Except for changes in punctuation, not one word of the original separate poems is changed. In 2004, poet Esther Cameron published some of these combined poems on her website: http://www.pointandcircumference.com/kippatbinah/compoem-intro.htm ...|$|R
50|$|Free Actions {{take such}} little time {{that can be}} {{performed}} immediately and do not use up time, such as dropping an item, standing up, or calling to an ally. The character in a party with the highest Reflexes stat acts first, or they can hold the action and wait to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> someone <b>else</b> is doing. There are no Initiative checks unless the Referee decides to randomly see who goes first. In such a case, the Reflexes Stat {{can be added to}} the 3d6 die roll. Usually a party of several NPC's act on one Initiative. Initiative is rolled again for each combat Phase, or to save time, the GM can opt to use the same initiative {{for the rest of the}} combat scene.|$|R

Other people who have also contributed to this thesis, but in a different way...|$|R
5000|$|Following {{a painful}} divorce {{from his wife}} Nickie, Robert Forester leaves New York and moves to a Langley, Pennsylvania, a small town, where he {{develops}} an obsession for 23-year-old Jenny Thierolf. He spies on her through her kitchen window, enjoying [...] "the girl's placid temperament, her obvious affection for her rather ramshackle house, her contentment with her life". He is surprised when she invites him into her house after spotting him one night. Each seems to represent something more for the other than it appears, to embody a larger emotional force than a mere personality. Robert explains to his therapist: [...] "'I have the definite feeling if {{everybody in the world}} didn't keep watching to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> everybody <b>else</b> did, we'd all go berserk. Left on their own, people wouldn't know how to live.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|Though {{he has now}} {{risen to}} the top of Washington society, he remains very mysterious. The Secret Service is unable to find any {{background}} information about him. Public opinion polls start to reflect just how much his [...] "simple brand of wisdom" [...] resonates with the jaded American public. The President even begins to fear Chance's popularity with the public. During this time Rand's physician, Dr. Allenby, becomes increasingly suspicious of Chance, and seems to be able to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> everyone <b>else</b> cannot - that Chance is not a wise political expert and that the mystery of his identity may have a more mundane explanation. Dr. Allenby considers confiding his suspicions to Rand but when he realizes how happy Chance is making him during his final days he decides not to.|$|R

60|$|He now {{looked around}} to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>else</b> he should take, and thought of an umbrella, a rain-coat, a book or two to read during the journey, and several things besides; but he ended by leaving them all behind.|$|E
60|$|That simple {{statement}} of the case {{was by no means}} all that went on in Ann Veronica's mind. But it was the form of her ruling determination; it was the only form that she ever allowed to <b>see</b> daylight. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> was there lurked in shadows and deep places; if in some mood of reverie it came out into the light, it was presently overwhelmed and hustled back again into hiding. She would never look squarely at these dream forms that mocked the social order in which she lived, never admit she listened to the soft whisperings in her ear. But Manning seemed more and more clearly indicated as a refuge, as security. Certain simple purposes emerged from the disingenuous muddle of her feelings and desires. Seeing Capes from day to day made a bright eventfulness that hampered her in the course she had resolved to follow. She vanished from the laboratory for a week, a week of oddly interesting days....|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to Dickinson's return to writing, {{the album was}} also notable for its number of co-written pieces, in contrast to its predecessor, with five of the eight tracks being collaborative efforts. According to Harris, this was probably because they [...] "spent more time checking up on each other to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> everybody <b>else</b> was up to, {{just to make sure}} the story fitted properly and went somewhere." [...] To make sure each song fit with the record's concept, the band drew up a basic outline for the story, which Harris states [...] "didn't make the actual writing any easier ... I probably took longer over the writing I've done on this album than any I've done before. But the stuff we all started coming up with, once we'd agreed that we were definitely going for a fully fledged 'concept' album, really startled me. It was so much better than anything we'd done in ages..." ...|$|R
