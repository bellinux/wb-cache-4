5|$|The {{earliest}} change detectable on laboratory investigations {{is a low}} {{white blood}} cell count, which may then be followed by low platelets and metabolic acidosis. A moderately elevated level of aminotransferase (AST and ALT) from the liver is commonly associated with low platelets and white blood cells. In severe disease, plasma leakage results in hemoconcentration (as indicated by a rising hematocrit) and hypoalbuminemia. Pleural effusions or ascites can be detected by physical examination when large, but the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of dengue <b>shock</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings. Dengue <b>shock</b> <b>syndrome</b> is present if pulse pressure drops to ≤20mmHg along with peripheral vascular collapse. Peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed capillary refill, rapid heart rate, or cold extremities. While warning signs are an important aspect for early detection of potential serious disease, the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Henson's death, doctor David Gelmont first {{announced}} that he died from Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterial infection that causes bacterial pneumonia. However, on May 29, Gelmont later confirmed that Henson's {{cause of death was}} organ failure resulting from streptococcal toxic <b>shock</b> <b>syndrome</b> (caused by Streptococcus pyogenes). S. pyogenes is the bacterial species that causes strep throat, scarlet fever, and rheumatic fever. It can also cause other infections.|$|E
40|$|<b>Shock</b> <b>syndromes</b> are {{of three}} types: cardiogenic, hemorrhagic and inflammatory. Hemorrhagic shock has its initial {{deranged}} macro-hemodynamic {{variables in the}} blood volume and venous return. In cardiogenic shock there is a primary pump failure that has cardiac output/mean arterial pressure as initial deranged variables. In Inflammatory Shock it is the microcirculation that is mainly affected, while the initial deranged macrocirculation variable is the total peripheral resistance hit by systemic inflammatory response...|$|R
30|$|Introduction: Superantigen toxins {{synthesized}} by S. aureus or by S. pyogenes {{are responsible}} for toxic <b>shock</b> <b>syndromes</b> (TSS) which lethality can reach 28 %. High dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), able to neutralize these toxins, are frequently used even tough evidence of its efficacy is not supported by randomized controlled study (RCT). Moreover, IVIG are expensive and possibly harmful. Before conducting a RCT, a pilot study was first designed to assess the feasibility {{in the context of}} pediatric critical care.|$|R
40|$|The {{integrity}} of the vascular wall and its intrinsic basement membrane structures ensure that plasma and the corpuscular elements of the blood remain confined to the intravascular milieu and can enter into the extravascular compartment in a well controlled fashion in cases of tissue infection or inflammation. However, sometimes inflammatory stimuli act on blood leukocytes and on endothelial cells from within the blood vessels and in an overwhelming way, leading to inflammatory <b>shock</b> <b>syndromes.</b> These severe conditions with high mortality rates are characterized by intravascular neutrophil degranulation, permeability changes of endothelia and disintegration of basement membranes and lead to almost uncontrollable edema, coagulation changes and multi-organ failure. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been functionally linked with septic and endotoxin shock, with cytokine release syndromes and with acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here we review a number of association studies, compare inflammatory shock data from gene knockout studies in mice and provide some insights from recent investigations with inhibitors of MMPs. This evaluation strengthens the expectation that MMP inhibitors, in particular those blocking neutrophil proteases, may become useful in the early phase of acute inflammatory <b>shock</b> <b>syndromes.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Being a hunt-driven dog, the Jack Russell {{will usually}} pursue most creatures that it encounters. This {{includes}} the skunk, and the breed {{is prone to}} skunk toxic <b>shock</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The chemical in the skunk spray is absorbed by the dog and causes the red blood cells to undergo haemolysis, which can occasionally lead to fatal anaemia and kidney failure. If sprayed underground, it can also cause chemical burning of the cornea. Treatments are available to flush the toxin out of the dog's system.|$|E
5|$|Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne {{tropical}} disease {{caused by the}} dengue virus. Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In {{a small proportion of}} cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue <b>shock</b> <b>syndrome,</b> where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.|$|E
5|$|Henson died {{of toxic}} <b>shock</b> <b>syndrome</b> on May 16, 1990, at age 53, twenty hours after {{experiencing}} a medical emergency—an unexpected event that was widely lamented {{in the film}} and television industries. In the weeks after his death, he was celebrated {{in a wave of}} tributes. He was posthumously inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1991, and as a Disney Legend in 2011.|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} aspects of <b>shock</b> <b>syndromes</b> are described from their inception as compensated physiology to {{a stage of}} decompensation. The clinical significance of hypotension, fluid-responsive and non fluid-responsive hypotension, is discussed. Untimely or inadequate treatment leads to persistent subclinical shock despite adjustments of the macrohemodynamic variables, which evolves in a second hit of physiological deterioration if not aggressively managed. Irreversible shock ensues as consequence of direct hit or as result of inadequate or delayed treatment and is characterized by drug-resistant hypotension...|$|R
30|$|The main {{symptoms}} were fever (100 %), purpura (28.6 %), digestive disorders (42.8 %) and neurological signs mainly consciousness disorders (28.6 %). The <b>shock,</b> infectious <b>syndrome,</b> purpura, neurological and respiratory disorders dominated the clinical background at admission.|$|R

5|$|Clindamycin is used {{in cases}} of {{suspected}} toxic <b>shock</b> <b>syndrome,</b> often in combination with a bactericidal agent such as vancomycin. The rationale for this approach is a presumed synergy between vancomycin, which causes {{the death of the}} bacteria by breakdown of the cell wall, and clindamycin, which is a powerful inhibitor of toxin synthesis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown clindamycin reduces the production of exotoxins by staphylococci; it may also induce changes in the surface structure of bacteria that make them more sensitive to immune system attack (opsonization and phagocytosis).|$|E
5|$|Contraceptive sponges {{combine a}} barrier with a spermicide. Like diaphragms, they are {{inserted}} vaginally before intercourse {{and must be}} placed over the cervix to be effective. Typical failure rates {{during the first year}} depend on whether or not a woman has previously given birth, being 24% in those who have and 12% in those who have not. The sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward. Allergic reactions and more severe adverse effects such as toxic <b>shock</b> <b>syndrome</b> have been reported.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why {{secondary}} infection with a different strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue <b>shock</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The most widely accepted hypothesis is that of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The exact mechanism behind ADE is unclear. It {{may be caused by}} poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have ingested the virus for destruction. There is a suspicion that ADE is not the only mechanism underlying severe dengue-related complications, and various lines of research have implied a role for T cells and soluble factors such as cytokines and the complement system.|$|E

40|$|Gelatinase B or matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) {{is stored}} in the {{tertiary}} granules of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These cells are key effectors in acute inflammatory diseases such as sepsis. Endotoxin leads to rapid release of gelatinase B from these granules in vitro and in vivo, but the role of this enzyme in bacterial sepsis and endotoxin shock remains unclear. We studied the clinical course of endotoxinemia and its relation with the expression of gelatinase B from the pool of circulating leukocytes in adult {{as well as in}} young mice in a model of endotoxin-induced shock and compared wild-type with gelatinase B-deficient mice. The gelatinase B-deficient mice were resistant to endotoxin shock, which implies that specific MMP- 9 inhibition constitutes anapproach for the treatment of septic <b>shock</b> <b>syndromes.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Microbial superantigens are {{a family}} of protein exotoxins that share the ability to trigger {{excessive}} and aberrant activation of T cells. The best characterised are the staphylococcal enterotoxins and the streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins that trigger the staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic <b>shock</b> <b>syndromes.</b> It is now apparent that superantigens have a wider role in the pathology of infectious diseases than has previously been appreciated. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes together produce 19 different superantigens. The range of microorganisms known to produce superantigens has expanded to include Gram negative bacteria, mycoplasma, and viruses. Research is beginning {{to shed light on}} the more subtle parts these molecules play in causing disease and to produce some real possibilities for specific treatment of superantigen-induced toxicity. We aim to highlight these new developments and review the science behind these fascinating molecules...|$|R
5|$|Playtex Products {{continued}} to erode Tampax's' market share throughout the late 20th century. The two companies had divided the market almost evenly {{by the late}} 1990s. Both makers increased profits primarily by reducing the tampon count per box, and prepared to enter emerging markets, particularly in Asia, where many women still used homemade pads. In 1997 Procter & Gamble (P), makers of Always sanitary napkins and pantiliners, bought Tambrands for $1.25 billion, its largest acquisition up to that point, returning to the tampon sector almost two decades after pulling Rely from the market over Toxic <b>Shock</b> <b>Syndrome</b> concerns.|$|E
5|$|S.iniae has {{occasionally}} produced {{infection in}} humans, especially fish handlers of Asian descent. Human infections include sepsis, toxic <b>shock</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and {{inflammation of the}} skin, intervertebral discs, or inner layer of the heart. Identifying S.iniae in the laboratory can be difficult, since the conventional methods used to identify streptococci yield insufficient results. It cannot be grouped by the Lancefield antigen method typically used to categorize Streptococcus species. The two known serotypes can be distinguished biochemically by differences in enzyme activity. Several antibiotics {{have been used to}} treat S.iniae infections.|$|E
5|$|The marked {{spread of}} dengue {{during and after}} the Second World War has been {{attributed}} to ecologic disruption. The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas, and to the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever. This severe form of the disease was first reported in the Philippines in 1953; by the 1970s, it had become a major cause of child mortality and had emerged in the Pacific and the Americas. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue <b>shock</b> <b>syndrome</b> were first noted in Central and South America in 1981, as DENV-2 was contracted by people who had previously been infected with DENV-1 several years earlier.|$|E

40|$|Gelatinase B/matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) is a {{regulatory}} and effector metalloproteinase in inflammation.

Both metallo-enzymes play important roles during the development of <b>shock</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Combinatorial chemical synthesis and subsequent library deconvolution were previously used to define a peptide inhibitor (Regasepin 1) acting, almost to the same degree, on neutrophil collagenase/MMP- 8 and MMP- 9 in vitro, and protecting mice against lethal endotoxinemia in vivo. We have now extended this approach by incorporating D-form amino acids and residues preferred by TACE. A new peptide library was designed and synthesized, and by deconvolution new peptide inhibitors were defined. These included a TACE-specific inhibitor, an MMP- 9 - specific inhibitor, and inhibitors for both enzymes. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|In some people, {{the disease}} {{proceeds}} to a critical phase as fever resolves. During this period, there is {{leakage of plasma}} from the blood vessels, typically lasting one to two days. This may result in fluid accumulation {{in the chest and}} abdominal cavity as well as depletion of fluid from the circulation and decreased blood supply to vital organs. There may also be organ dysfunction and severe bleeding, typically from the gastrointestinal tract. Shock (dengue <b>shock</b> <b>syndrome)</b> and hemorrhage (dengue hemorrhagic fever) occur in less than 5% of all cases of dengue, however those who have previously been infected with other serotypes of dengue virus ("secondary infection") are at an increased risk. This critical phase, while rare, occurs relatively more commonly in children and young adults.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe stimulatory or {{inhibitory}} {{effects of}} plant lectins {{on the production}} of gelatinase A (MMP- 2) and gelatinase B (MMP- 9) by mononuclear white blood cells was investigated by substrate zymography. Leukocyte cultures from 24 -h old buffy coats were spontaneously activated and produced high levels of gelatinase B. Using such cultures the suppressing activity of the Datura stramonium, Viscum album, Bauhinia purpurea, Triticum aestivum and Maackia amurensis lectins on gelatinase B induction were demonstrated. When fresh leukocyte preparations from single blood donors were used, low levels of gelatinase B were produced. The induction of gelatinase B was confirmed for concanavalin A and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA-L 4). In addition, the Urtica dioica, Calystegia sepium, Convolvulus arvensis and Colchicum autumnale lectins were documented as novel and potent inducers of gelatinase B.

40|$|Gelatinase B/MMP- 9 {{fulfills}} crucial regulator or effector {{functions in}} disease states {{and may be}} pharmacologically targeted by specific inhibitors. The characteristics of cleavages of a natural gelatinase B substrate were simulated and amino acids with zinc-ion chelating side-groups were employed to design a library of peptide-based inhibitors. Here, we extend previous findings of combinatorial chemical synthesis and subsequent library deconvolution with a recently established high-throughput technology. This enabled us to study MMP inhibitors with two zinc-binding groups and to identify a new L-pyridylalanine-containing gelatinase B inhibitor. The peptide analog was found to inhibit, almost to the same degree, the neutrophil enzymes collagenase 2 / MMP- 8 and MMP- 9 and the monocytic tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM- 17) in vitro and to protect mice against lethal endotoxinemia in vivo.

40|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} are a phylogenetically {{diverse group of}} ubiquitous microorganisms {{that are involved in}} a wide variety of human infectious diseases. Over the last 20 to 30 years, several species belonging to this group have demonstrated a remarkable ability to produce striking human illnesses never seen or only seldom encountered in the past. Furthermore, a number of newly described species of gram-positive bacteria have also emerged as important human pathogens during this period. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [1] and the Harvard Working Group on New and Resurgent Diseases [2], emerging infectious diseases are those that are occurring with increasing frequency or that are associated with more severe clinical manifestations, symptoms distinct from those of any previous disease, new patient populations or geographic areas, or newly described human pathogens.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} {{that the development}} of irreversibility in shock initiated by trauma or hemorrhage is mediated primarily by a breakdown of bacterial defense mechanisms and an attendant vasculo-toxic sequela. The validity of this thesis rests in large part on experiments in dogs and rabbits (1, 2) in which pretreatment with antibiotics successfully circumvented the fatal consequences of a standardized episode of hemorrhagic shock. Further support has been derived from indirect evidence: a decreased tolerance to bacterial endotoxins (3), a fall in blood properdin levels (4), and an impaired capacity to clear bacteria from the bloodstream {{during the course of the}} shock reactions (5). The pathophysiologic alterations produced by bacterial endotoxins have been shown in recent experiments (6, 7) to be strikingly similar to the vascular manifestations of the <b>shock</b> <b>syndromes</b> produced by hemorrhage and trauma.
