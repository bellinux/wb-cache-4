30|$|The {{forecasting}} process {{starts with}} the last epoch of the main field derived from satellite and observatory data (i.e. 2014.5). For this time point, the <b>secular</b> variation <b>and</b> <b>secular</b> acceleration of the field are computed from the steady flow velocity and acceleration models. Equations 7 and 8 {{show that there is}} a dependence of the <b>secular</b> variation <b>and</b> <b>secular</b> acceleration on the main field itself. Hence, the process is non-linear and has to be stepped forwards at a suitably fine time resolution, in this case, 1 month (Beggan and Whaler 2010). Each month, a new set of matrices relating flow velocity <b>and</b> acceleration to <b>secular</b> variation <b>and</b> <b>secular</b> acceleration are computed based on the main field <b>and</b> <b>secular</b> variation coefficients. This generates a set of predicted <b>secular</b> variation <b>and</b> <b>secular</b> acceleration coefficients, which are added back to the main field coefficients to give the prediction of the main field for the following month. The Gauss coefficients of the main field were advected forward from 2014.5 to 2020.0. The coefficients of the average annual secular variation (in nT/year) were calculated from the difference of the main field models at 2020.0 and 2015.0, divided by 5 years.|$|R

5|$|The post-Chalukya {{period is}} characterised by the {{popularity}} of Shaiva and Vaishnava devotional writings, though <b>secular</b> <b>and</b> courtly topics written in native metres continued to flourish. Native metres in vogue were the shatpadi (six-line verse), the tripadi, the ragle (rhymed couplets) and the sangatya (compositions meant to be sung to the accompaniment a musical instrument). Overall, Kannada writings began to change from marga ("formal", due to Sanskritic influence) to desi ("vernacular") and become more accessible to the common man.|$|E
5|$|Anselm stuck {{firmly to}} {{the letter of the}} papal decree, despite Henry's {{attempts}} to persuade him to give way in return for a vague assurance of a future royal compromise. Matters escalated, with Anselm going back into exile and Henry confiscating the revenues of his estates. Anselm threatened excommunication, and in July 1105 the two men finally negotiated a solution. A distinction was drawn between the <b>secular</b> <b>and</b> ecclesiastical powers of the prelates, under which Henry gave up his right to invest his clergy, but retained the custom of requiring them to come and do homage for the temporalities, the landed properties they held in England. Despite this argument, the pair worked closely together, combining to deal with Duke Robert's invasion of 1101, for example, and holding major reforming councils in 1102 and 1108.|$|E
5|$|Coolsma left Cianjur in 1869 {{and went}} to Bogor, also a majority-Sundanese city. He found little success in preaching to the European {{citizens}} of the city or converting the Sundanese. On 31 May 1869, he opened a school at his home, which provided a free education in both <b>secular</b> <b>and</b> religious studies. The first class had ten students, a total which grew quickly; at its peak, the school had 111 students. After a government-funded school was opened in 1872, most of the Sundanese students moved there to avoid the Christian teachings. The remaining students were mostly ethnic Chinese, few of whom converted.|$|E
30|$|For each of {{the models}} {{used in the study}} of Chulliat and Maus (2014), the Gauss {{coefficients}} of the magnetic scalar potential were parameterized as a second order Taylor series in time, with the first derivative corresponding to the linear <b>secular</b> variation <b>and</b> the second derivative corresponding to the secular acceleration. Models were computed using a sliding window which included 3 years of CHAMP data. While a 3 -year window introduces some time averaging of the resulting coefficients, it was found that this length was necessary to obtain stable estimates of the <b>secular</b> variation <b>and</b> <b>secular</b> acceleration parameters. Damping was applied to the secular variation coefficients above degree 13 <b>and</b> <b>secular</b> acceleration coefficients above degree 8. All coefficients were estimated using least squares minimization of the data residuals. The latest model estimated from this method had an epoch of 2009.17. For our final DGRF candidate, we extrapolated the main field coefficients to epoch 2010.0 using the <b>secular</b> variation <b>and</b> <b>secular</b> acceleration coefficients <b>and</b> the second order Taylor series relation. Since this modeling method has been reported previously, we refer the reader to Maus et al. (2010) for further discussion and plots of the model residuals and their statistics.|$|R

5|$|Gaza {{has many}} {{universities}}. The four main {{universities in the}} city are al-Azhar University – Gaza, al-Quds Open University, al-Aqsa University and the Islamic University of Gaza. The Islamic University, consisting of ten facilities, was founded {{by a group of}} businessmen in 1978, making it the first University in Gaza. It had an enrollment of 20,639 students. Al-Azhar is generally <b>secular</b> <b>and</b> was founded in 1992. Al-Aqsa University was established in 1991. Al-Quds Open University established its Gaza Educational Region campus in 1992 in a rented building {{in the center of the}} city originally with 730 students. Because of the rapid increase of the number of students, it constructed the first university owned building in the Nasser District. In 2006–07, it had an enrollment of 3,778 students.|$|E
5|$|In 1930 or 1931, al-Qassam had {{recruited}} numerous hand-picked {{followers and}} organized them into {{about a dozen}} different circles, each group of supporters unaware {{of the existence of}} the other groups. The majority of his men were peasants and urban laborers. The majority of al-Qassam's circles were based in northern Palestine, but he had disciples throughout the country, including in Gaza in the south. In contrast to traditional Palestinian leaders who campaigned against Zionist settlement while avoiding confrontation with the British authorities, al-Qassam saw it as a priority to fight against both. He also saw the brewing conflict in Palestine as a religious struggle, unlike most Palestinian leaders who advocated a <b>secular</b> <b>and</b> nationalist response. Al-Qassam advocated a moral, political and military jihad as the solution to end British rule and Zionist aspirations in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|In Arabic, {{the word}} for street (الشارع, ash-shāriʿ) is derived from a root whose other forms denote a place of entry or beginning, {{the point of a}} weapon, and law or {{lawfulness}} and legitimacy in both the <b>secular</b> <b>and</b> religious sense. Among those words are sharia, the term for Islamic religious and moral law. Shāriʿ itself {{can also be used to}} refer to a legislator or lawgiver, and when used with the definite article al- in a religious context is a reference to God as the source of all religious law.|$|E

5|$|In all, the Renaissance {{could be}} viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the <b>secular</b> <b>and</b> worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel {{approaches}} to thought. Some scholars, such as Rodney Stark, play down the Renaissance in favor of the earlier innovations of the Italian city-states in the High Middle Ages, which married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism. This analysis argues that, whereas the great European states (France and Spain) were absolutist monarchies, and others were under direct Church control, the independent city republics of Italy took over the principles of capitalism invented on monastic estates and set off a vast unprecedented commercial revolution that preceded and financed the Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|Islamic feminists {{advocate}} women's rights, gender equality, {{and social}} justice grounded within an Islamic framework. Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the Quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, hadith (sayings of Muhammad), and sharia (law) towards {{the creation of a}} more equal and just society. Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized <b>secular</b> <b>and</b> Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.|$|E
