40|$|AbstractLightning stroke {{causes a}} current {{injection}} into transmission {{lines at the}} point of contact. The lightning performance can be difficult to understand without using simulation programs. PSCAD a powerful software was selected to develop the appropriate data required to investigate this phenomena. In this paper, two points along transmission line are selected for studying voltage–time (V–t) characteristics when any of those points is subjected to lightning strokes separately. The first assumed point is taken when lightning current is injected to the <b>shielding</b> <b>wire</b> {{at the top of the}} transmission tower, while, the other assumed point is taken when surge current is injected to the <b>shielding</b> <b>wire</b> at maximum sag location in the mid-span between two towers. The sag of transmission line has been newly developed and simulated using PSCAD. Both transmission line containing sag as well as lightning injection current are modeled. Fast transient of flashover as well as back flashover occurrence is investigated. The results revealed that the sag of transmission line has considerable influence on flashover and induced voltages across line insulators and phase lines as well. The influence of connecting surge arrester in substations is investigated. A proper transmission line arrester (TLA) is designed in order to minimize the occurrences of overvoltages due to flashover and consequently back flashover across insulators...|$|E

This thesis approaches the modeling of the coupling of a lightning stroke with a structure composed of a building associated to a wired network. By means of a formalism based on the transmission line theory associated to a topological approach, {{a study of the}} efficiency of a lightning protection device, composed of a <b>shielding</b> <b>wire</b> installed in the ground above the underground cable, is made in a exhaustive way by using experimental data obtained by means of triggered lightning. Furthermore, thanks to the antenna theory in the time domain (FDTD), the thesis also approaches the calculation of the currents generated simultaneously on a building and its wired network when the lighting stroke occurs on the considered structure.

40|$|Lightning strokes to {{transmission}} lines causes {{a majority of}} the power quality issues that are so severe that sensitive industrial loads are disturbed. Historically Vattenfall concluded that it is too expensive to use <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> for the 132 kV grid due to the high soil resistivity in Sweden. Today the situation is different with sensitive industrial loads and the current Vattenfall standard is to build portal tower with one <b>shield</b> <b>wire.</b> The <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> is however not used {{to reduce the amount of}} lightning faults, it is used to ground the cross arm and reduce the amount of short circuits. In this project the lightning performance of different tower configurations used in the 132 kV grid is investigated using statistical insulation coordination in the softwares LPE and PSCAD. The optimal placement of the <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> on towers located on flat ground is determined. Furthermore, the <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> configuration of a new portal tower with two <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> and typical Swedish conditions is proposed and compared to a portal tower with one <b>shield</b> <b>wire.</b> The demand is that the amount of lightning faults should be reduced by half compared to the case with a portal tower without <b>shield</b> <b>wires.</b> It is concluded that in order to achieve this decrease in the amount of faults a portal tower with one <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> requires a tower foot resistance of 16. 5 while a portal tower with two <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> requires a tower foot resistance of 35. 1. The distribution between single line to ground faults and short circuits for both configurations is estimated, where a second <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> proved to reduce the amount of short circuits. Furthermore, it is concluded that every cross arm needs to be grounded properly in order to achieve the desired lightning performance. A cost estimation based on an average 132 kV line with average loading showed that a second <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> could not cover its own costs. It is important to remember that the cost estimation is based on an average 132 kV line and it does not consider important industries or costs of groundings. If this would be included a second <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> could be profitable in some cases. Therefore it is recommended to consider the local conditions when deciding if a new transmission line is built with one or two <b>shield</b> <b>wires...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This {{paper has}} {{proposed}} a modeling method to simulate steady-state and transient induced voltages to an underground gas pipeline from an overhead transmission line. The simulation results of the steady-state ac induced voltages agree well with analytical results obtained from a well-known formula. The induced voltages are significantly dependent on the configuration of an overhead line. A hori-zontal line induces the largest voltage to a gas pipeline, and an induced voltage by a vertical twin-circuit line is smaller by about 20 % than that by a vertical single-circuit line. The simulation method is applied to investigate the effect of shielding wires and plates on reduction of the induced volt-age, and the simulation results agree well with analytical re-sults. It {{has been found that}} the induced voltage can be re-duced by about 10 % by one <b>shielding</b> <b>wire</b> and by about 25 % by five shielding wires, and an iron plate can reduce the in-duced voltage by about 50 % assuming the shielding wires and the plate are ideally grounded...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{technique}} to eliminate crosstalk delay in DSM Technology is {{by placing a}} <b>shielding</b> <b>wire</b> between every adjacent wire. But this technique has a drawback of doubling the wiring area. Several Bus Encoding Techniques have been proposed by several authors to eliminate/reduce crosstalk delay in VLSI inter connects without placing a shielding wires. Some of these methods are based on routing strategies, which employ various routing techniques to minimize crosstalk delay within a data-path or logic block. The main idea is to prevent simultaneous opposite transitions by skewing signal transition timing of adjacent wires. The crosstalk {{is dependent on the}} data transition patterns on the bus, patterns can be classified based on the severity of the crosstalk they impose on the bus. The general idea behind techniques that improve on-chip bus speed is to remove undesirable patterns that are associated with certain classes of crosstalk. Different schemes incur different area overheads since they require additional wires, spacing between wires or both. The number of bits used for the representation of encoding information is high. Encoding all the data irrespective of the presence of forbidden patterns leads to some unwanted crosstalk. The bus encoding schemes in the literature, that describes forbidden transitions free crosstalk avoidance CODEC designs, does not address the area overhead caused by extra wires and calculates bus energy dissipation based on this premise. It does not evaluate an encoding method’s viability from the perspectives of crosstalk noise and noise-induced delay. We compare the area over head required for various bus encoding schemes that describes forbidden transitions free cross talk avoidance CODEC designs and we propose certain modifications for achieving more reduction in power and crosstalk delay with least energy over head in redundant wires...|$|E
40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Electrical Engineering for the MScused in Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to optical fiber communication to serve the increasing communication requirements (voice & data) with power system expansion in progress. // As a first step, CEB has added one Optical Fiber Ground Wire (OPGW) with twenty four optical fibers to all new lines constructed after year 2000. It was identified that the incorporation of optical fibers to selected lines linking generation stations and grid substations to System Control Centre (SCC) can make the backbone optical fiber communication network. // Thirty numbers of transmission lines of total length 562. 1 km can link all important generation stations and grid substations to SCC of CEB and those lines were selected to incorporate optical fibers for stage I communication network of this study. // Optical fibers manufactured to different standards {{are available in the}} market. It was found that the optical fibers manufactured to the standard ITU-T-G. 652 is the best for the stage I communication network. // The replacement of one <b>shielding</b> <b>wire</b> by OPGW is the best method to incorporate optical fibers to CEB transmission lines, out of the different methods used in the world to incorporate optical fibers to overhead lines. It is beneficial for CEB to select a single OPGW type to replace all types of ground shielding wires in transmission lines selected for stage I communication network. OPGW types available in the market with overall diameter 11. 80 mm, ultimate tensile strength 68. 0 KN and tube (to enclose the fibers) made of stainless steel with aluminum clad was selected as the best suited OPGW for this purpose. // Practical problems and cost associated with power outages proved that the live-line stringing is more economical for the lines selected for stagel. Supply and live-line installation cost of OPGW for stage I is 7, 796 USD/km (805, 716 LKR km, as per the present exchange rate) and it is 15. 6 % higher than the supply and dead-line installation cost of the same. Further, {{it was found that the}} addition of one OPGW mentioned above to new 132 kV double circuit Zebra lines is only 3. 2 % of the total construction cost of the line. Therefore, adding one OPGW to all new transmission lines to be constructed in CEB is justifiable. // There is a good opportunity for CEB to enter into a communication business using the extra fibers available with its transmission network which covers all populated areas of the inland. However, it is to be studied in detail before entering to this challenging business...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{describes}} new methodology in {{the current}} unbalance calculations in meshed grids. The meshed grids, mainly the transmission ones, consist of more parts connected together which are formed using different conductor types, phase sequence arrangements, tower constructions, and various number of lines on the same tower. Therefore several computational challenges arise {{in comparison with the}} widely discussed point-to-point configuration. The methodology divides the grid into a number of impedance matrices respecting all the self and mutual impedances among all conductors and all parallel lines. Another challenging issue for the lines impedance description is changing the number of <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> along the line if the line is composed of several sections with different tower configurations. For the current unbalance calculation, <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> must also be included in the algorithms, and matrices of various dimensions can be obtained. For the overall matrix description to be used, dimensions of all matrices in final equations must be equal, and therefore the virtual <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> are created. To compare more conductor transposition cases with each other, the line loadings caused by voltage sources should be equal. This is necessary mainly in case of meshed grids where the supplying sources on different lines can have strong mutual couplings. This can be achieved by an appropriately designed optimization of the connected voltage sources.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we first}} show that {{existing}} net ordering formulations to minimize noise {{are no longer}} valid with presence of inductive noise, and shield insertion is needed to minimize inductive noise. We then formulate two simultaneous shield insertion and net ordering (SINO) problems: the optimal SINO/NF problem to find a min-area SINO solution that is free of capacitive and inductive noise, and the optimal SINO/NB problem to find a min-area SINO solution that is free of capacitive noise and is under the given inductive noise bound. We reveal that both optimal SINO problems are NP-hard, and propose effective approximate algorithms for the two problems. Experiments show that our SINO/NB algorithm uses from 15 % to 57 % fewer <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> when compared to separated net ordering and shield insertion procedure. Furthermore, under practical noise bounds, the SINO/NB solutions use from 44 % to 67 % fewer <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> when compared to SINO/NF solutions, and use 10 % to 40 % fewer <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> {{when compared to the}} theoretical lower bound for optimal SINO/NF solutions.

50|$|Overhead {{power lines}} are often {{equipped}} with a ground conductor (<b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> or overhead earth wire). The ground conductor is usually grounded (earthed) {{at the top of}} the supporting structure, to minimize the likelihood of direct lightning strikes to the phase conductors. In circuits with earthed neutral, it also serves as a parallel path with the earth for fault currents. Very high-voltage transmission lines may have two ground conductors. These are either at the outermost ends of the highest cross beam, at two V-shaped mast points, or at a separate cross arm. Older lines may use surge arresters every few spans in place of a shield wire; this configuration is typically found in the more rural areas of the United States. By protecting the line from lightning, the design of apparatus in substations is simplified due to lower stress on insulation. <b>Shield</b> <b>wires</b> on transmission lines may include optical fibers (optical ground wires/OPGW), used for communication and control of the power system.|$|R

The meshed system consists of several sections with different phase arrangements, a different number of transmission lines on one tower, and a different number of <b>shield</b> <b>wires.</b> Some basic aspects of current unbalance have been mentioned in Sect.  1. As for calculations, several challenges described in Sect.  2 have been solved. Since {{it may be necessary}} to connect sections with a different number of <b>shield</b> <b>wires,</b> the virtual <b>shield</b> <b>wires</b> have been created to keep impedance matrix dimensions, and the correct values of line supplying voltage sources have been determined for the required average values of the line currents by an appropriately designed optimization process. The unbalance factors for all the possible phase arrangements in the selected section C have been calculated, and the best solution has been found. The aforementioned procedures have been demonstrated in a case study of part of Czech transmission system designed for a new 400 kV substation connection. The best calculated transposition in section C was used, and values of calculated unbalance factors have been verified after putting the substation into operation. The measurement has shown very good agreement with the calculated values with an error less than 8 %. This is accepted as a very successful result taking into consideration a range of the line input parameters uncertainties. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the unbalance factor has been performed with view to the fact that the grounding input data is never easy to determine.|$|R

ADLash® is {{the trade}} name for an {{optical fibre cable}} {{attached}} to a transmission line <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> using aramid-reinforced bands. The installation {{of this type of}} optic fibre cable has been considered for the HVDC line from the Songo hydroelectric scheme at Cahora Bassa in Mozambique, to Apollo substation in South Africa. The impact that installation of this cable will have on the onset of corona is examined. The <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> with and without ADLash attached is modelled for both the actual line configuration and for corona cage studies. The electric field is calculated using the Method of Images and the Boundary Element Method to predict the electric field enhancements and to estimate the corona onset gradient. Corona onset gradients and phenomena for smooth and stranded conductors are researched to aid the prediction of voltage onset magnitudes for the corona cage. Estimated values are compared with observed values for both AC and DC applied voltages. Different patterns of corona and different corona onset voltages are observed for AC and negative DC applied voltages. The relative permittivity of the ADLash is higher than the surrounding air and this is shown to lead to greatly enhanced electric fields at the air/ dielectric/ <b>shield</b> <b>wire</b> interfaces that are significant enough to cause corona at the rated operating voltage. The corona will bombard the ADLash and probably damage it.
