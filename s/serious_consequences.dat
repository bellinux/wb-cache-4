5|$|Important {{sexual health}} issues for women include Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) and {{female genital cutting}} (FGC). STIs are a global health priority because they have <b>serious</b> <b>consequences</b> for women and infants. Mother-to-child transmission of STIs can lead to stillbirths, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, sepsis, pneumonia, neonatal conjunctivitis, and congenital deformities. Syphilis in pregnancy results in over 300,000 fetal and neonatal deaths per year, and 215,000 infants with {{an increased risk of}} death from prematurity, low-birth-weight or congenital disease.|$|E

Māori women would sometimes tattoo images of lizards, some of which may represent tuatara, near their genitals. Today, tuatara are regarded as a taonga (special treasure).|$|E

In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he {{considered}} the situation surrounding his sister, the French Queen Marie Antoinette, and her children, with greater and greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pilnitz, in which they declared {{the interest of the}} monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family.

5|$|Hitler later {{blamed the}} failure of his {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, {{which had to be}} delayed, on Mussolini's failed conquest of Greece. The theory that the Battle of Greece delayed the invasion of the Soviet Union has been refuted by the majority of historians, who have accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame from himself to his ally, Italy. It nevertheless had <b>serious</b> <b>consequences</b> for the Axis war effort in the North African theatre.

5|$|Initially, {{the rulers}} of Europe {{considered}} the 1789 revolution in France as an affair between the French king and his subjects, and not a matter in which they should interfere. However, as the rhetoric grew more strident after 1790, the European monarchs began to view the French upheavals with alarm. Among the concerned monarchs were the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, who feared for the life and well-being of his sister, the Queen of France, Marie Antoinette. In August 1791, in consultation with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, in which they declared {{the interest of the}} monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis XVI and his family.

5|$|Aside {{from his}} {{profound}} differences with psychoanalytic ideas, the theoretical basis of Bowlby's monograph was controversial {{in a number}} of ways. Some profoundly disagreed with the necessity for maternal (or equivalent) love in order to function normally, or that the formation of an ongoing relationship with a child was an important part of parenting. The idea that early experiences have <b>serious</b> <b>consequences</b> for intellectual and psychosocial development was controversial in itself. Others questioned the extent to which his hypothesis was supported by the evidence. There was criticism of the confusion of the effects of privation (no primary attachment figure) and deprivation (loss of the primary attachment figure) and in particular, of the failure to distinguish between the effects of the lack of a primary attachment figure and the other forms of deprivation and understimulation that might affect children in institutions.|$|E

5|$|From 1988, environmentalists started {{actively}} {{opposing the}} Triangle Link. The most active were the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth, who stated that the road would have <b>serious</b> <b>consequences</b> for the local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. Instead, they recommended that the municipalities chose a pontoon bridge. Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who argued to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections, to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well be 60 as 15 years. He instead wanted to collect tolls in advance.|$|E

5|$|The Kaqchikel {{people were}} {{closely related to}} the K'iche', their former allies. The K'iche'an peoples (including the Kaqchikel, the K'iche' and others) had {{received}} strong influences from central Mexico since the time of the great Early Classic metropolis of Teotihuacan. The history of Iximche is largely drawn from the Annals of the Kaqchikels, a document written in the Kaqchikel language but using Latin characters soon after the Spanish Conquest. This document details the origins, history and conquest of the Kaqchikels. The Kaqchikel served as close allies of the K'iche' for many years. The Kaqchikel rulers Hun-Toh and Wuqu-Batz' served the great K'iche' king K'iq'ab with such loyalty that he rewarded them with the royal titles Ahpo Sotz'il and Ahpo Xahil and the power to rule. The sons of K'iq'ab became jealous of the growing power of the Kaqchikel lords and led a revolt against their father that seriously damaged his authority. This revolt had <b>serious</b> <b>consequences</b> for the K'iche' as their conquered domains seized the opportunity to break free from their subjugation.|$|E

5|$|Despite the ruthlessness and {{determination}} of the supporters of the coup, the rebels failed to take any major cities with the critical exception of Seville which provided a landing point for Franco’s African troops. The primarily conservative and Catholic areas of Old Castile and León fell quickly, and in Pamplona they celebrated the uprising {{as if it were}} a festival. The government retained control of Málaga, Jaén and Almería. Cadiz was taken for the rebels with the help of the first troops from the Army of Africa. In Madrid they were hemmed into the Montaña barracks. The barracks fell the next day, with much bloodshed. Republican leader Santiago Casares Quiroga was replaced by José Giral who ordered the distribution of weapons among the civilian population. This facilitated the defeat of the army insurrection in the main industrial centres, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and other main cities in the Mediterranean area, but it allowed the anarchists to arm themselves and take control of Barcelona and large swathes of Aragon and Catalonia. In Barcelona, the official government lost control of security, essential services and welfare. However, the anarchists held back from demanding too much political power, which could have had even more <b>serious</b> <b>consequences.</b> General Goded surrendered in Barcelona and was later condemned to death, despite broadcasting a message explaining his captivity over the radio at the request of the authorities.|$|E

The French position became increasingly difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. Although the Coalition forces achieved several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, the efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Peace of Leoben (17 April 1797) and the subsequent Treaty of Campo Formio (17 October 1797).|$|E
