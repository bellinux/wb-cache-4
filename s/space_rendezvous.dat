5|$|Based on {{studies to}} grow the Mercury {{spacecraft}} capabilities to long-duration flights, developing <b>space</b> <b>rendezvous</b> techniques, and precision Earth landing, Project Gemini was started as a two-man program in 1962 to overcome the Soviets' lead and to support the Apollo manned lunar landing program, adding extravehicular activity (EVA) and rendezvous and docking to its objectives. The first manned Gemini flight, Gemini 3, was flown by Gus Grissom and John Young on March 23, 1965. Nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days, rendezvous, docking, and practical EVA, and gathering medical data {{on the effects of}} weightlessness on humans.|$|E
5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first Apollo mission as a joint <b>space</b> <b>rendezvous</b> with the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E

25|$|Gemini's {{objective}} was {{the development of}} space travel techniques to support the Apollo mission to land astronauts on the Moon. It performed missions long enough {{for a trip to}} the Moon and back, perfected working outside the spacecraft with extra-vehicular activity (EVA), and pioneered the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve <b>space</b> <b>rendezvous</b> and docking. With these new techniques proven by Gemini, Apollo could pursue its prime mission without doing these fundamental exploratory operations.|$|E
25|$|Gemini was {{equipped}} with an Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System (OAMS), containing sixteen thrusters for translation control in all three perpendicular axes (forward/backward, left/right, up/down), in addition to attitude control (pitch, yaw, and roll angle orientation) as in Mercury. Translation control allowed changing orbital inclination and altitude, necessary to perform <b>space</b> <b>rendezvous</b> with other craft, and docking with the Agena Target Vehicle (ATV), with its own rocket engine {{which could be used}} to perform greater orbit changes.|$|E
25|$|O'Keefe {{responded to}} President Bush's 'Vision for Exploration' by hiring retired Navy Admiral Craig E. Steidle who had {{previously}} led development of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) as an associate administrator in charge of NASA's new Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD). He developed a mission architecture for lunar exploration based on four launches of medium-lift vehicles and four <b>space</b> <b>rendezvous</b> per mission, which was immediately scrapped by Michael Griffin upon his arrival at NASA. NASA started over with the Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS), sixteen months after Bush's Vision for Space Exploration announcement. This led to the Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles (later canceled) and the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle.|$|E

40|$|Prior to {{the launch}} of the STS- 132 /ULF 4 mission, the International Space Station (ISS) Flight Control Team was alerted to the {{approach}} of a space debris with a predicted time of closest approach approximately 1 hr after Space Shuttle docking. As a result, the ISS team considered performing a collision avoidance maneuver prior to the Space Shuttle s approach. The purpose of this presentation will be to use this case study to illustrate best practices of the human spaceflight trajectory operations team. The presentation will begin with an overview of the roles of the real-time ISS and Space Shuttle trajectory flight control teams. Then, the STS- 132 /ULF 4 case study will be used to illustrate the issues and lessons learned involved in performing <b>Space</b> Shuttle <b>rendezvous</b> maneuver planning and execution. Specific elements of the STS- 132 <b>Space</b> Shuttle <b>rendezvous</b> maneuver profile {{that can be used to}} provide mission assurance in cases of trajectory uncertainty will be described and discussed. Additionally, this case study will be used to provide context for identifying lessons learned in an operational environment that requires technical and decision-making coordination between two control center teams with two potentially maneuvering space vehicles...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the development of}} a new class of US <b>Space</b> Shuttle <b>rendezvous</b> missions which involve a maneuvering target vehicle. The objective of the analysis was to develop an operational plan to take advantage of the target spacecraft's maneuvering ability by making it responsible for a portion of the maneuvers necessary to achieve rendezvous. This work resulted in {{the development of a}} region in space relative to the Shuttle, called the control box, into which the target vehicle maneuvers. Furthermore, a mission operations plan was developed to implement the control box technique...|$|R
2500|$|The {{consequences}} {{of the rules of}} orbital mechanics are sometimes counter-intuitive. [...] For example, if two spacecraft are in the same circular orbit and wish to dock, unless they are very close, the trailing craft cannot simply fire its engines to go faster. [...] This will change the shape of its orbit, causing it to gain altitude and actually slow down relative to the leading craft, missing the target. The <b>space</b> <b>rendezvous</b> before docking normally takes multiple precisely calculated engine firings in multiple orbital periods requiring hours or even days to complete.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{most of the}} Soviet gains {{listed above}} were matched by the United States within a year, and {{sometimes}} within weeks. In 1965, the United States started to achieve many firsts (such as the first successful <b>space</b> <b>rendezvous),</b> which were important steps in a mission to the Moon. Furthermore, NASA and others say that these gains by the Soviets are not as impressive as they seem; {{that a number of}} these firsts were mere stunts that did not advance the technology greatly, or at all, e.g., the first woman in space. In fact, {{by the time of the}} launch of the first manned Earth-orbiting Apollo flight (Apollo 7), the USSR had made only nine spaceflights (seven with one cosmonaut, one with two, one with three) compared to 16 by the United States. In terms of spacecraft hours, the USSR had 460 hours of spaceflight; the United States had 1,024 hours. In terms of astronaut/cosmonaut time, the USSR had 534 hours of manned spaceflight whereas the United States had 1,992 hours. By the time of Apollo 11, the United States had a lead much wider than that. (See List of human spaceflights, 1961–1970, and refer to individual flights for the length of time.) ...|$|E

The modification allows launch and landing operations in 20 -kt crosswinds if desired. This 5 -kt increase over the previous 15 -kt limit drastically increases landing safety {{and the ability to}} make on-time launches to support missions where <b>space</b> station <b>rendezvous</b> is planned...|$|R

40|$|The {{workshops}} {{covered a}} variety of topics relevant to the identification, characterization and monitoring of near-earth solar system debris. Attention was given to man-made and naturally occurring microparticles, their hazards to present and future spacecraft, and ground- and space-based techniques for tracking both large and small debris. The studies are extended to solid fuel particulates in circular <b>space.</b> Asteroid <b>rendezvous</b> missions are discussed, including propulsion and instrumentation options, the possibility of encountering asteroids during Hohman transfer flights to Venus and/or Mars, and the benefits of multiple encounters by one spacecraft. Finally, equipment and analytical models for generating precise satellite orbits are reviewed...|$|R

50|$|After five days, {{they had}} {{performed}} four orbital adjustment burns that {{put them in}} a circular 162 nmi km orbit. This orbit would last for at least 100 days without decaying, more than stable enough for the passive target during a <b>space</b> <b>rendezvous.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{address the}} problem of {{developing}} efficient cache coherence protocols implementing distributed shared memory (DSM) using message passing. A serious drawback of traditional approaches to this problem is that designers are required to state the desired coherence protocol at the level of asynchronous message interactions. We propose a method in which designers express the desired protocol at a high-level using rendezvous communication. These descriptions are much easier to understand and computationally more efficient to verify than asynchronous protocols due to their small state <b>spaces.</b> The <b>rendezvous</b> protocol can also be synthesized into efficient asynchronous protocols. We present our protocol refinement procedure, prove its soundness, and provide examples of its efficiency. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>space</b> shuttle <b>rendezvous</b> radar has a {{requirement}} to track cooperative and non-cooperative targets. For this reason the Lunar Module (LM) Rendezvous Radar was modified {{to incorporate the}} capability of tracking a non-cooperative target. The modifications are discussed. All modifications except those relating to frequency diversity were completed, and system tests were performed to confirm proper performance in the non-cooperative mode. Frequency diversity {{was added to the}} radar and to the special test equipment, and then system tests were performed. This last set of tests included re-running the tests of the non-cooperative mode without frequency diversity, followed by tests with frequency diversity and tests of operation in the original cooperative mode...|$|R
