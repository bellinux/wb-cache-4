All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series' backstory, and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story, an in-story pirate comic titled Tales of the Black Freighter, {{which one of the}} characters reads. Structured, at times, as a nonlinear narrative, the story skips through <b>space,</b> <b>time</b> and plot.

The Glencoe-based facilities the teams had used for Close Encounters were deemed insufficient, and a nearby facility was rented and outfitted with five more stages equipped with camera tracks and systems. Dykstra and his 60-person production house Apogee Company were subcontracted to Trumbull.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recently, single-carrier {{transmission}} with frequencydomain equalization (SC-FDE) {{is attracting}} attention since the good transmission performance is achieved in a severe frequency-selective fading channel. Most {{of studies on}} SC-FDE assumed a propagation channel having sample-spaced time delays. However, the real propagation channel has fractionally <b>spaced</b> <b>time</b> delays. Under such an environment, the inter-symbol interference (ISI) is produced. In this paper, we examine, by computer simulation, the impact of fractionally <b>spaced</b> <b>time</b> delays on the bit error rate (BER) performance of SC transmission in a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel and compare it with that of OFDM.

5|$|Lie {{groups are}} of {{fundamental}} importance in modern physics: Noether's theorem links continuous symmetries to conserved quantities. Rotation, {{as well as}} translations {{in space and time}} are basic symmetries of the laws of mechanics. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description. Another example are the Lorentz transformations, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space. The latter serves—in the absence of significant gravitation—as a model of <b>space</b> <b>time</b> in special relativity. The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the Poincaré group. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for quantum field theories. Symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of gauge theory.|$|E

40|$|This project can be mainly {{divided into}} two sections. In the first section it {{attempts}} to model an irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>time</b> series data where time scale is being measured with a measurement error. Modelling an irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>time</b> series data alone is quite challenging as traditional time series techniques only capture equally/regularly <b>spaced</b> <b>time</b> series data. In addition to that, the measurement error in the time scale make it even more challenging to incorporate measurement error models and functional approaches to model the time series. Thus, this project {{is based on a}} Bayesian approach to model a flexible regression function when the time scale is being measured with a measurement error. The regression functions are modelled with regression P-splines and the exploration of posterior is carried out using a fully Bayesian method that uses Markov chain monte carlo (MCMC) techniques. In section two, we identify the relationship/dependency between two irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>time</b> series data sets which were modelled using regression P-splines and a fully Bayesian method, using windowed moving correlations. The validity of the suggested methodology is then explored using two simulations. It is then applied on two irregularly <b>spaced</b> <b>time</b> series data sets each subjected to measurement errors in time scale to identify the dependency between them in terms of statistically significant correlations...|$|R
