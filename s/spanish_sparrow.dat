5|$|The Iago sparrow {{was once}} thought to be most closely related to the rufous sparrows, a group of species within the genus Passer which live in similar {{habitats}} on continental Africa. Though the Iago sparrow is closest to the rufous sparrows in appearance, it has a number of crucial differences in morphology and behavior, and is separated by thousands of kilometres. It may in fact be more closely related to the house sparrow and <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow.</b> In Cape Verde it occurs on all but one island, and on most of them it is quite common. The Iago sparrow occurs in most habitats on available in its range, such as lava plains, rocky hills, and gorges; however, the house sparrow and <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow</b> are typically present instead in denser settlements and richer cultivated areas respectively. Because the Iago sparrow is not under any serious threats, it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|Hybridisation {{between the}} Eurasian tree sparrow {{and the house}} sparrow has been {{recorded}} {{in many parts of}} the world with male hybrids tending to resemble the Eurasian tree sparrow while females have more similarities with the house sparrow. A breeding population in the Eastern Ghats of India, said to be introduced, may also hybridise with house sparrows. On at least one occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young. A wild hybridisation with the resident sparrows of Malta, which are intermediate between the <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow</b> (P. hispaniolensis) and Italian sparrows (P. italiae), was recorded in Malta in 1975.|$|E

5|$|Nests {{are usually}} built a few metres apart in loose colonies of at most about 10 pairs, {{although}} sometimes pairs nest alone. The nest may {{be built in}} a range of habitats, and usually is built as a cup in a hole or crevice in a cliff or a wall. They may use suitable human-built structures, such as house eaves and streetlights. The nest is an open structure made of grass, lined with feathers and hairs, packed densely for compactness. Some ornithologists have reported this bird building domed nests in acacia trees, but these records may reflect confusion with the <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow.</b> The average clutch contains three to five eggs. Both sexes incubate the eggs and bring food to their young, but females do more. Eggs are incubated for short spells, around 10 minutes, and males incubate for shorter periods and less often. Though the male accompanies the female when she finds food and brings it to their nestlings, he less often brings any himself; once the young fledge and leave the nest the male is more active feeding them.|$|E
5|$|Within its genus, the Iago sparrow {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the African 'rufous sparrows', a group which also includes species such as the great sparrow (Passer motitensis). These birds were usually treated as distinct species until Reginald Ernest Moreau, writing in the 1962 Check-list of the Birds of the World, lumped the Iago sparrow and the mainland rufous sparrows as the single species Passer motitensis. This taxonomy was followed frequently until J. Denis Summers-Smith, a world authority on sparrows, argued in the 1980s that the Iago sparrow's many differences in morphology and behaviour, and separation from the other rufous sparrows by about , are sufficient grounds for species status. Studies of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA have since suggested it may be a close relative of the house sparrow and the <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow</b> and not the rufous sparrows.|$|E
5|$|Tchernov {{argued that}} the house sparrow and related species have {{undergone}} considerable morphological changes in adapting to a commensal relationship with humans, with the beak becoming longer and narrower. He wrote that P.predomesticus was intermediate between the house sparrow and <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passer hispaniolensis), and suggested {{that it may be}} a primitive relative of the ancestor of the house sparrow that did not become dependent on humans. In a 1984 paper, Tchernov suggested that the period in which the house sparrow and P.predomesticus could have separated was the Würm glaciation 70,000–10,000 years ago. Markus found that the fossil species was closest to living house sparrows from Palestine and to the great sparrow (P.motitensis), and proposed that the house sparrow evolved in Africa. In a 1977 account of the evolution of the house sparrow, American zoologists Richard F. Johnston and William J. Klitz considered that the house sparrow evolved with the beginning of agriculture, dating any fossils that could even be assigned to the common ancestor of the house and Spanish sparrows as more recent than P.predomesticus. In his 1988 work The Sparrows, British ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith considered that P.predomesticus was roughly contemporary with the common ancestor of the house and Spanish sparrows and that all present-day Palaearctic Passer species evolved later. Drawing on more recent studies of molecular data, Ted R. Anderson stated in his 2006 Biology of the Ubiquitous House Sparrow that all Passer species have a long evolutionary history, with speciation possibly occurring as early as the Miocene.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow's</b> vocalisations {{are similar}} to those of the house sparrow. The male gives a call {{somewhat}} different from that of the house sparrow when displaying at its nest. This call is a pair of strident, disyllabic chirps, similar to those of the house sparrow, but louder and high-pitched, transcribed as chweeng-chweeng, cheela-cheeli. A similar call, softer and more like the house sparrow's tschilp, is used by birds arriving or departing at roosting sites. The <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow's</b> other calls are almost the same as those of the house sparrow. A soft quer quer quer is given at the nest by mated pairs, a quer-it flight call is given by flocking birds, and a chur-chur-it call is given as a threat.|$|R
500|$|The Iago sparrow is {{endemic to}} the {{archipelago}} of Cape Verde. It is common on most islands, excluding Fogo (from {{which it is}} absent) and Santa Luzia, Branco and Sal (on which it is scarce). The Iago sparrow is found commonly {{in a variety of}} habitats, including flat lava plains, coastal cliffs, gorges, and the edges of farmland, at altitudes of up to [...] It also occurs in settled areas and gardens, where it may overlap somewhat with the house sparrow, but usually not with the <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow.</b> The <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow</b> occurs in richer cultivated land with larger trees and villages, restricting the Iago sparrow to more arid cultivated land with smaller trees. In settlements where both the house sparrow and Iago sparrow occur, house sparrows tend to occupy the denser areas, while Iago sparrows are found primarily around trees and open spaces. In agricultural areas the Iago sparrow may do some damage to crops, mostly by eating buds and shoots. The Iago sparrow is highly common within its limited range, though its exact population is not known. Though the size of its range means it may be at risk to unpredicted changes in its environment, it is assessed as Least Concern by the IUCN Red List.|$|E
500|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the house}} sparrow and its Mediterranean relatives is highly complicated. The common type of [...] "willow sparrow" [...] is the <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow,</b> which resembles the house sparrow in many respects. It frequently prefers wetter habitats than the house sparrow, and it is often colonial and nomadic. In most of the Mediterranean, one or both species occur, {{with some degree of}} hybridisation. In North Africa, the two species hybridise extensively, forming highly variable mixed populations with a full range of characters from pure house sparrows to pure Spanish sparrows.|$|E
500|$|In much of Italy, a form {{apparently}} intermediate {{between the}} house and Spanish sparrows, is known as the Italian sparrow. It resembles a hybrid between the two species, and is in other respects intermediate. Its specific status and origin are the subject of much debate. In the Alps, the Italian sparrow intergrades over a roughly [...] strip with the house sparrow, but to the south it intergrades over the southern half of Italy and some Mediterranean islands with the <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow.</b> On the Mediterranean islands of Malta, Gozo, Crete, Rhodes, and Karpathos, the other apparently intermediate birds are of unknown status.|$|E
500|$|Passer predomesticus is {{a fossil}} {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} sparrow family Passeridae. First described in 1962, it is known from two premaxillary (upper jaw) bones found in a Middle Pleistocene layer of the Oumm-Qatafa cave in Palestine. The premaxillaries resemble those {{of the house and}} <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrows,</b> but differ in having a deep groove instead of a crest on the lower side. Israeli palaeontologist Eitan Tchernov, who described the species, and others have considered it to be close to the ancestor of the house and <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrows,</b> but molecular data point to an earlier origin of modern sparrow species. Occurring in a climate Tchernov described as similar to but rainier than that in Palestine today, it was considered by Tchernov as a [...] "wild" [...] ancestor of the modern sparrows which have a commensal association with humans, although its presence in Oumm-Qatafa cave may indicate that it was associated with humans.|$|R
500|$|Premaxillae, {{the only}} bones from which Passer predomesticus is known, are {{generally}} {{relatively easy to}} determine in birds.

In P.predomesticus, there is a central, longitudinal groove with raised margins running along the lower (ventral) side of the premaxilla. In contrast, the house and <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrows</b> have a narrow crest in this position, which is more prominent in the house sparrow. In the great sparrow, Cape sparrow (Passer melanurus), and southern grey-headed sparrow (Passer diffusus), this crest is more poorly developed, and they may even have a shallow groove {{at the front of}} the premaxilla, not nearly as well-developed as the groove in P.predomesticus.

In May and June 1999 a male was observed at Bizeljsko (Kozjansko Park, spodnje Posavje, E Slovenia 160 m a. s. l.) whilepiling up nest material in the nests of House Martins Delichon urbica as well as courting and behaving territorially. On July 4 th 1999, on the other hand, a male was observed at Apače (Dravsko polje, Podravje, NE Slovenia 250 m a. s. l.) on the nest of White Stork Ciconia ciconia. Both males were in summer plumage and {{in the company of}} House Sparrows Passer domesticus. The localities are situated in a suburban village environment.

500|$|The {{house sparrow}} can be {{confused}} {{with a number of}} other seed-eating birds, especially its relatives in the genus Passer. Many of these relatives are smaller, with an appearance that is neater or [...] "cuter", as with the Dead Sea sparrow. The dull-coloured female can often not be distinguished from other females, and is nearly identical to those of the Spanish and Italian sparrows. The Eurasian tree sparrow is smaller and more slender with a chestnut crown and a black patch on each cheek. The male <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow</b> and Italian sparrow are distinguished by their chestnut crowns. The Sind sparrow is very similar but smaller, with less black on the male's throat and a distinct pale supercilium on the female.|$|E
50|$|In {{most of its}} range, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow</b> occurs {{alongside}} the house sparrow. In such areas, both species breed in farmland and open woodland, with the <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow</b> preferring moister habitats. In areas where house sparrows are absent, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow</b> may live in urban habitats, as in the Canary Islands, Madeira, and some Mediterranean islands. In a few urban areas, {{such as those in}} eastern Sardinia, the primary sparrow species is the Eurasian tree sparrow. Before the <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow</b> arrived in the Canary Islands and Madeira, the rock sparrow was the sole native sparrow. In the Canaries, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow</b> occurs in most habitats, having ousted the rock sparrow from all but the driest localities. In Madeira the <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow</b> is common in cultivated areas, but it has not fully adapted to nesting in buildings or breeding in the drier north of the island. The <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow</b> is not common on most of the Cape Verde islands, due to the presence of the endemic Iago sparrow, and the house sparrow on São Vicente. On Fogo, where it is the sole species of sparrow, it is common in all habitats, breeding both in the houses of São Filipe and on the cliff walls of the volcano Pico do Fogo.|$|E
50|$|The Italian sparrow {{has been}} {{classified}} as a hybrid with the house sparrow, the same species as the <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrow,</b> the same species as the house sparrow, and as a separate species.

40|$|BackgroundPostzygotic {{isolation}} {{in the form}} of reduced viability and/or fertility of hybrids may help maintain species boundaries in the face of interspecific gene flow. Past hybridization events between house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrows</b> (P. hispaniolensis) have given rise to a homoploid hybrid species, the Italian sparrow (P. italiae). Although genetic incompatibilities are known to isolate these three species, the biological consequences of these incompatibilities are still unknown in early generation hybrids. MethodsWe investigated whether F 1 hybrids between house and <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrows</b> experience reduced viability or fertility. More specifically, we generated hybrids through controlled crosses in aviaries, and compared ovaries of female hybrids with female of pure-species sparrows. ResultsWe found that overall, hybrid ovaries were underdeveloped and that half of all female hybrids exhibited symptoms of ovarian hypofunction (ovarian atrophy and complete absence of developed follicles). ConclusionsFertility in hybrids is a common consequence or post-zygotic barriers between species. We discuss these results in light of previous findings on genetic incompatibilities between the parent species and the potential role of incompatibilities in hybrid speciation, a rare evolutionary process in birds...|$|R

500|$|The Old World sparrow genus Passer is a {{group of}} small {{passerine}} birds that is believed to have originated in Africa, and which contains 15–25 species depending on the authority. Its members are typically found in open, lightly wooded, habitats, although several species, notably the house sparrow (P. domesticus) have adapted to human habitations. Most species in the genus are typically [...] long, predominantly brown or greyish birds with short square tails and stubby conical beaks. They are primarily ground-feeding seed-eaters, although they also consume invertebrates, especially when breeding. Genetic studies show that the Eurasian tree sparrow diverged from the other Eurasian members of its genus relatively early, before the speciation of the house, plain-backed and <b>Spanish</b> <b>sparrows.</b> The Eurasian species is not closely related to the American tree sparrow (Spizelloides arborea), which is an American sparrow.|$|R
