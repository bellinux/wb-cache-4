50|$|Ethnic {{tension between}} Croats and Serbs has {{also led to}} {{fighting}} at a football match in Australia. On 13 March 2005, Sydney United (who have a large Croatian following, and were established by Croatian immigrants) and Bonnyrigg White Eagles (who have a large Serbian following and were established by Serbian immigrants) met in Sydney in the New South Wales Premier League. About 50 fans clashed, resulting in two police officers getting injured and five fans being arrested. Football NSW held an inquiry into the events. Both clubs denied that the fight was racially motivated or {{that there was any}} ethnic rivalry.PCroatian hooligans are also notorious for staging large illegal pyroshows at stadiums, where <b>signal</b> <b>flares</b> and smoke bombs are hurled onto the pitch causing postponement or cancellation of the match. A large incident occurred in 2003 in Rome during the Hajduk-Roma match when 900 Torcida fans threw <b>signal</b> <b>flares</b> at Roma fans resulting in various injuries and clashes with the police.|$|R
50|$|A major {{difficulty}} {{faced by}} an attacking force {{in a trench}} battle was unreliable communications. Wireless communications were still in their infancy, so the available methods were telephone, telegraph, semaphore, <b>signal</b> lamps, <b>signal</b> <b>flares,</b> homing pigeons and runners. Messages frequently could not get through, or if they did, were out of date. A delay would pass when transferring news to the division, corps and army headquarters.|$|R
5000|$|A Pen gun is {{a firearm}} that resembles an ink pen. [...] They {{generally}} are of small caliber (e.g., [...]22 LR, [...]25 ACP, [...]32 ACP, [...]38-caliber, etc.) and are single shot. [...] Early examples of pen guns were pinfired, but modern designs are rim or centerfire. [...] Some pen guns are {{not designed to}} fire regular cartridges, but rather blank cartridges, <b>signal</b> <b>flares</b> or tear gas cartridges.|$|R

25|$|Subsequent {{examinations}} {{of the remains}} and personal items showed that eight of the nine airmen managed to parachute safely down to the desert from the aircraft. They then located each other by firing their revolvers and <b>signal</b> <b>flares</b> into the air. However, the ninth crewman, Bombardier Lt. John Woravka, was not found. Unknown to the survivors, it appeared his parachute only partially opened and he died from the fall.|$|R
25|$|Drifting in open {{seas and}} {{international}} waters, as encountered on long sea voyages and by military forces, requires prolonged survival in water. Suitable life jackets are often {{attached to a}} vest with pockets and attachment points for distress signaling and survival aids, for example, a handheld two-way radio (walkie-talkie), emergency beacon (406MHz frequency), signal mirror, sea marker dye, smoke or light <b>signal</b> <b>flares,</b> strobe light, first-aid supplies, concentrated nutritional items, water purification supplies, shark repellent, knife, and pistol.|$|R
25|$|In quarrying, high {{explosives}} {{are generally}} preferred for shattering rock. However, {{because of its}} low brisance, black powder causes fewer fractures and results in more usable stone compared to other explosives, making black powder useful for blasting monumental stone such as granite and marble. Black powder is well suited for blank rounds, <b>signal</b> <b>flares,</b> burst charges, and rescue-line launches. Black powder is also used in fireworks for lifting shells, in rockets as fuel, and in certain special effects.|$|R
25|$|Later on. Schmidt {{sent out}} his second-in-command—Leutnant Ernst Mössinger—to {{negotiate}} a surrender, hoping to reach favourable terms. Major Arne Sunde, the Norwegian commander, however {{refused to accept}} anything but an unconditional surrender. Sunde told Mössinger that unless the Germans announced their surrender within 10 minutes by launching three flares the British and Norwegian artillery would recommence bombarding Lindse Farm. Nine {{and a half minutes}} later, at 11:30, the Fallschirmjäger force at Lindse fired three <b>signal</b> <b>flares.</b>|$|R
50|$|A large riot {{occurred}} in 2008 in Prague {{prior to the}} Sparta Prague-Dinamo match. Riots were ignited {{with the support of}} Sparta's ultrafans to Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić. Approximately 500 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre breaking shops and attacking police with chairs, <b>signal</b> <b>flares</b> and stones. Approximately 300 Bad Blue Boys were detained and 8 police officer were injured. Prior to the riots some Bad Blue Boys provoked local Romani people by giving nazi salutes.|$|R

50|$|On {{the night}} of February 3 to 4, a single aircraft, {{shutting}} down the engines and, flying from a great height, broke through the air defense shield and dropped 3 bombs on GAZ. Wheel and engine workshops were damaged. 17 workers died, 41 were wounded. In this raid, for the first time, German agents-spotters who penetrated into Gorky were seen. They carried out target designation, launching the <b>signal</b> <b>flares</b> of red and white from the ground.|$|R

50|$|For {{nearly ten}} years, Martha Coston worked {{to develop a}} system of <b>flare</b> <b>signaling</b> based on her husband's earlier work. With a limited {{knowledge}} of chemistry and pyrotechnics, she relied {{on the advice of}} hired chemists and fireworks experts, with mixed results. A breakthrough came in 1858, while she was witnessing the fireworks display in New York City celebrating the completion of the transatlantic telegraph cable; she realized that her system needed a bright blue flare, along with the red and white she had already developed. She established the Coston Manufacturing Company to manufacture the <b>signal</b> <b>flares,</b> and entered into a business relationship with a pyrotechnics developer to provide the necessary blue color.|$|R
25|$|The {{player can}} engage enemies {{in a variety}} of ways; using stealth or aggression, bullets or {{non-lethal}} tranquilizers, ranged rifles or short-range weaponry, and so on. Enemy soldiers employ tactical maneuvers and work as squads. All soldiers will respond to noise caused by the player, including using <b>signal</b> <b>flares</b> to call for reinforcements. If the player has not been detected in the area, enemies will exhibit relaxed behaviour, but if aware of the player they will draw weapons and become combative.|$|R
50|$|While Jim and Drake try {{to repair}} the {{aircraft}}, Chester Gimble tries {{to call for help}} and fires off a <b>signal</b> <b>flare,</b> that lands in a nearby bush and sets it on fire. The fire comes closer and threatens them all, but soon the aircraft is ready to fly. Drake and the Karoleks try to commandeer the flight and a struggle ensues. In the end, Riley shoots and kills Drake. They all board the aircraft and Jim is able to take off.|$|R
5|$|Since NASA's Space Shuttle {{program had}} not been launched, Derek Meddings and his miniatures team had to create the rocket launch footage without any reference. Shuttle models {{attached}} to bottle rockets and <b>signal</b> <b>flares</b> were used for take-off, and the smoke trail was created with salt that fell from the models. The space scenes were done by rewinding the camera after an element was shot, enabling other elements to be superimposed in the film stock, with the space battle needing up to forty rewinds to incorporate everything.|$|R
50|$|Another {{incident}} occurred in Genoa in 2007 when masked Torcida fans attacked the police with bricks, bottles and stones. Rioting {{continued in the}} stadium when Torcida fans threw chairs into the pitch and made nazi salutes. A riot occurred in 2006 in Osijek during the Osijek-Dinamo match. Several clashes between the Bad Blue Boys and Kohorta occurred before the match in which one Osijek fan received several stab wounds after which Osijek fans attacked the police and Dinamo fans with <b>signal</b> <b>flares</b> and stones.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of January 31, 1968, a division-sized force of PAVN and Vietcong {{soldiers}} launched a coordinated attack on the city of Huế. At 02:33, a <b>signal</b> <b>flare</b> lit up the night sky, and two battalions from the PAVN 6th Regiment attacked the western wall of the Citadel. Their objective was to capture the Mang Ca Garrison, headquarters of Brigadier General Ngo Quang Truong’s 1st ARVN Infantry Division in the northeast corner of the citadel. Other objectives included the Tây Lộc Airfield, and the Imperial Palace.|$|R
25|$|On 8 January 2016, two {{suspected}} militants, {{armed with}} a melee weapon and a <b>signal</b> <b>flare,</b> allegedly arrived by sea and stormed the Bella Vista Hotel in the Red Sea city of Hurghada, stabbing two foreign tourists from Austria and one from Sweden. (Early reports incorrectly stated that the victims were one German and one Danish national.) One of the attackers, 21-year-old student Mohammed Hassan Mohammed Mahfouz, was killed by the security personnel. The other attacker was injured. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility.|$|R
