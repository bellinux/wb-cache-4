40|$|Abstract In recent years, {{with the}} {{development}} of mobile communication technologies and the increase of available wireless transmission bandwidth, deploying multimedia services in next generation mobile IPv 6 networks has become an inevitable trend. RSVP (resource reservation protocol) proposed by the IETF is designed for hardwired and fixed networks and can not be used in mobile environments. This paper proposes a protocol, called Fast RSVP, to reserve resources for mobile IPv 6. The protocol adopts a cross-layer design approach where two modules (RSVP module and Mobile IPv 6 module) at different layers cooperate with each other. Fast RSVP divides a handover process with QoS guarantees into two stages: (1) setup of the resource reservation neighbor tunnel and (2) resource reservation on the optimized route. It can help a mobile node realize fast handover with QoS guarantees as well as avoid resource wasting by triangular routes, advanced reservations and duplicate reservations. In addition, fast RSVP reserves “guard channels ” for handover sessions, thus greatly reducing the handover <b>session</b> forced <b>termination</b> rate while maintaining high performance of the net-work. Based on extensive performance analysis and simulations, Fast RSVP, compared with existing methods of resource reservation in mobile environments, performs better in terms of packet delay and throughput during handover, QoS recovery time after handover, resource reservation cost, handover <b>session</b> forced <b>termination</b> rate and overall session completion rate...|$|R

40|$|Managing the {{performance}} of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server under heavy load conditions is a critical task in a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) network. In this paper, a two-tier model is proposed for the security, load mitigation, and distribution issues of the SIP server. In the first tier, the proposed handler segregates and drops the malicious traffic. The second tier provides a uniform load of distribution, using the least <b>session</b> <b>termination</b> time (LSTT) algorithm. Besides, the mean <b>session</b> <b>termination</b> time is minimized by reducing the waiting time of the SIP messages. Efficiency of the LSTT algorithm is evaluated through the experimental test bed by considering with and without a handler. The experimental results establish that the proposed two-tier model improves the throughput and the CPU utilization. It also reduces the response time and error rate while preserving the quality of multimedia session delivery. This two-tier model provides robust security, dynamic load distribution, appropriate server selection, and session synchronization...|$|E
40|$|Single-sign-on (SSO) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a more efficient and convenient authentication method.

Thus, in a SSO based system, robust persistent authentications and secure <b>session</b> <b>termination</b> management are vital for ensuring secure operations.

Significance and viability of these methods are demonstrated by security, complexity and numerical analyses.

40|$|Aiming at the {{features}} of wireless mobile communication, this paper proposes a new resource reservation scheme, Fast RSVP (resource reservation protocol), to guarantee the QoS of sessions for mobile IPv 6. The scheme adopts cross-layer design, it cooperates two modules at different layers: Mobile IP module and RSVP module.

Fast RSVP imports a series of new mechanisms such as advanced resource reservation on neighbor tunnels, resource reservation on optimized routes, resource reservation for handover sessions, path merging etc. Simulation results show that Fast RSVP scheme, compared with other traditional RSVP extensions for mobile environments, has the following advantages: (1) it realizes a mobile node handover with QoS guarantees; (2) it avoids resource wasting caused by triangular routes and duplicate reservations in mobile IP handover process; (3) it distinguishes different types of reservation requests, greatly reducing the handover <b>session</b> forced <b>termination</b> rate while maintaining high performance of the network. 12 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — With a wide {{spread of}} {{smartphones}} and tablets, a mobile network becomes frequently congested when many users concentrate to the same place. Especially when a large-scale event is held, a heavy network congestion interferes with the communication of the participants as well as local residents. In order to detect the network congestion, a large amount of traffic log should be analyzed in real time. In this paper, the proposed system attempts to detect a sign of the congestion by using a CEP (Complex Event Processing). First, by analyzing network status when the large-scale event, Nagaoka Fireworks festival, is held, it is observed that the network congestion can be effectively detected from the combination of (1) the RTT, (2) the specific type of TCP <b>session</b> <b>termination</b> (FIN-No-ACK) and (3) the number of retransmission packets. Next, we develop our proposed congestion detection system by using a CEP for detecting these metric in real-time.

CXPST extends previous work that demonstrates a vulnerability in routers that allows an adversary to disconnect a pair of routers using only data plane traffic. By carefully choosing BGP sessions to terminate, CXPST generates a surge of BGP updates that are seen by nearly all core routers on the Internet. This surge of updates surpasses the computational capacity of affected routers, crippling their ability to make routing decisions. In this paper we show how an adversary can attack multiple BGP sessions simultaneously and measure the impact these session failures have on the control plane of the Internet. We directly simulate the BGP activity resulting from this attack and compute the impact those messages have on router processing loads. Through simulations we show that botnets {{on the order of}} 250, 000 nodes can increase processing delays from orders of microseconds to orders of hours. We also propose and validate a defense against CXPST. Through simulation we demonstrate that current defenses are insufficient to stop CXPST.

Traditional telephony {{services such as}} voice and video real-time communication will be provided {{through the use of}} IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) Multimedia Telephony (MTSI) which imposes high demands on the transport channel. In a packet switched network any intermediary node can act like a congestion bottle neck leading to delay or packet loss. In this scenario a fast end to end adaptation scheme at the media layer can play a vital role to secure service performance by ensuring high quality throughout the session, even in extreme conditions, and keeps the service alive avoiding <b>session</b> <b>termination.</b> This thesis report describes a study of perceived video quality improvement using end to end congestion control depending on both “pre-warning” for congestion and packet loss observed at receiver in IMS video telephony over 3 GPP LTE system according to 3 GPP TS 26. 114 V 7. 0. 0.

VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) {{refers to}} a {{communication}} mechanism in which voice and/or multimedia maybe transmitted over the internet {{in the form of}} digitized packets. VoIP quickly became an important part of digital communication and audio engineering discipline because of its versatility to support various features. It advanced tremendously {{over the last few years}} mainly because of the internet boom, cost benefits and the flexibility of communication that it offered over the internet. Depending on their implementations, VoIP sessions can use a wide variety of protocols to establish and terminate sessions. Based on the type of application or scenario in which VoIP is used, the speech signal can be encoded and decoded using different standard codecs before they are transmitted over the network as packets. The main aim of the project was to design a billing system and write Java code to enable VoIP communication between two computer systems using SIP protocol. This project used open source sip-communicator based code as the main framework to implement VoIP communication. At the Application layer, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) controlled Signaling (including session initiation, <b>session</b> <b>termination)</b> and communication sessions while Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) defined the format for voice/media data over the Internet. This project also used two test accounts created on a back end SIP server to test the VoIP implementation and transmission in real time.

The body weight criterion used {{to decide if}} a hen was {{to be placed in}} an experimental session differed across conditions, to determine if this would affect performance, using wheat and puffed wheat as reinforcers in different conditions. In the first experiment the hens were maintained by post-session feeding at 80 ± 5 % of their free-feeding body weights. In Conditions 1 and 2 the hens were placed in a session even when they were more than 5 % above the target weight. In Conditions 3 and 4 they were placed in a session if their body weight was within the specified range, meaning there could be several days between sessions. There were clear differences resulting from food type, both in behaviour under the fixed ratio schedules, and in the resulting demand functions (with consumption measured as either number of reinforcers or weight of food obtained). Wheat resulted in lower overall response rates than puffed wheat at low fixed ratio values. The body weight criterion did not result in large effects on performance, however, the more relaxed body weight criterion gave a higher essential value for puffed wheat than for wheat (replicating Foster et al., 2009), whereas, the strict body weight criterion gave a lower essential value for puffed wheat than for wheat under the analysis proposed by Hursh and Silberberg (2008) and using number of reinforcers as the consumption measure. A second experiment replicated Jackson (2011), using the same two foods, strict body weight criteria and sessions which terminated after 40 reinforcers or 40 -min. The resulting data were similar to Jackson (2011), who found similar performance for both foods. The difference between the demand functions for the two foods, with reinforcer rate as the consumption measure, were greatly reduced in comparison to Experiment 1. The essential value of the two foods was not consistently different across hens. These results suggest that the <b>session</b> <b>termination</b> criterion did affect demand...|$|E
