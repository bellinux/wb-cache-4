40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to define factors that {{influence}} the emergence of induced i. e. generated traffic for experts involved in highway feasibility studies. An explanation of the practical methods for forecasting generated traffic is done by reviewing international experiences in the relevant literature. Also, the idea underlying this paper is to explain the different treatments of generated traffic in evaluating highway projects with no tolls, which is based on socio-economic aspects versus the evaluation of highway projects with tolls, which is based on financial aspects. Finally, we propose that since it is hard to measure the economic benefits from indirect effects (in the evaluation of socio-economic aspects) the evaluators could determine the economic benefits of the generated traffic using the same procedure as for normal traffic.

40|$|Digital {{convergence}} enables {{firms in}} the computing, communications, and electronic consumer industries to design and launch multifunctional converged products. This presents firms with a significant opportunity for value creation and profit growth. At the same time, the increased substitutability between products supplied by different industry segments heightens competition and poses a significant threat of margin erosion. These conflicting incentives {{make it difficult for}} firms in converging industries to make strategic product line and product design decisions. In our study, we analyze the technological, product, and market factors that have an impact on these decisions and derive conditions under which it is (and is not) optimal for firms to launch converged products that combine the functionalities of products in two different industries. We find that the optimality of including converged products in the product line depends crucially on the synergies arising out of functionality colocation. Further, as technology permits higher levels of product convergence, converged products relegate specialized products to narrow market niches, even when there is some quality degradation from functionality colocation. Overall production and total firm profits tend to increase, although the impact on consumer <b>surplu...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the demand for}} hockey game trips among metropolitan and non-metropolitan residents of Alberta, Canada. Using data on both revealed and stated preference game trip behaviour from a telephone survey conducted throughout Alberta, we estimate the effect of ticket prices, team quality, arena amenities, and capacity on the latent demand for NHL hockey. We find that lower ticket prices, higher team quality and additional capacity encourage attendance. The base case consumer surplus per game is $ 50 {{for those who had}} attended hockey games and about 50 % less for those who had not attended games. Exploiting the stated preference data, we develop a number of other consumer surplus estimates. We also include travel costs in the estimation of the demand function and estimate the full value of the game trip considering both ticket prices and travel costs. Sold out arenas in Calgary and Edmonton generate annual consumption benefits of $ 40 and $ 35 million. Considering the full price consumer surplus for the Calgary Flames of $ 103 per game trip, the annual consumption benefits may be as high as $ 82 million.

40|$|In recent times, rapid {{advances}} {{in the field of}} information technology have enabled firms selling information products (for example, {{in the form of a}} CD) to provide subscription services using remote servers. Making the product versus service decision involves a trade-off. Online subscription offerings are perceived to be of lower quality because of data security and network reliability issues but can reduce or even eliminate the credible commitment (of prices) problem typically faced by firms selling durable products. We model an infinite horizon game between two symmetric firms that choose the design architecture, that is, product or service (and consequent contracting scheme: selling or subscription) and then set prices to optimize profits. The perceived quality loss enables firms to differentiate based on design architecture/contracting scheme and make positive profits. Further, the firm that sells a product makes higher profit than the firm that offers a subscription service. However, as the discount factor increases, the presence of a seller leads to a credible commitment problem for both firms leading to a reduction in prices. The results offer an explanation for the persistence of firms selling products rather than services. Further, a firm offering a subscription service may be subject to price pressure due to the price commitment issues of a competing seller. We also extend our insights to other settings: one involving asymmetric firms and the other involving different discount rates for product quality and producer/consumer <b>surplu...</b>|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a theoretical analysis {{of how the}} processes of industri-alization and development interact with international trade in goods or services to influence a country’s turning point from labor exporter to labor importer. It is concluded that trade in goods complements capital move-ments but substitutes for labor movements, whereas trade in services and labor movements complement each other. The proposed analytical frame-work suggests that both international trade and migration may contribute to, but cannot lead to, a development process that brings about a migration transition in surplus labor economies. The process of industrialization and development {{is associated with a}} structural transformation of economies. In a long term perspective, the most important dimension of such transformations is a structural change in the composition of output and employment over time. To begin with, the share of the agricultural sector in both output and employment is over-whelmingly large. As industrialization proceeds, the share of the manufac-turing sector, and later the services sector, in output and in employment rises, while that of the agricultural sector falls. The absorption of surplus labor is reflected in the migration of unemployed or underemployed workers from rural hinterlands to urban settlements. Given the massive differences in employment probabilities and wage levels, wherever possi-ble, migration of workers across national boundaries also absorbs a part of the labor surplus. Over time, the process of economic development is associated with a migration transition. Rural-urban migration comes to an end when the surplus of labor in the subsistence sector is exhausted.

40|$|Mineral {{phosphorus}} (P) fertilizers processed from fossil reserves have enhanced {{food production}} {{over the past}} 50 years and, hence, the welfare of billions of people. Fertilizer P has, however, not only been used to lift the fertility level of formerly poor soils, but also allowed people to neglect the reuse of P that humans ingest {{in the form of}} food and excrete again as faeces and urine and also in other organic wastes. Consequently, P mainly moves in a linear direction from mines to distant locations for crop production, processing and consumption, where a large fraction eventually may become either agronomically inactive due to over-application, unsuitable for recycling due to fixation, contamination or dilution, and harmful as a polluting agent of surface water. This type of P use is not sustainable because fossil phosphate rock reserves are finite. Once the high quality phosphate rock reserves become depleted, too little P will be available for the soils of food-producing regions that still require P supplements to facilitate efficient utilization of resources other than P, including other nutrients. The paper shows that the amounts of P applied in agriculture could be considerably smaller by optimizing land use, improvement of fertilizer recommendations and application techniques, modified livestock diets, and adjustment of livestock densities to available land. Such a concerted set of measures is expected to reduce the use of P in agriculture whilst maintaining crop yields and minimizing the environmental impact of P losses. The paper also argues that compensation of the P exported from farms should eventually be fully based on P recovered from ‘wastes’, the recycling of which should be stimulated by policy measures.

40|$|Abstract. Following [18], {{we study}} the {{adjustment}} coefficient of ruin theory {{in a context}} of temporal dependency. We provide a consistent estimator of this coefficient, and perform some simulations. Adjustment coefficient w for risk processes may describe the behavior of ruin probability. Several results for sums of i. i. d. claims exist: in [12], H. U. Gerber gave an exact formula for finite time ruin probabilities involving the adjustment coefficient w, [19] provide a consistent estimator of w, V. Mammisch [15] gave a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of w. In dependent contexts, let us cite H. U. Gerber [13] for auto-regressive processes, [2] for an extension to ARMA processes and [3, 4] {{for the study of the}} adjustment coefficients in Markovian environments. The main objective of the parper is to provide a non parametric estimation of the adjustement coefficient introduced in [18] in dependent contexts. We give a general dependent context (weak temporal dependency in the sense of [7]) for which our estimator is consistent. The paper is organized as follows: • Section 1 contains the definitions and elementary properties of weakdependent processes as well as adjustment coefficient. To make short, wi, the independent coefficient, will be the adjustment coefficient if the process is i. i. d. while wd will be the adjustment coefficient of a dependent sequence. • In Section 2, we prove that wd may be seen as a limit (for r → ∞) of independent coefficients wi r. We also provide some general examples for which the adjustment coefficient wd may be defined. • Section 3 is devoted to the estimation of coefficients wi and wd and contains the main results: we construct consistent estimators (see Theorems 3. 3, 3. 5 and 3. 10). Note that in [2], an estimation of wd is given for ARMA processes which is based on the estimation of the ARMA parameters. Our procedure is completely non parametric. • In Section 4 we provide some simulations. 1. Setting We consider (Yn) n∈N a sequence of random variables and Ru the event {Yn> u for some n ≥ 1 }.
