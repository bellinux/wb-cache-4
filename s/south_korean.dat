5|$|In January 1953, IX Corps was reorganized for {{the last}} time and now {{consisted}} entirely of <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> forces. It retained command of the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> 3rd Infantry Division and Capital Division, and gained command of the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> 9th Infantry Division. The corps maintained a position around Chorwon, flanked to the west by I Corps and to the east by the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> II Corps. Though the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> II Corps saw a major attack against its lines in July 1953, IX Corps and its divisions only fought in limited engagements, usually with company-sized formations attacking or defending fortified positions against the Chinese {{until the end of the}} war. No major attacks against the corps were conducted through 1953, until the armistice was signed in July, ending the war.|$|E

50|$|As of 2011 about 50,000 Koreans {{reside in}} Shanghai. According to 2006 {{estimates}} about 85,000 Joseonjok (ethnic Koreans who are Chinese citizens) live in Shanghai. As of 2013 over 19,800 <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> are resident in Shanghai.

50|$|The busy {{lifestyle}} of modern <b>South</b> <b>Koreans,</b> leading to difficulties in mediating vacations with family or friends, {{and the increase}} in one-person households, have contributed to the growing number of <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> traveling alone. Therefore, the popularity of destinations close to South Korea, where <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> can go for short vacations alone, are increasing. According to the results of a plane ticket analysis in 2016, the top foreign destination for <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> is Osaka, followed by Bangkok and Tokyo. Moreover, Osaka, Tokyo, and Shanghai have high re-visit rates for <b>South</b> <b>Koreans.</b> However European destinations such as London, Paris, and Rome have fallen in re-visit rating, due to geographical distances, expensive air fares and high costs.|$|R
25|$|Most Japanese Prime Ministers {{have issued}} apologies, {{including}} Prime Minister Obuchi in the Japan–South Korea Joint Declaration of 1998. While <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> welcomed the apologies at the time, many <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> now view the statements as insincere, because of continuous misunderstandings {{between the two}} nations. In one example in 2005, the Koizumi Cabinet did not participate, but 47 Diet members visited Yasukuni shrine for a memorial service {{at exactly the same}} time Prime Minister Koizumi was issuing the apology. This was seen by <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> as a contradiction and has caused many <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> to distrust Japanese statements of apology.|$|R
5|$|On {{the night}} of June 25, 1950, 10 {{divisions}} of the North Korean army launched a full-scale invasion of South Korea. Advancing with 89,000men in six columns, the North Koreans caught the disorganized, ill-equipped, and unprepared <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> army by surprise and routed them. North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance, pushing steadily down the peninsula against the opposing 38,000 front-line <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> men. The majority of the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> forces retreated {{in the face of}} the invasion, and by June 28 the North Koreans had captured the southern capital, Seoul, and forced the government and its shattered forces to withdraw southward.|$|E

The <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> civilians were evacuated in 1976, while General Rhee and two other diplomats were held captive until April 1980. A group of Americans were also left behind or chose the remain in Saigon, 38 of them, together with their dependents, were evacuated to Bangkok on 1 August 1976.|$|E
5|$|The goal of American {{armed forces}} was to {{reinforce}} {{the remnants of the}} <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> Army (ROK) in fighting back the North Korean invasion (but only in the southeastern part of South Korea, around the major seaport of Pusan) to prevent the complete collapse of the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> Army and of the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> Government. However, the American armed forces in the Orient had been decreasing steadily since the end of World War II, by mid-1950, there were no American troops in South Korea, and the American force in Japan had dwindled drastically.|$|E

5|$|Though it was {{steadily}} pushed back, <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> {{forces on}} the right flank increased their resistance further south hoping to delay North Korean units as much as possible. North and <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> units sparred for control of several cities, inflicting heavy casualties on one another. The Republic of Korea Army forces defended Yongdok fiercely before being forced back. They also performed well in the Battle of Andong, forcing the NK 12th Division to delay their attacks on P'ohang-dong until the early August. The <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> forces had also undergone significant reorganizations, and after receiving {{a large number of}} recruits by 26 July, the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> Army had reached an effective strength of 85,871 men.|$|E
5|$|UN troops, {{particularly}} <b>South</b> <b>Korean,</b> {{were also}} {{accused of killing}} or attempting to kill captured North Korean soldiers. <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> civilians, {{some of whom were}} leftist or communist sympathizers, were known to have been systematically imprisoned or killed in the Bodo League massacres, some of which have taken place during the battle. In the years since the fight, evidence has also surfaced indicating that the US military killed <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> civilians shortly before the fight along the Pusan Perimeter began, fearing them North Korean infiltrators, in the No Gun Ri massacre. The evidence is debated but several books have been published on the matter.|$|E
5|$|US losses {{during the}} battle were {{extremely}} light; unusual for fighting {{at a time in}} which other UN offensive forces were paying a heavy price when making similar pushes against the North Korean troops. The US infantry forces suffered only five killed and 54 wounded in the 27th Infantry, plus three killed and 16 wounded in the 23rd Infantry. This brought the total American casualty count to 8 dead, 70 wounded. <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> troops suffered much more heavily during the fight. An estimated 2,300 <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> men were killed in the fighting; 2,244 enlisted men and 56 officers. However, these losses were not crippling, as volunteers poured in from the surrounding countryside to fight for the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> Army.|$|E
