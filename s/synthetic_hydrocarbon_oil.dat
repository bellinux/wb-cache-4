50|$|The dampers {{are filled}} with magnetorheological fluid, a mixture of easily {{magnetized}} iron particles in a <b>synthetic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>oil.</b> In each of the monotube dampers is a piston containing two electromagnetic coils and two small fluid passages through the piston. The electromagnets are {{able to create a}} variable magnetic field across the fluid passages. When the magnets are off, the fluid travels through the passages freely. However, when the magnets are turned on, the iron particles in the fluid create a fibrous structure through the passages in the same direction of the magnetic field. The strength of the bonds between the magnetized iron particles causes the viscosity of the fluid to increase resulting in a stiffer suspension. Altering the strength of the current results in an instantaneous change in force of the piston. If the sensors sense any body roll, they communicate the information to the ECU. The ECU will compensate for this by changing the strength of the current to the appropriate dampers.|$|E

40|$|An {{intermetallic}} nickel-titanium alloy, NITINOL 60 (60 NiTi), containing 60 wt% {{nickel and}} 40 wt% titanium, {{is shown to}} be a promising candidate material for oil-lubricated rolling and sliding contact applications such as bearings and gears. NiTi alloys are well known and normally exploited for their shape memory behavior. When properly processed, however, NITINOL 60 exhibits excellent dimensional stability and useful structural properties. Processed via high temperature, high-pressure powder metallurgy techniques or other means, NITINOL 60 offers a broad combination of physical properties that make it unique among bearing materials. NITINOL 60 is hard, electrically conductive, highly corrosion resistant, less dense than steel, readily machined prior to final heat treatment, nongalling and nonmagnetic. No other bearing alloy, metallic or ceramic encompasses all of these attributes. Further, NITINOL 60 has shown remarkable tribological performance when compared to other aerospace bearing alloys under oil-lubricated conditions. Spiral orbit tribometer (SOT) tests were conducted in vacuum using NITINOL 60 balls loaded between rotating 440 C stainless steel disks, lubricated with <b>synthetic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>oil.</b> Under conditions considered representative of precision bearings, the performance (life and friction) equaled or exceeded that observed with silicon nitride or titanium carbide coated 440 C bearing balls. Based upon this preliminary data, it appears that NITINOL 60, despite its high titanium content, is a promising candidate alloy for advanced mechanical systems requiring superior and intrinsic corrosion resistance, electrical conductivity and nonmagnetic behavior under lubricated contacting conditions...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{availability}} {{has always}} been an essential component of human civilization and the energetic consumption is directly linked to the produced wealth. In many depressed countries the level of solar radiation is considerably high and it could be the primary energy source under conditions that low cost, simple-to-be-used technologies are employed. Then, it is responsibility of the most advanced countries to develop new equipments to allow this progress for taking place. A large part of the energetic forecast, based on economic projection for the next decades, ensure us that fossil fuel supplies will be largely enough to cover the demand. The predicted and consistent increase in the energetic demand will be more and more covered by a larger use of fossil fuels, without great technology innovations. A series of worrying consequences are involved in the above scenario: important climatic changes are linked to strong CO 2 emissions; sustainable development is hindered by some problems linked to certainty of oil and natural gas supply; problems of global poverty are not solved but amplified by the unavoidable increase in fossil fuel prices caused by an increase in demand. These negative aspects can be avoided only if a really innovative and more acceptable technology will be available in the next decades at a suitable level to impress a substantial effect on the society. Solar energy is the ideal candidate to break this vicious circle between economic progress and consequent greenhouse effect. The low penetration on the market shown today by the existent renewable technologies, solar energy included, is explained by well-known reasons: the still high costs of the produced energy and the “discontinuity” of both solar and wind energies. These limitations must be removed in reasonable short times, with the support of innovative technologies, in view of such an urgent scenario. On this purpose ENEA, {{on the basis of the}} Italian law n. 388 / 2000, has started an R&D program addressed to the development of CSP (Concentrated Solar Power) systems able to take advantage of solar energy as heat source at high temperature. One of the most relevant objectives of this research program (Rubbia, 2001) is the study of CSP systems operating in the field of medium temperatures (about 550 °C), directed towards the development of a new and low-cost technology to concentrate the direct radiation and efficiently convert solar energy into high temperature heat; another aspect is focused on the production of hydrogen by means of thermo-chemical processes at temperatures above 800 °C. As well as cost reductions, the current innovative ENEA conception aims to introduce a set of innovations, concerning: i) The parabolic-trough solar collector: an innovative design to reduce production costs, installation and maintenance and to improve thermal efficiency is defined in collaboration with some Italian industries; ii) The heat transfer fluid: the <b>synthetic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>oil,</b> which is flammable, expensive and unusable beyond 400 °C, is substituted by a mixture of molten salts (sodium and potassium nitrate), widely used in the industrial field and chemically stable up to 600 °C; iii) The thermal storage (TES) : it allows for the storage of solar energy, which is then used when energy is not directly available from the sun (night and covered sky) (Pilkington, 2000). After some years of R&D activities, ENEA has built an experimental facility (defined within the Italian context as PCS, “Prova Collettori Solari”) at the Research Centre of Casaccia in Rome (ENEA, 2003), which incorporates the main proposed innovative elements. The next step is to test these innovations at full scale by means of a demonstration plant, as envisioned by the “Archimede” ENEA/ENEL Project in Sicily. Such a project is designed to upgrade the ENEL thermo-electrical combined-cycle power plant by about 5 MW, using solar thermal energy from concentrating parabolic-trough collectors. Particularly, the Chapter will focus on points i) and iii) above: - loads, actions, and more generally, the whole design procedure for steel components of parabolic-trough solar concentrators will be considered in agreement with the Limit State method, as well as a new approach will be critically and carefully proposed to use this method in designing and testing “special structures” such as the one considered here; - concrete tanks durability under prolonged thermal loads and temperature variations will be estimated by means of an upgraded F. E. coupled model for heat and mass transport (plus mechanical balance). The presence of a surrounding soil volume will be additionally accounted for to evaluate environmental risk scenarios. Specific technological innovations will be considered, such as: -higher structural safety related to the reduced settlements coming from the chosen shape of the tank (a below-grade cone shape storage); - employment of HPC containment structures and foundations characterized by lower costs with respect to stainless steel structures; - substitution of highly expensive corrugated steel liners with plane liners taking advantage of the geometric compensation of thermal dilations due to the conical shape of the tank; - possibility of employing freezing passive systems for the concrete basement made of HPC, able to sustain temperature levels higher than those for OPC; - fewer problems when the tank is located on low-strength soils...|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{gear box}} {{lubricants}} typically are <b>hydrocarbon</b> based mineral <b>oils</b> with considerable amounts of additives {{to overcome the}} lack of base fluid properties like wear protection, oxidation stability, load carrying capacity, low temperature solidification and drop of viscosity at higher temperatures. For today's wind turbine gearboxes, the requirements are more severe and <b>synthetic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>oils</b> are used to improve on this, but all such hydrocarbon based lubricants require significant amounts of Extreme Pressure (EP) additives to meet performance requirements. Perfluoropolyether (PFPE) fluids provide load carrying capacity as an inherent property. During {{the course of the}} project with the main tasks of 'Establish a Benchmark', 'Lubricant Evaluation', 'Full Scale Gearbox Trial' and 'Economic Evaluation', the PAO Reference oil exhibited significant changes after laboratory gear testing, in service operation in the field and full scale gearbox trial. Four <b>hydrocarbon</b> base <b>oils</b> were selected for comparison in the benchmarking exercise and showed variation with respect to meeting the requirements for the laboratory micro-pitting tests, while the PFPE fluid exceeded the requirements even with the material taken after the full scale gear box trial. This is remarkable for a lubricant without EP additives. Laboratory bearing tests performed on the PFPE fluids before and after the full scale gear box trial showed the results met requirements for the industry standard. The PFPE fluid successfully completed the full scale gear box test program which included baseline and progressive staged load testing. The evaluation of gears showed no micro-pitting or objectionable wear. By the final stage, lubricant film thickness had been reduced to just 21 % of its original value, this was by design and resulted in a lambda ratio of well below 1. This test design scenario of a low lambda ratio is a very undesirable lubrication condition for real world but creates the ability to test the lubricating fluids performance under the most extreme conditions. The PAO Reference oil also passed its testing without any noticeable deterioration of the gear surface. However the PAO Reference oil was replaced midway through the progressive loading, as the lubricant was burned in an attempt to raise the sump temperature to the same levels as for the PFPE. Both materials experienced a decrease of viscosity during their respective run times. The viscosity index decreased for the PAO there while there was a slight increase for the PFPE. FZG laboratory gear tests and measurements of the drive motor's current during the full scale gear box trial were made to characterize the relative efficiency between the PFPE fluid and the PAO Reference oil. In the FZG laboratory efficiency test, the PFPE fluids show much higher churning losses due to their higher viscosity and density. The analysis seems to show that the efficiency correlates better to dynamic viscosity than any other of the measured metrics such as film thickness. In load stages where the load, speed and temperature are similar, the PFPE fluid has a greater film thickness and theoretical gear protection, but requires a larger current for the drive motor than the PAO. However in load stages where the film thickness is the same, the PFPE fluid's reduced dynamic viscosity gives it a slight efficiency advantage relative to the PAO reference oil. Ultimately, many factors such as temperature, rotational speed, and fluid viscosity combine in a complex fashion to influence the results. However, the PFPE's much lower change of viscosity with respect to temperature, allows variations in designing an optimum viscosity to balance efficiency versus gear protection. Economic analysis was done using Cost of Energy calculations. The results vary from 5. 3 % for a 'Likely Case' to 16. 8 % for a 'Best Case' scenario as potential cost improvement by using PFPE as the gearbox lubricating fluid. It is important to note the largest portion of savings comes in Levelized Replacement Cost, which is dictated by the assumption on gearbox reliability. Thus, verifying and quantifying the potential of PFPE fluid to effect gearbox reliability is the key assumption that would need to be further validated. In summary the proof of concept to use PFPE fluid as wind turbine gear box lubricant was validated with this project. The increase in life time was qualitatively demonstrated and this supports the need for future activity of field trials and laboratory aging studies to quantify the predicted 20 year life. With micro-pitting being the major failure mechanism in the last years, recent publications show that white etch cracking of bearings seem to have the highest impact on wind turbine reliability. With its higher film thicknesses compared to PAO reference oils, PFPE fluids have the potential to reduce this failure occurrence as well...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Bearings {{in field}} {{applications}} with high dynamic loading, e. g. wind energy plants, suffer from sudden failure initiated by subsurface material transformation, known as white etching cracks {{in a typical}} scale of µm, preferably around the maximum Hertzian stress zone. Despite many investigations in this field no precise knowledge about {{the root cause of}} those failures is available, {{due to the fact that}} failure under real service conditions of wind energy plants differs from what is known from test rig results in terms of contact loading, lubrication or dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to apply Barkhausen noise measurement to a full bearing test ring running under conditions of elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) with high radial preload. Design/methodology/approach: Full bearing tests are carried out by use of DGBB (Deep Grove Ball Bearings) with 6206 specification, material set constant as 100 Cr 6, martensitic hardening, 10 - 12 percent maximum retained austenite and radial preload of 3500 ?MPa. Speed is set 9000 ?rpm, temperature is self setting at 80 °C by test conditions. For tests, <b>synthetic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> base <b>oil</b> (Poly-a-Olefine) with a 1 percent amount of molydenum-dithiophosphate (organic chain given as 2 -ethylhexyl) was used. Findings: Non-destructive fractal dimension analyses by use of Barkhausen noise measurements is of versatile value in terms of recording bearing manufacturing processes, but can also be part of non-destructive condition monitoring of bearings in field applications, where predictive reactive maintenance is crucial for availability of the plant. Research limitations/implications: Barkhausen noise signal recording may also be valuable for case studies related to microstructure changes of steel under operation conditions. Bearings are exposed in plenty of conditions to phenomena such as straying currents, subsequently straying magnetic fields. Hardly anything is known about how microstructure of bearing steel is susceptible to such conditions. This will be part of further studies. Originality/value: Results given in the paper show that sudden bearing failure, according to formation of subsurface material property changes might be driven by activities of dislocations. Since those activities start with sequences of stress field-induced formation of domains, later by formation of low-angle subgrains, and at least phase transformation, recording of the Barkhausen signal would lead to real predictive condition monitoring in applications where a highly dynamic loading of the contact, even with low nominal contact pressure leads to sudden failure induced by white etching...|$|R
