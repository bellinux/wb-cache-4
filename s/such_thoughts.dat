It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing {{that if an}} individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution. Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind <b>such</b> <b>thoughts</b> vary within New Age literature. Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages, and the visualisation of a white light.|$|E

In developing mindfulness, one is advised to be aware of all thoughts and sensations that arise, even unwanted or unpleasant ones and continuously attend to <b>such</b> <b>thoughts.</b> Eventually, through habituation and exposure, the intensity and unpleasantness of <b>such</b> <b>thoughts</b> will disappear. Buddhist texts also promote the training of positive emotions such as loving-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity.|$|E

Wagner's mood was such that he seriously contemplated giving up the entire Bayreuth project; he was distracted from <b>such</b> <b>thoughts</b> by an invitation to conduct a series of concerts in London.

500|$|The Ace Attorney Investigations {{spin-off}} series {{splits the}} gameplay into investigation phases and rebuttal phases, {{the latter of}} {{which is similar to}} the courtroom trials of the main series.

At some points, the player can create hologram reproductions of the crime scene, through which they can discover new information that would otherwise be hidden. Ace Attorney Investigations 2 introduces [...] "logic chess", where the player interrogates witnesses in a timed sequence that is visualized as a game of chess, with the player aiming to destroy the other character's chess pieces. To do this, they need to build up their advantage in the discussion by alternating between speaking and listening, and then choose to go on the offensive.|$|E

500|$|During {{investigation}} phases, players control Edgeworth directly, {{either with}} the D-pad, or by sliding the map that is {{displayed on the}} bottom screen. The player has Edgeworth walk around crime scenes in search for evidence; they also meet witnesses and suspects during these phases, who they can talk to. As Edgeworth notices various things in the crime scene, they are saved as Edgeworth's thoughts. Using the [...] "logic" [...] function, the player can connect two <b>such</b> <b>thoughts</b> to gain new information; for instance, by connecting two bullet holes with a gun that has only been fired once, Edgeworth will conclude that two guns must {{have been at the}} crime scene. At some points, the player is able to control a cursor to examine parts of the crime scene; by using the [...] "deduction" [...] function at these points, the player is able to point out a contradiction between the crime scene and evidence. If the player successfully points out a contradiction, they gain access to new information. At certain points, a device called Little Thief can be used to create hologram reproductions of the crime scene; by investigating these reproductions, the player can discover new information that would otherwise be hidden. As more evidence is uncovered, the hologram is updated. After having examined an area sufficiently, the investigation phase ends, and the game moves on to a rebuttal phase.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the same}} year came {{responses}} to the ode by two Romantic writers. Leigh Hunt, a second-generation Romantic poet, added notes to his poem Feast of the Poets that respond to the ideas suggested in Wordsworth's poetry. These ideas include Wordsworth's promotion of a simple mental state without cravings for knowledge, and it is such an ideas that Hunt wanted to mock in his poem. However, Hunt did not disagree completely with Wordsworth's sentiments. After quoting the final lines of the Ode: Intimations of Immortality, those that [...] "Wordsworth has beautifully told us, that to him '--the meanest flow'r that blows can give/ Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears", Hunt claims, [...] "I have no doubt of it; and far be it from me to cast stones into the well in which they lie,-- to disturb those reposing waters,-- that freshness {{at the bottom of}} warm hearts,-- those thoughts, which if they are too deep for tears, are also, in their best mood, too tranquil even for smiles. Far be it also from me to hinder the communication of <b>such</b> <b>thoughts</b> to mankind, when they are not sunk beyond their proper depth, so as to make one dizzy in looking down to them." [...] Following Hunt, William Hazlitt, a critic and Romantic writer, wrote a series of essays called [...] "Character of Mr. Wordsworth's New Poems" [...] in three parts, starting in the 21 August 1814 Examiner. Although Hazlitt treated Wordsworth's poetry fairly, he was critical of Wordsworth himself and he removed any positive statements about Wordsworth's person from a reprint of the essays. The 2 October 1814 essay examined poetry as either of imagination or of sentiment, and quotes the final lines of the poem as an example of [...] "The extreme simplicity which some persons have objected to in Mr. Wordsworth's poetry is to be found only in the subject and style: the sentiments are subtle and profound. In the latter respect, his poetry is as much above the common standard or capacity, as in the other it is below it... We go along with him, while he is the subject of his own narrative, but we take leave of him when he makes pedlars and ploughmen his heroes and the interpreters of his sentiments." ...|$|E

[...] Howard Finkel called for a ten-bell salute. Hart's former Nation of Domination comrades were emotional, most notably Mark Henry, who wept as he read a poem that he wrote in memory of Hart. A tribute video narrated by Vince McMahon then played on the Titan Tron. Throughout the broadcast, personal thoughts on Hart {{in the form of}} shoot interviews with various WWF Superstars were played. Before the first commercial break, <b>such</b> <b>thoughts</b> were aired from Mick Foley and Bradshaw. Foley noted that Hart was his son's favorite wrestler and had proudly gotten a haircut like Owen's, although he also said his son did not quite understand that [...] "nugget" [...] was not a term of endearment. Bradshaw talked about how Hart spent less money on the road than most wrestlers because he wanted to retire early and spend time with his family. Owen's friend and Nation of Domination partner The Rock also made a short speech before engaging in a short match against Val Venis. Test then spoke about a rib Owen pulled on him. [...] The broadcast ended with Stone Cold Steve Austin coming out for a special salute to Hart by climbing the turnbuckle and performing his famous [...] "beer-bash" [...] routine, ending with him giving a toast to Owen (whose picture was displayed on the TitanTron throughout the entire show) and leaving one beer in the ring (for Owen). The only notable absence from this show was The Undertaker as he decided to visit his real-life friend, Bret Hart. The tribute show scored a 7.2 Nielsen rating, making it the highest-rated special episode [...] in Raw history and the third highest-rated show overall. Shawn Michaels, in his Heartbreak and Triumph autobiography, notes that [...] "Owen is the only guy you could have a two-hour show for, and no-one would say a bad word about him."
