25|$|The {{track work}} is quite complex there, {{allowing}} trains {{to enter the}} Pitkin Yard from both the express and local tracks (where C trains relay {{to get from the}} southbound to the northbound local track), and with connections to the two-track Grant Avenue station from both the express and local tracks; the Grant Avenue spur then veers northeast towards Liberty Avenue. All four mainline tracks continue below the Grant Avenue connection, used only to store trains, east under Pitkin Avenue until approximately Eldert Lane (just south of the Grant Avenue station). It was planned that these tracks would continue under Pitkin Avenue to Cross Bay Boulevard, as part of a never-built system expansion which would have extended the Fulton Street Subway to the Rockaways and to Cambria Heights near the Queens-Nassau County border. On the electric light <b>signal</b> <b>board</b> in the control room at Euclid Avenue, there is a taped-over section of the board that hides the 76th Street station. There are also two tracks coming from the Pitkin Yard heading towards the planned 76th Street station site. These tracks would have merged with the mainline tracks just before 76th Street station. When Pitkin Yard originally opened, the yard leads toward 76th Street were usable to relay short trains on. Today, those two tracks are no longer connected via switches. Parts of the trackways still exist, but the switches were removed and the tunnel ends in a cinderblock wall.|$|E
25|$|The {{extension}} of the line to Euclid Avenue opened in November 1948. As part of the extension, the Fulton Line tunnel under Pitkin Avenue was built up to Eldert Lane just past Grant Avenue to facilitate a future subway extension via Pitkin Avenue, while additional trackways were installed in the tunnel just east of Euclid Avenue for a potential connection to the nearby BMT Fulton Street Elevated along Liberty Avenue. The yet-to-be-built Grant Avenue station was also displayed on the <b>signal</b> <b>board</b> in the Euclid Avenue station. In 1949, the Board of Transportation approved a plan to extend the IND Fulton Line along the eastern Fulton El to Lefferts Boulevard. Under the original plans, the Grant Avenue station of the BMT elevated would have been preserved as the first station east of the link. In 1950, the New York City Planning Commission approved funding for an {{extension of}} the Fulton Line east from Euclid Avenue to Grant Avenue. In late 1952, the Board of Transportation began construction on a connection between the IND and both the Fulton El and the Rockaway Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, which included a new underground Grant Avenue station. The station opened on April 29, 1956, along with the connection to the Fulton El east to Lefferts Boulevard. One month later, the station facilitated an {{extension of the}} line to the Rockaways. The station also replaced the former Grant Avenue station on the Fulton El, which was closed and demolished.|$|E

5000|$|... „Belgrade“ Cinema {{was opened}} on 24 October 1940. Both the {{auditorium}} and the entrance passageway from Terazije were furnished with modern equipment. Next {{to the box}} office there was a <b>signal</b> <b>board,</b> that is, a seating plan of the porter and the balcony with lamps on every seat. These lamps indicated vacant seats and helped audience to orient. The auditorium, had a capacity {{of more than one}} thousand seats, comfortable leather chairs on the model of the Berlin Opera. For the first time in Belgrade, the problem of air heating, cooling, regulation of humidity and ventilation was solved by using an American air-conditioning system. The acoustic design of the auditorium was based on its funnel-like shape and the use of special materials for the walls. After the German occupation of Serbia in 1941, the cinema became the “Soldaten-kino”, and after the war, in 1949 the Humoristic Theatre moved in, and used the building together with the cinema “Belgrade”. The Humoristic Theatre underwent certain transformations before it became the “Theatre-on-Terazije”.|$|E

It also provides a footpath and potential cycleway across the Itchen, and acts as a partial screen between the water meadows and the elevated M3 motorway at the foot of Twyford Down. In 2007 Winchester City Council announced a £500,000 rolling programme of repairs over 12 years. [...] However the City Council had held back on any repairs since Sustrans was interested in taking over the Viaduct as part of its Hampshire cycle route system. In March 2012 Hampshire County Council provided a further £250,000 in funding to assist in bringing the viaduct into use as part of National Cycle Route 23.In 2013, following restoration, the viaduct opened to the public as part of National Cycle Route 23, running between Reading and the Isle of Wight.
