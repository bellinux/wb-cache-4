40|$|A fairly {{extensive}} {{introduction to}} the theory behind the use of remote sensing products for vegetation survey work is given. This includes the particular benefits of colour air photographs, the relationship between <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> and scale of mapping and remote sensing products, and {{more information about the}} 'semi-detailed' level of survey operation. The latter is the category of survey which the vegetation survey of the Langebaan area, South Africa, falls into. The importance of the timing of photography in the usefulness of air photographs in vegetation survey work is also emphasised. The particular example of the semi-detailed survey of the vegetation of the Langebaan Area using colour serial photographs of Job 195 was then used in describing the Phases of operation involved. Phase I is essentially the planning stage, Phase II the operational stage, divided into 5 separate sections of operation, and Phase III involves the final mapping and report compilation. Reference to the results is given, as is a short discussion on the merits of air photographic techniques...|$|E

The theoretical part describes the basic definitions of family, intimacy, identity and sexual contentment. The main aim of the research was to find differences in the group of 70 sons, who were divided into two groups, and to answer three main hypotheses - H 1, Father?s absence influences sexual contentment of a man, H 2, Father?s absence has an effect on anxiety of a man and H 3, Sexual anxiety of a man can influence his sexual contentment. The research was designed as a quantitative and a comparative study. For data collection a sexual contentment GRISS questionnaire and the second <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> Anxiety STAI X- 2 questionnaire were used. Data were analyzed via Student's t-test and the Pearson correlation coefficient. Hypothesis H 1 could not be supported, but for hypotheses H 2 and H 3 a statistical significance was found and therefore they could be supported...|$|E
40|$|Some {{scholars}} in China carried out some occasional collection of wild soybeans in the past. Xingdong Sun (Sun and Geng, 1952) used {{to grow and}} observe wild soybeans in Nanjing (Jiangsu Province), Chongqing and Baoding (Hebei Province). Jinling Wang and co-workers (1973) collected wild soybeans in the 1960 s from Fuyuan, Heilongjiang Province in the North to Hengyang, Hunan Province in the South of China and carried some investigations on the day-light and ecological types of wild soybeans. However, large <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> and collection had never been carried out in China until recent years. With increasing enlargement {{of the scope of}} productive activities, and the gradual reduction of wild soybean resources, it became essential to organize national surveying of wild soybean resources in China.

40|$|Establishing species {{distribution}} and population trends are basic requirements in conservation biology, yet acquiring this fundamental information is often difficult. Indirect survey methods {{that rely on}} fecal pellets (scats) can overcome some difficulties but present their own challenges. In particular, variation in scat detectability and decay rate can introduce biases. We studied how vegetation communities affect the detectability and decay rate of scats as exemplified by koalas Phascolarctos cinereus: scat detectability was highly and consistently dependent on ground layer complexity (introducing up to 16 % non-detection bias); scat decay rates were highly heterogeneous within vegetation communities; exposure of scats to surface water and rain strongly accelerated scat decay rate and finally, invertebrates were found to accelerate scat decay rate markedly, but unpredictably. This last phenomenon may explain the high variability of scat decay rate within a single vegetation community. Methods to decrease biases should be evaluated when planning scat surveys, as the most appropriate method(s) will vary depending on species, <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> and landscape characteristics. Detectability and decay biases are both stronger in certain vegetation communities, thus their combined effect is likely to introduce substantial errors in scat surveys and this could result in inappropriate and counterproductive management decisions...|$|E
40|$|Seismic risk {{scenario}} {{has already}} been established for major urban centre by the past, but it is of importance to assess also the seismic risk in wide areas with sparse dwelling centres and few connecting roads. The concept developed consists in linking, for each element at risk, vulnerability values together with hazard values, {{in order to produce}} for a given scenario, risk values relative to road failure or building damage. We had to overpass two antagonistic specifications of wide area scenario : the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> should be large enough to be economic and simple, but a very small element can be responsible for road failure or building collapse. Hazard is expressed in terms of maximum horizontal acceleration of soil, starting point of the risk analysis. Induced phenomena (liquefaction, landslide and rock fall) occurrence are evaluated from basic soil classifications and expressed in terms of minimum PGA value that can trigger it. For each of these hazard and for each element at risk, a simple vulnerability value is evaluated. A standard geographical information system allows gathering these data in order to produce maps pointing out road failure and building damage distribution. The paper presents the important features of a comprehensive study, highlights the methodology discusses the results and provides insights to the future developments...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliography. Interpretation {{of remote}} sensing {{products}} as a procedure {{used during the}} process of vegetation mapping has developed from a purely visual process of image identification to one which can utilize computerised methods to aid consistent identification of vast quantities of digitally stored/recorded spectral information. A description of the Landsat satellite system which is currently providing imagery to potential South African users in the form of digitally stored data and photographic products is given and sources of digital spectral data at other than satellite scales of resolution are described. A brief description of some image processing systems already operational in South Africa and being utilized for land cover mapping is also included. An introduction to the concept of computer analysis of numerical spectral data is given. The difference in approach between workers interpreting geological or other surface features as opposed to those wishing to simplify an image into categories is emphasized. This explains the local effort being expended on development of computer 'classification' routines as opposed to other methods of computer based image processing in vegetation mapping. The first paper presents a review of current use of remote sensing products in vegetation mapping in South Africa and the potential of more recently available products and processes in this field. The relative merits of different film types is discussed, as is the problem of <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey,</b> scale of remote sensing product and scale of final mapping. The position that computer analysis of spectral data occupies in a scheme designed to show the relationships between different scales of survey is described. The second paper describes an example of the application of computer classification techniques to Landsat data in mapping vegetation in the Langebaan area, South Africa, at a semi-detailed scale of operation. The results of this exercise are illustrated together with a map produced using visual air photo interpretation techniques, backed by field checking. More detail of the specific relationships between plant community structure, canopy cover, <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> and reflectance values in the map classes produced is then given in the third paper. Computer classification matches well with major structural divisions; finer structural sub-division descriptions of sample plots correlate well with floristic divisions. A combination of digital analysis of remote sensing products Â·and field checking based on structural schemes is recommended as a rapid mapping process. A report compiled on the full range of investigations carried out up to the end of 1980 into the usefulness of various remote sensing products for studying and mapping the Fynbos Biome is included. The overall mapping objective of this investigation was {{to determine the extent of}} the Fynbos Biome and of the major land use types within it. It was decided that the 'reconnaissance' level of operation at 1 : 250 000 final mapping scale is best suited to meet the overall mapping objective. General conclusions are drawn as to the current status of remote sensing applications in vegetation/land cover mapping in South Africa and elsewhere. Developments and refinements in techniques subsequent to the carrying out of the investigations reported in this account are briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this {{population}} based study is to report on progress in formulating instruments to measure children's resilience and associated protective factors in family, primary school and community contexts. Design/methodology/approach - A total of 2794 students, 1558 parents/caregivers, and 465 staff were surveyed in October 2003. A cross sectional research method {{was used for the}} data collection. Three surveys (Student Survey, and Parent/Caregiver Survey, and Staff Survey) were developed and modified to measure student resilience and associated protective factors. Exploratory factor analysis with Oblimin rotation and confirmatory factor analysis were used to analyse the reliability and validity <b>of</b> the <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> the three <b>surveys.</b> Findings - The surveys indicate good construct validity and internal consistency for the Social Support <b>Scale</b> <b>of</b> Parent/Caregiver <b>Survey,</b> which had been modified from previous studies. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a goodness of fit for the following scales: 1) Student Resilience <b>Scale</b> <b>of</b> the Student <b>Survey,</b> 2) the School Organisation and Climate Scale and Family Functioning <b>Scale</b> <b>of</b> the Parent/Caregiver <b>survey</b> and, 3) the Health Promoting School Scale and Social Capital <b>Scale</b> <b>of</b> the Staff <b>Survey.</b> Practical implications - The current study specifies aspects of the resilience concept within a holistic or socio-ecological setting. Measures of validity and reliability indicate that these instruments have the sensitivity to elucidate the complexity of both the resilience concept and the intricacy of working within the multi-layered world of the school environment. Originality/value - This study provides health educators and researchers with reliable and valid resilience measures which can be used as guidelines in implementing evaluation programmes for the health promoting school project and the prevention of mental health problems in children.

40|$|Cell-in-cell {{structures}} {{refer to}} a unique phenomenon that one living cell enters into another living cell intactly, occurring between homotypic tumor cells or tumor (or other tissue cells) and immune cells (named as heterotypic cell-in-cell structure). In the present study, through a large <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> we observed that heterotypic cell-in-cell structure formation occurred commonly in vitro with host cells derived from different human carcinomas as well as xenotypic mouse tumor cell lines. Most of the lineages of human immune cells, including T, B, NK cells, monocytes {{as well as in}} vitro activated LAK cells, were able to invade tumor cell lines. Poorly differentiated stem cells were capable of internalizing immune cells as well. More significantly, heterotypic tumor/immune cell-in-cell structures were observed in a higher frequency in tumor-derived tissues than those in adjacent tissues. In mouse hepatitis models, heterotypic immune cell/hepatocyte cell-in-cell structures were also formed in a higher frequency than in normal controls. After in vitro culture, different forms of internalized immune cells in heterotypic cell-in-cell structures were observed, with one or multiple immune cells inside host cells undergoing resting, degradation or mitosis. More strikingly, some internalized immune cells penetrated directly into the nucleus of target cells. Multinuclear cells with aneuploid nucleus were formed in target tumor cells after internalizing immune cells as well as in situ tumor regions. Therefore, with the prevalence of heterotypic cell-in-cell structures observed, we suggest that shielding of immune cells inside tumor or inflammatory tissue cells implies the formation of aneuploidy with the increase...|$|E
40|$|Landscape ecology {{provides}} {{a wide spectrum}} of useful techniques for quantitative analysis of the land-mosaic patterns, on the basis of areal, linear and punctual parameters. According to the scale of analysis, data collection can be costly and time-consuming; {{this is especially true in}} areas with a very heterogeneous land-mosaic patterns and landscape-types for environmental variability and cultural reasons. Aims of this work are: 1) to assess the land-mosaic complexity of the traditional agricultural and agro-forestry landscapes (PAfT) of Sicily; 2) to highlight interfaces and structural gradients between main forest areas and closed PAfTs. These aims have the main purpose to pinpoint agricultural areas more closely linked to forest stands, both for spatial and for agro-ecological aspects, useful for the forest planning efforts to increase the regional forest resources and the ecological network. In this way, this work uses the database of the “AGRIT Agro-Ambiente” (AAA) Project (of the AGRIT 2010 - 11 program) realized, on the basis of robust survey methodologies, by the MIPAAF (Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry Policies). This Project, in its first experimental phase, interested the entire island of Sicily by a wide data survey (a total of 7949 sample units – squares 250 m wide) involving the entire land. This database carries information on land use (details according to the “Refresh” SIAN-AGEA legend), linear and punctual agro-ecological parameters, collected both by photo-interpretation and a wide field surveys. Moreover, information, such as the presence of soil erosion and landslides, useful to evaluate agro-ecological processes in action, were also collected. Landscape ecology indexes were derived to analyze the landscape configuration, composition and complexity. Results show as the solid AAA-database is useful to give a real representation of the Sicilian PAfTs and to supply a quantitative and stable characterization of the most important landscape parameters. For instance, PAfTs of the “coltura promiscua” and of the “semi-open fields”, spatially closed to the most important forest and semi-natural areas of Sicily, show the highest values regarding the land-mosaic configuration and complexity. Vice versa, the agricultural landscape of the “open-field” display strong ecological instability (widespread presence of soil erosion and landslides) and a low presence of linear and punctual elements (hedgerows and line breaks, dry-stone walls, isolated trees, centuries-old trees, etc…). With the aim to increase environmental complexity and resilience, forest planning and silviculture could have particular importance in these landscape contexts in next future. In this way, the AGRIT approach (in experimental phase in few Italian region at the moment) can represent a robust data source for powerful applicative tools for achronic and synchronic analysis, at a landscape/wide <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>survey</b> where few data are currently available...|$|E
