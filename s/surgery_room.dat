40|$|International audienceObjective. To {{evaluate}} what is {{the proportion}} of <b>surgery</b> <b>rooms</b> from Marseilles' area that do perform excisional therapies for CIN without any use of colposcopic guidance. Materials and methods. From November 2012 to January 2013, a survey was conducted among all <b>surgery</b> <b>rooms</b> from Marseilles' area practicing excisional therapies for CIN. In addition, answers from gynecologists from Marseilles' area who participated to a national survey that evaluated practices of excisional therapies in France were specifically analyzed. Results. Among the 55 <b>surgery</b> <b>rooms</b> from Marseilles' area practicing excisional therapies, 52 (94. 1 %) participated to the current survey. A colposcope was available in only 19 (36. 5 %) <b>surgery</b> <b>rooms</b> and was systematically used for the guidance of excisional therapies in only 4 (21 %) of these <b>surgery</b> <b>rooms.</b> Finally, 36 (69. 2 %) <b>surgery</b> <b>rooms</b> answered performing excisional therapies without any use of colposcopic guidance. Colposcopy was occasionally and systematically used in 12 (23. 1 %) and 4 (7. 7 %) <b>surgery</b> <b>rooms,</b> respectively. Among the 116 gynecologists from Marseilles' area who answered to the national survey, 88 (75. 9 %) answered not using colposcopy when performing excision for CIN. Only 6 % answered performing excision systematically under direct colposcopic vision and 18. 1 % occasionally. Conclusion. No colposcopic guidance is used when performing excision for ON {{in the majority of}} <b>surgery</b> <b>rooms</b> from Marseilles' area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} was conducted to determine formaldehyde exposure of staffs in pathology laboratories, <b>surgery</b> <b>rooms</b> and endoscopy wards in eight large hospitals of Tehran University of Medical Sciences located at Tehran, Iran. Air sampling {{have been made by}} both long and shortterm methods. Total numbers of samples were 160 for both methods. Nineteen samples of 160 samples were collected as blank in other non-exposed environments such as administrative sections. The mean (SD) levels of formaldehyde in long-term methods were 0. 96 (0. 74), 0. 25 (0. 21) and 0. 13 (0. 18) ppm, at pathology laboratories, <b>surgery</b> <b>rooms</b> and endoscopy wards, respectively. The results of measurements showed that mean (SD) concentration of formaldehyde in one hour sampling at short intervals were 0. 83 (0. 29), 0. 23 (0. 16) and 0. 75 (0. 25) ppm at pathology labs, <b>surgery</b> <b>rooms</b> and endoscopy wards, respectively. There were significant differences in the mean levels of formaldehyde (long-term) at <b>surgery</b> <b>rooms</b> (p< 0. 02) and endoscopy wards (p< 0. 005) in eight hospitals of this study. It is concluded that the concentration levels of formaldehyde at pathology laboratories exceeded recommended limit which established by the American Conference of Governmental and Industrial Hygienists ACGIH (TLV-C= 0. 3 ppm). It is recommended that local exhaust ventilation should be installed to minimize the contact to formaldehyde in the staffs...|$|R

40|$|<b>Surgery</b> <b>rooms</b> are a space type with {{particularly}} stringent indoor {{environmental quality}} (IEQ) requirements (large airflow rates and narrow comfort windows), which translate into high energy use. Due to the unclear IEQ and infection control requirements for <b>surgery</b> <b>rooms</b> in Spain, these spaces are often designed and operated 24 {{hours per day}} and 7 days per week, to meet the most stringent recommendations (not only the requirements) in the available standards and guidelines. This paper critically reviews the Spanish mandatory requirements for <b>surgery</b> <b>rooms</b> by comparing them against their performance motivation and other international standards. Regulatory ambiguities and code-compliant energy efficiency opportunities are identified.; The requirements and recommendations in the standards included in this review differ in their magnitude (particularly the airflow requirements), but are similar in their prescriptive nature. This paper identifies the performance goals associated to the prescriptive requirements, and proposes a method to adjust system operation (outdoor airflow rate, total supply air, indoor air temperature, and indoor air relative humidity) to meet IEQ performance goals while reducing energy use. Further work is required to define operation infection control requirements for the different surgery types and enable a performance based control strategy based on real time particle concentration monitoring.
