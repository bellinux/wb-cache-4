By the operation of the equitable doctrine of conversion money directed to be employed in the purchase of land, or land directed to be turned into money, is in general regarded as that species of property into which it is directed to be converted. An example of property prima facie real which is treated as personal is an estate pur autre vie, which, since 1740, is distributable as personal property {{in the absence of a}} <b>special</b> <b>occupant.</b> Examples of property prima facie personal which is treated as real are fixtures, heirlooms, such as deeds and family portraits, and shares in some of the older companies, as the New River Company, which are real estate by statute. In ordinary cases shares in companies are personal property, unless the shareholders have individually some interest in the land as land.|$|E

II. c. 20, s. 9,1740-1741(now replaced by the Wills Act 1837, s. 6) is distributable as personal property {{in the absence of a}} <b>special</b> <b>occupant.</b> Examples of property prima facie personal which is treated as real are fixtures, heirlooms, such as deeds and family portraits, and shares in some of the older companies, as the New River Company, which are real estate by statute.

5000|$|The {{law in the}} United States agrees in most respects {{with that}} of England. Heirlooms are unknown, one reason being, no doubt, that the {{importance}} of title-deeds is much less than it is in England, owing to the operation of the Registration Acts. Long terms in some states have annexed to them the properties of freehold estates. In some states estates pur autre vie descend like real property; in others an estate pur autre vie is deemed a freehold only during the life of the grantee; after his death it becomes a chattel real. In yet other states the heir has a scintilla of interest as <b>special</b> <b>occupant.</b> [...] In some states railway rolling stock is considered as purely personal, in others it has been held to be a fixture, and so to partake of the nature of real property. Shares in some of the early American corporations were, like New River shares in England, made real estate by statute, {{as in the case of}} the Cape Sable Company in Maryland. In Louisiana animals employed in husbandry are, and slaves were, regarded as immovables. Pews in churches are generally real property, but in some states they are made personal property by statute. The assignment of choses in action is generally permitted, and is in most states regulated by statute. U. W.) ...|$|E

The vehicle featured an independent auxiliary cab heater and included cyclone pre-cleaners {{mounted on the}} front mudguards. The vehicle's top speed was approximately 80 km/h up to 26000 kg GVM(T148 S3) or a total {{truck and trailer combination}} of up to 38000 kg GCM(T148 S3).|$|R
5000|$|USN {{life rafts}} are stowed in {{heavy-duty}} fiberglass canisters {{and can be}} launched manually or automatically should the ship begin to sink. Automatic launching and inflation is actuated by a change in pressure sensed by a hydrostatic release device should the ship begin to sink. A hand pump is provided to [...] "top-off" [...] pressure at night when temperatures drop and internal air pressure decreases. Relief valves are installed in each tube to prevent overpressure. Repairs to holes or rips up to six inches in length can be made using <b>special</b> sealing clamps. <b>Occupants</b> in USN life rafts are protected from wind, rain and sun by built-in canopies which automatically inflate. Hatches are sealable to prevent rain and seawater from entering the life rafts. Survival equipment includes: manual reverse osmosis desalinator (MROD), bottles of fresh water, individual food packets, fishing kit, signaling mirror, rocket and smoke flares, flashlight, spare sea anchor, first aid kit, paddles, spare batteries and bulbs, and aluminized mylar sheets ("space blankets") to aid in caring for victims of hypothermia.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs {{a typical}} crowded public place, fatal deaths {{are caused by}} {{ineffective}} evacuation action in large hospital {{on account of the}} <b>special</b> characteristics of <b>occupants</b> in hospital building, i. e., pathological, physiological and psychological behaviour, etc. Large amount of observation by camera and videos, as well as questionnaires were carried out in a SJ Hospital, which is the one of biggest hospitals in Shenyang. Based on that, correlation analysis was carried out between special behavioural characteristics of occupants in hospital and pedestrian walk velocity, as well as the correlation with their evacuation decision behaviour. Furthermore, evacuation simulation in the hospital building was done on the base of the fire dynamics simulation software FDS+Evac developed by NIST, USA. The investigation results illustrate that occupant walks slowly in hospital buildings at a ratio of 70 %âˆ¼ 90 % comparing with the healthy people in common public buildings. Occupants in hospital building tend to ask help to staffs of the hospital in wayfinding in the case of emergent situations. More than 1 / 3 rd of the occupants are more likely inclined to lose their idea once emergent situation occurs. The evacuation simulation illustrates that egress width and efficient evacuation instructions are the most important strategies in the efficient evacuation in hospital buildings...|$|R
