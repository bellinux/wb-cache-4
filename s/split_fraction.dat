However, the processing and production of biofuels needs improvement to be economically competitive in the current market. One drawback is the presence of naturally occurring compounds that decrease the bioethanol production rate and yield; these are called inhibitors. A resolution to this problem is to remove the inhibitors from biomass fermentation broth prior to fermentation. This project examined liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) for removal of acetic acid, a major inhibitor. Initially, a stock solution of glucose, xylose, acetic acid, and water was combined with an additional organic solvent to form a two-phase system. After mixing, the concentrations of the components in the water phase were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The compounds remaining in the solvent-rich phase were calculated via a simple mass balance.

This work presents the efficient separation process of CO 2 from the simulated fuel gas (39. 2 mol % CO 2 /H- 2 binary mixture) based on the hydrate crystallization {{in the presence of}} tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB) : The experiments were carried out in the TBAB concentration range of 0. 14 - 1. 00 mol %, the temperature range of 275. 15 - 285. 15 K, the driving force range of 1. 00 - 4. 50 MPa, the gas/liquid phase ratio range of 0. 86 - 6. 47, and the hydrate growth time from 15 to 120 min. The results indicate that the increase of the TBAB concentration or the driving force can enhance the separation efficiency, except when the TBAB concentration is above 0. 29 mol % or the driving force is above 2. 50 MPa. The lower gas/liquid phase volume ratio and the hydrate growth time can also promote gas consumption. However, H- 2 more competitively encages into the hydrate phase with time. In addition, the temperature change has little effect on the CO 2 separation efficiency with the fixed driving force. It is worth noting that the one-stage hydrate formation/decomposition process for the fuel gas in the presence of 0. 29 mol % TBAB at 278. 15 K and 2. 50 MPa driving force could obtain a 96. 85 CO 2 -rich gas and a 81. 57 mol % H- 2 -rich gas.

Among the biomass utilization technologies, biomass gasification for combined heat and power is an attractive solution for utilizing biomass effectively. The biomass gasification was studied based on the dual fluidized-bed gasifier developed by the Vienna University of Technology, which has been successfully demonstrated in Güssing, Austria. Aspen Plus V 8 was used for the modelling and simulation of the biomass gasification process. The gasifier was modeled using minimum Gibbs free energy method. The key operating parameters including the feed steam temperature, feed air temperature, steam to biomass ratio, and the gasification temperature were varied using the sensitivity analysis block of Aspen Plus. The effects of changing the parameters on the output syngas composition, LHV of the syngas, char <b>split</b> <b>fraction</b> and the gasification efficiency were studied. The sensitivity analysis results indicated that both preheating the feed steam and air have positive effect on increasing the LHV of the syngas and the gasification efficiency. Preheating air is more effectively than preheating the steam. Increasing the steam to biomass ratio results in the increase of the hydrogen yield and the proportion of hydrogen content in the syngas, while the increase of the S/B had negative effects on increasing the LHV of the syngas and the gasification efficiency. Increasing the gasification temperature resulted in the decrease of the gasification efficiency and the hydrogen yield, while it had positive effect on the increase of the LHV of the syngas. The gasification results behaved a little different when the steam to biomass ratio and the gasification temperature are low. Base on the results, it was found that the optimum gasification temperature should be kept around 750 - 850 ℃, the steam to biomass ratio should be kept around 0. 4 - 0. 6.

In the first part comprehensive analysis of fatty acids in different samples (fish oil, canola oil and biodiesel oil) is reported using field ionization mass spectrometry (FI MS) combined with GC using a polar column. This 2 D separation technique (GC×FI MS) enables the identification and separation of fatty acids with different chain lengths, different number, position and types of unsaturation (i. e. double bonds, cyclic groups) and different configuration of double bonds (i. e. cis/trans) in one run. In the second part of this dissertation low energy electron impact ionization (EI, 30 eV) spectra in combination with multivariate data analysis is shown to enable the identification of all geometrical isomers of a &# 969; 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid. Several rules about the fragmentation of polyunsaturated compounds are derived using data from over 300 compounds. In the third part a new instrumental configuration is proposed to allow simultaneous recording of soft (i. e. FI, chapter 3) and hard (EI, chapter 4) ionization techniques in one run.

40|$|Designing {{strategies}} for efficient oil production from reservoirs {{rely heavily on}} reservoir simulation studies, which in-turn is based on various nonlinear formulations. It is therefore very important to develop a robust simulation model that captures the flow of various components present in different phases and the associated thermodynamic and chemical interactions. A compositional formulation is a reliable option for understanding these complex subsurface processes. However, this type of model has a great computational cost, since the number of equations (nc) {{that needs to be}} solved in each grid block increases proportionally with the number of components employed. The solution of the multicomponent multiphase flow problem is obtained by solving the associated nonlinear governing equation describing the conservation of mass, thereby determining the pressure (P) and compositional changes (Z) of the system. On the other hand, an Equation of state (EoS) model is employed to describe the phase behavior of the system, which in turn is accomplished in two stages: Phase stability test - to identify the existence of number of phase in a particular grid cell, and Flash calculation - to determine the <b>split</b> <b>fraction</b> of components amongst the phases present. The aforesaid procedure is referred as the standard EoS based approach to solve compositional problem and they are generally arduous. In previous works, a compositional-space parameterization approach was proposed to speed up the phase-behavior calculations by replacing the flash calculation with interpolations in the parameter space of the problem. The phase behavior of gas-injection processes is predominantly controlled by the properties of the two key tie-lines that extend through the initial and the injection compositions, and hence it is convenient to parameterize the problem based on these two tie-lines. It has also been proven that the projection of composition solution onto the full tie-line space is invariant to the hydrodynamic property of the compositional system. Here we utilize this technique to develop a multiscale reconstruction of compositional transport. Two types of prolongation operators are defined based on the local saturation history, with each having different computational complexities. In the first stage, a fine scale prolongation operator is implemented on a modified conservation equation with the objective of reconstructing the leading and trailing shock positions in space. Once the position of shocks are identified, the solution lying in the regions outside the shock can be solved on a coarse-scale mesh, since the structure of the transport solution outside of the two-phase region is relatively simple. Later, the fine scale projection of this coarse solution is carried out using the constant prolongation operator. The solution for nc components lying in between leading and trailing shocks is reconstructed by solving just two equations. The proposed reconstruction strategy results in coarsening of the compositional problem, both in space and representation. By this way, the simulation time is appreciably reduced by several folds without significant loss in accuracy of the results. Also, the proposed multiscale technique is evaluated by comparing them with a suitable upscaling methodology, since they are generally characterized by an affable framework of implementation {{and one of the most}} widely sought out ways to enhance computational efficiency.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{research}} {{undertaken in}} this study was based on a novel flotation device, the Reflux Flotation Cell (RFC). This system consists of multiple parallel inclined channels positioned below a vertical chamber. The inclined channels provide an effective increase in the cross-sectional area of the vessel, thus permitting enhanced bubble-liquid segregation efficiency when the bubbles are conveyed into the inclined channels. In this thesis, fast flotation is defined as simultaneously maximising three fundamental flotation aspects: the kinetics for particle collection by bubbles, the supply of bubble surface area flux for particle extraction, and the segregation of the fine bubbles from the tailings flow. Only one or two aspects can be addressed effectively using conventional flotation systems, hence those systems are constrained by the rate limiting aspect. The RFC, however, offers the potential to achieve increases in all three areas, meaning the concept of Fast Flotation can be achieved, delivering very high flotation rates per unit of vessel area. The study firstly addressed the hydrodynamics of the RFC. Drift flux theory was used to describe the performance of the conventional vertical flotation column, predicting the theoretical gas flux, liquid flux, and the bubble surface area flux under the flooding condition. The capacity advantage, developed from the Reflux Classifier to describe the enhanced processing rate using inclined channels, is utilised to estimate the enhancement of bubble surface area flux. The theory showed the bubble surface area flux of the RFC could be increased to well beyond the typical levels of conventional flotation systems under flooding condition. A series of experiments was conducted using the laboratory RFC based on the bubble-liquid system. The experimental work achieved a bubble surface area flux of about 600 m²/m²/s, more than an order of magnitude larger than achieved in conventional flotation. Another series of experiments, having the same operating conditions as in the RFC system, involved the use of a vertical column. Extreme gas fluxes of up to 5. 5 cm/s, and feed fluxes of up to 16 cm/s were applied, significantly higher than the conventional operating ranges. The results showed the inclined channels greatly enhanced the bubble-liquid segregation, preserving the fraction of feed liquid reporting to overflow to well below 24 %. By comparison, 50 % to 80 % of the feed liquid was conveyed to the overflow using the vertical column, driven by the need to prevent bubbles reporting to the underflow, thus exhibiting very inefficient segregation. Hydrodynamic investigation of the RFC system showed great potential to achieve fast flotation. Thus {{the second part of the}} study involved the processing of low pulp density fine coal slurries collected from the overflow of the hydrocyclone in a coal preparation plant. Three slurry pulp densities of 0. 34 wt%, 3. 0 wt%, and 5. 2 wt% were processed. Very high feed fluxes in the range of 10 to 12 cm/s, more than ten times higher than the typical level of conventional flotation, and high gas fluxes from 2 to 6 cm/s were used. Combustible recoveries between 66 % and 78 % were obtained for the extremely low feed pulp density of 0. 34 wt%. A near complete recovery of 98 % was achieved for the coarser particles above 38 µm. By increasing the feed pulp density, the overall combustible recoveries were largely maintained, reaching up to 86 %, while there was a decline in the recovery of the particles above 38 µm. The underflow discharging rate, affecting the overflow rate and the overflow liquid <b>split</b> (<b>fraction</b> of feed liquid reporting to overflow), determined the amount of gangue particles transported to product. The product ash was reduced by increasing the underflow rate, leading to a product ash of 18 %, well below the feed ash of about 50 %. The rejection of the mineral matter increased almost linearly as the overflow liquid split was decreased. The final part of the thesis was concerned with the flotation kinetics within a single channelled downcomer. The drift flux model was utilised to analyse the bubble volume fraction of the two-phase downward flow by varying the gas flux and the liquid flux. Graphical analysis of the drift flux curve and operating lines showed the bubble volume fraction in the flow was reduced with an increase in the liquid flux and a decrease in the gas flux. The flotation performance of three downcomer channel gaps of 2 mm, 4. 5 mm, and 9 mm, were experimentally examined using a clean coal feed. The bubble-particle interaction in the downcomer was affected by the shear rate and the fluid turbulence inside the downcomer channel for a given gas flux and feed flux. The investigation of partition numbers showed that the particle recovery for a given particle size was improved with increasing gas flux, and decreasing feed flux for the narrower downcomer channel gaps of 2 mm and 4. 5 mm. For a given feed flux and gas flux in the downcomer, higher particle recovery was achieved using the downcomer channel gaps of 2 mm and 4. 5 mm. The first-order kinetic constant in the downcomer was obtained using a plug flow model. The downcomer kinetic constant was related to the particle size, the gas flux and feed flux in the downcomer. The correlations of the downcomer kinetic constant with the particle size, the downcomer gas flux and the downcomer feed were developed to provide a consistent basis for assessing the recovery performance for the three downcomer channel dimensions. The 2 mm and 4. 5 mm channelled downcomers showed superiority for a wide range of feed fluxes when using high gas fluxes...|$|E

Interestingly, we first reveal that the traditional Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) or optimal Randomized Splitting (RS) strategies are consistently outperformed by the Constant Splitting Rule (CSR) where the incoming traffic is split with a constant fraction towards the available servers. This finding motivates us to obtain the optimal <b>splitting</b> <b>fraction</b> under CSR. However, the objective function to be minimized depends on the mean queue length of the servers, whose closed-form expression is not available and often intractable for general arrival and service processes.

The experiments are conducted at the DTAC concentration range of 0 - 0. 056 mol%, initial pressures range of 0. 66 MPa- 2. 66 MPa and temperature range of 274. 95 K- 277. 15 K. The results indicate that the initial pressure of 1. 66 MPa in conjunction with the concentration of 0. 028 mol% DTAC is most favorable for CO(2) separation. At the condition, the induction time of forming the hydrate can be shortened considerably and CO(2) can be purified from 17. 0 mol% to 99. 4 % with the two-stage hydrate separation process. CO(2) <b>split</b> <b>fractions</b> for Stage 1 and Stage 2 are 0. 54 and 0. 39, respectively, and the separation factors are 9. 60 and 62. 25, respectively.

40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} {{question}} of routing for minimum average drop rate over unreliable servers that are prone to random buffer failures. Such a generic setup {{can be used to}} model scenarios of interest in unreliable data or manufacturing networks. Interestingly, we first reveal that the traditional Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) or optimal Randomized Splitting (RS) strategies are consistently outperformed by the Constant Splitting Rule (CSR) where the incoming traffic is split with a constant fraction towards the available servers. This finding motivates us to obtain the optimal <b>splitting</b> <b>fraction</b> under CSR. However, the objective function to be minimized depends on the mean queue length of the servers, whose closed-form expression is not available and often in-tractable for general arrival and service processes. Thus, we use non-derivative methods to solve this optimization problem by approximately evaluating the objective value at each iteration. To that end, we explicitly characterize the approximation error by utilizing the regenerating nature of unreliable buffers. By adaptively controlling the precision of this approximation, we show that our proposed algorithm converges to an optimal splitting decision in the almost sure sense. I...|$|R

Yet, previous works on non-derivative methods assume continuous differentiability of the objective function, {{which is not the}} case in our setup. We relax this strong assumption to the case when the objective function is locally Lipschitz continuous, which is another contribution of this paper...|$|R
