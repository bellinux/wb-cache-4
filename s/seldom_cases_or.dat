His lessons in Fiqh and Usul al-fiqh became incredibly popular, attracting hundreds of students. Furthermore, it is estimated that 200,000 Tomans a year of Khums money was tithed to Ansari's base in Najaf [...] "from all over the Islamic world". Despite this, Ansari lived humbly, generously provided stipends to his Islamic students with these funds, and this resulted in a confirmation of Najaf's standing as center of Shiah learning. In spite of the tremendous prestige attached to his position, Ansari lived the life of an ascetic. When he died, his two daughters were unable to pay for his funeral expenses from his inheritance. He rarely used his authority in the Shia community, <b>seldom</b> judging <b>cases</b> <b>or</b> giving fatawa.|$|R

The clinical syndrome PMWS was <b>seldom</b> recognized in <b>case</b> <b>or</b> control herds; however, PCV- 2 infection was widespread at the herd level. Other factors more strongly associated with increased piglet mortality rate than herd level PCV- 2 infection were Mycoplasma hyopneumonia infection, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), and diarrhea caused by Eschericia coli K 88. Management factors associated with case herd status included close proximity to other herds, larger number of sows supplying pigs to the nursery, larger range in age and weight going into the nursery, the moving of lightweight pigs into another nursery room {{at the end of}} the nursery fill, and not using spray-dried plasma in the 1 st nursery ration. These results highlight the host–agent–environment triad leading to high nursery-barn mortality rates...|$|R

50|$|A special {{part of the}} centuries-old {{cultural}} heritage of the Inuit are their myths and legends, which had been passed exclusively by word of mouth, because the Inuit had no written language and consequently had no literary tradition. In the Inuit culture story telling had the function that in other cultures literature has. The oral recital of passed-on knowledge gave the Inuit families particularly a feeling of immediate togetherness. At the same time, narrating made a connection between past and present, because the essential statements had been passed {{from generation to generation}} and accepted as the truth, without reservations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To locate {{sources of}} {{occupational}} exposure to nasal and bladder carcinogens for surveillance follow up in British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: Incident cases of nasal cancer (n = 48), bladder cancer (n = 105), and population based controls (n = 159) matched for sex and age, were interviewed about their jobs, exposures, and smoking histories. Odds ratios (ORs) {{were calculated for}} 57 occupational groups with stratified exact methods to control for age, sex, and smoking. RESULTS: Occupational groups at increased risk of nasal cancer included: textile workers (six <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 7. 6); miners, drillers, and blasters (six <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 3. 5); welders (two <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 3. 5); pulp and paper workers (three <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 3. 1); and plumbers and pipefitters (two <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 3. 0). Nasal cancer ORs were not increased in occupations exposed to wood dust, possibly due to low exposures in local wood industries. Strongly increased risks of bladder cancer were found for sheet metal workers (four <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 5. 3), miners (19 <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 4. 5), gardeners (six <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 3. 7), and hairdressers (three <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 3. 2). Among occupations originally considered at risk, the following had increased risks of bladder cancer: painters (four <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 2. 8); laundry workers (five <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 2. 3); chemical and petroleum workers (15 <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 1. 8); machinists (eight <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 1. 6); and textile workers (three <b>cases,</b> <b>OR</b> 1. 5). CONCLUSIONS: Occupational groups with increased risks and three <b>or</b> more <b>cases</b> with similar duties were selected for surveillance follow up. For nasal cancer, these included textile workers (five were garment makers) and pulp and paper workers (three performed maintenance tasks likely to entail stainless steel welding). For bladder cancer, these included miners (12 worked underground), machinists (five worked in traditional machining), hairdressers (three had applied hair dyes), and laundry workers (three were drycleaners) ...|$|R

Case report: A- 35 -year old man presented with a 6 -month history of left scrotal mass and a 1 -day history of bilateral lower extremity edema. Computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of thrombus extending from the left spermatic vein and bilateral external iliac veins to the hepatic vein, and multiple lymph node and lung metastases. 3 cycles of chemotherapy were given after the left high inguinal orchiectomy. Pathological examination demonstrated a pure yolk sac carcinoma with lymphovascular invasion and direct tumor extension into the left spermatic cord. CT and positron emission tompgraphy-CT obtained no findings of metastasis or recurrence at 3 months after the chemotherapy.
