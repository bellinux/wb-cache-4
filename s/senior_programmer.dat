25|$|In Wright's 2005 demonstration, the {{creature}} {{with which he}} began looked remarkably similar to his earlier microbe. This led many {{people to believe that}} {{the creature}} was based upon the microbe's appearance. However, in a 2006 video from E3, narrated by a <b>senior</b> <b>programmer,</b> it was said that the player will initially begin as a slug-like animal. The narrator further stated the reason for this was to allow for more player creativity. This created uncertainty as to which method would be used in the final game; particularly as a later video demonstrated the essence of the cell creature emerging from a pond. The 2007 TED Presentation in March 2007 again depicted a legless, slug-like creature emerging from the water, leaving a trail of slime in its wake. The cellular phase was renamed as the tide pool phase, then called the cell phase months later. The final phases: Cell, Creature, Tribal, Civilization and Space were the five available stages at the final release of Spore.|$|E
25|$|In November 2012, Double Fine, {{along with}} the Humble Bundle group, {{announced}} Amnesia Fortnight 2012, a charity drive based on the previous Amnesia Fortnight. During this, those that paid a minimum of $1 {{had the opportunity to}} vote on 23 concept ideas. After the completion of the voting period, Double Fine developed the top five voted ideas into game prototypes that were available for those that purchased the bundle. The prototypes were (in order of receiving the most votes): Hack 'n' Slash, a Legend of Zelda inspired action/adventure, where players need to hack to solve puzzles, led by <b>senior</b> <b>programmer</b> Brandon Dillon, Spacebase DF-9, a sim game set in space, led by designer-programmer JP LeBreton, The White Birch, an ambient platform game (inspired by Ico and Journey), led by art director Andy Wood, Autonomous, a retro-futuristic sandbox robot game, led by art director Lee Petty, and Black Lake, a fairytale exploration game led by senior artist Levi Ryken. In addition, the purchaser received the initial prototypes of Costume Quest, Happy Song (what would become Once Upon a Monster), and Brazen, a Monster Hunter-style four-player online co-op homage to Ray Harryhausen, which was led by Brad Muir, who was also project lead of Iron Brigade. The development of the prototypes was documented by 2 Player Productions.|$|E

500|$|The Amiga {{conversion}} of Desert Strike featured upgraded graphics and sound over the Mega Drive original. With {{regards to the}} Jungle Strike Amiga conversion, <b>senior</b> <b>programmer</b> Stuart Johnson stated he [...] "tried to keep this conversion a lot more faithful to the Mega Drive version than Desert Strike was". He attempted to make the Amiga conversion run more smoothly than the Mega Drive original. Graphical improvements were attempted: these were less successful on the A500 than the A1200 because of technical restrictions. The developers also struggled with technical challenges because of differences in hardware between the Mega Drive and Amiga. Amendments were also made to the workings of in-mission plot screens. The Amiga conversion was released as sequel Urban Strike was published for the Mega Drive in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Michal Valient, a <b>Senior</b> <b>Programmer</b> at Guerrilla Games, {{presented}} {{details of}} their Killzone 2 proprietary game engine at a Developers Conference in July 2007. As with many other titles published by SCE, including LittleBigPlanet and Infamous, Killzone 2 uses a deferred shading engine which enables far greater control over the game's characteristic lighting palette, while maximising processor throughput and limiting shader complexity. Other games to use similar approaches include Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto IV and GSC Game World's [...] However, this approach does create some additional problems; notably with respect to anti-aliasing and transparencies. The former was solved using a MSAA Quincunx (multisample anti-aliasing) solution, and the latter {{by the addition of}} a standard forward rendering path. The game's graphics were universally praised by critics.|$|E
2500|$|Larry Ellison co-founded Oracle Corporation in 1977 with Bob Miner and Ed Oates {{under the}} name Software Development Laboratories (SDL). Ellison took {{inspiration}} from the 1970 paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database management systems (RDBMS) named [...] "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks." [...] He heard about the IBM System R database from {{an article in the}} IBM Research Journal provided by Oates. Also derived from Codd's theories, Ellison wanted to make Oracle's product compatible with System R, but failed to do so as IBM kept the error codes for their DBMS a secret. SDL changed its name to Relational Software, Inc (RSI) in 1979, then again to Oracle Systems Corporation in 1982, to align itself more closely with its flagship product Oracle Database. At this stage Bob Miner served as the company's <b>senior</b> <b>programmer.</b> On March 12, 1986, the company had its initial public offering. In 1995, Oracle Systems Corporation changed its name to Oracle Corporation, officially named Oracle, but sometimes referred to as Oracle Corporation, the name of the holding company. Part of Oracle Corporation's early success arose from using the C programming language to implement its products. This eased porting to different operating systems (most of which support C).|$|E

50|$|Programmers' work {{varies widely}} {{depending}} on the type of business for which they are writing programs. For example, the instructions involved in updating financial records are very different from those required to duplicate conditions on an aircraft for pilots training in a flight simulator. Simple programs can be written in a few hours, more complex ones may require more than a year of work, while others are never considered 'complete' but rather are continuously improved as long as they stay in use. In most cases, several programmers work together as a team under a <b>senior</b> <b>programmer’s</b> supervision.|$|R

50|$|The chief {{programmer}} team will usually contain three-person teams. Consisting of a chief <b>programmer,</b> <b>senior</b> level <b>programmer</b> and a program librarian while additional programmers and analysts {{are added to the}} team when necessary. The weaknesses of this structure include a lack of communication across team members, task cooperation and complex task completion. The {{chief programmer}} team works best for tasks that are more simple and straightforward since the flow of information in the team is limited. Individuals that work in this team structure typically report lower work morale.|$|R

50|$|Programmers write {{programs}} {{according to}} the specifications determined primarily by more <b>senior</b> <b>programmers</b> and by systems analysts. After the design process is complete, it {{is the job of}} the programmer to convert that design into a logical series of instructions that the computer can follow. The programmer codes these instructions in one of many programming languages. Different programming languages are used depending on the purpose of the program. COBOL, for example, is commonly used for business applications that typically run on mainframe and midrange computers, whereas Fortran is used in science and engineering. C++ is widely used for both scientific and business applications. Java, C#, VB and PHP are popular programming languages for Web and business applications. Programmers generally know more than one programming language and, because many languages are similar, they often can learn new languages relatively easily. In practice, programmers often are referred to by the language they know, e.g. as Java programmers, or by the type of function they perform or environment in which they work: for example, database programmers, mainframe programmers, or Web developers.|$|R
