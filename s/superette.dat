50|$|In New Zealand, {{convenience}} stores are {{commonly referred to}} as dairies and <b>superettes.</b> Dairies in New Zealand are generally independently owned and operated. The use of the term dairy to describe {{convenience stores}} was common in New Zealand by the late 1930s. Dairies carved out a niche in food retail by keeping longer trading hours than grocery stores and supermarkets - dairies were exempt from labor laws restricting trading hours and Saturday trading. With the deregulation of trading hours and in the wake of legislation in 1989 prohibiting sales of alcohol by dairies, the distinction between dairies, <b>superettes,</b> and grocery stores has blurred in New Zealand.|$|R

With its 6,500 convenience stores, Casino leads this segment in France.|$|R

5000|$|The {{distinction}} between dairies, <b>superettes</b> and grocery stores has grown increasingly blurred in New Zealand English, a fact acknowledged by the Liquor Licensing Authority in 1991, {{and by the}} Law Commission. Contributing factors to this blurring of meanings include the deregulation of trading shop hours on Sundays, ambiguity over alcohol sales laws (see Sales of alcohol below), and the abolition of restrictions on types of goods permitted to be sold by dairies. The Law Commission summed up the ambiguity as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|The Republic of Ireland has {{two major}} {{supermarket}} chains: Tesco Ireland, {{a subsidiary of}} Tesco plc with 91 stores (4 <b>superettes,</b> 5 small super, 44 large super, 38 hyper), and Dunnes Stores, owned by a trust consisting {{of members of the}} family of its founder, Ben Dunne Snr, and boasting 123 stores (this number includes some stores without supermarkets, however). A third large supermarket chain is Superquinn, though this has only 21 stores, and is based mainly in Leinster (2 small super, 15 large super, 4 hyper). Marks and Spencer also operates a small number of supermarket sites.|$|R
25|$|Other {{businesses}} {{are those that}} can be found in other modern cities (banks, insurance, bakeries, the press houses, clothes, etc.). The city has a supermarket and a hypermarket, as well as several <b>superettes</b> and other discounters. The hypermarket, which is of recent construction, belongs to the Système U group and is located in the new area of activity of Ramilles. The supermarket (Intermarché) is, meanwhile, close to the city centre. Markets, vestiges of the traditional markets of the city are many, taking place on Wednesday (textile, utility, etc.) at Place Chaptal, and on Saturday mornings (food market) at Place Chaptal and Place Urbain V. In addition, night markets are held during the summer.|$|R

40|$|Amid the {{conditions}} of increasingly fierce competition, retailers are {{doing their best to}} meet the demands of their customers as efficiently as possible. Through the ever-growing level of product availability they raise the quality of service, which is positively reflected not only on the growth in sales, but also customer satisfaction. In the opposite case, the out-ofstock problem emerges, affecting not only customers, but also retailers and their suppliers. Bearing in mind, that the causes of the given problem occur most frequently in the last metres of the supply chain, in this paper we investigated the effect of backroom size on product availability, depending on the retail format. For this purpose, we used moderated regression analysis on the sample of 80 fast moving consumer goods in retail stores located on the territory of the Republic of Serbia. The obtained results pointed to opposite movements in the smallest and the largest format. Whereas in <b>superettes</b> the out-of-stock level lowers with the increase in the backroom size, it tends to drop in hypermarkets. Therefore, we pointed to some in-store problems that cause product stock-outs in different store formats. In addition to indicating the potential causes of analyzed relations, this paper also presents certain operational and technological solutions related to their mitigation...|$|R
40|$|Two {{blockbuster}} mergers wereannounced in 1998 involvingthe largest-ever {{combined sales}} by food retailers. Kroger, already the largest grocery retailer in the United States with 1997 sales of $ 26 billion, merged with Fred Meyer {{to form a}} multiregional supermarket operator with $ 45. 3 billion in combined sales in 1999 (table 1). The merger resulted in the combined sales accounting for an estimated 10. 4 percent of total gro-cery store sales, which reached $ 434. 7 billion in 1999, including sales of supermarkets, <b>superettes,</b> convenience stores, delicatessens, and smaller grocery stores. With Fred Meyer operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Kroger Com-pany, the combined firm operates 2, 288 supermarkets in 31 States and 816 convenience stores in an addi-tional 6 States. Also in 1998, the fourth-largest U. S. food retailer, Albertsons, initi-ated its merger with second-ranked American Stores—operator of Lucky Stores, Jewel, and Acme Markets— resulting in combined sales of $ 28. 9 billion, operating 1, 690 supermar-kets in 38 States. These mergers {{are part of a}} recent strategy among the largest U. S. grocery store retailers to maintain their leading positions while considerably growing in size both by merging with or acquiring other grocery retailers (table 2 and fig. 1). Mergers and acquisitions have enabled grocery retailers to quickly become larger by purchasing exist-ing stores rather than building new ones. Prior to 1998, both Kroger and Albertson’s had grown primarily by building stores in new locations and regions. Although mergers an...|$|R
