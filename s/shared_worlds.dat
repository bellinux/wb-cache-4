The first Dragonlance trilogy, Chronicles, {{launched}} the Dungeons & Dragons line of novels, with many of its characters spun off into other novels.

40|$|This {{rigorous}} {{thesis is}} a study on crisis of a <b>shared</b> <b>world.</b> Furthermore, it brings some strategies {{how to deal with}} it. In the first part the author introduces the <b>shared</b> <b>world</b> and analyses its existence conditions, which are physical public space, the public and media public space. At {{the end of the first}} part, the author characterises civic society as a result of an ideal combination of those three above mentioned conditions. In the second part, the author illustrates the crisis of the <b>shared</b> <b>world</b> on selected phenomena of physical and media public space, the public and civic society. The crux of his work is in presenting three main types of activist groups (social movements, non-profit organizations and individual artists and artist groups) and analysing chosen strategies focused on how to recapture the <b>shared</b> <b>world</b> through physical and media public space. Physical public space - direct action, reclaim the street, critical mass, guerilla gardening, flash mob, street art, culture jamming, etc. Media public space - alternative media, cyberactivism, hactivism, mass virtual active action, culture jamming, etc...|$|R

5000|$|The book {{collects}} ten fantasy {{stories by}} Wrede, {{together with a}} recipe associated {{with one of the}} stories and notes by the author concerning the inspiration of some of the stories. Two of the tales are set in the <b>shared</b> <b>worlds</b> of Will Shetterley and Emma Bull's Liavek ("Rikiki and the Wizard") and Andre Norton's Witch World ("The Sword-Seller"). Two stories ("The Princess, the Cat, and the Unicorn" [...] and [...] "Utensile Strength") are set in the world of Wrede's own Enchanted Forest Chronicles. Two ("Stronger than Time" [...] and [...] "The Lorelei") are retellings, or alternate versions of traditional fairy or folk tales. One ("Cruel Sisters") is based on a folk song, a variant of The Twa Sisters, that Wrede once heard performed by Loreena McKennitt as The Bonny Swans. McKennitt's change to a particular line ("and he had daughters, one, two three...") inspired Wrede to write the story from the third daughter's point of view.|$|E

40|$|The "Harsanyi Doctrine" {{asserts that}} {{differences}} in individuals' beliefs are to be attributed entirely to differences in information. In its embodiment as a Common Prior assumption it {{is central to the}} economics of information and the foundations of game theory. This paper attempts to provide a framework for the Harsanyi Doctrine (in an incomplete information framework) based on two qualitative properties of individuals' belief hierarchies: Fundamental Agreement and <b>Shared</b> <b>Worlds.</b> A general notion of "agreeing to disagree" about "belief indices" satisfying a Bayesian Sure-Thing Principle is introduced and illustrated by a range of examples and subsequently characterized as equivalent to a local version of the Common Prior assumption. Fundamental Agreement is defined as the absence of any such (implicit) agreement to disagree. The non-trivial gap between this and Harsanyi Consistency proper is bridged by a novel <b>Shared</b> <b>Worlds</b> condition, which requires individuals' beliefs about what is commonly believed to be equal. Common belief in the conjunction of Fundamental Agreement and <b>Shared</b> <b>Worlds</b> is then shown to be equivalent to Harsanyi Consistency. On the technical level, this paper is probably the first to (have to) seriously confront the failure of the common belief operator to satisfy the axiom of "Negative Introspection. "...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the multiple strands of liberal ideology interwoven in social policy in four countries often regarded as having ‘liberal’ welfare states. These are Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. Social policy liberalism includes both classical liberalism {{in its original}} and neo-liberal forms, and social liberalism in the ‘new liberalism’ of {{the early twentieth century}} and the social policy legacies of Keynes, Beveridge, Marsh, Roosevelt and Chifley. Liberalism in whatever variant sits uneasily with contemporary conceptions of gender relations and the sexual division of labour, in which men and women are regarded as having separate and equal rights as individuals and yet as also inhabiting <b>shared</b> <b>worlds</b> of collective responsibility. The paper identifies a shift {{in the way in which}} successive social policy variants of liberal ideology have understood gender relations and the division between public and private spheres of social and economic life. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{solutions to}} many of the problems associated with large-scale, widely distributed virtual reality, based on an architecture of heterogeneous devices and limited publically accessible bandwidth. The emphasis is on achieving multi-user, interactive virtual reality via the Internet, which inherently involves the associated problems, {{due to the nature of}} the Internet. The order of the discussion will be to first present a taxonomy of possibly scalable architectures based on their communication topology and data distribution. The next section will give an overview of related work in this field. Following on from this will be sections dealing with the problems involved with <b>shared</b> <b>worlds</b> of this nature and their possible solutions based on the author's research. A final architecture will then be presented which encompasses these solutions. Finally, it will be discussed how to interface the architecture with VRML(the Virtual Reality Modelling Language) which has become th [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Studying virtual math teams {{involves}} explorations along multiple dimensions: (a) {{designing a}} testbed to support interaction within teams, (b) analyzing how math is discussed within this setting and (c) describing how the teams achieve their cognitive tasks. Previous chapters have shown {{in various ways}} how virtual math teams co-construct their <b>shared</b> <b>worlds</b> of math discourse. This concluding chapter discusses how the VMT Project designed {{an environment in which}} this could take place and be studied; it reviews how the project approached the rigorous study of what took place in these virtual worlds; and it reflects on the nature of group cognition as an object for scientific investigation. In this way, the present volume prepares the way for a science of group cognition, a systematic description of the processes at the group level of analysis that may contribute to problem solving, knowledge building and other cognitive tasks undertaken by small groups collaborating synchronously over networked computers.

40|$|This dissertation, Conjuring Blight in an Urban Landscape: Market Farms and Aerosol Murals in Oakland, CA, {{examines}} collaborations {{between the}} City of Oakland and several nonprofits to cover key city {{functions in the}} face of a fiscal crisis precipitated by the national recession (2008 - 2011). Based in eighteen months of ethnographic research and years of additional interaction, my research shows the ways that bureaucrats, gardeners and aerosol muralists are all actively inscribing spaces and claiming ownership over them, through their actions and material interactions; this process of co-creation defines the legality, subjectivity, and economics of the people and institutions involved. This dissertation explores the public power of imagination in creating <b>shared</b> <b>worlds</b> and how the material effects of these imaginings co-constitute space. These transformations of space are driven by the need to transform people - the poor, the unhealthy, the disempowered - to encourage behaviors desired by the City and nonprofit organizations in their collaborations. Blight is a central metaphor used to create categories, effect imaginings, and produce certain types of space, with far-reaching effects on the lives lived within it...|$|E
