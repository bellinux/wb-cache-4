Planets in benefic shashtiamsas produce auspicious results while the opposite is true in case of planets in malefic shashtiamsas.

METHODS: In this study, we installed the GPS, IMU, DMI, camera, laser sensor on the van and surveyed the car position, fore-sight image, point cloud of traffic signs. To insert automatic position of traffic sign, the automatic traffic sign recognition S/W developed and it can log the traffic sign type and approximate position, this study suggests a methodology to transform the laser point-cloud to the map coordinate system with the 3 D axis rotation algorithm. RESULTS: Result show that on a clear day, traffic sign recognition ratio is 92. 98 %, and on cloudy day recognition ratio is 80. 58 %. To insert exact traffic <b>sign</b> <b>position.</b> This study examined the point difference with the road surveying results.

40|$|AbstractThe {{problems}} {{of virtual reality}} assume a special actuality nowadays in the culture and in the philosophical approaches. The modern philosophy is firmly connected with the linguistic and sign problematic. The virtual reality is analyzed as special space and time, in which ontological and gnosiological problems acquire a particular perception. The research of virtual reality as complicated and multilevel text, as the sign system, can fix different ontological layers. The analysis of virtual space and its certain phenomena (such as “phenomena of iconic presence”, “the symbolism of identification”, and “the effect of ontological insufficiency”) can be realized from semiotic and philosophy of <b>sign</b> <b>position.</b> The revelation of such phenomena can help to develop the approach of analysis of ontological problems, the {{problems of}} virtual space and time, the problems of cyberspace.

40|$|In present time, the {{guidelines}} on warning <b>sign</b> <b>position</b> in the China National Standard lack detailed and standard regulations of placing warning signs on sharp curves, which may cause road safety problems. Therefore, this paper briefly discussed how {{to optimize the}} position of a warning sign on a sharp curve through a driving simulator experiment. This study concluded that a warning sign placed at different positions prior to a sharp curve will have different influence ranges for drivers approaching and negotiating the curve. Meanwhile, different positions of a warning sign imposed different effect obviously on the adjustment of vehicle's lane position on sharp curves with the same radius, especially at the midpoint of a sharp curve. The evaluation results of five positions (0 m, 50 m, 100 m, 200 m, and 400 m in advance) showed that only when the warning signs were placed 100 m or 200 m prior to sharp curves, can they achieve positive influence on driving behavior. On this basis, the authors look forward to providing rationalization proposals in selecting the best position of a warning sign on a sharp curve for the engineering implementation and national standard...|$|E

40|$|Speed is an {{important}} factor of road accidents. This paper focusses on changes and differences in speed of the traffic flow and on speed differences between different vehicles. Based on an international literature survey the relevance of the speed related factors for road safety are described. Road categorization and delineation of speed limit zones are identified as the most important tools to obtain a more homogeneous speed pattern. Based on a series of case studies including the different urbanization typologies, it is shown that regarding the implementation of these two planning concepts, little has been achieved in Flanders. The scattered and ribbon shaped urbanization along the secondary and local roads and the step by step adaptation of speed limits on road segments by the different road authorities, give rise to a manifest lack of homogeneity. Based on the Flemish Road Signs Database a quantitative analysis (e. g. relating to the length of segments, number of speed limit changes on a road section, etc.) could be carried out. The database contains all traffic signs relevant for speed limits on the entire road network in Flanders, including the road <b>sign</b> <b>position</b> and the description of its characteristics. Based on the case studies both an analysis of the existing situation as well as an explorative assessment of a generic scenario (entering a general speed limit of 70 km/h in non-built up areas instead of the current limit of 90 km /h were described. By implementing this scenario, six out of seven speed limit signs can be removed and the workload for the drivers can be reduced proportionately. So speed limit policy and zoning can be regarded as key instruments for more road safety on local and secondary roads...|$|E
