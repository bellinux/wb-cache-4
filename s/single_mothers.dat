5|$|The double {{burden that}} <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> endure has a {{historical}} precedent, and still exists currently. <b>Single</b> <b>mothers</b> usually have {{higher rates of}} employment and children at home, and have the highest levels overall of the double burden. Women also typically have less economic resources than men, and have no partner to share the workload with them. <b>Single</b> <b>mothers</b> fall heavily under economic vulnerability. They may face job discrimination and not earn as much, {{so there will be}} further difficulties in maintaining the double burden. Single-mother families tend to hover near the poverty line, with a poverty rate that is twice as high of that for men.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{economists have}} also {{highlighted}} power and inequality issues within families and households. For example, Randy Albelda shows that responsibility for care work influences the time poverty experienced by <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> in the United States. Similarly, Sarah Gammage examines {{the effects of}} unpaid care work performed by women in Guatemala. The work of the Equality Studies Department at University College Dublin {{such as that of}} Sara Cantillon has focused on inequalities of domestic arrangements within even affluent households.|$|E
5|$|The Misericorde Sisters {{were not}} well liked by the Montreal community. Throughout {{the early years}} of the Hospice de Sainte-Pélagie and the Institute, the {{locations}} in which Jetté and the Sisters worked were kept secret, in order to protect the <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> from public hostility towards prostitutes and unwed mothers. On some occasions when the Sisters brought newborns to church for baptism, garbage was thrown at them. People in prayer were reported to leave when the Sisters would enter the church.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} the contributions of college students' perceptions of family of origin health and self-esteem to {{their perceptions of the}} divorced <b>single</b> <b>mother.</b> It was hypothesized that individuals who hold more positive views of their family of origin health will also view themselves and, consequently, the divorced <b>single</b> <b>mother</b> more positively. Participants were 170 college students, 113 of whom lived only with their biological parents, and 57 of whom lived at sometime in their lives with a divorced <b>single</b> <b>mother.</b> Four instruments were used to collect the data, including the Family of Origin Health Scale (Hovestadt et al., 1985), the Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1965), the Perception of Divorced Mother Scale (Ganong & Coleman, 1983), and a demographic questionnaire. A series of hierarchical regression analyses were used in data analyses. Generally, results indicated that family type made no major impact on participants' perceptions of the divorced <b>single</b> <b>mother.</b> Among participants in the biological parent group and the divorced <b>single</b> <b>mother</b> group, family of origin health significantly predicted more positive perceptions of the divorced <b>single</b> <b>mother.</b> In this analysis, the regression model for the biological parent group was significant, while for the divorced <b>single</b> <b>mother</b> group it was not. Self-esteem was not found to contribute significantly to participants' perceptions of the divorced <b>single</b> <b>mother,</b> and thus did not mediate the relationship between family of origin health and perceptions of the divorced <b>single</b> <b>mother.</b> Finally, among the biological parent group, amount of interaction with single parent families headed by a divorced <b>single</b> <b>mother</b> significantly predicted more positive perceptions of the divorced <b>single</b> <b>mother.</b> Among the divorced <b>single</b> <b>mother</b> group, however, amount of time lived in a single parent family headed by a divorced mother did not significantly predict their perceptions of the divorced <b>single</b> <b>mother...</b>|$|R

5|$|Nora Belahcen Fitzgerald first {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} of creating an organization to help Morocco's underprivileged women through career training in 2006 after meeting a single mother begging on the street who lived on 2030 dirhams per day (about €2.70, $3.40 in 2006). Belahcen Fitzgerald was inspired by the Association Solidarité Féminine, which helps <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> overcome poverty and social stigma by providing them with shelter, counselling, and vocational training. She decided to begin helping women by teaching them to make baked goods in her family's language center. This proved to be successful, and the participants were able to make more money using their new skills than by begging. In 2008, Belahcen Fitzgerald began hiring underprivileged Moroccan women to cook for events she organized for her friends.|$|E
5|$|With Hitler's approval, Himmler {{intended}} {{that the}} new society of the Nazi regime should destigmatise illegitimate births, particularly of children fathered {{by members of the}} SS, who were vetted for racial purity. His hope was that each SS family would have between four and six children. The Lebensborn (Fountain of Life) association, founded by Himmler in 1935, created a series of maternity homes where <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> could be accommodated during their pregnancies. Both parents were examined for racial suitability before acceptance. The resulting children were often adopted into SS families. The homes were also made available to the wives of SS and NSDAP members, who quickly filled over half the available spots.|$|E
5|$|Family {{issues were}} {{significant}} concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, {{even though the}} general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother. Several studies performed {{as a result of}} custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same-sex parents compared to <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex roles of children who grow up with lesbian mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.|$|E

25|$|This {{means that}} {{households}} with a middle-aged householder were {{nearly twice as}} likely to own a home as those with a young householder. Overall married couple families with a householder age 70 to 74 had the highest homeownership rate with 93.3% being homeowners. The lowest homeownership rate was recorded for single females under the age of twenty-five of whom only 13.6%, were homeowners. Yet, single females had an overall higher homeownership rate than single males and <b>single</b> <b>mothers.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Canada, inequalities {{of access}} to social and {{economic}} resources contribute significantly to poverty levels across Canada, i.e., those in poverty are often First Nation people, immigrants and refugees, single adults {{between the ages of}} 45-64, and <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> with children, disabled, those in the lowest-paying jobs, full or part-time. People in poverty in Canada more often access food banks, are often homeless, or in low-cost, sub-standard housing; {{they are part of the}} 'working poor' who rely on low wages, or are stuck in the poverty trap of welfare, and face hunger.|$|E
25|$|At the time, <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> {{were the}} poorest sector in society, {{disadvantaged}} {{for at least}} four reasons. First, women had longer lifespans, often leaving them widowed with children. Second, women's work opportunities were few, and when they did find work, their wages were lower than male workers' wages. Third, women were often less likely to marry or remarry after being widowed, leaving them as the main providers for the remaining family members. Finally, poor women had deficient diets, because their husbands and children received disproportionately large shares of food. Many women were malnourished and had limited access to health care.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with general}} {{information}} on life for young men, Leykis's 101 advice mostly consists of his principles of {{looking out for}} oneself. He argues that {{the institution of marriage}} is flawed and that family court systems are often corrupt because DNA testing after childbirth is not mandatory to prevent paternity fraud, and because courts have forced men to pay child support even after DNA testing has established that a man was not actually a child's father. Other examples of Leykis 101 guidelines include never dating <b>single</b> <b>mothers</b> or co-workers; never cohabiting with a woman; using birth control during each sexual encounter; and immediately ending a relationship if a woman issues an ultimatum.|$|E
25|$|Single mother {{households}} are critical in addressing feminization {{of poverty and}} can be broadly defined as households {{in which there are}} female headships and no male headships. Single mother {{households are}} at the highest risk of poverty for women due to lack of Income and resources. There is a continuing increase of single mother households in the world, which results in higher percentages of women in poverty. <b>Single</b> <b>mothers</b> are the poorest women in society, and their children tend to be disadvantaged in comparison to their peers. Different factors can be taken into account for the {{rise in the number of}} female headship in households. When men become migrant workers, women are left to be the main caretaker of their homes. Other factors such as illnesses and deaths of husbands lead to an increase in single mother households in developing countries.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s, middle-class whites largely {{left the}} {{neighborhood}} of Hough in Cleveland, Ohio, and working-class African Americans moved in. By 1966, more than 66,000 people, nearly 90 percent of them African American, lived in Hough. Most businesses in the area remained white-owned, however. Residents of the Hough neighborhood complained extensively of inferior and racially segregated public schools, poor delivery of welfare benefits, a lack of routine garbage collection, no street cleaning, and too few housing inspections. Recreational facilities in Hough were nonexistent except for minimal equipment at a few school playgrounds. Hough was a relatively small area, but the population density in the neighborhood {{was one of the}} highest in Cleveland. Housing was often substandard in Hough, with a fifth of all housing units considered dilapidated and absentee landlords (most of them white) were common. The deindustrialization of Cleveland hit the African American community hard, and unemployment was over 17 percent. Median income for black residents was just 65 percent the median income of whites. Although Hough contained just 7.3 percent of Cleveland's population, it had more than 19 percent of its welfare cases. <b>Single</b> <b>mothers</b> (half of them teenagers) bore one-third of the children in Hough in 1966, and infant mortality was twice as high {{as the rest of the}} city. High unemployment and the rapid deterioration of the neighborhood created extensive racial tension in Hough. Although the city had engaged in some urban renewal housing projects in Hough, these had displaced more people than they housed and those displaced had received little to no help in finding new housing. Moreover, failed urban renewal to the east of Hough had displaced several thousand poor families, most of whom moved into Hough.|$|E
