40|$|Whole-body CO 2 {{stores are}} known to {{increase}} with cooling in reptiles and amphibians (-Δ[CO 2]/ΔT). The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the mechanism(s) producing this inverse relationship. The Δ[CO 2]/ΔT coefficients were determined for eight reptilian and one amphibian species and were found to differ by a factor of approximately 10, from - 0. 21 mmol kg- 1 °C- 1 in the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>spur-thighed</b> <b>tortoise</b> Testudo graeca to - 0. 02 mmol kg- 1 °C- 1 in the bullfrog Rana catesbeiana. The Δ[CO 2]/ΔT coefficients were correlated with values in the literature for in vivo plasma ΔpH/ΔT coefficients (Δ[CO 2]/ΔT=- 0. 18 [...] 8. 24 ΔpH/ΔT; r 2 = 0. 87). Plasma electrolyte concentrations (Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cl-, inorganic phosphate, SO 42 - and lactate), [protein], [CO 2], PCO 2 and pH were measured in chronically cannulated resting black racer snakes Coluber constrictor. When the temperature was reduced from 30 to 10 °C, pH increased slightly (by - 0. 0028 pH units °C- 1), PCO 2 decreased by 7 mmHg, [CO 2] increased by 3. 2 mmol l- 1 and [HPO 42 -+H 2 PO 4 -] increased by 0. 7 mmol l- 1. Concentrations of protein and of the remaining electrolytes were not significantly different (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) at 30 and 10 °C. Net plasma protein charge, calculated from the principle of electroneutrality (the sum of the cations in mequiv = the sum of anions in mequiv), was - 0. 48 mequiv g- 1 protein at 30 °C and - 0. 38 mequiv g- 1 protein at 10 °C.

40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) {{was developed}} {{for the detection of}} antibodies to a herpesvirus associated with an upper respiratory tract disease in <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>tortoises</b> [spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) and Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) ]. This serodiagnostic test was validated through a hyperimmunization study. The mean of the A 405 readings of the plasma samples collected at time zero of the hyperimmunization study plus three times the standard deviation was used as the cutoff for seropositivity in tortoises. ELISA results were compared to serum neutralization (SN) values for the same samples by using the McNemar test. The results obtained by SN and ELISA were not significantly different (P > 0. 05). This new ELISA could be used as an important diagnostic tool for screening wild populations and private and zoo collections of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>tortoises...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The spur-thighed {{tortoise}} (or Greek tortoise) (Testudo graeca) {{is one of}} five species of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>tortoise</b> (genus Testudo, family Testudinidae). The other four species are the Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni), Russian tortoise (Testudo horsfieldii), Egyptian tortoise (Testudo kleinmanni), and marginated tortoise (Testudo marginata). The {{spur-thighed tortoise}} is a very long lived animal, achieving a lifespan of upwards of 125 years, with some unverified reports of up to 200 years.|$|R
50|$|Kleinmann's {{tortoises}} become {{sexually mature}} when about 5 years old. In the wild, mating {{has only been}} observed in March, but in captivity, they mate in April and August to November. During courtship, the male will ram the female, sometimes chasing after her. Unlike any other <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>tortoise,</b> T. kleinmanni may make a mating call similar to {{the call of the}} mourning dove. Eggs are laid in shallow bowls beneath bushes, or in vacant burrows. Each clutch contains one to five eggs, which hatch in the summer or early autumn.|$|R
50|$|Different {{types of}} ground and {{distance}} from the water source determine different composition of biodiversity (Tadevosyan, 2001; 2002). Limestone rocks and their outcrops {{were found to be}} richest in diversity of vascular plants (102 species) and vertebrate animals. Habitats of spring beds support just some of the majority of plant and animal species. Rocks of different size and position {{on the surface of the}} ground create a kind of shell which protects the soil from fast and deep drying, the plants from losing humidity and relatively heavy-bodied vertebrate animals from overheating and from predators. The characteristic vegetation of this habitat is called phryganoids. Here one can encounter very dryness resistant (xerophylic) relatives of woody plants like Pallass's buckthorn (Rhamnus pallassii), white-hair cherry (Cerasus incana), dragon-head sage (Salvia dracocephaloides) etc., as well as relatively large animals which need reliable permanent shelters such as fox, <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>tortoise</b> (Testudo graeca rmeniaca), blunt nosed viper (Macrovipera lebetina obtusa), golden grass skink (Trachylepis septemlineatus transcaucasicus), Caucasian agama (Laudakia caucasia), etc. Many of organisms inhabiting rocky outcrops critically need rock cover for protection from predators, incubation and hibernation. Therefore, extensive travertine mining in the neighbourhoods of the reservation carries a serious threat to the biodiversity of rocklands.|$|R
40|$|To test phylogenetic {{relationships}} within the genus Testudo (Testudines: Testudinidae), we have sequenced {{a fragment of}} the mitochondrial (mt) 12 S rRNA gene of 98 tortoise specimens belonging to the genera Testudo, Indotestudo, and Geochelone. Maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining methods identify two main clades of <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>tortoises,</b> one composed of the species Testudo graeca, Testudo marginata, and Testudo kleinmanni and a second of Testudo hermanni, Testudo horsfieldii, and Indotestudo elongata. The first clade, but not the second, was also supported by maximum parsimony analysis. Together with the genus Geochelone, a star-like radiation of these clades was suggested, as a sister-group {{relationship between the two}} Testudo clades could not be confirmed. The intraspecies genetic variation was examined by sequencing the mt 12 S rRNA fragment from 28 specimens of T. graeca and 49 specimens of T. hermanni from various geographic locations. Haplotype diversity was found to be significantly larger in T. graeca compared with T. hermanni, suggestive of reduced genetic diversity in the latter species, perhaps due to Pleistocene glaciations affecting northern and middle Europe or other sources of lineage reduction. No ancient mt 12 S rRNA gene haplotypes were identified in T. graeca and/or T. hermanni originating from islands in the Mediterranean Sea, suggesting that these islands harbor tortoise populations introduced from the European and African mainland.

30|$|Desert fires {{can cause}} a {{decrease}} in the number of plant species as time since fire increases (Alford et al. 2005), but the response varies among plant species and is complicated by other factors like seed bank size, rainfall (Abella et al. 2009), competition, disturbance history, and nutrient availability (Rew and Johnson 2010). For example, fire can temporarily reduce the seed bank of less nutritious grasses like the exotic species red brome, but the exotic Mediterranean split grasses can quickly increase above pre-fire levels (Brooks 2002). The latter plant species, when eaten by tortoises, do not contain enough digestible nitrogen to compensate for nitrogen lost through excretion (Meienberger et al. 1993). If there was {{a decrease in the}} number of plant species with increasing time since fire, as suggested by Alford et al. (2005), and a decrease in native annual forbs as shown by others (Brooks 1999, Brooks and Esque 2002), tortoises might be expected to forage more widely (Oftedal et al. 2002) in search of preferred food plants (Henen 2002) over time. Again, this is not reflected in our data. Sanz-Aguilar et al. (2011) compared minimum convex polygons for the <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>tortoise</b> Testudo graeca, a species that lives in a fire-prone ecosystem, in burned and unburned areas and found no difference. They concluded that individuals living in burned areas did not have to increase their territories to feed. None of their tortoises moved from burned to unburned areas despite the small size of their study site (70 ha).|$|R
50|$|On Sardinia, a {{population}} of spur-thighed tortoises shares the small size, the yellow head spot, and the contrasting markings with the Tunisian population. Their taxonomic status is enigmatic, as is their very existence on the island, separated from North Africa by a considerable stretch of the <b>Mediterranean</b> which <b>tortoises</b> are hardly able to cross. There is a distinct local form of the marginated tortoise on the island, however, {{and that seems to}} have originated from a deliberate introduction by humans, perhaps by Greek or Roman landowners in the classical antiquity. While the local marginated tortoises show evidence of pronounced genetic drift and may thus justifiably regarded as a subspecies despite the absence of lineage sorting, the spur-thighed tortoises of Sardinia are probably best considered an introduced population not yet worthy of taxonomic separation pending further research.|$|R
40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} project to {{generate}} a mitochondrial database for terrestrial tortoises based on museum specimens, the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of 10 species and a {approx} 14 kb sequence from an eleventh species are reported. The sampling of the present study emphasizes <b>Mediterranean</b> <b>tortoises</b> (genus Testudo and their close relatives). Our new sequences are aligned, along with those of two testudinoid turtles from GenBank, Chrysemys picta and Mauremys reevesii, yielding an alignment of 14, 858 positions, of which 3, 238 are parsimony informative. We develop a phylogenetic taxonomy for Testudo and related species based on well-supported, diagnosable clades. Several well-supported nodes are recovered, including the monophyly of a restricted Testudo, T. kleinmanni + T. marginata (the Chersus clade), and the placement of the enigmatic African pancake tortoise (Malacochersustornieri) within the predominantly Palearctic greater Testudo group (Testudona tax. nov.). Despite the large amount of sequence reported, there is low statistical support for some nodes within Testudona and Sowe do not propose names for those groups. A preliminary and conservative estimation of divergence times implies a late Miocene diversification for the testudonan clade (6 - 12 million years ago), matching their first appearance in the fossil record. The multi-continental distribution of testudonan turtles {{can be explained by the}} establishment of permanent connections between Europe, Africa, and Asia at this time. The arrival of testudonan turtles to Africa occurred after one or more initial tortoise invasions gave rise to the diverse (> 25 species) 'Geochelone complex. 'Two unusual genomic features are reported for the mtDNA of one tortoise, M. tornieri: (1) nad 4 has a shift of reading frame that we suggest is resolved by translational frameshifting of the mRNA on the ribosome during protein synthesis and (2) there are two copies of the control region and trnF, with the latter having experienced multiple nucleotide substitutions in a pattern suggesting that each is being maintained by selection...|$|R
40|$|Climatic shifts may {{increase}} the extinction risk of populations, especially when they are already suffering from other anthropogenic impacts. Our ability to predict the consequences of climate change on endangered species is limited by our scarce knowledge {{of the effects of}} climate variability on the population dynamics of most organisms and by the uncertainty of climate projections, which depend strongly on the region of the earth being considered. In this study, we analysed a long-term monitoring programme (1988 – 2009) of Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) aimed at evaluating the consequences of the drastic changes in temperature and precipitation patterns predicted for the Mediterranean region on the demography of a long-lived species with low dispersal capability and already suffering a large number of threats. Capture–recapture modelling of a population in the Ebro Delta (NESpain) allowed us to assess the effect of climate variability on the survival of tortoises. Winter rainfall was found to be the major driver of juvenile and immature survival, whereas that of adults remained high and constant across the study. Furthermore, local climate series obtained ad hoc from regional climate simulations, for this and 10 additional <b>Mediterranean</b> locations where <b>tortoises</b> occurred, provided us with reliable future climate forecasts, which were used to simulate the fate of these populations under three precipitation scenarios (mean, wet and dry) using stochastic population modelling. We show that a shift to a more arid climate would have negative consequences for population persistence, enhancing juvenile mortality and increasing quasiextinction risk because of a decrease in recruitment. These processes varied depending on the population and the climate scenario we considered, but our results suggest that unless other human-induced causes of mortality are suppressed (e. g. poaching, fire, habitat fragmentation), climate variability will increase extinction risk within most of the species’ current range.
