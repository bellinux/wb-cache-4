2500|$|Several months later, she {{composed}} a little mantra or affirmative prayer which she <b>said</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> [...] "I am the living witness: The dead live: And they speak through {{us and to}} us: And I am the voice that gives this glorious truth to the suffering world: I am ready, God: I am ready, Christ: I am ready, Robert." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you <b>said,</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, Terence, {{that you}} will be able to ride, and drive, and get about like other people, in time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thee'll see thy father, little one. Does thee know it? Thy {{father is}} coming," [...] she <b>said,</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, {{as the boy}} looked wonderingly at her.|$|E
60|$|Happy Jack <b>said</b> this <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> {{as he sat}} in {{the maple}} tree, trying to decide what was to be done.|$|R
6000|$|... "Little Miss Fuzzytail!" [...] Peter <b>said</b> it <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, {{as he sat}} on the sunning-bank in the {{far corner}} of the Old Pasture, where Tommy Tit the Chickadee had left him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you not <b>said</b> it <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again? Have you not {{declared}} {{how good}} a thing {{it would be that}} Lord Hampstead should die? You cannot go back from all that, Lady Kingsbury." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{only knew}} {{what had become of}} him," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over.</b> [...] "But perhaps he is dead!" [...] And the tears started to his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Things {{are very}} bad," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again. [...] "It {{would be better}} for you all to go away. Why does your officer stop here, to be killed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know as {{much about}} him as a woman can know of a man she doesn't know,--and all from yourself. You have <b>said</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again {{that he is a}} 'rascal!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] said Miss Dewey. [...] "If I {{could get}} rid of Hen, I could manage well enough with mother. Mr. Wemmel would marry me if I could get the divorce. He's <b>said</b> so <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you do talk such stuff," [...] Sid said. [...] "Last {{night you}} said, 'It's blood, it's blood, that's what it is!' You <b>said</b> that <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over.</b> <b>And</b> you <b>said,</b> 'Don't torment me so--I'll tell!' Tell WHAT? What is it you'll tell?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Jimmy {{went off}} to deliver his reply, and Old Mr. Toad sat and puffed himself out until he could hardly breathe. [...] "Honor him by dining with him," [...] <b>said</b> he <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> to himself. [...] "I never was so flattered in my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|He did not {{proclaim}} even {{to himself}} what dreadful {{thing he was}} going to do, but as he left the Elevated he <b>said</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> shaking his closed fist inside his coat pocket: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My own, own darling girl," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, as {{he pressed}} {{her to his}} heart, quite {{regardless}} of Mrs. Bell, who stood by, sobbing with joy. [...] "My own Susan." ...|$|E
6000|$|Danny Meadow Mouse {{watched him}} go {{and shook his head}} in disapproval. [...] "Foolish, foolish, foolish!" [...] he <b>said</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> to himself. [...] "Why can't Peter be content with the good things that he has?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs Boffin wept most heartily, {{and embraced}} her with all fondness; but said {{not one single}} word except that she was her dear girl. She said that often enough, to be sure, for she <b>said</b> it <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again; but not one word else.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm a squirrel," [...] responded the other. [...] "I've <b>said</b> so <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, but {{you will}} go on {{worrying}} me! My only wish is that I could bring my tail {{just a little more}} to the right so as to hide my head and paws altogether from you." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the after}} wars which England waged, in India, {{the truth of}} what Charlie <b>said</b> was <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again proved. Numerous fortresses, {{supposed}} by the natives to be absolutely impregnable, and far exceeding in strength that just described, have been carried by assault, by the dash and daring of English troops.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was right," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> to himself, [...] "I was right. I {{was sure}} {{there must be}} a hole in this tree. It is one of the old houses of Drummer the Woodpecker. Now I am safe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bear malice!" [...] said Mrs Truman, who {{had just}} walked up. [...] "No, no. Why, Parson Harford have <b>said</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, when he gave a {{shilling}} or so or a meat order, to help a poor lady that was ill, that 'twas by madam's wish." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{she used}} to pretend she did not believe you would. But I knew better. I knew that when she <b>said,</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, 'Is my father never coming for me?' she was {{thinking}} of somebody else. And are you come to take her away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Again {{he began}} the repetition, saying it very loud <b>and</b> plain; he <b>said</b> it <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> till his mind wandered far out to sea, and while his tongue {{repeated}} [...] "penna, pennæ," [...] he was counting the white sails of the fishing-smacks, and thinking of pulling up codfish at the Banks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I was {{a little}} scared," [...] said Dora primly, [...] "but I held tight to Anne's hand <b>and</b> <b>said</b> my prayers <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} has come to the master," [...] <b>said</b> the archdeacon <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again. [...] "He used to be ready enough to stand up for his order." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{regard the}} present state of affairs," [...] he <b>said,</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, [...] "as a {{judgment}} upon the city, for its base ingratitude to the brave admiral, and I am convinced that things will never come right, until we have him again in command of our fleet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm right; I know I am. Of course I can't give up here; it's {{a matter}} of principle, of honor," [...] he <b>said</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> to himself. [...] "Perhaps if Lillie had been here I never should have taken such a pledge; but as I have, there's no help for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'We {{must get}} out of this place,' I <b>said</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over.</b> 'I have made my choice, and I will have no hand in these troubles. I will have nothing of this war. We have taken our lives out of all these things. This is no refuge for us. Let us go.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{notes in}} her {{assessment}} of the review, [...] "I’ve <b>said</b> this <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> but {{one of my favorite}} things this season are the Camelot outfits. I also love how Regina is dressed routinely in red while Emma is dressed in white: similar to how their wardrobe choices reflected their intentions back in the first season." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will think}} of it," [...] he <b>said</b> very gravely, <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again. Beyond that [...] "we {{will think of}} it" [...] {{he could not be}} induced to utter a word.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{must not}} get away," [...] he <b>said,</b> to himself, <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again. [...] "We must capture him {{and make him}} take us to where the gang have Uncle Barnaby a prisoner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would give}} {{anything}} if it hadn't happened, father, {{and he really}} seemed a nice fellow. He <b>said</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again he didn't want to hurt us, and I am sure he didn't, only he thought he oughtn't to let us pass, and as we would go on {{he had to stop}} us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would do}} father an immense deal of good if {{something}} {{were to happen}} that would wake him up a bit and get him to {{take an interest in}} things," [...] he had <b>said</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again to Marion. [...] "I cannot understand a man having no opinion of his own about anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is what I do think," [...] the clergyman replied. [...] "You {{know how}} she <b>said</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again that she was {{determined}} somehow to find the will. Well, I believe that she has in some way in pursuance of that purpose gone as a servant to the Penfolds. Now, my dear, {{you will not be}} surprised that I found it somewhat difficult to keep my thoughts from wandering." ...|$|E
6000|$|The man {{hesitated a}} moment. Then {{he began to}} plead hard for reconsideration. But Herminia's mind was made up. She couldn't belie her past; she couldn't be false to the {{principles}} for whose sake she had staked and lost everything. [...] "No, no," [...] she <b>said</b> firmly, <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again. [...] "You must take me my own way, or you must go without me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They have <b>said</b> so <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, <b>and</b> {{nothing has}} come of it. For my part, I don't care which way it goes. After the muddle {{that was made}} of it thirty years ago {{it does not seem}} to me more likely that we shall get rid of the Hanoverians now. Besides, the hangings and slaughterings then, would, I should think, make the nobles and the heads of clans think twice ere they risked {{everything}} again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{you said}} you'd keep me here until I confessed," [...] {{returned}} Anne wearily, [...] "and so I decided to confess because I {{was bound to}} get to the picnic. I thought out a confession last night after I went to bed and made it as interesting as I could. <b>And</b> I <b>said</b> it <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> so that I wouldn't forget it. But you wouldn't {{let me go to the}} picnic after all, so all my trouble was wasted." ...|$|R
