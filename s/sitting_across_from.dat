Several hours later, {{she wakes up}} to see her father <b>sitting</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> her, {{speaking}} silently. The telephone rings, and after looking at the phone, she finds the chair empty again. She answers the call—from her mother, who tells her that her father {{died of a heart}} attack an hour earlier.|$|E
5|$|On the airplane, Jack jokingly tells {{a flight}} {{attendant}} named Cindy (Kimberley Joseph) that his alcoholic drink is not strong, and {{she gives him a}} stronger one. Charlie runs by while being called after by flight attendants before turbulence shakes the plane, scaring Rose, who is <b>sitting</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> Jack. The two talk, and Rose mentions that her husband is in the bathroom. The plane gets exceptionally shaky, causing a man to hit the plane's ceiling and oxygen masks to fall.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to the mythology, {{the early}} {{moments of the}} March—getting there—was no picnic. People were afraid. We didn't know what we would meet. There was no precedent. <b>Sitting</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> me was a black preacher with a white collar. He was an AME preacher. We talked. Every now and then, people on the bus sang 'Oh Freedom' and 'We Shall Overcome,' {{but for the most}} part there wasn't a whole bunch of singing. We were {{secretly}} praying that nothing violent happened.|$|E

[...] Ne-Yo further stated that Rihanna is not afraid to trying new things and from the first moment she heard the song he knew she would like it, [...] "I trust Rihanna to be Rihanna, and she trusts me to be me. That's the coolest thing about our relationship. I must say this song is a step in somewhat of a different direction for both of us." [...] When Harmony heard the song, both he and Ne-Yo were aware that they should change some elements and that it had to be darker and edgier.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Rihanna {{was signed}} to Rogers' and Carl Sturken's {{production}} company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions, who assigned her a lawyer and manager, before the completed demo tape was distributed to various record labels {{around the world in}} late 2004. The first to respond to the demo tape was Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam Recordings. Rihanna auditioned for him and music mogul L.A. Reid in his office.

500|$|Prior to {{signing a}} record deal with Def Jam Recordings, Rihanna was {{discovered}} in her home country of Barbados by American record producer Evan Rogers, who made the necessary arrangements for her to fly to New York. There, she recorded a collection of demos for a demo tape {{to be sent to}} record labels. One of the demos recorded was that of [...] "Pon de Replay", which was written and produced by Carl Sturken, Evan Rogers and Vada Nobles in 2004.

Initially, Jay-Z was skeptical about signing Rihanna, because he felt [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] was too big for her, saying [...] "when a song is that big, it's hard [...] to come back from. I don't sign songs, I sign artists". [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] was released via iTunes on July 26, 2005, through Def Jam Recordings.|$|E

Once there, she referred to her Cape Cod-style home, at 79 First Avenue in Massapequa Park, as her [...] "country house" [...] and hung out in Greenwich Village, meeting people through the circle of Seymour Levy, on Bleecker Street.|$|E
2500|$|The DeKalb Depot, {{also known}} as the DeKalb Avenue Depot or DeKalb Avenue Shops, was located {{on the east side of}} DeKalb Avenue between Onderdonk and Seneca Avenues in Ridgewood, Queens. It was built as a trolley barn by the Brooklyn City Railroad in the early 20th Century, later {{becoming}} part of the BRT/BMT system. It served several streetcar lines, including the DeKalb Avenue Line (today's [...] ), while its shops performed heavy maintenance.

The site is now occupied by a supermarket, <b>sitting</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> the athletic field of Grover Cleveland High School.|$|E
60|$|The {{induction}} {{services were}} interesting, and Mary Isabel enjoyed them. Doctor Hamilton was <b>sitting</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> her and {{once or twice}} she caught him looking at her admiringly. The doctor noticed the hat and the grey silk and wondered how Mary Isabel {{had managed to get}} her own way concerning them. What a pretty woman she was! Really, he had never realized before how very pretty she was. But then, he had never seen her except in a sunbonnet or with her hair combed primly back.|$|E

50|$|Even {{with the}} absence of a law {{defining}} the role of the Opposition Leader, it is customary to conduct update meetings between the Prime Minister {{and the chairman of the}} largest party not within the government. However, such meetings are carried out mostly according to the Prime Minister's decision. Established precedent has also led for the Leader of the Opposition usually <b>sitting</b> directly <b>across</b> <b>from</b> the Prime Minister in the Congress seating plan. It is not required for a Leader of the Opposition to held the post of deputy in Congress—Antonio Hernández Mancha held the office without having a seat in Congress, though he was a senator.|$|R

5000|$|After {{the second}} game, a new game called [...] "One on One" [...] was {{played with the}} four impostors from earlier. One fact had been {{purposely}} withheld from the panel {{about one of the}} impostors and it was up to the panelists to determine correctly to which of the impostors it applied. One at a time, each panelist would be given twenty seconds to question the impostor <b>sitting</b> directly <b>across</b> <b>from</b> them and would then say whether he/she believed the fact applied to that impostor. Wrong votes still paid $100 with $500 paid if the panel did not correctly determine to whom the fact pertained.|$|R
5000|$|In 1965, the <b>sitting</b> stands <b>across</b> <b>from</b> the honorary stands were renamed to the [...] "Reyenoldstribune" [...] {{in honor}} of legendary head coach Jack Reynolds who served 25 years at the club.

60|$|When our Italian hosts {{had offered}} me wine {{in a general}} sort of way, I had declined. My beer {{experience}} had been enough for me, and I had no inclination to traffic further in the stuff, or in anything related to it. Unfortunately, one young Italian, Peter, an impish soul, seeing me sitting solitary, stirred by a whim of the moment, half-filled a tumbler with wine and passed it to me. He was <b>sitting</b> <b>across</b> the table <b>from</b> me. I declined. His face grew stern, and he insistently proffered the wine. And then terror descended upon me--a terror which I must explain.|$|R
