5|$|Although it can {{be found}} in {{elevations}} up to about , it is far more commonly found in humid lowland areas, and most often observed in subtropical, marshy regions of its range. It is also frequently found in shrublands, woodlands, agricultural fields, and mangroves, often adjacent to water, such as rivers, streams, rice paddies, and ditches. It may also sometimes be found in villages and <b>suburban</b> <b>areas.</b> It is able to survive in other habitats also.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} of South Bend declined after 1960, {{when it had}} a peak {{population of}} 132,445.

Today, the largest industries in South Bend are health care, education, small business, and tourism. Remaining large corporations include Crowe Horwath, Honeywell, and AM General.|$|E
5|$|Though exotic birds such as parrots and parakeets {{are also}} found in the Everglades, their impact is negligible. Conversely, perhaps the animal that causes the most damage to native {{wildlife}} is the domestic or feral cat. Across the U.S., cats are responsible for approximately a billion bird deaths annually. They are estimated to number 640 per square mile; cats living in <b>suburban</b> <b>areas</b> have devastating effects on migratory birds and marsh rabbits.|$|E
5|$|A {{predominantly}} saprophytic species, Morchella rufobrunnea fruit bodies grow singly or {{in clusters}} in disturbed soil or woodchips used in landscaping. Large numbers can appear {{the year after}} wood mulch has been spread on the ground. Typical disturbed habitats include fire pits, near compost piles, logging roads, and dirt basements. Fruiting usually occurs in the spring, although fruit bodies {{can be found in}} these habitats most of the year. Other preferred habitats include steep slopes and plateaus, and old-growth conifer forests. In Cyprus, the fungus is frequently reported from coastal, urban and <b>suburban</b> <b>areas</b> under olive trees (Olea europaea).|$|E

5|$|Between the 1940s and the 1970s, {{the city}} saw {{significant}} growth in <b>suburban</b> <b>areas</b> from population migration. Veterans were returning from military service {{in large numbers}} seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs, {{a part of the}} local industry that was expanding rapidly. Advancements in architecture also contributed to the suburban boom. New, modernized shopping centers and the Interstate Highway System allowed workers to commute greater distances and families to live further from the downtown area. More than 127,000 homes were built in Montgomery County during the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Reynolds v. Sims that state {{legislative}} seats must be apportioned {{on the principle}} of one man, one vote. A number of state legislatures, including Maryland, had systems based on geography rather than population, and the court rules that this violated the 14th Amendment. Disproportionate population growth across Maryland since 1838 meant that the principle of one seat per county gave the voters of some counties, such as those on the eastern shore, disproportionate representation. Other counties, especially those in <b>suburban</b> <b>areas,</b> were underrepresented.|$|E
