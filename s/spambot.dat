25|$|Forum spam is the {{creation}} of advertising messages on Internet forums. It is generally done by automated spambots. Most forum spam consists of links to external sites, with the dual goals of increasing search engine visibility in highly competitive areas such as weight loss, pharmaceuticals, gambling, pornography, real estate or loans, and generating more traffic for these commercial websites. Some of these links contain code to track the spambot's identity; if a sale goes through, the spammer behind the <b>spambot</b> works on commission.|$|E

2500|$|Critics have {{described}} dril's voice as an amalgamation of ordinary Internet users, {{most of all}} those who are arrogant, ignorant, or hapless. According to The A.V. Clubs Clayton Purdom, dril is a sort of patron saint of Internet users, or [...] "your uncle's search history come to life and filtered through a scabrous comic sensibility, and ... possibly the most popular, beloved man on the entire internet (after, maybe, The Rock)." [...] Will Shaw of The Oxford Student noted the familiarity of dril's [...] "naive appeals to moderation" [...] and [...] "flame war posturing," [...] and said dril [...] "is the internet's collective id, given form. He's the internet equivalent of the Beowulf-poet; we may never know who he really is, but we recognise when he is being channelled." [...] Christine Erickson at Mashable said dril's character was like [...] "a <b>spambot</b> equivalent to the kind of crazy that Clint Eastwood portrays." [...] At Kotaku, Gita Jackson called dril a [...] "joke account that also inadvertently catalogues ... every way to be mad online." ...|$|E
50|$|E-mail <b>spambots</b> harvest e-mail {{addresses}} from material {{found on the}} Internet {{in order to build}} mailing lists for sending unsolicited e-mail, also known as spam. Such <b>spambots</b> are web crawlers that can gather {{e-mail addresses}} from websites, newsgroups, special-interest group (SIG) postings, and chat-room conversations. Because e-mail addresses have a distinctive format, such <b>spambots</b> are easy to code.|$|R

30|$|The {{problem of}} junk email or spam was {{recognized}} as early as 1975 [1, 2]. In 2010, Symantec reported that 89 % of email messages were spam [3], while 88 % of spam activity was attributed to <b>spambots</b> [4]. The existence of <b>spambots</b> is attributed {{to the existence of}} insecure software on the production side and lack of patching or adoption of security software, e.g., anti-virus software, by end-users (or consumers). This, however, does not (completely) explain why the percentage of <b>spambots</b> is different across countries. Some countries, such as India, always have a high proportion of <b>spambots,</b> and others, e.g., Sweden, do not. Unlike other bot activities, <b>spambots</b> need to be online for a shorter period of time. Thus, all bots are equally valued for sending spam [3]; bots with poor Internet connectivity, such as those in India, are as valuable as those in Sweden, which are likely to have more persistent connections.|$|R

40|$|Web robots {{have been}} widely used for various {{beneficial}} and malicious activities. Web <b>spambots</b> are a type of web robot that spreads spam content throughout the web by typically targeting Web 2. 0 applications. They are intelligently designed to replicate human behaviour in order to bypass system checks. Spam content not only wastes valuable resources but can also mislead users to unsolicited websites and award undeserved search engine rankings to spammers' campaign websites. While most of the research in anti-spam filtering focuses on the identification of spam content on the web, only a few have investigated the origin of spam content, hence identification and detection of web <b>spambots</b> still remains an open area of research. In this paper, we describe an automated supervised machine learning solution which utilises web navigation behaviour to detect web <b>spambots.</b> We propose a new feature set (referred to as an action set) as a representation of user behaviour to differentiate web <b>spambots</b> from human users. Our experimental results show that our solution achieves a 96. 24 % accuracy in classifying web <b>spambots...</b>|$|R

40|$|Web <b>spambots</b> are a {{new type}} of {{internet}} robot that spread spam content through Web 2. 0 applications like online discussion boards, blogs, wikis, social networking platforms etc. These robots are intelligently designed to act like humans in order to fool safeguards and other users. Such spam content not only wastes valuable resources and time but also may mislead users with unsolicited content. Spam content typically intends to misinform users (scams), generate traffic, make sales (marketing/advertising), and occasionally compromise parties, people or systems by spreading spyware or malwares. Current countermeasures do not effectively identify and prevent web <b>spambots.</b> Proactive measures to deter <b>spambots</b> from entering a site are limited to question / response scenarios. The remaining efforts then focus on spam content identification as a passive activity. Spammers have evolved their techniques to bypass existing anti-spam filters. In this paper, we describe a rule-based web usage behaviour action string that can be analysed using Trie data structures to detect web <b>spambots.</b> Our experimental results show the proposed system is successful for on-the-fly classification of web <b>spambots</b> hence eliminating spam in web 2. 0 applications. 1...|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, the spam links {{are posted}} in the user's {{signature}}, {{in which case}} the <b>spambot</b> will never post. The link sits quietly in the signature field, where it {{is more likely to be}} harvested by search engine spiders than discovered by forum administrators and moderators.|$|E
50|$|Ronson then {{records the}} {{interaction}} and posts it on YouTube, and is {{surprised when the}} reaction is overwhelmingly in his favor.

30|$|We {{make three}} assumptions. First, {{we assume that}} spam and only spam are caught by the two filter systems, i.e., no spam gets let through accidentally and {{legitimate}} messages do get tossed away accidentally. Second, we assume that IP addresses and hostnames correspond to <b>spambots</b> and are not spoofed. Third, we assume that all the spam was sent by <b>spambots.</b>|$|R

50|$|A <b>spambot</b> is a {{computer}} program designed {{to assist in the}} sending of spam. Spambots usually create accounts and send spam messages with them. Web hosts and website operators have responded by banning spammers, leading to an ongoing struggle between them and spammers in which spammers find new ways to evade the bans and anti-spam programs, and hosts counteract these methods.|$|E
50|$|Most forum spam {{consists}} of links to external sites with the dual goals of increasing search engine visibility in highly competitive advertising domains such as weight loss, pharmaceuticals, gambling, pornography, real estate or loans, and generating more traffic for these commercial websites. Some of these links may contain code {{to track the}} spambot's identity so that if a sale goes through then the spammer behind the <b>spambot</b> can collect a commission.|$|E
30|$|The {{percentage}} of systems acting as <b>spambots</b> {{in a country}} is, however, not statistically correlated with all measures of availability. In fact, only {{the total number of}} fixed broadband Internet subscribers (FBIS) was statistically correlated with the {{percentage of}} <b>spambots</b> (Table 4). FBIS was also the only statistically significant measure of availability in the regression model (Table 6). This indicates that higher adoption may lead to higher percentage of <b>spambots.</b> This is contrary to previous work by Eeten et al. [25], who found that while bigger ISPs might do worse in total volume of spam, they perform marginally better in terms of percentages. ISPs and national economies may then differ in this respect. Alternatively, the difference might be an artifact of the countries under analysis; Eeten et al. [25] concentrated on OECD countries.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{programs}} and approaches have been devised to foil <b>spambots.</b> One such technique is address munging, in which an e-mail address is deliberately modified so that a human reader (and/or human-controlled web browser) can interpret it but <b>spambots</b> cannot. This {{has led to the}} evolution of more sophisticated <b>spambots</b> that are able to recover e-mail addresses from character strings that appear to be munged, or instead can render the text into a web browser and then scrape it for e-mail addresses. Alternative transparent techniques include displaying {{all or part of the}} e-mail address on a web page as an image, a text logo shrunken to normal size using inline CSS, or as text with the order of characters jumbled, placed into readable order at display time using CSS.|$|R

50|$|Andrew Leonard, in {{his book}} Bots: The Origin of New Species, also credits HipCrime with {{creating}} the earliest web-distributed <b>spambot.</b> This bot, known as HipCrime's ActiveAgent, was a Java applet which allowed anybody with a web browser to send mass volumes of unsolicited e-mail messages. The ActiveAgent has since been expanded into an open source application (known as MarketCom's MktAgent) and is relied upon heavily by the largest e-mail spam stock pump and dump gangs.|$|E
50|$|Since November 2006, a very {{destructive}} forum and wiki spam attack {{has been}} propagated by inserting into comments redirect domains with an automated posting script like XRumer. These domains redirect a user to pornographic websites. If a user clicks {{on the image}} or attempts to close the Website an ActiveX codec will be downloaded as a Zlob Trojan. The <b>spambot</b> can often bypass many of the safeguards administrators use {{to reduce the amount}} of spam posted.|$|E

50|$|Forum <b>spambots</b> {{surf the}} web looking for guestbooks, wikis, blogs, forums {{and any other}} web forms to submit spam links to. These <b>spambots</b> often use OCR {{technology}} to bypass CAPTCHAs present. Some spam messages are targeted towards readers and can involve techniques of target marketing or even phishing. These automated schemes can {{make it more difficult}} for users to tell real posts from the bot generated ones. Some spam messages also simply contain tags and hyperlinks intended to boost search engine ranking rather than target human readers.|$|R
5000|$|Flood control forces {{users to}} wait for a short {{interval}} between making posts to the forum, thus preventing <b>spambots</b> from overwhelming the forum with repeated spam messages.|$|R
50|$|Another, more {{malicious}} use of bots is {{the coordination}} {{and operation of}} an automated attack on networked computers, such as a denial-of-service attack by a botnet. Internet bots {{can also be used}} to commit click fraud and more recently have seen usage around MMORPG games as computer game bots. A <b>spambot</b> is an internet bot that attempts to spam large amounts of content on the Internet, usually adding advertising links. More than 94.2% of websites have experienced a bot attack.|$|E
50|$|The {{infomercial}} {{consists of}} various students giving testimonies of their success, owing {{it to the}} school, literally named For-Profit Online University. Students pay for knowledge instead of attending traditional classes, and are offered jobs as 'Digital Gardeners,' solving CATPCHA for digital currency. The later half of the special introduces the threat of an evil rogue <b>spambot</b> named Howard, who was bribed with a large sum of ThoughtCoins, a digital currency used through the school, {{in an attempt to}} placate him.|$|E
50|$|In the introduction, Ronson relates a {{story of}} an {{automated}} parody Twitter handle, @jon_ronson (Ronson's twitter username is actually @jonronson). The account posts a smattering of food and party-related tweets, none of which {{are related to the}} content of the actual Jon Ronson's life. This leads to Ronson asking the bot's creators for its removal, as he believes it to be a <b>spambot.</b> The creators of the account call it an infomorph, and decline Ronson's request, but eventually agree to meet in person with the author.|$|E

30|$|Security (or guardianship), i.e., secure Internet server (SIS), was {{directly}} correlated {{with both the}} relative volume of spam from a country {{as well as the}} percentage of <b>spambots</b> in individual countries (Table 4). These correlations were statistically significant. However, SIS was not significant in the regression model for the relative volume for spam (Table 5). It may be that the relationship between SIS and relative volumes of spam is not linear as Spearman’s coefficient indicates both linear and non-linear correlations. SIS was, however, significant in explaining the percentage of <b>spambots</b> in individual countries (Table 6).|$|R
