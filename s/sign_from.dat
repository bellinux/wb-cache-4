5|$|Meanwhile, Jack's Valentine's dinner {{plans with}} his girlfriend Elisa (Salma Hayek) are {{postponed}} {{when they have to}} attend church.

After horrifying the priest (Zak Orth) with his admissions, Elisa becomes furious with Jack and breaks up with him. Later, however, she laments her fight with Jack. After finding a McFlurry coupon in the collection plate, she believes it is a <b>sign</b> <b>from</b> God because both she and Jack love the McDonald's dessert. The two reconcile their relationship as a result, and spend Valentine's Day together at a McDonald's.|$|E

25|$|In the 1984 film Ghostbusters, Ladder Company 8's {{house at}} 14 North Moore Street in Tribeca was {{featured}} as {{the headquarters of}} the Ghostbusters.

While the firehouse served as the set for exterior scenes, the interior of the Ghostbusters base was shot in a Los Angeles studio, and in Fire Station No. 23, a decommissioned Los Angeles firehouse. Ladder 8 has the <b>sign</b> <b>from</b> Ghostbusters II mounted on the wall inside the house, and is more or less resigned to fans of the franchise stopping by to take photos of the building and asking to pose with the sign.|$|E
25|$|Many folk {{practices}} may be identified, {{though few}} of them are specific to the Alevis. In this connection, scholar Martin van Bruinessen notes a <b>sign</b> <b>from</b> Turkey's Ministry of Religion, attached to Istanbul's shrine of Eyüp Sultan, which presents...a long list of ‘superstitious’ practices that are emphatically declared to be non-Islamic and objectionable, such as lighting candles or placing ‘wishing stones’ on the tomb, tying pieces of cloth to the shrine or to the trees in front of it, throwing money on the tomb, asking the dead directly for help, circling seven times around {{the trees in the}} courtyard or pressing one’s face against the walls of the türbe in the hope of a supernatural cure, tying beads to the shrine and expecting supernatural support from them, sacrificing roosters or turkeys as a vow to the shrine. The list is probably an inventory of common local practices the authorities wish to prevent from re-emerging.Other, similar practices include kissing door frames of holy rooms; not stepping on the threshold of holy buildings; seeking prayers from reputed healers; and making lokma and sharing it with others.|$|E
