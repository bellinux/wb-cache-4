40|$|We {{analyze the}} effect of an {{emergence}} of biofuel industry on the Conservation Reserve Program. The government expenditure on Conservation Reserve Program needs to increase dramatically to keep the current scale of CRP program when the biofuel industry is considered. We propose {{that the development of}} bioenergy crops on expiring CRP land is a potential way to reconcile the conflict between a sharp increase in government CRP budget and its environmental protection goal. CRP program can also be combined with the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) to achieve the goal of environmental protection and low carbon society at the same time.

40|$|The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) {{has played}} a key role in {{reducing}} soil erosion, improving water quality and protecting wildlife habitat. Rising crop prices, partly induced by the expansion of biofuel production, is likely to increase the maintenance cost of the program. This study develops a dynamic, multi-market, mathematical program to estimate the cost of maintaining CRP enrollment at the 2007 level in Illinois over 2007 - 2020 under exogenously given ethanol prices. We conduct the analysis under three policy scenarios, including the existing CRP policy and two modified policies that provide subsidies to induce energy crop production on expiring CRP land. We also explore the mix of biofuels produced from corn and various cellulosic feedstocks over this period under these policies. Our results show that in the presence of biofuels, to maintain CRP enrollment at the 2007 level, government expenditure would increase by as much as $ 0. 1 - 3. 9 billion depending on ethanol prices over the 2007 - 2020 compared to a no-biofuel baseline. If the government allows farmers to grow perennial energy crops on retired CRP land and provides existing <b>soil</b> <b>rental</b> payments, it will lead to a 37. 7 % ($ 2. 3 billion) reduction in the maintenance cost relative to the existing CRP policy. If the subsidy provided is similar to those under the Biomass Cro...|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of whether tenancy influences soil conservation decisions is, as Soule, Tegene, and Wiebe have noted, one of the classic questions of economics. It is well established in the theoretical literature that farmland owners tend to have strong incentives to conserve soil {{as a means of}} protecting the value of their land over the long run. It is equally well established that renters tend to have insufficiently strong incentives for conserving soil adequately. Renters have use of a plot of land only temporarily, and thus concern themselves with investment in maintaining productivity only over the expected life of the rental contract (including anticipated renewals). Moreover, since more erosive farming methods are frequently more profitable in the short run, renters typically have incentives to disinvest in soil, that is, mine soils excessively (see for example McConnell). The empirical literature on adoption of soil conservation measures has produced ambiguous results regarding the influence of tenancy. Some studies have found weak evidence indicating less <b>soil</b> conservation on <b>rental</b> land. Norris and Batie found a weak negative correlation between rented landâ€™s share of total acreage operated and Virgini...|$|R
