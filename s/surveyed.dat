5|$|On October 25, 1788 Jones' team {{began their}} survey of Grimsby Township; it was {{completed}} November 13, 1788. Saltfleet Township was <b>surveyed</b> from November 14, 1788 to December 25, 1788 and Binbrook Township was <b>surveyed</b> from December 24, 1788 until February 12, 1789. All of these townships were <b>surveyed</b> using the Front and Rear system, except Binbrook, which was <b>surveyed</b> with the Single Front system. During this time, Frey had assigned two other surveyors to lead surveys in the Nassau district. Daniel Hazen and Jesse Pawling both led teams, but neither group was {{as busy as}} Jones' group. Hazen's group <b>surveyed</b> only four townships, and incompletely, and Pawling's three, also incompletely. In November 1789 Jones began acting as the deputy surveyor in Nassau District as Frey had left Upper Canada, and he officially received the position in early 1791 {{on the order of}} Deputy Surveyor General John Collins.|$|E

Deputy Assistant Directors - <b>Survey</b> were appointed to Military District Headquarters to advise on <b>survey</b> needs and to liaise with State agencies. In April 1940 the 2/1 Corps Field <b>Survey</b> Company RAE was raised {{as part of the}} 2nd Australian Imperial Force for service overseas and a <b>Survey</b> staff was appointed to the formation (Corps) headquarters. In September 1940 significant expansion of the Australian <b>Survey</b> Corps was approved by Cabinet to include a <b>Survey</b> Directorate on Army Headquarters (AHQ) and higher formation headquarters, an AHQ <b>Survey</b> Company, an AHQ Cartographic Company, regional command field <b>survey</b> companies, a <b>Survey</b> Section 7th Military District (Darwin) and a Corps <b>Survey</b> Mobile Reproduction Section.
