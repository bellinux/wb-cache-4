Achieving stagnation temperatures exceeding 200 [*]°C, pertinent to these technologies, with unconcentrated sunlight requires spectrally selective absorbers with exceptionally low emissivity in the thermal wavelength range and high visible absorptivity for the solar spectrum. In this Communication, we report a semiconductor-based multilayer selective absorber that exploits the sharp drop in optical absorption at the bandgap energy to achieve a measured absorptance of 76 % at solar wavelengths and a low emittance of approximately 5 % at thermal wavelengths.

40|$|Abstract — Solar-thermal power {{generation}} {{is based on}} the transformation of solar radiation into heat andusing that heat in a thermo-mechanical process. The solar radiation is concentrated by meansof mirrors to achieve a higher energy density in the focus of the mirrors and therefore be ableto force higher temperatures on a heat transfer medium. There are several geometrical optionsfor the realization of the concentrators. The efficient utilization of solar energy for heating, cooling and other applications utilizes flat-plate collector or concentrator systems, which first capture as much as possible of the incoming solar radiation and then deliver a high fraction of the captured energy through a working fluid.

30|$|Solar {{power is}} the most {{abundant}} and intensive source of renewable energy. The global installation of solar-related energy conversion systems keeps increasing rapidly in recent years [1]. There are many ways of utilizing this energy, including photovoltaic, solar-biologics, and photoelectrochemical cells and the harvest of <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> energy. Among these, <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> systems are simple, efficient, and cost-effective. <b>Solar</b> <b>thermal</b> energy devices include Rankine cycle engines [2], solar dryers [3], solar thermoelectric generators [4], <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> reformers [5, 6], and solar water heaters [7]. Nanomaterials, furthermore, have many unique physical properties that make them very attractive and useful in the conversion and utilization of solar energy [8, 9]. Most of the research efforts up to date have been focused on photovoltaics and photocatalysis [10 – 16], {{and only a few}} nanomaterials have been applied in <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> energy <b>conversion</b> systems [4, 17 – 19]. In addition, silicon nanowire has been reported as a promising functional nanomaterial in transistors [20], sensors [21], batteries [22, 23], thermoelectrics [24], photocatalysis [25], piezoelectrics [26], photoelectrochemical cells (PEC) [27], and photovoltaics [14, 28, 29] owing to its preferable optical, thermal, chemical, and mechanical properties in energy conversion systems as well as the fact that silicon nanowire arrays are easy to synthesize [30 – 32]. Micro/nanoscale-textured silicon surface had been recognized as a potential material for <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> energy harvesting [33]. However, despite the well-known feature of the “black silicon” for silicon nanowires [34, 35], there is still a scarcity of reported experimental studies on silicon nanowires for <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> energy systems, especially on the spectral-dependent radiative properties and the corresponding <b>solar</b> to <b>thermal</b> energy <b>conversion</b> efficiency. In addition, although silicon nanowire array absorbs visible light more effectively, the trade-off effects of scattering properties at different wavelengths in the vis-near IR range of silicon nanowires have not been clearly investigated and reported. Solar irradiation in the IR range, however, poses a significant fraction of the <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> energy that can be utilized in practice. Therefore, in this study, we carried out experimental and theoretical analyses on the <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> radiation of the silicon nanowire array radiative properties. Also, to demonstrate its potential application for <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> systems where a selective solar spectrum would be required, we conducted solar drying experiments which involved the infrared heating of a moist porous material. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the enhancement of <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> energy harvest by silicon nanowire structures where the spectral optical properties including light absorption and scattering vary in the main wavelength range of solar irradiation. The intrinsic optical properties of the thin silicon plates (with or without silicon nanowires) used in these experiments block most ultraviolet and visible light while allowing a significant fraction of infrared to be transmitted, which is assumed to be absorbed directly by the moist porous material below. Based on our literature review, the investigation specifically on the trade-off spectral-dependent <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> behavior has not been clearly reported in scientific articles. Therefore, it is emphasized that the results of this study can be used to evaluate the overall solar energy conversion efficiency of silicon nanowire-based hybrid energy conversion systems such as photovoltaic and <b>solar</b> <b>thermal</b> systems.|$|R
