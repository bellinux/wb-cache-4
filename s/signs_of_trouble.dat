5|$|When the {{legislature}} {{met for the}} first time after the 1909 election, things seemed to be going well for Rutherford and his government. He controlled a huge majority, albeit slightly reduced from the 1905 election, and enjoyed widespread popularity. His government had achieved significant success in setting up a new province, and this success looked poised to continue. Early in this new legislative session, however, two <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> appeared: Liberal backbencher John R. Boyle began to ask questions about the agreement between the government and the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company, and Cushing resigned from cabinet over his views of this same agreement.|$|E
25|$|<b>Signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> {{were present}} {{even before the}} disappointing crowds {{filtered}} into their seats, as it was very apparent the team was cutting costs left and right. Not only was the pre-game video presentation done away with, but the board itself was not even turned on for the game. Advertising on the boards and field were {{for the most part}} bare, and the uniforms themselves clearly looked to be done on the cheap.|$|E
25|$|Behind {{the title}} races, however, there were <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> brewing in Formula One. Long-established, highly {{respected}} names like Brabham and Lotus {{vanished from the}} starting grids. French manufacturer Ligier found themselves in desperate straits, and were sold to Alain Prost. Ken Tyrrell's team foundered on, despite dismal results, until 1998, when BAR bought the team. And the colourful era of the small, private teams finally came to an end. Names like Larrousse, Dallara, Simtek, Pacific, MasterCard Lola, Life Racing Engines, March Engineering, Onyx Grand Prix, Coloni, Andrea Moda, Fondmetal, Osella, Footwork, AGS, Lambo, Leyton House Racing, EuroBrun and Forti {{would no longer be}} seen on the starting grids, with only Jordan, Sauber, Arrows and Minardi managing to survive somehow. The flourishing of Jordan in 1998 and 1999, under the leadership of Damon Hill, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher (Michael's younger brother) proved to be a last hurrah of the privateer, not a sign of health in the sport. Even once mighty Benetton, champions only a few years before, were barely surviving. Jackie Stewart fronted his own team from 1997 to 1999 with backing from Ford but even then sold out as the team transformed into Jaguar.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Poyser's good-natured face showed <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>troubled</b> astonishment. [...] "Not find her? What's {{happened}} to her?" [...] he said, his thoughts flying {{at once to}} bodily accident.|$|R
50|$|GTI {{reported}} a strong revenue growth of 134% {{in the year}} to $234.4 million but, in the first <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> ahead, profits increased a meager 23% to $22.6 million.|$|R
50|$|On August 10, {{the first}} <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> was at 6:53 p.m., when double train 43 {{completed}} the climb to Boulevard Barbès station with heavy smoke pouring {{from one of}} the motors on its front car, car M202.|$|R
500|$|Bounty sailed from Cape Town on 1 July, reached Tasmania on 19 August, {{and arrived}} at Matavai Bay, Tahiti, on 26 October. The latter stages of this voyage, however, saw <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> between Bligh and his {{officers}} and crew; rows and disagreements grew steadily more frequent. On arrival, Heywood and Christian were assigned to a shore camp which would act as a nursery for the breadfruit plants. They would live here throughout the Tahiti sojourn, a [...] "situation of comfort and privilege" [...] which, according to historian Richard Hough, was much envied by those required to spend their nights on the ship. Whether crew were ashore or on board, however, duties during Bounty's five months' stay in Tahiti were relatively light. Some men took regular partners from the native women, while others led promiscuous lives; both Christian and Heywood are listed among the officers and men treated for venereal infections.|$|E
500|$|In Australia, while Jardine's unfriendly {{approach}} and superior manner caused some friction {{with the press}} and spectators, the early tour matches were uncontroversial and Larwood and Voce had a light workload {{in preparation for the}} Test series. The first <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> came in the match against a representative [...] "Australian XI" [...] at near full strength, in which the bowlers first used Bodyline tactics. Under the captaincy of Bob Wyatt (Jardine having rested from the match), the England attack bowled short and around leg stump, with fielders positioned close by on the leg side to catch any deflections. Wyatt later claimed this was not pre-planned and he simply informed Jardine what had happened. The Bodyline tactics continued in the next match and several players, including Jack Fingleton, were hit. The Australian press were shocked and criticised the hostility of Larwood in particular. Some former Australian players joined the criticism, saying the tactics were ethically wrong. However, at this stage, not everyone was opposed, and the Australian Board of Control believed the English team had bowled fairly. On the other hand, Jardine increasingly came into disagreement with tour manager Warner over Bodyline as the tour progressed. Warner hated Bodyline but would not speak out against it. He was accused of hypocrisy for not taking a stand on either side, particularly after expressing sentiments {{at the start of the}} tour that cricket [...] "has become a synonym for all that is true and honest. To say 'that is not cricket' implies something underhand, something not in keeping with the best ideals...all who love it as players, as officials or spectators must be careful lest anything they do should do it harm." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Glasgow Herald reported, [...] "...her friends noted her {{as someone}} who fled at <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble,</b> who walked out of jobs if she clashed with a colleague, and who moved from one flat to the next all over London. She didn't answer the phone to her sister and didn't appear to have her own circle of friends, instead relying on the company of {{relative}} strangers who came with the package of a new boyfriend, a colleague, or flatmate." ...|$|E
6000|$|Daisy {{stopped and}} looked at him, without a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>troubled</b> {{consciousness}} in her face, with nothing but the presence of her charming eyes and her happy dimples. [...] "Well, she's a cool one!" [...] thought the young man.|$|R
50|$|It was {{the closest}} Democrats had come to retaking the seat since Glickman's 1994 loss, and though clearly the Republican won, analysts {{described}} the unusually close race as a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> for Republicans in the Fourth District, and in Kansas, and nationally.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I shan't," [...] I {{answered}} reassuringly; [...] "we {{are getting}} {{near the border}} now, and no <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble.</b> And besides," [...] I added, [...] "I think Miss Thorn tried to frighten me. And she very nearly succeeded. It was prettily done." ...|$|R
2500|$|In summer 312, {{the first}} real <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> of Liu Cong's reign came, as he {{executed}} a prince in charge of river matters and a duke in charge of construction on trivial matters—the prince for failing to supply his court with sufficient fish and crabs, and the duke for failing to complete two palaces on time. [...] When the general Wang Zhang (王彰) tried {{to persuade him to}} control his behavior, he became enraged and wanted Wang killed, but imprisoned Wang after Wang's daughter, a concubine of his, interceded. [...] Later, he regretted his actions and released and promoted Wang, but this incident started a pattern of impulsive actions, often with cruelty, that would plague the rest of Liu Cong's reign.|$|E
2500|$|Sometime in August 1947, {{the first}} <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> {{broke out in}} Poonch, about which {{diverging}} views have been received. Poonch was originally an internal jagir (autonomous principality), governed by an alternative family line of Maharaja Hari Singh. The taxation {{is said to have}} been heavy. The Muslims of Poonch had long campaigned for the principality to be absorbed into the Punjab province of British India. In 1938, a notable disturbance occurred for religious reasons, but a settlement was reached. During the Second World War, over 60,000 men from Poonch and Mirpur districts enrolled in the British Indian Army. After the war, they were discharged with arms, which is said to have alarmed the Maharaja. In June, Poonchis launched a 'No Tax' campaign. In July, the Maharaja ordered that all the soldiers in the region be disarmed. The absence of employment prospects coupled with high taxation drove the Poonchis to rebellion. The [...] "gathering head of steam", states scholar Srinath Raghavan, was utilised by the local Muslim Conference led by Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim Khan (Sardar Ibrahim) to further their campaign for accession to Pakistan.|$|E
2500|$|The 1960s {{is often}} cited as being {{the golden age of}} Pakistani cinema. Many stars were {{introduced}} during this period who would go on to become cinema legends on the silver screen. As black-and-white became obsolete, Pakistan saw the introduction of first colour films. Some that share the status of being firsts are Munshi Dil's Azra in the early 1960s, Zahir Raihan's Sangam (first full-length coloured film) released on 23 April 1964, and Mala (first coloured cinema scope film). In 1962 Shaheed was released which introduced the Palestine conflict to Pakistanis in cinemas and became an instant hit. In 1962, Pakistan's most versatile actor Mohammad Ali debuted in Charagh Jalta Raha. It was premiered by Fatima Jinnah on 9 March 1962 at Nishat Cinema in Karachi. In September 1965, following the war between Pakistan and India, all Indian films were completely banned. A light ban had existed since 1952 in West Pakistan and since 1962 in East Pakistan, but was exercised rigorously after the War of 1965. Pakistani cinemas did not suffer much from the decision to remove the films and instead received better attendances. Realising the potential, Waheed Murad stepped into the industry. His persona led people to call him the [...] "chocolate hero" [...] and in essence, he became the Marlon Brando and Elvis Presley of Pakistan. In 1966, Armaan was released and {{became one of the most}} cherished Urdu films to ever release. The film is said to have given birth to Pakistani pop music, by introducing playback singing legends like composer Sohail Rana and singer Ahmed Rushdi. The film became the first to complete a 75-week screening at cinemas throughout the country attaining a platinum jubilee status. Another rising star during this period was Nadeem Baig, who received instant stardom with his debut film Chakori in 1967. The same year, he would act in another film of a different genre. Horror films were introduced with the release of Zinda Laash, making it the first Pakistani film to display an R rating tag on its posters. Meanwhile, Eastern Films Magazine, a tabloid edited by Said Haroon, became the most popular magazine for film buffs in Pakistan. The magazine had a question and answer section titled [...] "Yours Impishly" [...] which the sub-editor Asif Noorani took inspiration for from I. S. Johar's page in India's Filmfare magazine. Tabloids like these got their first controversial covers with the release of Neela Parbat on 3 January 1969, which became Pakistan's first feature-film with an adults-only tag. It ran for only three-to-four days at the box office. More controversial yet would be the offering of distribution rights in the Middle East to the Palestinian guerrilla organisation, Al Fatah, by the writer, producer, and director Riaz Shahid for his film Zarqa released on 17 October 1969. It depicted the activities of the organisation. Towards the late 1960s and early 1970s, political turmoil once again returned with the East Pakistan conflict brewing. Amidst concerns, the film Dosti, released on 7 February 1971 and turned out to be the first indigenous Urdu film to complete 101weeks of success at the box office, dubbing it the first recipient of a Diamond Jubilee. As political uncertainty took charge of the entertainment industry, filmmakers were asked to consider sociopolitical impacts of their films as evident by the fact that the makers of Tehzeeb, released on 20 November 1971, were asked to change the lyrics with a reference to Misr, Urdu for Egypt, that might prove detrimental to diplomatic relations of Egypt and Pakistan. So vulnerable was the film industry to the changing political landscape that in 1976, an angry mob set fire to cinema in Quetta just before the release of the first Balochi film, Hamalo Mah Gunj. Javed Jabbar's Beyond the Last Mountain, released on 2 December 1976, was Pakistan's first venture into English film-making. The Urdu version Musafir did not do well at the box office. <b>Signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> slowly began in the cinema industry as VCRs and piracy became an issue.|$|E
50|$|The South Carolina Republican Party {{held their}} primary on June 9, 1998 {{and it was}} a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> that Governor David Beasley faced {{opposition}} to his reelection within his own party.

60|$|I did {{not sleep}} well during {{what was left}} of the night, for my mind went {{traveling}} backward and forward through the ages. The next morning, at breakfast, Mr. Crowder appeared in his ordinary good spirits, but his wife was very quiet. She was pale, and occasionally I thought I saw <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> on her usually placid brow. I felt sure that he had told her his story. As I looked at her, I could not prevent myself from seriously wondering that a man who had seen Abraham and Sarah, and had been personally acquainted with the Queen of Sheba, should now be married to a Quaker lady from North Sixteenth street, Philadelphia. After breakfast she found an opportunity of speaking to me privately.|$|E

6000|$|... "No; {{we found}} {{everything}} {{going on as}} usual. It has been decided to put the courthouse {{as far as we}} can in a state of defense. I shall have the spare ammunition quietly taken over there, with stores of provisions. The ladies have undertaken to sew up sacking and make gunny bags for holding earth, and, of course, we shall get a store of water there. Everything will be done quietly at present, and things will be sent in there after dark by such servants as we can thoroughly rely upon. At the first <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> the residents will make straight for that point. Of course we must be guided by circumstances. If the trouble begins in the daytime--that is, if it does begin, for the native officers assure us that we can trust implicitly in the loyalty of the men--there will probably be time for everyone to gain the courthouse; if it is at night, and without warning, as it was at Meerut, I can only say, Doctor, may God help us all, for I fear that few, if any, of us would get there alive. Certainly not enough to make any efficient defense." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well we {{have been}} married now for a year, and very happy {{we have been}}. But about a month ago, {{at the end of}} June, I saw for the first time <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble.</b> One day my wife {{received}} a letter from America. I saw the American stamp. She turned deadly white, read the letter, and threw it into the fire. She made no allusion to it afterwards, and I made none, for a promise is a promise, but she has never known an easy hour from that moment. There is always a look of fear upon her face--a look as if she were waiting and expecting. She would do better to trust me. She would find that I was her best friend. But until she speaks, I can say nothing. Mind you, she is a truthful woman, Mr. Holmes, and whatever trouble there may have been in her past life it has been no fault of hers. I am only a simple Norfolk squire, but there is not a man in England who ranks his family honour more highly than I do. She knows it well, and she knew it well before she married me. She would never bring any stain upon it--of that I am sure.|$|E
