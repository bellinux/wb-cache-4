It is not compulsory, but everyone who has had their compulsory education {{has the right to}} upper secondary education. The typical course length is four years, for students aged between 16 and 20. The length of the course can vary, especially in vocational courses. This stage of education is governed by the Upper Secondary <b>School</b> <b>Act</b> of 2007. Like all other schools in Iceland, upper secondary schools are mixed sex.|$|E
5|$|Politically {{the city}} was {{dominated}} by the Republican Party, which had developed a strong political machine. The Republicans dominated the post-war elections, and corrupt officials {{made their way into}} the government and continued to control the city through voter fraud and intimidation. The Gas Trust was the hub of the city’s political machine. The trust controlled the gas company supplying lighting to the city. With the board under complete control by Republicans in 1865, they awarded contracts and perks for themselves and their cronies. Some government reform did occur during this time. The police department was reorganized; and volunteer fire companies were eliminated and were replaced by a paid fire department. A compulsory <b>school</b> <b>act</b> passed in 1895, and the Public School Reorganization Act freed the city's education from the political machine. Higher education changed as well. The University of Pennsylvania moved to West Philadelphia and reorganized to its modern form; and Temple University, Drexel University and the Free Library were founded.|$|E
5|$|The school {{eventually}} outgrew {{its original}} site. While many public schools {{moved away from}} Greater London in the late Nineteenth Century, a joint decision {{was made by the}} school's management and the school committee to stay in the capital as it was deemed a stimulating environment for education by many. By a further Act of Parliament, the City of London <b>School</b> <b>Act</b> 1879, it was empowered to move to a new site at Blackfriars on the Victoria Embankment overlooking the Thames (still in the City of London). The school moved in 1883 and the new building was opened by the Prince of Wales, (the future King Edward VII).|$|E

2500|$|Justice Fisher then {{referred}} {{briefly to}} the Common <b>Schools</b> <b>Act.</b> He {{concluded that it}} was {{essentially the same as}} the Parish <b>Schools</b> <b>Act,</b> with the only real difference that school assessment became mandatory. [...] He also noted that the Common <b>Schools</b> <b>Act</b> did not provide directly for bible readings, but left the decision as to Bible readings to the Board of Education, which could enact a regulation on that issue. [...] He stated that whether or not the Board enacted such a regulation did not affect the constitutionality of the Act as a whole. [...] As a result, he concluded that the Common <b>Schools</b> <b>Act</b> was constitutional.|$|R

25|$|Tupper's {{position}} on the Manitoba <b>Schools</b> <b>Act</b> was that French Catholics in Manitoba had been promised the right to separate state-funded French-language Catholic schools in the Manitoba Act of 1870.

This stage of education is governed by the Upper Secondary <b>School</b> <b>Act</b> of 1996. All schools in Iceland are mixed sex schools. The largest seat of higher education is the University of Iceland, which has its main campus in central Reykjavík. Other schools offering university-level instruction include Reykjavík University, University of Akureyri, Agricultural University of Iceland and Bifröst University.|$|E
25|$|In 1916 under Premier T.C. Norris {{the prior}} {{compromise}} was rescinded and the Franco-Manitoban minority lost {{their right to}} receive instruction in French in Manitoba's public schools. Section 93 of the BNA act(1867) in the Province's opinion had been contravened with the Laurier-Greenway Compromise and no longer had legal standing. Moreover, in section 93 of the BNA the province had ultimate authority to decide on minority language instruction. The latter remained status-quo until two changes were made to Manitoba's Public <b>School</b> <b>Act</b> (PSA) in 1966 and 1970 when French language instruction was once again recognized as an official language of instruction.|$|E
25|$|By 1871, several Canadian provinces {{had already}} {{implemented}} provincially run public schooling systems, {{and others were}} considering it. In Ontario, Egerton Ryerson had fought for secularization {{as a means of}} keeping power {{out of the hands of}} any church, and from 1844 as Chief Superintendent of Education for Upper Canada, he had instituted significant reforms l, leading to the creation of a strong state-run education system. In Nova Scotia, Premier Charles Tupper had successfully introduced public schooling through his Free <b>School</b> <b>Act</b> of 1864. Lemuel Allan Wilmot, a former New Brunswick Attorney-General and in 1871, its lieutenant governor, had been an outspoken advocate for the creation of a unified taxation-funded public school system in New Brunswick for many years.|$|E
50|$|The {{main issue}} in the {{election}} was the Common <b>Schools</b> <b>Act</b> passed in 1871.

25|$|The {{history of}} {{education}} in this region, North West Territories, began officially in 1885 with Territorial Ordinance #5. North West Territorial Schools Districts or One Room School Houses replaced trading post schooling, missionary schools and private schooling of the past. Moose Jaw School District #1 was formally established December 5, 1884 under the new Board of Education. The 1944 <b>School</b> <b>Act</b> set out to establish larger consolidated schools {{and the formation of}} the schools and school districts presently in use. As with any Canadian province, the Saskatchewan Legislature has almost exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905, the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated before 1905, as well as to create and/or regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling). For historians and genealogists, previous school district records have been submitted to the Saskatchewan Provincial Archives Regina Branch.|$|E
500|$|In 1927, Perren Baker, Brownlee's Minister of Education, had {{announced}} as his priorities {{improving the quality}} of teaching and ensuring that sufficient schools existed for the growing number of students wishing to earn a high school diploma. [...] In pursuit of these objectives, he released a new <b>School</b> <b>Act</b> in 1929, whose major initiative was to consolidate Alberta's thousands of autonomous school districts, each with control over its own finances, into a smaller number of school divisions. [...] The act also moved responsibility for teacher salaries and employment conditions from the school districts to the provincial government and standardized educational mill rates across the province. [...] Educational reformers supported the legislation as a vehicle for coherent reform of the sort that was impossible under the decentralized status quo, but a large majority of rural residents, the staple of the UFA's support base, opposed it for fear that it would lead to the closure of local schools and greater travel distances for rural students. [...] While Brownlee strongly supported the bill, he ordered it withdrawn in deference to public opinion.|$|E
