5|$|The {{descriptor}} hydrated or anhydrous is {{used when}} referring to iron(III) chloride, {{to distinguish between the}} two common forms. The hexahydrate is usually given as the simplified empirical formula FeCl3⋅6H2O.

5|$|The toothed whales (<b>systematic</b> <b>name</b> Odontoceti) form a parvorder of the cetaceans. As {{the name}} suggests, the parvorder is {{characterized}} by having teeth (rather than baleen).

40|$|Abstract: The {{availability}} of <b>systematic</b> <b>names</b> can enable the simple textual exchange of chemical structure information. The exchange of molecular structures in graphical format or connection tables has become well {{established in the}} field of cheminformatics and many structure drawing tools exist to enable this exchange. However, even with the {{availability of}} <b>systematic</b> <b>naming</b> rules, software tools to allow the generation of names from structures, and hopefully the reversal of these <b>systematic</b> <b>names</b> back to the original chemical structure, have been sorely lacking in capability and quality. Here we review the need for <b>systematic</b> <b>naming</b> {{as well as some of}} the tools and approaches being taken today in this area...|$|R
5|$|Baleen whales (<b>systematic</b> <b>name</b> Mysticeti), known earlier as {{whalebone}} whales, form a parvorder of the infraorder Cetacea (whales, dolphins and porpoises). They are {{a widely}} distributed and diverse parvorder of carnivorous marine mammals. Mysticeti comprise the families Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale). There are currently 15 species of baleen whale. While cetaceans were historically {{thought to have}} descended from mesonychids, molecular evidence supports them as relatives of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla). Baleen whales split from toothed whales (Odontoceti) around 34 million years ago.|$|E

25|$|The <b>systematic</b> <b>name</b> of pyridine, {{within the}} Hantzsch–Widman {{nomenclature}} {{recommended by the}} IUPAC, is azine. However, systematic names for simple compounds are used very rarely; instead, heterocyclic nomenclature follows historically established common names. IUPAC discourages the use of azine in favor of pyridine. The numbering of the ring atoms in pyridine starts at the nitrogen (see infobox). An allocation of positions by letter of the Greek alphabet (α-γ) and the substitution pattern nomenclature common for homoaromatic systems (ortho, meta, para) are used sometimes. Here α (ortho), β (meta), and γ (para) refer to the 2, 3, and 4 position, respectively. The <b>systematic</b> <b>name</b> for the pyridine derivatives is pyridinyl, wherein {{the position of the}} substituted atom is preceded by a number. However, here again the historical name pyridyl is encouraged by the IUPAC and used instead of the <b>systematic</b> <b>name.</b> The cationic derivative formed by the addition of an electrophile to the nitrogen atom is called pyridinium.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{names of}} {{elements}} are trivial, some originating in alchemy. IUPAC has accepted these names, but has also defined systematic names of elements {{that have not}} yet been prepared. It has adopted a procedure by which the scientists who are credited with preparing an element can propose a new name. Once the IUPAC has accepted such a (trivial) name, it replaces the <b>systematic</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{appropriate}} contexts, ozone can {{be viewed}} as trioxidane with two hydrogen atoms removed, and as such, trioxidanylidene may be used as a context-specific <b>systematic</b> <b>name,</b> according to substitutive nomenclature.

25|$|Barrelene is a bicyclic organic {{compound}} with chemical formula C8H8 and <b>systematic</b> <b>name</b> bicycloocta-2,5,7-triene. First synthesized and described by H. E. Zimmerman in 1960 the name {{derives from the}} obvious resemblance to a barrel, with the staves being three ethylene units attached to two methine groups. It is the formal Diels-Alder adduct of benzene and acetylene. Due to its unusual molecular geometry the compound is of considerable interest to theoretical chemists.|$|E
25|$|Lactose, a {{disaccharide}} {{composed of}} one D-galactose molecule and one D-glucose molecule, occurs naturally in mammalian milk.

Other notable disaccharides include maltose (two D-glucoses linked α-1,4) and cellulobiose (two D-glucoses linked β-1,4). Disaccharides {{can be classified}} into two types: reducing and non-reducing disaccharides. If the functional group is present in bonding with another sugar unit, it is called a reducing disaccharide or biose.|$|E

Seventy-three species of toothed whales (also called odontocetes) are described. They are one of two living groups of cetaceans, the other being the baleen whales (Mysticeti), which have baleen instead of teeth. The two groups {{are thought to have}} diverged around 34 million years ago (mya).|$|E
25|$|Acetaldehyde (<b>systematic</b> <b>name</b> ethanal) is {{an organic}} {{chemical}} compound with the formula CH3CHO, sometimes abbreviated by chemists as MeCHO (Me = methyl). It {{is one of}} the most important aldehydes, occurring widely in nature and being produced on a large scale in industry. Acetaldehyde occurs naturally in coffee, bread, and ripe fruit, and is produced by plants. It is also produced by the partial oxidation of ethanol by the liver enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase and may be a contributing factor to hangovers from alcohol consumption. Pathways of exposure include air, water, land, or groundwater, as well as drink and smoke. Consumption of disulfiram inhibits acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of acetaldehyde, thereby causing it to build up in the body.|$|E
25|$|An eight-period table {{containing}} {{this block}} was suggested by Glenn T. Seaborg in 1969. IUPAC defines an element to exist if its lifetime {{is longer than}} 10−14 seconds, which is {{the time it takes}} for the nucleus to form an electron cloud. No elements in this region have been synthesized or discovered in nature. The first element of the g-block may have atomic number 121, and thus would have the <b>systematic</b> <b>name</b> unbiunium. Elements in this region are likely to be highly unstable with respect to radioactive decay, and have extremely short half lives, although element 126 is hypothesized to be within an island of stability that is resistant to fission but not to alpha decay. It is not clear how many elements beyond the expected island of stability are physically possible, whether period 8 is complete, or if there is a period 9.|$|E
