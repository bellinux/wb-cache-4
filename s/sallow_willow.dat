50|$|The {{entirety}} of the loch {{has been an}} SSSI since 1983 and the island's perimeter and the neighbouring islet to the south west have woodland cover including the species of Rowan, Aspen, Downy Birch, Grey Willow and <b>Sallow</b> <b>Willow.</b> The underlying geology is Lewisian Gneiss overlain by peaty podzols and gleys.|$|E
5000|$|The New River Company was {{incorporated}} by Royal charter in 1619 with Sir Hugh Myddleton as first governor. Under the charter, {{it was a}} penal offence to throw rubbish or carrion into the river while anyone washing clothes in it or planting <b>sallow,</b> <b>willow</b> or elm trees within five yards of it would incur the [...] "King's displeasure". The company became a significant landowner in the Clerkenwell district of Islington and laid out streets and squares which take their name from people and places associated with the company, including Amwell Street, River Street, Mylne Street, Chadwell Street and Myddelton Square.|$|E
50|$|This {{species can}} be found in most of Europe, {{northern}} Africa, and western Asia. It is an extreme rarity in Britain, although it used to be widespread throughout England and Wales. Most of the specimens seen in Britain are thought to be captive-bred releases. These butterflies mainly inhabit woodland, especially with <b>sallows</b> (<b>willows).</b>|$|R
50|$|The species feed on alder, ash, blackthorn, elder, hawthorn, pine, <b>sallow,</b> and <b>willow.</b> They also feed on fruits such as apple, horse chestnut, and plum.|$|R
5000|$|The larvae feed {{on various}} <b>sallows</b> and <b>willows,</b> mainly Salix repens, {{on which the}} larva spins {{together}} the leaves of a terminal shoot and feeds within.|$|R
50|$|The young {{caterpillars}} {{feed on the}} catkins of <b>sallow</b> and <b>willow</b> (Salix), progressing {{to eating}} leaves when mature. They hide in spun leaves by day and feed at night.|$|R
50|$|The species members feed on alder, apple trees, currant, sloe, <b>sallow,</b> and <b>willows.</b> Adults feed on Aphididae, Carabidae, and Psyllidae. In some cases, {{they also}} feed on plants of pear trees, causing the pears to have stoney pits, among other damages.|$|R
5000|$|Salle ( [...] ) is {{a village}} and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. It is around 10 mi north-west of Norwich in Broadland district. The village, which is {{pronounced}} Saul, gets {{its name from}} [...] "Sallow Wood", <b>Sallow</b> referring to <b>Willow</b> in Norfolk.|$|R
50|$|Wildlife in {{the nature}} reserve {{includes}} kingfisher, mute swans, watervoles, damselfly and dragonfly species such as the white-faced darter, various species of duck, and even the rare bird of prey the hobby. Plants include cotton sedge, bog moss (Sphagnum), great hairy willowherb, bog myrtle, water figwort, flag iris, cross-leaved heath, bog rosemary, cranberry and sundew; common alder trees, alder buckthorn, grey <b>sallow</b> and crack <b>willow</b> predominate.|$|R
5000|$|The Saughall part of {{the name}} has been {{recorded}} as deriving from salh and halh, meaning [...] "Hall where <b>sallows</b> or <b>willow</b> shrubs grew" [...] or [...] "Willow nook".The name de Massie, de Massey or de Mascy has been connected to the Wirral {{since the time of}} the Norman Conquest. Baron Hamon de Mascey, whose family came from the settlement of Mascey near Avranches, Normandy, established Birkenhead Priory in 1150. His relations, the Masseys of Sale, settled on the Wirral during the reign of King John were supposed to have given their name to the village.Over the years the name has been spelt as: Saligh (1249); Salghale (1309); Salgham (1385); Saughoughe (1546).|$|R
5000|$|One {{cure for}} {{headache}} was to bind a stalk of crosswort {{to the head}} with a red kerchief. Chilblains were treated with a mix of eggs, wine, and fennel root. Agrimony was cited as a cure for male impotence - when boiled in milk, it could excite a man who was [...] "insufficiently virile;" [...] when boiled in Welsh beer it would have the opposite effect. The remedy for shingles comprised a potion using the bark of 15 trees: aspen, apple, maple, elder, <b>willow,</b> <b>sallow,</b> myrtle, wych-elm, oak, blackthorn, birch, olive, dogwood, ash, and quickbeam.|$|R
40|$|THESIS 10794 The genus Salix L. (<b>willows,</b> <b>sallows</b> and osiers) of the Salicaceae {{consists}} of dioecious, catkin-bearing trees, shrubs or undershrubs with simple, nearly always alternate leaves. Willows {{are used as}} biofuel and biomass crops, {{but there is a}} lack of information on their genetic variability. This information will be crucial to further development of future commercial clones. This project aimed to investigate genetic diversity in a set of willow species and in populations of Salix caprea L. (goat willow) and Salix viminalis L. (osier). In particular, neutral markers (nuclear and chloroplast microsatellites) and also sequences from several gene fragments involved in wood formation or disease resistance were used...|$|R
60|$|In {{this time}} I found much employment, (and very {{suitable}} {{also to the}} time) for I found great occasion of many things which I {{had no way to}} furnish myself with, but by hard labour and constant application; particularly, I tried many ways to make myself a basket; but all the twigs I could get for the purpose proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was a boy I used to take great delight in standing at a basket-maker's in the town where my father lived, to see them make their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very officious to help, and a great observer of the manner how they worked those things, and sometimes lent an hand, I had by this means so full knowledge of the methods of it, that I wanted nothing but the materials; when it came into my mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew, might possibly be as tough as the <b>sallows,</b> and <b>willows,</b> and osiers, in England; and I resolved to try.|$|R
60|$|The rainy seasons held {{sometimes}} {{longer and}} sometimes shorter, as the winds happened to blow; {{but this was}} the general observation I made. After I had found, by experience, the ill consequences of being abroad in the rain, I took care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I might not be obliged to go out: and I sat within doors as much as possible during the wet months. In this time I found much employment, and very suitable also to the time; for I found great occasion for many things which I had no way to furnish myself with, but by hard labour and constant application: particularly, I tried many ways to make myself a basket: but all the twigs I could get for the purpose proved so brittle, that they would do nothing. It proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was a boy, I used to take great delight in standing at a basketmaker's in the town where my father lived, to see them make their wicker-ware; and being, as boys usually are, very officious to help, and a great observer of the manner how they worked those things, and sometimes lending a hand, I had by these means full knowledge of the methods of it, so that I wanted nothing but the materials; when it came into my mind, that the twigs of that tree from whence I cut my stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the <b>sallows,</b> <b>willows,</b> and osiers, in England; and I resolved to try. Accordingly, the next day, I went to my country house, as I called it; and cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as I could desire: whereupon I came the next time prepared with a hatchet to cut down a quantity, which I soon found, for there was great plenty of them. These I set up to dry within my circle or hedge; and when they were fit for use, I carried them to my cave: and here, during the next season, I employed myself in making, as well as I could, several baskets; both to carry earth, or to carry or lay up any thing as I had occasion for. Though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose: and thus, afterwards, I took care never to be without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed, I made more; especially strong deep baskets, to place my corn in, instead of sacks, when I should come to have any quantity of it.|$|R
