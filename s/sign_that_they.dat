5|$|In May 1098, Kerbogha of Mosul {{approached}} Antioch {{to relieve}} the siege. Bohemond bribed an Armenian guard named Firouz to surrender his tower, and in June the crusaders entered the city and killed most of the inhabitants. However, {{only a few days}} later the Muslims arrived, laying siege to the former besiegers. According to Raymond D'Aguilers, it was at this point that a monk named Peter Bartholomew claimed to have discovered the Holy Lance in the city, and although some were skeptical, this was seen as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be victorious.|$|E
5|$|They {{prohibited}} mass gatherings in {{an attempt}} to stop entire villages or other large groups of people from emigrating together, and also isolated people who sold their water buffalo and other belongings, as this was a clear <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> intended to end their farming. Both the Americans and the South Vietnamese lodged complaints to the International Control Commission about the violations of the Geneva Accords, but little action was taken. According to B. S. M. Murti, the Indian representative on the ICC, the communists did not try to stop the refugees at first, but increased their efforts over time as it became clearer that large proportions of the population wanted to emigrate.|$|E
5|$|The Jin were {{weakened}} by {{the pressure of the}} rising Mongols to the north, a series of floods culminating in a Yellow River flood in 1194 that devastated Hebei and Shandong in northern China, and the droughts and swarming locusts that plagued the south near the Huai. The Song were informed of the Jurchen predicament by their ambassadors, who traveled twice a year to the Jin capital, and started provoking their northern neighbor. The hostilities were instigated by chancellor Han Tuozhou. The Song Emperor Ningzong (r. 1194–1224) took little interest in the war effort. Under Han Tuozhou's supervision, preparations for the war proceeded gradually and cautiously. The court venerated the irredentist hero Yue Fei and Han orchestrated the publishing of historical records that justified war with the Jin. From 1204 onwards, Song armed groups raided Jin settlements. Han Tuozhou was designated the head of national security in 1205. The Song funded insurgents in the north that professed loyalist sympathies. These early clashes continued to escalate, partly abetted by revanchist Song officials, and war against the Jin was officially declared on June 14, 1206. The document that announced the war claimed the Jin lost the Mandate of Heaven, a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were unfit to rule, and called for an insurrection of Han Chinese against the Jin state.|$|E

50|$|During the Inquisition in Spain, bodies {{undergoing}} {{preparation for}} burial were sometimes scrutinized for <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had been washed, {{since this was}} seen as a marker of secret Jewish practice (crypto-Judaism).|$|R

25|$|To the north, {{the acropolis}} holds two {{quarters}} of the city (one west and the other east of the main north-south street), rebuilt by Hermocrates after 409BC. The houses are modest, built with recycled material. Some of them contain incised crosses, a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were later adapted as Christian buildings or inhabited by Christians.|$|E
50|$|The {{appearance}} of high-quality counterfeit $100 banknotes in 2001 from Windsor to Montreal resulted in about 10% of retailers to post <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{would refuse to}} accept $100banknotes in a cash transaction.|$|R
60|$|Of Audrey and Ogden {{there were}} no <b>signs.</b> <b>That</b> <b>they</b> were out somewhere in the grounds this mellow spring morning I took for granted; but I could not make an {{extended}} search. Already I had come nearer to the house than was prudent.|$|R

25|$|In early 2012, the infighting {{between the}} Rojos and the Metros that left bloody {{confrontations}} and high-ranking arrests has diminished. Nonetheless, the Gulf Cartel {{had to change}} its logistics and reconstruct how it manages regional bosses, while other sources say that the Rojos are no longer part of the cartel. In the end, the control fell to the cartel members of the Metros faction, although the Rojos still has significant manpower. The Rojos and the forces loyal to the Cardenas drug family have barricaded in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, while their leader Juan Mejía González has fallen off the radar {{and has not been}} heard off since then. A day after several members of the Metros put up banners commemorating the late Samuel Flores Borrego on 6 August 2012, gunfighting occurred in the city, and the Metros' push in Matamoros is a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are determined to remove people who turned against the organization in the past.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{in early}} 1948, the Arab forces had severed the supply line to Jewish Jerusalem. On 31 March, Dov Yosef {{introduced}} a draconian system of food rationing. The bread ration was 200grams per person. The April Passover week ration per person was 2lb potatoes, 2 eggs, 0.5lb fish, 4lb matzoth, 1.5oz dried fruit, 0.5lb meat and 0.5lb matza flour. The meat cost one Palestine pound per pound. On 12 May, water rationing was introduced. The ration was two gallons/person/day, of which four pints was drinking water. In June the weekly ration per person was 100 grams of wheat, 100 g beans, 40 g cheese, 100 g coffee or 100 g powdered milk, 160 g bread per day, 50 g margarine {{with one or}} two eggs for the sick. The mallow plant {{played an important role in}} Jerusalem history at this time. When convoys bearing foodstuffs could not reach the city, the residents of Jerusalem went out to the fields to pick mallow leaves, which are rich in iron and vitamins. The Jerusalem radio station, Kol Hamagen, broadcast instructions for cooking mallow. When the broadcasts were picked up in Jordan, they sparked victory celebrations. Radio Amman announced that the fact that the Jews were eating leaves, which was food for donkeys and cattle, was a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were dying of starvation and would soon surrender.|$|E
500|$|The coroner and the 15 {{jurors were}} local gentlemen and yeomen of substance.

50|$|Mexico's {{inhabitants}} {{were mostly}} {{unaware of the}} methods Durazo's detectives used to keep crime under control until the bodies of 12 Colombians, alleged to be bank robbers, {{were found in the}} Tula River with <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had been tortured and executed, questions began to be asked.|$|R
50|$|There is also {{evidence}} that the victim is aware that something is not quite right, even though they can't pinpoint it. Persons suffering from the attack may vocalize <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> 'they just lost their memory', or <b>that</b> <b>they</b> believed they had a stroke, although they aren't aware of the other <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are displaying.

500|$|... "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] was {{met with}} {{critical}} praise and helped to re-energize Yankovic's career. Cobain considered the parody as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had [...] "made it" [...] as a band. The song is one of Yankovic's most successful singles, reaching number 35 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the US Mainstream Rock Tracks. The song's video {{was nominated for a}} 1992 MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video.|$|E
500|$|Whereas {{the group}} were {{known for their}} earnest live act in the 1980s, their Zoo TV {{performances}} were intentionally ironic and self-deprecating; on stage, Bono portrayed several characters he conceived, including [...] "The Fly", [...] "Mirror Ball Man", and [...] "MacPhisto". The majority of the album's songs were played at each show, and the set lists began with up to eight consecutive Achtung Baby songs as a further <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were no longer the U2 of the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|Orson Welles {{created a}} {{film version of}} the play in 1948, {{sometimes}} called the Übermensch Macbeth, which altered the witches' roles by having them create a voodoo doll of Macbeth in the first scene. Critics take this as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> control his actions completely throughout the film. Their voices are heard, but their faces are never seen, and they carry forked staves as dark parallels to the Celtic cross. Welles' voiceover in the prologue calls them [...] "agents of chaos, priests of hell and magic". At {{the end of the}} film, when their work with Macbeth is finished, they cut off the head of his voodoo doll.|$|E
50|$|By late 2004 the band's {{constant}} {{media coverage}} {{had started to}} lead to a general public backlash, and Hawkins and the band themselves seemed to show <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were disillusioned with their constant media appearances, infamously walking off of an episode of the U.S.-nationally-syndicated radio talk show Loveline on 19 April 2004.|$|R

500|$|There {{were two}} kinds of Jurchen shamanistic rituals, {{corresponding}} to {{two kinds of}} shamans. The most common was [...] "domestic ritual": ritual-based sacrifices to Heaven and to the clan's ancestors conducted by hereditary shamans from that clan. [...] "Primitive ritual," [...] on the other hand, was performed by people who had undergone a [...] "shamanic illness," [...] which {{was seen as a}} <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had been chosen by the spirits. Entering into a trance, these [...] "transformational" [...] shamans let themselves be possessed by various animal spirits and sought the help of these spirits for purposes like healing or exorcism. These shamans set up an altar in their own houses and received a different kind of training from hereditary shamans.|$|E
500|$|St Hill's batting {{success was}} {{significant}} for many in cricket. Writer Grant Farred observed: [...] "In St Hill the masses that watched the game... saw a vision created in which anger and resentment at the 'pervading humiliation' they suffered was distilled into a finely tuned batsman." [...] At the time, black Trinidadians had no democratic outlet for their feelings and opinions. Fared writes that St Hill's batting [...] "represented a victory over the forces that held sway over this community's life in all other walks of life". St Hill's many followers in Trinidad identified with his successes {{and his ability to}} compete with equality on the cricket field as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> successfully take part in other aspects of life which had been closed to them.|$|E
500|$|The Spiegel article accuses von Bülow of {{accepting}} without due scrutiny any fragment or urban legend that fits his suspicions of foul play, and describes {{him as a}} [...] "dreamer". However, {{in his analysis of}} von Bülow's book and the response to it in Germany, Stefan Theil has contended that Der Spiegel is, itself, not unknown to publish speculative or conspiratorial theories, and suggests that the surprisingly strenuous article had deeper motivations than high feelings over journalistic quality. He speculates that the fact that Germans who claimed to believe that George W. Bush masterminded 9/11 were not actually demonstrating in the streets was a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> simply regarded the conspiracy theorist literature as [...] "political entertainment". With American difficulties in Iraq intensifying, and the possibility of Europe becoming dragged in, politicians and journalists alike were being forced to turn away from the escapism the plots offered.|$|E
50|$|Yoichi, {{like his}} parents, is clairvoyant {{and seems to}} each have {{a certain amount of}} ESP.

500|$|The concert {{began with}} a fixed {{sequence}} of six to eight consecutive Achtung Baby songs, a further <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were no longer the U2 of the 1980s. For the opening song, [...] "Zoo Station", Bono entered as his primary stage persona, [...] "The Fly", appearing silhouetted against a giant screen of blue and white video noise interwoven with glimpses of xerox animations of the band members. [...] "The Fly" [...] was usually performed next, with the video monitors flashing a rapidly changing array of textual words and aphorisms. Some of these included [...] "Taste is the enemy of art", [...] "Religion is a club", [...] "Ignorance is bliss", [...] "Watch more TV", [...] "Believe" [...] with letters fading out to leave [...] "lie", and [...] "Everything you know is wrong". (During {{the first week of}} the tour, media outlets incorrectly reported that the words shown included [...] "Bomb Japan Now", forcing the band to issue a statement denying the claim.) Before [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing", Bono channel surfed through live television programming, and during the song, as random images from television and pop culture flashed on screen, he filmed himself and the band with a camcorder.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} later, {{hundreds}} of people participated in a protest and march organized by UVA faculty as [...] "part {{of a series of}} responses to the recently published Rolling Stone article". A student quoted in The Daily Progress said that men at a nearby bar were [...] "quick to yell 'insults and slurs' at the protestors as they walked by". A local business owner expressed support of non-violent demonstrations and told The Cavalier Daily that [...] "The only way thing change is if you talk about what's happening." [...] The march ended outside of the Phi Kappa Psi house where protesters challenged a perceived [...] "culture of sexual assault at the University". Community members offered suggestions for immediate steps administration could take to implement preventative measures and address safety concerns regarding sexual assault. One student protestor told The Cavalier Daily: [...] "I really hope the University takes this article and the protest movement as a <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> need to be more transparent about the way they deal with sexual assault." [...] Four participants who were sitting on the steps to the Phi Kappa Psi house were arrested on trespassing charges for refusing to move when police officers asked them to leave.|$|E
500|$|For these concerts, Bache {{programmed}} five of Liszt's symphonic poems, the Faust and Dante symphonies, the Thirteenth Psalm and the Legend of St. Elisabeth. Works of Berlioz, Schumann and Wagner {{were also}} featured, but Liszt's compositions predominated. While {{the performances of}} the Faust and Dante symphonies were British premieres, the symphonic poems had previously been introduced at the Crystal Palace; nevertheless, Bache felt that offering repeat performances of the symphonic poems was important in making them familiar to audiences. Les préludes was performed three times at the Bache concerts, Mazeppa, [...] Festklänge and Orpheus each twice and Tasso once. Part of this strategy of familiarity was {{the inclusion of the}} two-piano arrangements of the symphonic poems as a way to prepare audiences for the orchestral versions. Bache had begun this practice with his first concert in 1865, when he and Dannreuther presented the two-piano arrangement of Les préludes. Another part of this strategy was supplying learned, well-considered and thoroughly detailed essays for program notes. Sometimes Bache wrote them himself; at other times, he relied on prominent theorists such as Carl Weitman and Frederick Niecks. According to musicologist Alan Walker, they [...] "are filled with insights that were both new and original for their time, and they are lavishly illustrated with music examples—a sure <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were aimed at a sophisticated public and were intended to have a potential life after the concert was over." [...] According to Walker, they still are worth study for Liszt scholars as many of the ideas, while transmitted through members of Liszt's inner circle, probably originated with the composer himself. These notes, along with the inclusion of the two-piano arrangements and what musicologist Michael Allis calls [...] "a thoughtful approach to programming ... all contributed to an aggressive marketing of Liszt's new status as a composer".|$|E
50|$|The Cumbrian numbers, {{often called}} 'sheep {{counting}} numerals' {{because of their}} (declining) use by shepherds to this very day, show clear <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may well have their origins in Cumbric.

50|$|British {{anthropologist}} Tudor Parfitt, {{who specializes}} in Jewish studies, believes the Ark of the Covenant was kept in the town for some time before it was taken across to Africa, where the Israelites leaving Sena settled along the Limpopo River in Zimbabwe.
