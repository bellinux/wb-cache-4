5|$|A {{collaboration}} between the Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency {{has resulted in the}} construction of a rock ramp, to allow migrating sea trout to pass up the river beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of rock, with 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer, were used to create the ramp. The finer material ensures that water mainly flows over the ramp, rather than through it. The ramp also enables young eels or elvers to move up the river, and provides habitat for <b>stone</b> <b>loach</b> and bullheads.|$|E
25|$|No {{complete}} and precise {{list of all}} the fish in the Irrawaddy river basin currently exists, but in 1996 it was estimated that there are about 200 species. In 2008, it was estimated that the Irrawaddy ecoregion is home to 119â€“195 species of fish found nowhere else in the world (endemic). Several new species of fish have been described from the Irrawaddy river basin in recent years (for example, the cyprinid Danio htamanthinus in 2016 and the <b>stone</b> <b>loach</b> Malihkaia aligera in 2017), and it is likely that undescribed species remain.|$|E
500|$|Atlantic salmon, {{brown trout}} and sea trout use {{the river to}} spawn. Other fish species found include Three-spined stickleback, minnow, <b>stone</b> <b>loach,</b> [...] and eel. Dippers and Grey wagtails {{can also be seen}} feeding on insects along the river. Invertebrate species found include leeches, Simulidae and Ancylidae. Various Mayfly {{families}} are found, such as; Baetidae, Ephemerellidae, Heptageniidae and Caenidae. Stoneflies (Nemouridae, Chloroperlidae and Perlodidae families) and caddis larvae (Hydropsychidae, Polycentropidae, Rhyacophilidae and Limnephilidae families) are also present.|$|E

500|$|Flows in {{the river}} are swelled by {{discharges}} from several sewage treatment works. The three largest are at Princes Marsh, Petersfield and Ambersham, {{all of which have}} outflows between [...] per day, with another three discharging between [...] per day at Rogate, Coultershaw and Fittleworth. The entire river, including parts of some of its tributaries, is designated as a Site of Nature Conservation Importance by the local authorities through which it flows, in recognition of its value for wildlife. The upper reaches of the Rother are important for their fish populations of brown trout, grayling, juvenile sea trout, and the spawning and early development of salmonids. There are also populations of bullhead, eel, lamprey, minnow and <b>stone</b> <b>loach.</b> There has been some concern about declining fish stocks, thought to be partly caused by soil erosion, leading to silt and sediments being deposited on the river bed, which has been exacerbated by low flows {{in the river}}. Parts of the lower river support the same types of fish, but there are areas, particularly immediately upstream of weirs, where the major species are bream, pike and roach, with chubb, dace and perch on the lowest reaches. In order to assist the movement of fish along the river, particularly those that migrate to the headwaters to spawn, fish passes have been constructed around the gauging stations. The only known population of native white clawed crayfish in Sussex is located in {{the upper reaches of the}} Rother.|$|E
2500|$|Being underground, {{many places}} where {{cavefish}} may live {{have not been}} thoroughly surveyed. New cavefish species are described with some regularity and undescribed species are known. As a consequence, the number of known cavefish species has risen rapidly in recent decades. In the early 1990s only about 50 species were known, in 2010 about 170 species were known, and by 2015 this had surpassed 200 species. It {{has been estimated that}} the final number might be around 250 obligate cavefish species. For example, the first cavefish in Europe, a Barbatula <b>stone</b> <b>loach,</b> was only discovered in 2015 in Southern Germany. Conversely, their unusual appearance means that some cavefish already attracted attention in ancient times. The oldest known description of an obligate cavefish, involving Sinocyclocheilus hyalinus, [...] is almost 500 years old.|$|E
