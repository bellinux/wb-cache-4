50|$|The main {{route from}} Mossel Bay to the Langkloof passed through Blanco, where a {{settlement}} of merchants was soon established. The village was also the main <b>postal</b> <b>centre.</b> This caused dissatisfaction among the businessmen of George, and so a direct link from George to the toll-house was built in about 1882. This road was called Bain's Trace and was probably built by Thomas Bain, who surveyed the new route.|$|R

It was curated by Saskia Bos, who adopted the theme of [...] "connectedness, contribution and commitment" [...] and sought to reject commercially oriented art while fostering engagement with the public in order to [...] "exhibit a utopian sociability in art". Works were again exhibited at the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art and the <b>postal</b> <b>centre</b> in Oranienburger Straße as well as under the elevated S-Bahn at Jannowitzbrücke and the Allianz Building, known as the Treptowers.|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} Noble Park as a suburb in Melbourne began in 1909. Allan Buckley nicknamed the land {{subdivision}} Nobel Park after the Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. Buckley {{had used the}} estate to demonstrate Nobel's explosives but the name was soon transformed to Noble Park by common usage. Early settlement was encouraged by building a community <b>centre,</b> church, school, <b>postal</b> <b>centre</b> and later, a railway station. The <b>postal</b> <b>centre</b> was opened in August 1910 and the railway station was completed in July 1912. In the early days, growth was relatively slow {{due to the lack}} of population growth in the area. In the early 1920s, the Railway Department set up a poultry farm and eventually a plant nursery was set up in the eastern part of the suburb. The focus of the small community was based around its local town hall. In the 1980s Noble Park became known for its infamous gangs that carried out violent crimes against the community as well as the scene of a major shoot out between members of the Victorian Police and Pavel Marinof, a burglar on the run. Residential growth in the second half of the century saw an end to the grazing paddocks and market gardens. By the 1990s, 56% of Noble Park’s population was born overseas, with the largest being from Great Britain and Ireland), followed by Bosnians, Italians and Greeks); and South and South East Asians (including Indians, Sri Lankans and Vietnamese), according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In recent years there has been an upsurge of migrants and refugees settled from North African countries, especially Sudan.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{delivery}} districts is a continuous task of postaltechnology because migration of population, construction ofbuildings and traffic routes etc. change {{the quantity and}} stJuctureof postal items thus significantly influencing the delivery effeet. In solving the problem of designing the delive 1 y areas ofpublic postal operator the key values are the quantity of postalitems, length of delivery route and load (effect) of the can·ier. Delivery district borders have to be adequately determined andthey should be relatively uniform {{in order to achieve}} rationalizationand to balance the load on the can·ier. To gather thedata about the <b>postal</b> <b>centre</b> area, a model of AHP method applicationhas been set, in which the optimal solution of organizingdelive 1 y areas is selected by means of the multi-criteria analysisof alternative solutions...|$|R
50|$|The first {{exhibition}} {{ran from}} 30 September to 30 December 1998 and was curated by Klaus Biesenbach, Hans-Ulrich Obrist and Nancy Spector. It {{took place in}} the Kunst-Werke Institute for Contemporary Art in Berlin-Mitte, at the Akademie der Künste in Pariser Platz and at the <b>postal</b> <b>centre</b> in Oranienburger Straße. More than 70 artists took part, including several unknowns who would later become famous, such as Franz Ackermann, Jonathan Meese, Thomas Demand and Olafur Eliasson. The show was interdisciplinary to reflect the context of contemporary art. During the opening week, the Thai artist Rirkrit Tiravanija catered a banquet for 1,000 guests in the post office gymnasium, and a three-night combination symposium and festival, Congress 3000, {{took place in the}} House of World Cultures.|$|R

30|$|Besides machine vision, {{depending}} on the specific system requirements and {{the complexity of the}} task, alternative sensing modalities may be adopted. We mention X-ray sensors, although they are not appropriate to address the specific problem we are considering, since they acquire the interior of an object. X-rays are used in a different but related application which is luggage security control in airports. Here, it is worth observing {{that the majority of the}} analysis is performed manually, by human operators. SAFEPOST considered the use of X-rays as a way to inspect automatically the parcel looking for dangerous goods. There is a limited but promising literature of methods addressing object recognition in X-ray images [1, 8, 22], but the main limitation is the considerable cost of the machine and the significant amount of space it occupies which is not always available in the postal feeding lines. For this reason, in the SAFEPOST logic, X-ray scanning is considered as a complementary feature which may be optionally installed on a <b>postal</b> <b>centre,</b> should it be requested by the postal operator.|$|R

5000|$|The {{centre of}} the {{worldwide}} Army Postal Services operation was the Home Postal Depot (HPD) RE, first established in London {{in the late summer}} of 1939, but was moved to GPO Reading shortly after the outbreak of war. It was then relocated to GPO premises in Bournemouth to be nearer to the Continent and therefore provide a more efficient service to the troops of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) serving in France and Belgium. Correspondence addressed to [...] "APO England" [...] and to Army and RAF units serving overseas tended at the GPO was circulated to the HPD RE. The Depot, whose primary responsibility was to collect, sort and despatch military mail to its final destination, also acted as a recruitment, training and reinforcement depot, as well as, a Records Office for the RE (PS) and a supply <b>centre</b> for <b>Postal</b> units worldwide.In May 1941 the Depot was redesignated the Home <b>Postal</b> <b>Centre</b> RE (HPC RE) and relocated to Nottingham, where the organisation requisitioned, for operational and billeting purposes, a hundred and forty of the city's buildings, including; the Vyvella factory premises, the Hickings buildings, the GPO's Queen Street offices and Trent Bridge Cricket ground.
