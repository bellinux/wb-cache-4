By employing three different multiplexing ar- chitectures in the network, DTDM permits graceful evolution of the existing circuit switching network into a flexible broadband packet communication network supporting integrated voice, data, and video traffic. The first multiplexing stage uses a packet assembler to multiplex different broadband services into a common DTDM-format serial bit stream. The second multiplexing stage uses a statistical packet mul- tiplexer to concentrate network traffic for more efficient use of trans- mission facilities.

40|$|Multiplexing {{is a way}} of {{accommodating}} many input {{sources of}} a low capacity over a high capacity outgoing channel. Statistical Time Division Multiplexing (STDM) is a technique that allows the number of users to be multiplexed over the channel more than the channel can afford. The STDM normally exploits unused time slots by the non-active users and allocates those slots for the active users. Therefore STDM is appropriate for bursty sources.

40|$|Keywords: B-ISDN, congestion, ATM, <b>statistical</b> <b>multiplexer,</b> cell-loss. Cell loss {{is often}} assumed to occur at random. However, when an ATM cell {{is lost because}} of buffer {{overflow}} at a <b>statistical</b> <b>multiplexer,</b> there is an altered probability that the cells following it will be lost. In this report, conditional probabilities of cell-loss due to congestion are modelled mathematically, and then simulations used to verify the models are described. Conditional probabilities are modelled and simulated using M/M/ 1 /K, MID/ 1 /K, M/D/ 1 /K with minimum interarrival times and SPP/D/ 1 /K queues. Results from the models and simulations show that cell loss exhibits 'bursty' behaviour. If one cell is lost, the probability of following cells being lost is substantially higher than the overall cell loss probability. Consequently, cell loss has to be characterised by {{more than just an}} average rate. The average and variance of the number of cells lost are proposed as additional statistics to characterise cell loss caused by buffer overflow. In this paper these statistics are calculated and tabulated for M/M/ 1 /K and M/D/ 1 /K multiplexer models. Some of the repercussions of the bursty nature of cell loss for Broadband services are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} two rather separate issues: network reliability and traffic analysis. The first concerns the reliability for unreliable systems, including communications networks with possible link failures, and more general fault-tolerant systems. The second concerns the traffic characteristics specifically in ATM networks {{with respect to}} the performance of statistical multiplexers. One way in which we studied the reliability issue is via mean time to failure (MTTF) which considers systems that have component failures and repairs with exponential distributions. Such systems can be modeled by continuous-time discrete- state Markov chains. We investigated the MTTF from a more general framework of fault-tolerant systems (FTS), and developed two systematic approaches, the allpath-weight approach and the signal-flow-graph approach, to compute the MTTF. We also derived a simple asymptotic formula for estimating the MTTF, and obtained asymptotically the optimal networks in terms of the MTTF. The other way in which we studied the reliability issue is via reliability polynomials for a system with component failures with certain fixed probability that is independent of time, but a function {{of the size of the}} system. No repair is allowed. We modeled such systems by random graphs, and analyzed reliability polynomials in a framework of random graph theory. We specifically focused on certain regular random graphs and analyzed the evolution of the regular random graphs, by showing a transition phenomenon when such a regular random graph evolves from edge probability zero to probability one because of the expansion of graph size, and identified its threshold function. Our work extends the study of the evolution of random graphs to regular random graphs which do not appear in the literature of random graphs, and our results are generalizations of some famous previously known results in random graph theory. As for the second issue of traffic analysis in ATM networks, we first studied, via the approach of generating functions, Markov on-off traffic and the performance behavior of a <b>statistical</b> <b>multiplexer</b> with such traffic. We developed a heuristic procedure which allowed us to compute the expected buffer occupancy of a <b>statistical</b> <b>multiplexer</b> with Markov on-off traffic, and obtained closed form formulas showing that the expected buffer occupancy under such traffic not only depends on the incoming traffic intensity, but also largely on the burstiness of incoming traffic. The expected buffer occupancy becomes unbounded with large enough traffic burstiness, even though the traffic intensity is small. These results showed that burstiness control of traffic was very critical in designing ATM networks. We then introduced a class of burst-constrained traffic sources, the periodic interchangeable (PI) traffic, and applied generalized Ballot theorems to analyze the buffer occupancy in a <b>statistical</b> <b>multiplexer</b> with PI traffic. We derived closed form formulas for survivor functions, expected buffer occupancy, and simple asymptotic formula that can be used as a rule of thumb for dimensioning buffer size in designing a <b>statistical</b> <b>multiplexer.</b> The results obtained could shed light on the study of worst case performance of statistical multiplexers for burst-constrained traffic sources in ATM networks...|$|E
