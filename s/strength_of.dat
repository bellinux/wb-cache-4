5|$|All {{military}} {{aircraft in the}} DRC are operated by the Air Force. Jane's World Air Forces states that the Air Force has an estimated <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> 1,800 personnel and is organised into two Air Groups. These Groups command five wings and nine squadrons, of which not all are operational. 1 Air Group is located at Kinshasa and consists of Liaison Wing, Training Wing and Logistical Wing and has a <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> five squadrons. 2 Tactical Air Group is located at Kaminia and consists of Pursuit and Attack Wing and Tactical Transport Wing and has a <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> four squadrons. Foreign private military companies have reportedly been contracted to provide the DRC's aerial reconnaissance capability using small propeller aircraft fitted with sophisticated equipment.

5|$|Australian Army {{involvement}} in UNTAG was formalised in February 1979 by Cabinet, which approved {{the plan to}} commit the 17th Construction Squadron, Royal Australian Engineers and Workshop as the main force for deployment. The squadron was to be supplemented by a Field Troop and by members posted from other units throughout the Army, bringing the squadron to a deployment <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> 275. A headquarters was to be formed, supporting the Chief Engineer at the UNTAG Military Headquarters. The total <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> the force was to be over 300 of all ranks, in what was known as Plan Witan.

40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that bond <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> filling materials to radicular dentin might be optimized by using an indirect dentin bonding procedure with an acrylic core material. Roots of human teeth were endodontically prepared and obturated with EndoREZ, Epiphany, or the bonding of an acrylic point with SE Bond by using a direct or an indirect bonding technique. Bond <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> endodontic sealers to radicular dentin were measured with a thin slice push-out test. Push-out <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> EndoREZ and Epiphany to radicular dentin were less than 5 megapascals (MPa). The direct bonding technique with acrylic points and the self-etching adhesive had push-out <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> 10 MPa, increasing to 18 MPa with the indirect technique. The use of the indirect bonding protocol with an acrylic point to compensate for polymerization stresses {{appears to be a}} viable means for optimizing bond <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> endodontic filling materials to radicular dentin...|$|R
