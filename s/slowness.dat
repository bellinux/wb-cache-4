40|$|We have {{quantified}} {{the errors}} associated with VTI parameter estimation using multi-offset VSP data. Two common methods, P-wave <b>slownesses</b> only and slowness-polarization are investigated. Estimation errors {{are expressed in}} terms of the magnitude of the earth anisotropy, uncertainties related to first break pickings and maximum available source offset. For homogeneous overburden, P-wave <b>slownesses</b> technique can be used to estimate VTI parameters. We demonstrate that estimation errors of using only P-wave <b>slownesses</b> are significantly decreased as longer source offsets are included in the inversion algorithm. Larger offsets involve P-waves which propagate near horizontal at the receiver level and enhance the method's efficiency. An example synthetic VSP is presented next where P-wave <b>slownesses</b> technique successfully recovers VTI model parameters. In case of heterogeneous overburden, P-wave slowness-polarization technique seems to be a solution as {{there is no need to}} compute P-wave horizontal <b>slownesses.</b> However, we demonstrate that the errors of VTI parameter estimation using this technique are small only where the anisotropy is very weak (below 5 %) and they are not improved by increasing the offset. Furthermore, wave interference effect on polarizations makes the method impractical even on noise free synthetic data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The spectral-analysis-of-surface-waves (SASW) {{method is}} a {{relatively}} new in situ method for determining shear-wave <b>slownesses.</b> All measurements are made on the ground surface, making it much less costly than methods that require boreholes. The SASW method uses a number of active sources (ranging from a commercial Vibroseis truck to a small handheld hammer for the study conducted here) and different receiver spacings to map a curve of apparent phase velocity versus frequency. With the simplifying assumption that the phase velocities correspond to fundamental mode surface waves, forward modeling yields an estimate of the subsurface shear-wave <b>slownesses.</b> To establish the reliability of this indirect technique, we conducted a blind evaluation of the SASW method. SASW testing was performed at 10 strong-motion stations at which borehole seismic measurements were previously or subsequently made; if previously made, the borehole results were not used for the interpretation of the SASW data, and vice-versa. Comparisons of the shear-wave <b>slownesses</b> from the SASW and borehole measurements are generally very good. The differences in predicted ground-motion amplifications are less than about 15 % for most frequencies. In addition, both methods gave the same NEHRP site classification for seven of the sites. For the other three sites the average velocities from the downhole measurements were only 5 – 13 m/sec larger than the velocity defining the class C/D boundary. This study demonstrates that in many situations the SASW method can provide subsurface information suitable for site response predictions...|$|R

The combination of these two wells enables angular sampling in the vertical direction and over a range of inclination angles from 54 ° to 90 °. Dipole sonic logs from these wells show that the formation's average properties are, to a very good approximation, explained by a transversely isotropic medium with a vertical symmetry axis and with elastic parameters satisfying C[subscript 13]=C[subscript 12], but inconsistent with the additional ANNIE relation (C[subscript 13]=C[subscript 33]− 2 C[subscript 55]). More importantly, these data clearly show that, at least for fast anisotropic formations such as this gas shale, sonic logs measure group <b>slownesses</b> for propagation with the group angle equal to the borehole inclination angle. Conversely, the data are inconsistent with an interpretation that they measure phase <b>slownesses</b> for propagation with the phase angle equal to the borehole inclination angle...|$|R

A physiotherapist can help to reduce spasticity and avoid the development of contractures with techniques such as passive stretching. Nabiximols is safe and effective for relieving spacticity. There is evidence, albeit limited, of the clinical effectiveness of baclofen, dantrolene, diazepam, and tizanidine. In the most complicated cases intrathecal injections of baclofen can be used. There are also palliative measures like castings, splints or customized seatings.|$|E
30|$|Based on our {{developed}} {{understanding of}} the origin of the “swimming artifact”, we can now propose a mitigation technique. Since the artifact {{is due to the fact}} that the windows corresponding to different trial <b>slownesses</b> sample different amplitudes of the non-stationary signal envelope, we propose a certain choice of windowing to minimize the effect of the signal non-stationarity. We call this technique a “reference window” approach.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Observations of polarisations and <b>slownesses</b> at {{downhole}} receivers in walka-way or multioffset VSP experiments can {{in principle}} be inverted {{to give the}} anisotropic seismic velocity of the earth {{in the vicinity of}} the receiver array. In practice, such inver-sions have been only rarely reported, possibly due to a general lack of confidence in po-larisation measurements. We apply such an inversion to the direct P-wave arrivals from a 3 D VSP dataset acquired at the Oseberg field in the Norwegian North Sea. The large size of this dataset ensures that the result is more stable than those from comparable inversions applied to standard 2 D datasets. Comparison with the result from the more established, but more restricted, method of inversion of surface and receiver <b>slownesses</b> showed a large discrepancy. Further investigation revealed that this is due to acquisition-related co-herent noise on the estimated surface slownesses; there is no corresponding effect on the polarisation inversion because each shot is treated independently. We therefore prefer the result from the polarisation inversion in this case. ...|$|R

Diefenbaker hoped that US Vice President Richard Nixon would win the 1960 US presidential election, but when Nixon's Democratic rival, Senator John F.

5|$|Bradykinesia (<b>slowness</b> of movement) {{is found}} in every case of PD, and is due to {{disturbances}} in motor planning of movement initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation to execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is impaired. Bradykinesia is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinson’s disease leading to difficulties with everyday tasks such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities {{at the same time}} and can be made worse by emotional stress or concurrent illnesses. Paradoxically patients with Parkinson's disease can often ride a bicycle or climb stairs more easily than walk on a level. While most physicians may readily notice bradykinesia, formal assessment requires a patient to do repetitive movements with their fingers and feet.|$|E

30|$|We {{deployed}} a seismic array {{at a site}} 5 km east of Shinmoedake volcano, in the Kirishima volcanic {{complex of}} southwest Japan, {{five days after the}} sub-Plinian eruption on 26 January, 2011. The array record between February and September 2011 included explosion earthquakes and episodes of weak continuous tremor during eruption periods. We estimated <b>slownesses</b> and back azimuths of seismic waves on a sliding 1 -min window using the semblance method. The <b>slownesses</b> of the weak continuous tremor clustered within the range 0.2 – 0.8 s/km, consistent with a mix of body and surface waves. A probabilistic approach based on a grid search was used to estimate the source locations of the explosion earthquakes and weak continuous tremor. The sources of the explosion earthquakes were beneath the crater at depths of − 0.5 – 1 km above sea level, while the source of the weak continuous tremor was beneath the northern part of Shinmoedake at depths between 1 km below sea level and 1 km above sea level. This latter region corresponds to a shallow low-resistivity layer, suggesting that hydrothermal processes are more plausible than magmatic processes as the generating mechanism of the weak continuous tremor.|$|R

40|$|We {{identify}} a few unique {{issues that are}} important for performing a nonlinear refraction traveltime tomography effectively. These include accuracy of traveltime and raypath calculation for a turning ray and physical information in a refraction traveltime curve. Consequently, we develop a shortest path raytracing method with an optimized node distribution that can accurately calculate refraction traveltimes and raypaths in any velocity model. We find that minimizing misfit of refraction traveltimes with the least-squares criterion does not account for the whole physical meaning of a refraction traveltime curve. We therefore pose a different nonlinear inverse problem that explicitly minimizes misfits of both traveltimes (integrated <b>slownesses)</b> and traveltime gradients (apparent <b>slownesses).</b> As a result, we enhance the resolution of the tomographic inversion as well as the convergence speed. We regularize our inverse problem with the Tikhonov method as opposed to applying ad hoc smoothing to keep the inversion stable. The use of the Tikhonov regularization avoids solving an ill-posed problem and allows us to invert an infinite number of unknowns.

Approximately 200 paths have been studied. The results are presented for degrees and orders up to 6.

The filter reduces the amplitudes of regional variations, but does not change the overall pattern. The patterns of the regional variations are generally consistent with those obtained by regionalized inversion of great circle data (Paper I). The velocity maps show significant differences within oceans and continents. An analysis is made of correlations of surface wave velocities with heat flow and the non-hydrostatic geoid.
