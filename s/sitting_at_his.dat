He was first posted in the Maritimes in 1954, and stayed there for several years until heading to Paris, France to be a staff officer at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). He then {{returned to}} Canada to work at an RCAF station in Moisie, Quebec from 1965 through 1967, as the first fully bilingual RCAF officer. From there he served at the Canadian Armed Forces Headquarters in Ottawa from 1967 through 1971, during which time he was sent to assess the severity of Quebec's 1970 October Crisis. Following his 1971 retirement from the Armed Forces, he took up a position as an administrator at the University of Ottawa, eventually rising to the position of Housing Director. Brooks died on February 1, 1984 of a heart attack while <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> desk. Four years later, the university named one of the student residences in his honour.|$|E

The video features a clothed Michelle having her bare feet handled and commented on by an unseen camera operator with a voice similar to Rex's. The Jets released a press statement saying that Ryan and the organization considered the situation a private matter and would provide no comment. Multiple media reports soon linked the Ryans to a user profile named [...] "ihaveprettyfeet" [...] on a site for alternative sexual lifestyles, and more videos of Michelle emerged in the following months.

500|$|Around 1918, {{the leaders}} of the Italian Communists and Anarchists in the United States settled {{themselves}} in New Kensington. The group was guided by the ideas of Carlo Tresca, a union organizer for Industrial Workers of the World, [...] which were recorded first, in his newspaper La Plebe, or The Worker, and later in his anti-fascist paper, Il Martello (which translates to [...] "the hammer"). The Italian Communists and Anarchists harassed members of the Catholic Church. Italians who did go the church were made to feel inferior and many became too intimidated to go to church at all. At St. Peter's, one priest was shot through a window while he was <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> desk. Another priest was threatened that if he did not leave New Kensington he would be killed. In 1918, there were only thirteen families who attended Mass at St. Peter on Sunday. This continued for several years until Carlo Tresca moved from New Kensington to New York City in 1925.|$|E

500|$|It was revealed, {{a quarter}} century after the war, that Benjamin and Davis had agreed for the {{secretary}} to act as scapegoat rather than reveal the shortage of arms. Not knowing this, the Richmond Examiner accused Benjamin of [...] "stupid complacency". Diarist Mary Chestnut recorded, [...] "the mob calls him Mr. Davis's pet Jew". The Wise family never forgave Benjamin, {{to the detriment of}} his memory in Southern eyes. The general's son, Captain Jennings Wise, fell at Roanoke Island, and Henry's grandson John Wise, interviewed in 1936, told Meade that [...] "the fat Jew <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> desk" [...] was to blame. Another of the general's sons, also named John Wise, wrote a highly popular book about the South in the Civil War, The End of an Era (1899), in which he said that Benjamin [...] "had more brains and less heart than any other civic leader in the South... The Confederacy and its collapse were no more to Judah P. Benjamin than last year's birds nest." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward {{became ill}} during January 1553 with a fever and cough that {{gradually}} worsened. The imperial ambassador, Jean Scheyfve, reported that [...] "he suffers {{a good deal}} when the fever is upon him, especially from a difficulty in drawing his breath, {{which is due to}} the compression of the organs on the right side". Edward felt well enough in early April to take the air in the park at Westminster and to move to Greenwich, {{but by the end of}} the month he had weakened again. By 7 May he was [...] "much amended", and the royal doctors had no doubt of his recovery. A few days later the king was watching the ships on the Thames, <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> window. However, he relapsed, and on 11 June Scheyfve, who had an informant in the king's household, reported that [...] "the matter he ejects from his mouth is sometimes coloured a greenish yellow and black, sometimes pink, like the colour of blood". Now his doctors believed he was suffering from [...] "a suppurating tumour" [...] of the lung and admitted that Edward's life was beyond recovery. Soon, his legs became so swollen that he had to lie on his back, and he lost the strength to resist the disease. To his tutor John Cheke he whispered, [...] "I am glad to die".|$|E

Upset, he impulsively resigned on the spot. By then, however, he had already made {{a significant impact on}} Graham's.

2500|$|Blue Horse {{invariably}} dined with Burbank at {{noon and}} {{always had a}} good appetite. One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice that you always eat everything in front of you, but you never pass your plate back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? Is it because you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> table left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children. It is needless to say that all the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved and he walked home barefooted.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{legislation}} was still pending in Congress, on January 29, 1921, Senator Spencer wrote to Charles Moore, {{chairman of the}} Commission of Fine Arts, regarding the bill. [...] Moore replied on February 2, explaining his view that {{the best course of}} action would be to hire one of the few American sculptors capable of designing a coin, and then subject the result to the friendly criticism of other artists. [...] Spencer put James Montgomery, chairman of the Missouri Centennial Commission, in touch with Moore, and on February 9, Moore made several proposals for the design, including a [...] "prairie-schooner... second, the heads of [...] Boone and [...] Benton; third, the state seal of Missouri; and fourth, the Indian pointing westward". The hired sculptor could, Moore suggested, choose among these, as to which could be used to best effect, with Montgomery's approval and that of the Fine Arts Commission. Montgomery replied on February 16, proposing a [...] "standing figure of Daniel Boone, coon skin cap, deer skin clothes, with an Indian <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> feet, the Missouri River flowing in front, with the bluffs on opposite side, with one star with the figures [...] "24" [...] in center of star. This would signify first, that the white man had supplanted the Indian in Missouri Territory." [...] Montgomery also proposed that a star with the number [...] "24" [...] (Missouri being the 24th state) be included in the design, but be removed from the die after 5,000 coins were struck. [...] These would boost proceeds, helping to pay the sculptor's fee and the cost of the die, a total of $1,750. Montgomery wrote again on March 22, proposing that the words [...] "MISSOURI CENTENNIAL, SEDALIA, 1921" [...] appear on the coins, and if possible the centennial date of August 10 as well.|$|E

I need the rest and felt that it was imperative. You see there is no let up for me. It is a constant strain from morning till night." [...] Missionary colleague Miss Nellie Naomi Russell (born Ontonagon, Michigan, 31 March 1862; died 22 August 1911 in China) records: ...when he was weary in body and mind, there came like a thunderbolt the article by Mark Twain in the North American Review. I remember that day I went to his study on a matter of business, and found him <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> desk as if stricken at the heart. I exclaimed, [...] "What is it? Are you ill?" [...] "If I am what that man says, I am not fit for you to speak to me ! I feel as though I should go off and hide myself in a cave in the mountain, never again to be seen of man." [...] I thought he had gone out of his head with all his cares, and I replied, [...] " [...] What you need is rest and a doctor, and I am going to send for one." [...] If the writer of that article could have seen how he suffered he would have felt that every cent he received for that article would be a red hot coal of fire. A brave, masterful man he was, ever ready to relieve, not to add to the sum of human suffering, and while in some things he may have been unwise, his mistakes, whatever they may have been, were of the head and not the heart.|$|E
