25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve <b>spring</b> <b>compressor</b> is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve <b>spring</b> <b>compressor</b> above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E
50|$|Nicholas Sulentic (born 24 November 1887 in Croatia) immigrated from Croatia (then part of {{the former}} Austro-Hungarian Empire) to the United States in 1906, at age 15, living in Illinois and Wyoming before coming to Waterloo in 1916 to enter the grocery store {{business}} with his brother. Their business was located {{at the intersection of}} East Fourth and Adams Streets in a two-story brick building. He became president of North Waterloo Meat Co. and operated Pinkerton's grocery and bakery, the city's first supermarket, in 1921. He established a small factory on East Fourth Street but found the design of the valve <b>spring</b> <b>compressor</b> he had purchased was already protected by a patent. So, he invented his own device, a valve spring lifter, and combined it with a compressor. This device enabled garage mechanics to more easily gain access to parts within an engine. He founded Waterloo Valve <b>Spring</b> <b>Compressor</b> Co. in 1922. The company prospered and diversified from making tools to tool chests. The company was renamed Waterloo Industries in 1967 and became a successful tool storage manufacturer, with retail and industrial customers such as Sears (Craftsman brand), Lowe's, and Cornwell.|$|E

50|$|In 1946, Jacques Cousteau {{and another}} diver were almost killed while {{searching for the}} bottom of the <b>spring.</b> An air <b>compressor</b> used to fill their tanks had taken in its own exhaust fumes and {{produced}} carbon monoxide--nearly killing them before they could return to the surface from a depth of approximately 100 meters.|$|R
5000|$|The 1959 {{model year}} {{also saw the}} {{addition}} of an optional [...] "Air-Coil Ride" [...] air suspension system, utilizing air bags installed within the rear coil <b>springs.</b> An engine-driven <b>compressor,</b> reservoir, and ride-height control valve comprised {{the rest of the}} system, but as other automakers discovered, the troublesome nature of air-suspension outweighed its benefits. AMC discontinued the unpopular option {{at the end of the}} model year.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to {{continue}} {{the development of a}} temporary rail system for a robotic tank inspection device. The tanks to be inspected are in a hazardous environment that is dangerous to work in and navigate. A remotely controlled robot could reduce the need for manual labor in the tanks to initial setup, final removal, and touch ups. Similar setups have been created for inspecting tanks, but they are permanent installations and are meant only for inspections. The goal of the current phase of the project was to employ a new concept for supporting the rail system, create a working prototype, and analyze the effects of loads on the design. The rail system must be economical, quickly deployable, and safe. By modifying a <b>spring</b> <b>compressor,</b> a bracket was created that securely clamps to a tank service flange. From the bracket, a hanger was attached that allows PVC to be used as the rail for the inspection robot. This design is an improvement in terms of ease of installation and removal, practicality, and simplicity. Some issues to be resolved include decreasing flange-to-rail clearance, making the rail more rigid, and wiring the robot to the cart that traverses the rails. When the system is put to use, it will create better working conditions for many laborers. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|A second-generation, Stirling-cycle {{cryocooler}} (cryogenic refrigerator) {{for space}} applications, with a cooling capacity of 5 watts at 65 K, was recently completed. The refrigerator, called the Prototype Model, was designed {{with a goal}} of 5 year life with no degradation in cooling performance. The free displacer and free piston of the refrigerator are driven directly by moving-magnet linear motors with the moving elements supported by active magnetic bearings. The use of clearance seals {{and the absence of}} outgassing material in the working volume of the refrigerator enable long-life operation with no deterioration in performance. Fiber-optic sensors detect the radial position of the shafts and provide a control signal for the magnetic bearings. The frequency, phase, stroke, and offset of the compressor and expander are controlled by signals from precision linear position sensors (LVDTs). The vibration generated by the compressor and expander is cancelled by an active counter balance which also uses a moving-magnet linear motor and magnetic bearings. The driving signal for the counter balance is derived from the compressor and expander position sensors which have wide bandwidth for suppression of harmonic vibrations. The efficiency of the three active members, which operate in a resonant mode, is enhanced by a magnetic spring in the expander and by gas <b>springs</b> in the <b>compressor</b> and counterbalance. The cooling was achieved with a total motor input power of 139 watts. The magnetic-bearing stiffness was significantly increased from the first-generation cooler to accommodate shuttle launch vibrations...|$|R
