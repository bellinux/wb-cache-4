It consists in estimating {{the state of}} the vehicle from its inertial proprioceptions and sidescan extero-ceptions using a particle filter. The novelty is the use of sidescan acoustic perceptions and sidescan sonar maps instead of single-beam bottom-looking acoustic perceptions and bathymetric maps.

Major upturns in the index also tend to foreshadow cyclical peaks in the unemployment rate, which often occur well {{after the end of}} a recession. Another useful feature of the index that can be gleaned from the charts is its ability to signal sustained downturns in payroll employment. Whenever the year-over-year change in this index has turned negative by more than 15 points, the economy has entered into a recession. The most useful methods to predict business cycle use methods similar to the organization as Eurostat, OECD and Conference Board.|$|E

The survey consists of five questions on the following topics: i) current business conditions, ii) business conditions for the next six months, iii) current employment conditions, iv) employment conditions for the next six months, v) total family income for the next six months. Opinion on current conditions make up to 40% of the index and expectation about future as 60%, thus making it a [...] "Leading Indicator". After all surveys are collected, each question's positive responses are divided by the sum of its positive and negative responses. The resulting relative value is then used as an [...] "index value" [...] and compared against each respective monthly value for 1985. In that year, the result of the index was arbitrarily set at 100, representing it as index benchmark. That year was chosen as a benchmark year because it was neither a peak nor trough in the business cycle. The benchmark The index values for all five questions are averaged together to produce the CCI.

40|$|Abstract—As {{communication}} {{resources in}} VANETs are limited, {{they have to}} be used efficiently to achieve communication even under interference, especially in high load situations, where high packet loss is expected. Packet loss occurs on the channel or it occurs in the local queue due to a saturated channel. This article introduces a model that determines the network capacity and the influence of hidden stations. It presents a cross-layer framework for efficient channel usage motivated by this model. The framework comprises default mechanisms which efficiently avoid local congestion. We show how to integrate and combine advanced mechanisms at different layers.

40|$|Abstract—Large {{scientific}} parallel applications demand {{large amounts}} of memory space. Current parallel computing platforms schedule jobs without fully knowing their memory requirements. This leads to uneven memory allocation in which some nodes are overloaded. This, in turn, leads to disk paging, which is extremely expensive {{in the context of}} scientific parallel computing. To solve this problem, we propose a new peer-to-peer solution called Parallel Network RAM. This approach avoids the use of disk, better utilizes available RAM resources, and will allow larger problems to be solved while reducing the computational, communication, and synchronization overhead typically involved in parallel applications. We proposed several different Parallel Network RAM designs and evaluated the performance of each under different conditions. We discovered that different designs are appropriate in different <b>situations.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Parallel programs, peer-to-peer, cluster, network RAM, scheduling, simulation. ...|$|R

The vehicles are controlled autonomously and are subject to a rigid or semi-rigid formation policy. The individual controllers are assumed to have a limited range of forward and backward communication with other vehicles. Sufficient conditions are given that imply a lower bound on the maximum peak of the frequency response magnitude of the transfer function mapping a disturbance to the leading vehicle to a vehicle in the chain. This lower bound quantifies the effect of spacing separation policy, intervehicle communication policy, and vehicle settling response performance.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} issue of which filters {{should be used for}} feature point {{detection}}. Classical feature point detection meth-ods, e. g., SIFT, are based on the scale-space theory in which Gaussian filters are proven to be optimal under the scale-space axiom. However, the recent method SURF demonstrates em-pirically that a box filter can also achieve good performance even though it violates the scale-space axiom. This leads to the question: Is Gaussian filters necessary for feature point de-tection? Based on the analysis using filter bank and detection theory, we show that theoretically it is possible for a box fil-ter to perform better than the Gaussian filter. Additionally, we show that a new filter, pyramid filter, performs better than both box and Gaussian filters in some <b>situations.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms — feature point detection, SIFT, SUR...|$|R

The issues specifically considered are performance during a severe short-circuit and frequency stability after a sudden loss of generation. The results of the short-circuit simulation are then evaluated vis-à-vis the grid code requirements placed on wind generating plants. Using a large interconnected system encompassing several conventional synchronous generators, the effect of increased wind power generation on the frequency stability of the system after a loss of generation has been discussed.

40|$|Several {{countries}} have recently begun showing {{a good deal}} of interest in obtaining a broader perspective on prosperity and national development. This study is concerned with the background and history of the SCP life <b>situation</b> <b>index.</b>  SCP has used this index to track trends in the life situation of the Dutch population from 1974 to the present. Life situation is defined here as a combination of wellbeing and prosperity; it covers a wide range of key social domains: health, participation (volunteering, social isolation, socio-cultural leisure activities, sports), housing situation, ownership of consumer goods, mobility and holiday patterns. The objective of the index is to be policy-relevant, describe people's overall life situation and make improvements or deteriorations in life situation visible. The description of the life situation is placed in a broader framework of background information. This framework, which is based around the individual life situation, also includes determinants of life situation, environment and the use of public services. Within this broader framework the study also looks at a number of subjective indicators, {{based on the assumption that}} people's life situation affects their degree of happiness and satisfaction. The report gives a detailed description of what the SCP life <b>situation</b> <b>index</b> is, how it originated and how it has changed over time. In doing so, it looks among other things at the historical and international context and discusses the various choices that have to be made, such as the choice of domains and indicators (are the right domains and indicators included in the index?) and the way in which those domains and indicators are combined to form a single index. The report also considers the question of whether using such an index is actually helpful. Over the past 30 years the life situation of the Dutch population has improved. This improvement has occurred in all social groups, but not to the same extent across all groups.

The method is resolutioncomplete, {{in the sense that it}} always returns a path if one exists at a given resolution, or returns “failure ” otherwise. The path is computed by defining a new manifold that maintains a oneto-one correspondence with the singularity-free configuration space of the manipulator, and then using a higher-dimensional continuation technique to explore this manifold systematically from one configuration, until the second configuration is found.
