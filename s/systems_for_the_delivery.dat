Mannosylated and histidylated lipopolyplexes (Man(11) -LPR 100) were obtained by adding mannosylated and histidylated liposomes to mRNA-PEGylated histidylated polylysine polyplexes. Upon intravenous injection, ∼ 9 % of the radioactivity of technetium 99 m-labeled lipopolyplexes measured in the liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys {{was found in the}} spleen. We demonstrate that spleen from mice injected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) mRNA-loaded Man(11) -LPR 100 contained four times more DCs expressing EGFP than that from mice injected with sugar-free LPR 100. This better transfection of DCs is correlated with a better inhibition of B 16 F 10 melanoma growth and an increased survival time when mice were immunized with MART- 1 mRNA-loaded Man(11) -LPR 100.
