40|$|This paper {{describes}} the ultrastructure <b>of</b> the microcirculatory <b>vessels</b> in the mid- and lower dermis and subcutaneous fat.

Intracellular myofilamentous bundles associated with extracellular filaments were a characteristic feature of the endothelial cells in arterioles possessing an internal elastic lamina, but were only rarely seen in endothelial cells of venules. The ultrastructural features of these bundles and filaments suggested both contractile and anchoring functions. The elastic lamina of the arterioles was shown to be composed of individual elastic fibers oriented in the long axis <b>of</b> the blood <b>vessel</b> under the endothelium, rather than being a continuous sheet as in larger arteries and arterioles. The capillaries in the fat had wails of normal thickness (0. 1 – 0. 3 μm) similar to capillaries in other organs, {{in contrast to the}} dermal capillaries whose walls are 2 – 3 μm thick. The arterioles, capillaries, and venules in the fat were frequently devoid of veil cells in contrast to those in the derails. Venous capillaries with bridged fenestrations were found in close proximity to eccrine sweat glands and hair bulbs in the forearm, trunk, and buttock skin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —The {{fisheries}} literature embodies critical {{assumptions about}} fisherman attitudes and motivations. Common assumptions are that populations of fishermen are homogeneous in mo-tivation {{and decision making}} and that they behave in a myopic fashion, ignoring the effects of their fishing activities on the fishery resource. The results <b>of</b> a <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> trawl <b>vessel</b> captains challenge these assumptions.

We discuss the implications <b>of</b> these <b>survey</b> results for the design and implementation of fishery regulations, and for the ratio-nalization of fisheries. We note the potential costs of misrepresenting fishermen in models of fishery resource use. Implicit in models of open-access fisheries are assumptions about the behavior of resource users. Basic assumptions of Gordon's (1954) model of a common-property fishery and Hardin's later (1968) model of common-property resources are that re-source users are homogeneous in motivation an...|$|R
