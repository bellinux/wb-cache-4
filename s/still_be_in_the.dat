5|$|A person's {{history of}} taking {{paracetamol}} is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis. The {{most effective way}} to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug nomogram developed in 1975, called the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion. To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury. A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of being absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a serum level taken before 4hours is not recommended.|$|E

25|$|Experimental {{aluminum}} cents, 1974. During {{the early}} 1970s, {{the price of}} copper rose {{to a point where}} the cent almost contained one cent's worth of copper. This led the Mint to test alternate metals, including aluminum and bronze-clad steel. Aluminum was chosen, and in 1973, a total of 1,579,324 such coins were struck (dated 1974) and ready for public release. A few were distributed to members of the U.S. Congress, but aluminum was ultimately rejected for a variety of reasons. About a dozen aluminum cents are believed to <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of collectors, although they are now considered illegal to own. One aluminum cent was donated to the Smithsonian Institution. Another {{is in the hands of}} the family of a deceased U.S. Capitol police officer, known as the Toven Specimen, and was certified as authentic in 2005.|$|E

25|$|Christopher Eccleston {{discussed}} {{plans for}} the anniversary episode with Moffat, but eventually declined to return as the Ninth Doctor. Sylvester McCoy, who played the Seventh Doctor, claimed {{that none of the}} surviving actors who portrayed the Doctor prior to Eccleston were contacted regarding the special. Colin Baker confirmed this while being interviewed on Australian television alongside McCoy and Paul McGann. However, McGann {{went on to say that}} he could <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 50th but at the last moment. Radio Times reported rumours that a Doctor from the classic era (pre-2005) would feature in the special, citing unknown sources. Freema Agyeman and John Barrowman, who played Tenth Doctor companions Martha Jones and Jack Harkness, respectively, both stated they would not be in the 50th, but may return to the show at some point. Barrowman stated that he would have liked to be in it, but speculated that the producers wanted to try some different things.|$|E
25|$|The 11th Indian Infantry Division had {{suffered}} huge casualties, although some would eventually {{make their way}} back to join in the fight for Singapore, many more would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jungle after the surrender. Large numbers of these survivors would be captured but a few, like Lt. Colonel Lindsay Robertson (who had strong views about surrendering) and his party of Argylls attempted to evade capture, but were unable to keep ahead of the rapid advance of the Japanese. Robertson was killed on 20 January 1942. The remaining survivors from the two brigades were scattered all over the Malayan Peninsula. Some of the Argylls were still at large by August 1945. A Gurkha NCO, Naik Nakam Gurung, was found during the Malayan Emergency in October 1949, he had been living in the jungle since 1942. The 12th Indian Brigade had practically ceased to exist and the 28th Brigade was but a shadow.|$|E
25|$|On 17 November Rochambeau sent {{a message}} to Loring's {{squadron}} requesting that he be allowed to safely evacuate the port and return with his men to France. Loring refused, and so on 20 November the French general instead concluded a peace treaty with Dessalines, the terms of which insisted that the French garrison and population had to evacuate the port within ten days. Loring was informed of the terms of the agreement and although Rochambeau was ready to depart on 25 November, his ships crammed with thousands of refugees, the British squadron blocked all of the escape routes. On 30 November, as Haitian soldiers took possession of the vacated batteries and forts that protected the harbour, Rochambeau was still prevaricating, his ships lying at anchor directly under the guns of the forts. Orders were given to the Haitian garrisons to make preparations to fire heated roundshot at the French in order to burn their ships to the waterline should the squadron <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> harbour following the deadline. Concerned with the delay, Loring ordered Captain Bligh to enter the harbour and offer terms of surrender to Rochambeau.|$|E

25|$|By 6.30 am, Shimada's {{tanks were}} {{approaching}} the next battalion, the 2nd Bn, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders under Lt. Col. Lindsay Robertson. The 2nd Argylls were positioned around {{the village of}} Trolak itself and protected Stewart's 12th Brigade H.Q. This was a regular British Army battalion and very experienced, considered {{to be one of}} the best jungle fighting units the British had in Malaya. The Argylls were in a defensive position but without fixed anti-tank obstacles or mines. They had only a little warning of the rapidly approaching Japanese by the arrival of a few panic-stricken sepoys from the Hyderabads to erect a roadblock. Even with that warning though, the first four of Shimada's tanks were mistaken for Punjab Bren Carriers and drove straight through the Argylls, neatly dividing the battalion. These four tanks then headed for the railway bridge. The arrival of the remainder of Shimada's main force and Ando's infantry soon after, split the Argylls completely and cut them off from the road. The Argylls were reduced to many small groups but they fought ferociously and managed to delay the Japanese infantry longer than either of the other two battalions, holding them up until about 7.30 am. The force east of the road (C and B Companies) under Col. Robertson fought their way into the rubber estate and tried to flank the Japanese advance by heading south through the jungle inland and breaking up into small parties. Six weeks later some of these soldiers would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jungle. A Company (commanded by Lt. Donald Napier, a descendant of British General Charles Napier), west of the road, managed to break out of the encircling Japanese and cross the river before the rail bridge was blown. D Company, further north than Napier's company, suffered the same fate as Robertson's party of Argylls, having to scatter into the jungle and attempt to reach British lines. Most of D Company would be captured before they could reach the river. Only 94 Argylls answered roll call on 8 January, nearly all from Napier's A Company.|$|E

Orrec, holding no belief in the Ald god, is not allowed within the Gand's residence, but performs before an open pavilion. The relationship between the Gand Iorath and his son Iddor is seen to be tense: Iddor believes Orrec's poetry to be blasphemy. Some of Ansul's citizens, led by Sulter's friend Desac, hope to rouse the city against the Alds, taking advantage of the struggle between the Gand and his son. Desac asks Orrec to act as an instigator for a rebellion. When Orrec hesitates, the Waylord offers to consult the Oracle, revealed to <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house, about a rebellion. He tells Memer that their family has the responsibility of [...] "reading" [...] the Oracle, which provides answers in the pages of certain books in the secret room.

When asked why they set themselves on fire, Hao Huijun replied that she had realised the futility of writing letters and demonstrating by waving banners, [...] "so finally, we decided... to make a big event to show our will to the world....
