40|$|The {{observed}} {{errors in}} the position of the implanted prosthesis can be due to a number of potential causes. One of these is the potential error during execution of the bone cuts. However, there is only minimal information on this in the current literature. The amount of cutting errors in 40 consecutive total knee replacements was reported. All the operations were done by the same surgeon. The amount of cutting error was measured by the use of computer navigation system. It was hypothesized that {{there was no difference in}} the amount of error between bone cut through the <b>cutting</b> <b>slot</b> (<b>slotted</b> <b>cutting)</b> and bone cut done on the surface of the cutting guide (open cutting). It was found that the average absolute cutting error was 1 ° in the coronal plane and 1. 4 ° in the sagittal plane. Significantly more outlier (more than 3 °) was observed in the {{errors in the}} sagittal plane (P = 0. 014, chi square test). Open cutting resulted in less error in the sagittal plane of the tibial cut when compared with <b>slotted</b> <b>cutting</b> (P = 0. 031, Mann-Whitney U Test). This was attributed by the use of a thicker saw blade with higher stiffness in the open cutting method. © 2008 Springer-Verlag. postprin...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the design}} of most {{ultrasonic}} drills, it is difficult to drill much past an inch into very dense material. This is {{because of the lack of}} slurry, or cutting fluid, to reach the drill bit in order to keep it clean and effective. Rotational drills do not experience this phenomenon as much due to the <b>slotted</b> <b>cutting</b> bit, which allows access of cutting fluid to the tip of the bit. Ultrasonic drilling provides very little tolerance surrounding the bit, and so no such pathway is created.|$|R

With regard to dam {{remediation}} and upgrades, <b>slot</b> <b>cutting</b> projects are the company's main focus. It is akin to slicing a concrete dam {{like a piece of}} birthday cake. The technique is simple but very difficult, rotate a loop of cable strung with diamond embedded beads through the structure — essentially, like using a loop of fishing line to cut a cake. <b>Slot</b> <b>cutting</b> is employed to create expansion joints in dams afflicted with compression stresses due to concrete swelling. Alkali Aggregate Reaction, or AAR, is a chemical reaction in concrete created where the aggregate has a high silicon dioxide content. The southeast USA is one such region, and dams in that area require periodic slot cuts to avoid cracking, leakage, and interference with mechanical components such as gates and turbines. The time intervals depend on the AAR specifics of each structure, but 10 years is an average.|$|E

50|$|The {{fingerboard}} is {{a crucial}} part of the guitar. It is generally made up of ebony or rosewood. It is not flat in shape. At the one end of the fingerboard it has radius of 16, with this we achieve low action and also prevents buzz while string bending. At the other end of fingerboard, it has radius of 10 for the purpose of comfort. First of all, Design of fingerboard is prepared on some commercial software like,aspire. If it has some kind of additional aesthetic design, then how it will look like in reality, is interpreted. The aesthetic design is split and pieces, required for it, are sorted out in design. To get exact size and shape, separate design for pieces are prepared and code is generated. For precision work and repeatability, the cutting is done on cnc machine with the help of code. The cutting parameters are specified then pieces are cut. Also the radiusing is done on the fingerboard. Then pockets are generated on the fingerboard for the accommodation of pieces. Pieces are glued in the pockets. To get finish and removal of extra glue sanding is done on this. Wet wipe is done on this for cleaning and then oiling is done. After this fret <b>slot</b> <b>cutting</b> is done to put steel wire fret in that. At last nut pocket is generated for locking nut.|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} number of existing concrete dams are at present deteriorated by chemo-mechanical processes known as Alkali-Aggregate Reactions (AAR). This phenomenon is responsible for cracking and expansion of the material which lead to mechanical degradation of the structures operability and safety. Its chemo-mechanical modeling has been already dealt with by considering the influence of temperature, humidity, stiffness reduction and stress {{in the development of}} expansion. This modeling has first been developed as valid only for continuous media. In order to widen the field of modeling applicability, this paper describes a novel procedure for modeling displacement discontinuities in AAR-affected concrete structures, mainly to take into account two phenomena: firstly, the modeling of significant isolated cracks opening-closing that result from interactions between expansion and mechanical behavior of the structure; and secondly, the evaluation of the potential efficiency of stress release (e. g. sawing of dams), the procedure of which consists in the creation of <b>slot</b> <b>cutting</b> in the structure for release of excessive compressive stresses. The elaborated model, aimed to possibly combine contact elements and non-linear volume coupled models of durability mechanics related to AAR modeling, was applied to the 3 D simulations of a simplified model ideally representing a part of a dam and also to a real gravity dam. Displacements and stresses at the contact elements zone were computed and compared with results of the dam computations without contact elements. The results show that the creation of the <b>slot</b> <b>cutting</b> leads to decrease of the compressive stresses in the structure, which confirms a favorable effect of this stress release technique {{in order to deal with}} AAR affected structures...|$|E

40|$|Several {{million cubic}} feet of {{hazardous}} and radioactive waste was buried in shallow pits and trenches within many US Department of Energy (US DOE) sites.

40|$|A {{facility}} for rapid prototyping of MEMS devices {{is crucial for}} the development of novel miniaturised components in all sectors of high-tech industry, e. g. telecommunications, information technology, micro-optics and aerospace. To overcome the disadvantages of existing techniques in terms of cost and flexibility, a new approach has been taken to provide a tool for rapid prototyping and small-scale production: Complex CAD/CAM software has been developed that automatically generates the tool paths according to a CAD drawing of the MEMS device. As laser ablation is a much more complicated process than mechanical machining, for which such software has already been in use for many years, the generation of these tool paths relies not only on geometric considerations, but also on a sophisticated simulation module taking into account various material and laser parameters and micro-effects. The following laser machining options have been implemented: cutting, hole drilling, <b>slot</b> <b>cutting,</b> 2 D area clearing, pocketing and 2 D surface machining. Once the tool paths are available, a post processor translates this information into CNC commands that control a scanner head.

40|$|Abstract The {{knowledge}} of the temperature that develops between tools and the raw material is needed for optimizing the cutting parameters. A controlled Grinding experiment was compared with a thermo-mechanical finite elements model (FEM) simulating the temperature distributions and other effects occurring in the cutting zone. An electric Grinding was controlled by [Labview] software, keeping the torque and rotational speed constant and preventing disruption of fixed air flow. The processed material was glass ceramics, the mechanical and thermal properties of which are known from the literature.

The experiment {{was carried out by}} single <b>slot</b> <b>cutting,</b> without cooling. The value of cutting power was based on specific cutting energy (U), known from the literature and calculation of (MRR) from the cutting parameters (depth & width of cut, feed rate).

The fit obtained between dynamic model and the measurements enables a reliable calculation of the specific cutting energy (U) for every combination of tool cut and raw material...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade {{destruction}} of rock {{with the aid of}} a high speed water jet has been the subject of great interest. Most papers published in this field deal with experiments but very little has been done theoretically. It has generally been assumed that when a water jet hits the face of a rock this case is quite equivalent to the case when a bit is pressed into the rock, which means that the destruction of the rock is a fracture process caused by stresses. There are however some simple experiments that clearly indicate that this approach is incorrect. The results of the investigation presented here indicate that in rock destruction with a high speed water jet the relevant rock parameters are quite different from those of mechnical rock destruction. The author has shown with the aid of both theory and experiments that from erosion point of view a rock is characterized by two quantities, erosion resistance and threshold pressure.
