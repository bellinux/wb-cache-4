50|$|In areas {{subject to}} {{freezing}} and thawing, frost heaving can damage a pavement and create openings for water to enter. In the Spring, thaw of pavements accelerates this process when the thawing of upper {{portions of the}} soil structure in a pavement cannot drain past still-frozen lower layers, thus saturating the <b>supporting</b> <b>soil</b> and weakening it.|$|E

50|$|A pothole is a {{structural}} failure in a road surface, caused by failure primarily in asphalt pavement {{due to the}} presence of water in the underlying soil structure and the presence of traffic passing over the affected area. Introduction of water to the underlying soil structure first weakens the <b>supporting</b> <b>soil.</b> Traffic then fatigues and breaks the poorly supported asphalt surface in the affected area. Continued traffic action ejects both asphalt and the underlying soil material to create a hole in the pavement.|$|E

50|$|Polymer soil {{stabilization}} {{refers to the}} addition of polymers to improve the physical properties of soils, most often for geotechnical engineering, construction, or agricultural projects. Even at very small concentrations within soils, various polymers {{have been shown to}} increase water retention and reduce erosion, increase soil shear strength, and <b>support</b> <b>soil</b> structure. A wide range of polymers have been used to address problems ranging from the prevention of desertification to the reinforcement of roadbeds.|$|R
50|$|Soil {{characteristics}} {{that have been}} altered by addition of polymers include compressive strength, volume stability, hydraulic durability, and conductivity. Polymers can help prevent soil erosion and increase infiltration of water by strengthening soil aggregates and <b>supporting</b> <b>soil</b> structure. The properties of the soil itself are a dominant control {{on the ability of}} polymers to interact with it. A study of the cationic, alkaline polymer SS299 (a commercially produced additive) found that the properties of treated soils depend on the plasticity index of the original soil, which reflects its clay content.|$|E

These problems require a multidisciplinary approach to properly model the behavior of the structure and its interaction with the <b>supporting</b> <b>soil.</b> This article is intended to contribute to these aspects, by showing how identification analyses can highlight the role of soil-structure interaction, and focuses on the model-updating techniques to forecast its behavior under seismic event...|$|E
30|$|The {{response}} of the structure affects the motion of <b>supporting</b> <b>soil</b> {{and the movement of}} <b>supporting</b> <b>soil</b> influences the structural behaviour. This inter-dependency of response between the structure and the soil is referred as SSI. Depending on the modelling method for the soil stratum, all the SSI problems can be classified into two main categories, namely direct method and substructure method (Wolf 1985). The direct method evaluates the {{response of}} structure and its surrounding soil in a single analysis step by subjecting the combined soil–structure system to applied loads. The finite element analysis can be easily implemented in this method of SSI. In substructure approach, the soil–structure system is divided into two or more substructures. Each substructure is modelled independently and the general structure is formed by connecting these individual substructures through the interface of adjacent or other substructures. The substructure method is based on the principle of superposition.|$|E

40|$|Several {{geotechnical}} {{engineering structures}} (e. g. pavements, slabs-on-grade, footings) transfer {{pressure to the}} ground through a contact area with the <b>supporting</b> <b>soil.</b> Design of these structures usually assumes that full contact is established throughout the service life of the structure. Erosion of the subgrade soil is a common mechanism {{that can lead to}} the development of subsurface voids and consequently a contact loss between the structure and the <b>supporting</b> <b>soil</b> characterized by a void space under the structure. The performance of surface structures such as concrete pavements, slabs-on-grade, and sidewalks subjected to subsurface soil erosion is investigated experimentally and numerically in this thesis. The experiments were performed in a rigid tank holding a prism of sand with artificially created soil erosion; supporting a rigid steel plate. The surface deformation and contact pressure at the plate-soil interface were measured to quantify the effect of subsurface soil erosion on the stresses developing in the surface structure. Numerical modeling was conducted using 2 D elasto-plastic finite element analysis. The model was first validated using the experimental results. Several scenarios were then considered where parameters such as the volume of soil erosion, its location, and the magnitude of the load the concrete slab is subjected to, were varied. Results of this investigation indicated that when the void space is centered under the slab-on-grade, tensile stresses developing in the structure increased as the size of the void increased causing ultimately the failure of the slab. It has also been concluded that when the void is offcentered, the <b>supporting</b> <b>soil</b> around the void space is likely to experience shear failure before excessive tensile stresses develop in the outermost fibers of the structure...|$|E

40|$|Findings from {{previous}} {{studies have indicated that}} a reinforced concrete wall with a structural hinge at the base, used to reduce the strength requirement for the foundation, can be effective for limiting the drift demand for frames subjected to strong ground motions. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the development of a hinge at the foundation, rather than at the wall, would affect the behavior of the building negatively. A series of 17 of small-scale foundation models supported on sand was conducted in order to calibrate a numerical model proposed in this study and to formulate simplified relations for the response of foundations in buildings subjected to ground motions. Drift responses for two structures representative of medium and high-rise residential buildings in Turkey, were calculated with and without foundation yielding assuming that the <b>supporting</b> <b>soil</b> consisted of the sand used in the experimental program of this study. It was found that foundation yielding did not negatively affect the drift responses of the structures because the <b>supporting</b> <b>soil</b> provided sufficient energy dissipation/deformation capacity. ...|$|E

40|$|Effect of <b>supporting</b> <b>soil</b> on the {{response}} of structure has been analyzed in the present study. A low rise (G+ 5 storey) and a high rise (G+ 12 storey) building has been taken for the analysis. For both type of buildings, {{the response}} of building with and without consideration of soil structure interaction effect has been compared. Without interaction case {{is the case in}} which ends of the structure are assumed to be fixed while in interaction case, structure is assumed to be resting on soil strata (ends are not fix). Type of <b>supporting</b> <b>soil</b> has been also changed based on modulus of elasticity of soil (soft, medium and hard soil). STAAD Pro. 2006 software has been used for analysis. It has been observed that response of G+ 12 storey building is affected more by soil structure interaction effect as compared to G+ 5 storey building. In case of soft soil {{the response of}} both type of buildings are changed very drastically compared to without interaction case. While in case of hard soil there is not much difference in response of buildings compared to without interaction case. Medium soil is showing intermediate effects...|$|E
