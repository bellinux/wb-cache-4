50|$|During a key {{exchange}} entities A and B {{will each}} transmit information 2 (mod p2) coefficients defining an elliptic curve and 2 elliptic curve points. Each elliptic curve coefficient requires log2p2 bits. Each elliptic curve point {{can be transmitted}} in log2p2+1 bits, hence the transmission is 8log2p + 2 bits. This is 6144 bits for a 768-bit modulus p (128-bit security). However, this can be reduced by over half to 2640 bits (330 bytes) using key-compression techniques, the latest of which appears in recent work by authors Costello, Jao, Longa, Naehrig, Renes and Urbanik. With these compression techniques, SIDH has a similar bandwidth requirement to traditional 3072-bit RSA signatures or Diffie-Hellman key exchanges. This <b>small</b> <b>space</b> <b>requirement</b> makes SIDH applicable to context that have a strict space requirement, such as Bitcoin or Tor. Tor's data cells must be less than 517 bytes in length, so they can hold 330-byte SIDH keys. By contrast, NTRUEncrypt must exchange approximately 600 bytes to achieve a 128-bit security and cannot be used within Tor without increasing the cell size.|$|E

The Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) technology, a {{state-of-the-art}} wastewater treatment process that combines an activated sludge process and membrane filtration, has received worldwide {{recognition in the}} past decade.

40|$|Over 18 {{billion barrels}} of waste fluids are {{generated}} annually from {{oil and gas production}} in the United States. As a large amount of water is used for oilfield operations, treating and reusing produced water can cut the consumption of fresh water in well sites. This research has helped to develop a membrane process train for a mobile produced water treatment unit for treating oilfield produced brine for reuse. To design the process train, over 30 sets of combination tests at pilot laboratory scale were performed using pretreatment, microfiltration and nanofiltration processes. Membrane performance was selected based on high flux separation efficiency, high tolerance for solids and fluid treatments. Over 95 % solids rejection and greater than 80 % oil removal efficiency were obtained in all these tests. Process train (pre-treatment and membrane) performance was monitored by chemical analysis of permeate and models fitting experimental data for the process. From the results, hydrocarbon rejection was analyzed; total organic carbon rejection was 47. 9 %, total carbon content averaged 37. 3 % rejection and total inorganic carbon rejection was at 3. 66 %. BTEX removal efficiency ranged from 0. 98 % to 52. 7 % with the progressive pretreatment methods of using cartridge filters. The nanofiltration membrane showed significant reduction in total dissolved solids and in both anionic and cationic species. 	 The process train is seen to follow a sequence of treatment from cartridge and oil removal filter treatment to microfiltration treatment to ultrafiltration, followed by nanofiltration {{for the purpose of this}} research. Further research still needs to be done on to determine the kind of analytical test which will give real time feedback on effectiveness of filters. In summary, the process train developed by TAMU-GPRI possesses distinct advantages in treating oilfield produced brine using membrane technology. These advantages include high quality of permeate, reduced sludge and the possibility of total recycle water systems. The <b>small</b> <b>space</b> <b>requirement,</b> moderate capital costs and ease of operation associated with the use of the mobile unit membrane technology also makes it a very competitive alternative to conventional technologies...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 127 - 132). xvi, 132 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmThe entrapped-mixed-microbial-cell-biobarrel (EMMC-biobarrel) processes {{with both}} configurations of single-layer and double-layer were investigated {{for the removal}} of carbon and nitrogen simultaneously from synthetic-domestic wastewater with a CODIN ratio of 5 under various operational conditions. For the single-layer systems, the carrier was employed at the packing ratios of 10 % and 20 % based on the bioreactor water volume. In the double-layer system, carriers were separated into two layers which occupied the top and bottom parts of the reactor with an overall packing ratio of 13 %. At the organic and nitrogen loading of O. 75 kg COD/m 3 /day and 0. 16 kg NH 3 -N/m 3 /day, all these systems achieved more than 96 % of SCOD removal and NH 3 -N removal efficiencies under continuous aeration. The double-layer system achieved about 40 % of total nitrogen removal, which was comparable with the single-layer system with packing ratio of 20 % but higher than the single-layer system with a packing ratio of 10 %. The SRT for the double-layer system and single-layer system with a packing ratio of 20 % could be achieved to more than 200 days. Based on the economics analysis, in the achievement of comparable performance, the capital cost for the double-layer configuration was lower than that for the single-layer configuration. Therefore, double layer configuration is recommended for the EMMC-biobarrel process design. EMMC-biobarrel process offers many advantages over the existing wastewater treatment processes including <b>small</b> <b>space</b> <b>requirement,</b> simple operation and maintenance and. improved nitrogen removal. It demonstrates great potential for onsite, small scale/land limited wastewater treatment applications. The installation cost for an EMMC-biobarrel treatment unit with capacity of 400 gallons/day and 1, 500 gallons/day are estimated as $ 4, 671 and $ 10, 191, respectively, which are comparable or lower than those for the existing commercial products which also involve the nitrogen removal technology. For small sca 1 e/land limited application, the total cost requirement is about $ 0. 90 per 1000 gallons for treating settled domestic sewage per day...|$|E
40|$|Microsystems, {{consisting}} of integrated circuits (IC, CMOS), microsensors such as microactuators, can be build up monolithically {{as well as}} hybrid. These systems enable {{a high degree of}} functionality to be made with at the same time high level of integration density. While microsensors for such systems are far developed and commercially available, microactuators, which are needed for the control of energy or mass flows, are still at the beginning. The operational areas of control drives in microtechnical applications (microactuators) are various and lie within the range of micropumps, microvalves but also microswitches for the control of electric currents or voltages (microrelays) or for the specific refraction of light (micromirror). These applications require large strokes or deflections from the control drive with at the same time high switching frequencies as low CMOS-compatible applied voltages. With the piezoelectric drive principle high switching cycles are possible with low power consumption and <b>small</b> <b>space</b> <b>requirement.</b> To reach a high level of integration density piezoelectric materials with high piezoelectric coefficients, like lead zirconate titanate [Pb {Zr(x) Ti(1 -x) } O 3, PZT], have to be selected for the active layer. For this layer suitable techniques for the integration into a CMOS process have to be developed. In the context of this thesis a control drive was developed with piezoelectric energy transformation principle in a modified IC process flow on silicon substrates. The control drive was manufactured in a process {{consisting of}} procedures of microelectronics, bulk micromechanics and CSD (Chemical Solution deposition) technology. The characterisation of the microactuators took place at capacitive test-structures and at freely movable cantilever structures. Here the control drives appeared to be fully functionally with tip deflections up to 70 µm at applied voltages up to 10 V. For an exact evaluation of the mechanical and electrical characteristics of the piezoelectric control drive the tip deflection of the cantilever structure is needed. To determine this mechanical characteristic an experimental setup consisting of a laser interferometer was developed, with which the tip deflection {{as a function of the}} applied voltage could be measured. Additionally, the dynamic characteristics of the cantilever structures could be determined with this setup. Other important layer properties such as permittivity, electrical losses, resistivity, breakdown voltage and the ferroelectrical properties of the PZT layers were determined by CV, SE and hysteresis measurements. In addition, to the mechanical and electrical measurements XRD analyses of the crystal structure of the metallic electrodes and the piezoelectric layers were accomplished. For the achievement of good piezoelectric characteristics a specific preferred orientation in both layers is necessary. With the help of these analyses the desired textures in the material system could be proven. Important aspects in micromechanics are the tensions (stress) in complex layer systems, which can lead to unwanted deflection of cantilever structures. Therefore in the context of this work the stress influence of the different layers on each other was examined. This led to the integration of a stress compensation layer. With the help of this optimised process flow and the developed fabrication methods piezoelectric control drives were manufactured as lab samples. The full functionality of the microactuators could be shown in the context of the requirements...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{development}} {{in the field of}} mobile communication, digital signal processing (DSP) motivated the design engineer to integrate complex systems of multimillion transistors in a single chip. The integration of the transistor in a single chip greatly increases the performance of the system while reduction in system size. Recently, there is a considerable increase in the application front in several areas of engineering and technology. Moore’s law states that integration density gets doubled every two years, so the complexity of the integrated circuits also increases by keeping the used chip area constant. In order {{to keep pace with the}} levels of integration available, design engineers have developed new methodologies and techniques to manage the increased complexity in these large chips. System-on-Chip (SOC) design is proposed as an extended methodology to this problem where pre-designed and pre-verified IP cores of embedded processors, memory blocks, interface blocks, and analog blocks are combined on a single chip targeting a specific application. These chips may have one or more processors on chip, a large amount of memory, bus-base architectures, peripherals, co processors, and I/O channels. These chips integrates systems far more similar to the boards designed ten years ago that to the chips of even a few years ago. The primary drivers for this are the reduction of power, smaller form factor, and lower overall cost. SOC offers many benefits such as <b>smaller</b> <b>space</b> <b>requirements</b> with higher performance. ...|$|R
