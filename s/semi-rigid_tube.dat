50|$|Pachycerianthus fimbriatus is a {{cerianthid anemone}} that burrows in {{substrate}} {{and lives in}} a <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>tube</b> made of felted nematocysts. The anemone is often seen in bright orange to red.|$|E
5000|$|For use in more strenuous environments, a {{much more}} robust cable {{construction}} is required. In loose-tube construction the fiber is laid helically into <b>semi-rigid</b> <b>tubes,</b> allowing the cable to stretch without stretching the fiber itself. This protects the fiber from tension during laying and due to temperature changes. Loose-tube fiber may be [...] "dry block" [...] or gel-filled. Dry block offers less protection to the fibers than gel-filled, but costs considerably less. Instead of a loose tube, the fiber may be embedded in a heavy polymer jacket, commonly called [...] "tight buffer" [...] construction. Tight buffer cables are offered {{for a variety of}} applications, but the two most common are [...] "Breakout" [...] and [...] "Distribution". Breakout cables normally contain a ripcord, two non-conductive dielectric strengthening members (normally a glass rod epoxy), an aramid yarn, and 3 mm buffer tubing with an additional layer of Kevlar surrounding each fiber. The ripcord is a parallel cord of strong yarn that is situated under the jacket(s) of the cable for jacket removal. Distribution cables have an overall Kevlar wrapping, a ripcord, and a 900 micrometer buffer coating surrounding each fiber. These fiber units are commonly bundled with additional steel strength members, again with a helical twist to allow for stretching.|$|R
50|$|Detachable light guides, {{consisting}} of rigid bent plastic rods or <b>semi-rigid</b> or flexible <b>tubes</b> containing optical fibers, {{are available for}} some flashlights for inspection inside tanks, or within walls or structures; when not required the light guide can be removed and the light used for other purposes.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings of}} new laboratory experiments on the frequency response of <b>semi-rigid</b> manometer <b>tubes</b> {{for use in}} monitoring coastal hydrodynamic processes, extending and improving upon the previous work of Nielsen et al. (1993). An adjustable speed rotary electromotor was used to drive a known water level variation {{at one end of}} the tube and the pressure was measured at both ends of the tube, enabling a direct determination of the tube 2 ̆ 7 s frequency response. Testing was conducted over a range of frequencies (0. 0067 H...|$|R
40|$|High cadence, multi-wavelength {{observations}} and simulations are employed {{for the analysis}} of solar photospheric magnetic bright points (MBPs) in the quiet Sun. The observations were obtained with the Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) imager and the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) at the Dunn Solar Telescope. Our analysis reveals that photospheric MBPs have an average transverse velocity of approximately 1 km/s, whereas their chromospheric counterparts have a slightly higher average velocity of 1. 4 km/s. Additionally, chromospheric MBPs were found to be around 63 % larger than the equivalent photospheric MBPs. These velocity values were compared with the output of numerical simulations generated using the MURaM code. The simulated results were similar, but slightly elevated, when compared to the observed data. An average velocity of 1. 3 km/s was found in the simulated G-band images and an average of 1. 8 km/s seen in the velocity domain at a height of 500 km above the continuum formation layer. Delays in the change of velocities were also analysed. Average delays of ~ 4 s between layers of the simulated data set were established and values of ~ 29 s observed between G-band and Ca II K ROSA observations. The delays in the simulations are likely {{to be the result of}} oblique granular shock waves, whereas those found in the observations are possibly the result of a <b>semi-rigid</b> flux <b>tube.</b> Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS Main Journal, 7 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

The observations were obtained with the Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) imager and the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer at the Dunn Solar Telescope. Our analysis reveals that photospheric MBPs have an average transverse velocity of approximately 1 km s− 1, whereas their chromospheric counterparts have a slightly higher average velocity of 1. 4 km s− 1. Additionally, chromospheric MBPs were found to be around 63 per cent larger than the equivalent photospheric MBPs. These velocity values were compared with the output of numerical simulations generated using the MURAM code. The simulated results were similar, but slightly elevated, when compared to the observed data. An average velocity of 1. 3 km s− 1 was found in the simulated G-band images and an average of 1. 8 km s− 1 seen in the velocity domain at a height of 500 km above the continuum formation layer.

40|$|Catheters are <b>semi-rigid,</b> hollow plastic <b>tubes</b> {{that are}} {{indispensable}} {{when it comes}} to local surgery inside the heart,brain,arms, legs, or lungs. But how can a surgeon tell whether the catheter is going the right way? Most hospitals still use x-ray methods to check the catheters progress. To navigate the catheters passage in real time, some ten to twenty x-ray images are made every second. Even though the radiation dose involved is very low, no radiation at all would be much healthier both for the patient and the medical staff who run the risk of being exposed to the radiation on a daily basis. Researchers of the TU Delft faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science are currently developing a magnetic navigation system for medical instruments such as catheters and guide wires. A magnetic sensor on the tip of the medical instrument measures an external magnetic field and reports exactly where the tip of the instrument is located. In addition, the team is developing sensors that can measure a number of blood parameters simultaneously. Current systems allow the doctors to measure only a single parameter at a time so that a new catheter has to be inserted for each subsequent reading. A reduction in size of the sensors will bring this to an end. Delft University of Technolog...|$|R
