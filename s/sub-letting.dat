2500|$|The {{liberty and}} castle of Penrith {{became the most}} {{important}} offices held by the Neville family in the fifteenth century, and their most important source of patronage locally. By 1441, Salisbury was <b>sub-letting</b> the lordship of Penrith to Lumley, bishop of Carlisle, [...] until 1444, who was then Warden of the West March, and Professor A.J. Pollard has estimated that 'the Nevilles’ Penrith estates were worth approximately £350.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Christie {{moved out}} of 10 Rillington Place on 20 March 1953, after fraudulently <b>sub-letting</b> his flat to a couple from whom he took £7 13s 0d (£7.65 or about £ as of [...] ). The {{landlord}} visited that same evening and, finding the couple there instead of Christie, demanded that they leave first thing the next morning. The landlord then allowed the tenant of the top-floor flat, Beresford Brown, to use Christie's kitchen. On 24March, Brown discovered the kitchen alcove when he attempted to insert brackets into the wall to hold a wireless set. Peeling back the wallpaper, Brown saw the bodies of Maloney, Nelson and MacLennan. After getting confirmation from another tenant in 10Rillington Place that they were dead bodies, Brown informed the police and a citywide search for Christie began.|$|E

She was the <b>sub-letting</b> occupier; she squeezed out a precarious living by taking the house whole and <b>sub-letting</b> it in detail and she made her food and got the shelter of an attic above and a basement below by the transaction. And if she didn't chance to [...] "let" [...] steadily, out she went to pauperdom and some other poor, sordid old adventurer tried in her place....|$|E

[...] "One quarter of the sum will serve to purchase the absolute necessities of life in a country where fruit can be had for the labor of gathering, and in ten years they can well afford to retire from business, or become landed proprietors by leasing logwood cuttings, <b>sub-letting</b> the land to those who will pay fifteen cents a hundred pounds for all that can be gathered." ...|$|E
60|$|Herein lay {{the truth}} about the Duke of Dulham's visit and the error of Mr. Lucullus Fyshe. Mr. Fyshe was {{thinking}} that the Duke had come to lend money. In reality he had come to borrow it. In fact, the Duke was reckoning that by putting a second mortgage on Dulham Towers for twenty thousand sterling, and by selling his Scotch shooting and leasing his Irish grazing and <b>sub-letting</b> his Welsh coal rent he could raise altogether a hundred thousand pounds. This for a duke, is an enormous sum. If he once had it {{he would be able to}} pay off the first mortgage on Dulham Towers, buy in the rights of the present tenant of the Scotch shooting and the claim of the present mortgagee of the Irish grazing, and in fact be just where he started. This is ducal finance, which moves always in a circle.|$|E
50|$|The {{availability}} of affordable Video {{players and the}} convenience of cassette hire further reduced attendance at picture theatres during the 1980s. Malanda Little Theatre Company, which later became the Malanda Theatre Company, leased the Majestic Picture Theatre for 15 years in 1981. They staged theatrical plays and in turn <b>sub-let</b> the building for film screenings. One day a month, the building was <b>sub-let</b> to stall holders for a market before this {{was transferred to the}} Malanda Showgrounds. The Majestic was leased to Stuart Cardwell in 1990, who operated it in a share arrangement with the Malanda Theatre Company until 2004.|$|R

60|$|I am {{doubtful}} if many {{of these}} houses had any long use as the residences of single families if {{from the very first}} almost their tenants did not makeshift and take lodgers and sublet. They were built with basements, in which their servants worked and lived--servants of a more submissive and troglodytic generation who did not mind stairs. The dining-room (with folding doors) was a little above the ground level, and in that the wholesome boiled and roast with damp boiled potatoes and then pie to follow, was consumed and the numerous family read and worked in the evening, and above was the drawing-room (also with folding doors), where the infrequent callers were received. That was the vision at which those industrious builders aimed. Even while these houses were being run up, the threads upon the loom of fate were shaping to abolish altogether the type of household that would have fitted them. Means of transit were developing to carry the moderately prosperous middle-class families out of London, education and factory employment were whittling away at the supply of rough, hardworking, obedient girls who would stand the subterranean drudgery of these places, new classes of hard-up middle-class people such as my uncle, employees of various types, were coming into existence, for whom no homes were provided. None of these classes have ideas of what they ought to be, or fit in any legitimate way into the Bladesover theory that dominates our minds. It was nobody's concern to see them housed under civilised conditions, and the beautiful laws of supply and demand had free play. They had to squeeze in. The landlords came out financially intact from their blundering enterprise. More and more these houses fell into the hands of married artisans, or struggling widows or old servants with savings, who became responsible for the quarterly rent and tried to sweat a living by <b>sub-letting</b> furnished or unfurnished apartments.|$|E
60|$|Rowland had {{received}} {{a few days before}} a letter from a lady of his acquaintance, a worthy Scotswoman domiciled in a villa upon one of the olive-covered hills near Florence. She held her apartment in the villa upon a long lease, and she enjoyed for a sum not worth mentioning the possession of an extraordinary number of noble, stone-floored rooms, with ceilings vaulted and frescoed, and barred windows commanding the loveliest view in the world. She was a needy and thrifty spinster, who never hesitated to declare that the lovely view was all very well, but that for her own part she lived in the villa for cheapness, and that if she had a clear three hundred pounds a year she would go and really enjoy life near her sister, a baronet's lady, at Glasgow. She was now proposing to make a visit to that exhilarating city, and she desired to turn an honest penny by <b>sub-letting</b> for a few weeks her historic Italian chambers. The terms on which she occupied them enabled her to ask a rent almost jocosely small, and she begged Rowland to do what she called a little genteel advertising for her. Would he say a good word for her rooms to his numerous friends, as they left Rome? He said a good word for them now to Mrs. Hudson, and told her in dollars and cents how cheap a summer's lodging she might secure. He dwelt upon the fact that she would strike a truce with tables-d'hote and have a cook of her own, amenable possibly to instruction in the Northampton mysteries. He had touched a tender chord; Mrs. Hudson became almost cheerful. Her sentiments upon the table-d'hote system and upon foreign household habits generally were remarkable, and, if we had space for it, would repay analysis; and the idea of reclaiming a lost soul to the Puritanic canons of cookery quite lightened the burden of her depression. While Rowland set forth his case Roderick was slowly walking round the magnificent Adam, with his hands in his pockets. Rowland waited for him to manifest an interest in their discussion, but the statue seemed to fascinate him and he remained calmly heedless. Rowland was a practical man; he possessed conspicuously what is called the sense of detail. He entered into Mrs. Hudson's position minutely, and told her exactly why it seemed good that she should remove immediately to the Florentine villa. She received his advice with great frigidity, looking hard at the floor and sighing, like a person well on her guard against an insidious optimism. But she had nothing better to propose, and Rowland received her permission to write to his friend that he had let the rooms.|$|E
