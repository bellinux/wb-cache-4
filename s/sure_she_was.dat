25|$|Little {{is known}} of the early life of Agnes Salm-Salm. Many {{scholars}} believe that she worked in a circus, then as an actress in Cuba. In 1861 {{she returned to the}} United States but soon left her home in Vermont to visit her sister in Washington, D.C. who was getting married. Agnes stayed around Washington when she met Prince Felix Salm-Salm, a soldier of fortune, and a distant relation to the Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungary. She had been riding her horse one morning through the city when Felix first saw her and he made <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> invited to a party that he would be attending. Soon Felix proposed to her and they were married in August 30, 1862, despite opposition from her family (he was Catholic and she was Protestant).|$|E
25|$|The San Francisco Bay Area Reporter, Inc., a free weekly {{newspaper}} serving the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) {{communities in the}} area, {{were one of the}} first to comment on their discontent with the matter:We have repeatedly voiced our displeasure over the transgender/lesbian storyline between Zarf/Zoe and Bianca. We disagree with the basic premise, Zarf/Zoe as a MTF transgendered lesbian. We want Bianca to be with a woman (and she did have a one-night stand with Leslie on New Year’s Eve, which has to be a first for a daytime soap). We don’t want her already messy love life in which she has never been allowed to have a fully realized relationship with another woman (her first lover went crazy and was institutionalized, her next was killed, the next was a corporate thief who then had to return to Poland, the next identical twin of the one who was killed wasn’t <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> even queer and then left her for another woman). We don’t want her life complicated with the complexities of a transgender relationship.|$|E

500|$|Szilárd {{set out for}} Long Island {{again on}} August 2. Wigner was unavailable, so this time Szilárd co-opted another Hungarian physicist, Edward Teller, to do the driving. Einstein {{dictated}} the letter in German. On returning to Columbia University, Szilárd dictated the letter in English to a young departmental stenographer, Janet Coatesworth. She later recalled that when Szilárd mentioned extremely powerful bombs, she [...] "was <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> working for a nut". Ending the letter with [...] "Yours truly, Albert Einstein" [...] did nothing to alter this impression. Both the letter and a longer explanatory letter were then posted to Einstein.|$|E
500|$|Kat Dennings plays Norah Silverberg, {{the teenage}} {{daughter}} of a wealthy record producer who shares Nick's passion for music. Dennings was the second actor to be cast (Cera having been first), Sollett saying that [...] "her being liberated from [...] liberated the film in many ways, and certainly her character from cliché." [...] Dennings felt that she related to Norah {{more than any other}} she had played before and [...] "wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> really fleshed out". Her favorite day of shooting was with a group of drag queens at a gay cabaret, but she said that filming Norah's first orgasm was [...] "really uncomfortable... Really, really." ...|$|E
500|$|After Katsura {{arrived in}} the U.S., she gave a private {{exhibition}} for Cochran, who wanted to make <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> as good as reported before finalizing the invitation. At that meeting she clicked off runs of 300 and 400 at straight rail, made {{in the words of}} Cochran [...] "almost unbelievable shots" [...] after switching to balkline, and showed high competence at three-cushion, consistently scoring. Cochran made the invite [...] "final" [...] and stated: [...] "She's the most marvelous thing I ever saw... She's liable to beat anybody, even Willie Hoppe... I could not see any weak spots... She's going to give lots of those players fits." [...] As a warm-up for the competition Katsura gave a number of billiard exhibitions during February 1952.|$|E

500|$|Pauline's exit in December 2006 was {{described}} by The Times critic, Tim Teeman, as a landmark episode and a [...] "significant sayonara". He described scenes between Pauline and Dot as [...] "the most moving in a soap this year" [...] and added that [...] "it was a delight to finally alight on an episode... that was so satisfying." [...] Conversely, Pauline's exit {{was described}} as a [...] "mess" [...] by Kevin O'Sullivan, critic of the Sunday Mirror newspaper. He branded the character's final scene unconvincing and badly acted, commenting: [...] "the appropriately feeble scene brought down the curtain on 20 terrible years of Wendy Richard's low-quality performances. We shall not see her like again. If we're lucky! ... I'm certain millions didn't tune in to say farewell to sour- faced Pauline. No, they were just checking to make <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> really dead." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Rascals", Ro, Picard, Guinan and Keiko O'Brien (Rosalind Chao) are {{transformed}} into adolescent versions of themselves while retaining their adult intelligence. As children, they foil a Ferengi plot {{to steal the}} Enterprise and sell the crew as slave labor. In her final episode, [...] "Preemptive Strike", Ro returns to the Enterprise as a Lieutenant after spending a year at Starfleet Advanced Tactical Training. During {{the course of the}} training, her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Chakotay, resigned from Starfleet to join the Maquis when his father is killed by the Cardassians. She is asked by Starfleet to infiltrate the rebel Maquis, who are undermining the Federation treaty with Cardassia. During the mission, she finds her loyalties in conflict with her duties as she becomes increasingly sympathetic to the plight of the Maquis. Despite Picard's effort to force her to do her duty, she joins the rebel group. Riker says she seemed pretty <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> doing the right thing, though she regretted disappointing Picard.|$|E
500|$|The 2001 film Legally Blonde {{marked a}} turning point in Witherspoon's career; she starred as Elle Woods, a fashion-merchandising major who decides to become a law student in order to follow her ex-boyfriend to Harvard Law School. Witherspoon said about the role, [...] "When I read Legally Blonde, I was like, 'She's from Beverly Hills, she's rich, she's in a sorority. She has a great boyfriend. Oh yeah, she gets dumped. Who cares? I still hate her.' So we had to make <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the kind of person you just can't hate." [...] Legally Blonde was a box-office hit, {{grossing}} US$96 million domestically. Witherspoon's performance earned her praise from critics, as the press began referring to her as [...] "the new Meg Ryan". Roger Ebert commented, [...] "Witherspoon effortlessly animated this material with sunshine and quick wit", and Salon.com noted that [...] "she [...] delineates Elle's character beautifully". Meanwhile, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer concluded, [...] "Witherspoon is a talented comedian who can perk up a scene just by marching in full of pep and drive and she powers this modest little comedy almost single-handedly." [...] For her work, Witherspoon garnered her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and an MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.|$|E

500|$|Upon Burton's casting, it was {{revealed}} by MSN that Dylan, who was described as [...] "the mysterious ex Avery keeps bringing up" [...] by Jillian Bowe of Zap2it, {{would be involved in}} a love triangle with his ex-girlfriend Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins) and her current lover, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Of Dylan's storyline and involvement in the love triangle, Phelps said: [...] "Dylan does come to town to find Avery but this story has much more complexity than that [...] What {{you think is going to}} happen is not what's going to happen." [...] She noted that Avery was the [...] "great love of his life", though she may not have [...] "the same feelings for him." [...] Avery believed that Dylan died during war; TVLine commented that [...] "such a resurrection" [...] would [...] "surely" [...] derail her romance with Nick. During an interview with MSN, Burton said, [...] "Nick and Dylan will definitely fight for her, but ultimately, it's going to be her choice." [...] Dylan and Avery had an affair while she was still married to her ex-husband, but still had a [...] "great relationship", which was shown through flashbacks. Dylan's primary goal in coming to Genoa City was to make <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> happy, and if she wanted to get back together. Burton said that Dylan can't get Avery off his mind despite the fact that she had moved on.|$|E
2500|$|Catherine {{was buried}} in her garden on Lot 34. [...] Catherine and William’s {{neighbor}} Charles Julyan recorded going to Nahnebahwequa’s funeral, where at her own request, she {{was buried in}} her garden. [...] This is substantiated in Julyan's letter to Joseph Howe in 1871. [...] Catherine made <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> buried on the very lot for which she {{had been trying to}} get a deed. This certainly was one way they could not remove her. One way or another she was staying.|$|E
2500|$|Count Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov (17371808), {{brother of}} the above, {{was by far the}} ablest member of the Orlov count family, and was also {{remarkable}} for his athletic strength and dexterity. In the palace revolution of 1762 he played an even more important part than his brother Gregory. It is alleged that he conveyed Peter III to the chateau of Ropsha and murdered him there with his own hands. (However, this is only conjecture, though Orlov's involvement is often cited and widely believed. It's believed that Catherine made <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> nowhere near and claimed not to know of the murder until it was accomplished; sometimes it is said, against her will.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2007, Davis free-soloed Pervertical Sanctuary (5.11a), {{which was}} her goal, a {{difficult}} route {{at the east}} face of Longs Peak (...) , a thousand-foot granite wall known as [...] "The Diamond" [...] in Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. She repeated the feat on 13 September with Peter Mortimer filming. Famous among climbers, Ryan Minton explains in his article about Davis' achievement that [...] "The Diamond {{is one of the}} most revered alpine walls in North America" [...] and all of the climbing routes on it are extremely difficult. To be fully prepared and be <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not bothered by other climbers, Davis slept close to the peak itself on 3 September and began climbing at 4:15am. Interviewed after the climb, Davis said that positive thinking was central to her success as well as knowing that she was carrying very little gear and the conception of herself as a crack climber. Davis is the first woman to free solo the Diamond and the second person to free solo the Pervertical Sanctuary route (the other is Derek Hersey).|$|E
2500|$|A 1934 New Yorker article {{reported}} that at her execution she wore [...] "a neat Amazonian tailored suit, especially {{made for the}} occasion, {{and a pair of}} new white gloves" [...] though another account indicates she wore the same suit, low-cut blouse and tricorn hat ensemble which had been picked out by her accusers for her to wear at trial, and which was still the only full, clean outfit which she had in prison. Neither description matches photographic evidence. Wales recorded her death, saying that after the volley of shots rang out, [...] "Slowly, inertly, she settled to her knees, her head up always, and without the slightest change of expression on her face. For the fraction of a second it seemed she tottered there, on her knees, gazing directly at those who had taken her life. Then she fell backward, bending at the waist, with her legs doubled up beneath her." [...] A non-commissioned officer then walked up to her body, pulled out his revolver, and shot her in the head to make <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dead.|$|E
2500|$|Salli Frattini, the {{executive}} producer for MTV who had planned the entire performance, recalled {{a phone call from}} the officiating booth that was her first indication something had gone wrong. Frattini was in a truck outside of Reliant Stadium celebrating the end of the 12-minute halftime performance, which they initially thought was a success. [...] "We were like, 'Uh, we’re playing that back right now'", Frattini said. [...] "There was lots of chaos in the truck, and we played it back and we were like, 'Oh, s. What just happened?'" [...] Alex Coletti, another MTV producer, said he could not find Jackson after the performance. [...] "I tried to get in touch to make <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> okay", he said. [...] "Her entire camp stopped answering the phones. I finally got to her tour manager, and they were already at the airport." [...] Coletti assumed the singer was so mortified that she fled immediately, though later assumed the incident was a possible [...] "set up", adding it was the last time he had spoken to her. Coletti's assumption is potentially another reason for Jackson's blacklisting on MTV in addition to other music channels and radio formats. An MTV representative confirmed the costume tear was conceptualized by the MTV staff, in which the show's producers mockingly ripped their clothing in response to Timberlake's closing lyric during rehearsals. This led to Jackson and Timberlake improvising the move, in which Timberlake tore off Jackson's kilt. Frattini stated, [...] "When we did the original rehearsal, there was conversation about a fake skirt she would wear, and that Justin would actually pull open the skirt and take off the skirt. In rehearsal, they actually tried to rip open the skirt, which kind of went with the lyrics of the song". The production team then discussed another option, which led to the costume tearing, although the outfit was intended to stay in place.|$|E
