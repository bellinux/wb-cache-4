40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} an investigation which was undertaken to reveal the similarities and differences in the mechanical properties and microstructural characteristics of three Ni-Hard I alloys. One alloy (B 1) is ASTM A 532 class IA Ni-Hard containing 4. 2 wt. pct. Ni. The second alloy (B 2) is similar to B 1 but higher in Cr, Si, and Mo. The third alloy (T 1) also falls in the same ASTM specification, but it contains 3. 3 wt. pct. Ni. The alloys were evaluated in both as-cast and stress-relieved conditions except for B 2, which was evaluated in the stress-relieved condition only. While the matrix of the high Ni alloys is composed of austenite and martensite in both conditions, the matrix of the low Ni alloy consists of a considerable amount of bainite, in addition to the martensite and the retained austenite in as cast condition, and primarily bainite, with some retained austenite, in the stress relieved condition. It was found that the <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> <b>treatment</b> does not change the tensile strength of the high Ni alloy. Both the as cast and stress relieved high Ni alloys had a tensile strength of about 350 MPa. On the other hand, the tensile strength of the low Ni alloy increased from 340 MPa to 452 MPa with the <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> <b>treatment.</b> There {{was no significant difference in}} the wear resistance of these alloys in both as-cast and stressrelieved conditions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{superalloy}} of Inconel 718 {{variety is}} widely used to produce compressor blade in gas turbine engine. The blade tip invariably wears in services and thus requires frequent metallization for repairing. In most commercial Turbine Engine Industries the metallised blades, after grinding, undergo a stress relieving heat treatment at 760 0 C before return for applications. In this study, the metallised blade is heat treated at different conditions and compared its microstructure and hardness {{with those of the}} standard <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> <b>treatment</b> blades used in most industries. The microstructure of the stress relieving sample contains dendrite with hardness of 230 HV for the melt zone, 190 HV for the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) and 420 HV for the parent metal. Solutionising at 982 or 1066 0 C developed hardness less than 220 HV in all sections. By long time ageing treatment of the solutionised sample developed high hardness across the whole blade.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if common boiler failures were mainly due to uncontrollable events or from the effects from selecting lower grade materials and processes for the components. Eighteen case studies of tubing failures were selected and examined from boilers all around the world. Twelve of the tubes failed due to excess hoop stress and six failed from some kind of cracking. Calculations were made and it was determined that seventy-five percent of the failures would not have happened if a higher grade but more expensive material had been used. It was also found that 83. 3 percent of the utilities did not perform any metal treatments for the tubes that experienced cracking. Although there was no way to prove that these cracks would not have happened with some sort of <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> <b>treatment,</b> the numbers suggest this. Utilities not properly treating their metal components should carefully consider such treatment. The economizer, superheater and reheater were the boiler components selected for this study.

Ductile iron (DI) has got enormous applications in different fields such as wind turbines, automotive components, spun pipe and fittings etc. As mechanical properties are primarily dependent on the matrix structure, different heat treatments are performed to the ductile iron to achieve required matrix. Alloying additions are made to stabilize the matrix structure at all the temperatures. In the present work, investigation has been conducted on mechanical properties of Ferritic/PearliticDuctile Iron and Austenitic Ductile Iron and comparison has been made by varying different heat treatments. Here, Austenitic phase is stabilized by adding Nickel as alloying element. Stress relieving and austempering heat treatments are performed to Ferritic/Pearlitic Ductile Iron. <b>Stress</b> <b>relieving</b> <b>treatment</b> is carried out by heating the specimen to 600 ˚C, furnace cooling to 290 ˚C followed by air cooling to room temperature. Austempering treatment is carried out by heating the sample to 925 ˚C, quenching in salt solution maintained at 475 ˚C followed by air cooling to produce ausferritic matrix. Annealing treatment is done to Austenitic Ductile iron by heating the specimen to 1000 ˚C and then furnace cooled to room temperature to produce coarse grain structure. The microstructures of all the heat treated and as cast specimens are viewed under optical microscope and planes obtained for different phases are determined using X-Ray diffractometer.

40|$|The {{aircraft}} industry has long recognised {{the importance of}} climate protection {{and the benefits of}} reducing weight for the production of cost effective and fuel efficient aircraft structures. Fibre laser welding provides advantages over conventional riveting, mainly in terms of weight reduction and time saving. However, significant changes in microstructure, metallurgical state and associated mechanical properties occur in welded joints. Such changes can result in residual stresses, distortions and defects formation in the welded structure, thus significantly influencing the performance and service life. In order to maintain structural integrity of welded structures, the relationship between welding process and performance of the structure needs to be fully assessed. In this thesis, comprehensive relationships between materials, welding process, microstructure and mechanical properties of welded joints were established. Welding parameters including power density, laser power, welding speed, focal position, filler metal feed rate and shielding gas composition were optimised to produce high quality full penetration welds. Solidification cracking was found to be a critical issue in AA 2024 -T 3 when welding without filler metal. The addition of filler metal reduced its crack sensitivity but it was also necessary to provide the optimum feed rate to avoid welding defects and keyhole instability. Sufficiently high laser power and low welding speed were required for full penetration and also to minimise welding defects. Both argon and helium shielding gases were found to be effective since only weakly ionised laser induced vapour plume was formed rather than strongly ionised plasma. Softening in AA 204 -T 3 deteriorated the plastic straining capacity of the weld due to confined plasticity development within the weld. A poor weld quality resulted in a mixed mode of brittle and ductile failure and contained micro porosities and hot cracks, whereas, a good weld quality led to a ductile mode with significantly less welding defects. In the case of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, the strength was the greatest in the weld as a result of martensitic microstructure formed during fast cooling rates. Local plastic deformation was the lowest in the weld and therefore, failed in the parent material but at the cost of reduced ductility relative to the unwelded parent tensile specimens. The residual stresses and distortions due to time dependent and localised heating imposed during fibre laser welding were numerically simulated with thermal and mechanical boundary conditions integrated in the finite element models including post weld heat treatment, mechanical <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> <b>treatment</b> and various clamping arrangements. Mechanical boundary conditions had relatively small influence on residual stresses in thin sheets of butt welded specimens, whereas, greater restraints led to higher residual stresses and lower restraints led to lower residual stresses in T-joint specimens. Non-isothermal diffusional and diffusionless phase transformations in Ti- 6 Al- 4 V were modelled and their influence on residual stresses and distortions was examined. Phase transformations only had a small influence on the magnitude and distribution of residual stresses and distortions because the level of internal stresses due to phase transformation remained low unlike other materials which exhibit greater differences in the specific volumes between phases. Post weld heat treatment (PWHT) induced diffusional phase transformations via decomposition of martensite into α. It also decreased the magnitude of y stresses to the yield strength of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V at the treatment temperature by releasing the locked-in stresses. Mechanical stress relieving was also studied for reducing residual stresses and distortions, by means of plastic deformation applied during as well as after welding.

40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) processes produce {{parts with}} improved physical, chemical, and mechanical properties compared to conventional manufacturing processes. In AM processes, intricate part geometries are produced from multicomponent alloy powder, in a layer-by-layer fashion with multipass laser melting, solidification, and solid-state phase transformations, in a shorter manufacturing time, with minimal surface finishing, {{and at a}} reasonable cost. However, there is an increasing need for post-processing of the manufactured parts via, for example, <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> heat <b>treatment</b> and hot isostatic pressing to achieve homogeneous microstructure and properties at all times. Solidification in an AM process controls the size, shape, and distribution of the grains, the growth morphology, the elemental segregation and precipitation, the subsequent solid-state phase changes, and ultimately the material properties. The critical issues in this process are linked with multiphysics (such as fluid flow and diffusion of heat and mass) and multiscale (lengths, times and temperature ranges) challenges that arise due to localized rapid heating and cooling during AM processing. The alloy chemistry-process-microstructure-property-performance correlation in this process will be increasingly better understood through multiscale modeling and simulation.

40|$|Cold-drawn {{eutectoid}} steel wires {{are used in}} prestressed concrete structures to provide compressive stresses to the concrete. For that purpose, they are loaded up to 60 to 70 % of their tensile strength. Although the loading stress {{is lower than the}} elastic limit (around 85 % of the tensile strength), failure may occur in service conditions due to stress corrosion. Wire failure reduces the load bearing capacity and may lead to catastrophic collapse of the prestressed structure. The risk of these failures can be increased by the presence of tensile residual stresses {{on the surface of the}} wires. Cold-drawing generates considerable residual stresses which, added to the service stresses, may seriously affect the mechanical properties and durability of the wires [1, 2]. Until now, the measuring of residual stresses was considered more a scientific problem and even revealing their presence was a challenging task [3]. However, wire manufacturers were aware of the deleterious effect produced by the presence of tensile residual stresses at the surface of the wires after drawing. That is the reason why they consider residual stresses both dangerous and damaging, and hence attempt to reduce their influence by <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> <b>treatments.</b> But residual <b>stresses</b> may also have beneficial effects if we are able to obtain the desired profile. With the advent of powerful experimental techniques for measurement of residual stresses — such as neutron and X-ray diffractometers — and of faster computers to simulate numerically the wire drawing processes, this phenomenon is seen now in a new light. A significant research effort has been undertaken in recent years in order to understand, measure and control the residual stresses in cold-drawn wires [3 - 5]. In the first part of this paper [3], the advances on the measurement and simulation of residual stresses have been discussed. In this second part, the influence of residual stresses on the mechanical properties required by standards to this kind of wire (tensile, stress relaxation and stress corrosion tests) is reviewed. The control of residual stresses may play an important role in the design of new post-drawing treatments and the optimization of the performance of the wires...|$|R
40|$|The forming {{of parts}} with an {{optimized}} surface roughness and high dimensional accuracy {{is important in}} many applications of incremental sheet forming (ISF). To realize this, the effect of <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> heat <b>treatment</b> of grade- 1 Ti parts performed before and after forming on the surface finish and dimensional accuracy was studied. It was found that heat treatment at a temperature of 540 °C for 2 h improves the surface finish of formed parts resulting in a surface {{with little or no}} visible tool marks. Additionally, it improves the dimensional accuracy of parts after unclamping from the rig used for forming, in particular, that of parts with shallow wall angles (typically < 25 °). It was also noted that post-forming heat treatment improves the surface finish of parts. The surface topography of formed parts was studied using interferometry to yield areal surface roughness parameters and subsequently using secondary electron imaging. Back-scatter electron microscopy imaging results coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed that heat treatment prior to forming leads to tool wear as indicated by the presence of Fe in samples. Furthermore, post-forming heat treatment prevents curling up of formed parts due to compressive stresses if the formed part is trimmed...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing of {{aero engine}} {{components}} requires attention to residual stress and final {{shape of the}} product in order to meet high quality product standards. This sets very high demands on involved manufacturing steps to meet design requirements. Simulation of manufacturing processes can therefore be animportant tool to contribute to quality assurance. The focus in this work is on simulation of a manufacturing process chain comprising of sheet metal forming, welding and a stress relief heat treatment. Simulation of sheet metal forming can be used to design a forming tool design that accounts for the material behaviour, e. g. spring back, and avoid problems such as wrinkling, thinning and cracking. Moreover, the simulation can also show how the material is stretched and work hardened. The residual stresses after forming may be of local character or global depending on the shape that is formed. However, the heat affected zone due to welding is located near the weld. The weld also causes large residual stresses with the major component along the weld. It is found that the magnitude of the residual stresses after welding is affected by remaining stresses from the previous sheet metal forming. The final <b>stress</b> <b>relieve</b> <b>treatment</b> will relax these residual stresses caused by e. g. forming and welding. However, this causes additional deformations. The main focus of this study is on how a manufacturing process step affects the subsequent step when manufacturing a component of the nickel-based super alloy 718. The chosen route and geometry is a simplified leading edge of an exhaust case guide vane. The simulations were validated versus experiments. The computed deformations were compared with measurements after each manufacturing step. The overall agreement between experiments and measurement was good. However, not sufficiently accurate considering the required tolerance of the component. It was found from simulations that the residual stresses after each process affects the subsequent step. After a complete manufacturing process chain which ends with a stress relief heat treatment the residual stresses were not negligible. VIII Special experiments were performed for studying the stress relief in order to understand how the stresses evolve through the heat treatment cycle during relaxation. It was found that the stresses were reduced already during the beginning of the heating up sequence due to decreasing Young´s modulus and yield stress with increasing temperature.

(orig.) A {{detailed}} {{literature review}} {{has been carried}} out on the topic to identify the areas requiring further investigations. Based on this investigations have been carried out to evaluate the influence of dissolved nitrogen in weld metals on their toughness and strain aging behaviour through fracture mechanics as well as conventional impact testing approaches. MMA C-Mn steel weld metals bearing nitrogen between 80 to 210 ppm were investigated under four different post-weld conditions, namely: 1. as welded, 2. <b>stress</b> <b>relieved,</b> 3. artificially strain aged and 4. artificially strain aged and <b>stress</b> <b>relieved.</b> Quantitative metallography and low load microhardness studies of microphases were integral part of these investigations. The results demonstrate the highly detrimental effect of nitrogen on the toughness behaviour of C-Mn steel weld metal particularly under strain aging conditions. This is substantiated through decrease of acicular ferrite with the accompanying increase in primary ferrite and ferrite with second phases in the microstructures. Also, there is a distinctive increase in acicular ferrite microhardness. Post-weld <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> heat <b>treatment</b> under these conditions effects only marginal improvement in toughness and shifts the fracture behaviour from brittle to ductile or quasi-ductile only in the case of low nitrogen weld metals.

We investigated how acidification and nutrition affected pre-competent larval growth of the slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata during the first 8 days after hatching.

If gear fails in tensile fatigue, the results are catastrophic and occur {{with little or no}} warnings. Therefore for all the reasons mentioned above, this work is of more practical importance. For many years, gear design has been improved by using improved material, hardening surfaces with heat treatment and carburization, and shot penning to improve surface finish etc. Few more efforts have been made to improve the durability and strength by altering the pressure angle, using the asymmetric teeth, altering the geometry of root fillet curve and so on.

Additions of carbon (C), boron (B) and hafnium, (Hf) have been shown to improve casting yields in large, defect-prone components; however, their response to heat treatment is not fully understood.   A study was undertaken to evaluate three single crystal alloys for use in an industrial gas turbine (IGT). PWA 1484, CMSX- 8 (B/C) and CMSX- 486 were evaluated {{in order to understand the}} effects of the solution/homogenization anneal and the response of the historically grain boundary-strengthening, minor elements to heat treatment with the goal of reducing total heat treatment time. A heat treatment evaluation method was created utilizing optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs to measure the primary dendrite arm spacing (PDAS) and[gamma]-[gamma]’ eutectic, carbide and porosity volume fractions using ImageJ. The chemical segregation which forms from the partitioning of elements during solidification and the reduction of segregation through heat treatment was measured by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Using the results of the heat treatment analysis method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), EPMA and JMatPro, a modified solution heat treatment was designed for CMSX- 8 (B/C) which produced a smaller eutectic volume fraction (5. 76 % ± 0. 71 %) than the industrially preferred heat treatment (7. 82 % ± 0. 29 %) in one fourth of the time. CMSX- 486 was found to be incapable of solution heat treatment, and was discarded from IGT consideration. An inverse relationship was found between the decrease in volume fraction of primary carbides caused by dissolution and the volume fraction of porosity increase during heat treatment of CMSX- 8 (B/C) and PWA 1484. A strain-assisted carbide dissolution mechanism was proposed resultingin an increase in solidus suppressing solute species. Localized melting occurred throughout homogenization heat treatments resulting in porosity generation and was attributed to the increase in solute concentrations. A pre-solution anneal stress-relieving heat treatment was designed which reduced the porosity generation in PWA 1484 by 41. 1 %, over a similar solution annealed microstructure without a <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> heat <b>treatment...</b>|$|R

In this paper, results of fracture toughness testing performed on manual metal arc weld metal in the as-welded and <b>stress</b> <b>relieved</b> conditions are compared. Tests were performed on standard 25 mm thick compact tension specimens machined from nominally 100 mm thick weldments manufactured using basic coated Fortrex 35 A consumables and C-Mn steel parent plate. The baseline for the dependence of fracture toughness on temperature was established by performing tests on <b>stress</b> <b>relieved</b> weld metal as a function of temperature. A comparison between the fracture toughness of as-welded and <b>stress</b> <b>relieved</b> weld metals was made by testing specimens from the same weld at 200 °C. To assess the temperature dependence of as-welded weld metal, further tests were performed at 300 ºC...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{reduction}} of contact stresses of the spur gear and pinion used in headstock of a lathe machine by introducing <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> feature of different shapes i. e. circular hole, elliptical hole and aero fin hole. In this paper the stress analysis of mating gears of the spur gear with three different materials is done to determine the contact stresses generated in the gear teeth. In the previous paper the results obtained from Finite Element Analysis (FEA) using Ansys are compared with the values obtained from theoretical Hertzian equation. The materials of spur gear used for analysis are grey cast iron, high carbon steel and medium carbon steel. In this paper the stresses which were calculated has been reduced by introducing <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> feature of different shapes. It was found that <b>Stress</b> <b>relieving</b> feature having the shape of aero- fin yielded better results when compared to elliptical and circular holes. KEYWORDS:...|$|R
