50|$|Newborn parenting, {{is where}} the {{responsibilities}} of parenthood begins. A newborn's basic needs are food, sleep, comfort and cleaning which the parent provides. An infant's only form of communication is crying, and attentive parents will begin to recognize different types of crying which represent different needs such as hunger, discomfort, boredom, or loneliness. Newborns and young infants require feedings every few hours which is disruptive to adult sleep cycles. They respond enthusiastically to soft stroking, cuddling and caressing. Gentle {{rocking back and forth}} often calms a crying infant, as do massages and warm baths. Newborns may comfort themselves by sucking their thumb or a pacifier. The need to suckle is instinctive and allows newborns to feed. Breastfeeding is the recommended method of feeding by all major infant health organizations. If breastfeeding is not possible or desired, bottle feeding is a common alternative. Other alternatives include feeding breastmilk or formula with a cup, <b>spoon,</b> <b>feeding</b> syringe, or nursing supplementer.|$|E

40|$|Since 2002, {{the minimum}} {{recommended}} age worldwide for {{the introduction of}} solid foods has been six months, an age when most infants are able to bring food to their mouth and chew it, without assistance. Despite this, the practice of <b>spoon</b> <b>feeding</b> with purées remains prevalent and most research to date has examined the introduction of solid foods from the adult’s perspective rather than the infant’s. As a result, factors that may impact on the food preferences of infants, such as the appearance, smell and haptic qualities of food, have not been investigated, nor has the routine use of puréed foods been challenged. Similarly, while differences have been well documented between the processes of breastfeeding and bottle feeding, {{the possibility that there}} may be pertinent differences between <b>spoon</b> <b>feeding</b> and self-feeding has not been explored. Overall, the introduction of solid foods has been researched in nutritional terms, rather than in relation to the infant’s experience and his wider learning and development.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 37 - 44) During {{the past}} few years, attention {{has been focused on}} the aged and their nutritional problems. The public has begun to realize that the elderly have needs and desires comparable to those of other age groups. Researchers and others in the field of gerontology are discovering that many elderly people have physiological as well as emotional problems that accelerate the aging process. A portion of the elderly population is forced to spend their lives in nursing homes due to these problems. Nursing care facilities have a responsibility to try and satisfy the needs of their residents, including the assurance that they are nutritionally satisfied. The dietitians and food service workers employed by nursing care facilities must realize that patients are individuals with varying food preferences and that, through proper menu planning and flexibility, it is possible to meet their dietary needs. The criteria used to measure the factors contributing to plate waste were as follows: First, each patient participating in the study was asked to fill out a questionnaire regarding preference for the foods listed. This information was then analyzed and compared with the amount of food left after each of the fourteen meals observed. Each patient was also interviewed to determine the reason for not consuming the food served. The study demonstrated that the major cause for plate waste was that the patient did not like the food served. It further showed that, aside from food dislikes, a number of other factors contributed to plate waste. Some of these were: a change in eating patterns, inappropriate temperature of food, lack of appetite, appearance of food and tray, food portion size, edentulous problems, a dislike of <b>spoon</b> <b>feeding,</b> improperly cooked food, and satiety...|$|E
40|$|To The Editor: Having read Dr Benamer’s {{views on}} medical teaching, we remembered our days as medical {{students}} [1]. We share Dr Benamer’s and other’s views that teaching in Libyan medical schools should shift from being subject focused to being learning focused [1, 2]. We remember one incident when our professor showed us an ECG and {{asked about the}} diagnosis. He was so furious when none of us {{was able to make}} the diagnosis {{to the extent that he}} left the lecture room without completing the teaching session. This is just one example among many that illustrates the lack of teaching skills so common in our medical institutions and the poor state of the Teacher-Student relationship. Therefore, it is not surprising that many students prefer not to attend lectures. In our view and from our experience, the formats of the lectures were organised around information designed for students to be memorised rather than learnt (<b>spoon</b> <b>feeding)</b> Which is one of the reasons why many students have found the teaching sessions simply boring and useless. In their attempts to overcome this problem, students tried to find ways to learn; acquiring knowledge through the organisation of discussion groups and seeking the help of senior students when necessary. These discussion groups mimic what has been recently introduced as Problem Based Learning (PBL) [3]. Even though these discussion groups may have lacked direction, they were perceived to be an important factor in the success of many students. Given the poor attendance rates to the lectures, the teachers failed to investigate the reasons behind this and take proactive steps to correct the problem. Because of the lack of teacher analysis and reflection it comes as no surprise that the format and quality of teaching has continued along the same traditional lines with the same problems being continually encountered. The point here is that many of these students went on to become highly successful physicians and surgeons in their working life amongst more modern teaching systems and approaches in the west. So it is logical to conclude that should the methods of teaching and teaching skills improve, the success rate among final year medical students will undoubtedly follow suit. It is our recommendation that in order to improve the success rate amongst students, a more modern way of teaching is urgently required [3]. Teachers first need to recognise that problems exist, and then act proactively to address them [4]. One way is the provision of ‘Train The Trainer’ and other similar courses to increase teaching skills, coupled with more discussion groups, clinical clerks, case presentations, increased student involvement during medical rounds and within lectures, and increased attendance at common procedures. All of the above will surely result in increasing the success rate beyond the current 50 % passing rate for final year students...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to advance {{understanding}} of self-directed learning characteristics of first-year, first-generation college students participating in a summer bridge program. Understanding the experience of these students in higher education can lead to the development of programmatic and pedagogical strategies to better meet the needs of this at-risk student population. This study was conducted at the University of South Florida (USF), a large, public research university in Tampa. Participants were recruited from the Freshman Summer Institute (FSI), a summer bridge program for first-generation students at USF. Theoretical frameworks from higher education and adult education literature merged to provide an understanding of self-direction for the context of this study. Student retention and social integration theories from Tinto and Astin were studied, as they have been widely used to assist higher education professionals in understanding the reasons students leave college and to assist administrators in the development of strategies and programs to aid in the retention of at-risk students. An example of a retention strategy is the summer bridge program, used by a variety of colleges and universities to increase persistence of at-risk student populations. The adult education theory of self-directed learning complemented Tinto and Astin 2 ̆ 7 s theories. The Personal Responsibility Orientation (PRO) Model (Brockett 2 ̆ 6 Hiemstra, 1991) served as a theoretical framework for understanding self-direction among the participants in the study. The PRO Model posits that learners utilize personal responsibility through the characteristics of the teaching-learning transaction along with their own personal learning characteristics to achieve self-directed learning within a broader social context. The Personal Responsibility Orientation to Self-Direction in Learning Scale (PRO- SDLS), based on a conceptualization of the PRO Model, was used to quantitatively measure self-directed learning among participation in the FSI Program. A series of correlations, dependent means t-tests, and factorial ANOVA 2 ̆ 7 s were conducted to examine the relationship between scores on both pre-test and post-test administrations of the PRO-SDLS. In addition to an investigation of the change in self-direction, relationships between academic achievement, gender, and ethnicity was also examined in the study. Measured increases in overall self-directedness as measured by the pre-test and post-test administrations of the PRO-SDLS were not considered statistically significant, however, significant correlational relationships (p 3 ̆c. 01) were found between academic achievement and total PRO-SDLS scores. Subcomponent measurements of learner control and self-efficacy were also highly correlated to both admissions GPA and university GPA. No significant relationships were found between ethnicity, gender and scores on the PRO-SDLS. An implication for practice indicates that a shift in teaching pedagogy may be an integral component to increasing the academic success of first-year college students. Higher education faculty should be challenged to design curriculum that relies less on rote memorization and 2 ̆ 2 <b>spoon</b> <b>feeding</b> 2 ̆ 2 information to students. Instead, a learner-centered curriculum which gives control of the learning process to students is vital to instilling the habits of highly self-directed learners. In addition to revamped pedagogical strategies, this study calls for the development of national benchmarks and guidelines to more effectively evaluate the quality and impact of summer bridge programs...|$|E
50|$|Pretense with dolls {{begins when}} a child extends pretend self actions to a doll. A child might start by pretending to feed themselves, then reach out and pretend to be feeding a doll. This is further {{developed}} {{when a child}} begins giving the doll an active role rather than a passive one. For example, the doll doesn't just eat when fed by the child, instead the child pretends that the doll reaches for the <b>spoon</b> and <b>feeds</b> itself. After the doll is given an active role, the child begins to bestow upon it sensory and emotional attributes, such as feeling sad, happy, or hurt. The highest form of doll play appears {{when a child is}} about 3 {{and a half years of}} age. At this point, the child is capable of giving the doll cognitive abilities.|$|R
50|$|The first Baby Alive doll was {{introduced}} by Kenner in 1973. It could be fed food packets mixed with water, and came with a bottle, diapers, and <b>feeding</b> <b>spoon.</b> The spoon would be inserted into its mouth, and a lever on its back pushed to have it chew the food. The food would move through her and end up in her diaper; this version did not speak, {{so you had to}} check the diaper a few moments after feeding. It also produced droppings and threw up regularly.|$|R

But I confess I don't see why {{our young}} friend, in his degree, should {{not seek to}} invest himself with such poetry as is open to him. He is no doubt born with an appetite--probably, when {{he is in a}} safer state of health, he has an {{excellent}} appetite. Very well. At our young friend's natural dinner hour, most likely about noon, our young friend says in effect to society, 'I am hungry; will you have the goodness to produce your <b>spoon</b> and <b>feed</b> me?' Society, which has taken upon itself the general arrangement of the whole system of spoons and professes to have a spoon for our young friend, does NOT produce that spoon; and our young friend, therefore, says 'You really must excuse me if I seize it.' Now, this appears to me a case of misdirected energy, which has a certain amount of reason in it and a certain amount of romance; and I don't know but what I should be more interested in our young friend, as an illustration of such a case, than merely as a poor vagabond--which any one can be." ...|$|R
