50|$|During the Apollo 13 emergency, U.S. {{contractor}} Grumman Aerospace Corp., which {{built the}} lunar module for NASA, asked the University of Toronto for help specifically {{in how to}} jettison the lunar module just prior to re-entry. A team of six engineers at the university was formed - led by Etkin as the senior scientist - {{to solve the problem}} in one day using nothing more than slide rules and collective expertize. (Besides Etkin, the team also consisted of Rod Tennyson, Barry French, Philip Sullivan, Peter Hughes, a specialist in orbital mechanics, and another senior scientist, Irvine Glass, a specialist in shock waves.) Given that a small tunnel connected the lunar module to the command module, the team concluded that if they closed the tunnel hatch and pressurized the tunnel, the astronauts could explosively separate the lunar module and blow it away from the command module just prior to re-entry. The scientists had 6 hours to compute the pressure required using <b>slide-rules.</b> They needed a precise calculation as too high a pressure might damage the hatch and its seal causing the astronauts to burn up; too low, and the lunar module would not separate from the command module. The resulting calculation was relayed by Grumman to NASA, and from there to the astronauts who implemented the solution.|$|E

Imagine a large hall like a theatre, except that the circles and {{galleries}} go right round through the space usually occupied by the stage. The walls of this chamber are painted to form {{a map of the}} globe. The ceiling represents the north polar regions, England is in the gallery, the tropics in the upper circle, Australia on the dress circle and the Antarctic in the pit.A myriad computers are at work upon the weather of the part of the map where each sits, but each computer attends only to one equation or part of an equation. The work of each region is coordinated by an official of higher rank. Numerous little [...] "night signs" [...] display the instantaneous values so that neighbouring computers can read them. Each number is thus displayed in three adjacent zones so as to maintain communication to the North and South on the map.From the floor of the pit a tall pillar rises to half the height of the hall.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} held that what distinguishes modern mathematics is {{the availability of}} highspeed electronic computers and pocket calculators with graphical capabilities. Consequently, mathematics is usually taught in schools and undergraduate courses as if Euler and Gauss were our contemporaries, with electronic gadgets replacing tables, <b>slide-rules</b> and sketching. We discuss cultural changes in mathematics {{over the past two}} hundred years overlooked by such an approach, specifically the rise of rigour and algebra. These have altered the face of mathematics, providing a deeper understanding of many important results, by providing a unified, coherent setting. At the same time, these developments have increased the power and scope of mathematics, by enabling it to deal with non-quantitative problems, by making many computations accessible to computers and by making it more applicable to other disciplines. We use, in particular, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus as an illustration and offer a programme for teaching calculus in a manner which accommodates these developments and eases the student’s path to further studies. 1 Backgroun...|$|E
50|$|Lt. Philip Dalton (April 1, 1903 - July 25, 1941) was a United States {{military}} scientist, {{pilot and}} engineer. Dalton {{is best known}} for his invention of several <b>slide-rule</b> analog flight computers, the most famous being the E6B.|$|R

50|$|With {{the advent}} of the electronic, {{transistorized}} calculator in the 1970s, slide rules became obsolete for most uses. Slide rules had never been very profitable for K & E, so it was not difficult to discontinue the line. K & E's market share shrank because of other technological advancements, and the firm shut down its <b>slide-rule</b> engraving machines in 1975.|$|R

5000|$|The ASTE crest shows {{a futuristic}} {{aircraft}} carrying guided weapons ringed by an ellipse. A <b>slide-rule</b> is superimposed on the fuselage {{of the aircraft}} The <b>slide-rule</b> portrays precision and accuracy needed during flight-testing. It also signifies the aspects of technical knowledge and training involved in producing test pilots and test engineers. The missiles represent armament that forms the major preoccupation of ASTE as a defence services establishment. The ring portrays significant aspects {{of the role of}} ASTE. First of all, it depicts the sighting ring of a gun sight, which symbolises not only the involvement of ASTE with armament, but also its concern for constant vigil on correct aims and objectives. Secondly, it symbolises the aiming circles provided on the ground targets as seen from the air and signifies the need for accuracy of results to be obtained during flight testing. The crest also symbolises the aspirations and ambitions of ASTE in involving itself with the country's future plans in the realm of aerospace, The words 'Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment' and 'Indian Air Force' are inscribed on the roundel in a light blue background. The 'Ashok Stambh' heads the crest and laurel leaves surround the crest.

50|$|To {{aid in the}} {{necessary}} calculations, it was common to use a simple mechanical calculator that combined a <b>slide-rule</b> like calculator on one side with a vector calculator on the other. The best-known modern example is the E6B, which remains a basic part of every pilot and navigator's toolkit. Using the vector calculator and basic measurements, one can easily calculate the winds aloft and then the course made good. These calculations are identical to those needed to properly account {{for the effects of}} winds on the bombing approach. The problem was that these calculations were complex, time consuming and error prone.|$|R

40|$|Twentyfive {{years ago}} when I studied Physics, {{only one of the}} {{students}} who participated in a laboratory course that I took was possessing one of the first calculators to process the data we were obtaining.

50|$|The {{draw for}} the quarter-finals and semi-finals {{took place in}} Nyon, Switzerland, on 16 March. Milan were paired with Barcelona, whom they already met in the group stage, and should they {{progress}} they would face {{the winners of the}} quarter-final between Benfica and Chelsea The first leg against Barcelona was played at the San Siro on Wednesday, 28 March. Milan started the game pressing the holders high up the pitch and on three minutes Barcelona lost the ball just outside their own area, allowing Kevin-Prince Boateng to unleash a shot that looped into the path of Zlatan Ibrahimović. The striker headed the ball to the unmarked Robinho, who volleyed it over the bar from eight meters. Barcelona reaction came not long after, as on ten minutes Milan goalkeeper Christian Abbiati fumbled Lionel Messi's scuffed shot and Dani Alves proded wide from close range. Abbiati denied Xavi after a quick one-two with Messi, while Alessandro Nesta and Luca Antonini made crucial interventions. However, Milan could have scored on 20 minutes when Clarence Seedorf's <b>slide-rule</b> pass left Ibrahimović with only goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to beat, but the Swede's scuffed shot was saved. In the second half, Massimiliano Allegri brought on Stephan El Shaarawy for Robinho to inject more pace into the hosts' play. Soon, though, the visitors retook control of the match and Nesta had to foul Messi to prevent him from snaking into the area; the Argentinian forward curled the resulting free-kick over the bar. Pep Guardiola replaced Andrés Iniesta with Cristian Tello, who sent a shot wide on 73 minutes. Moments later, Carles Puyol glanced Xavi's corner narrowly wide of goal. The Rossoneri continued to resist with Daniele Bonera twice making timely tackles on Messi, Ambrosini deflecting the same player's goal-bound shot wide and Antonini denying Tello from close range after a save by Abbiati, and the game eventually ended in a scoreless draw.|$|R
25|$|Manchester United went to Wigan on {{the final}} day of the season, knowing that they needed only to equal or better Chelsea's result against Bolton in order to be Premier League champions, due to their {{superior}} goal difference. Wayne Rooney was named in the United starting lineup despite concerns over his fitness, while Nemanja Vidić made a return to the side for the first time since his concussion against Chelsea. Wigan started the game with an aggressive mentality, closing down the United players at every opportunity. Paul Scholes was booked early on for a tackle from behind on Wilson Palacios, but the Latics then had a penalty shout turned down in the 24th minute, when a Jason Koumas shot appeared to deflect off Rio Ferdinand's outstretched upper arm. Wigan's anguish was then compounded when referee Steve Bennett awarded United a penalty for Emmerson Boyce's foul on Wayne Rooney. Cristiano Ronaldo stepped up to take the penalty, which he converted, equalling Alan Shearer's record for the most goals in a 38-game season with 31 goals. Soon after, Scholes was fortunate not to be sent off when he cynically brought down Wilson Palacios. Fortunately for Scholes, Steve Bennett chose to keep his cards in his pocket. In the second half, United continued to test the Wigan goal, but goalkeeper Chris Kirkland was up to the task, producing a number of good saves. Paul Scholes was brought down in the box by Titus Bramble early in the half, but the referee was not positioned well enough to be able to give it. With 25 minutes to go, Alex Ferguson brought on Owen Hargreaves to shore up the defence, and Ryan Giggs, who equalled Bobby Charlton's club appearance record with his 758th appearance in a United shirt. Fittingly, it was Giggs who got United's second goal of the game, slotting the ball past Kirkland after Wayne Rooney played him in with a <b>slide-rule</b> pass. A last-minute equaliser by Bolton against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge ensured that United's championship did not have to be decided by goal difference, and it left the Red Devils as the champions of England for the 17th time, just one short of Liverpool's record of 18 titles.|$|R
