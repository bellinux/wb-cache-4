It has very potent neurotoxic venom which it uses to prey on eels and small fish. Because of their affinity to land, banded sea kraits often encounter humans, but the snakes are not aggressive and only attack in self-defense.|$|E

5|$|The show's puppeteers claim {{there are}} {{different}} problems working with different characters. For example, Destiny is the largest puppet and so moving her is more difficult. As Marion <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> of his time {{sitting on top of}} a rubbish bin, his puppeteer, Brownlow-Pike, has to stand inside a bottomless bin for long periods of time. Kali {{is said to be the}} most difficult puppet to work with, because as she has no hands she is limited to what she can hold.|$|E
5|$|Amy rescues Sonic from {{imprisonment}} {{and asks}} him {{to marry her}} but yet again Sonic refuses to in Sonic Adventure 2. When she looks for Sonic (to save him again), she finds Shadow the Hedgehog after mistaking him for Sonic. Eggman attacks her with his mecha and Tails defends her; she then <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> of the remaining game searching for Chaos Emeralds with Tails and Knuckles. At the game's climax, Amy pleads with Shadow to help her and the other characters neutralize a catastrophic energy buildup at the space colony ARK. She reminds him of Maria Robotnik, his friend on the ARK before her death, and he agrees to help.|$|E
5|$|Fairly {{inactive}} in nature, the Japanese sleeper ray <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> of {{its time}} lying buried on the sea floor. It can produce an electric shock of 30–80 volts to ward off predators, which include the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). Its electric organs are composed of electrocytes, which are specialized cells derived from muscle fibers that are filled with a jelly-like substance. These electrocytes are stacked in vertical columns, with many columns making up each electric organ; this arrangement functions essentially like batteries connected in parallel. The diet of the Japanese sleeper ray includes benthic invertebrates. A parasite of this species is the tapeworm Anteropora japonica (Yamaguti, 1934) Subhapradha, 1955.|$|E

5|$|The Cape sparrow is social, {{lives in}} flocks, and usually breeds in colonies. Away from settled areas it <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> {{of the year}} {{wandering}} nomadically, in flocks of up to 200 birds. In cultivated and built up areas, smaller flocks form where food is provided for livestock or birds. In such places, it associates with other seed-eating birds, such as the house sparrow, the Cape weaver, and weavers of the genus Euplectes. Birds from urban areas form large flocks seasonally and fly out to the nearby countryside to feed on ripening grain, returning at night to roost.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> of {{its time}} climbing trees, and has adaptations to this lifestyle, {{many of which are}} shared by other woodpecker species. These include the zygodactyl arrangement of the foot, with two toes facing forward and two back, and the stiff tail feathers that are used as a prop against the trunk. In most birds the bones of the tail diminish in size towards its end, but this does not occur in woodpeckers, and the final vertebra, the pygostyle, is very large to anchor the strong tail muscles.|$|E
5|$|The train {{carrying}} {{the women and}} children is accidentally redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribes Rudolf Höss, the commandant of Auschwitz, with a bag of diamonds to win their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the factory floor and encourages the Jews to observe the Jewish Sabbath. Over the next seven months, he <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> of his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies; due to Schindler's own machinations, the factory does not produce any usable armaments during this period. Schindler runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders, ending the war in Europe.|$|E

5|$|The willie wagtail is insectivorous and <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> time chasing prey in open habitat. Its {{common name}} {{is derived from}} its habit of wagging its tail {{horizontally}} when foraging on the ground. Aggressive and territorial, the willie wagtail will often harass much larger birds such as the laughing kookaburra and wedge-tailed eagle. It has responded well to human alteration of the landscape and is a common sight in urban lawns, parks, and gardens. It was widely featured in Aboriginal folklore around the country as either a bringer of bad news or a stealer of secrets.|$|E
5|$|After {{the hostage}} {{exchange}} is agreed, Troilus suggests elopement, but Cressida argues {{that he should}} not abandon Troy and that she should protect her honour. Instead, she promises to meet him within ten days. Troilus <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> of the intervening time on the city walls, sighing in the direction where Cressida has gone. No horses or sleeves, as used by Guido or Benoît, are involved in Troilus' learning of Cressida's change of heart. Instead a dream hints at what has happened, and then the truth is confirmed when a brooch – previously a gift from Troilus to Cressida – is found on Diomedes' looted clothing. In the mean time, Cressida has kept up the pretence in their correspondence that she still loves Troilus. After Cressida's betrayal is confirmed, Troilus becomes ever fiercer in battle.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the tree frog family, the green and golden bell frog <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> time basking in the sun on vegetation, rocks, and reeds, usually near water, or hopping around between such places. Unlike most frog species, it is often active during the day. When handled, this species secretes a slimy acrid mucus, which {{consists}} of 17 aurein peptides. Thirteen of these show broad-spectrum antibiotic and anticancer activity. The secretion makes the frog slippery and hard to grip, and is poisonous to some other species of frogs, so it is a useful defensive tool for green and golden bell frogs. Males often fight one another if they come within 1 m of each other, frequently leading to injuries.|$|E

5|$|As {{the film}} opens a black Ferrari circles on a race {{track in the}} desert, its engine roaring {{in and out of}} the shot. When it {{eventually}} stops, Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) steps out. Marco is a Hollywood actor who, despite his recent rise to fame, does not feel much meaning in his daily life. He resides at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles from where he completes various publicity obligations for his new film: he is photographed with his co-star (Michelle Monaghan), gives interviews to the press, and attends an award ceremony in Italy. Despite drinking and socializing occasionally with Sammy (Chris Pontius), a fellow actor and childhood friend, Marco <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> time alone, driving his Ferrari motorcar, drinking beer, taking pills, and having casual sex with various women. Twice he has pole-dancing twins (Kristina and Karissa Shannon) set up their equipment and perform in his room, the first time he falls asleep and the second routine is more calisthenic than erotic.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins lead solitary existences when {{out at sea}} {{and this}} part of their life has been little studied as the task of finding even one bird on the vast ocean is formidable. When at sea, the Atlantic puffin bobs about like a cork, {{propelling}} itself through the water with powerful thrusts of its feet and keeping itself turned into the wind, even when resting and apparently asleep. It <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> time each day preening to keep its plumage in order and spread oil from the preen gland. Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation. In common with other seabirds, its upper surface is black and underside white. This provides camouflage, with aerial predators unable to observe the bird against the dark watery background and underwater attackers failing to notice it as it blends in with the bright sky above the waves.|$|E
5|$|Best {{known for}} biting neat round chunks of tissue from marine mammals and large fish, the cookiecutter shark is {{considered}} a facultative ectoparasite, as it also wholly ingests smaller prey. It has a wide gape and a very strong bite, by virtue of heavily calcified cranial and labial cartilages. With small fins and weak muscles, this ambush predator <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> of its time hovering in the water column. To maintain neutral buoyancy, its liver, which can comprise some 35% of its weight, is rich in low-density lipids. As this species has higher skeletal density than Euprotomicrus or Squaliolus, its body cavity and liver are proportionately much larger, and the oil content is much higher. Its large caudal fin allows for a quick burst of speed to catch larger, faster prey that come in range.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{penultimate}} novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background, using a fictional obituary, purportedly from The Times. The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas and Sean Connery's depiction of Bond affected Fleming's interpretation of the character. The novel reveals Bond is the son of a Scottish father, Andrew Bond, of Glencoe, and a Swiss mother, Monique Delacroix, of the Canton de Vaud. The young James Bond <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> of his early life abroad, becoming multilingual in German and French because of his father's work as a Vickers armaments company representative. Bond is orphaned at the age of 11 when his parents are killed in a mountain climbing accident in the Aiguilles Rouges near Chamonix.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and slow-moving, the marbled {{electric}} ray may remain motionless for several days at a time. It is more active at night and <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> of the day buried in sediment with only the eyes and spiracles showing. Consistent with its sluggish nature, the marbled {{electric ray}} has a low blood oxygen carrying capacity and heart rate (10–15 beats/min), and consumes less oxygen than other sharks and rays of similar size. It is highly tolerant of being deprived of oxygen (hypoxia), allowing it to cope with deoxygenated bottom waters or being stranded in small pools by the falling tide. The ray stops breathing entirely when the oxygen partial pressure in the water drops below 10–15 Torr, and can survive such a state {{for at least five}} hours. It deals with extreme hypoxia by coupling anaerobic glycolysis to additional energy-producing pathways in its mitochondria, which serves to slow down the accumulation of potentially harmful lactate within its cells.|$|E
5|$|Students explore broad {{learning}} themes at {{each level}} {{that allow them to}} learn across subjects and engage them in creative and collaborative projects. The second group, for example, <b>spends</b> <b>much</b> of their year on the study of trees, using trees as a focus for biology, mathematics, art, and creative writing. Students adopt and study a personal space in the nearby forest preserve. The year culminates with the tapping of maple trees to make syrup, which they share {{with the rest of the}} school. Each group engages different themes and group projects. Lower school students simulate an airplane flight to Paris and host a Japanese luncheon. The fourth group holds a Native American Fair, the fifth group creates an original Egyptian style mastaba, the sixth group presents a World's Fair, and the eighth group organizes an Immigration and Ethnic Fair.|$|E
