40|$|The {{grinding}} {{power is}} often used as a parameter for monitoring the grinding process. The power may {{also be used to}} monitor the effects of dressing. Empirical models are required to guide the selection of the dressing <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> conditions. In this paper, the effects of dressing conditions <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> conditions on <b>grinding</b> force <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> power are reviewed. The effects of <b>grinding</b> conditions <b>and</b> dressing conditions on <b>grinding</b> force <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> power are related to the shape of the idealized chip thickness. It is found that the <b>grinding</b> force <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> power can be related to the dressing operation by considering the effective density of the cutting edges on the wheel surface. The semi-empirical model developed in this paper can be used to predict the variation of the grinding power during the wheel redress life cycle. Therefore the model can be used to guide the selection of dressing <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> conditions. The potential use of the model for adaptive control of the grinding process is also described...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Engineering {{ceramics}} {{have been}} widely used in recent years because of its excellent performances. However, the high hardness and brittleness make it very difficult to process with high efficiency and good quality, especially in precision and ultraprecision machining. Therefore, a method of ultrasonic drilling <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> is provided to the hole machining of Al 2 O 3 engineering ceramics. In the paper, with different machining parameters, the surface roughness of micro hole in ultrasonic and traditional drilling <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> is compared <b>and</b> analyzed. Moreover, the surface micro profile and the wear condition of drilling-grinding tool in ultrasonic and traditional drilling <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> are observed through SEM. Finally, it is concluded that ultrasonic drilling <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> is a kind of high efficient processing method adapting to micro holes of hard- brittle materials etc...|$|R

However, many quantitative methods classes teach sampling <b>and</b> <b>sub-sampling</b> at a very abstract level despite the fact that, with the faster computers of today, these notions could be demonstrated live to the students. For this reason, we have created a simple extension module for SPSS that can <b>sub-sample</b> <b>and</b> Bootstrap data, GSD (Generator of Sub-sampled Data). In this paper, we describe and show how to use the GSD module as well as provide short descriptions of both the <b>sub-sampling</b> <b>and</b> Bootstrap methods. In addition, as this article aims to inspire instructors to introduce these concepts in their statistics classes of all levels, we provide three short exercises that are ready for curriculum implementation...|$|R

Intelligent wheels will utilize re-useable cores integrated with sensors: to measure the acoustic emission (AE) <b>and</b> <b>grinding</b> force. Signals from the sensors will be transmitted from a rotating wheel to a receiver by telemetry. Wheels will be trained to recognize distinct characteristics associated with truing, dressing <b>and</b> <b>grinding.</b> The technical progress is summarized in this report...|$|R
