5000|$|Pudendal {{anesthesia}}, {{also known}} as a pudendal block, or <b>saddle</b> <b>block,</b> is a form of local anesthesia commonly used in the practice of obstetrics to relieve pain during the delivery of baby by forceps. The pudendal nerve block prevents fainting during forceps delivery which was common before pudendal nerve block use was available. The anesthesia is produced by blocking the pudendal nerves near the ischial spine of the pelvis. [...] The ischial spine separates the greater and lesser sciatic foramina at the exit of the bony pelvis. Pelvis in Latin means 'saucepan' and one can view the bony human pelvis as a saucepan, with circular/cylidrical walls, but without a base and a flailed upper rim, or wings to which the gluteal muscles (hip bone stabilisers) attach. The pelvic bony cylindrical walls also have a curve, which follows that of the curve of the sacrum, the fused vertebral bones of {{the lower end of the}} spine.|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} effects of intratracheal general {{anesthesia}} (ITGA) and regional (<b>saddle</b> <b>block)</b> anesthesia on leptin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and cortisol blood concentrations during anorectal surgery. Methods: Fifty-eight patients suffering from hemorrhoidal disease, pilonidal sinus, anal fissure, or anal fistula were included the study. Patients were randomly assigned {{into one of the}} two groups (n[*]=[*] 29). Patients in one group received ITGA. After thiopental and fentanyl induction, vecuronium was used as a muscle relaxant. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. In the other group we applied <b>saddle</b> <b>block,</b> injecting hyperbaric bupivacaine into the subarachnoid space, through the L 3 -L 4 intervertebral space, in the sitting position. Blood samples were collected for leptin, CRP, and cortisol analysis before the induction of anesthesia at 3 and 24 hours postoperatively. Results: Preoperative leptin, CRP, and cortisol concentrations were comparable between the groups. There {{was no significant difference in}} postoperative levels of leptin and CRP in both groups. Although not significant, leptin and CRP concentrations were lower in the <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> group at three hours postoperatively (mean[*]±[*]SD, 6. 95 [*]±[*] 8. 59 and 6. 02 [*]±[*] 12. 25, respectively) than in the ITGA group (mean[*]±[*]SD, 9. 04 [*]±[*] 9. 89 and 8. 40 [*]±[*] 15. 75, respectively). During early postoperative period, cortisol increased slightly in the ITGA group and remained at similar level in the <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> group, but later decreased in both groups. Cortisol levels in the <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> group were significantly lower than in the ITGA group at 3 hours postoperatively (343. 7 [*]±[*] 329. 6 vs 611. 4 [*]±[*] 569. 8; P[*]=[*] 0. 034).

40|$|Background: Spinal {{anesthesia}} is {{the technique}} of choice in transurethral resection of prostate (TURP). The major complication of spinal technique is risk of hypotension. <b>Saddle</b> <b>block</b> paralyzed pelvic muscles and sacral nerve roots and hemodynamic derangement is less. Aims and objectives: To compare the hemodynamic changes and adequate surgical condition between <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> and subarachnoid block for TURP. Material and methods: Ninety patients of aged between 50 to 70 years of ASA-PS I, II scheduled for TURP were randomly allocated into 2 groups of 45 in each group. Group A patients were received spinal (2 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine) and Group B were received <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> (2 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine). Baseline systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation were recorded and measured subsequently. The height of block was noted in both groups. Hypotension was corrected by administration of phenylephrine 50 mcg bolus and total requirement of vasopressor was noted. Complications (volume overload, TURP syndrome etc.) were noted. Results: Incidence of hypotension and vasopressor requirement was less (P < 0. 01) in Gr B patients. Adequate surgical condition was achieved in both groups. There was no incidence of volume overload, TURP syndrome, and bladder perforation. Conclusion: TURP can be safely performed under <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> without hypotension and less vasopressor requirement...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Regional (<b>saddle</b> <b>block)</b> {{anaesthesia}} in anorectal {{and some}} urological and gynaecological procedures provides suitable {{conditions for the}} surgeon due to the sufficiency of analgesia and decreases {{the side effects of}} spinal anaesthesia. In this study, duration of the painless period and complications after <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> with Meperidine (pethidine) were assessed in perineal surgeries. Materials and Methods:This study was conducted on 50 cases observed by the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class I, II(21 - 70 years old patients), who were scheduled to undergo anorectal surgery. All patients received 500 ml of crystalloid solution. The <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> was done with 30 mg pethidine and sub arachnoid puncture was performed with the patient in the sitting position. Vital signs were recorded 5 minutes before the block and at the 5 th, 10 th, 15 th and 60 th minutes after the block. The severity of postoperative pain was assessed by a visual analog scale. The data was analyzed by appropriate descriptive statistical methods. Results: The mean period of analgesia was more than 24 hours in 18 % of the patients. The VAS pain score showed no pain in 78 % of the patients. Sixteen percent of the patients complained of itching in the nose, face and chest, ten minutes after injection and it continued for about two hours. Conclusions: This study showed that the haemodynamic stability and quality of postoperative analgesia with pethidine was good, without any need for additional analgesia. We suggested using low dosage pethidine (30 mg) as <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> for perineal and anorectal surgeries...|$|E
40|$|Conventional spinal <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> is {{performed}} with the patient in a sitting position, keeping the patient sitting for between 3 to 10 min after injection of a drug. This amount of time, however, is long enough to cause prolonged postoperative urinary retention. The trend in this block is to lower the dose of local anesthetics, providing a selective segmental block; however, an optimal dose and method are needed for adequate anesthesia in variable situations. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated {{the question of whether}} only 1 min of sitting after drug injection would be sufficient and safe for minor anorectal surgery. Methods: Two hundred and sixteen patients undergoing minor anorectal surgery under spinal anesthesia remained sitting for 1 min after completion of subarachnoid administration of 1 ml of a 0. 5 % hyperbaric bupivacaine solution (5 mg). They were then placed in the jack-knife position. After surgery, analgesia levels were assessed using loss of cold sensation in the supine position. The next day, urination and 11 -point numeric rating scale (NRS) for postoperative pain were assessed. Results: None of the patients required additional analgesics during surgical manipulation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of spinal anesthesia using two different doses of fentanyl combined with low-dose levobupivacaine in anorectal surgery. METHODS: in this prospective, double-blind study, 52 American Society of Anaesthesiologists I-II patients scheduled for elective anorectal surgery were randomized into two groups. The patients in group I received intrathecal 2. 5 mg hyperbaric levobupivacaine plus 12. 5 µg fentanyl and in group II received intrathecal 2. 5 mg hyperbaric levobupivacaine plus 25 µg fentanyl. All the patients remained in the seated position for 5 min after completion of the spinal anesthesia. Sensory block was evaluated with pin-prick test and motor block was evaluated with a modified Bromage scale. RESULTS: motor block was not observed in both of the groups. The sensory block was limited to the S 2 level in group I, and S 1 level in group II. None of the patients required additional analgesics during the operation. Time to two-segment regression was shorter in group I compared with group II (p < 0. 01). One patient in group I and 5 patients in group II had pruritus.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesAnalyzing the {{literature}} and elaborating recommendations on the following topics: relevance of dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) lesions, surgical treatment for posttraumatic syringomyelia, other therapeutic approaches (peripheral nerve root pain, nerve trunk pain and Sign Posterior Cord [SCI] pain). Material and MethodsThe methodology used, proposed by the French Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (SOFMER), includes a systematic review of {{the literature}}, the gathering of information regarding current clinical practices and a validation by a multidisciplinary panel of experts. ResultsNinety-two articles were selected, 10 {{with a level of}} evidence at 2, 82 with a level of evidence at 4. Some articles lacked information on the type of injury, the pain characteristics and the symptoms’ evolution over time. DrezThis type of procedure has been validated for its effectiveness on pain at the level of injury (transitional zone pain), but is inefficient for pain located below the level of injury. Posttraumatic syringomyelia (PTS) : suspected when there is an increased neurological impairment, changes below the level of injury (mainly bladder dysfunctions) or a sudden onset of pain. The surgery associates arachnoid grafting, cyst drainage, expansile dural plasty (same treatment for posttraumatic tethered spinal cord and posttraumatic myelomalacia). Peripheral nerve root, nerve trunk or transitional zone painSurgical implants (screws or clips) can generate radicular pain caused by inflammation and they can even move around with time. The material-induced constraints can also trigger pain. Surgical removal of osteosynthesis material (with an eventual <b>saddle</b> <b>block)</b> remains a simple procedure yielding good results. Correcting surgeries can also be performed (malunion and nonunion). Finally, compressive neuropathies (carpal tunnel syndrome, ulnar nerve entrapment) already have a well-defined treatment. ConclusionThe literature review can define the relevance of surgical treatments on some types of SCI pain.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relative risk of perinatal complications in common childhood disorders. Specifically, the ability of perinatal complications to predict membership into children's disorders was studied. The sample consisted of 634 normal children and children with mental retardation, learning disabilities, and emotional handicaps, whose mothers completed the Maternal Perinatal Scale (WS). Seven MPS items significantly contributed {{to the prediction of}} the mentally retarded, learning disabled, emotionally handicapped, and regular education groups. The two significant discriminant functions correctly classified about 46 % of the students, with the greatest misclassification occuring for those with emotional handicaps. When the separate disorders were collapsed to form a single group, eleven MPS items significantly contributed to the prediction of the special education and regular education groups. The linear composite from discriminant function analysis correctly classified about 74 % of the students. Some 89 % of the special education students were correctly classified. When MPS factors were used as predictors, 90 % of the special education students were correctly classified. Seven MPS factors comprised the discriminant function. Relative risk ratios were computed for each perinatal item. Significant relative risk ratios included maternal weight over 151 pounds, <b>saddle</b> <b>block</b> anesthesia, no anesthesia, stress during pregnancy, prenatal care, medically induced labor, unplanned pregnancy, medication use during pregnancy, hypoxia, and cigarette use during pregnancy. An overall relative risk of 6. 35 was computed based on the linear composite of perinatal variables defined by the discriminant function, suggesting that a suggesting that a synergism of perinatal complications makes a child over 6 {{times more likely to be}} placed in special education. A second overall relative risk of 3. 83 was derived from the linear composite of MPS factor scores. This indicated that children with a perinatal history marked by this particular combination of perinatal complications were nearly 4 times as likely to require special educational services. Results were discussed in terms of comorbidity among special education categories. The potential use of the MPS as a screener for early intervention was also discussed.

40|$|Fission-fragment mass {{distributions}} are asymmetric in fission {{of typical}} actinide nuclei for nucleon number A {{in the range}} 228 A 258 and proton number Z in the range 90 Z 100. For somewhat lighter systems {{it has been observed}} that fission mass distributions are usually symmetric. However, a recent experiment showed that fission of ^ 180 Hg following electron capture on ^ 180 Tl is asymmetric. We calculate potential-energy surfaces for a typical actinide nucleus and for 12 even isotopes in the range ^ 178 Hg [...] ^ 200 Hg, to investigate the similarities and differences of actinide compared to mercury potential surfaces and to what extent fission-fragment properties, in particular shell structure, relate to the structure of the static potential-energy surfaces. Potential-energy surfaces are calculated in the macroscopic-microscopic approach as functions of fiveshape coordinates for more than five million shapes. The structure of the surfaces are investigated by use of an immersion technique. We determine properties of minima, saddle points, valleys, and ridges between valleys in the 5 D shape-coordinate space. Along the mercury isotope chain the barrier heights and the ridge heights and persistence with elongation vary significantly and show no obvious connection to possible fragment shell structure, in contrast to the actinide region, where there is a deep asymmetric valley extending from the saddle point to scission. The mechanism of asymmetric fission must be very different in the lighter proton-rich mercury isotopes compared to the actinide region and is apparently unrelated to fragment shell structure. Isotopes lighter than ^ 192 Hg have the <b>saddle</b> point <b>blocked</b> from a deep symmetric valley by a significant ridge. The ridge vanishes for the heavier Hg isotopes, for which we would expect a qualitatively different asymmetry of the fragments. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
