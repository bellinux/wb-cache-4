5|$|In 2004, French {{officials}} {{decided to}} build a satellite museum {{on the site of}} an abandoned coal pit in the former mining town of Lens to relieve the crowded Paris Louvre, increase total museum visits, and improve the industrial north's economy. Six cities were considered for the project: Amiens, Arras, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais, Lens, and Valenciennes. In 2004, French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin chose Lens to be the site of the new building, the Louvre-Lens. Japanese architects <b>SANAA</b> were selected to design the Lens project in 2005.

FUNDAPAT has reached to extend coverage of potable water to 105,000 persons in 104 communities, in particular in the metropolitan area of Tegucigalpa. The communities pay back investment into a rotating fund without interests to maintain the Foundation's capital and make possible the extension of coverage to more quarters. <b>SANAA</b> created a special unit for supporting those projects in poor areas.|$|E

Based on primary research in Cairo, he published [...] "The Origin of the Anwa' in Arab Tradition" [...] in Studia Islamica (74:5-28, 1991), presenting the theory that the origin of the lunar station (manazil al-qamar) concept in Arab tradition was an Islamic mixing of the zodiacal grid from India with indigenous pre-Islamic Arab folk calendars and that the system of 28 distinct markers did not exist in Arabia prior to Islam, despite the claims of later Muslim scholars. The bulk of Varisco's textual analysis has been on agricultural texts and almanacs, especially for Yemen.|$|R
40|$|The {{image is}} a medium of representation, not only for {{transferring}} information {{but also for the}} reproduction of knowledge. Each step of this reproduction process, which can also be considered as a form of design, has an act and meaning in the context of understanding and interacting with the world. The normative position of the architectural image, as a design act, also has a subjective characteristic that enables the audience to empathise with and experience the aesthetic perception of the designer. From this point, the paper focuses on the reproduction of the architectural image through the evolution of the museum and the aesthetic experience within the example of <b>SANAA’s</b> Louvre-Lens Museum. The built example in question indicates a new thinking and presents a new approach for the interrelation of the audience, work of art, and the designed space. As a designed and built architectural image itself, the museum building reproduces a new aesthetic experience, furthermore a new image, with the involvement of new audience. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Agriculture is the {{mainstay}} of Yemen's economy, generating more than 20 {{percent of gross domestic}} product (GDP) since 1990 (20.4 percent in 2005 according to the Central Bank of Yemen) and employing more than half (54.2 percent in 2003) of the working population. However, a U.S. government estimate suggests that the sector accounted for only 13.5 percent of GDP in 2005. Numerous environmental problems hamper growth in this sector—soil erosion, sand dune encroachment, and deforestation—but the greatest problem by far is the scarcity of water. As a result of low levels of rainfall, agriculture in Yemen relies heavily on the extraction of groundwater, a resource that is being depleted. Yemen's water tables are falling by approximately two meters a year, and it is estimated that <b>Sanaa's</b> groundwater supplies could be exhausted by 2008. The use of irrigation has made fruit and vegetables Yemen's primary cash crops. With the rise in the output of irrigated crops, the production of traditional rain-fed crops such as cereals has declined. According to the Central Bank of Yemen, in 2005 the production of khat, a mildly narcotic and heavily cultivated plant that produces natural stimulants when its leaves are chewed, rose 6.7 percent and accounted for 5.8 percent of GDP; its usage in Yemen is widespread. According to the World Bank and other economists, cultivation of this plant plays a dominant role in Yemen's agricultural economy, constituting 10 percent of GDP and employing an estimated 150,000 persons while consuming an estimated 30 percent of irrigation water and displacing land areas that could otherwise be used for exportable coffee, fruits, and vegetables.|$|R

5000|$|Rabbi Qafiḥ {{had served}} {{as one of the}} chief {{instructors}} in the city's largest seat of learning (yeshiva), held then in the synagogue known as Bayt Saleḥ, until a famine in 1905, resulting from a war with the Ottoman Turks, forced the closure of the yeshiva. In the spring of 1906, Rabbi Yihya Qafiḥ was confirmed by the ruling monarch as one of four representatives of the Jewish community in Sana'a, along with Harun al-Cohen, Yiḥya Yitzḥak Halevi and Yiḥya al-Abyadh. The document outlined the obligations of the Jewish community toward the Muslim State and the Poll Tax (Ar. al-jizya) assessed against every male 13 years of age and older. In 1909, he became the headmaster of a Jewish school built by the Ottoman Turks in Sana'a, known as al-Makktab He initiated many reforms in Jewish education, such as teaching arithmetic and geography alongside the Torah, and employing Turkish teachers in the school for teaching the Turkish language to Jewish youth. One of the failures of the school, according to Yemen's last Chief Rabbi, Rabbi Amram Qorah, was that by teaching the Turkish language, their study of Hebrew suffered, seeing that the Jewish youth had less time to fully acclimate themselves to the rules of Hebrew grammar and to the finesse of the language. During this time, the controversy over the study of the Zohar worsened. After being incarcerated twice by Muslim authorities in 1914, being released only in Adar of 1915, Rabbi Qafiḥ regretted his earlier reticence in not speaking out against certain ills of the community. He began to be more vociferous about the people's neglect of Halacha for more mystical matters. It was around this time that he augmented the Dor Deʻah movement in Orthodox Judaism, to counter the influence of Lurianic Kabbalah and restore the rational approach to Judaism, such as is represented by the thought of Maimonides and Sa'adiah Gaon, and to encourage strict adherence to the Halakha as formulated in the Mishneh Torah. However, the innovations and textual readings enacted by Rabbi Qafih in his Beit midrash were the main cause for the schism in <b>Sanaa's</b> Jewish community, a schism that was fanned perpetually by [...] "highly spirited youth." [...] Since the Darda'im were interspersed in all the synagogues in Sana'a, the proprietors of those synagogues feared that this would lead to changes in their own rituals and customs, which they strongly opposed.|$|R

25|$|In 2003, a new {{framework}} law for water supplyand sanitation was passed. It includes service decentralization {{from the national}} utility, <b>SANAA,</b> to the municipalities.
