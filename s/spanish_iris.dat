50|$|In June 2004, a joint University of Reading-Natural History Museum funded group (including Dr Stephen Jury - Reading University's Herbarium Curator) {{was sent}} on an {{expedition}} to Morocco in 2004. They found a group of irises similar in form to Iris serotina, in north Morocco (north of the Kebdana Mountains), at a height of 90m above sea level. Dr Jury sent {{a sample of the}} new iris to Dr Pablo Vargas,(a former Reading University student), now working on related <b>Spanish</b> <b>irises</b> in Madrid.Later, in 2006, another team from Real Jardin Botanico de Madrid(Spanish for Royal Botanical Garden of Madrid) travelled to the same area and found the same species of iris. Then a detailed morphological, phylogenetic and karyological research was carried out on specimens of this iris species. It was found to be distinct from Iris serotina.|$|R
50|$|Arco <b>Iris</b> (<b>Spanish</b> for Rainbow) were a {{rock group}} from the late 1960s until the late 1970s in Argentina, {{influential}} in Argentine rock history. While tagged as an 'acoustic' Argentine rock band in the beginning, Arco Iris were pioneers (with Chilean band Los Jaivas), infusing rock with regional folk music, {{as well as one}} of the first bands that projected their beliefs through their music and lifestyle (in their case around the art of yoga). In the 1980s Arco Iris minus Santaolalla moved to the United States to live in the mountains of California, where they have been involved in the jazz-rock and new-age music scene.|$|R
