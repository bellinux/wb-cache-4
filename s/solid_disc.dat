50|$|The Monster's {{brake system}} {{components}} including master cylinders and discs are supplied by Brembo. The front has 320 mm floating dual discs and radially mounted 4 piston Brembo p4.32 calipers. The 245 mm rear <b>solid</b> <b>disc</b> have a two-piston p34 caliper. Anti-lock braking system (ABS) is optional.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2000 model year, a new version, the X4 LD ("Low Down"), was introduced. It {{offered a}} {{slightly}} lower seat and overall frame, improved suspension (with [...] "piggyback"-style Showa rear shock absorbers), and minor cosmetic differences including an unpainted engine block (versus {{the black of}} the original) and lightweight latticework inner rotors on the front brakes (the originals were <b>solid</b> <b>discs).</b>|$|R
50|$|Brakes {{were the}} same across the range using a hub {{integrated}} (i.e. not a hat rotor) front ventilated disc design of 287 mm and single piston callipers sliding on the hub carrier. The rear used <b>solid</b> <b>discs</b> also at 287 mm and the rear callipers carried over the Ford handbrake system using a threaded piston applying the handbrake cable forces to the rear disc pads.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{phenomena}} {{associated with the}} low-velocity impact of two <b>solid</b> <b>discs</b> of equal size using a cell model of brittle solids. The fragment ejection exhibits a jet-like structure the direction of which depends on the impact parameter. We obtain the velocity and the mass distribution of the debris. Varying the radius and the initial velocity of the colliding particles, the velocity components of the fragments show anomalous scaling. The mass distribution follows a power law {{in the region of}} intermediate masses. ...|$|R
50|$|Its {{powerful}} transverse-mounted, inline four-cylinder, water-cooled {{engine was}} later {{used in the}} 1998 through 2002 model years of the Honda CB1300, although the X4 version had different carburetors and was geared to provide more low-end torque. The X4 is characterized by its low-slung profile, <b>solid</b> <b>disc</b> rear wheel, bulbous yet angular side panels, and stubby, large-diameter, chrome exhausts.|$|E
5000|$|Upon its release, Fever {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, as reflected from the achieved score of 63/100 based on 12 critic reviews Metacritic. Allmusic states {{that on this}} third disc, the band [...] "consolidate their style and split the difference between their two previous discs" [...] and describes the album as [...] "a <b>solid</b> <b>disc</b> by a group that knows its own strengths".|$|E
5000|$|The DRG Class 86 was a {{standard}} goods train tank locomotive of the DRG. It {{was intended for}} duties on branch lines and was manufactured by almost all the locomotive building firms producing for the DRG. From 1942, a simplified wartime version was built, on which the most obvious changes were the omission of the second side windows in the cab and the <b>solid</b> <b>disc</b> carrying wheels.|$|E
50|$|The car's {{handling}} was aided {{with the}} factory-tuning of the car's suspension {{and the addition}} of low-profile 17-inch wheels. A front strut tower brace, extra-firm springs, revised shock damping, firmer front polyurethane bushings, dual-tip muffler, plus front stabilizer bars were also standard. Standard brakes were vented discs for the front brakes and <b>solid</b> <b>discs</b> at the rear, or optional Brembo brakes for the 2004 to 2006 year models. A four-wheel anti-lock braking system was also optional on non-Brembo models, which was packaged with front-seat side-impact air bags.|$|R
50|$|The Honda City was {{initially}} launched with a twin-spark, lean burn ‘i-DSI’ engine producing 88ps that was primarily {{designed to provide}} outstanding fuel economy. The VTEC version of the Honda City was launched later in 2004. The VTEC trim of the Honda City is offered with 15-inch alloy wheels compared to the 14-inch offered in the i-DSI and the rear brakes are <b>solid</b> <b>discs</b> on the VTEC variant instead of drums in the i-DSI. Also, the VTEC model uses a 7-speed Multimatic CVT automatic transmission.|$|R
5000|$|Weight plates may {{incorporate}} {{holes for}} ease of carrying (called [...] "grip plates") or be <b>solid</b> <b>discs</b> (especially those used for competition). Non-competition plates often have variable diameters and widths, such as on the adjustable dumbbells pictured right, with heavier plates generally being larger in diameter, thickness, or both. Weight plates are typically round, although 12-sided and other polygonal varieties exist. [...] Most plates are coated with enamel paint or hammertone to resist corrosion; more expensive varieties may be coated with chrome, rubber, or plastic.|$|R
5000|$|Model years: 2002 - 2006.The {{original}} V-Rod had a [...] Revolution Engine, {{producing a}} claimed [...] at the crank. The V-Rod had 49 mm forks and a 180 mm rear tire, with <b>solid</b> <b>disc</b> wheels. The VRSCAs were all factory equipped with [...] fuel tanks. In 2006 the VRSCA {{was equipped with}} Brembo Brakes. The VRSCA was only offered with forward controls. 2003 models {{were included in the}} 100th anniversary edition.|$|E
50|$|For better handling, it had MacPherson struts {{up front}} with {{multi-link}} rear suspension (with parallel arms). This independent setup combined with the longer wheelbase gave good comfort on the highway, and a pretty good grip for aggressive cornering. For many Preseas, the car was endowed with a ventilated front disc brakes with a single large piston. The rear brakes were either a <b>solid</b> <b>disc</b> brake or a semi-trailing drum brakes with self-adjusting shoes.|$|E
5000|$|Bill Ribas of NY Rock showed disgruntlement in the albums {{similarity}} to other popular rock groups and its overtly polished sound. However, he commended all four band members and described Joyride as [...] "varied and engaging, {{and more than}} enough to get the blood flowing on a cold day." [...] Ribas added, [...] "Its a <b>solid</b> <b>disc</b> that will probably grow on me as time goes by, and might do the same to you." ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} fracture and {{fragmentation of}} solids due to impact at low energies using a two-dimensional dynamical model of granular solids. Simulating collisions of two <b>solid</b> <b>discs</b> we show that, {{depending on the}} initial energy, {{the outcome of a}} collision process can be classified into two states: a damaged and a fragmented state with a sharp transition in between. We give numerical evidence that the transition point between the two states behaves as a critical point, and we discuss the possible mechanism of the transition.

40|$|The aim of our {{experiment}} on the Spacelab Dl Mission was {{to study the}} stability of long liquid columns under microgravity. Nominal configuration was a cylindrical liquid bridge anchored {{at the edges of}} two equal <b>solid</b> <b>discs,</b> 35 mm in diameter. Mechanical stimuli were applied through the discs and the liquid outer shape recorded for analysis. Nominal experiment procedures [1] were similar to those proposed for Spacelab- 1 (1983), where by wetting problems allowed only partial success [2]. The same Fluid Physics Module, but with corrected end discs and a manually operated syringe for liquid injection, was used...|$|R
50|$|The DRG Class 86 was a {{standard}} (see Einheitsdampflokomotive) goods train tank locomotive with the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft. It {{was intended for}} duties on branch lines and was delivered by almost all the locomotive building firms working for the Reichsbahn. From 1942 {{it was built in}} a simplified version as a 'transitional war locomotive' (Übergangskriegslokomotive or ÜK). The most obvious changes were the omission of the second side windows in the cab and the <b>solid</b> <b>disc</b> carrying wheels.|$|E
5000|$|Also another {{feature of}} it is the Aisin 8 Speed Automatic which will improve fuel {{efficiency}} and not sacrificing in-gear acceleration and also available with 6 Speed Manual.

5000|$|The Alexanderson {{alternator}} works {{similarly to}} an AC electric generator, but generates higher-frequency current, {{in the radio}} range. The rotor has no conductive windings or electrical connections; it consists of a <b>solid</b> <b>disc</b> of high tensile strength magnetic steel, with narrow slots cut in its circumference to create a series of narrow [...] "teeth" [...] that function as magnetic poles. The space between the teeth is filled with nonmagnetic material, to give the rotor a smooth surface to decrease aerodynamic drag. The rotor is turned at a high speed by an electric motor.|$|E

50|$|The C4 {{does not}} feature Citroën's Hydractive suspension, which is {{reserved}} for higher class models, such as the C5 and C6. The Picasso version can feature a pneumatic rear suspension. The C4 breaks with the past on other fronts, in particular by removing the rear autodirezionale solution, used {{up to that time}} on the Xsara and ZX. The suspension is the usual type MacPherson strut front suspension with coil springs, while the rear has interconnected wheels with torsion beam and torsion bars. The braking system includes ventilated discs on the front, and rear <b>solid</b> <b>discs</b> with ABS and ESP (not standard versions with basic fittings). The steering is rack and pinion with electro-hydraulic power steering.|$|R
50|$|The brakes {{were also}} {{modified}} to have Anti-lock braking system removed {{as well as}} the original ventilated front <b>discs</b> and <b>solid</b> rear <b>discs</b> and replaced by cross-drilled and slotted DBA (Disc Brake Australia) discs all round. M1144 series brake pads were supplied by Mintex Racing.|$|R
5000|$|Malaysia: The Yaris {{was also}} {{available}} in Malaysia, powered by the 1NZ-FE engine with 4-cylinder DOHC with VVT-i. It comes in 2 trim levels: 1.5 G and 1.5 S, both with 4-speed automatic transmission with Super ECT and Gate Shifter, featuring an output of [...] at 6000 rpm, and a torque of 141 Nm at 4200 rpm. The 1.5S variant comes with 15" [...] <b>solid</b> <b>disc</b> brakes for the front wheels, front and rear bumper spoilers, side skirt and rear spoiler, amber Optitron meter, a black center cluster, leather wrapped gearshift.|$|E
50|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>disc</b> {{wheels are}} used as well, though in outdoor {{settings}} these are generally not used on the front wheel because they are difficult to handle in crosswinds. Disc wheels provide a significant aerodynamic advantage when mounted on the rear wheel improving laminar flow over the rear half of the bike. Recent developments in technology {{have given rise to}} disc wheels with a dimpled surface like a golf ball, also in the name of aerodynamics. Disc wheels are not permitted at the Ironman World Championships in Kona Hawaii, as large crosswinds are not uncommon and present an unsafe situation to athletes.|$|E
5000|$|Ford {{produced}} a Ford Puma kit car, {{which was designed}} specifically for rallying. The Puma's technical details included a Zetec SE all-alloy engine with four cylinders and 16 valves at 1596 cm3, power over [...] at 9000 rpm, front wheel drive via a Hewland six-speed sequential gearbox, limited slip differential, dynamic front suspension using MacPherson struts with adjustable spring platforms, Ford Racing rear trailing arm beam with adjustable dynamic suspension, Alcon front brakes with 355 mm diameter ventilated discs using four-piston calipers, Alcon 260 mm diameter <b>solid</b> <b>disc</b> rear brakes with two piston calipers, a welded steel safety roll cage, and front and rear wheel arches and bumpers in composite.|$|E
50|$|The SHO was {{redesigned}} for 1992, {{although it}} continued {{with the same}} powertrain as before: The Yamaha Built V-6 engine and 5-speed manual transmission. The second generation SHO borrowed from the Mercury Sable's front fenders, hood, and headlights, but used a different bumper, fog lamps, and no middle lightbar. The SHO also got unique seats, side cladding, dual exhaust, {{as well as a}} unique rear bumper. 1992 models can be visually identified by not containing a rear trunklid spoiler, having downturned exhaust tips, and only a driver's side airbag (later models have both driver's and passenger airbags). For MY 1993, the rear brakes on the SHO were converted to <b>solid</b> <b>discs,</b> replacing the vented discs of almost identical dimensions that were used in the 1989-1992 model years.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} safety equipment, the Futura, XR and Fairmont models all had ABS brakes in {{addition}} to a driver's side airbag, which was the only main safety feature on the Falcon S and Forté. The brakes featured 287x24 mm vented front discs and 287x10.5 mm <b>solid</b> rear <b>discs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 2006 Impreza WRX models {{gained some}} chassis and braking system enhancements. On sedan models, {{aluminum}} front suspension lower A-arms reduced unsprung weight. (The rear suspension gained forward aluminum lateral links in the 2005 model year.) The steering rack was updated for improved steering feel and the steering rack ratio {{was changed to}} 15.0:1. On all WRX models, 7-spoke 17 x 7 in aluminum-alloy wheels replaced the previous 5 spoke 16 x 6.5 in wheels. Tires were 215/45ZR17 versus 205/55R16 before. The more powerful brake system employed 11.5 in vented front discs and four-piston calipers instead of the previous versions two-piston calipers. The rear brakes were 11.3 in ventilated discs replacing the previous 10.3 in <b>solid</b> <b>discs,</b> and two-piston calipers replacing single-piston calipers. The calipers are painted red with the SUBARU name in white overlain.|$|R
