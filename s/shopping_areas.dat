40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} an {{adaptation}} of a <b>shopping</b> <b>area</b> to socio-environmental changes using the concept of 'dynamic maintenance'. Different from an orthodox concept of maintenance, 'dynamic maintenance', which was proposed by N. Saito in 2003, refers to relations among structures, functions and changes of a system and can be applicable to social phenomena. Based on Saito(2009), we derived the next two point. First, if shops in a <b>shopping</b> <b>area</b> turnover time and again, {{it does not necessarily}} mean loss of identity of a <b>shopping</b> <b>area.</b> Second, because a process of 'dynamic maintenance' involves positive action for environments, shops in a <b>shopping</b> <b>area</b> eventually create their environment by themselves. Further we argue that cooperation among actors in a <b>shopping</b> <b>area</b> is a fundamental condition for sustainability of a <b>shopping</b> <b>area.</b> On the ground of these theoretical discussions, we tried to empirically elucidate causality among cooperation in a shopping are, commitments to a <b>shopping</b> <b>area,</b> and ties among shops. Using 'analysis of covariance structure', we tentatively concluded that 'cooperation' was generated from 'commitments' and 'ties' in a <b>shopping</b> <b>area.</b> 本稿では、斉藤(2009) のダイナミック・メンテナンスをめぐる議論を前提に、構造、機能および変動の問題を同時に考察する枠組みを商店街を例にとって考察した。まず最初に、商店街の同一性の問題をダイナミック・メンテナンスの視点から理論的に検討し、構成要素の頻繁な入れ替わりがあったとしても、同一のシステムとして存在しうることを議論した。また、社会システムの環境適応にプロセスについては、既存のメンテナンス概念ではとらえきれないことを手短かに整理し、環境受動的ばかりでなく、第 4 の特長としての”環境創造”の過程が存在しることを指摘した。これらの理論的検討を通じて、商店街のダイナミック・メンテナンスにおいては、協力性の存在がもっとも重要な条件であることを示した。最後に、これらの理論的検討を受ける形で、協力性が実際に商店街においてどのように形成され、またそれが愛着、つきあいなどの諸変数を規定するかに関して、共分散構造分析を用いて検討した。その結果、協力性は愛着、つながり、創業から年数によって促進されることがあきらかになった...|$|R
