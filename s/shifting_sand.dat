25|$|Work on the {{colliery}} – one of {{the pioneering}} mines of the East Durham coalfield, began on 19 February 1838 but it was five years before the first coals were drawn. Problems with pockets of <b>shifting</b> <b>sand</b> {{and the depth of}} the magnesium limestone overlying the coal delayed the work, making the project hugely expensive. Late shifts were even introduced for the first time, so that excavation could be carried out around the clock to finish the three-shafted pit as quickly as possible.|$|E
25|$|A rough, six week voyage {{ended in}} a storm off Orleans, Massachusetts on Cape Cod when the heavily loaded “Sparrow-Hawk” was driven onto the {{isolated}} Nauset Beach. All aboard survived and were removed to the nearby Plymouth Colony. Storms and <b>shifting</b> <b>sand</b> buried the wrecked pinnace within several weeks. Sparrow-Hawk remained buried until May, 1863 storms uncovered the hull which was soon salvaged. Keel, planks, rudder and other hull elements from the Sparrow-Hawk were found in good condition, removed from the beach and carefully reconstructed for subsequent exhibition.|$|E

25|$|Lake Mungo 3 (LM3) was {{discovered}} by ANU geomorphologist Dr. Jim Bowler on 26 February 1974 when <b>shifting</b> <b>sand</b> dunes exposed the remains. He was found near Lake Mungo, one of several dry lakes in the southeast part of the continent and 500m east of the LM1 site. The body was sprinkled with red ochre, in the earliest known {{example of such a}} sophisticated and artistic burial practice. This aspect of the discovery has been particularly significant to Indigenous Australians, since it indicates that certain cultural traditions have existed on the Australian continent for much longer than previously thought. At the time of LM3's discovery, it was believed that Aboriginals had arrived in Australia from Asia around 20,000 years ago. Further archeological finds at Lake Mungo suggests that human occupation of the area dates as far back as 50,000 years ago.|$|E
500|$|Infantry {{from the}} 52nd (Lowland) Division joined the two mounted brigades at Romani between 11 May and 4 June, when the {{development}} of the railway made it possible to transport and supply such a large number of soldiers. The infantry occupied a defensive position known as Wellington Ridge, facing a tangle of sand dunes. The area favoured defence; sand dunes, stretching about [...] inland, covered an area of , including, to the south of Romani, the northern route from El Arish. On the southern and south eastern edges, a series of dunes of <b>shifting</b> <b>sand</b> with narrow sloping lanes led to a tableland of deep soft sand.|$|E
500|$|The 52nd (Lowland) Division {{developed}} a strong defensive position at Romani {{which had its}} left flank on the Mediterranean Sea, here a series of redoubts were built running southwards from Mahamdiyah {{along the line of}} high sand hills about [...] to a dune known as Katib Gannit [...] high. This line of sand hills, which were high enough to see Katia oasis from, marked the eastern edge of an area of very soft and <b>shifting</b> <b>sand</b> beyond which were lower dunes and harder sand where movement by both infantry and mounted forces was considerably easier. Between the shore at the western end of the Bardawil Lagoon and Katib Gannit (the principal tactical point on the eastern slopes of the Romani heights), the infantry constructed a line of 12 redoubts about [...] apart, with a second series of redoubts covering the Romani railway station and the right of the defensive position which curved like a hook westward, then northward. A total of 18 redoubts were constructed, which when fully garrisoned held from 40 to 170 rifles each, with Lewis guns and an average of two Vickers machine guns allotted to each position; they were well wired {{on the right side of}} each of the positions, although there was no wire between the redoubts. This defensive line was supported by artillery.|$|E

2500|$|The Thar Desert extends {{between the}} Aravalli Hills in the north-east, the Great Rann of Kutch {{along the coast}} and the {{alluvial}} plains of the Indus River {{in the west and}} north-west. Most of the desert is covered by huge <b>shifting</b> <b>sand</b> dunes that receive sediments from the alluvial plains and the coast. The sand is highly mobile due to strong winds occurring before the onset of the monsoon. The Luni River is the only river integrated into the desert. Rainfall is limited to [...] per year, mostly falling from July to September.|$|E
2500|$|The {{soil of the}} Thar Desert remains dry {{for much}} of the year and is prone to wind erosion.

2500|$|Cage {{design is}} {{important}} in preventing escape of juveniles and entry of predators and also shading of algal and seaweed on rocks. Recommended designs include cages with 8x8mm plastic mesh and an aluminium frame. Steel reef, plastic reef and plastic floating cages have proven ineffective as steel reef cages allowed high mortality from predator entry and plastic cages induced shading of the rocks algae and seaweed are attached to which results in low productivity. Suitable locations for reef cages are sand and rubble bottom reef bases exposed to less wave action [...] or fore-flat zones which are 10m behind the reef crest with water depths of 0 to 2.5m during spring-tides. <b>Shifting</b> <b>sand</b> and sediment deposition areas may smother foraging surfaces {{and need to be}} avoided when allocating cages;. Wind-ward sections of the reef flat are considered suitable sites. Floating cages require frequent cleaning to remove fouling species and allow high water flow and/ or nutrient flux for high algal biomass and quality. [...] Other environmental factors such as water temperature and salinity can have seasonal and episodic effects on the growth of the juveniles.|$|E
2500|$|Until {{late in the}} 19th century, {{there was}} not a single road leading in or out of Provincetown – the only way to travel by land to the rest of Cape Cod was to first head north, {{traversing}} a series of tall, rolling sand dunes, and to then follow the thin strip of beach along the northern shore line, known as the [...] "backshore". [...] A wooden bridge was erected over the East Harbor in 1854, only to be destroyed by a winter storm and ice two years later. [...] Although the bridge was replaced the following year, a traveler using it still had to traverse several miles over a sand route, which, together with the backshore route, would occasionally be washed out by storms. [...] Prior to the railroad's arrival in 1873, Provincetown was like an island, in that it relied almost entirely upon the sea for its communication, travel, and commerce needs. [...] All of this was doubly true of Long Point, being isolated from its own nearest neighbor, the rest of the town of Provincetown. [...] To reach the closest edge of town from Long Point by land, one had to make a difficult trek across a [...] beach route past Wood End to Herring Cove, and then another mile (...) over continuously <b>shifting</b> <b>sand</b> dunes. [...] To complicate matters, portions of that route were underwater twice each day with the high tide.|$|E
