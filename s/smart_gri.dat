With the locational marginal price at the substation node known, the DSO runs an upper level auction with aggregators as intermediate agents competing for energy.

This auction mechanism is a straightforward implementation of projected gradient descent on the social welfare (SW) of all home level agents.

With more and more group applications, data and appliances proliferated in smart grid, electricity customers are faced with extended privacy risks.

In particular, hybrid architecture is constructed to achieve both fault-tolerance and efficiency with only one set of group key installed.

First, we prove the uniqueness of the consumption profile corresponding to the Nash equilibrium, and we analyze its efficiency by providing a bound on the Price of Anarchy. Next, we address the computational issue of the equilibrium profile by providing two algorithms: the cycling best response dynamics and a projected gradient descent method, and by giving an upper bound on their convergence rate to the equilibrium.

However, when EVs participate in Supplementary Frequency Regulation (SFR), {{it is challenging to}} simultaneously achieve the dispatch of the control center and the expected State of Charge (SOC) levels of EV batteries. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a Vehicle-to-Grid (V 2 G) control strategy, in which an uncertain dispatch is implemented in the control center without detailed EV charging/discharging information. The regulation from the control center is achieved by allocating the regulation task within the frequency regulation capacity (FRC) of EVs. The expected SOC levels of EV batteries are guaranteed by a real-time correction of their scheduled V 2 G power in EV charging stations. Simulations on an interconnected two-area power system validate the effectiveness of the proposed V 2 G control in achieving both the frequency regulation and the expected SOC levels of EVs.

Transparency of market data facilitates a competitive and efficient energy environment, yet it may also reveal critical physical system information. Recovering the grid topology based solely on publicly available market data is explored here. Real-time energy prices are calculated as the Lagrange multipliers of network-constrained economic dispatch; that is, via a linear program (LP) typically solved every 5 minutes. Granted the grid Laplacian is a parameter of this LP, one could infer such a topology-revealing matrix upon observing successive LP dual outcomes. The matrix of spatio-temporal prices is first shown to factor {{as the product of}} the inverse Laplacian times a sparse matrix. Leveraging results from sparse matrix decompositions, topology recovery schemes with complementary strengths are subsequently formulated.

40|$|In this paper, {{the optimal}} power flow (OPF) problem is {{augmented}} {{to account for}} the costs associated with the load-following control of a power network. Load-following control costs are expressed through the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). The power network is described by a set of nonlinear differential algebraic equations (DAEs). By linearizing the DAEs around a known equilibrium, a linearized OPF that accounts for steady-state operational constraints is formulated first. This linearized OPF is then augmented by a set of linear matrix inequalities that are algebraically equivalent to the implementation of an LQR controller. The resulting formulation, termed LQR-OPF, is a semidefinite program which furnishes optimal steady-state setpoints and an optimal feedback law to steer the system to the new steady state with minimum load-following control costs. Numerical tests demonstrate that the setpoints computed by LQR-OPF result in lower overall costs and frequency deviations compared to the setpoints of a scheme where OPF and load-following control are considered separately.

Specifically, the utility does not know the cost function of consumers and cannot have multiple rounds of information exchange with consumers. We formulate an optimization problem for the utility to minimize its operational cost considering time-varying demand response targets and responses of consumers. We develop a joint online learning and pricing algorithm. In each time slot, the utility sends out a price signal to all consumers and estimates the cost functions of consumers based on their noisy responses. We measure the performance of our algorithm using regret analysis and show that our online algorithm achieves logarithmic regret {{with respect to the}} operating horizon. In addition, our algorithm employs linear regression to estimate the aggregate response of consumers, making it easy to implement in practice.

However, recent research shows that carefully synthesized false-data injection attacks can bypass the security system and introduce arbitrary errors to state estimates. In this paper, we use graphical methods to study defending mechanisms against false-data injection attacks on power system state estimation. By securing carefully selected meter measurements, no false data injection attack can be launched to compromise any set of state variables. We characterize the optimal protection problem, which protects the state variables with minimum number of measurements, as a variant Steiner tree problem in a graph. Based on the graphical characterization, we propose both exact and reduced-complexity approximation algorithms. In particular, we show that the proposed tree-pruning based approximation algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity, while yielding negligible performance degradation compared with the optimal algorithms. The advantageous performance of the proposed defending mechanisms is verified in IEEE standard power system testcases.

By growing such charging station networks, the power grid becomes more congested and, therefore, controlling of charging demands should be carefully aligned with the available resources.

In the first framework, appropriate for large networks, the EV population is expected to constitute a sizable portion of the light duty fleets. This which necessitates controlling the EV charging operations to prevent potential grid failures and distribute the resources efficiently. This framework leverages pricing dynamics in order to control the EV customer request rates and to provide a charging service with the best level of quality of service. The second framework, on the other hand, is more appropriate for smaller networks, in which the objective is to compute the minimum amount of resources required to provide certain levels of quality of service to each class.

Thus, in this paper, we investigate the problem of energy management for multiple data center microgrids. Specifically, we intend to minimize the long-term operational cost of data center microgrids by taking into account the uncertainties in electricity prices, renewable outputs and data center workloads. We first formulate a stochastic programming problem with the considerations of many factors, e. g., providing heterogeneous service delay guarantees for batch workloads, interactive workload allocation, batch workload shedding, electricity buying/selling, battery charging/discharging efficiency, and the ramping constraints of backup generators. Then, we design a realtime and distributed algorithm for the formulated problem based on Lyapunov optimization technique and a variant of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Moreover, the performance guarantees provided by the proposed algorithm are analyzed. Extensive simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in operational cost reduction for data center microgrids.
