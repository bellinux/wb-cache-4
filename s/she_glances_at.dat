6000|$|The widow laughs heartily and really. She {{places a}} {{handkerchief}} over her mouth. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> her brother {{with a pair}} of eyes full of knowing mischief. [...] "Ah, dear James," [...] she says, [...] "you don't {{know what it is to}} have a mother's feelings." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> the shapeless heap, and shuddered. Agravaine nodded.|$|R

6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH, rises, {{and goes}} to the large mirror to wipe away her tears. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Richards, who does not move. She sits down in a seat nearer him than the chair she has left. After some faint murmurs and hesitations, she asks, [...] "Will you please tell me why you went out just now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY (quickly). No. Please don't go yet. Sit down. Please do. (<b>She</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> him irresolutely, then resumes her chair.) They'll {{give you}} your diet of milk and shoo you off to bed on that {{freezing}} porch soon enough, don't worry. I'll {{see to it that}} you don't fracture any rules. (Hitching his chair nearer hers--impulsively.) In all charity to me you've got to stick awhile. I haven't had a chance to really talk to a soul for a week. You found what I said a while ago hard to believe, didn't you? ...|$|E
6000|$|The Lady: [...] "Yes, I see." [...] <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> {{the rear}} of the shop, where the floor is {{littered}} with the leaves and petals of flowers, and sprays of fern and evergreen. A woman, followed by a belated smell of breakfast, which gradually mingles with the odor of the plants, comes out of a door there, and begins to gather the larger fragments into her apron. The lady turns again, and looks at the jars and vases of cut flowers in the window, and on the counter. [...] "What I can't understand is how you know just the quantity of flowers to buy every day. You must often lose a good deal." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> him, a {{question}} in her eyes, then looked away.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> his worn {{clothing}} and soiled white necktie, and smiled.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> me {{swiftly and}} surely; {{and shook her}} head again.|$|R
6000|$|The Lady, {{catching}} it from him, and then, after {{a glance}} at it, starting back with a shriek: [...] "Ah-h-h! How terrible! But it can't be! Oh, I don't know what to think--It is the most dreadful thing that ever--It's impossible!" [...] <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> the paper again, and breaks into a hysterical laugh: [...] "Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha! Why, this is the address that I wrote out for that young gentleman's flowers! You have made a terrible mistake, Mr. Eichenlaub--you have almost killed me. I thought--I thought that woman was sending her funeral flowers to--to"--She holds {{her hand over her}} heart, and sinks into the chair beside the counter, where she lets fall the paper. [...] "You have almost killed me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Besides [...] "Crainquebille" [...] {{this volume}} {{contains}} sixteen other stories and sketches. To define them {{it is enough}} to say that they are written in M. Anatole France's prose. One sketch entitled [...] "Riquet" [...] may be found incorporated in the volume of Monsieur Bergeret a Paris. [...] "Putois" [...] is a remarkable little tale, significant, humorous, amusing, and symbolic. It concerns the career of a man born in the utterance of a hasty and untruthful excuse made by a lady at a loss how to decline without offence a very pressing invitation to dinner from a very tyrannical aunt. This happens in a provincial town, and the lady says in effect: [...] "Impossible, my dear aunt. To-morrow I am expecting the gardener." [...] And the garden <b>she</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> is a poor garden; it is a wild garden; its extent is insignificant and its neglect seems beyond remedy. [...] "A gardener! What for?" [...] asks the aunt. [...] "To work in the garden." [...] And the poor lady is abashed at the transparence of her evasion. But the lie is told, it is believed, and she sticks to it. When the masterful old aunt inquires, [...] "What is the man's name, my dear?" [...] she answers brazenly, [...] "His name is Putois." [...] "Where does he live?" [...] "Oh, I don't know; anywhere. He won't give his address. One leaves a message for him here and there." [...] "Oh! I see," [...] says the other; [...] "he is a sort of ne'er do well, an idler, a vagabond. I advise you, my dear, to be careful how you let such a creature into your grounds; but I have a large garden, and when you do not want his services I shall find him some work to do, and see he does it too. Tell your Putois to come and see me." [...] And thereupon Putois is born; he stalks abroad, invisible, upon his career of vagabondage and crime, stealing melons from gardens and tea-spoons from pantries, indulging his licentious proclivities; becoming {{the talk of the town}} and of the countryside; seen simultaneously in far-distant places; pursued by gendarmes, whose brigadier assures the uneasy householders that he [...] "knows that scamp very well, and won't be long in laying his hands upon him." [...] A detailed description of his person collected from the information furnished by various people appears in the columns of a local newspaper. Putois lives in his strength and malevolence. He lives after the manner of legendary heroes, of the gods of Olympus. He is the creation of the popular mind. There comes a time when even the innocent originator of that mysterious and potent evil-doer is induced to believe for a moment that he may have a real and tangible presence. All this is told with the wit and the art and the philosophy which is familiar to M. Anatole France's readers and admirers. For it is difficult to read M. Anatole France without admiring him. He has the princely gift of arousing a spontaneous loyalty, but with this difference, that the consent of our reason has its place by the side of our enthusiasm. He is an artist. As an artist he awakens emotion. The quality of his art remains, as an inspiration, fascinating and inscrutable; but the proceedings of his thought compel our intellectual admiration.|$|E
5000|$|She begins seeing DCS Brian Holmes (Brian Cowan) in {{the episode}} [...] "Ghost Rider" [...] (2000) and announces their {{engagement}} in [...] "Wavelength" [...] (2000).

Alex gives Katie the unopened letter to read. She goes home to read it and is shocked when she sees Jo's house looking like no one had ever lived in it. Startled, she begins to think that Jo had been a {{complete}} figment of her imagination. Upon reading the letter, Katie realizes that it was written by Alex's late wife, Carly Jo, whom friends called [...] "Jo". Katie realizes that her friend Jo was really Carly's spirit. In the letter, Carly Jo asked Katie to take care of Alex and the children. After Katie reads the letter, she sees lights in her neighbor's house and sees Jo standing in the window, waving farewell.

50|$|Elena sees Cliff in the Mexican prison. He {{tells her}} that he knows a lot of {{information}} about her family, including the fact that her great-great grandfather's name was Augustine. In 1835, he purchased land in what would later become Dallas, but it was taken from him in the Mexican-American War. Elena's father purchased it back, hoping to strike oil. J.R. thought that the land was oil-rich, too. When Elena's father came back from Mexico to collect the land deed, he mentions that J.R. paid someone in the records office to switch the deeds, ensuring that he got the stretch of land belonging to her father that was oil-rich while Elena's father got the land that had no oil. She initially dismisses Cliff's accusation. He tells her that she can have the information verified independently, stating that the Ewings did the same thing to his father, Digger Barnes. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> the land deed, which contains the signatures of both J.R. and her father. Cliff tells {{her that he}} is unable to do anything from prison, but says that she can act as his proxy for the one-third of Barnes-Global that he still owns. He convinces her that the Ewings must pay for the land swindle against her family, hoping to start a Ewing-Ramos feud.|$|E

50|$|On May 30, Cutter offers Natalie {{to serve}} her {{favorite}} {{drink at the}} bar, and orders Nikki to make her a stiff cosmo because she's amazing. Nikki tells Natalie that he says that to every sexy lady that comes to the club, which makes Natalie thinks that Cutter hasn't changed his grifting ways. Cutter tells her that he can prove to her that he's a changed man, but Natalie asks if he's running any illegal activities in the club. Cutter responds by saying that everything he's doing at the club is legit. Cutter then dances with Natalie before he leaves her for a few minutes, but Natalie doesn't want to be alone, and Cutter gets the club's security guard Bruce Hunter to dance with her who she knows by working {{with him at the}} police station since he works as a cop during the day. Natalie then asks Bruce if Cutter hired him to provide security for the place, or to help him cover up shady dealings in the club. Bruce tells Natalie he doesn't know what she's talking about before <b>she</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> Dean giving a stash of drugs to one of the club's DJs before the lights went out. Cutter and Bruce then scramble to get flashlights for the patrons and to calm everyone down. Cutter later runs up to Natalie to surprise her with a passionate kiss.|$|E
5000|$|Early on Christmas Day, Cody {{places a}} Christmas card {{on the family}} Christmas tree, which will direct the family to the Christmas present, a wooden bench (inscribed with [...] "Where the Magic Begins") {{that he has been}} building, which he has placed at the family's {{favorite}} spot at a nearby lake where he and Faith first kissed. Later, when the family arrives at the lake, there's a Christmas card on the bench addressed to Faith. After looking at the photos that Cody has included of her and Cody, she sees a handwritten note, which she reads aloud. In the note, Cody confesses his love for Faith, and says goodbye. After reading this, <b>she</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> Luke, who, unbeknownst to her, has [...] "had a plan" [...] about her and Cody all along, and asks him whether it was her letter that brought Cody to Nevada City, to which Luke answers: no, you did. Faith realizes that she needs to find Cody, to which Luke adds that he has an idea where Cody may have gone before leaving town. In the movie's final scene, Faith finds Cody at the local Vietnam War veterans' memorial. She chastises him for not saying goodbye, but before she can complete the sentence he kisses her, and she embraces him as the camera pans away; the implication being that they will likely marry after all.|$|E
5000|$|In the meantime, Tony arrives {{home with}} Melissa. On hearing the shower in his bedroom, she wonders {{who could be}} using it. Tony doesn't know...until he sees the duffel bag with the bottle {{sticking}} out nearby. He tries to shove Melissa out, but it's too late - Jeannie appears in his bedroom doorway, clad only in his shirt. Naturally, Melissa doesn't believe Tony's explanation that [...] "she's not a girl", yelling, [...] "It's a GIRL!!", as she storms out. Tony insists that Jeannie leave, but she won't. [...] "Thou hast set me free. That means that I am free to please thee", she explains. [...] "And I am going to please thee very much...". He finally has to trick her back into her bottle {{to get her out}} of the house. Before he can release her outside, a car with Gen. Stone, Dr. Bellows, and Tony's fellow astronauts, Capt. Roger Healey (Bill Daily) and Lt. Pete Conway (Don Dubbins), pulls up. Tony quickly dumps the bottle into a nearby garbage can as they approach him. Bellows brings up the matter of Tony's hallucination, claiming he can't reinstate him for active duty until he's certain he's [...] "completely normal". While Tony tries to convince them he is normal, a garbage truck pulls up, and the contents of the can are dumped into it - along with Jeannie's bottle. In a panic, Tony quickly races to the truck, offers the garbage men $10 for the contents, and fishes out the bottle. Bellows and the others gently steer Tony back into his house, convinced he isn't normal. He tries to coax Jeannie out of the bottle to prove her existence, but she won't budge. Just as Dr. Bellows is about to phone for an ambulance, Tony suddenly giggles, telling them the whole incident was [...] "just a gag", that he was just getting back at Roger and Pete for what they did to him while in training. [...] "You really had me worried, Tony", Gen. Stone nods, accepting his explanation. [...] "I wouldn't want a son-in-law who went around seeing genies, would I?". Tony nervously agrees, as they leave, allowing him to rest after the long day he's had. But it's not over for him, as Jeannie smokes out of her bottle, boiling mad {"I trusted thee! What manner of master art thou??"}. Tony tries to explain that she's not part of the air force, and [...] "there's just no room for you in my life". But after floating in the air next to Jeannie, his living room briefly transformed by her into a sultan's den (complete with exotic furniture and dancing girls) — just as Gen. Stone and Melissa arrive — his nervousness as Jeannie takes on Melissa's appearance and mimics Melissa's every move and word {"Get out of that dress", Tony hisses to Jeannie, as Melissa gasps, [...] "What??"}, her passionate kiss after the Stones leave, and his insistence that she disappear from his life by the time he wakes up in the morning, Jeannie makes it quite clear she's not leaving. After he chases her out of his bedroom when she tries to sneak under the locked door as smoke, <b>she</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> us...and blinks the picture off. The episode is over, but not the battle of the sexes between her and Tony, as he reluctantly accepts the fact he's now [...] "master" [...] of a beautiful but stubborn genie who knows what's best for him.|$|E

She stops to pose a ques-tion, “What does popularity mean? ” The room is silent {{for a few moments}} as the 9 - and 10 -year-olds put their minds to work. Antonio, a student known more for the frequency of his answers than their accuracy, raises his hand. “It’s like something about the president. ” “OK,” Ms. Jenkins notes. “Can anyone add to what Antonio said?” Ms. Jenkins faces a sea of furrowed brows and blank stares. <b>She</b> <b>glances</b> <b>at</b> {{the clock on the wall}} and begins to wonder if they will make it through the text before lunch. After a long silence, Brenda responds. “It’s what the people think about the President, like how much they like him, ” she suggests. “Great, Brenda. You’re right, how did you figure that out?” “Well, ” Brenda pauses. “I looked at it for a while, trying to find a word inside it that I do know like you told us to do last week—and I found the word popular. A pop-ular kid is, you know, a kid that people like, so I fig-ured that popularity must have to do with that. ” “Good work, Brenda, in attacking that word to find a part that you know.
