40|$|According to the 2006 <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> of Belgian enterprises, {{employment}} {{on average}} increased by 1. 3 p. c. between 2005 and 2006. It expanded mainly in {{small and medium-sized}} enterprises while remaining unchanged in large companies. Employment grew in all branches of activity except in industry. A marked rise was recorded in the number of part-time workers, too. Consequently, the part-time employment rate increased again, the rise being especially strong for the male workforce. Staff movements were larger than in 2005, but net recruitment fell to only half of the previous year’s level. A strong increase in the staff turnover rate was observed in some industrial branches. Hourly labour costs rose by an average of 3. 1 p. c. between 2005 and 2006, to 33. 1 euro. Their level differs significantly between enterprises according to their branch of activity and their size. Labour costs are higher in enterprises operating in several regions than in single-region firms. In the latter, hourly labour costs are weaker in Wallonia than in the two other regions. Performance in the field of training still fell well short of the targets of 1. 9 p. c. in 2006 for the financial effort indicator and 50 p. c. by 2010 for the employee participation rate. The first indicator, that is, the training budget as a percentage of staff costs, was estimated at 1. 2 p. c. in 2006. There was a further but small increase in the rate of employee participation in training : only 36. 4 p. c. of workers had access to training in 2006. In Wallonia, the percentage of training firms is lower and the indicators calculated solely for training firms remain systematically weaker than in Brussels and Flanders. Finally, the Belgian results of the Continuing Vocational Training Survey (CVTS) for 2005 were compared with those of the <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets.</b> The proportion of training firms is far higher in CVTS, probably because of the intensive follow-up provided to firms involved in the survey. On the other hand, the worker participation rate and the time spent on training as a percentage of working hours are similar in both statistics. As for the financial effort indicator, the results are very different, respectively 1. 6 p. c. in CVTS and 1. 3 p. c. in the <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets,</b> while they were quite similar in 1999 when the previous survey was carried out. employment, staff costs, training, working hours, employment contract, full-time, part-time, skills, temporary worker...|$|R

40|$|There was {{an average}} annual {{increase}} in employment of 1. 7 p. c. in 2008, according to the statistics gleaned from a reduced population of enterprises that filed their <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> by 16 September 2009 at the latest. End-of-year results (+ 0. 8 p. c.) point to a significant slowdown in growth {{during the course of}} the year, reflecting the economic downturn which began at the end of 2007. Full-time staff numbers stabilised, but the number of part-time workers continued to grow. The expansion of this part-time working arrangement is not only attributable to the recruitment of workers on shorter hours; shifts between full-time and part-time working arrangements have also been observed, especially in large firms that have restructured. As a result of the economic downturn, the share of temporary work has fallen. In firms filing a full-format <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet,</b> a reduction in the use of temporary agency workers has also been noted. The overall wage bill in the firms included in the reduced population grew by 5. 3 p. c. in 2008. At the same time, the volume of labour expanded by 1. 6 p. c., so that costs per hour worked increased by 3. 7 p. c. on average. This article includes an assessment, by branch of activity, of how closely the indicative wage norm set for the period 2006 - 2008 has been followed. This survey was carried out on the basis of a population of firms that had filed a <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> for the three consecutive years. For the first time ever, thanks to the introduction of a new version of the <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet,</b> it has been possible to have a breakdown of staff numbers by educational level. On average, women tend to have a more intensive level of training than men. Workers’ educational requirements vary considerably according to the branch of activity. Since the year 2008, training activities have been broken down between formal and informal vocational training and initial training, whereas before only formal training and a very small proportion of informal training had been taken into account. Participation rates for these three types of training come to respectively 37, 21 and 1 p. c. of the workforce. Budgets for training accounted for a total of 1. 7 p. c. of staff expenses, including 1. 2 p. c. for formal training alone, which is still well below the target for the private sector that had been set at 1. 9 p. c. for 2006. Major differences in training policy can be observed in firms classified by size and branch of activity, whether it is a question of ranging from the volume of training activities, the size of budget, or type of training selected. An analysis of individual data shows that the probability for an enterprise to provide formal or informal training depends above all on its size, with the branch of activity ranking second. Whether it is linked to a non-resident firm and the composition of the workforce (notably the relative share of staff with higher education qualifications) also play a significant role. Within firms that do offer training, the dispersion of training costs depends very much on firm-specific factors, which cannot be taken into consideration by a general model. employment, staff costs, training, working hours, employment contract, full-time, part-time, skills, temporary worker...|$|E

40|$|Each year, in the 4 th quarter’s Economic Review, the National Bank {{examines}} the provisional {{results of the}} <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets.</b> As all the <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> are not yet available for 2004, the study {{is based on a}} limited population of enterprises, compiled according to the principle of a constant sample. This population is made up of 38, 530 enterprises employing around 1, 331, 000 workers in 2004. The main results of the analysis, in terms of employment, working hours, labour cost and training, are as follows. Employment in the enterprises of the limited population increased by 0. 3 p. c. on average between 2003 and 2004. The rise recorded {{at the end of the}} year is slightly higher, which points to an improvement in the course of the year. The growth of employment was particularly strong in the companies employing less than 50 full-time equivalents, whereas employment diminished in those employing over 250 workers. The health and social sector and construction proved to be most dynamic, whereas industry continued to reduce its staff. As usual, the improvement in the economic climate first translated in an increased use of more flexible working schemes : the downward trend recorded for some years in the share of fixed term employment contracts stopped and the enterprises filing full-format <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> revealed a sharp rise of work by temporary employment agency staff. However, there were still major differences between the various branches of activity as to the way they resort to those instruments. The adjustment of the production capacity to the growth in economic activity also showed in the increase in the average working hours. Thus, a rise was recorded for the number of full-time workers, i. e. a break with the downward trend observed since 1998. In some large enterprises, however, end-of-career workers benefited from extra days off, which affected average working hours. A new extension of the working hours of part-time workers was also recorded. In parallel, the share of part-time employment contracts increased significantly. The article stresses the differences between small and large enterprises and between the various branches of activity in the breakdown of workers by working scheme. Thus, in the small enterprises, which are particularly dynamic in job creation, the rise of part-time work mainly results from new engagements. In the large enterprises, on the other hand, it primarily results from the transition from full-time jobs to part-time jobs. The full-format <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> data allow to analyse some characteristics of the staff movements. The net inflow of workers has been broken down by their level of training and the gross outflow of workers by the reason for their leaving their job. In those areas as well, the enterprises show major differences according to their size and their branch of activity. Staff costs per hour worked increased by 1. 9 p. c. on average between 2003 and 2004. The rise was slightly more marked for full-time workers. According to the results of an analysis based on a constant limited population over the period 2002 - 2004, the indicative wage norm of 5. 4 p. c. was respected in most branches of activity, even though a rise exceeding that norm was observed in half of those enterprises. Finally, in spite of the concerns expressed by European and Belgian authorities, the formal training indicators again showed a drop in 2004, except for the participation rate. Especially the cost indicator, which relates the training budget to overall staff expenses, again fell, thus moving even further away from the 1, 9 p. c. objective set in the successive central agreements signed since 1998. employment, staff costs, training, working hours, employment contract, full-time, part-time, skills, temporary worker...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{economic}} recession on employment {{is reflected in the}} information gleaned from <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> filed for the year 2009. Staff numbers were down by 1. 2 p. c. compared with 31 December 2008, which is more than double the average annual decline. As evidence of the use that firms have made of the various flexibility instruments available to help reduce the volume of labour, part-time employment increased in 2009, at the expense of full-time jobs, mainly because of the shift from full-time work schedules towards shorter working hours. Job losses took a proportionally higher toll on men than on women, and manual workers have been affected more than employees or management staff. Large enterprises had to face more staff cuts than SMEs. Among the different branches of activity, job losses were the heaviest in industry, followed by the financial services and insurance sector. Some job creation was still observed in certain branches, including health and social work. Workers affected by temporary lay-offs for economic reasons and by the crisis measures remain on their employer’s staff register, which has tended to limit the drop in the number of workers in employment, while the volume of hours worked, which is directly influenced by these measures, felt considerably in 2009. Combined with this decline, the increase with 3. 8 p. c. of the average hourly labour costs led to an increase in staff costs of barely half a percentage point. Despite a {{rise in the number of}} training firms, budgets for both formal and informal training were revised downwards in 2009. In all, firms devoted 1. 63 p. c. of staff costs to training their workers, compared with 1. 72 p. c. a year earlier, a contraction that reflects the pro-cyclical nature of this expenditure.

In Flanders, the contraction of employment in trade and transport, information and communication, and especially industry was counterbalanced by the expansion in the health sector. In 2010, firms invested more in formal and informal training for their workers, who also participated in such training in greater numbers. Conversely, both the amount spent and the number of participants were in decline in the case of initial training (alternating study and work experience) – which remains marginal. Firms operating in more than one Region are considerably larger than the average and proportionately more numerous to report training activities in their <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet.</b> Moreover, there are evident differences in training policy between firms located exclusively in Brussels, Flanders or Wallonia. The health and social work branch, which has been growing steadily for a number of years, was analysed separately. Over half of the workers in this sector, of whom 80 % are female, work part-time. The percentage of temporary contracts is above the average, and substitution contracts account for a third of them. Conversely, agency work is less common. The level of staff costs varies considerably within this branch, while remaining below the average. Finally, workers in the health and social work branch have broad access to training, but the training provided is less expensive and of shorter duration than in other branches of activity. employment, health and social work, <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet,</b> staff costs, training, employment contract, full-time, part-time, temporary worker...|$|E
40|$|Each year, the National Bank {{examines}} the provisional {{results of the}} <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> of Belgian enterprises. As the <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> are not yet all available for 2005, the study {{is based on a}} limited population of enterprises, compiled according to the principle of a constant sample. This population is made up of 48, 976 enterprises employing around 4, 441, 000 workers in 2005. The main results of the analysis are as follows. As an average, employment increased by 0. 5 p. c. between 2004 and 2005. Although the year-end growth rate was also 0. 5 p. c. for these two years, the rate of increase in the volume of labour expressed in full-time equivalent slowed down during the year. Net staff recruitment also declined during 2005, falling to only half the previous year’s level. In fact, employment expanded in small and medium-sized enterprises while large companies recorded staff cuts. In industry, the workforce contracted once again. It remained stable in trade, transport and communications whereas it increased in the other branches, especially in other services and construction. The female workforce grew by around 8, 400 units between year-end 2004 and 2005, representing 37. 7 p. c. of total employment at 31 December 2005; the number of male employees declined by around 1, 400 units. Net staff recruitment is proportionately greater for full-time workers. However, because of the changes in the working arrangements of existing staff, the rate of part-time working increased by almost 4 p. c. Part of this rise is due {{to the development of the}} time credit scheme, increasingly used to reconcile work and family life, but also to facilitate the transition between working life and retirement. Enterprises filing full-format accounts supply more details on staff movements during the year. There has been an increase in the number of workers with higher education qualifications, while the number of staff with low and medium skills has declined. However the majority of the workers taken on still fall into these last categories of staff. New part-time employees have lower qualifications than those recruited as full-time staff. The male full-time workers recruited are on average less skilled than new female full-time workers. Despite the large net intake of temporary workers, the total for the latter varies only very slightly, since some of these workers are offered a permanent contract while other temporary jobs are subject to a high rate of turnover. However, the turnover of employees on permanent contracts is also quite significant, since 12. 8 p. c. of them left their employer in 2005. Finally, the number of staff leaving declined between 2004 and 2005, mainly because of a reduction in the use of early retirement schemes and redundancies. The full-format accounts also contain information on the use of agency workers and persons on secondment from an outside firm. It is therefore possible to assess the relative importance of all temporary contracts which, in these companies, altogether represent 9. 2 p. c. of workers. Small organisations use more agency workers, while larger ones prefer fixed-term contracts. Manufacturing industry and the construction sector use primarily agency workers while the service branches make more use of fixed-term contracts. Persons on secondment and substitution contracts are found mainly in the service branches. Hourly labour costs increased by an average of 3. 6 p. c. between 2004 and 2005 in enterprises of the limited population. The article shows that, while the level of hourly labour costs differs significantly between branches, the dispersion of these costs is also considerable : the ratio between the average costs recorded in firms with the lowest costs and the average calculated for those with the highest costs varies by a factor of 2 to 5 between branches. Finally, in regard to training, the financial effort indicator declined once again in 2005. The training budget is estimated to be 1. 05 p. c. of staff costs in 2005, against 1. 13 p. c. in 2004 and a peak of 1. 42 p. c. in 2000. However, there was a slight increase in the rate of employees’ participation in training : 36 p. c. of workers had access to training in 2005, one percentage point more than at the beginning of the decade. These performances still fall well short of the targets set by the inter-generation solidarity pact adopted at the end of December 2005, which – in line with earlier agreements – stipulates that the first indicator should reach 1. 9 p. c. in 2006 and the second 50 p. c. by 2010. employment, staff costs, training, working hours, employment contract, full-time, part-time, skills, temporary worker...|$|R

The method chosen was the descriptive research to obtain results in a qualitative approach for the problem. The technical procedure used was documentary research. Data was collected over the <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> released by several companies’ websites between 2009 and 2010. In the Northeast region, the companies Companhia de Eletricidade do Estado da Bahia (COELBA), Companhia Energética de Pernambuco (CELPE) and Companhia Energética do Rio Grande do Norte (COSERN) had {{the highest levels of}} social disclosure. COELBA, for example, obtained the maximum score according to the score methodology proposed by the paper. Coming from the South area, the best ranked was Companhia Paranaense de Energia (COPEL), from Paraná state, which disclosed 99 % of the information analyzed in this study. Average level of disclosure of companies by region remained practically stable between the years 2009 and 2010. In general, companies located in the Northeast region evidenced a higher percentage of social and environmental information compared to companies of South region. </p...|$|E

The Flemish maritime ports (Antwerp, Ghent, Ostend, Zeebrugge), the Autonomous Port of Li 8 ge and the port of Brussels {{play a major role}} in their respective regional economies and in the Belgian economy, not only in terms of industrial activity but also as intermodal centers facilitating the commodity flow. This update paper 1 provides an extensive overview of the economic importance and development of the Flemish maritime ports, the Li 8 ge port complex and the port of Brussels for the period 2009 - 2014, with an emphasis on 2014. Focusing on the three major variables of value added, employment and investment, the report also provides some information based on the <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> and an overview of the financial situation in these ports as a whole. These observations are linked to a more general context, along with a few cargo statistics. Annual accounts data from the Central Balance Sheet Office were used for the calculation of direct effects, the study of financial ratios and the analysis of the <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet.</b> The indirect effects of the activities concerned were estimated in terms of value added and employment, on the basis of data from the National Accounts Institute. As a result of the underlying calculation method the changes of indirect employment and indirect value added can differ from one another. The developments concerning economic activity in the six ports in 2013 - 2014 are summarised in the table on the next page: In 2014 the growth of maritime traffic in the Flemish sea ports was once again due solely to developments in the port of Antwerp. However, that did not necessarily mean that direct value added followed the same trend: except for the port of Zeebrugge, all other lemish ports recorded an increase. Direct employment is continuing to decline, except in the port of Ghent where it remains steady. Investment appears to be picking up, after last year 2 ̆ 019 s weak figures. Cargo traffic in the ports of Li 8 ge and Brussels was up in 2014, but that did not result in any increase in value added. The decline in direct employment also persisted, certainly in the port of Li 8 ge. This report provides a comprehensive account of these issues, giving details for each economic sector, although the comments are confined to the main changes that occurred in 2014.

40|$|According to {{the results}} of the <b>social</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> {{available}} in September 2008, employment rose by 2. 3 p. c. in 2007. The increase concerned both full-time as well as part-time workers. The rise in part-time working is only partially explained by the hiring of part-time workers : this year again, medium-sized and large enterprises also saw numerous changes in working arrangements. Although women still account for the bulk of part-time workers, the increase in the part-time rate was greater for men than for women. The analysis shows that part-time working is spread unevenly in the various branches of activity. As in previous years, the article studies staff movements and the characteristics of workers joining and leaving companies filing full-format accounts. It also examines reasons for leaving and the external turnover of workers by comparing the results from the various groups of enterprises categorised according to their size or their branch of activity. The analysis also highlights the further advance in 2007 of temporary employment contracts – whose proportion is tending to become more uniform in the various categories of company size – and the increased use of agency work in companies filing full-format accounts. Recourse to these contracts as instruments for workforce adjustments varies considerably from one branch of activity to the other. The total wage bill rose by 5. 1 p. c. between 2006 and 2007 in the reduced population of companies. Over the same period there was a 2. 3 p. c. {{growth in the number of}} hours worked, so that hourly labour costs grew by 2. 8 p. c. on average. The rise was more pronounced for full-time than for part-time workers. Major differences in levels are still discernible in terms of hourly costs, depending on the size and branch of activity of the companies. In terms of training, the results for 2006 still fall well short of the set targets : training costs accounted for 1. 17 p. c. of the total wage bill whereas the target specified in the Generation Pact for this same year was 1. 9 p. c. At the same time, the participation rate in training was only 35. 2 p. c. whereas a target has been set of 50 p. c. by 2010. Growth was nevertheless recorded between 2006 and 2007 within a favourable economic context : the cost indicator for training grew by 4 p. c. and the participation rate by 0. 2 p. c. If these increases were applied to the level observed in 2006, these same indicators should amount to 1. 22 and 35. 3 p. c. respectively for 2007. employment, staff costs, training, working hours, employment contract, full-time, part-time, skills, temporary worker...|$|R
