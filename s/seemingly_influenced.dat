2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the heavily distorted instruments and gritty industrial sounds of their previous album, The Downward Spiral, The Fragile relies more on soundscapes, electronic beats, ambient noise, rock-laden guitar, and the usage of melodies as harmonies. Several critics noted that the album was <b>seemingly</b> <b>influenced</b> by progressive rock, art rock, electronica, and avant-garde music. It is categorized as an art rock album by The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Edna Gundersen of USA Today, and Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly. Hermes views that, like [...] "art-rockers" [...] King Crimson and David Bowie, Reznor incorporates elements of 20th-century classical music on the album, [...] "mixing prepared piano melodies à la John Cage with thematic flavor from Claude Debussy". Music journalist Ann Powers observes elements of progressive rock bands King Crimson and Roxy Music, Reznor's influences, and the experimentation of electronica artists such as Autechre and Squarepusher, and writes that The Fragile uses funk bass lines, North African minor-key modalities, and the treatment of tonality by Symbolist composers like Debussy. The album also features several distorted guitar parts which Powers suggests that fans can enjoy. Rob Sheffield observes a [...] "prog-rock vibe" [...] akin to Pink Floyd's 1979 album The Wall and feels that The Fragile is similarly [...] "a double album that vents ... alienation and misery into paranoid studio hallucinations, each track crammed with overdubs until there's no breathing room".|$|E

In 2005, the album was ranked number 382 in Rock Hard magazine's book The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time.|$|E
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notorious {{depiction}} of the consumption of monkey's brains is from the 1978 mondo film Faces of Death, directed by John Alan Schwartz. The scene depicts a restaurant with a Middle Eastern theme, including harem dancers, where American tourists are seated around a specially-designed table. A server brings out a live monkey which is enclosed in a central cage {{in such a manner}} that its head is all that is exposed. Hammers are then distributed to the restaurant patrons, who proceed to hit the monkey in the head until it dies. The server then cuts open the skull and removes the monkey's brains directly onto the plates of the customers. Like many other scenes in the film, Schwartz has admitted that the scene was faked. The hammers were foam (so as not to harm the actual monkey involved) while the 'monkey head' was actually filled with gelatin, red food coloring, and cauliflower simulating the brain. Additional depictions from films released in the decade following Faces of Death were <b>seemingly</b> <b>influenced</b> by the scene, including the 1984 film Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and the 1985 comedy film Clue. Beyond Faces of Death's intent on shock value in keeping with its status as a mondo film, what the scenes mostly have in common are their representations of Orientalism, which according to author Sophia Rose Arjana are meant to [...] "conflate bizarre and vulgarized representations of the Far East" [...] in order to disseminate a narrative on the [...] "dangers that non-Christians pose to 'civilized' Westerners." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of Brentano on {{the emergence of}} Husserl's notion of intentionality has been usually perceived as the key of understanding the history of intentionality, since Brentano was credited {{with the discovery of}} intentionality, and Husserl was his discipline. This much debated question is to be revisited in the present essay by incorporating recent advances in Brentano scholarship and by focusing on Husserl's very first work, his habilitation essay (Über den Begriff der Zahl), which followed immediately after his study years at Brentano, and also on manuscript notes from the same period. It is to be shown that (i) although Brentano failed to enact a direct influence on Husserl's notion of intentionality (much in line with K. Schuhmann's claim), (ii) yet the core of Brentano's notion remained operative in Husserl's theory of relations, which is <b>seemingly</b> <b>influenced</b> by John Stuart Mill and Hermann Lotze. This investigation is intended as a contribution towards the proper understanding of the complexities of Husserl's early philosophy...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the self-perception of {{patients}} toward their dental appearance using the aesthetic component (AC) of index of orthodontic treatment need (IOTN) index and whether age and gender had any influence on it. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out to assess the perceived esthetic impact of malocclusion in 16 - 24 year-old subjects selected from the rural population of Faridabad, Haryana, India. The sample was divided into two groups, older adolescents and younger adults, and the AC of the IOTN index was applied. Results: The results showed that most subjects scored themselves as having an attractive dentition with no need for orthodontic treatment (60. 91 %). Gender-wise differences were not found to be statistically significant in relation to the perceived needs (P = 0. 095), whereas age-wise differences were found to be statistically significant in relation to the perceived needs (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: While the age seemed to have an impact on the perceived esthetic impact of malocclusion, the gender did not <b>seemingly</b> <b>influence</b> this self-perception...|$|R

30|$|While F 2 F {{collaboration}} typically has undeniable {{impact on}} learning experience, research, for example: (Swan, Shen, & Hiltz 2006; Strijbos, 2011), {{have found that}} the students consider online collaboration more autonomous than F 2 F collaboration due to the equal opportunity it presents to all the students for expressing opinions or asking questions about certain contents. Besides this, online collaboration provides the students with an opportunity to foster certain diligence and deliberation about their peer’s contribution (e.g. feedback or questions) about a lecture while they are developing their own comments (Richardson & Swan, 2003). Research, for example: (Swan et al., 2006), about the impact of online collaboration stipulates that the aspect in which the students apprehend the role of their colleagues, perceive their social presence and foster certain feelings for the collaborating community, <b>seemingly</b> <b>influences</b> the learning activity.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between reputational rankings {{of political science}} departments and their scholarly productivity remains a source of discussion and controversy. After the National Research Council (1995) published its ranking of 98 political science departments, Katz and Eagles (1996), Jackman and Siverson (1996), and Lowry and Silver (1996) analyzed the factors that <b>seemingly</b> <b>influenced</b> those rankings. Miller, Tien, and Peebler (1996) offered an alternate approach to ranking departments, based both upon the number of faculty (and their graduates) who published in the American Political Science Review and upon the number of citations that faculty members received. More recently, two studies have examined departmental rankings in other ways. Ballard and Mitchell (1998) assessed political science departments by evaluating the level of productivity in nine important disciplinary and subfield journals, and Garand and Graddy (1999) evaluated the impact of journal publications (and other variables) on the rankings of political science departments. In general, Miller, Tien, and Peebler found {{a high level of}} correspondence between reputation rankings and productivity, Ballard and Mitchell did not, and Garand and Graddy found that publications in “high impact” journals were important for departmental rankings...|$|E
40|$|The sudden {{changes of}} {{variations}} in the environmental and climatic patterns in an area always cause certain undesirable and unforeseen events as well as problems. Immediately after the first monsoon rains, in {{the third week of}} June, an instance of mass mortality of fishes and clams was reported from the Vembanad Lake. The report indicated that large scale mortality of several groups of aquatic organisms were occurring mainly in the southern half of the lake. The unusual phenomena might have been caused by soil acidity. Hydrogen-ion concentration of the water showed that it was in acid range. The data revealed that the effect of pH reduction <b>seemingly</b> <b>influenced</b> the eco-system only up {{to the middle of the}} lake and coming towards the mouth of the estuary the effect appeared to have got neutralized, probably due to the regular tidal action.

30|$|Consequently, as Dillenbourg et al. (2016) {{pointed out}} about {{collaborative}} learning in general, the tasks are primarily designed to facilitate shared meaning and collaboration. In the CPS construct examined here, the tasks, even though being primarily {{designed to measure}} individual student’s CPS skills in a collaborative situation, cannot be successfully completed without the pair (e.g. Care et al. 2015, 2016; Hesse et al. 2015; Scoular et al. 2017). However, collaborative activity and learning {{should not be considered}} something that would automatically happen: despite the similar tasks and equal support provided for the participants, the pedagogical designs can be perceived and interpreted differently by different participants (e.g. Arvaja and Pöysä-Tarhonen 2013; Simpson et al. 2017; Sinha et al. 2015). For example, the degree of shared understanding that the pairs needed to reach was related to the type of task they needed to perform (Dillenbourg et al. 2016). In case 1, the symmetry of the resources available for the pairs might have diluted the effect of interdependence. In case 2 (Olive Oil), in turn, the asymmetry of the task activated positive interaction patterns, such as shared negotiations and true acts of collaboration, as expected from this style of task to ensure the removal of, but not guaranteeing, unbalanced interactions. In line with the findings of Simpson et al. (2017), this <b>seemingly</b> <b>influenced</b> the performance and productivity of pair 29.|$|E

40|$|Becoming Turkish is {{a social}} history of the {{nationalist}} reforms implemented in the early Turkish Republic from {{the birth of the}} state in 1923 through the establishment of a two party system of government in 1945. The author presents the personal experiences of a wide array of Turkish citizens and their varied perceptions, evolving ideas, and utilitarian coping mechanisms formed in response to Kemalist reforms. In addition, she shows the agency of citizenship through primary sources such as petitions and letters that <b>seemingly</b> <b>influenced</b> government decisions. Not focusing on the resistance or suppression of the Kemalist reforms, Yılmaz employs oral histories, letters, and archival data to reveal diverse reactions that did not simply fall into two polarizing choices of brutal resistance or absolute acceptance. The uneven and incomplete way in which new Turkish citizens experienced and perceived the four areas of reform detailed by Yılmaz was mirrored by legislative and governmental inconsistencies in the implementation and interpretation of these laws. The four reforms used to explore “state-society relations” in the early Turkish Republic include: “men’s clothing, women’s clothing, language, and national celebrations. ” The author exemplifies how Turks from various economic, cultural, and demographic categories converged with the state in “meeting grounds” and how “dialogue between the state and society” shows a true reflection of how Turks lived and experienced these reforms...|$|E

Methodology The research was based on qualitative research and utilised an interpretive qualitative approach within a phenomenological framework. Data was collected through 12 semi-structured interviews with clients, BCNs and radiology staff working in a BSAC. Analysis of the interview data utilised a method of Inductive Thematic Analysis. Findings and discussion Five categories were generated from the data, ‘Person Centred Care’, ‘Interactional Support’, ‘Defining the Role’, ‘Organisational Issues’ and ‘Clinical Practice/New Opportunities’. Views and experiences from each participant were considered within the context of these themes. The findings of this study recognised the proficiency of the BCN in their communication skills and provision of psychological support. However, role ambiguity and organisational issues appear to impact on BCN performance within this setting. There are various reasons for this, including lack of role definition, service limitations, team dynamics and effective team working. Role development is <b>seemingly</b> <b>influenced</b> by individual BCN perception of the scope of the role, level of experience and educational requirements.

40|$|Processing-structure-property {{relationships}} were developed for several popular, soft biomedical polymers under fatigue loading {{to assist in}} the use and success of such polymers in load-bearing orthopedic applications. Results demonstrated that materials with sufficient energy dissipation at the testing temperature, such as polycarbonate urethane (PCU), resisted fatigue fracture under cyclic compressive loading however also demonstrated cyclic ratcheting. Bovine meniscal tissue demonstrated similar ratcheting behavior with a lack of fatigue fracture. Further studies on PCU demonstrated an increase in monotonic stiffness, shear failure stress, and improvements in tensile fatigue from a stress-based standpoint with increasing hard segment content. Effects of hard segment content on tensile failure strain, and strain-based fatigue performance, were more complex and <b>seemingly</b> <b>influenced</b> by interaction between phases. Results demonstrated that the fused deposition modeling (FDM) printing process is a very effective processing method for PCU as printed samples matched or exceeded injection molded samples in terms of monotonic tension, compression, shear, and tensile fatigue performance. Lastly, the effects of printed architecture on fatigue performance were examined for FDM PCU as well as an elastomeric polyurethane (EPU) printed via continuous liquid interface production. Results indicated that both materials were relatively tolerant of architectures and notches. Introduction of porosity led to a decrease in tensile failure stress based on gross area as expected, without a significant effect on tensile failure strain. Effects on fatigue performance were small and were found to be dependent on notch severity, with the largest effects in the high cycle regime. Ph. D...|$|E
