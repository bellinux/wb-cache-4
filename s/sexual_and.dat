40|$|The {{agreement}} of subjective <b>and</b> genital <b>sexual</b> response, {{also referred to}} as sexual concordance, shows substantial variability between women. Identifying predictors of <b>sexual</b> arousal <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> concordance is important to improve our understanding of female <b>sexual</b> response <b>and</b> its relationship to sexual function or dysfunction. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the relevance of <b>sexual</b> excitation <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> inhibition as predictors of subjective sexual arousal, genital arousal, <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> concordance. In a laboratory setting, sexual arousal was induced by erotic video stimuli. Subjective sexual arousal was assessed continuously during stimulus presentation and genital arousal was measured with vaginal photoplethysmography. Data of 58 women (M age = 24. 95, SD = 4. 65) were analyzed using multilevel analyses (HLM). This data analytic technique estimates the within-subject associations of subjective and genital arousal, by controlling for between-subject differences. An interaction term of <b>sexual</b> excitation <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> inhibition significantly predicted genital sexual arousal. In exploratory analyses, two lower order factors of sexual inhibition (Concerns about <b>Sexual</b> Function <b>and</b> Arousal Contingency) were predictive of sexual concordance. Further examination of these associations might increase our knowledge of female <b>sexual</b> function <b>and</b> deepen our understanding of how <b>sexual</b> excitation <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> inhibition affect <b>sexual</b> arousal <b>and</b> consequently, impact <b>sexual</b> behaviors, in women...|$|R

The current 3 studies examined the etiology <b>and</b> reduction of <b>sexual</b> assault <b>and</b> re-assault on college campuses among women. Study 1 was a prospective assessment of the use of sexual assault protective behavioral strategies (PBS) on subsequent <b>sexual</b> assault incidence <b>and</b> severity. The use of sexual assault PBS at Time 1 was associated with less <b>sexual</b> assault incidence <b>and</b> severity at Time 2. Study 2 furthered this by examining the relationship between sexual assault PBS, drinking PBS, <b>sexual</b> assault, <b>and</b> re-assault. Both <b>sexual</b> assault PBS <b>and</b> drinking PBS were associated with <b>sexual</b> assault <b>and</b> re-assault in college. Study 3 was a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of a combined intervention targeting both <b>sexual</b> assault risk <b>and</b> alcohol use in college women to reduce <b>sexual</b> assault <b>and</b> re-assault.

5|$|Ascocoryne sarcoides is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Helotiaceae. The species name {{is derived from the}} Greek sarkodes (fleshy). Formerly known as Coryne sarcoides, its taxonomical history has been {{complicated}} by the fact that it may adopt both <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> asexual forms. Colloquially known as jelly drops or the purple jellydisc, this common fungus appears as a gelatinous mass of pinkish or purple-colored discs. Distributed widely in North America, Europe and Asia, A.sarcoides is a saprobic fungus and grows in clusters on the trunks and branches of a variety of dead woods. Field studies suggest that colonization by A.sarcoides of the heartwood of black spruce confers some resistance to further infection by rot-causing fungi. A.sarcoides contains the antibiotic compound ascocorynin, shown in the laboratory to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E

There was not a significant difference between general assertiveness scores in males and females, nor did gender role (either more or less traditional) have an effect on sexual assertiveness. Previous research supports the importance of this study as sexual satisfaction is connected to overall relational satisfaction and relationships in which assertive communication is used tend to be more satisfied. ...|$|R

5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E
5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to young people, {{who are at}} a peak in their <b>sexual</b> <b>and</b> reproductive lives. Yet the importance of sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury. People who are able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better overall quality of life.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{provided}} a novel {{consideration of the}} relations between alcohol consumption, <b>sexual</b> objectification, <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> violence, because evidence for the links between <b>sexual</b> objectification <b>and</b> alcohol consumption as well as objectification <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> violence are almost nonexistent in the published literature. We also developed a measure of interpersonal sexual objectification perpetration (ISOS-P) {{because there are no}} existing self-report measures of this construct. We hypothesized that these variables would be associated positively <b>and</b> that <b>sexual</b> objectification (including evaluating women’s bodies <b>and</b> making <b>sexual</b> advances toward women) would mediate the relation between alcohol use <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> violence. Method: To test these possibilities, undergraduate men completed measures assessing their alcohol use, <b>sexual</b> objectification, <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> violence. Results: Positive relations emerged between alcohol consumption frequency, alcohol consumption quantity, body evaluation, <b>sexual</b> advances, <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> violence. A path analysis revealed that the combined effect of body evaluation <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> advances was a significant mediator of the alcohol quantity <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> violence link. As well, body evaluation was a significant mediator of the alcohol quantity <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> advances link. Conclusion: This study provides a novel contribution to the literature by developing a measure of <b>sexual</b> objectification perpetration <b>and</b> showing that this construct mediates the frequently documented association between heavy drinking <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> violence. These findings have implications for the prevention of alcohol-related sexual assault on college campuses...|$|R
