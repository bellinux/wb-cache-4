25|$|How the {{distinction}} between productive and unproductive labor is drawn obviously has a big mathematical effect on the estimated total profit rate on production, if unproductive labor costs are excluded from the total variable capital outlay, and included {{in the part of}} total net output which represents total <b>surplus</b> <b>value</b> produced. If the proportion of unproductive labor increases, paradoxically the total <b>surplus</b> <b>value</b> will then also increase, with the effect of raising the rate of profit. Prof. Moseley resolves this paradoxical effect by distinguishing between primary and secondary income distributions, and between gross and net <b>surplus</b> <b>value.</b> In his account, first the total net value-added is produced by the productive workers, and then the gross wages of the unproductive workers are deducted from the gross surplus value; in that interpretation, it follows that the larger the wage-bill of unproductive workers is, the lower the netted <b>surplus</b> <b>value</b> will be. Chris Harman noted large quantitative differences in the estimates of unproductive labor by different orthodox Marxists. Moseley's calculations and his definition of unproductive labor have been criticized by other Marxists. The main objections discussed are conceptual and empirical.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{off with}} {{pioneering}} work by Ernest Mandel from 1964, various {{attempts have been}} made to link the long waves of capitalist development to long-term fluctuations in average profitability. Mandel's influential Phd thesis Late Capitalism (in German 1972, English version 1975) was a critical response to Henryk Grossman's theory. Like Henryk Grossman, Mandel was convinced of the centrality of profitability in the trajectory of capitalist development, but Mandel did not believe that Marx's reproduction models could be used to create a theory of capitalist crises. In Grossman's profitability model, there was only a series of business cycles and, sometime after the 34th cycle, a general breakdown of capitalism, because insufficient <b>surplus</b> <b>value</b> was being generated. Leaving aside the issue of the validity of Grossman's model, his picture of capitalist development did not explain historical phases of faster and slower economic growth lasting about 25 years or so. After World War 2, a long boom occurred, instead of a deepening capitalist crisis which many Marxists had expected. That was what Mandel wanted to explain (Mandel's and Grossman's growth models both ignore the accumulation of non-productive capital assets and profits not arising from new surplus-value).|$|E
25|$|Kovel {{uses the}} term “Eco-socialist revolution” to {{describe}} the transition to an eco-socialist world society. In the immediate socio-political transition, he believes that four groups will emerge from the revolution – revolutionaries, those “whose productive activity is directly compatible with ecological production” (such as nurses, schoolteachers, librarians, independent farmers and many other examples), those “whose pre-revolutionary practice was given over to capital” (including the bourgeoisie, advertising executives and more) and “the workers whose activity added <b>surplus</b> <b>value</b> to capitalist commodities”. In terms of political organisation, he advocates an “interim assembly” {{made up of the}} revolutionaries that can “devise incentives to make sure that vital functions are maintained” (such as short-term continuation of “differential remuneration” for labor), “handle the redistribution of social roles and assets”, convene “in widespread locations”, and send delegates to regional, state, national and international organisations, where every level has an “executive council” that is rotated and can be recalled. From there, he asserts that “productive communities” will “form the political as well as economic unit of society” and “organize others” to make a transition to eco-socialist production; he adds that people will be allowed to be members of any community they choose with “associate membership” of others, such as a doctor having main membership of healthcare communities as a doctor and associate membership of child-rearing communities as a father. Each locality would, in Kovel’s eyes, require one community that administered the areas of jurisdiction through an elected assembly. High-level assemblies would have additional “supervisory” roles over localities to monitor the development of ecosystemic integrity, and administer “society-wide services” like transport in “state-like functions”, before the interim assembly can transfer responsibilities to “the level of the society as a whole through appropriate and democratically responsive committees”.|$|E

500|$|The {{successful}} {{sales of}} A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy stimulated Marx {{in the early}} 1860s to finish work on the three large volumes that would compose his major life's work—Das Kapital and the Theories of <b>Surplus</b> <b>Value,</b> which discussed the theoreticians of political economy, particularly Adam Smith and David Ricardo. Theories of <b>Surplus</b> <b>Value</b> {{is often referred to}} as the fourth volume book of Das Kapital and constitutes one of the first comprehensive treatises on the history of economic thought. In 1867, the first volume of Das Kapital was published, a work which analysed the capitalist process of production. Here Marx elaborated his labour theory of value, which had been influenced by Thomas Hodgskin. Marx acknowledged Hodgskin's [...] "admirable work" [...] Labour Defended against the Claims of Capital at more than one point in Capital. Indeed, Marx quoted Hodgskin as recognising the alienation of labour that occurred under modern capitalist production. No longer was there any [...] "natural reward of individual labour. Each labourer produces only some part of a whole, and each part having no value or utility of itself, there is nothing on which the labourer can seize, and say: 'This is my product, this will I keep to myself'". In this first volume of Capital, Marx outlined his conception of <b>surplus</b> <b>value</b> and exploitation, which he argued would ultimately lead to a falling rate of profit and the collapse of industrial capitalism. Demand for a Russian language edition of Capital soon led to the printing of 3,000 copies of the book in the Russian language, which was published on 27 March 1872. By the autumn of 1871, the entire first edition of the German language edition of Capital had been sold out and a second edition was published.|$|E

40|$|In this {{communication}} {{are reported}} the assumptions, methodology, outcomesand conclusions {{of a research}} carried out {{within the scope of}} the revision of the Land,Territorial Ordinance and Urbanism Act, currently under way in Portugal. This is a deeprevision, and it points out the importance of the economic and financial sustainability ofurban development operations for municipalities. Land values rise as a result of territorial planning decisions. Thus a planned publicintervention is required in order to assure these <b>surplus</b> <b>values</b> are allocated for thepopulation¿s social interest. Despite the existence of different kinds of land policies, thefiscal-based ones affect the most the market and land uses, and may substantiallyinfluence planning goals¿ achievement. Land taxation aims at assuring a source of incometo public administration; redistributing welfare so to grant land its social function; givingback to society the land <b>surplus</b> <b>values</b> that accrue from planning decisions and publicinvestments; and increasing the provision of land for urban development. In order to recover part of the <b>surplus</b> <b>values</b> engendered by urban planning decisions,herein is proposed a new territorial management instrument, applied at the Municipallevel. It consists in charging a 20 % fee on the land value increase (surplus-value) thataccrues from concrete building capacity/m 2 assigned by plans to specific urbaninterventions. This fee will, later on, be used by the municipality on behalf of socialpurposes. The current proposal is applied, as a case study, to the Urban DevelopmentPlan of the Planning Unit 11 of the municipality of Lagoa, located in the Algarve(Portugal). The methodology pursued in the current study consists in the computation ofthe building capacity/m 2, and of the <b>surplus</b> <b>values</b> and corresponding 20 % fee thataccrue from the establishment of that plan, to be charged to promoters and builders, inorder to recover part of their unearned increments. This innovative territorialmanagement instrument strengthens municipal¿s economic and financial sustainability,clears up the origins and applications of municipal funds, and ensures that the surplusvalues engendered by plans are pointed to social purposes and not to specific privateinterests. The application of this urban fee may be easily extended to other municipalities, as it isfounded on information and methodologies that stand inter-municipal comparisons.

If businesses could not reach a baseline profitability, they would be driven out of business sooner or later, or they would be taken over by another business and restructured, so that they did become sufficiently profitable. Inversely, if businesses overcharged for their commodities to obtain more profit, fewer people would buy them, and they would suffer decline as well. Marx then examined what the division of the total newly produced <b>surplus</b> <b>value</b> would be, among producers with varying capital compositions, on the assumption of a uniform profit rate established by free competition.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} today in urban development is that of finding the necessary financial resources {{at a time of}} profound crisis of public, national and local finances.

2500|$|Marx {{knew very}} well that a uniform profit rate (a [...] "general profit rate") did not truly exist in the real world, except as a {{tendency}} in the competitive process, as a norm for acceptable returns, or as a statistical average. But he wanted to examine the share-out of newly produced <b>surplus</b> <b>value</b> in its simplest and purest forms, abstracting {{from all kinds of}} variability of circumstances that would make his own calculation extraordinarily complex (see further prices of production). The formation of a normal rate of profit, common to most producers, defined the basic parameters of competition, and thereby it defined the main developmental dynamic of the capitalist production system.|$|E
2500|$|Marx himself famously {{stated in}} chapter 9 of Capital, Volume III {{that he had}} {{previously}} assumed that, to the purchasing capitalist, {{the value of a}} commodity bought was equal to its cost-price. In reality, he argued, this cost-price is itself a market price based on a production price (a cost-price + a profit) of the supplying capitalist producer: the input purchasing price of one capitalist is the output selling price of another capitalist. So the acquisition cost-price of inputs itself corresponded to both a value and a <b>surplus</b> <b>value,</b> and the market prices of inputs might diverge from the labor-value of inputs. [...] Hence, said Marx, if the cost-price of a newly produced output is assumed to be equal to the labor-value of the inputs used up in producing it, [...] "it is always possible to go wrong" [...] in the calculation of the output production price (because input acquisition prices and input labor-values could diverge, given that inputs could be bought above or below their value, and given that their inventory value could change during the production process).|$|E
