50|$|Fee-for-service (FFS) is {{a payment}} model where {{services}} are unbundled {{and paid for}} separately. In health care, it gives an incentive for physicians to provide more treatments because payment {{is dependent on the}} quantity of care, rather than quality of care. Similarly, when patients are shielded from paying (cost-sharing) by health insurance coverage, they are incentivized to welcome any medical service that might do some good. FFS is the dominant physician payment method in the United States, and it raises costs, discourages the efficiencies of integrated care, and a variety of reform efforts have been attempted, recommended, or initiated to reduce its influence (such as moving towards bundled payments and capitation). In capitation, physicians are discouraged from performing procedures, including necessary ones, because they are not paid anything extra for performing them. In the Japanese health care system, FFS is mixed with a nationwide price <b>setting</b> <b>mechanism</b> (all-payer rate setting) to control costs.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an article}} in the May 1970 issue of the Journal of Finance, {{entitled}} [...] "Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work," [...] Fama proposed two concepts that have been used on efficient markets ever since. First, Fama proposed three types of efficiency: (i) strong-form; (ii) semi-strong form; and (iii) weak efficiency. They are explained in the context of what information sets are factored in price trend. In weak form efficiency the information set is just historical prices, which can be predicted from historical price trend; thus, it is impossible to profit from it. Semi-strong form requires that all public information is reflected in prices already, such as companies' announcements or annual earnings figures. Finally, the strong-form concerns all information sets, including private information, are incorporated in price trend; it states no monopolistic information can entail profits, in other words, insider trading cannot make a profit in the strong-form market efficiency world.Second, Fama demonstrated that the notion of market efficiency could not be rejected without an accompanying rejection of the model of market equilibrium (e.g. the price <b>setting</b> <b>mechanism).</b> This concept, known as the [...] "joint hypothesis problem," [...] has ever since vexed researchers. Market efficiency denotes how information is factored in price, Fama (1970) emphasizes that the hypothesis of market efficiency must be tested in the context of expected returns. The joint hypothesis problem states that when a model yields a predicted return significantly different from the actual return, one can never be certain if there exists an imperfection in the model or if the market is inefficient. Researchers can only modify their models by adding different factors to eliminate any anomalies, in hopes of fully explaining the return within the model. The anomaly, also known as alpha in the modeling test, thus functions as a signal to the model maker whether it can perfectly predict returns by the factors in the model. However, as long as there exists an alpha, neither the conclusion of a flawed model nor market inefficiency can be drawn according to the Joint Hypothesis. Fama (1991) also stresses that market efficiency per se is not testable and can only be tested jointly with some model of equilibrium, i.e. an asset-pricing model.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of new C[BOND]H functionalization protocols based on inexpensive cobalt catalysts is currently attracting significant interest. Functionalized 8 -aminoquinoline compounds are high-potential building blocks in organic chemistry and pharmaceutical compounds and new facile routes for their preparation would be highly valuable. Recently, copper has been applied as catalyst for the functionalization of 8 -aminoquinoline compounds and found to operate through a single electron transfer (<b>SET)</b> <b>mechanism,</b> although requiring elevated reaction temperatures. Herein, we described the first example of a cobalt-catalyzed remote C[BOND]H functionalization of 8 -aminoquinoline compounds operating through a <b>SET</b> <b>mechanism,</b> exemplified using a practical and mild nitration protocol. The reaction uses inexpensive cobalt nitrate hexahydrate [Co(NO 3) 2 ⋅ 6 [*]H 2 O] as catalyst and tert-butyl nitrite (TBN) as nitro source.
