5|$|A {{nephew of}} the last Emperor, Constantine XI, Andreas Palaiologos claimed to have {{inherited}} the title of Byzantine Emperor. He lived in the Morea until its fall in 1460, then escaped to Rome where he lived {{under the protection of}} the Papal <b>States</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remainder of his life. Since the office of emperor had never been technically hereditary, Andreas' claim would have been without merit under Byzantine law. However, the Empire had vanished, and Western states generally followed the Roman-church-sanctioned principles of hereditary sovereignty. Seeking a life in the west, Andreas styled himself Imperator Constantinopolitanus ("Emperor of Constantinople"), and sold his succession rights to both Charles VIII of France and the Catholic Monarchs.|$|E
