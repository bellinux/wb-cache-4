50|$|There are {{a couple}} of {{propulsion}} techniques for AUVs. Some of them use a brushed or brush-less electric motor, gearbox, Lip seal, and a propeller which may be surrounded by a nozzle or not. All of these parts embedded in the AUV construction are involved in propulsion. Other vehicles use a thruster unit to maintain the modularity. Depending on the need, the thruster may be equipped with a nozzle for propeller collision protection or to reduce noise submission, or it may be equipped with a direct drive thruster to keep the efficiency at the highest level and the noises at the lowest level. Advanced AUV thrusters have a redundant <b>shaft</b> <b>sealing</b> system to guarantee a proper seal of the robot even if one of the seals fails during the mission.|$|E

40|$|The use of rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> made of PTFE {{material}} is ever increasing in the sealing of moving machine elements {{as a consequence}} of their high thermal and chemical resistance. Primarily in the sector of pressure-loadable rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seals,</b> there is a high development demand. High circumferential velocity and high pressure of the liquid to be sealed make the use of elastomer seals impossible. A promising alternative is presented by PTFE rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seals.</b> The relieved rotary <b>shaft</b> lip <b>seal</b> represents a special design among PTFE rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seals.</b> Not relying on thermal resistance of the PTFE material alone, the relieved rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> as far as possible reduces the heat generating frictional moment for the permissible pressure range of the liquid to be sealed. Besides a high relative velocity at the sealing edge, thus, at the same time, high pressure of the liquid to be sealed is possible. Within the scope of this report, a contribution was made to the optimization of the relieved rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seal.</b> Earlier designs of the relieved rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seal,</b> similar to other commercially available rotary <b>shaft</b> <b>seals,</b> sometimes exhibited temporary surge-like leakages, the cause of which is the thermal expansion of the PTFE material. This was remedied by a functional analysis of the sealing system, experimental investigations, and by the use of FE simulations. In this way, the plastic memory effect, the temperature-dependent re-deformation capability of pre-deformed workpieces, proved to be a helpful measure against thermal expansion. (orig.

40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage is an {{innovator}} approach to fight climate changes through {{the reduction of}} greenhouse gas emissions. Abandoned coal mines are currently less studied than other reservoirs but {{could also be used}} for the storage of carbon dioxide. However the problem of <b>shaft</b> <b>sealing</b> appears to be central as far as the safety, economic, ecologic and health stakes of geological storage are concerned. The purpose of the present work is the study of <b>shaft</b> <b>sealing</b> in the framework of CO 2 storage projects. More precisely the problem consists in the numerical study, with the LAGAMINE finite elements code, of gas transfers around a shaft seal system. A coupled hydro-mechanical model of unsaturated geomaterials is presented. The response of the flow model is first studied through a simple synthetic problem simulating the injection of gas in a concrete-made column. It stands out of this first modeling that the advection of the gas phase represents the main transfer mechanism of CO 2 in highly unsaturated materials. Furthermore the setting of a bentonite barrier seal allows limiting considerably gas influx to the biosphere. A 2 D axisymetric hydromechanical modeling of the Anderlues natural gas storage site is then performed. The design of the shaft seal system appears to be a determinant element to evaluate the risks of CO 2 leakage...|$|E

40|$|The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) is {{a planned}} {{geologic}} repository for permanent disposal of transuranic waste generated by US government defense programs. Located near Carlsbad in southeastern New Mexico, the facility`s disposal regions are mined from the bedded salt of the Salado Formation {{at a depth}} of approximately 652 m. Four shafts service the operational needs of the facility for air intake, exhaust, waste handling and salt handling. These shafts range in diameter from 3. 5 to 6. 1 m and extend from the ground surface to the repository. During repository closure, following an operational life of approximately 50 years, these shafts will be sealed in accordance with an acceptable design. Under contract to the US Department of Energy (DOE), the Repository Isolation Systems Department (RISD) of Sandia National Laboratories has developed a design for the WIPP <b>shaft</b> <b>sealing</b> system. This design has been reviewed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of the 1996 WIPP Compliance Certification Application (CCA).

While most mechanical seals are designed to operate on a liquid film, there are options for designing seal faces which function reliably while operating on a hydrodynamic gas film. In a dual pressurized seal (Arrangement 3), gas seals can provide unique benefits in terms of energy costs, reliability, and emissions control. Dual gas seals however require special considerations when reviewing potential applications. These include the nature of the process fluid, the design of the pump, and the operation of the equipment. In addition, the success of the installation will depend on the design and reliability of the gas supply system.

With careful selection and operation of the seal and sealing system, dual pressurized gas seals can be an important option for many pump applications...|$|E
40|$|The fleet is {{plagued with}} leaking lube oil pumps due to {{mechanical}} shaft seal failures. Correction programs {{have resulted in}} improved <b>shaft</b> <b>sealing</b> techniques however, there {{continues to be a}} leakage problem on most classes of ships. The ultimate solution is to eliminate the mechanical shaft seal. This has been proven to be a very successful solution and has additional benefits of eliminating the motor to pump coupling, which further reduces maintenance. The newly developed Canned Lube Oil Pump is the solution. It combines the proven screw pump design with the proven Oil-Through motor design. The resulting compact pumping unit is substantially smaller and lighter than the legacy unit. The motor is cooled by a portion of the oil, that is being pumped to the system. This eliminates the motor cooling fan and eliminates grease packed motor bearings, further reducing maintenance. A comprehensive factory and shipboard testing program has demonstrated that this new unit will eliminate oil leaking from lube oil pumps, thus will reduce shipboard maintenance substantially...|$|E
40|$|Evidence of {{propellant}} leakage across ball-valve <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> {{has been}} noted during the disassembly of five flight engines and one test engine at the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, White Sands Test Facility. Based on data collected during the disassembly of these five engines, the consequences of propellant leakage across the ball-valve <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> {{can be divided into}} four primary areas of concern: Damage to the ball-valve pinion shafts, damage to sleeved bearings inside the ball-valve and actuator assemblies, degradation of the synthetic rubber o-rings used in the actuator assemblies, and corrosion and degradation to the interior of the actuator assemblies. The exact time at which leakage across the ball-valve <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> occurs has not been determined, however, the leakage most likely occurs during engine firings when, depending on the specification used, ball-valve cavity pressures range as high as 453 to 550 psia. This potential pressure range for the ball-valve cavities greatly exceeds the acceptance leakage test pressure of 332 psia. Since redesign and replacement of the ball-valve <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> is unlikely, the near term solution to prevent damage that occurs from shaft-seal leakage is to implement a routine overhaul and maintenance program for engines in the fleet.
