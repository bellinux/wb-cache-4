5000|$|For {{the kingdom}} of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the third hour, and saw others {{standing}} idle in the marketplace, And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way. Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise. And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive. So when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his <b>steward,</b> <b>Call</b> the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny. And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house, Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day. But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good? So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen...

50|$|Unfortunately, due to Womack's {{legal and}} {{financial}} problems, {{the publication of}} $tud was delayed {{for more than three}} years.

50|$|From {{this place}} {{originated}} {{the line of}} later Stewards of Gondor. It was home to a family of Númenórean nobles, and from them came Húrin, chosen by King Minardil of Gondor as his Steward. Later kings of Gondor chose their stewards only from among Húrin's descendants, and eventually the Stewardship of Gondor became hereditary (the <b>stewards</b> <b>called</b> themselves members of the House of Húrin).|$|R

60|$|Henry was {{the fourteenth}} {{of us to}} go {{overside}} into the dark and salty disintegration of the sea.

He touched my arm half beyond his servant's self, as he gloated for'ard at the men heaving two corpses overside. Weighted with coal, they sank immediately, so that we could not identify them.|$|R
50|$|Reportedly, Senna {{retired to}} his motor home where he {{broke down in}} tears and {{collapsed}} onto the floor. This had concerned Williams, who asked Betise Assumpção to arrange a meeting to discuss Senna's emotional state. Senna decided not to attend the post-qualifying press conference, leading the FIA to discuss but decide not to take disciplinary action against him. On the following day, however, Race <b>Stewards</b> <b>called</b> Senna out of his motor home to discuss his having commandeered a course car to visit Ratzenberger's crash site. A row ensued and Senna stormed off in disgust. The Stewards decided to take no action.|$|R

25|$|Liverpool's {{adoption}} of a deficit budget for 1985/86 meant that the council quickly ran short of money. By September {{it was apparent that}} without a new source of funds, the council would be insolvent in December; as an employer it was therefore obliged to issue 90-day redundancy notices to its entire workforce. After this decision was announced on 6 September, the council's joint shop <b>stewards</b> <b>called</b> for an indefinite strike, and also occupied council buildings and prevented the council from holding a meeting to formally vote to issue the redundancy notices. The national leaderships of the trade unions attempted to restrain their local branches from going ahead with the strike, and when NALGO members voted against the strike by 7,284 to 8,152, it was called off.|$|R
60|$|But, alas! {{all this}} perfume {{could not be}} wasted for nothing; and the masters-at-arms and ship's corporals, putting this and that together, very soon burrowed into the secret.

5000|$|On one side, this {{restraint}} {{demonstrates that}} the sailors were not Spartacists, on the other that the revolution had no guidance. Even if Liebknecht had been a revolutionary leader like Lenin, to which legend later made him, the sailors {{as well as the}} councils would not have accepted him as such. Thus the only result of the Christmas Crisis, which the Spartacists named [...] "Ebert's Bloody Christmas", was that the Revolutionary <b>Stewards</b> <b>called</b> for a demonstration on Christmas Day and the USPD left the government in protest on 29 December. They could not have done Ebert a bigger favor, since he had let them participate only under the pressure of revolutionary events. Within a few days, the military defeat of the Ebert government had turned into a political victory.|$|R

5000|$|On 8 November, {{driven by}} events to {{accelerate}} their plan, the <b>Stewards</b> <b>called</b> {{for a general}} strike in Berlin on the next day. The Spartacists, the SPD and the unions supported the call. On 9 November, workers' and soldiers' councils were formed, the headquarters of police was occupied {{and hundreds of thousands}} of demonstrators converged on the city centre. Imperial Chancellor Max of Baden announced that Emperor Wilhelm II had abdicated and handed over his office to Friedrich Ebert. In the afternoon Ebert grudgingly asked the USPD to nominate three ministers for the future government. Yet that evening a group of several hundred followers of the Stewards occupied the Reichstag and held an impromptu debate. They called for the election of soldiers' and workers' councils the next day (one per battalion or 1,000 workers). They were to assemble at [...] "Zirkus Busch" [...] and elect a provisional revolutionary government—the Rat der Volksbeauftragten.|$|R

50|$|Race 12 {{took place}} on Saturday afternoon, with {{regulations}} requiring each car to make at least one pit stop to change all four tyres. Caruso made a better start than Van Gisbergen and took the lead going into the first corner. At Turn 5, Tim Slade touched the rear of Rick Kelly's car, causing Kelly to hit and spin Lowndes. Slade was not penalised, with the <b>stewards</b> <b>calling</b> the contact a racing incident. Tander was also involved in contact on the first lap, losing his driver's door, while Nick Percat retired from the race with suspension damage. The safety car was deployed to allow marshals to collect Tander's door. The race was restarted {{at the end of}} lap 3 and Van Gisbergen made contact with Caruso at the final corner, allowing him to take the lead on the run to the line. However, as Van Gisbergen passed Caruso before the control line, he was given a drive-through penalty. After the race Van Gisbergen admitted that the move was his mistake. The restart also saw Whincup and Pye make contact, with the latter scraping the wall on the pit straight.|$|R
5000|$|Oh So Sharp ended her racing {{career in}} the St Leger on the 14 September when she was opposed by five colts in the 209th running of the St Leger over {{fourteen}} and a half furlongs. As she had already won the 1000 Guineas and the Oaks she was attempting to complete the fillies' version of the Triple Crown a feat which had last been achieved by Meld in 1955. She started the 8/11 favourite with her closest rival in the betting being her stable companion Lanfranco, winner of the William Hill Futurity and the King Edward VII Stakes. Oh So Sharp moved past Lanfranco in the straight {{but was unable to}} draw away from the colt and quickly came under renewed pressure from her stable companion and from the outsider Phardante. Oh So Sharp hung to the right in the closing stages before winning by three-quarters of a length and a head from Phardante and Lanfranco. The racecourse <b>stewards</b> <b>called</b> an inquiry into possible interference caused by the winner but the result was allowed to stand. Cecil admitted that the filly's form had been declining and said that [...] "another week and it might have been too late".|$|R
5000|$|However, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, {{in front}} of a pro-Pavlik crowd (approximately 6,231 Youngstown natives made the trip), Pavlik {{defeated}} Jermain Taylor on September 29, 2007. In the pre-fight build-up, Taylor's trainer, Emmanuel <b>Steward,</b> <b>called</b> Pavlik [...] "overrated" [...] and promised a knockout win for his boxer. It nearly happened, as Pavlik was knocked down in the second round and tossed about the ring for much of that round. However, using his reach advantage and ability to trap opponents in the corner, Pavlik slowly turned the tide on Taylor. By the sixth round, many at the ringside, such as the HBO commentator Larry Merchant, saw the fight as even. HBO's unofficial scorer, Harold Lederman, even had Pavlik leading the fight at the halfway point. Despite this, he was trailing on all three official scorecards. In the seventh round, Pavlik stunned his opponent with a clean left hook to the chin and backed him against the ropes knocking Taylor out with a barrage of punches. With the victory, Pavlik became the new WBC, WBO, The Ring and lineal middleweight champion. After the fight with Taylor, Pavlik and his father, Mike Pavlik Sr., accidentally left their paychecks in their hotel room. He was named The Boxing Times Fighter of the Year in 2007.|$|R
