5|$|American goldfinches are {{occasionally}} {{victims of}} brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. One {{study found that}} 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. American goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with <b>studies</b> <b>showing</b> low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is {{despite the fact that}} the American goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough nutrition; the seed-rich diet of American goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.|$|E
5|$|Peter Milner, in {{a review}} in the Canadian Journal of Psychology, noted the book was short on {{concrete}} details on implementing the TOTE strategy. He also critically viewed the book as {{not being able to}} tie its model to details from neurophysiology at a molecular level. Per him, the book covered only the brain at the gross level of lesion <b>studies,</b> <b>showing</b> that some of its regions could possibly implement some TOTE strategies, without giving a reader an indication as to how the region could implement the strategy.|$|E

The same <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> that UND research generated a total of 1,649 jobs, of which 728 were on campus.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review was to summarise evidence {{on the effects of}} job rotation on musculoskeletal complaints, exposures related to musculoskeletal complaints and sustainable working life parameters. A total of 16 studies were included. No studies on sustainable working life parameters were found. The quality of the studies was assessed using a checklist; eight field studies and three laboratory studies of sufficient quality were used to summarise the following evidence: one field <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> positive results and one field <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> negative results for musculoskeletal complaints, two field <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> positive results and two field <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> inconsistent results for exposures, and two field <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> inconsistent results for musculoskeletal complaints and exposures. Two laboratory <b>studies</b> <b>showed</b> inconsistent results and one laboratory <b>study</b> <b>showed</b> no changes for exposures. In conclusion, there is currently inconsistent evidence for positive or negative effects of job rotation on musculoskeletal complaints and exposures related to musculoskeletal complaints. Practitioner's Summary: Currently, there is inconsistent evidence for recommending job rotation as a strategy for preventing musculoskeletal complaints. Exposures from all involved work activities and body regions should be identified and assessed first, to determine if job rotation provides increased exposure variation and/or beneficial changes in mean exposures related to musculoskeletal complaint...|$|R

Electronics who manufacture {{printed circuit boards}} and electronic products, El-Ran Timber Industries, Jordael who manufacture cosmetic products, and a Unilever Shefa Israel cereal plant. Since 1971, Arad has been producing phosphoric acid, made from brine collected from the Dead Sea, and phosphates from the nearby Tzefa. Rotem Amfert Negev Ltd, a subsidiary of Israel Chemicals Ltd (ICL), has been planning a new phosphate plant in the Sdeh Brir area for several years. In 2008, the Ministry of the Environment decided not to contest the company's bid, despite <b>studies</b> <b>showing</b> it may increase air pollution-related deaths in the area.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of these}} {{positive}} outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other <b>studies</b> <b>showing</b> a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E
5|$|Uniparental {{inheritance}} {{leads to}} little opportunity for genetic recombination between different lineages of mitochondria, although a single mitochondrion can contain 2â€“10 copies of its DNA. For this reason, mitochondrial DNA is usually thought to reproduce by binary fission. What recombination does take place maintains genetic integrity rather than maintaining diversity. However, there are <b>studies</b> <b>showing</b> evidence of recombination in mitochondrial DNA. It {{is clear that}} the enzymes necessary for recombination are present in mammalian cells. Further, evidence suggests that animal mitochondria can undergo recombination. The data are a bit more controversial in humans, although indirect evidence of recombination exists. If recombination does not occur, the whole mitochondrial DNA sequence represents a single haplotype, which makes it useful for studying the evolutionary history of populations.|$|E
