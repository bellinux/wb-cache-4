40|$|The paper {{provides}} an overall {{assessment of the}} environmental effects of co-incineration of <b>cutting</b> oil <b>emulsions</b> in cement plants through the quantification of emissions of key pollutants, namely NOx, CO and VOC. Two realistic scenarios are considered. In the first, the <b>cutting</b> oil <b>emulsion</b> is injected directly into the rotary kiln while the second scenario involves injection of the <b>cutting</b> oil <b>emulsion</b> in the tertiary air stream and thus directly into the precalciner. A detailed kinetic PSR modelling study is performed for combustion conditions relevant both to cement kiln and precalciner operating conditions. It is demonstrated that, although NOx emissions from the precalciner are generally substantially lower than those from the cement kiln, emulsion injection in the latter appears to be favourable and can lead up to 50 % reductions in NO levels. However, injection of <b>cutting</b> oil <b>emulsion</b> with relatively high nitrogen content in the precalciner may lead, under lean conditions, to increases in the emitted NO levels. The effect of <b>cutting</b> oil <b>emulsion</b> on CO and VOC emissions both under cement kiln and precalciner conditions is also quantified. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of cutting}} fluid in milling {{operations}} causes {{increase of temperature}} variation on the tool and may cause decrease of tool life. However, sometimes its use is necessary due to possible deleterious influence the temperature increase may have on the workpiece.

Esses FC s foram contaminados de forma induzida através de inoculações periódicas até alcançarem o nível de contaminação média igual a 105 UFC/mL. Deste modo, foi possível comparar a eficiência dos FC s novos com os contaminados no processo de torneamento. Os resultados mostraram que as contaminações dos FC s com 105 UFC/mL, alteraram o pH do meio, desestabilizaram as emulsões e causaram pequenas mudanças nos parâmetros de forças de usinagem, rugosidade e vida da ferramenta, principalmente nas condições com baixa velocidade de corte e taxas de avanço. Assim, para baixas velocidades de corte, os fluidos de corte contaminados, principalmente de base vegetal, podem causar pequenas influências em importantes parâmetros de usinabilidade do processo.

The results showed that the contaminated cutting fluids with 105 UFC/mL changed the pH, destabilized the emulsions and caused small changes in the machinability parameters (maching force, surface roughness and tool life), mainly under low cutting speeds and feed rates.

No sample pre-treatment was required and measurement was via a non-invasive, flexible, dip in probe. DWS relies on the concept of the diffusive migration of light, as opposed to the ballistic scatter model used in conventional dynamic light scattering. The specific requirements of the optoelectronic hardware, data analysis methods and light scattering model were studied experimentally and, where practical, theoretically resulting in a novel technique of analysis of particle suspensions and emulsions of volume fractions between 0. 01 and 0. 4. Operation at high concentrations made the technique oblivious to dust and contamination. A pure homodyne (autodyne) experimental arrangement described was resilient to environmental disturbances, unlike many other systems which utilise optical fibres or heterodyne operation. Pilot and subsequent prototype development led to a highly accurate method of size ranking, suitable for analysis {{of a wide range of}} suspensions and emulsions. The technique was shown to operate on real industrial samples with statistical variance as low as 0. 3 % with minimal software processing. Whilst the application studied was the analysis of TiO_ 2 suspensions, a diverse range of materials including polystyrene beads, cell pastes and industrial <b>cutting</b> fluid <b>emulsions</b> were tested. Results suggest that, whilst all sizing should be comparative to suitable standards, concentration effects may be minimised and even completely modelled-out in many applications. Adhesion to the optical probe was initially a significant problem but was minimised after the evaluation and use of suitable non stick coating materials. Unexpected behaviour in the correlation in the region of short decay times led to consideration of the effects of rotational diffusion coefficient. The inherent instability of high density suspensions instigated high speed analysis techniques capable of monitoring suspensions that were undergoing rapid change as well as suggesting novel methods for the evaluation of the state of sample dispersion.

40|$|The term biosolids {{refers to}} the nutrient-rich organic {{materials}} resulting from the treatment of domestic sewage at a wastewater treatment facility. It is a widely acceptable term for sewage sludge that has been treated at a wastewater treatment plant and is beneficially recycled. Biosolids inherently come from sewage sludge, so {{they have the same}} origin and biological nature, but a different applicability. The quantity of municipal biosolids produced increases annually in the United States. The production of biosolids has increased because of both the advance of sanitation and wastewater treatment and the growth of population. Sludge or biosolids are contaminated by varying amounts of heavy metals or hazardous organic compounds from industrial and commercial wastewater. Therefore, society has to face the potential for increased negative impacts on the environment from the increasing volume of biosolids being produced. Public concerns about applied biosolids treatment or reuse methods are potential health, environmental, or aesthetic impacts (such things as disease, odors), because of the pollutants in the biosolids. The most commonly used methods for biosolids treatment and recycling are briefly reviewed in the first two chapters of this thesis. However, the current biosolids treatment or recycling options have their own defects. A new and innovative technology, deep biosolids injection, is proposed for the treatment of biosolids and is to be implemented by Los Angeles where the City has been granted underground solids injection control permits under Class V wells by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Deep biosolids injection is a process referred to as one type of several deep underground injection techniques. It shares many similarities with slurried solids injection above the fracture pressure, which has been successfully used for the treatment of slurried non-hazardous solid materials produced in the oil industry such as drill <b>cuttings,</b> viscous <b>emulsions</b> with clay, oily sand, NORMs (naturally occurring radioactive materials), pipe scale, tank bottoms, soil from spill clean-up, and so on. The distinctive biosolids properties result in injection mechanisms different from other slurry injection processes. Filtration and consolidation processes occur simultaneously along with injection of biosolids, and these must be understood in order to properly design and manage a biosolids injection operation. Hydraulic fracture mechanisms, filtration theory and consolidation principles provide the basis for the interpretation of biosolids injection process. A semi-analytical hydraulic fracture model for injection of a compressible substance (biosolids) is developed as a modification of the Perkins-Kern-Nordgren (PKN) hydraulic fracture model. The PKN model is modified with a pseudo-dynamic leak-off function that describes the deposition of biosolids (filtration) and plugging effect of biosolids on the fracture wall in a porous medium. The pseudo-dynamic leak-off function is given in terms of the net pressure and the resistance of the filter cake to flow. The hydraulic fracture model is employed to compute the volume of biosolids slurry remaining in an open induced fracture. The consolidation process in the closure phase of deep biosolids injection is described using the biosolids properties under different stress conditions. A Terzaghi-type relationship is used to compute the volume change in the closure phase using compressibility data available from published literature. In contrast to the conventional PKN leak-off model, simulation results using the new model show that the induced fracture volume is much larger because of the impaired leak-off and because of the volumetric effects and consolidation of the biosolids in the fracture. Solids contents and biosolids compaction behavior have significant impacts on the geometry of fracture (width, length, volume) over time. The model was developed to help guide large-scale injection of municipal and animal biosolids as an environmentally more secure method of treatment than surface approaches...|$|R
