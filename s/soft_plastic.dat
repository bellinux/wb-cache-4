50|$|Vinyl dye is {{a product}} often marketed for use in recoloring vinyl {{upholstery}} in vehicles. It is also useful in recoloring <b>soft</b> <b>plastics.</b> Unlike conventional paint, vinyl dye seeps into the surface it is applied to, resulting in a color that will not peel or chip.|$|R
25|$|Japanese {{mayonnaise}} {{is typically}} made with {{apple cider vinegar}} or rice vinegar and {{a small amount of}} MSG, which gives it a different flavor from mayonnaise made from distilled vinegar. It is most often sold in <b>soft</b> <b>plastic</b> squeeze bottles. Its texture is thicker than most Western commercial mayonnaise in part because only egg yolks and not the entire egg is used when making it.|$|E
25|$|Around the 1960s to 1970s Woman's Weekly {{magazine}} {{gave away}} a <b>soft</b> <b>plastic</b> on-needle knitting row counter of unusual but simple design. Two numbered blue-and-white barrels rotate independently around a central white spindle, {{which has a}} number-pointer {{at one end and}} a loop to thread onto a needle at the other end. The friction (to prevent the barrels rolling freely) is maintained by the tightness of the number-pointer and shortness of the spindle.|$|E
25|$|Animatronics is a multi-disciplinary field which {{integrates}} anatomy, robots, mechatronics, and puppetry {{resulting in}} lifelike animation. Animatronic figures are often powered by pneumatics, hydraulics, and/or by electrical means, {{and can be}} implemented using both computer control and human control, including teleoperation. Motion actuators are often used to imitate muscle movements and create realistic motions in limbs. Figures are covered with body shells and flexible skins made of hard and <b>soft</b> <b>plastic</b> materials and finished with details like colors, hair and feathers and other components to make the figure more life like.|$|E
50|$|Mattel's Barbie doll, which {{appeared}} in March 1959, was based on Bild Lilli dolls that co-founder Ruth Handler had acquired in Hamburg. Barbie was made of <b>softer</b> <b>plastic,</b> wore less makeup, had paler skin, and the doll had rooted hair and non-moulded shoes and earrings—apart from {{that she was a}} lookalike of Lilli.|$|R
5000|$|In 1974, {{named after}} the {{increasingly}} popular martial art, Hasbro introduced [...] "Kung-Fu Grip" [...] to the G.I. Joe line. This was another innovation that had been developed in the UK for Action Man. The hands were molded in a <b>softer</b> <b>plastic</b> that allowed the fingers to grip objects in a more lifelike fashion.|$|R
50|$|Beach Head {{was first}} {{released}} {{as part of}} the fifth series in 1986 as the Joe team's Ranger, and came with a gray submachine gun, a large black backpack, and a black bag of ammunition. There are two versions of his ammo case, the earlier version is made of hard plastic which was prone to breakage, and later replaced with one of <b>softer</b> <b>plastic.</b>|$|R
25|$|Creme {{eggs are}} usually sold {{individually}} {{but are also}} available in boxes containing a varying quantity of eggs depending on the country the packaging is intended for. The foil wrapping of the eggs was traditionally green, red, yellow and blue in colour in the United Kingdom and Ireland, though green was removed and purple replaced blue early in the 21st century. In the United States, some green is incorporated into the design, which previously featured the product's mascot—the Creme Egg Chick. As of 2015, the packaging in Canada {{has turned into a}} 34g, purple, red and yellow <b>soft</b> <b>plastic</b> shell.|$|E
25|$|Blue runner is also of high {{importance}} to recreational fisheries, with anglers often taking the species both {{for food and}} to use as bait. The blue runner {{has a reputation as}} an excellent gamefish on light tackle, taking both fish baits, as well a variety of lures including hard-bodied bibbed lures, spoons, metal jigs and <b>soft</b> <b>plastic</b> jigs. The species is also a target for light tackle saltwater fly fishermen, and can push 6-weight fly tackle to its limits. The blue runner is used extensively as live bait for larger fish, including billfish, cobia and amberjack. It is considered a fairly low-quality table fish, and larger specimens are known to carry the ciguatera toxin in their flesh, with several cases reported from the Virgin Islands.|$|E
25|$|Bandai {{released}} {{a number of}} action figures related to the film; these toys including {{a number of different}} Baymax figures. One is a <b>soft</b> <b>plastic</b> 10-inch version that includes a series of projected stills from the film on his stomach, which can be changed when the figure's arm is moved, and which emits accompanying sounds. Deluxe Flying Baymax, which retails for $39.99, depicts the armored version of the character and features lights and sounds that activate at the push of a button. Placing the Hiro figurine on his back changes the sounds into speech and when the figure is tilted, the sounds are those of flying. The Armor-Up Baymax (original retail cost $19.99) comes with 20 pieces of armor that can be assembled onto the robot by the owner. The other characters from the film, including the other members of team and Professor Callaghan (who is called Yokai) are issued in 4-inch action figures, each of which have eight points of articulation.|$|E
50|$|Still, Stahlbergs were {{produced}} in a softer, somewhat more flexible, polyurethane plastic than the harder polystyrene of traditional American promotional models (Klockau 2012). Thus, Stahlbergs {{are prone to}} fewer cracks and breaks, yet are easier to scratch - similar to other toy vehicles molded in <b>softer</b> <b>plastics.</b> Models are molded in various colors and unpainted. Streaks of darker or lighter color are commonly found through the plastic.|$|R
2500|$|All black {{bass are}} scent {{as well as}} visual predators so care {{should be taken to}} ensure no foreign scents, like bug spray, or any outdoor chemicals, or any {{personal}} chemicals, like tobacco, contaminate one's hands when handling your line, reels, rods, artificial baits, and particularly <b>soft</b> <b>plastics.</b> [...] Bass are usually filleted when taken for the table; the flesh is white and flaky, with a mild taste when cooked.|$|R
40|$|EP 2172578 A 1 UPAB: 20100420 NOVELTY - A process {{removes a}} hard coat of varying {{thickness}} from a softer substrate e. g. a hard coat of aluminium from an underlying <b>softer</b> <b>plastic</b> web of e. g. PET foil. The substrate (11) and coating enter (16) and advance through a vacuum chamber (12). A sputter magnetron (14 a) within the vacuum chamber generates plasma (15) that activates the hard surface resulting in {{removal of material}} from the soft substrate. The inlet (16) is located either {{before or after the}} sputter magnetron as seen in the direction of substrate advance. Also claimed is a commensurate assembly. USE - Process and assembly to remove high zones from the surface of a hard e. g. plastic substrate on an underlying <b>softer</b> <b>plastic</b> substrate. ADVANTAGE - The process and assembly are simpler than prior art. Further claimed are that the process and assembly are suitable for use in a roll-to-roll coating assembly and that the process minimises thermal stress on the substrate...|$|R
25|$|The yellowspotted {{trevally}} is {{of moderate}} importance to fisheries throughout its range, so catch statistics are rarely kept for this species specifically. One exception is Saudi Arabia, with the FAO reporting a yearly catch between 128 and 324 tonnes between 2000 and 2004, {{with no apparent}} trends in the catch data. The species is taken by hook and line, gill nets, and various traps. The yellowspotted trevally is of major importance to anglers and spearfishermen in some countries, with the species highly valued in Australia and South Africa. Surveys of recreational catches in the Pilbara region of Western Australia indicate around 5 tonnes of fish are taken every year, with around 3 tonnes kept for consumption or use as bait. Fish are mostly caught from boats using small baits including fish and crab, as well as lures, minnows, metal slugs, <b>soft</b> <b>plastic</b> lures, and even saltwater flies. It is an excellent gamefish, with young fish also considered good table fish, becoming somewhat dry with age. The yellowspotted trevally is also considered {{a good candidate for}} aquaculture in the future.|$|E
25|$|In Australia and Japan, {{members of}} the family are highly sought after by anglers for their {{sporting}} and eating qualities, with anglers often taking more than commercial fishermen in some areas. The fishing techniques for all sillaginids are quite similar, with the shallow habitats often requiring light line and quiet movements. Whiting are also popular in part due to their accessibility, with tidal flats around beaches, estuaries and jetties common habitats from where many whiting species are caught without need for a boat. Tidal movements also affect catches, as do lunar phases, causing whiting to 'bite' when the tide is changing. Tackle used is kept light to avoid spooking the fish, and often requires only a simple setup, with a hook and light sinker tied directly to the mainline usually effective. In deeper water fished from boats or where currents are strong, more complex rigs are used, often with hooks tied to dropper loops on the trace. in Australia, some specialist whiting fishermen who target the fish in the surf or on shallow banks use red beads or tubing to attract the fish, claiming the method produces more fish. The bait used is normally anything from the surrounding environment which the whiting naturally prey on, with polychaetes, bivalves, crustaceans such as prawns and crabs, cephalopods and small fish effective for most species. As with most species, live bait is known to produce better catches. Lure fishing for whiting is not normally practiced, but saltwater flies have been used to good effect, as have small <b>soft</b> <b>plastic</b> lures. In some areas, restrictions to the amount and size of fish are in place and enforced by fishery authorities.|$|E

500|$|... "My sculptural {{techniques}} for the characters' aging were handled by adding pieces of white modeling clay, which matched the plaster, {{onto the surface}} of each bust," [...] Seiderman told visual arts historian Norman Gambill. When Seiderman achieved the desired effect he cast the clay pieces in a <b>soft</b> <b>plastic</b> material that he formulated himself. These appliances were then placed onto the plaster bust and a four-piece mold was made for each phase of aging. The castings were then fully painted and paired with the appropriate wig for evaluation.|$|E
500|$|The {{substance}} that the suspect tried to detonate {{was more than}} [...] of pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), a crystalline powder that is often the active ingredient of plastic explosives, the high explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP), and other ingredients. PETN {{is among the most}} powerful of explosives, and chemically resembles nitroglycerin. The powder was analyzed by the FBI at Quantico, and an FBI affidavit filed in the Eastern District of Michigan reflected preliminary findings that the device contained PETN. The authorities also found the remains of the syringe. The suspect apparently carried the PETN onto the plane in a -long <b>soft</b> <b>plastic</b> container, possibly a condom, attached to his underwear. Much of the container was lost in the fire. ABC News cited a government test indicating that [...] of PETN can blow a hole in the side of an airliner, and posted photos of the remains of Abdulmutallab's underwear and explosive packet.|$|E
500|$|With the {{exception}} of 1965 through 1967, proofs have been struck {{each year in the}} same metallic composition as regular issue pieces. [...] The first Kennedy half dollar proofs were struck in early January 1964. Early strikes depicted Kennedy with heavily accented hair; an estimated 100,000 coins were struck with this feature. This was altered {{for the remainder of the}} mintage of nearly four million proof coins. Due to the coin shortage, the Treasury Department announced that no proof sets would be struck in 1965. Instead, Special Mint Sets would be struck to satisfy collector demand. Coins for these sets, minted at the San Francisco Assay Office, were struck with no mint marks early in 1966 with heavily polished dies dated 1965. Similar sets bearing the dates 1966 and 1967 were also struck. A few of the 1966 halves from the Special Mint Sets are known with Gasparro's initials [...] "FG" [...] missing from the reverse, apparently because of an overpolished die. [...] The first year's production was sold in <b>soft</b> <b>plastic</b> packaging; the 1966 and 1967 issues were sonically sealed in hard plastic cases. In 1968, regular proof coinage was resumed, although production of proof coins was shifted to San Francisco, the [...] "S" [...] mintmark added and sets were encapsulated in hard plastic.|$|E
