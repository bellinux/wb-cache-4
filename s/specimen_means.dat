40|$|AbstractObjective The primary {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to establish the degree to which chondrocyte apoptosis occurs in vivo following intraarticular fractures in humans. Design Fracture cartilage specimens were obtained from patients undergoing surgical intervention for fractures of the articular surface of the proximal tibia. Normal proximal tibia cartilage specimens served as controls. Apoptotic chondrocytes were identified and quantified using TUNEL analysis. Results The percentage of TUNEL positive chondrocytes in the fractured articular cartilage <b>specimens</b> (<b>mean</b> 18. 5 %, range 1 – 44 %) was found to be an order of magnitude higher than the percentage observed in control <b>specimens</b> (<b>mean</b> 1. 9 %, range 0 – 4 %). Conclusions The percentage of TUNEL positive chondrocytes following intraarticular fracture is much higher than that reported for chronic degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. These data provide strong evidence that chondrocyte apoptosis is a consequence of intraarticular fracture and suggest that chondrocyte apoptosis may play a particularly significant role in the subsequent development of post-traumatic arthritis.

To {{get a more}} complete understanding of the disease burden caused by Shigella in Nha Trang, Vietnam, real-time PCR was used to detect Shigella DNA. Randomly selected rectal swab specimens from 60 Shigella culture-positive patients and 500 Shigella culture-negative patients detected by population-based surveillance of patients seeking care for diarrhea were processed by real-time PCR. The target of the primer pair is the invasion plasmid antigen H gene sequence (ipaH), carried by all four Shigella species and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli. Shigella spp. could be isolated from the rectal swabs of 547 of 19, 206 (3 %) patients with diarrhea. IpaH was detected in 55 of 60 (93 %) Shigella culture-positive specimens, whereas it was detected in 87 of 245 (36 %) culture-negative patients free of dysentery (P < 0. 001).

Ligase chain reaction (LCR) is both highly sensitive and specific {{for the detection of}} N. gonorrhoeae in urine and patient-obtained vaginal swab specimens. Because of the LCR test's exquisite sensitivity, it may potentially detect DNA from nonviable organisms following effective therapy, leading to false-positive test results and unnecessary additional treatment. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the duration that gonococcal DNA is detectable by LCR following therapy for uncomplicated gonococcal infection. One hundred thirty men and women between the ages of 16 and 50 years presenting to a sexually transmitted disease clinic with urogenital gonorrhea were enrolled. After the standard history was taken and a genital examination was done, the patients were asked to submit either a urine specimen (men) or a urine specimen plus a self-obtained vaginal swab specimen (women) for N. gonorrhoeae testing by LCR at the initial visit and each day during the study period. At enrollment, patients were treated with single doses of ofloxacin, cefixime, or ceftriaxone. The median time to a negative urine LCR test result was 1 day for the men (mean, 1. 6 ± 0. 14 days) and 2 days for the women (mean, 1. 7 ± 0. 19 days).

40|$|Introduction: One of {{the factors}} that {{contribute}} to the total needle-targeting error in medical procedures is needle deflection, which can lead to e. g. hemorrhage, prolonged intervention time and decreased treatment efficiency. This deflection can be defined as the deviation of the needle from its suspected straight insertion path. In this study, we focused on the effect of tissue heterogeneity on needle deflection. We hypothesized that needle deflection would be bigger for insertions into heterogeneous than homogeneous specimens, due to an unequal force distribution on the needle. Method: the inner needle of a 18 Gauge trocar needle with triangular tip was inserted (5 mm/s) multiple times at several positions into 4 gelatin-, 4 animal liver-, and 2 human liver specimens. Deflection in X- and Y-direction was measured using sliding gauges and axial forces acting on the needle were captured using a force sensor mounted onto the needle hub. Axial force analysis was used to give a rough estimation of the mechanical properties of the specimens. Results: Results show an increase in magnitude and variance for needle insertions into the liver <b>specimens</b> (Animal: <b>Mean</b> = 1. 01 mm, SD = 0. 54, Human: Mean = 0. 83 mm, SD = 0. 48) compared with those into gelatin <b>specimens</b> (<b>Mean</b> = 0. 59 mm, SD = 0. 26 mm). Differences between the median and maximal needle tip forces for insertions into gelatin were almost zero (Mean = 0. 08, SD = 0. 04 N), whereas those differences were bigger for insertions into tissue <b>specimens</b> (<b>Mean</b> = 0. 58, SD = 0. 23 N), indicating the homogeneous nature of gelatin and heterogeneous nature of tissue. Discussion: The results obtained in this study suggest that heterogeneity causes the needle to deflect from its straight path. Both magnitude and variance of needle deflection are bigger for insertions into heterogeneous tissue specimens than into homogeneous gelatin specimens. A suggestion for future research is to study the effect of pathologic tissue on needle deflection, as this type of tissue is known for being more heterogeneous than healthy tissue.

40|$|Background: Collecting a 24 -h {{urine sample}} is {{recommended}} for monitoring the mean population sodium intake, but implementation can be difficult. Objective: The objective {{was to assess the}} validity of published equations by using spot urinary sodium concentrations to predict 24 -h sodium excretion. Design: This was a cross-sectional study, conducted from June to August 2011 in metropolitan Washington, DC, of 407 adults aged 18 – 39 y, 48 % black, who collected each urine void in a separate container for 24 h. Four timed voids (morning, afternoon, evening, and overnight) were selected from each 24 -h collection. Published equations were used to predict 24 -h sodium excretion with spot urine by specimen timing and race-sex subgroups. We examined mean differences with measured 24 -h sodium excretion (bias) and individual differences with the use of Bland-Altman plots. Results: Across equations and <b>specimens,</b> <b>mean</b> bias in predicting 24 -h sodium excretion for all participants ranged from 2267 to 1300 mg (Kawasaki equation). Bias was least with International Cooperative Study on Salt, Other Factors, and Blood Pressure (INTERSALT) equations with morning (2165 mg; 95 % CI: 2295, 36 mg), afternoon (290 mg; 2208, 28 mg), and evening (2120 mg; 2230, 211 mg) specimens. With overnight <b>specimens,</b> <b>mean</b> bias was least when the Tanaka (223 mg; 95 % CI: 2141, 95 mg) or Mage (2145 mg; 2314, 25 mg) equations were used but was statistically significant when using the Tanaka equations among females (216 to 243 mg) and the Mage equations among races other than black (2554 to 2372 mg). Significant over- and underprediction occurred across individual sodium excretion concentrations. Conclusions: Using a single spot urine, INTERSALT equations may provide the least biased information about population mean sodium intakes among young US adults. None of the equations evaluated provided unbiased estimates of individual 24 -h sodium excretion. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials. gov as NCT 01631240...|$|R

Neutrophils are participants in the acute response against pathogens in many tissues, and their influx into the oral cavity may occur at any time. Objective To compare mean neutrophils and the expression of TLR 2 and TLR 4 in saliva and blood of newborns at risk for sepsis to those of healthy newborns. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted from July to December 2011 in the Division of Neonatology, Department of Child Health, Ulin General Hospital, Lambung Mangkurat University Medical School, Banjarmasin.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{explore a}} new method of kidney biopsy with coaxial trocar and bard biopsy gun under low dose {{computed}} tomography (CT) -guidance and evaluate its accuracy, safety, and efficacy. Methods Sixty patients underwent renal biopsy under CT-guidance. They were randomly {{divided into two}} groups: group I, low dose CT-guided (120 kV and 25 or 50 mAs) and group II, standard dose CT-guided (120 kV and 250 mAs). For group I, the coaxial trocar was accurately placed adjacent to the renal capsule of the lower pole, the needle core was removed, and samples were obtained with a bard biopsy gun. For group II, the coaxial trocar was not used. Total number of passes, mean biopsy diameter, <b>mean</b> glomeruli per <b>specimen,</b> <b>mean</b> operation time, mean scanning time, and mean radiation dose were noted. Dose-length product (DLP) was {{used to calculate the}} radiation doses. After 24 hours of the biopsy, ultrasound was repeated to identify any subcapsular hematoma. Results Success rate of biopsy in group I was 100 % while using low dose CT-guidance along with coaxial trocar renal. There was no statistic differences bewteen group I and II in the total number of passes, mean biopsy diameter, <b>mean</b> glomeruli per <b>specimen</b> and <b>mean</b> time of operation and CT scanning. The average DLP of group I was lower as compared to the value of group II (p Conclusions Kidney biopsy using coaxial trocar and bard biopsy gun under low dose CT was an accurate, simple and safe method for diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases. It can be used for repeat and multiple biopsies, particularly suitable for obese and renal atrophy patients in whom the kidneys are difficult to image. </p...|$|R
