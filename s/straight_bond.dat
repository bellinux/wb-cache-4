Although the final screenplay and film {{was made into a}} comedy spoof, Hecht's version was written as a <b>straight</b> <b>Bond</b> adventure, states spy novelist Jeremy Duns, who recently discovered the original lost scripts. According to Duns, Hecht's version included elements hard to imagine in a film adaptation, adding that [...] "these drafts are a master-class in thriller-writing, from the man who arguably perfected the form with Notorious." [...] Hecht wrote that he has [...] "never had more fun writing a movie", and felt the James Bond character was cinema's first [...] "gentleman superman" [...] in a long time, as opposed to Hammett and Chandler's [...] "roughneck supermen".|$|E

40|$|The {{markets for}} {{longevity}} derivatives {{are starting to}} develop. In last years, many companies have closed the defined benefit retirement plans {{that they used to}} offer to their employees. In addition, some governments increased the retirement age by 2 or 5 years to take into account longevity improvements, population ageing and the financing of pension. The insurance industry is also facing some specific challenges related to longevity risk. More and more capital has to be constituted to face this long-term risk, and new regulations in Europe, together with the recent financial crisis only amplify this phenomenon. Hence, it has become more important for insurance companies and pension funds to find a suitable and efficient way to cross-hedge or to transfer part of the longevity risk to reinsurers or to financial markets. In this study, we develop the models of mortality rates and the pricing models of the longevity risk. We make some remarks regarding forecasting mortality rates using Lee-Carter model and own model. Also, we deal with the securitization of longevity risk through the longevity <b>bonds</b> (the <b>straight</b> <b>bonds),</b> the interest are split between the annuity provider and the investors depending on the realized mortality at each future time by a Special Purpose Company (SPC). stochastic mortality model, Lee-Carter model, longevity risk, <b>straight</b> <b>bonds...</b>|$|R

Because accounting year-ends for most investors in Japan are concentrated in either March or December, this seasonality supports the hypotheses of tax-loss selling and window dressing. Moreover, the seasonality becomes more pronounced as the debt rating declines, {{consistent with the findings}} in previous studies investigating the US bond market. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} whether there is any mispricing of publicly issued <b>straight</b> corporate <b>bonds</b> in Japan, and to determine what factors explain variations in the degree of mispricing. While there is an extremely large literature devoted to investigating the extent of mispricing of initial public offerings (IPOs) of equity in both the United States, and Japan, there appear to be very few studies examining the extent of mispricing of IPOs of <b>straight</b> corporate <b>bonds</b> in the United States and Japan. The key study for the United States is Datta et al. (1997) who find that IPOs of speculative grade ("junk") bonds are underpriced, but those rated investment grade are overpriced. Two later studies for the United States report underpricing rather than overpricing (see Helwege and Kleiman (1998) and Cai et al. (2007)). For Japan, Matsui (2000, 2006) finds that IPO and seasoned issues when analyzed together exhibit significant overpricing too. In this paper, using data on initial (IPO) and seasoned issues of publicly issued <b>straight</b> <b>bonds</b> over the ten year period between March 1992 and March 2002, evidence is presented that suggests the existence of significant mispricing, in particular, overpricing, of these bonds. This overpricing has several features: it does not appear decline overtime; on average, it increases as the rating of the bond issued falls, it is smaller for IPO issues; and it is influenced by the degree of competition among lead underwriters.

40|$|Convertible {{bonds are}} an {{important}} segment of the corporate bond market, with world wide outstandings approaching US$ 235 billion. Simple pricing models value a convertible bond as being equivalent to a <b>straight</b> <b>bond</b> with an embedded option that enables the bond holder to convert to a specific amount of common stock. The <b>straight</b> <b>bond</b> is subject to both interest rate and credit risk, whereas the option to convert {{is dependent on the}} underlying stock price, which exposes the convertible bond holder to equity risk. The complexity of these features means that convertible bonds tend to be treated casually in major derivatives and corporate finance textbooks.
