5|$|Because with Calcraft's methods the {{condemned}} took several minutes to die, to hasten death Calcraft would sometimes dramatically pull on legs or climb on <b>shoulders</b> <b>in</b> {{an effort to}} break a victim's neck. It has been speculated that Calcraft used these methods partly to entertain the crowds, sometimes numbering 30,000 spectators or more.|$|E
5|$|As {{soldiers}} {{approached the}} sacristy, {{one of the}} young sons of defender Anthony Wolf stood to pull a blanket over his <b>shoulders.</b> <b>In</b> the dark, Mexican soldiers mistook him for an adult and killed him. Possibly the last Texian to die in battle was Jacob Walker, who attempted to hide behind Susannah Dickinson and was bayoneted in front of the women. Another Texian, Brigido Guerrero, also sought refuge in the sacristy. Guerrero, who had deserted from the Mexican Army in December 1835, was spared after convincing the soldiers he was a Texian prisoner.|$|E
5|$|CR26 has {{continued}} to deteriorate in the years since, with one , limited maintenance segment seeing the most wear. This section, situated midway between NY30 and NY3, has become both littered with potholes and extremely narrow due to {{the erosion of the}} highway's <b>shoulders.</b> <b>In</b> mid-2009, residents of Loon Lake petitioned the county to repair all of CR26 and to continuously maintain the highway, citing the road's regional importance as a through route for commuters traveling to and from the village of Malone.|$|E

5|$|In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne {{considered}} {{the case of}} the Biddenden Maids from a teratological perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been pygopagus (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the <b>shoulders</b> <b>in</b> drawings. The pygopagus Millie and Christine McCoy had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.|$|E
5|$|The {{coloring}} of the addax's coat {{varies with}} the season. In the winter, it is greyish-brown with white hindquarters and legs, and long, brown hair on the head, neck, and <b>shoulders.</b> <b>In</b> the summer, the coat turns almost completely white or sandy blonde. Their head is marked with brown or black patches that form an 'X' over their noses. They have scraggly beards and prominent red nostrils. Long, black hairs stick out between their curved and spiralling horns, ending in a short mane on the neck.|$|E
5|$|Typically found growing solitary, {{in groups}} or in {{clusters}} under hardwood trees, the fungus produces fruit {{bodies in the}} summer and autumn. In the New England area of the United States, mycologist Howard Bigelow has noted it to grow on road <b>shoulders</b> <b>in</b> grass near oaks; it also has a predilection for growing on sloping creek banks. In Malaysia, it is found growing on the soil in forests, mostly under species of Shorea (rainforest trees in the family Dipterocarpaceae). C.lateritius has been reported from the Western Ghats, Kerala, India, forming ectomycorrhizal association with endemic tree species like Vateria indica, Hopea parviflora, Diospyros malabarica, Myristica malabarica in semi-evergreen to evergreen forests.|$|E

5|$|Lyon later {{apologized to}} the House as a whole, {{claiming}} he had not known it was in session when he confronted Griswold, and meant no breach of decorum or disrespect to the body; he also provided a written letter of apology. Not satisfied with the apology, on February 15, 1798, Griswold retaliated by attacking Lyon with a wooden cane, beating him about the head and <b>shoulders</b> <b>in</b> view of other representatives on the House floor. Lyon retreated to a fire pit and defended himself with the tongs until other Congressmen broke up the fight, with several pulling Griswold by his legs {{to get him to}} let go of Lyon. Although the committee appointed to investigate recommended censure of both Lyon and Griswold, the House as a whole rejected the motion. The issue was resolved when both Lyon and Griswold promised the House that they would keep the peace and remain on good behavior.|$|E
5|$|Not one of {{the marchers}} even raised an arm {{to fend off the}} blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on {{unprotected}} skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken <b>shoulders.</b> <b>In</b> two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.|$|E

25|$|Bejant is a {{term used}} to refer to first year male students; females being {{described}} as Bejantines. Second-year students are known as a Semis, a student in their third year may be referred to as a Tertian, and in their final year as a Magistrand. These terms are thought to be unique to St Andrews. When wearing their traditional red gowns, students in each year may be identified according to the way they wear their gowns. In the first year, the gown is worn on the <b>shoulders,</b> <b>in</b> the second year it is worn slightly off the <b>shoulders.</b> <b>In</b> the third year arts students wear their gowns off their left shoulders, and science students off their right shoulders. Finally, fourth years wear their gowns right down to their elbows, ready to shed their scarlet gowns for the black graduation gown. The gown is never to be joined at the top as this is considered bad luck.|$|E

25|$|A {{black and}} cream queen {{with a short}} wig and braided tail. She is aloof and {{somewhat}} mysterious. She is often assumed to be Abyssinian, given her unusual markings and exotic short-haired appearance. Her costume is smooth and form-fitting and her make up is fairly simple, without warmers or fluff on her <b>shoulders.</b> <b>In</b> the film version, when not actually participating in a group performance she would strike poses reminiscent of ancient Egyptian paintings, and she was Mr. Mistoffelees' assistant in his magic trick to rescue Old Deuteronomy.|$|E

At Unforgiven, Triple H beat Orton to regain the World Heavyweight Championship, with help from Flair, Batista, and Jonathan Coachman. Orton's feud with Evolution continued until Survivor Series where Triple H, Batista, Gene Snitsky, and Edge were defeated by Orton, Maven, Chris Jericho, and Chris Benoit in a Survivor Series match for control of Raw over the following month.|$|E
25|$|A woman's legs {{can remain}} flat or raised toward her chest, or {{wrapped around the}} {{penetrating}} partner at various heights: {{at the back of}} the legs, at the buttocks or back or over the <b>shoulders,</b> <b>in</b> a position called the Wiener Auster or Viennese oyster. In the higher leg positions the woman's legs may need some support, which may be achieved by crossing the ankles behind the partner or resting on his shoulders. She may also hold them with her hands or cross her arms around them at the knees. Some are flexible enough to cross the legs behind their heads. Alternatively, her partner may hold her legs up. Separating straight legs carry the risk of muscle pull of thigh muscles. The laying by the partner on raised legs puts excessive pressure on the woman's back.|$|E
