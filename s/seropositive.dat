5|$|During {{the period}} of time of removal of thiomersal, the CDC and AAP asked doctors to delay the birth dose of {{hepatitis}} B vaccine in children not at risk for hepatitis. This decision, though following the precautionary principle, nevertheless sparked confusion, controversy and some harm. Approximately 10% of hospitals suspended the use of hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, and one child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of it. Similarly, a study found that the number of hospitals who failed to properly vaccinate infants of hepatitis B <b>seropositive</b> mothers rose by over 6 times. This is a potential negative outcome given the high probability that infants who acquire hepatitis B infection at birth will develop the infection in a chronic form and possibly liver cancer.|$|E
5|$|This is {{believed}} to be due to the increased exposure of mucosal tissue to potential infection sites. Transmission risk from infected female to male is around 4–5% annually. Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50%. Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios, meaning the infected partner will be <b>seropositive</b> but symptom-free by about 50%. Condom use also reduces the transmission risk significantly. Condom use is much more effective at preventing male-to-female transmission than vice versa. Previous HSV-1 infection may reduce the risk for acquisition of HSV-2 infection among women by a factor of three, although the one study that states this has a small sample size of 14 transmissions out of 214 couples.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{development}} of a risk assessment tool for long-term hepatocellular carcinoma risk would {{be helpful in identifying}} high-risk patients and providing information of clinical consultation. Methods: The model derivation and validation cohorts consisted of 975 and 572 anti-HCV <b>seropositives,</b> respectively. The model included age, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), the ratio of aspirate aminotransferase to ALT, serum HCV RNA levels and cirrhosis status and HCV genotype. Two risk prediction models were developed: one was for all-anti-HCV <b>seropositives,</b> and the other was for anti-HCV <b>seropositives</b> with detectable HCV RNA. The Cox’s proportional hazards models were utilized to estimate regression coefficients of HCC risk predictors to derive risk scores.

40|$|Background-: Very {{few studies}} have {{measured}} disease penetrance and prognostic factors of Chagas cardiomyopathy among asymptomatic Trypanosoma cruzi-infected persons. Methods and Results-: We performed a retrospective cohort study among initially healthy blood donors with an index T cruzi-seropositive donation and age-, sex-, and period-matched seronegatives in 1996 to 2002 in the Brazilian cities of São Paulo and Montes Claros. In 2008 to 2010, all subjects underwent medical history, physical examination, ECGs, and echocardiograms. ECG and echocardiogram results were classified by blinded core laboratories, and records with abnormal results were reviewed by a blinded panel of 3 cardiologists who adjudicated the outcome of Chagas cardiomyopathy. Associations with Chagas cardiomyopathy were tested with multivariate logistic regression. Mean follow-up time between index donation and outcome assessment was 10. 5 years for the <b>seropositives</b> and 11. 1 years for the seronegatives. Among 499 T cruzi <b>seropositives,</b> 120 (24 %) had definite Chagas cardiomyopathy, and among 488 T cruzi seronegatives, 24 (5 %) had cardiomyopathy, for an incidence difference of 1. 85 per 100 person-years attributable to T cruzi infection. Of the 120 <b>seropositives</b> classified as having Chagas cardiomyopathy, only 31 (26 %) presented with ejection fraction < 50 %, and only 11 (9 %) were classified as New York Heart Association class II or higher.

25|$|Bone marrow {{transplantation}} {{usually requires}} that the recipient's own bone marrow be destroyed (myeloablation).

The immunosuppressive agents employed in allogeneic transplants for the prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease further increase the risk of opportunistic infection. Immunosuppressive drugs are given for a minimum of 6-months after a transplantation, or much longer if required for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease. Transplant patients lose their acquired immunity, for example immunity to childhood diseases such as measles or polio. For this reason transplant patients must be re-vaccinated with childhood vaccines once they are off immunosuppressive medications.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} before, {{these results}} of increased proportions of people <b>seropositive</b> for the parasite {{in cases of}} these neurological disorders do not necessarily indicate a causal relationship between the infection and disorder. It {{is also important to}} mention that in 2016 a population-representative birth cohort study which was done, to test a hypothesis that toxoplasmosis is related to impairment in brain and behaviour measured by a range of phenotypes including neuropsychiatric disorders, poor impulse control, personality and neurocognitive deficits.

500|$|The risk of {{transmission}} from mother to baby is highest {{if the mother}} becomes infected {{around the time of}} delivery (30% to 60%), since insufficient time will have occurred for the generation and transfer of protective maternal antibodies before the birth of the child.

To prevent neonatal infections, seronegative women are recommended to avoid unprotected oral-genital contact with an HSV-1-seropositive partner and conventional sex with a partner having a genital infection during the last trimester of pregnancy. Mothers infected with HSV are advised to avoid procedures that would cause trauma to the infant during birth (e.g. fetal scalp electrodes, forceps, and vacuum extractors) and, should lesions be present, to elect caesarean section to reduce exposure of the child to infected secretions in the birth canal. The use of antiviral treatments, such as acyclovir, given from the 36th week of pregnancy, limits HSV recurrence and shedding during childbirth, thereby reducing the need for caesarean section.|$|E

The age-adjusted {{relative}} risk for AIDS among CMV <b>seropositives</b> was 2. 4 (P = 0. 03). In order to determine how this adverse effect is mediated, the mean rate of decline in serial CD 4 + lymphocyte counts was studied. CD 4 + lymphocyte counts tended to decline more rapidly in CMV <b>seropositives</b> than in seronegatives (- 0. 087 x 10 (9) /l per annum versus - 0. 082 x 10 (9) /l per annum), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. The average CD 4 + lymphocyte count at the time of HIV seroconversion was estimated to be similar in CMV <b>seropositives</b> and negatives, because in HIV- 1 -negative haemophiliacs the CD 4 + counts were virtually identical, after adjustment for age (0. 94 x 10 (9) /l and 0. 97 x 10 (9) /l, respectively). The median CD 4 + cell count at which AIDS developed was higher in the CMV-seropositive group (0. 07 x 10 (9) /l) than in the seronegative group (0. 04 x 10 (9) /l), but this difference did not reach statistical significance. We conclude from these findings that the adverse effect of CMV is not wholly mediated via a more rapid loss of CD 4 + cells. We discuss other processes that may be mediated by CMV, such as a functional deficiency of residual CD 4 + cells, or dissemination of HIV in other organs, which may be important in determining the earlier onset of AIDS among CMV-seropositive subjects...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{presented}} thesis was {{to analyse}} the sarcoptic mange of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) in the urban area of Berlin. From 1456 red foxes sent to the Institut für Lebensmittel, Arzneimittel und Tierseuchen (ILAT) during the examination period between 1996 and 1999 within the vaccination campaign against rabies 1025 sera were available. In the own investigations the findings at necropsy concerning to the clinical picture of mange were compared {{to the results of}} the detection of antibodies against Sarcoptes-mites The ýcut-offý was established with 118 sera from clinical healthy silver foxes. The positive sera were taken from 198 clinically diseased red foxes. While 19, 3 % of the foxes had clinical mange, the amount of the <b>seropositives</b> amounted to 43, 6 %. Only 7, 5 % of the animals with clinical mange did not show any antibodies against Sarcoptes-mites. While the cases of clinical mange as well as the percentage of the <b>seropositives</b> among the adult foxes were doubling over the years, the findings of clinical mange and antibodies against Sarcoptes-mites among the juvenile foxes almost remained constant during the examination period. In contrast to that, splitted into quarters, a rise of the clinical and serological proof of mange was noted among the young foxes, whereas the incidence of mange and <b>seropositives</b> among the adult foxes nearly remained at the same level. Concerning to the incidence of clinical mange and the proof of antibodies against Sarcoptes-mites with regard to origin and age of the foxes, the large outskirt districts which have bigger forest areas like Zehlendorf, Spandau, Köpenick, Reinickendorf and Pankow showed the highest population densities and thus the highest infestation rates. The percentage of the animals that were serologically positive was almost double of the ones that showed clinical pictures. <br...|$|R
