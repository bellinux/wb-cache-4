5|$|Halkett's first {{design was}} a {{collapsible}} and inflatable boat made of rubber-impregnated cloth. When deflated, {{the hull of}} the boat could be worn as a cloak, the oar used as a walking stick, and the sail as an umbrella.

5|$|The ideal {{solution}} was a proximity fuze inside an artillery shell, {{but there were}} numerous technical difficulties with this. The radar set {{had to be made}} <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> inside a shell, and its glass vacuum tubes had to first withstand the 20,000 g force of being fired from a gun, and then 500 rotations per second in flight. A special Section T of NDRC was created, chaired by Tuve, with Parsons as special assistant to Bush and liaison between NDRC and BuOrd.|$|E
25|$|The Radio Science Experiment (REX) used an ultrastable crystal {{oscillator}} (essentially a calibrated crystal in a miniature oven) and some additional electronics to conduct radio science investigations using the communications channels. These are <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> {{on a single}} card. Because there are two redundant communications subsystems, there are two, identical REX circuit boards.|$|E

5000|$|A {{prevalent}} {{system needs}} <b>enough</b> memory <b>to</b> hold its entire state in RAM (the [...] "prevalent hypothesis").

25|$|A {{multiple}} unit has powered wheels {{throughout the whole}} train. These are used for rapid transit and tram systems, {{as well as many}} both short- and long-haul passenger trains. A railcar is a single, self-powered car, and may be electrically-propelled or powered by a diesel engine. Multiple units have a driver's cab {{at each end of the}} unit, and were developed following the ability to build electric motors and engines <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> under the coach. There are only a few freight {{multiple unit}}s, most of which are high-speed post trains.|$|E
25|$|Self-expandable {{metallic}} stents are cylindrical in shape, and are devised in {{a number}} of diameters and lengths to suit the application in question. They typically consist of cross-hatched, braided or interconnecting rows of metal that are assembled into a tube-like structure. SEMS, when unexpanded, are <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> through the channel of an endoscope, which is meant for delivery of devices for therapeutic endoscopy. They expand through a deployment device which is placed {{at the end of the}} SEMS, and are held in place against the wall of the luminal surface by friction.|$|E
25|$|Many {{temperate}} {{fish have}} specific local diet requirements, while others, will eat {{just about any}} crustacean or frozen foods. Some fish should not be kept with fish <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into its mouth, crabs or mollusks. Similarly some crabs can not be kept with some mollusks, while other fish, crabs, mollusks and echinoderms may be compatible with each other. It takes experience before one can successfully gauge the compatibility of the fish and invertebrates in one's area. Due to it being such a localized hobby in the United States, not many people go the route of local tanks which are far more popular in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|There is also {{a company}} spun off from Lite-PC that {{produces}} Windows 98 and Me installations which are <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> easily <b>fit</b> on embedded microchips, as small as 8MB, [...] using 98EOS. There are also many free alternatives to this, such as Mindows and Nano98, which can provide either smaller file sizes, or more broad functionality.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} that Versions 11 and 12 were released, the {{capabilities}} and capacities of portable devices typically required down-conversion of the bit-rates of the files placed on the portable devices. Thus, Sync down-conversion was turned on by default. This was to ensure playability of the files {{and to ensure that}} the file sizes were <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> efficiently <b>fit</b> a reasonably large selection of songs on the portable device.|$|R

Units were <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> single-engine day fighters and night fighters. Fitted generally {{at first but}} later in the war only to aircraft expected to operate at night. In larger aircraft usually paired with Fug 102 due to its max height limitation.|$|R
25|$|Therefore, the director's wishes {{were for}} it {{to look like an}} actual mutated fish-like creature, rather than have a more fantastical design. In the opening scenes of the film, two {{fishermen}} presumably encounter the creature whilst it is still <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> in one of their cups; suggestive of its humble, more realistic origins. The monster also exhibits frontal limbs similar to amphibians' legs. This element of its design seems to have been more a choice of functionality on the designers' part as the monster needed to be able to run and perform certain acrobatic movements during the film. For a genre film monster, the creature's size is rather small, only {{about the size of a}} truck. Also unlike in many other monster-themed films, the creature is fully visible from early on in the film, sometimes for large stretches of time and even in broad daylight, which earned the film some critical praise.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the design, thanks {{in no small part}} to the passionate enthusiasm of Mignet himself, the original HM.14 revealed design flaws that could lead to an unrecoverable and often fatal dive under certain conditions; when the front wing was put in a high attack angle for climbing, the high-speed flow of air deflected by the front wing went to the rear wing upper surface, greatly increasing the rear wing's lift, and putting the nose down, the instinctive reaction of pilot being pulling even more the stick, this worsened the situation, as the way to go out of this 'vicious circle' was reducing the front wing incidence, as to command a nose down descent. Also some homebuilders attempted to simplify construction by modifying components such as the wings tips curving up, resulting in extremely dangerous airplanes and deadly accidents that forced the air authorities to ban building more of them. Studies in the UK and France revealed the problem (the HM.14 was <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> in wind tunnels in both countries usually used for scale models of larger aircraft) and corrections were made to the design. Unfortunately, the wave of bad publicity created by the crashes dogged Mignet {{for the rest of his}} life and continues to be associated with the design today despite the fact that the basic Mignet configuration has proven to be safe in hundreds of successful homebuilt aircraft and factory built microlights.|$|E
500|$|In 1938, Oliphant became {{involved}} {{with the development of}} radar, then still a secret. While visiting prototype radar stations, he realised that shorter-wavelength radio waves were needed urgently, especially if there was to be any chance of building a radar set <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into an aircraft. In August 1939, he took a small group to Ventnor, on the Isle of Wight, to examine the Chain Home system first hand.

50|$|N,N-Diisopropylethylamine, or Hünigs base, DIPEA or DIEA, is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an amine. It {{is used in}} organic chemistry as a base.

5000|$|The IBM 610 was {{introduced}} in 1957. It was <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> easily <b>fit</b> in an office. It {{was designed to be}} used in a normal office, without any special electrical or air conditioning requirements. It used vacuum tubes, a magnetic drum, and punched paper tape readers and punchers. The input was from a keyboard and output was to an IBM electric typewriter, at eighteen characters per second. It {{was one of the first}} (if not the first) computers to be controlled from a keyboard. The term [...] "auto-point" [...] referred to the ability to automatically adjust the decimal point in floating-point arithmetic.|$|R
50|$|A less {{expensive}} binding method is that used for paperback books (sometimes called softback or softcover). Most paperbacks are bound with paper or light cardboard, though other materials (such as plastic) are used. The covers are flexible and usually {{bound to the}} pages using glue (perfect binding). Some small paperback books are sub-classified as pocketbooks. These paperbacks are smaller than usual - <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> barely <b>fit</b> into a pocket (especially the back pocket of one's trousers). However, this capacity <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into a pocket diminishes with increasing number of pages and increasing thickness of the book. Such a book may still be designated as a pocketbook.|$|R
500|$|From medieval times, beagle {{was used}} as a generic {{description}} for the smaller hounds, though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed. Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of Edward II and Henry VII, who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> on a glove, and Queen Elizabeth I kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood [...] at the shoulder. <b>Small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> in a [...] "pocket" [...] or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt. The larger hounds would run the prey to ground, then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush. Elizabeth I referred to the dogs as her singing beagles and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups. 19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and {{it is possible that the}} two names refer to the same small variety. In George Jesse's Researches into the History of the British Dog from 1866, the early 17th-century poet and writer Gervase Markham is quoted referring to the beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the: [...] Standards for the Pocket Beagle were drawn up as late as 1901; these genetic lines are now extinct, although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety.|$|E
500|$|Syzygy tablebases were {{developed}} by Ronald de Man, released in April 2013, in a form optimized for use by a chess program during search. [...] This variety consists of two tables per endgame: a smaller WDL table (win-draw-loss) which contains knowledge of the 50-move rule, and a larger DTZ table (distance to zero ply, i.e. pawn move or capture). [...] The WDL tables were designed to be <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> on a solid-state drive for quick access during search, whereas the DTZ form is for use at the root position to choose the game-theoretically quickest win instead of performing a search. Syzygy tablebases are available for all 6 piece endings, and are now supported by many top engines, including Komodo, Deep Fritz, Houdini, and Stockfish.|$|E
500|$|The delay enabled Spain to take {{advantage}} of experience gained by Britain with the world's first commissioned all-big-gun battleship, , and by the United States with its own new battleship, [...] The Spanish Navy was principally concerned with defending its three main naval bases: Ferrol, Cádiz, and Cartagena. Of secondary importance was the need to keep the new battleship design tightly constrained due to the frail Spanish economy and industrial sector. A third constraint was the need to build ships <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> in existing dockyard facilities, since there were insufficient funds to both build larger battleships and to enlarge the navy's dockyards. As a result, the design requirements called for relatively heavy offensive power with minimal range and armor protection. The Navy began discussing the design requirements with Armstrong Whitworth and Vickers in 1907 well before the law was actually passed. On 5 September 1907, Vickers provided a proposed design for a 15,000-ton battleship armed with eight 12-inch guns. This design was the basis for the requirements for the design competition, which was issued on 21 April 1908.|$|E
50|$|North Korean {{missiles}} {{can serve}} to deliver various types of warheads, including WMD. It is possible that up to three Rodong-1 missiles are fitted with nuclear warheads. In a similar manner to the initial Chinese nuclear doctrine, nuclear weapons are being stored separately, and would only be mounted on missiles after an order of the supreme commander (Kim Jong-un). Despite the claims by numerous media that North Korea has not yet created nuclear warheads <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be <b>fit</b> in a missile, reports surfaced in April 2009, according to which North Korea has miniaturized warheads, capable of being mounted on its missiles. The most suitable nuclear weapons delivery system is the Rodong-1, which has been successfully tested many times.|$|R
50|$|These 'hearing glasses' {{incorporate}} a directional microphone capability: four microphones {{on each side}} of the frame effectively work as two directional microphones, which are able to discern between sound coming from the front and sound coming from the sides or back of the user.

500|$|Martin Ahlgren {{joined the}} series as {{director}} of photography for the season, deciding to [...] "go {{in a slightly different}} direction" [...] than the first season, but retaining [...] "the yellowish street light color that gave season one a very distinct style". Ahlgren filmed season two in 4K resolution on RED Dragon cameras, and tried to use in-shot lighting such as lamps and car headlights, as well as [...] "4×4 Light Blankets—flexible sheets of LED that was <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into tight locations and light enough that it could be taped to a wall, yet outputs a very nice soft light that can be adjusted from daylight to tungsten color".

An Ultimate Arm, [...] "a motorized crane mounted on a Porsche Cayenne", was used for the sequence, a break from the series' usual handheld and steadicam operations. The chase was shot over two nights in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, with the interior of the car then filmed on a green screen stage, a rarity for the series, [...] "to give the actors a better environment to act in".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} the first Hollywood {{production}} to be filmed with the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED Epic camera and was shot in 3-D at 5K resolution.

I can say for certainty the camera does exist and boy is it ready for primetime, as a matter of fact it's a true game changer." [...] Schwartzman felt that the 3D would have been impossible without it. He said, [...] "I can tell you without these cameras it would be impossible to move a 3D rig in the ways that THIS story demands, if Jim and the crew hadn't made these cameras available to us I don't think we could have shot this movie the way our director envisioned it in 3D." [...] Webb wanted cameras <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> on the rigs and swing around very fast, saying that the [...] "RED Epic cameras were the right cameras to do that." [...] Webb continued that [...] "you need to shoot it with a level of velocity and 3D cameras can be very large... and so we need those cameras to mount on rigs that could fly to the air and run to the streets in a certain pace. That allowed us to do it." [...] The Amazing Spider-Man climax was filmed in a 1:78:1 aspect ratio for its IMAX DMR release.|$|E

50|$|The FF were {{a series}} of 20mm autocannon {{introduced}} by Oerlikon in the late 1920s.

50|$|The thermoreactor has {{a square}} cross section and very compact {{dimensions}} (10 x 4 x 4 in). Thermoreactors are <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be <b>fitted</b> within wing's body as an array {{next to each}} other. Each thermoreactor develops a thrust of 170 newtons. The Xplorair PX200 includes 20 thermoreactors: 7 in each front wing, and 6 in aircraft tail. During take-off and landing, the 20 thermoreactors work together, providing 3,400 newtons of thrust. The cruise altitude of 9000 ft is reached in 4 minutes for 15 kg of fuel burnt. Only one thermoreactor at each front wing's tip would then be needed to maintain a cruise speed of 125 mph. The simultaneous activation of all thermoreactors during flight is still possible and would bring the speed to 400 mph, {{at the cost of}} a poorer fuel efficiency.|$|R

40|$|We {{have built}} an eight node SMP cluster called COMPaS (Cluster Of Multi-Processor Systems), each node {{of which is}} a quadprocessor Pentium Pro PC.

We designed a hybrid programming model in order to take advantage of locality in each SMP node. Intra-node computations utilize a multi-threaded programming style (Solaris threads) and inter-node programming is based on message passing and remote memory operations. In this paper we report on this hybrid shared memory/distributed memory programming on COMPaS and its preliminary evaluation. The performance of COMPaS is affected by data size and access patterns, and the proportion of inter-node communication.

50|$|Small {{specimens}} necessarily require intense illumination, {{especially at}} high magnifications, {{and this is}} usually provided by a fibre-optic light source. Fiber optics utilize halogen lamps which provide high light output for a given power input. The lamps are <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be <b>fitted</b> easily near the microscope, although they often need cooling to ameliorate high temperatures from the bulb. The fibre-optic stalk gives the operator much freedom in choosing appropriate lighting conditions for the sample. The stalk is encased in a sheath that is easy to move and manipulate to any desired position. The stalk is normally unobtrusive when the lit end is near the specimen, so usually does {{not interfere with the}} image in the microscope. Examination of fracture surfaces frequently need oblique lighting so as to highlight surface features during fractography, and fibre-optic lights are ideal for this purpose. Several such light stalks can be used for the same specimen, so increasing the illumination yet further.|$|R
50|$|Numerous European {{manufacturers}} {{who were}} not licensed to build Italian-designed scooters, developed their own models {{in an attempt to}} compete. In 1951 the automotive manufacturer Hans Glas in Bavaria launched his own design of scooter, the Goggo, initially with a 123 cc engine but from 1953 with more powerful 147 cc and 198 cc engines. In 1953 the West German aircraft maker Heinkel launched the Tourist, initially with a 149 cc engine but from 1954 enlarged to 174 cc. However, West German designers tended to use conventional motorcycle-type engines which were not <b>small</b> or light <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> beside the rear wheel.
