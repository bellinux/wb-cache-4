They need to talk to somebody about it. Trust somebody enough to sit down and talk about something that isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime. Doing it isn't just a crime, it's a horrible thing, it doesn't know when to quit and it can't be stopped easily once it starts." [...] He also conducted an interview with French writer Stéphane Bourgoin in 1991.|$|E

He described the Brenda's Got a Baby continuation as: [...] Brenda has her baby and the concept is basically giving you what happened after she left the baby in a trashcan and the child grew up. I basically do a continuation of that record. The child actually grows up to be a prostitute.

So, I was taking like, six literature courses. So I was taking like Milton and Shakespeare, and John Donne and Chaucer, like all at the same time. So that was pretty much pervasive in my life. Like, all that old literature. So, I mean, if there is <b>somebody</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> that would actually put the time into reading hardcore lyrics, which I doubt there is, then, you know, {{there is a lot of}} Shakespeare images in there, just because that was what I was reading at the time." ...|$|E

It is difficult to say which was more instrumental in Connors becoming a champion. ... Though smaller than most of his competitors, Connors didn't let it bother him, making up for a lack of size with determination." [...] Of his own competitive nature Connors has said, [...] "There's always <b>somebody</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> who's willing to push it that extra inch, or mile, and that was me. (Laughter) I didn't care if it took me 30 minutes or five hours. If you beat me, you had to be the best, or the best you had that day. But that was my passion for the game.

5000|$|The {{game is a}} side-scroller beat 'em up and {{is broken}} up into four levels. Players control the Norse god Thor and unleash his {{lightning}} magic and powerful hammer, Mjölnir, to blast any foes in his way. As the game progresses, Thor gains XP which increases his character stats; however, the stats are not customizable, leading Joystiq to comment, [...] "leveling seems to exist {{for the sole purpose}} of encouraging replays. <b>Somebody</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> will want to achieve a level 100 character, right?" [...] Each level introduces new types of enemies and new complicated platform layouts. Treasures are hidden in certain levels which, if found, grant Thor powers such as extra health and magic regeneration, or the ability to double jump. Levels must be repeated multiple times both to find the treasures and to gain enough experience to defeat tougher enemies in later levels. To explain the Norse mythology present in the game, as the game progresses players unlock dictionary entries which can be accessed through the extras section of the game's menu.|$|E

It's the best time of your life," [...] when it's really not. Being young is hard. Everything's in front of you for the first time. Those things that are in front of you seem so much bigger than they do when you're looking back on them. I'm 32 now and looking back on my teenage years and before, a lot of it doesn't seem as hard as it did then because now it's behind me and I hardly remember it. You get the responsibilities of the world as an adult. However, when you were in high school, there was nothing bigger than that test on Friday. Now, you don't even remember what test it was.

In it, Beyoncé stated that she is excited, yet nervous about the shows. She said [...] "at Revel is like going back to my old job and it's a little strange." [...] She continued saying that it was vital for her not to lose herself and still have her own passion even after she became a mother, something she was accomplishing with the shows. Director/Choreographer Frank Gatson Jr. said that the show had the potential of being the greatest show of Beyoncé's career. The second behind-the-scenes video detailing the event premiered the next day, on May 25, 2012. During the video, Beyoncé stated that she tried to bring back to life her alter ego Sasha Fierce for the show. She further said that she is anxious about the show as her team was doing it in two weeks, unlike her previous shows which were prepared in two months. Beyoncé further revealed the concept of the show saying, [...] "What I'm trying to say with the show ... yes, I had a baby, but it just made me more grounded". The concert was also called Back to Business referencing Beyoncé's song [...] "Run the World (Girls)".|$|E
