30|$|This section covers some of {{the more}} basic notions {{associated}} with the complex-valued random <b>signals</b> <b>field</b> and introduces a new class of signals, called widely factorizable.

2500|$|The {{absorption}} and emission {{cross sections}} of the ions can be modeled as ellipsoids with the major axes aligned at random in all directions in different glass sites. [...] The random distribution of {{the orientation of the}} ellipsoids in a glass produces a macroscopically isotropic medium, but a strong pump laser induces an anisotropic distribution by selectively exciting those ions that are more aligned with the optical field vector of the pump. Also, those excited ions aligned with the <b>signal</b> <b>field</b> produce more stimulated emission. The change in gain is thus dependent on the alignment of the polarizations of the pump and signal lasers – i.e. whether the two lasers are interacting with the same sub-set of dopant ions or not.|$|E
2500|$|These {{two sets}} {{intersect}} at exactly one point. [...] There {{is only one}} possible <b>signal</b> <b>field</b> that both has the correct intensity to match the data trace and fits the mathematical form dictated by the nonlinear interaction. [...] To find that point, which will give the pulse {{we are trying to}} measure, generalized projections is used. [...] The generalized projections algorithm operates in this electric field space. [...] At each step, we find the closest point to the current guess point that will satisfy the constraint for the other set. [...] That is, the current guess is “projected” onto the other set. [...] This closest point becomes the new current guess, and the closest point on the first set is found. [...] By alternating between projecting onto the mathematical constraint set and projecting onto the data constraint set, we eventually end up at the solution.|$|E
2500|$|FROG and {{autocorrelation}} {{share the}} idea of combining a pulse with itself in a nonlinear medium. [...] Since a nonlinear medium will only produce the desired signal when both pulses are present {{at the same time}} (i.e. “optical gating”), varying the delay between the pulse copies and measuring the signal at each delay gives a vague estimate of the pulse length. [...] Autocorrelators measure a pulse by measuring the intensity of the nonlinear <b>signal</b> <b>field.</b> [...] Estimating the pulse length requires assuming a pulse shape, and the phase of the pulse electric field cannot be measured at all. [...] FROG extends this idea by measuring the spectrum of the signal at each delay (hence “frequency-resolved”), instead of just the intensity. [...] This measurement creates a spectrogram of the pulse, which can be used to determine the complex electric field as a function of time or frequency as long as the nonlinearity of the medium is known.|$|E
