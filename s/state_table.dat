The musicians ceased playing, and began to chatter; the pages dashed about to remove the service, and everybody was in motion. Observing that your ---- was standing undecided what to do, I walked into the railed area, brushed past the gorgeous <b>state</b> <b>table,</b> and gave her my arm. She laughed, and said {{it had all been}} very magnificent and amusing, but that some one had stolen her shawl! A few years before, I had purchased for her a merino shawl, of singular fineness, simplicity, and beauty. It was now old, and she had worn it on this occasion, because she distrusted the dirt of a palace; and laying it carelessly by her side, {{in the course of the}} evening she had found in its place a very common thing of the same colour. The thief was deceived by its appearance your ---- being dressed for an evening party, and had probably mistaken it for a cashmere. So much for the company one meets at court! Too much importance, however, must not be attached to this little contretems, as people of condition are apt to procure tickets for such places, and to give them to their femmes de chambre. Probably, half the women present, the [...] "jeunes et jolies" [...] excepted, were of this class. But mentioning this affair to the old Princesse de ----, she edified me by an account of the manner in which Madame la Comtesse de ---- had actually appropriated to the service of her own pretty person the cachemire of Madame la Baronne de ----, in the royal presence; and how there was a famous quarrel, Ã  l'outrance, about it; so I suspend my opinions as to the quality of the thief.|$|E
