5|$|To promote sustainability, {{the site}} was {{selected}} directly adjacent to an already used part of a major ski area. It was also designed to minimize vegetation and the ecological footprint in the area. For energy efficiency, trees were retained to cast shade with weather protection and a shading system used to cover parts of the track. The track itself is painted white to maintain low temperatures while minimizing energy demand on the refrigeration system. Waste heat from the refrigeration plant is captured and reused to heat buildings on-site, and could provide other heat uses in the future. Any wood waste created from <b>site</b> <b>clearing</b> activities during venue construction was composted for reuse. Other on-site buildings also followed similar green building design principles.|$|E

By late November, the first elevated guideway segment was completed and column erection at the station was near completion. The mezzanine and the main structural elements of the station were completed between late 2005 and early 2007. The station and segment through Tukwila were declared substantially complete by PCL Construction in March 2008 and all major work at the station was finished by late June.|$|E
500|$|Four of {{the five}} {{intermediate}} stations between Old Saybrook and New Haven were rebuilt with accessible platforms between 2004 and 2008, but rebuilding at Westbrook was delayed due to environmental and cost issues. No site was available until Westbrook and ConnDOT traded the new station site on Norris Avenue for a highway garage site off Route 145. The controversial land swap was begun in 2004 but was not finalized until 2006, and town operations were not moved to the Route 145 site until September 2011. <b>Site</b> <b>clearing</b> began in November 2011, and ground was broken for the $14.4 million station in January 2012. [...] A new station with a larger 210-space lot and platforms on both tracks opened on March 25, 2014, with full bidirectional service to the station beginning on May 11.|$|E

The Midway Carousel and Calypso were {{relocated}} in October {{to other areas of}} the park to make room for Raptor. Footers also began to be poured that month. The lift hill was topped off in December with track construction continuing through January 1994. The first trains were tested about two months later in March. Final preparations were made in March with the entrance plaza being built and [...] of midway replaced. Media day was held on May 6 before the ride opened to the public the next day for the first time. The ride was originally painted with dark green supports, bright green track and unpainted rails. It was repainted for the 2002 season and the rails were painted dark green, matching the supports.|$|E
500|$|<b>Site</b> <b>clearing</b> and {{foundation}} work {{would have been}} scheduled to begin after completion of the diversion work in the seventh year of the project. The first pouring of concrete was scheduled for the project's eighth year, {{and work on the}} powerhouse would have begun in the 11th year. Owing to the large size of the reservoir, engineers estimated that the diversion tunnels would be closed in the 13th year, allowing construction to pace the filling of the new lake. The reservoir would have reached a pool elevation of [...] in the 21st year, the dam would have been completed to elevation [...] in the 25th year, and the reservoir would have been filled to the full [...] level in the 31st year after the project's start.

The study aimed to measure the weight of remaining slash in different sites of Australian plantations harvested by cut-to-length (CTL) and whole tree (WTR) method. In some sites there was also additional biomass recovery from the harvesting residues. The study results showed that the remaining slash in <b>sites</b> <b>cleared</b> by CTL harvesting method (101. 7 GMt/ha) was higher than <b>sites</b> <b>clear</b> felled by WTR (6. 1 GMt/ha). Harvesting a proportion of remaining slash with biomass collection technologies resulted in lower weight of distributed slash on the sites harvested by CTL method. Based on the fraction test, the largest parts of the remaining slash was for stem wood and branches...|$|R
