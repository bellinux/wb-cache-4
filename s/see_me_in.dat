500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011, Lesnar {{announced}} that he was returning to action, stating, [...] "I feel like a new man. Healthy. Strong. I feel like I used to feel". His return match was scheduled to be at UFC 141 on December 30 in Las Vegas against former Strikeforce heavyweight champion Alistair Overeem. Overeem won the fight by way of technical knockout in the first round. The result of the fight remains controversial, as Overeem tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone prior to his next fight. Lesnar then announced his retirement from MMA, mentioning his struggles with diverticulitis and saying [...] "tonight was the last time you'll <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the octagon".|$|E
500|$|No {{lingering}} {{about was}} allowed, no gossiping {{with the other}} actors; the women’s dressing-rooms were {{on one side of}} the stage, the men's on the other, and when we were not actually playing we had to mount at once our respective narrow staircases– sheep rigorously separated from the goats! [...] Once, when my mother came to <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> London, expecting to find me dwelling in haunts of gilded luxury, and far down the road to perdition, I took her behind the scenes and showed her the arrangements for the actors and actresses, conventual in their austerity. ... I think there never was a theatre run on lines of such strict propriety; no breath of scandal ever touched it in all the twenty years of my experience. [...] Gilbert would suffer no loose word or gesture either behind the stage or on it, and watched over us young women like a dragon.|$|E

Q liked the idea, {{but at the same time}} wanted Nikita's dress sense to be [...] "toned down a bit" [...] because she is an assassin. In one scene in {{particular}} Q had to wear a red bikini in the pilot, which [...] "mortified" [...] her. She added [...] "that red bikini was the bane of my existence.

[...] However, Q did not have to cover her tattoos like she had to in the films, as it was in keeping with who the character is; a hardcore, street kid.|$|E
500|$|Although {{previously}} {{denied by}} him, Hindustan Times {{reported that the}} boxer took up {{a role in the}} part real part fictional Bollywood thriller tentatively titled One, to be directed by South Indian director Anand. The film was later reveated to be named Patiala Express, which is produced by Percept Limited. Shooting for the film was supposed to begin in early 2011. However, on 17 May 2011, Vijender got married to Archana Singh, a software engineer with an MBA degree, from Delhi. The wedding was solemnised in Delhi in a simple ceremony, and reception was organised at his native place Bhiwani. However, the wedding prompted the filmmakers to drop him from the project, as they felt that Vijender would not enjoy the same popularity among female fans. The film’s launch was widely reported in March 2011, and actor Govinda had confirmed Vijender’s debut with his daughter. Vijender refused to confirm if he has indeed been dropped from the film, saying that [...] "I have to concentrate on my boxing. Wait before you <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> films." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to being}} cast in Glee, Colfer had no {{professional}} acting experience. He originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Artie Abrams, performing [...] "Mr. Cellophane" [...] from the musical Chicago. Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him. To keep the number of students in the glee club constant, a character named Rajish was cut from the show. Kurt's name is inspired by the character Kurt von Trapp from The Sound of Music, a role that Colfer once played as a child. The Hummel surname comes from the popular German Hummel figurines; Colfer explained in an interview that Murphy thought he had their rosy-cheeked complexion. Murphy praised Colfer's abilities despite his lack of formal training, saying, [...] "I just thought he was so talented and gifted and unusual. I've never seen anyone who looks like him or acts like him or sounds like him. You'd think he’d been at Juilliard for six years but he hasn't." [...] Murphy saw something of himself in the young actor, a fact that Colfer says is [...] "completely mind-blowing". Colfer added, [...] "For him to <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> him, I can't even describe it." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{week before}} the tour began, Spears said of the show: [...] "I come from Broadway, so I {{want it to be}} very theatrical. The whole process for me is magical. Hopefully it will be {{something}} people have never even imagined or envisioned in their head. I was going through a run-through yesterday and was thinking, 'By the time I'm 30, there's not going to be anything left for me to do'". Initial rehearsals for the band started on September 9, 2001. She joined them later after rehearsing the choreography in Los Angeles. [...] The setlist was composed mostly by songs from Britney. She explained her decision in a press conference, saying, [...] "I just want my fans to <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a different light than they have ever seen me [...] before. This music I am singing right now is such a reflection of me and who I am. Hopefully [...] will come to the show and be inspired and have a lot of fun."

[...] Between Warren's [...] "heart-drenched" [...] words and dramatic melody writing and Dion's [...] "potent vocals straight from soulside, divadom has never sounded so mighty." [...] According to him, for fans of Dion's [...] "high-caliber" [...] power ballads, this is truly among the best ever and a highlight on All the Way... A Decade of Song. Longing for romantic attention, Dion sings, [...] "I want you [...] to need me, like the air you breathe/I {{want you to feel}} me, in everything/I want you to <b>see</b> <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> your every dream/The way that I taste you, feel you, breathe you, need you." [...] Taylor stated that Warren's trusty melody is wholly natural and free-flowing, while production from the usually rock-oriented Matt Serletic is [...] "sheer perfection". It all peaks from the glorious midsection through to the end, where Dion delivers exactly what we've come to expect: a crescendo as [...] "spine-tingling" [...] as those first few times we heard [...] "My Heart Will Go On".|$|E
500|$|... "Reunion" [...] is a noirish ballad that {{features}} reactive emotions by the narrators. Smith approached its recording {{as he would}} remixing a song, working with a demo of bass, guitar, and vocal parts at his own studio and incorporating house and techno elements. Midway, [...] "Reunion" [...] develops a refrain of [...] "did I ... see you ... <b>see</b> <b>me</b> ... <b>in</b> a new light?", and pulsating steel drums lead to a somber, rhythmic dance section. Its pulsating beat transitions into [...] "Sunset", a song about the pain shared by estranged ex-lovers. The song's muted beat adds tension to the narrative, which Calvert interprets to be [...] "the couple's final farewell – the beat serves to denote the passing of time." [...] "Sunset" [...] also has a subtle UK garage beat, funky house elements, and {{was inspired by the}} music from Smith's DJing gigs; Croft cited it as [...] "an example of the idea of a kind of song we're all really into, which is heartbreaking dance music". Consequence of Sound's Harley Brown views that [...] "Reunion" [...] and [...] "Sunset" [...] make up a congruous mix at [...] "the heart of the album", as Smith [...] "indie-streams these house varieties ... slowing down and alienating beats from their context so they’re even more universal, unobscured by their dance floor origins.|$|E

2500|$|On October 18, 1964, Jackie Mason {{allegedly}} gave Sullivan {{the finger}} on air. A {{tape of the}} incident shows Mason doing his stand-up comedy act and then looking toward Sullivan, commenting that Sullivan was signaling him. Sullivan was reportedly letting Mason know (by pointing two fingers) that he had only two minutes left, as CBS was about to cut away to show a speech by President Lyndon Johnson. Mason began working his own fingers into his act and pointed toward Sullivan with his middle finger slightly separated. After Mason left the stage, the camera then cut to a visibly angry Sullivan. Sullivan argued with Mason backstage, then terminated his contract. Mason denied knowingly giving Sullivan the middle finger, and Mason later claimed {{that he had never}} even heard of the gesture at that time. In retaliation, to protect the perceived threat to his career, Mason filed a libel suit at the New York Supreme Court, which he won. Sullivan publicly apologized to Mason when he appeared on the show two years later, in 1966. At that time, Mason opened his monologue by saying, [...] "It's a great thrill and a fantastic opportunity to <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> person again," [...] and impersonated Sullivan during his act. [...] Mason later appeared on the show five times: April 23, 1967; Feb. 25, 1968; Nov. 24, 1968; Jul. 22, 1969; and Aug. 31, 1969.|$|E
