40|$|This study {{explored}} whether financial {{leaders and}} institutional governing boards use <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> {{as a tool}} to inform decision making, solely as a compliance measurement tool, or not at all. The purpose of this qualitative study was two-fold to: (a) identify the use of <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> in strategic decision making, and (b) investigate how institutions use <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> to support governing boards in making strategic decisions. The data were obtained from a survey of 214 financial officers to identify the use of <b>financial</b> <b>indicators,</b> and in-depth interviews with leaders from six institutions who indicated strategic use of <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> to inform governing boards. ^ The findings indicated that most financial officers compute financial ratios which measure tuition dependency, enrollment trends, and institutional discount rates. The majority of financial officers, however, do not use <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> to inform decision making with their governing boards. A number of barriers confront financial officers including: lack of time, understanding and interest of the president and governing board, 2 ̆ 2 traditional think, 2 ̆ 2 and a culture that is slow to change. ^ Financial officers must obtain approval from the institution 2 ̆ 7 s president as the gatekeeper in order to focus on a specific <b>financial</b> <b>indicator</b> with the governing board. The <b>financial</b> <b>indicator</b> must be presented to the board in a consistent, clear, and transparent manner. The financial officer must be an excellent communicator in his/her delivery of financial data. The study supported findings from the literature that <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> must be linked to planning to promote strategy and create meaning in order to inform decision making. ^ These findings should be of interest to institutional leaders who seek ways to improve the use of <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> to inform strategic decision making. Additionally, the study contributed to identifying best practices to share with financial officers who persevere in advocating the use of <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> to create meaning and promote institutional financial health. ...|$|R

It offers a number of <b>financial</b> <b>indicators,</b> which should be assessed when determining the credit rating of competitor banks.

It reveals a necessity of comparing when conducting analysis of values of <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> of bank activity, which are rated, with relevant values by the group of banks and the whole banking system. In the result of application of the proposed methods it seems possible to assess positive and negative sides of activity of a specific bank compared to its competitors. Moreover, rather high values of analysed <b>financial</b> <b>indicators,</b> compared to other studied banks, could be used as weighty information when conducting PR campaigns carried out by the bank.

In order to analyze the feasibility of investing of the most representative companies in the pharmaceutical industry worldwide, I used a multiple regression model. The evolution of indicators showed that short-term investments depended on a more or less of them. Thus the impact of selected <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> together on short term investments proved to be stronger than the impact of each <b>financial</b> <b>indicator</b> in part on the explained variable.

However, {{there is a lack of}} studies aimed at identifying links between macroeconomic factors and <b>financial</b> performance <b>indicators</b> and explaining their variation over time. To serve that purpose, the factors of the macroeconomic environment that are most significant for certain economic activities have been identified and analysed to enable explaining the variation over time patterns of corporate <b>financial</b> <b>indicators.</b> The analysis covers economic performance, i. e. <b>financial</b> performance <b>indicators</b> and their links with macroeconomic factors, in 89 business sectors of Lithuania at a three-digit level of NACE 2 ed. The findings of the research indicate that the unemployment level in the country, the volume of export and import and the GDP are the most important macroeconomic factors that can be used to forecast different profitability, financial leverage, liquidity and other <b>financial</b> performance <b>indicators</b> of individual business sectors or companies.

40|$|The {{effect of}} bank capital {{structure}} and <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> on CI’s <b>financial</b> strength ratings: {{the case of}} the Middle East This paper aims to integrate the theory of bank financial performance with the practice of bank ratings. The paper studies the effect of bank capital structure and <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> in Middle Eastern commercial banks associated with high and low ratings issued by Capital Intelligence (CI). The authors also investigate how bank capital structure and <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> can be differentiated between banks with high and low ratings, using the multinomial logit technique. A sample of 65 rated commercial banks from eleven countries is used. The article focuses on commercial banks in order to avoid comparison problems between various types of banks. The data is taken from the Bankscope database and covers the period of 1994 - 2007. The results reveal that the <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> of the highly-rated banks are associated with decreases in the ratio of impaired loans to gross loans, the ratio of loan loss reserve to gross loans, the ratio of non-interest expenses to total assets, the ratio of net loans to deposits and short-term funding and the ratio of net loans to total assets. In contrast, these <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> are allied to an increase in the ratio of non-operating income to net income, the gap ratio, the interbank ratio and the equity ratio. The robustness of the results is quite obvious since the <b>financial</b> <b>indicators</b> associated with highly-rated banks are the opposite of those associated with low-rated banks. In view of the findings, some policy implications can be drawn that may be useful for bank management and policymakers in the Middle East region...|$|R
