In 1935 Schnabel, then an employee of American Dairies approached Lynwood Smith to request the use of an unused drying machine. When Smith asked Schnabel why he wanted to use the machine Schnabel answered [...] "…to dry grasses." [...] His answer led to a three-hour discussion in Smith's office. His experiments had indicated that the young grass shoots had to be dried quickly, which was the reason behind his request for the unused drying machine. This is the key finding that separates wheat grass grown and harvested at the jointing stage from cereal grasses grown in trays indoors or harvested at any other time in the growing process. The jointing process is why Schnabel’s wheat grass was superior in terms of total nutritional value. This still holds true today. Through his research and experiments, Dr. Schnabel found that in nearly every case, cereal grass contained a higher level of vitamins than other foods. With all the discoveries, people were clamoring for a way to increase the vitamins in their diets. Schnabel's Cerophyl was the answer. With the recommended 20 tablets per day, people could receive their minimum daily requirements of most of the known vitamins.|$|E

Proximate analysis of pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>kernels</b> flour and production of Sudanese sorghum bread (kisra) supplemented with various ratios (5 %, 10 % and 15 %) of pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>kernels</b> flour were carried out. Energy values, contents of minerals and amino acids were determined for raw flour of pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>kernels,</b> sorghum flour and their supplemented kisra product. The most significant (P≤ 0. 05) effect of supplemented kisra was the increase in protein content from 10. 6 % for the control kisra to 12. 6 %, 14. 7 % and 16. 5 % for kisra supplemented with 5 %, 10 % and 15 % pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>kernels</b> flour, respectively. The contents of crude fiber, ash, moisture and fat of the supplemented sorghum kisra were also increased, but the content of carbohydrate was decreased as a result of supplementation. The replacement of sorghum flour with different ratios of pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>kernels</b> flour resulted in a concomitant increase in the energy value of the kisra produced. Minerals content significantly (P≤ 0. 05) increased especially K from 17. 07 mg/ 100 g in control kisra to 18. 5, 19. 6 and 20. 4 mg/ 100 g, P from 206. 1 mg/ 100 g in control kisra to 240. 6, 253. 6 and 266. 8 mg/ 100 g and Mg from 9. 6 mg/ 100 g in control kisra to 11. 6, 13. 8 and 15. 5 mg/ 100 g in kisra supplemented with 5 %, 10 % and 15 % pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>kernels</b> flour, respectively. Amino acids content of kisra supplemented with 5 %, 10 % and 15 % pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>kernels</b> flour also increased especially lysine from 24. 9 mg/ 100 g in control kisra to 55. 5 mg/ 100 g, 58. 7 mg/ 100 g and 64. 1 mg/ 100 g protein and thrionine from 38. 9 mg/ 100 g in control kisra to 56. 2 mg/ 100 g, 80. 9 mg/ 100 g and 85. 4 mg/ 100 g protein, respectively.

The AZRL and simple terpenoids (ST) content in the neem <b>seed</b> <b>kernel,</b> the <b>seed</b> shell, the leaf and the leaf stem was determined with conventional extraction method and the newly developed quantification technique. The results showed that the AZRL content in these parts of neem decreases in the order of <b>seed</b> <b>kernel</b> > leaf > seed shell > leaf stem. With the HPLC quantification technique, the content of azadirachtin in the neem <b>seed</b> <b>kernel</b> was determined, and the comparison of the azadirachtin content and the AZRL content suggested that azadirachtin accounts for around 58 % of the total AZRL. Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of AZRL and ST from various parts of neem was also investigated. Various parameters affecting the extraction such as the power and the microwave irradiation time were studied. The comparison of the MAE with two conventional extraction methods, viz., room temperature extraction (RTE) and reflux temperature extraction (RFX) revealed that the property of sample matrix affected the special accelerating effect of the MAE.

MethodsThe preliminary phytochemical screening was performed by the standard methods as described by Harborne. Cold extraction method was employed to extract the bioactive compounds from mango <b>seed</b> <b>kernel.</b> Disc diffusion method was adopted to screen antibacterial activity. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was evaluated by agar dilution method. The crude extracts were partially purified by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and the fractions were analyzed by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) to identify the bioactive compounds. ResultsPhytochemical scrutiny of M. indica indicated the presence of phytochemical constituents such as alkaloids, gums, flavanoids, phenols, saponins, steroids, tannins and xanthoproteins.

30|$|Consumption and {{industrial}} exploitation of mango generate significant waste, mainly {{made of the}} peels and the seed kernel of the fruit, which account for 7 % to 22 % {{of the weight of}} the whole fruit [1]. In Cameroon, a rapid estimation of this waste based on the national mango production, evaluated to 539, 000  t in 2012 [2], showed that nearly 38, 500 to 121, 000  t of mango waste are produced. Environmental, hygienic, and public health problems result in unorganized management of this waste [3, 4]. Valorization of mango <b>seed</b> <b>kernels</b> through production of butter and biofunctional flour are the main solutions technologically proposed, since different studies have shown that mango <b>seed</b> <b>kernels</b> contain various phenolic compounds. Mango seed kernel butter is used in cosmetics for its non-saponifiable matter content and its antioxidant activity potential [5 - 7]. The mango seed kernel flour displays interesting antioxidant and antibacterial properties [8 - 13]. These properties have also been found in mango peels [3]. Valorizing this biowaste as a potential source of non-conventional oil and natural antioxidants represents an opportunity to improve mango producer's income, particularly in regions where poverty is current. In this respect, drying of the <b>seed</b> <b>kernels</b> {{is one of the main}} technological steps both for efficient extraction of the functional components and for inactivation of enzymatic degradation of the raw material. Drying of mango <b>seed</b> <b>kernels</b> before extraction contributes then to stabilize the product and to increase the yield of extraction. Since the temperature and the time of drying may affect the activity and the stability of bioactive compounds, due to chemical and enzymatic degradation, low evaporation, and/or thermal degradation, a badly carried out drying can lead to physicochemical reactions which can lead to losses of the textural and nutritional values [14] and thus bring damage in the quality of the product. Optimizing the drying of <b>seed</b> <b>kernels</b> would then enable to make sure that the product obtained has desired quality.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this study, the oil {{extraction}} process from Australian native beauty leaf seed has been optimised {{in terms of}} seed preparation and cracking, <b>seed</b> <b>kernel</b> treatment, moisture content and {{oil extraction}} methods. Two methods: mechanical oil extraction using an electric powered screw press and chemical oil extraction using n-hexane as an oil solvent have been applied to extract oil from the <b>seed</b> <b>kernel.</b> Both whole and grated kernels {{have been used for}} mechanical oil extraction process. The study indicated that treatment of <b>seed</b> <b>kernel</b> has a significant impact on oil yields for both techniques. It has been observed that kernels prepared to 15 % moisture content provided the highest oil yields for both extraction methods. Mechanical extraction using the screw press could produce oil from the prepared kernels at a low cost. In addition, it has been obtained that oil yields by using grated kernels were relatively higher than the whole kernels. However, oil extraction by using this technique is ineffective due to relatively lower oil yields compared to chemical extraction. On the other hand, chemical extraction was found to be a very effective method for oil extraction because of its consistence performance and high oil yield, but cost of production was relatively higher due to high cost of solvent. The outcomes of this study are expected to serve as the basis on which industrial scale oil extraction can be made from beauty leaf seed...|$|R
