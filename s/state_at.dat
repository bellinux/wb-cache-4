5|$|New Jersey's {{first state}} {{constitution}} was adopted on July 2, 1776. The American Revolutionary War was underway and George Washington {{had recently been}} defeated in New York, putting New Jersey in imminent danger of invasion. With Patriot and Tory factions plotting and battling each other, New Jersey was a <b>state</b> <b>at</b> war and was nearly a <b>state</b> <b>at</b> civil war. Composed in a span of five days and ratified only two days later, during this state of emergency, on July 2, 1776, the New Jersey State Constitution reflects the turbulence and uncertainty of the moment. Its primary objective {{was to provide a}} basic governmental framework that would preempt New Jersey's fall into anarchy. And yet this Constitution served as the charter document for the State's government for the next 68 years.|$|E

Damage is greatest in Brunswick County, where great coastal damage occurs {{due to a}} powerful storm tide. Considered the most destructive hurricane to affect the <b>state</b> <b>at</b> the time, the hurricane causes an estimated damage total of $136million (1954USD, $1.09billion 2008USD).

5|$|Samarium forms {{trivalent}} sulfide, selenide and telluride. Divalent chalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe with cubic rock-salt {{crystal structure}} are also known. They are remarkable by converting from semiconducting to metallic <b>state</b> <b>at</b> room temperature upon application of pressure. Whereas {{the transition is}} continuous and occurs at about 20–30kbar in SmSe and SmTe, it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6.5kbar. This effect results in spectacular color change in SmS from black to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished. The transition does not change lattice symmetry, {{but there is a}} sharp decrease (~15%) in the crystal volume. It shows hysteresis, that is when the pressure is released, SmS returns to the semiconducting <b>state</b> <b>at</b> much lower pressure of about 0.4 kbar.|$|E

The passage of the hurricane affected thousands of houses, leaving roughly 250,000homeless in the <b>state.</b> <b>At</b> least 110people died in the state, with hundreds of thousands of residents and 1,278communities being affected.|$|E

5|$|After {{upsetting}} second-ranked Michigan State, 34–7, Maryland {{climbed to}} an AP Poll ranking of {{eighth in the}} nation and then defeated Georgetown. The following game they met N.C. <b>State</b> <b>at</b> Byrd Stadium for Homecoming weekend. In the first quarter, a Maryland fumble rolled out of the end zone for a safety, and soon after, another fumble set up a touchdown rush by NC State. Maryland advanced inside the N.C. State five-yard line three times but was unable to score. In the third quarter, NC State scored again to expand their lead, 0–16. Maryland scored on a 21-yard pass from Jack Scarbath to Bob Shemonski. With three minutes remaining, Shemonski connected with a pass to Pete Augsburger for another touchdown. A 47-yard drive into Wolfpack territory ended with an interception in the end zone with seconds remaining. The loss effectively ended the Terrapins' hopes for a bowl game bid. The second loss dropped them out of the AP Poll {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|After winning out a close {{competition}} with Jevan Snead, McCoy became the 2006 starting {{quarterback for the}} University of Texas.

He was 12-19 in passing, and ran for 27 yards to help set up a touchdown. In only his second pass as a college quarterback McCoy threw a 60-yard touchdown pass. He was the first Texas freshman quarterback to start and win a season-opening game since Bobby Layne in 1944. The next week, the Longhorns faced #1 Ohio <b>State</b> <b>at</b> home. McCoy went 19-32, 156 yards, one touchdown, and one interception while rushing four times {{for a total of}} eight yards. Ohio State defeated the Longhorns 24–7, ending the Longhorns 21-game winning streak.|$|E
