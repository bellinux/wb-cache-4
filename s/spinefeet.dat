50|$|As noted above, several presumed {{species are}} {{suspected}} to actively interbreed even today; these might warrant merging {{as a single}} species. This applies to the white-spotted <b>spinefoot</b> (S. canaliculatus) and the mottled <b>spinefoot</b> (S. fuscescens), and to the blotched foxface (S. unimaculatus) and the foxface rabbitfish (S. vulpinus). Alternatively they might be very recently evolved species {{that have not yet}} undergone complete lineage sorting, but their biogeography suggests that each group is just color morphs of a single species. On the other hand, the morphologyically diverse Blue-spotted <b>Spinefoot</b> (S. corallinus) might represent more than one species; orange individuals are found at the north of its range, while yellow ones occur to the south, and these two may be completely parapatric. Some species of <b>spinefoot</b> have a very painful sting on each of their barbs, but some are a good eating fish.|$|R

50|$|Rabbitfishes or <b>spinefoots</b> are perciform fishes in {{the family}} Siganidae. The 28 species are in a single genus, Siganus. In some now {{obsolete}} classifications, the species having prominent face stripes - colloquially called foxfaces - are in the genus Lo. Other species, such as the masked <b>spinefoot</b> (S. puellus), show a reduced form of the stripe pattern. Rabbitfishes are native to shallow waters in the Indo-Pacific, but S. luridus and S. rivulatus have become established in the eastern Mediterranean via Lessepsian migration.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to examine the length-weight relationships and condition factors of snapper Lutjanus russellii, ponyfish Aurigequula fasciata and white-spotted <b>spinefoot</b> Siganus canaliculatus harvested from Ulelhee Bay, Banda Aceh City, Indonesia. These species are the predominant fishes caught by traditional beach trawl in Ulelhee Bay, Banda Aceh City, Indonesia. The sampling was conducted for three months from April to June 2015 at one-week interval. A total of 900 fish samples (300 individuals for each species) were measured for the total length and body weight. The length-weight relationships were calculated using Linear Allometric Model (LAM), while the relative weights (Wr) and Fulton’s condition (K) factors were calculated to assess the condition of the fish samples. The results showed that the b value of 3. 04 in snapper indicates isometric growth pattern, while ponyfish and white-spotted <b>spinefoot</b> fish had the b values of 1. 41 and 1. 75, respectively, and these species display an allometric growth pattern. The average Fulton’s condition factor (K) of snapper was 3. 01 for male and 2. 49 for female; female ponyfish has the K value of 2. 92 and 2. 92 for male. In addition, the average K value of whitespotted <b>spinefoot</b> was 2. 61 and 2. 59 for female and male, respectively. The relative weight condition factor ranges from 58. 73 to 166. 09 for snapper, from 70. 55 to 129. 65 for ponyfish, and from 71. 63 to 133. 53 for white-spotted <b>spinefoot.</b> In general, the relative weight condition factors tendedto be 100. It is concluded that snapper has isometric growth pattern, while ponyfish and white-spotted <b>spinefoot</b> display the negative allometric growth pattern. The condition factors are in excellent condition and indicate a balance of prey and predator...|$|R

50|$|The masked <b>spinefoot</b> (Siganus puellus), {{also known}} as {{decorated}} rabbitfish or masked rabbitfish, occurs in shallow, coral-rich areas of clear lagoons and seaward reefs of the Indo-West Pacific region at depths of 10 to 100 feet.|$|R
40|$|Lunar cycle-associated {{physiology}} {{has been}} found {{in a wide variety of}} organisms. Recent study has revealed that mRNA levels of Cryptochrome (Cry), one of the circadian clock genes, were significantly higher on a full moon night than on a new moon night in coral, implying the involvement of a photoreception system in the lunar-synchronized spawning. To better establish the generalities surrounding such a mechanism and explore the underlying molecular mechanism, we focused on the relationship between lunar phase, Cry gene expression, and the spawning behavior in a lunar-synchronized spawner, the goldlined <b>spinefoot</b> (Siganus guttatus), and we identified two kinds of Cry genes in this animal. Their mRNA levels showed lunar cycle-dependent expression in the medial part of the brain (mesencephalon and diencephalon) peaking at the first quarter moon. Since this lunar phase coincided with the reproductive phase of the goldlined <b>spinefoot,</b> Cry gene expression was considered a state variable in the lunar phase recognition system. Based on the expression profiles of SgCrys together with the moonlight’s pattern of timing and duration during its nightly lunar cycle, we have further speculated on a model of lunar phase recognition for reproductive control in the goldlined <b>spinefoot,</b> which integrates both moonlight an...|$|R

40|$|Global {{increase}} in sea temperatures {{has been suggested}} to facilitate the incoming and spread of tropical invaders. The increasing success of these species {{may be related to}} their higher physiological performance compared with indigenous ones. Here, we determined the effect of temperature on the aerobic metabolic scope (MS) of two herbivorous fish species that occupy a similar ecological niche in the Mediterranean Sea: the native salema (Sarpa salpa) and the invasive marbled <b>spinefoot</b> (Siganus rivulatus). Our results demonstrate a large difference in the optimal temperature for aerobic scope between the salema (21. 8 °C) and the marbled <b>spinefoot</b> (29. 1 °C), highlighting the importance of temperature in determining the energy availability and, potentially, the distribution patterns of the two species. A modelling approach based on a present-day projection and a future scenario for oceanographic conditions was used to make predictions about the thermal habitat suitability (THS, an index based on the relationship between MS and temperature) of the two species, both at the basin level (the whole Mediterranean Sea) and at the regional level (the Sicilian Channel, a key area for the inflow of invasive species from the Eastern to the Western Mediterranean Sea). For the present-day projection, our basin-scale model shows higher THS of the marbled <b>spinefoot</b> than the salema in the Eastern compared with the Western Mediterranean Sea. However, by 2050, the THS of the marbled <b>spinefoot</b> is predicted to increase throughout the whole Mediterranean Sea, causing its westward expansion. Nevertheless, the regional-scale model suggests that the future thermal conditions of Western Sicily will remain relatively unsuitable for the invasive species and could act as a barrier for its spread westward. We suggest that metabolic scope {{can be used as a}} tool to evaluate the potential invasiveness of alien species and the resilience to global warming of native species...|$|R

Its dorsal and anal fin spines contain venom that is not life-threatening to humans.|$|R
25|$|Smaller {{parrotfish}} {{are relatively}} defenceless herbivores, poorly defended against predators like barracuda. They {{have evolved to}} find protection by schooling, sometimes with other species like shoaling rabbitfish. <b>Spinefoot</b> rabbitfish are named for their defensive venomous spines, and they are seldom attacked by predators. Spines are a last-ditch defence. It is better to avoid predator detection in the first place, and avoid being thrust into risky spine-to-fang battles. So rabbitfish have also evolved skilful colour changing abilities.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: An {{ecological}} {{assessment of the}} siganid fishery in the Caluangan Lake and Baruyan River in the City of Calapan, Oriental Mindoro, Philippines was conducted from June 2013 to May 2014. Two siganid species were identified in the study area, the mottled <b>spinefoot,</b> Siganus fuscescens (Houttuyn, 1782) and orange spotted <b>spinefoot,</b> Siganus guttatus (Bloch, 1787). The study showed that these species are good source of livelihood for fishermen and their dependents. Dissolved oxygen was found to fall within the permissible standards both during the wet and dry season sampling that gives suitable habitat for the two species of siganid to thrive to. Exceedance was observed in sodium, chlorine, sulphate {{as well as the}} total dissolved solid (TDS) which registered values way above the permissible standard. Socio-economic conditions were also determined to see the level of exploitation the surrounding community wherein the availability of other sources of livelihood prevents the exploitation of siganid and other fishery resources in the study area.
