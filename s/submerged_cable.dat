The first practical application of the science was in the Firth of Forth in August 1915, by the Scottish physicist Alexander Crichton Mitchell, {{with the help of}} the Royal Navy research establishment at HMS Tarlair (Aberdour). Unfortunately his report to the Board of Investigation and Research (BIR) was misunderstood and his findings rejected as of no value. The scientist William Bragg of BIR was pursuing related research in the BIR, but as BIR was independent of Royal Navy control, which the navy resented, he faced significant obstacles, even when he moved to HMS Tarlair. Bragg moved to the BIR experimental station at Harwich, Essex, England. Re-examination of Mitchell's work, at Bragg's suggestion, in 1917 renewed interest in loops, leading to the successful development at Harwich of an operational system by mid-1918. Loops were extensively used by the Allies during World War II to protect harbours against submarine attack.|$|E

Theoretical models show that the actual reconstruction of the near water-bottom sediments, in terms of geometry and resistivity, can be obtained only with the <b>submerged</b> <b>cable,</b> however, the data, unlike that acquired with the floating cable, require a priori information on water resistivity and thickness for the data inversion. Theoretical forward models based on wrong a priori water thickness and resistivity information influence the inverted model in different ways, depending on the under- and over-estimation of water resistivity and thickness, and the resistivity contrast of the water–solid layer; however a water–solid resistivity contrast of less than 2 and within 10 % of error in water resistivity has no effect. Overestimating water resistivity depicts a ground similar to the actual ground in terms of resistivity, more so than the underestimation of water resistivity. Moreover, the data inversion is less influenced by water parameter error in the case of low resistivity contrast in the water–solid layer, than it is for high resistivity contrast.

50|$|Brett {{was the son}} of a cabinetmaker, William Brett of Bristol, and {{was born}} in that city in 1805. Brett is known as the founder of {{submarine}} telegraphy.

After some years spent in perfecting his plans he sought and obtained permission from Louis-Philippe in 1847 to establish telegraphic communication between France and England, but the project was deemed too hazardous for general support. However, he was successful in connecting the two nations briefly by undersea cable in 1850. A more durable cable was laid in 1851, and the construction of numerous other submarine lines followed. Brett always expressed himself confident as to the ultimate union of England and America by means of electricity, but he did not live to see it accomplished.|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of saxitoxin by the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella and the bioaccumulation of neurotoxin in shellfish {{can result in}} people contracting paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) after consuming contaminated shellfish. The Washington State Department of Health (WDOH) routinely tests commercially farmed shellfish for saxitoxin concentrations, however, recreationally harvested shellfish pose a public health risk because a delay in posting warning signs about contamination or closing beaches {{increases the risk of}} exposure to saxitoxin through contaminated shellfish. Many Alexandrium blooms are initiated by cysts, a dormant form of A. catenella that can remain viable in sediments for long periods of time. The purpose of this research is to develop a low cost and easy to build instrument to serve as an early warning system for Alexandrium blooms that monitors benthic conditions as a proxy for the likelihood of a bloom. The in-situ instrument will have multiple nodes of temperature and light sensors along a <b>submerged</b> <b>cable</b> terminating at an above-water data logger. Temperature and light are monitored because benthic temperatures above 12 ° C and adequate light reaching the cysts can trigger cyst germination making them good predictors of Alexandrium bloom likelihood. Because of the simple design of the instrument, citizen scientists can become engaged in the coastal and public health issue of harmful algal blooms along their local beaches. With citizen involvement in monitoring where and when blooms are likely to occur it allows citizens become more aware of PSP and increase public safety surrounding the issue as well as increase scientific awareness of Alexandrium bloom progression in Puget Sound as a result of increased monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The {{nonlinear}} {{dynamic analysis}} of cable and membrane structures {{is presented in}} this study. Attention {{is given to the}} nonlinearities arising from large displacements, from nonlinear stress-strain relationships and from nonconservative loadings. The finite element method is used to model the cables and membranes. Curvilinear geometries of the elements are approximated by using higher-order interpolation polynomials. The relative advantages and disadvantages of adopting elements with various orders of approximating functions are determined by a variety of example problems. Full interaction between the cables and membranes in a structure can be realized by selecting compatible elements. Any desired nonlinear constitutive equation can be specified for the cable and membrane elements. The ability to handle nonconservative loadings is demonstrated by studying the dynamic responses of cables and membranes in a fluid medium. The governing equations of motion of cables and membranes are derived from the three-dimensional equations of finite elasticity. Curvilinear, convected coordinates are used to describe the undeformed and deformed configurations of a body. The total Lagrangian description and the principle of virtual work are used to formulate the equilibrium equations. Specializations to cables and membranes are made by assuming that states of uniaxial stress and plane stress exist in the cables and membranes, respectively. The magnitudes of the displacements and strains are not restricted. Explicit stressstrain relationships are neither assumed nor required. Isoparametric representation is used to formulate curved cable and membrane finite elements. The element matrices are evaluated by numerical integrations. The global dynamic equations of motions are integrated by the Newmark's method. An iteration scheme is used to minimize the residual errors. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the validity and capability of the finite element models and the solution techniques. Higher-order elements are found to be more accurate than linear elements in general, but are computationally more costly. The potential of the finite element method in analyzing the nonlinear dynamic response of <b>submerged</b> <b>cable</b> and membrane structures to wave forces is demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) {{identified}} {{a need for}} a small-scale, portable floating fish collection (PFFC) device to gather additional information on juvenile fish movement in Willamette Valley Project (WVP) reservoirs. This device was intended to provide a cost-effective means of safely obtaining juvenile fish in WVP reservoirs for use in research, monitoring and evaluation efforts as well as to gather information on the behavior of both tagged and run of river fish near and within a small floating surface collector. There are three planned deployments for the device: Lookout Point, Detroit and Cougar Reservoirs. Of these Cougar Reservoir represented the most challenging of the installations due to the large storage capacity provided for flood control and resulting wide range of reservoir water surface elevations. The facility design ultimately provides the USACE a device that can be broken down into components sized to allow safe and normal transport over the state highway system. The attraction flow can be varied from 20 to 140 cfs with hydraulic components that allow tuning of the flow to optimum hydraulic performance for each flow. The anchoring system is designed to accommodate up to a 200 ft variation in reservoir water surface, including rapid fluctuations. Features that provide separation and protection of various sized fish include a grader with adjustable bar spacing, shelter areas and the means to sort fish by way of a crowder and hopper system. Power for operating systems is provided via a <b>submerged</b> <b>cable</b> tied into station power. The cable also contains wiring {{that can be used to}} convey instrumentation and operational readings back to land based computer equipment.
