40|$|Historically, the {{electric}} utility {{industry has been}} {{regarded as one of}} the most open industries in the United States in sharing information but their reputation is being challenged by competitive energy providers, the general public, regulators, and other stakeholders. As the prospect of competition among electricity power providers has increased in recent years, many utilities have been requesting that the data they submit to their utility regulatory commissions remain confidential. Withholding utility information from the public is likely to have serious and significant policy implications with respect to: (1) consumer education, the pursuit of truth, mutual respect among parties, and social cooperation; (2) the creation of a fair market for competitive energy services; (3) the regulatory balance; (4) regional and national assessments of energy-savings opportunities; (5) research and development; and (6) evaluations of utility programs, plans, and policies. In a telephone survey of all public utility commissions (PUCs) that regulate electric and gas utilities in the U.

Since the seminal work of Kraljic in 1983, scholars have proposed a number of models aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of supplier portfolio management.

Such interdependencies are {{the main focus of}} this paper. It has four objectives.

(3) To uncover existing links between buyer-supplier and supplier-supplier relationships. (4) To clarify how supplier relationships within the portfolio may impact the performance of the actors involved. The paper discusses evidence collected in a study of two industrial firms’ supplier portfolios. A main conclusion of the paper is that suppliers ’ interdependences are mainly a by-product of buyer-supplier dyads. Furthermore, the nature and dynamics of those dyads are a strong determinant of the <b>scope</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> of supplier connections and corresponding effects. ...|$|E

Most studies, address questions related to spatial distribution and evolutionary significance of genome duplication (polyploidy), chromosomal variation (aneuploidy) and variation in genome size. The unsurpassed speed and reliability of estimating differences in nuclear DNA content by FCM paves the way for large-scale surveys at the landscape, population, individual and tissue levels. Another attractive feature of FCM is the possibility of reformulating former taxonomic concepts to propose robust classifications based on a detailed understanding of population structure and phenotypic variation of plant groups under investigation.

Furthermore, the European Union’s pan-Europe survey, Eurobarometer, relies on small sample sizes, resulting in different figures to those of national surveys. 1 The following data should therefore be used with caution.

The {{underlying causes of}} such behaviours are not solely based on levels of aggression, but act as a mean of maintaining the subject’s own sense of self-worth, identity, and general functioning. Objective. The aim of the paper is to explore the correlation between affective dependency and reactive/proactive aggression and to evaluate individual differences as predisposing factors for aggressive behaviour and emotional dependency. Methods. The Spouse-Specific Dependency Scale (SSDS) and the Reactive Proactive Questionnaire (RPQ) were administered {{to a sample of}} 3375 subjects. Results. In the whole sample, a positive correlation between emotional dependency and proactive aggression was identified. Differences with regard to sex, age group, and geographical distribution were evidenced for the scores of the different scales. Conclusion.
