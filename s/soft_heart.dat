500|$|From Russia, with Love {{received}} mainly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Julian Symons, in The Times Literary Supplement, considered {{that it was}} Fleming's [...] "tautest, most exciting and most brilliant tale", that the author [...] "brings the thriller in line with modern emotional needs", and that Bond [...] "is the intellectual's Mike Hammer: a killer with a keen eye and a <b>soft</b> <b>heart</b> for a woman". The critic for The Times was less persuaded by the story, suggesting that [...] "the general tautness and brutality of the story leave the reader uneasily hovering between fact and fiction". Although the review compared Fleming in unflattering terms to Peter Cheyney, a crime fiction writer of the 1930s and 1940s, it concluded that From Russia, with Love was [...] "exciting enough of its kind".|$|E
