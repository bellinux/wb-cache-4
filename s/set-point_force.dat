40|$|AbstractThis paper explores AFM-based 3 D {{nanomachining}} process {{assisted by}} ultrasonic vibration. 3 D structures on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) substrates are fabricated by ultrasonic vibration-assisted nanomachining process. Two fabrication approaches for 3 D structures are investigated in this study, which are layer-by-layer nanomachining and one pass nanomachining with the depth controlled by setpoint force. Critical parameters {{in the process}} are identified, including <b>set-point</b> <b>force,</b> overlap rate, amplitude of z vibration and machining speed. By regulating these parameters, stair-like 3 D nanostructures are fabricated by multi-layer machining in Vector mode and Raster scan mode. Using different setpoint force for different feature depth, other nanostructures, such as convex and concave circles, are fabricated in Raster scan mode from grey-scale image. Under each mode, 3 D nanostructure over microscale area can be fabricated {{in just a few}} minutes with the assistance of high frequency in-plane circular xy-vibration and ultrasonic tip-sample z-vibration...|$|E
40|$|Force {{control is}} crucial for {{successful}} execution {{of a number of}} practical tasks. Parallel force/position control is an attractive approach for robot force regulation, although several force control strategies, such as stiffness control, impedance control, and hybrid force/position control, have been developed. Unfortunately, the existing theoretic works on parallel force/position control scheme deal only with linear mechanical characteristics and planar constraints (environment), and in addition require exact robot kinematics. Under the condition of uncertain robot kinematics (or Jacobian matrix), this paper develops parallel force/position controllers without gravity compensation and desired force feedforward; stability of the resulting system is rigorously analyzed in the presence of nonlinear mechanical characteristics of environment and nonplanar surface constraints instead of linear mechanical characteristics and planar constraints addressed in the existing work. We show that asymptotic stability of <b>set-point</b> <b>force</b> regulation is guaranteed when some assumptions are satisfied. In some sense, this result reveals some robustness of parallel force/position control scheme to uncertain environment including geometry and mechanical characteristics. In the case of imperfect force planning, the resulting closed-loop system has constant stead solution instead of an equilibrium trajectory if force-regulation solvability assumption is satisfied. Lastly, with comparisons to hybrid force/position control scheme, numerical simulation demonstrates the effectiveness and performance of the resulting closed-loop system...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{hydraulic}} systems in industrial applications has become widespread {{due to their}} advantages in efficiency. In recent years, hybrid actuation systems, which combine electric and hydraulic technology into a compact unit, have been adapted {{to a wide variety}} of force, speed and torque requirements. A hybrid actuation system resolves energy consumption and noise problems characteristic of conventional {{hydraulic systems}}. A new, low-cost hybrid actuator using a DC motor is considered to be a novel linear actuator with various applications such as robotics, automation, plastic injection-molding, and metal forming technology. However, this efficiency gain is often accompanied by a degradation of system stability and control problems. In this paper, to satisfy robust performance requirements, tracking performance specifications, and disturbance attenuation requirements, the design of a robust force controller for a new hybrid actuator using Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT) is presented. A family of plant models is obtained from measuring frequency responses of the system in the presence of significant uncertainty. Experimental results show that the hybrid actuator can achieve highly robust force tracking even when environmental stiffness <b>set-point</b> <b>force</b> varies. In addition, it is understood that the new system reduces energy use, even though its response is similar to that of a valve-controlled system...|$|E
