40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} focused on local scour {{downstream}} of adverse stilling basins where a <b>submerged</b> <b>wall</b> jet issued from a sluice gate. Experiments were conducted {{in a wide range}} of Froude numbers, grain sizes, tailwater depths, and stilling basin slopes. The results showed that the scour profiles at any bed slope follow shape similarity. However, the longitude evolution of scour profiles and the volume of eroded materials were increasing in accordance with slope of basin. A polynomial equation was derived to define the non-dimensional profiles under different slopes. The time evolution of scour hole dimensions and the equilibrium state were defined. It was found that under a specific condition of sediment grain size, approaching Froude number, the length and slope of adverse basin, the scour depth at the downstream of adverse basin, initially increases with tailwater depth, and after reaching its maximum value decreases to a constant value. It was also observed that the maximum depth of scour hole was decreased as the length and slope of stilling basin increased, whereas the longitudinal dimensions of the hole were increased. It was found that the maximum depth of scour hole occurs at the vicinity of side walls with slight decrease in the centerline. Finally, a power equation was expressed to fully define the dimensions of scour hole, time scale and geometry of sluice gate...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of {{interface}} wave scattering by bottom undulations {{in the presence of}} a thin submerged vertical wall with a gap is investigated. The thin vertical wall with a gap is submerged in a lower fluid of finite depth with bottom undulations and the upper fluid is of infinite height separated by a common interface. In the method of solution, we use a simplified perturbation analysis and suitable applications of Green’s integral theorem in the two fluid regions produce first-order reflection and transmission coefficients in terms of integrals involving the shape function describing the bottom undulations and solution of the scattering problem involving a submerged vertical wall present in the lower fluid of uniform finite depth. For sinusoidal bottom undulations, the first-order transmission coefficient vanishes identically. The corresponding first-order reflection coefficient is computed numerically by solving the zero-order reflection coefficient and a suitable application of multi-term Galerkin approximations. The numerical results of the zero-order and first-order reflection coefficients are depicted graphically against the wave number in a number of figures. An oscillatory nature is observed of first-order reflection coefficient due to multiple interactions of the incident wave with bottom undulations, the edges of the <b>submerged</b> <b>wall</b> and the interface. The first-order reflection coefficient has a peak value for some particular value of the ratio of the incident wavelength and the bottom wavelength. The presence of the upper fluid has some significant effect on the reflection coefficients...|$|E

40|$|The {{architectural}} drawing brings together {{two aspects of}} architecture’s inescapable relationship with the human body: knowledge and desire. When Adolf Loos designed the never built Josephine Baker House (1928), his drawings mobilized and transmitted knowledge {{of the human body}} in general. At the same time, Loos deployed architectural means to express desire for the dancer’s body. The sections and plans suggest that the Viennese architect imagined Baker swimming in a pool whose <b>submerged</b> <b>walls</b> include large windows looking into the watery stage, enveloping the dancer’s body while putting it on display for guests. Considered more generally, the {{architectural drawing}} always contains these two bodily moments, insofar as it describes proposals that give form to the lived world. This dynamic couple in the drawing corresponds to the difference between touching the body and grasping it; between an architect pursuing the desire to affect others through their senses and an architectural discipline extending its knowledge of human existence. This article considers relevant aspects in the writings of Robin Evans, Michel Foucault, Michel de Certeau, William T. Mitchell, and Jean-Luc Nancy to develop a theoretical basis for understanding the tensions and alliances at play when architecture draws the body between knowledge and desire. </p...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, scour of {{cohesive}} soils by <b>submerged</b> circular turbulent <b>wall</b> jets is investigated. Two sets of experimental {{data obtained by}} Abt (1980) and Mazurek (unpublished) are analyzed. The first set of data {{is a series of}} twelve experiments of 1000 minutes duration, where the scour in one cohesive material downstream of a culvert outlet was observed, with the tailwater maintained at a certain height above the culvert invert. The other set of data is an unpublished laboratory study of the scour of clays by a <b>submerged</b> circular <b>wall</b> jet produced in two {{cohesive soils}} by flow through a nozzle with a diameter of 4. 9, 5. 97 or 12. 18 mm. Twenty-three experiments were performed to examine the shape and size of the scour holes produced in these materials in the asymptotic state. In the present study, dimensionless scour hole profiles are developed to give the general shape of the scour holes produced by these jets in cohesive material. It is seen the scour holes have the same dimensionless shape, and this shape is consistent through the scouring process. Using dimensional analysis, a model has been developed to predict the characteristic dimensions of the scour hole, such as the maximum scour depth, the length of the scour hole, and the maximum width. These dimensions are found to correlate well with a dimensionless excess shear stress term found from dimensional analysis. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{nowadays}} {{as well as in the}} past the vast majority of human habitation and activities are mainly concentrated in littoral areas. Thus the increased attention to coastal zone management contributed to the development and implementation of shallow-water mapping approaches for capturing current environmental conditions. During the last decade, geophysical imaging techniques like electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) have been used in mapping onshore buried antiquities in a non-destructive manner, contributing to cultural heritage management. Despite its increased implementation in mapping on-shore buried archaeological remains, ERT has minimal to non-existent employment for the understanding of the past dynamics in littoral and shallow off-shore marine environments. This work presents the results of an extensive ERT survey in investigating part of the Hellenistic to Byzantine submerged archaeological site of Olous, located on the north-eastern coast of Crete, Greece. A marine area of 7100 m 2 was covered with 178 densely spaced ERT lines having a cumulative length of 8. 3 km. A combination of submerged static and moving survey modes were used to document potential buried and submerged structures. The acquired data from the marine environment were processed with two-dimensional and three-dimensional inversion algorithms. A real time kinematic global navigation satellite system was used to map the visible <b>submerged</b> <b>walls</b> and compile the bathymetry model of the bay. The adaptation of ERT in reconstructing the underwater archaeological remains in a shallow marine environment presented specific methodological and processing challenges. The in situ experience from the archaeological site of Olous showed that ERT provided a robust method for mapping the submerged archaeological structures related to the ancient built environment (walls, buildings, roads), signifying at the same time the vertical stratigraphy of the submerged sediments. The inherent limitation of employing ERT in a conductive environment is counterbalanced by the incorporation of precise knowledge for the conductivity and bathymetry of the saline water in the modelling and inversion procedure. Although the methodology definitely needs further refinement, the overall outcomes of this work underline the potential of ERT imaging being integrated into wider shallow marine projects for the mapping of archaeological sites in similar environmental regimes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Loss {{of lives}} and huge damages due to tsunamis and {{flooding}} {{can be prevented}} by {{the principle of the}} stable vertical <b>wall</b> <b>submerged</b> at minimum 20 m below sea level. Tsunami impulse waves are reflected and the build up of catastrophic tsunami waves near the coast is suppressed. A novel technology applies steel fences with horizontal anchors and stabilizes them by inserting rocks from above. A double-pontoon method allows efficient erecting such barriers starting from the coast. Hanging surge stoppers protect the barrier top against highest storm waves. The barriers form large seawater reservoirs to be used for tidal energy (by turbines fixed inside the barrier), for energy storage by pumps between reservoirs, and for large-scale fish farming, or the reservoirs are filled up for land reclamation. This architecture allows to build stable dikes, to prevent erosion of coasts and artificial islands, and to protect bridge pillars and offshore platforms.

Periphyton may be an alternative or a complement for supplemental feed in fingerling production. Growth and production of hybrid red tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus x Oreochromis niloticus) were evaluated in twelve 5 x 5 x 1 -m(3) concrete mud-bottomed tanks with bamboo poles for periphyton production. <b>Submerged</b> tank <b>wall</b> surface was 16 m(2). There were three densities of 1. 5 -m bamboo poles: 0, 98 and 196 poles/ 25 m(2), resulting in 0, 18. 5 and 37 m(2) of additional pole surface per tank. Tanks were stocked with red tilapia try (average weight 1. 2 g) at 25 fish tank(- 1). At each substrate density, half of the tanks were fed with a fishmeal-based 35 % protein diet at 5 % body weight day(- 1). Fish were harvested after 75 days. During the experiment, periphyton density on the substrates (ash-free dry matter [AFDM], ash and chlorophyll a) and water quality were monitored regularly. Water quality was favourable for fish growth and there were only minor differences between the treatments. Periphyton biomass density on the substrates initially increased and was subsequently reduced during the experiment due to fish gazing. Final mean (+/-S. E.) gross fish yields (g/ 25 m(2)) without substrates were 850. 3 g (+/- 73. 7) without and 1225. 7 (+/- 193. 7) with feeding. With 98 poles tank(- 1), gross yields increased to 1803. 8 (+/- 79. 1) without and 2141. 8 (+/- 221. 7) with feeding. With 196 poles tank(- 1), yields were not or only marginally higher. Although more experiments are needed to optimize periphyton density in relation to fish size and stocking density, {{the results show that}} periphyton can replace or complement supplemental feeding in tilapia fingerling culture.

40|$|According to the {{computational}} {{results of}} wave height distribution near the step-type reef by adopting the mild-slope equation with the conservation law of energy flux across the bathymetric discontinuity, reflection and transmission coefficients give suitable values for long period waves, but the reflection coefficient is underestimated for moderately shorter period waves. The reason {{comes from the}} fact that wave reflection from vertical wall on the top of the reef is not counted in the calculation above, that is, the mild-slope equation is derived on the assumption of weak horizontal variation of water depth, but the <b>submerged</b> vertical <b>wall</b> is a sudden change in water depth and is not considered in the equation. If we intend to take account of the wave reflection accurately, the three dimensional finite element method and/or the boundary element method are available. However, it is hopeful to deal with the problem above in a two-dimensional one. Therefore, the present paper, firstly, offers an approximate reflective boundary condition on the top of the reef and the corresponding functional, for application to the finite element method based on the mild-slope equation. The boundary condition is verified by predicting wave height around a submerged breakwater. The most important property of the boundary condition is independence on the direction of incident waves, that is, whether waves incident from deeper to shallower regions or shallower to deeper ones. Secondly, the present paper discusses wave breaking. Wave breaking have been taken into consideration in calculation of wave field based on the mild-slope equation, but the dissipation coefficient after breaking is available only for sloping beach and then any formulae suitable for numerical simulation in reef coasts have not been presented. A breaking criterion and the dissipation coefficient on the step-type reef are proposed based on the results of hydraulic experiments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{results from}} experiments performed to help understand {{certain aspects of}} the MC- 1 engine prestart thermal conditioning procedure. The procedure was constrained {{by the fact that the}} engine must chill long enough to get quality LOX at the LOX pump inlet but must be short enough to prevent freezing of RP- 1 in the fuel pump. A chill test of an MC- 1 LOX impeller was performed in LN 2 to obtain data on film boiling, transition boiling and impeller temperature histories. The transition boiling data was important to the chill time so a subsequent experiment was performed chilling simple steel plates in LOX to obtain similar data for LOX. To address the fuel freezing concern, two experiments were performed. First, fuel was frozen in a tray and its physical characteristics were observed and temperatures of the fuel were measured. The result was physical characteristics as a function of temperature.

40|$|Abstract: Sediment {{management}} {{with the}} help of water jets in combined-sewer-overflow (CSOs) reservoirs in the Chicago area has motivated this work. Erosion caused by single and multiple <b>submerged</b> circular turbulent <b>wall</b> jets on a granular (non cohesive) sediment bed of finite thickness laying on a fixed boundary was studied {{with the help}} of laboratory experiments. Plane turbulent wall jets were also tested on sewer sediment in order to determine its critical shear stress. Though not strongly cohesive this sewer sediment presented some floculation. Regarding circular jets, different combinations of jet diameter, jet separation, and ratio between sediment thickness and jet diameter were tested. For granular sediments results show a relation between dimensionless parameters characterizing the steady state bed profile and the densimetric particle Froude number Fo given by the velocity at the nozzle, and the effective diameter and submerged specific density of the sediment. Sewer sediment is better characterized by the critical shear stress beyond which transport occurs. For both kinds of sediment, evolution of scour with time confirms previous studies where the erosion was found to initially grow with the logarithm of time up to a certain reference time. This time, made dimensionless with a time scale tc involving the volume of sediment scoured and the rate of erosion, was also related to the densimetric Froude number in the studies involving granular (non cohesive) sediment...|$|R
40|$|Crater Lake was {{surveyed}} {{nearly to}} its shoreline by high-resolution multibeam echo sounding {{in order to}} define its geologic history and provide an accurate base map for research and monitoring surveys. The bathymetry and acoustic backscatter reveal the character of landforms and lead to a chronology for the concurrent filling {{of the lake and}} volcanism within the ca. 7700 calibrated yr B. P. caldera. The andesitic Wizard Island and central-platform volcanoes are composed of sequences of lava deltas that record former lake levels and demonstrate simultaneous activity at the two vents. Wizard Island eruptions ceased when the lake was ∼ 80 m lower than at present. Lava streams from prominent channels {{on the surface of the}} central platform descended to feed extensive subaqueous flow fields on the caldera floor. The Wizard Island and central-platform volcanoes, andesitic Merriam Cone, and a newly discovered probable lava flow on the eastern floor of the lake apparently date from within a few hundred years of caldera collapse, whereas a small rhyodacite dome was emplaced on the flank of Wizard Island at ca. 4800 cal. yr B. P. Bedrock outcrops on the <b>submerged</b> caldera <b>walls</b> are shown in detail and, in some cases, can be correlated with exposed geologic units of Mount Mazama. Fragmental debris making up the walls elsewhere consists of narrow talus cones forming a dendritic pattern that leads to fewer, wider ridges downslope. Hummocky topography and scattered blocks up to ∼ 280 m long below many of the embayments in the caldera wall mark debris-avalanche deposits that probably formed in single events and commonly are affected by secondary failures. The flat-floored, deep basins contain relatively fine-grained sediment transported from the debris aprons by sheet-flow turbidity currents. Crater Lake apparently filled rapidly (ca. 400 – 750 yr) until reaching a permeable layer above glaciated lava identified by the new survey in the northeast caldera wall at ∼ 1845 m elevation. Thereafter, a gradual, climatically modulated rise in lake level to the present 1883 m produced a series of beaches culminating in a modern wave-cut platform, commonly ∼ 40 m wide, where suitable material is present. The new survey reveals landforms that result from intermediate-composition volcanism in rising water, delineates mass wasting and sediment transport into a restricted basin, and yields a more accurate postcaldera history leading to improved assessment of volcanic hazards...|$|R
40|$|As {{excess water}} is {{discharged}} {{from a high}} dam, low frequency noise (air pulsation lower than 10 Hz, LFN) is generated and propagated in the surrounding areas, causing environmental hazards such as the vibration of windows and doors and the discomfort of local residents. To study the generation mechanisms and key influencing factors of LFN induced by flood discharge and energy dissipation from a high dam with a ski-jump type spillway, detailed prototype observations and analyses of LFN are carried out. The discharge flow field is simulated and analyzed using a gas-liquid turbulent flow model. The acoustic response characteristics of the air cavity, which is formed between the discharge nappe and dam body, are analyzed using an acoustic numerical model. The multi-sources generation mechanisms are first proposed basing on the prototype observation results, vortex sound model, turbulent flow model and acoustic numerical model. Two kinds of sources of LFN are studied. One comes from the energy dissipation of submerged jets in the plunge pool, the other comes from nappe-cavity coupled vibration. The results of the analyses reveal that the submerged jets in the plunge pool only contribute to an on-site LFN energy of 0 – 1. 0 Hz, and the strong shear layers around the high-velocity <b>submerged</b> jets and <b>wall</b> jet development areas are the main acoustic source regions of LFN in the plunge pool. In addition, the nappe-cavity coupled vibration, which is induced when the discharge nappe vibrates with close frequency to the model frequency of the cavity, can induce on-site LFN energy with wider frequency spectrum energy within 0 – 4. 0 Hz. By contrast, the contribution degrees to LFN energy from two acoustic sources are almost same, while the contribution degree from nappe-cavity coupled vibration is slightly higher...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the Socio-Economic system sets the engineering problems in a broader perspective. It answers why a technical problem should be solved and in what kind of socio- economic environment. An insight in recent history shows that Angoche once was an important port and town for the Nampula province. Agro-Industry was the main economic driver, producing cashew, sisal hemp, cotton, sugar and prawns. Civil strife, tragic World Bank policy {{and the development of}} the natural deep port of Nacala brought down the town and District of Angoche. A deteriorated road and port put it on an 'infrastructural island', which holds back all economic activity, essential to solve everyday problems as immense unemployment, public health and education. AgroIndustry (namely cashew, cassava and fresh fish/prawns), tourism and exploitation of heavy sands (containing titanium) are defined as possible new economic drivers. All three can profit from an operational industrial port that opens a gateway to the international port if Nacala. The District Administration is chosen as the problem owner since it is responsible for the infrastructure in the District and its jurisdiction overlaps more or less the future possible hinterland of the port. Due to the Administration's budget, private investment is necessary to improve feasibility. An actor and network analysis reveals that higher-level government is focussed on further development of Nacala (infrastructure) and Ilha de Mos:ambique (tourism). Getting them involved to formulate a consistent policy for Angoche in all relevant fields might be the biggest challenge. Three scenarios, using the three opportunities for the region, show that serious port development is only desirable when a large private investor can function as a driver for the whole region. In the two other scenarios focussing {{on the development of the}} road to Nampula seems more useful. The North of Mozambique, and Angoche in particular, have an interesting natural environment. The tropical climate and the influence of the Indian ocean provide for an ecological system with a great biodiversity. Many people in Angoche work in the fishing industry and profit from the protection of the ecological system and a working port with a good connection to the open sea. In this reseach we have tried to solve the problem concerning navigability of the entrance of the channel, which leads to Porto de Angoche. In the parapgraphs one to four, discriptions of North East Africa, the coastal region of Angoche, the estuary and its morphological system in particular give a clear image of the field of research. We are dealing with an estuary with a tide dominated (low) outer delta and a short tidal basin, vegitated by many mangrove forests. After analyzing the flow area we come to possible interventions which could provide a better entry to the port. On the basis the Multi Criteria Analyses, costs and the policy of the District of Angoche, these interventions are narrowed down to three best, most suitable solutions, which are: guiding of the ebbstream in combination of decrease of sediment in suspension (route II), <b>submerged</b> water <b>wall</b> (route I) and dredging. Because there are still a lot of uncertainties concerning the effects of the interventions, it is recommended to do more research when actual aplication is considered.

40|$|A {{challenge}} {{in the study of}} water waves is that the motion can exhibit qualitative differences at different scales such as deep water versus shallow water, long wavelength versus short wavelength, etc [...] That leads to a restriction in the applicability of the existing wave models. This dissertation concerns the development of an accurate and efficient model that can simulate wave propagation in any range of wave lengths, in any water depth and moreover can deal with various inhomogeneous problems such as bathymetry and walls, leading to wave structure interactions. Based on a variational principle of water waves, the dynamic equations are of Hamiltonian form for wave elevation and surface potential with non-local operators applied to the canonical surface variables. Since the kinetic energy cannot be expressed explicitly in the basic variables an approximation is required. The approximate Hamilton equations are expressed in pseudo-differential operators (PDO) applied to the surface variables. The PDO has a physical interpretation related to the phase velocity. The phase velocity as function of wave length is specified by a dispersion relation. A spatial-spectral implementation with the global PDO or a generalization with global Fourier integral operators (FIO) can retain the exact dispersion property of the model. To deal with practical applications, the model with localization methods in the FIO can deal with localized effects such as breaking waves, partially or fully reflective <b>walls,</b> <b>submerged</b> bars, run-up on shores, etc. The inclusion of a fixed-structure in the spatial-spectral setting is a challenging task. The method as presented here perhaps serves as a first contribution in this topic. Performance of the model is shown by comparing the simulation result with measurement data of various long crested cases of breaking and non-breaking waves. The model has been extensively tested against at least 50 measurement data. Moreover, 30 measurement data of wave breaking experiments were designed by the accurate wave model. The models and methods presented in this dissertation have been packaged as software under the name HAWASSI-AB; here HAWASSI stands for Hamiltonian Wave-Ship-Structure Interaction, while AB stands for Analytic Boussinesq.
