5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth.

5|$|According to MCC {{guidelines}} for umpires, factors {{to consider when}} giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling and whether the ball was swinging through the air. He must also account for {{the height of the}} ball at impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing; from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is easier to make a decision when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman.|$|E

Many believe that the Port of Miami Tunnel Project will be likely to have similar cost overruns, even though the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) promised that the project would finish on time and without overruns. They also state that truck traffic is not a problem in Downtown, and that since 1991 car and truck traffic had reduced significantly.|$|E

This scene, as with all scenes that contain references to Star Wars or its characters, was sent to Lucasfilm for approval, in order to protect copyright.

5|$|By {{the early}} 940s Constantine {{was an old}} man, perhaps more than 70 years of age. The kingdom of Alba was too new to {{be said to have}} a {{customary}} rule of succession, but Pictish and Irish precedents favoured an adult successor descended from Kenneth MacAlpin. Constantine's surviving son Indulf, probably baptised in 927, would have been too young to be a serious candidate for the kingship in the early 940s, and the obvious heir was Constantine's nephew, MalcolmI. As Malcolm was born no later than 901, by the 940s he was no longer a young man, and may have been impatient. Willingly or not—the 11th-century Prophecy of Berchán, a verse history {{in the form of a}} supposed prophecy, <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not a voluntary decision—Constantine abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to Malcolm.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} century BC {{additional}} lines of bank and ditch were constructed {{turning it into a}} multivallate hillfort which is now known as the castle. There is evidence that the fort was violently taken in around AD43 and that the defences were further slighted later in the 1st century after the construction of a Roman army barracks on the hilltop. Excavations of the southwest gate in 1968 and 1969 revealed evidence for one or more severe violent episodes, associated with weaponry and destruction by fire. Whereas the excavator, Leslie Alcock, believed this to have been dated to around AD70, Richard Tabor argues for a date associated with the initial invasion, either AD43 or 44. Michael Havinden <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was the site of vigorous resistance by the Durotriges and Dobunni to the second Augusta Legion under the command of Vespasian.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Ernst Zermelo used chess as a {{basis for}} his theory of game strategies, which is {{considered}} as one of the predecessors of game theory. Zermelo's theorem <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is possible to solve chess, i.e. to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game (either white can force a win, or black can force a win, or both sides can force at least a draw). However, according to Claude Shannon, there are 1043 legal positions in chess, so it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology.|$|E

5|$|Several Muslim {{countries}} {{along the}} south coast of the Mediterranean Sea used a red flag similar to {{the flag of the}} Ottoman Empire. After the destruction of the Tunisian naval division at the Battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827, the sovereign Husainid Dynasty leader Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud decided to create a flag to use for the fleet of Tunisia, to distinguish it from other fleets. There are some discrepancies over the date of the flag's adoption, as the government <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was adopted in 1831, while other sources like Siobhan Ryan's Ultimate Pocket Flags of the World claim that it was adopted in 1835.|$|E
5|$|The Book of the Dead first {{developed}} in Thebes toward {{the beginning of}} the Second Intermediate Period, around 1700 BCE.

Some of the spells introduced at this time claim an older provenance; for instance the rubric to spell 30B <b>states</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was discovered by the Prince Hordjedef in the reign of King Menkaure, many hundreds of years before it is attested in the archaeological record.|$|E
