5|$|In recent times, local bodies {{such as the}} {{municipality}} of Castellar del Riu or Berga or the local branch of the Catalan National Assembly, have adopted the practice of presenting a young three-branched pine tree or <b>sapling</b> {{claimed to be a}} descendant of Pi de les Tres Branques to other bodies, as symbols of solidarity. Early examples include presentations to the Castle of Gallifa in 1986, and the Castle of St. Ferran in Berga in 1992 (along with a <b>sapling</b> of the Tree of Guernica). The practice gained momentum following the February 2014 presentation of a young tree to the town of Folgueroles, to commemorate Jacint Verdaguer who was born there; that tree has since been vandalised. Subsequent 2014 recipients have included Andorra la Vella, Sant Hipòlit de Voltregà, and Saldes. The Forest Museum in Sant Celoni also claims to have five descendants of Pi de les Tres Branques in its grounds.|$|E

5|$|Trees {{are either}} evergreen, having foliage that {{persists}} and remains green throughout the year, or deciduous, shedding their leaves {{at the end}} of the growing season and then having a dormant period without foliage. Most conifers are evergreens but larches (Larix and Pseudolarix) are deciduous, dropping their needles each autumn, and some species of cypress (Glyptostrobus, Metasequoia and Taxodium) shed small leafy shoots annually in a process known as cladoptosis. The crown is a name for the spreading top of a tree including the branches and leaves, while the uppermost layer in a forest, formed by the crowns of the trees, is known as the canopy. A <b>sapling</b> is a young tree.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examined}} Norway spruce (Picea abies) <b>saplings</b> morphological and biomass sensitivity to ozone fumigation using closed indoor chambers of controlled environment. 4 -year-old potted <b>saplings</b> {{were exposed to}} three different ozone concentrations: 80 (micro) g/m 3, 160 (micro) g/m 3, and 240 (micro) g/m 3 (7 h/day, 5 days/week). Half of the <b>saplings</b> were harvested after the exposure, and {{the second half of}} the <b>saplings</b> were left in the pots in open field until next autumn. The reaction of the <b>saplings</b> of different timing of bud burst was also investigated. The terminal shoot length and the total current year shoot length of Norway spruce <b>saplings</b> after one month of ozone fumigation were significantly (p < 0. 05) suppressed in all the treatments comparing to the control <b>saplings.</b> The needles of <b>saplings</b> fumigated with ozone were smaller than the needles of control <b>saplings.</b> No significant changes of the biomass of different fractions of Norway spruce <b>saplings</b> were determined right after the fumigation, as well as, in 14 month after the cessation of the fumigation. Norway spruce <b>saplings</b> of early and late timing of bud burst reacted differently to ozone fumigation during the active growth period. The formation of new needles and shoots of the <b>saplings</b> of late bud burst stage was more suppressed comparing to the <b>saplings</b> of the early bud burst stage. The results suggest that the generatively younger organs during their formation are more susceptible to ozone stress. The differences of the needle age between ozone affected and control <b>saplings</b> decreased in one year after the end of fumigation keeping affected Norway spruce <b>saplings</b> in the open field and thus indicating the start of the recovery process...|$|R
40|$|Mast. <b>saplings</b> {{growing in}} sun and shade in a snowy subalpine parkland in central Japan were {{assessed}} to infer how <b>saplings</b> acclimate to suppression by larger individuals in a conifer clump and to extremely snowy conditions. Sun and shade sap-lings produced structurally different current-year shoots, and allocated biomass to needles and stem differently. Compared with sun <b>saplings,</b> shoots of shade <b>saplings</b> had lower needle mass per unit shoot size, which indicates less dense needle packing {{and more effective}} use of the limited available light by avoiding mutual shading among needles. Biomass allocation within lateral branches also differed between sun and shade <b>saplings.</b> Compared with sun <b>saplings,</b> needle mass was a smaller proportion of total branch mass in shade <b>saplings</b> al-though shade <b>saplings</b> retained needles for longer, thereby compensating, in part, for their lower annual production of needles. Thus shade <b>saplings</b> incur a high mechanical cost to support their low-light acclimated, conspicuously flattened crowns in this snowy habitat. Suppressed <b>saplings</b> are an im-portant component of the persistent conifer clumps in snowy subalpine parklands. The observed structural characteristics of A. mariesii <b>saplings,</b> which ensure high shade- and snow-toler-ance, contribute to {{the dominance of the}} species in snowy subalpine regions in Honshu, Japan...|$|R
5|$|Four dynasties {{have ruled}} the kingdom from its {{founding}} to its ending. The rulers from Vijaya to Subharaja (60–67) are generally considered as the Vijayan dynasty.

5|$|Since {{the early}} 20thcentury, the Serbian badnjak {{tradition}} {{has also been}} celebrated more publicly. Before World War I, soldiers of the Kingdom of Serbia developed the custom of laying a badnjak on a fire in their barracks. In the succeeding Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the military badnjak ceremony was further elaborated and standardized in army service regulations, but the tradition ended at the outbreak of World War II. Since the early 1990s, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve in which the badnjak plays a central role. Parishioners festively cut the <b>sapling</b> {{to be used as}} the badnjak and take it to their church, where it is consecrated by a priest before it is ceremonially placed on a fire built in the churchyard.|$|E
5|$|Yugoslavia's socialist {{government}} suppressed or discouraged public religious celebrations {{until the}} early 1990s. Since then, the Serbian Orthodox Church has, together with local communities, organized public celebrations on Christmas Eve. There are typically three elements to such celebrations: the preparation, the ritual, and the festivity. The preparation consists of cutting down the oak <b>sapling</b> {{to be used as}} the badnjak, taking it to the church yard, and preparing drink and food for the assembled parishioners. The ritual includes Vespers, placing the badnjak on the open fire built in the church yard, blessing or consecrating the badnjak, and an appropriate program with songs and recitals. In some parishes they build the fire on which to burn the badnjak not in the church yard but at some other suitable location in their town or village. The festivity consists of gathering around the fire and socializing. Each particular celebration has its own specific traits however, reflecting the traditions of the local community.|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{survival}} and regrowth of naturally-occurring blue oak <b>saplings</b> burned in a September 1996 arson fire in Vacaville, California. The <b>saplings</b> (pre-fire height 33 - 353 cm) were burned in a rapid, low-moderate intensity fire. Of 67 blue oak <b>saplings</b> surveyed, 4 failed to resprout {{after the fire}} and 2 more died within the following 5 years (9 percent mortality overall); all mortality was among <b>saplings</b> less than 100 cm tall. <b>Saplings</b> which were completely topkilled (51 / 67) were significantly smaller on average than those which were only partially topkilled (12 / 67). <b>Saplings</b> taller than 201 cm or with a stem diameter greater than 5. 6 cm at 30 cm height were only partially topkilled. Only 20 percent of the completely topkilled <b>saplings</b> had regained both their post-fire height and diameter by 5 years after the fire. Height growth of new shoots from completely topkilled <b>saplings</b> was highest {{in the first year}} after the fire, but declined in succeeding years. High levels of vole damage in resprouted topkilled <b>saplings</b> has adversely affected growth and shoot survival.

Of all the shrines in the complex, it is the largest and the first that all pilgrims come to visit. Although it does not have a representation of the deity, kept in an adjoining room is a statue of Shiva also known amongst Sinhalese as Karanduva. Within it there is a clay arm chair known as Kalana Mandima that supposedly belonged to Kalyanagiri Swamy. It is covered by a leopard’s skin and on it has all the ceremonial instruments. To the left of the main shrine lies a smaller shrine dedicated to Hindu god Ganesha who is known as Ganapatidevio amongst Sinhalese. Tamils refer to him as the Manica Pillaiyar as well. It too is a small rectangular building without any decoration. To the left of Ganesha shrine stands the Vishnu Devale the shrine dedicated to Vishnu within which there is also a Buddha image.

5|$|In {{the field}} of {{statistics}} and applied probability, John Graunt published Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality also in 1662, initiating the discipline of demography. This work, among other things, gave a statistical estimate {{of the population of}} London, produced the first life table, gave probabilities of survival of different age groups, examined the different causes of death, noting that the annual rate of suicide and accident is constant, and commented on the level and stability of sex ratio. The usefulness and interpretation of Graunt's tables were discussed in a series of correspondences by brothers Ludwig and Christiaan Huygens in 1667, where they realized the difference between mean and median estimates and Christian even interpolated Graunt's life table by a smooth curve, creating the first continuous probability distribution; but their correspondences were not published. Later, Johan de Witt, the then prime minister of the Dutch Republic, published similar material in his 1671 work Waerdye van Lyf-Renten (A Treatise on Life Annuities), which used statistical concepts to determine life expectancy for practical political purposes; a demonstration of the fact that this <b>sapling</b> branch of mathematics had significant pragmatic applications. De Witt's work was not widely distributed beyond the Dutch Republic, perhaps due to his fall from power and execution by mob in 1672. Apart from the practical contributions of these two work, they also exposed a fundamental idea that probability can be assigned to events that do not have inherent physical symmetry, such as the chances of dying at certain age, unlike say the rolling of a dice or flipping of a coin, simply by counting the frequency of occurrence. Thus probability could be more than mere combinatorics.|$|E

Upon Graduation, each student receives an oak <b>sapling,</b> which is supposed to symbolize their growth at the university as well as the growth in their own lives. The use of the acorn and oak <b>sapling</b> is significant because Elon was named after the Hebrew word for “oak” because of the grove of oak trees it was founded on.

40|$|The {{effect of}} bird {{predation}} on canopy arthropods inhabiting Marri (Eucalyptus calophylla) <b>saplings</b> was examined in Banksia woodland on the Swan Coastal Plain of Western Australia. Twenty pairs of <b>saplings</b> were selected {{and one of}} each pair was enclosed in bird-proof mesh to exclude foraging birds. <b>Saplings</b> were sampled in April 1998, prior to bird exclusion, and in August 1997, October 1997 and May 1998 after exclusion. Abundance, species richness and size of some arthropods increased on meshed <b>saplings</b> in certain months following bird exclusion. Spiders (Araneae) were most different between meshed and open <b>saplings,</b> with their abundance increasing on the <b>saplings</b> from which birds were excluded and remaining significantly more abundant after one year. The abundance of larger arthropods (in particular, spiders) increased and smaller animals decreased following bird exclusion, suggesting an interaction with birds on spiders as prey, and between spiders and their prey. Additional evidence of an effect of bird predation on the arthropod fauna {{was found in the}} amount of arthropod-related damage to leaves on meshed and open <b>saplings.</b> Damage to leaves, recorded over an 8 -week period in spring, on meshed <b>saplings</b> was 21 % of total leaf area, compared with 6 % on open <b>saplings.</b> These differences indicate that damage to canopy foliage is reduced by bird predation of herbivorous arthropods, and are consistent with trends in arthropod abundances between open and meshed <b>saplings.</b> We conclude that predation by birds affects the composition and size structure of canopy arthropod communities on eucalypts, and there is merit in initiating longer and more extensive studie...|$|R

40|$|We {{developed}} a functional-structural plant model for Fagus crenata <b>saplings</b> and calculated annual photosynthetic gains {{to determine the}} influences of foliar phenology and shoot inclination on the carbon economy of <b>saplings.</b> The model regenerated the three-dimensional shoot structure and spatial and temporal display of leaves; we calculated the hourly light interception of each leaf with a detailed light model that allowed us to estimate hourly leaf photosynthetic gain taking leaf age into account. To evaluate the importance of simultaneous foliar phenology and slanting shoots in beech <b>saplings,</b> we calculated the photosynthetic budgets for <b>saplings</b> with contrasting foliar phenologies and shoot inclinations. In our simulations, we distinguished between simultaneous and successive foliar phenologies, upright and slanting shoot inclinations, and environments with and without a vertical gradient in light intensity. Other model parameters (including photosynthesis vs. light curve, leaf size, and leaf shape) were obtained directly from live beech <b>saplings.</b> With no vertical gradient in light intensity, modeled <b>saplings</b> with simultaneous foliar phenology and slanting shoots (as in live beech) had larger annual photosynthetic gains than <b>saplings</b> with other combinations of traits. Hence, simultaneous foliar phenology and slanting shoots are efficient ways to display leaves in the shaded forest understory light regime where beech <b>saplings</b> thrive. In the presence of vertical light gradients, which can occur in canopy gaps, <b>saplings</b> with upright shoots had larger annual photosynthetic gains than counterparts with slanting shoots. Although mean daily photosynthetic gains of <b>saplings</b> with successive foliar phenology were elevated by exposing leaves to strong light when young and productive, the annual photosynthetic budget of these <b>saplings</b> was reduced (compared to <b>saplings</b> with simultaneous foliar phenology) by their relatively short leaf lifespan. Overall, our results suggest that slanting shoots with simultaneous foliar phenology are particularly successful in shaded environments, where beech often dominates, because they appear to maximize the annual carbon budget by avoiding self-shading and extending leaf lifespans...|$|R

Area of study, materials and methods: This study examined the survival of 2 -year-old <b>saplings</b> of Taxodium distichum and Metasequioia glyptostroboides (LOQS species), and Alnus japonica (LOES species), during and after total submergence. <b>Saplings</b> were completely submerged, then de-submerged to determine trends in survival and growth Main results: The M. glyptostroboides and A. japonica <b>saplings</b> could not survive prolonged submergence for more than 8 weeks, whereas <b>saplings</b> of T. distichum survived for over 2 years. Submerged <b>saplings</b> of all species showed no significant growth or modifications in morphology and anatomy under water, such as shoot elongation, adventitious root formation, and/or aerenchyma development. All T. distichum <b>saplings</b> that were de-submerged in the second year had the same pattern of shoot growth regardless of differences in timing and seasonality of de-submergence. Wood formation in T. distichum <b>saplings</b> ceased during submergence and resumed after de-submergence in spring and summer, but not in autumn. Research highlights: T. distichum <b>saplings,</b> which survived longer submergence periods than A. japonica and M. glyptostroboides, had physiological characteristics, such as suspension of growth and metabolism, which allowed survival of protracted total submergence (at least 2 years) when <b>saplings</b> were immersed during the dormant stage before leaf flushing...|$|R
