40|$|Physical {{restraint}} {{of potentially}} violent patients {{can take place}} on the floor in prone or supine positions (horizontal restraint) or, less intrusively, in standing or sitting positions (vertical restraint). The decision to use horizontal restraint may be made unnecessarily if the level of risk in an interaction is overestimated and/or the capacity to otherwise control the situation is underestimated by staff. A model of the decision-making process in this situation based on the concept of cognitive appraisal of imminent threat is proposed here. The aim of the study reported here was to test this model by examining the patient, staff, and environmental factors {{associated with the use of}} horizontal (as opposed to vertical) restraint. Logistic regression analysis of secondary data on the first-recorded episode of restraint of 261 patients occurring over a three-year period (1999 - 2001) in an acute care psychiatric trust in the UK was conducted, followed by a ROC analysis of the discriminative ability of the derived model to predict horizontal restraint. It was found that patients admitted under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act, those committing self-harm, and those with unclear thoughts and increased vocal volume prior to the incident were more likely to be restrained horizontally. Older people, those with perceived rational causation such as bad news and personal gain, and those with no obvious warning signs were less likely to be restrained horizontally. The AUC of the model was. 76 (95 % CI. 70 -. 82), indicating acceptable discriminative ability.

Anders Larsson and Åsalill Olsson Performance appraisals have been given a central role in leading businesses in the public sector and are seen as a tool to create development opportunities and achieve better results. This has resulted that performance appraisal in many organizations takes up capacity and time. This was the starting point of our interest to study whether the time spent on performance appraisals effectively pays for itself in the organization, in other words whether the effects expected actually are achieved. The paper examines first line managers` views on <b>staff</b> <b>appraisal</b> purposes and effects of a function within the Landstinget. The survey design, methodology and transaction are of qualitative and quantitative method with three different sources: literature review of previous research, interviews with first line managers in Landstinget Västmanland and the results from an employee satisfaction survey conducted on behalf of Landstinget Västmanland. The result shows that the majority of first line managers` views on the purpose of <b>staff</b> <b>appraisal</b> are that they have a focus on the individual worker and the work environment and not to any significant degree is their purpose linked to the work place goals or to improve the performance of the organization.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the experiences, understandings and concerns elementary school staff have of self-harm among Norwegian elementary school children (6 - 13 years). This is an independent research project which received no funding. Method: Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured interview guide and through an online survey designed by the authors. Data analysis was informed by both the thematic approach and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Participants: Elementary school staff in Norway. 63 staff members responded to the survey and 15 additional staff members were interviewed. All interview participants had some prior experience or knowledge of children who self-harmed. Results: Three themes resulted from the analysis: 1. Participants’ understandings of self-harm, 2. social learning of self-harm, and 3. a call for more knowledge. Staff tend to dichotomize between what is serious and what is not and express uncertainty about what behaviors should be labeled self-harm. Self-harm is frequently understood as an emotion regulation strategy or as a “cry for help” where the self-harm is seen as a clear signal of a child in distress. Staff expressed concern of social learning effects if self-harm is introduced as a topic for children. <b>Staff</b> <b>appraisals</b> of their own competence to manage children who self-harm were low, and many expressed a desire to receive outside help and to gain more knowledge of self-harm. Findings were supported by survey data. Conclusion: School staff are in a privileged position to uncover self-harm among children and provide help and early intervention. The authors suggest that staff must be provided with more knowledge on self-harm to increase visibility and understanding, and that all children who display warning signs must be spoken to individually. Increased knowledge will help staff feel more secure in dealing with children who self-harm and may increase their efficacy and promote positive attitudes. A counselor should be available at all elementary schools to provide an alternative to the external helping system which is generally less available...|$|R
