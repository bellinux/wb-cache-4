30|$|Most recently, Manchester and Mumford (2011) {{develop a}} {{structural}} model of labour supply and welfare programme participation {{that they use}} to estimate {{the costs associated with}} participating in two US in-kind programmes using a sample of single mothers. They provide estimates of the fixed costs of participating in each programme separate from the marginal cost for each programme. They find large implied psychological costs to both <b>programmes.</b> <b>Identification</b> in their model comes entirely from the structure that they impose and the non-linear budget constraints that individuals face in their single cross section of data. Our own work parallels this recent US research in several ways but we exploit variation in the budget constraint across pooled cross sections that is driven by an important reform for identification.|$|R
