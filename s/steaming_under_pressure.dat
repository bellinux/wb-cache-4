The effects of pre-treatment on ginger were studied using fresh ginger, dried ginger, fresh ginger blanched at three different times (5, 10 and 15 min) at atmospheric pressure. Steaming of dried ginger prior to steam distillation was said to hasten the process. The effects of steaming dried ginger with varied durations (30 min, 1 h and 2 h) and under varied pressures (0. 3, 0. 6 and 0. 9 bar gauge) were also studied. Ginger oleoresin was obtained through solvent extraction. The effects of solvent extraction on ginger tissues, dried and fresh were observed after 3 h of extraction. The tissues were stained with Saffranin and Fast Green. The histological analysis was done using a light microscopy (LM) and had revealed some important information about the changes in the cell's structure. Through LM studies, it was confirmed that drying was a vital procedure for pre-treatment to speed up processing time. The reconstruction of parenchyma cell walls was observed after 30 min of steaming, which prolonged the steam distillation time and 3 h of solvent extraction time was insufficient for the extraction of the oleoresin...|$|E

Forty pork legs were contaminated with Salmonella Typhimurium DT 177 and subsequently divided into 4 treatments: immersion in physiological solution for 5 seconds (control, T 1); immersion in physiological solution with 1000 ppm of organic acids for 5 seconds (T 2); sprinkling of <b>steam</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> (4 bar) at 140 ºC (T 3); and T 2 after T 3 (T 4).

50|$|In 1662 Edward Somerset, second Marquess of Worcester, {{published}} a book containing several ideas {{he had been working}} on. One was for a steam-powered pump to supply water to fountains; the device alternately used a partial vacuum and steam pressure. Two containers were alternately filled with steam, then sprayed with cold water making the steam within condense; this produced a partial vacuum that would draw water through a pipe up from a well to the container. A fresh charge of <b>steam</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> then drove the water from the container up another pipe to a higher-level header before that steam condensed and the cycle repeated. By working the two containers alternately, the delivery rate to the header tank could be increased.|$|R

5000|$|The {{importance}} of raising <b>steam</b> <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> (from a thermodynamic standpoint) {{is that it}} attains a higher temperature. Thus, any engine using high-pressure steam operates at a higher temperature and pressure differential than is possible with a low-pressure vacuum engine. The high-pressure engine thus {{became the basis for}} most further development of reciprocating steam technology. Even so, around the year 1800, [...] "high pressure" [...] amounted to what today would be considered very low pressure, i.e. 40-50 psi (276-345 kPa), the point being that the high-pressure engine in question was non-condensing, driven solely by the expansive power of the steam, and once that steam had performed work it was usually exhausted at higher-than-atmospheric pressure. The blast of the exhausting steam into the chimney could be exploited to create induced draught through the fire grate and thus increase the rate of burning, hence creating more heat in a smaller furnace, at the expense of creating back pressure on the exhaust side of the piston.|$|R
