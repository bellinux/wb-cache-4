5|$|On May 25, the Senate {{voted for}} cloture by a 70-30 vote, thus {{overcoming}} {{the threat of}} filibuster and limiting further debate on the bill.

5|$|The final {{catalyst}} {{for the expansion of}} the investigation was the Seattle General Strike, which began the day before the <b>Senate</b> <b>passed</b> Resolution 439.

5|$|In February 2013, the Philippine <b>Senate</b> <b>passed</b> a bill declaring waling-waling (Vanda sanderiana) as the {{national}} flower alongside Sampaguita. A similar bill in the House of Representatives had already been passed in 2012. Normally, the bill would become law after being signed by the President. However, it was vetoed by President Benigno Aquino III. The veto did not grant the waling-waling as the second national flower due to the confusion that it would create.|$|E

The <b>Senate</b> <b>passed</b> the Act unanimously through voice vote, and it passed the House of Representatives 265–79. Signed into law by President Harry S. Truman on August 1, 1946, it went into effect on January 1, 1947, and the Atomic Energy Commission assumed responsibility for nuclear energy from the wartime Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|On May22, a {{day after}} the typhoon struck the island, U.S. President Gerald Ford {{declared}} Guam a major disaster area. In September 1976, the United States <b>Senate</b> <b>passed</b> a bill that included aid for the storm victims. Ultimately, the U.S. government provided $200million in aid and reconstruction funding in the two years following the typhoon's passage. This included about $80million to repair Guam's military facilities, which took several years to complete. Following the typhoon's passage and through the 1980s, the island's wooden homes underwent the process of being replaced by safer concrete homes.|$|E

The measure moved for final approval to the House of Representatives, but on January 29, House Speaker Calvin Say moved to indefinitely postpone {{a vote on the}} bill, which was approved by voice vote. No votes were recorded and the move deferred action on the bill for 2010 unless two-thirds of Representatives vote to reconsider the bill, and it was considered dead.|$|E

5|$|Without a Saxbe fix, Clinton {{would have}} been ineligible {{to serve in the}} Cabinet until the {{conclusion}} of the 112th United States Congress in January 2013, near the end of Obama's elected term.

President George W.

5|$|Although the {{compromise}} passed the Senate in March 1970, it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who {{was determined to}} end silver in the coinage. The <b>Senate</b> <b>passed</b> the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a rider to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a conference committee and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as Congress had adjourned, not signing the bill would pocket veto it, Nixon hastily signed it just before midnight on December 31, 1970, only minutes before the deadline.|$|E
5000|$|Three months elapsed {{between the}} two {{rejections}} of the bill by the Senate ("rejection" [...] in this context can extend to the <b>Senate's</b> failure to <b>pass</b> the bill, or to the <b>Senate</b> <b>passing</b> it with amendments to which the House of Representatives will not agree).|$|R
50|$|Patrick {{obtained}} {{passage of}} three Senate bills {{during his first}} session, the fewest number among the five freshmen senators.

5|$|Both {{chambers}} {{worked to}} reconcile differences between their respective {{versions of the}} bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the <b>Senate</b> <b>passed</b> a compromise bill, but the House killed it on a procedural motion. On April 15, {{the last day of}} the session, which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial vetos, the health care bill was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation of a Health Policy Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured that insurance companies could not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E
5|$|Jones' top {{priority}} as governor was {{the passage of}} health care reform. He appointed two health care reform study commissions, and in May 1993, he called the legislature into a special session to consider a universal health care bill. The only measure {{to come out of}} this session was a temporary tax on health care providers. Legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be passed in the next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include universal coverage. Angered, Jones began campaigning against the bill, but the Kentucky <b>Senate</b> <b>passed</b> its version on March 22.|$|E
5|$|Much {{of what he}} did in the Senate can be {{described}} as the typical sponsorship of legislation that would benefit his state. With his sponsorship, the <b>Senate</b> <b>passed</b> a bill that would aid railroads in Florida, and another that would sell off some of the live oak reservations maintained by the Federal government for the Navy; both bills failed in the House of Representatives. He was more successful with bills aimed at prosecuting the ongoing campaign against the Seminole Indians, although the problem seems to have been overstated. His bills would provide compensation for persons who had suffered from the depredations of Indian raids, and would further the process of removing the aborigines from the state. He also introduced bills that provided for marine hospitals in port cities in Florida. None of this would have been considered exceptional for the era.|$|E
