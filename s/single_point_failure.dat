The system is netted and distributed. Every MEADS battle manager, radar, and launcher is a wireless node on the network. By virtue of multiple communications paths, the network can be expanded or contracted as the situation dictates and precludes <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>failure</b> if one node becomes inoperable.

50|$|Formation Autonomy Spacecraft with Thrust, Relnav, Attitude and Crosslink (or FASTRAC) {{is a pair}} of nanosatellites (respectively named Sara-Lily and Emma) {{developed}} and built by students at The University of Texas at Austin. The project is part of a program sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), whose goal is to lead the development of affordable space technology. The FASTRAC mission will specifically investigate technologies that facilitate the operation of multiple satellites in formation. These enabling technologies include relative navigation, cross-link communications, attitude determination, and thrust. Due to the high cost of lifting mass into orbit, there is a strong initiative to miniaturize the overall weight of spacecraft. The utilization of formations of satellites, in place of large single satellites, reduces the risk of <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>failure</b> and allows for the use of low-cost hardware.|$|E
50|$|Event tree {{analysis}} {{can be used}} in risk assessment by determining the probability that is used to determine the risk when multiplied by the hazard of the event. Event Tree Analysis is a tool that makes easy to see what pathway is creating the greatest probability of failure for a specific system. It is common to find single point failures that do not have any intervening events between the initiating event and a failure. With Event Tree Analysis <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>failure</b> can be targeted to include an intervening step that will reduce the overall probability of failure and thus reducing the risk of the system. The idea of adding an intervening event can happen anywhere in the system for any pathway that generates too great of a risk, the added intermediate event can reduce the probability and thus reduce the risk.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Traditional {{methods for}} testing {{integrated}} circuits will reject circuits with a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>failure</b> {{regardless of the}} functionality of the chip {{from the perspective of}} the ultimate application. As the size of integrated circuits increase, the probability of such a <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>failure</b> increases resulting in a trend of decreasing yield with increasing circuit size. In many applications, the circuits perform processing that is inherently robust to errors (e. g., signal processing, compression, error correction) and therefore many of the rejected chips function acceptably well. This motivates the area of error tolerant circuit design and test in which one seeks to characterize acceptable errors, design architectures most robust to errors, and develop automated tests to accept or bin chips according to functionality. In this paper we describe a hardware testbed developed to investigate the error tolerant properties of an iterative decoder. Specifically, an FPGA-based hardware simulator for a systematic repeat accumulate code was designed. This design includes the capability to insert logic errors at various locations in the data path and to vary the level of parallelism. The testbed provides rapid evaluation of the effects of many single point circuit errors. Analyzing the architecture, we characterize errors as either catastrophic or non-catastrophic and further predict the loss of non-catastrophic using modified SNR-threshold prediction methods (e. g., EXIT charts). These quasi-analytical predictions correlate well with the collected experimental data from the testbed. I...|$|E

30|$|In the NEMO basic protocol, {{there are}} four kinds of {{communication}} entities, namely mobile routers (MR), mobile network nodes (MNN), access routers (AR), and home agent (HA), respectively. The MR plays the role as gateways for all the MNN in the network. Besides, these MRs will be the gateway to connect MNN with the core network through AR and forwards the data traffic for the entire mobile network. More specifically, the MR and HA exchange the mobility management signaling messages once the mobile network changes its points of attachment. Due to signaling management and packets delivery, the mobile router may become the performance bottleneck and <b>single</b> <b>point</b> <b>failure</b> by the malicious attack.|$|E
