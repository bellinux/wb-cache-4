40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the methods used}} by the <b>Budget</b> <b>Standards</b> Unit at the Social Policy Research Centre to develop a set of indicative <b>budget</b> <b>standards</b> {{for a range of}} Australian households.

The sensitivity of <b>budget</b> <b>standards</b> to some of the key assumptions and judgements made in developing them is illustrated in two examples: housing costs and spatial variations in prices. The paper concludes that one important contribution that <b>budget</b> <b>standards</b> research can make to the discussion of the adequacy of household incomes is in providing a transparent framework for selecting items needed to maintain a particular standard of living and translating them through prices into the budgets required to purchase them. ...|$|R
