40|$|Purpose:The {{purpose of}} this study as a part of Trafikverkets {{continues}} improvement work is to create ahigher society value with less delayed train traffic. This study will analyze if it’stechnical/administrative possible to eliminate or reduce the delays which accrue when switcheswith <b>swing</b> <b>nose</b> <b>crossing</b> is not in control. The issue has been segmented in three sub issues: 1. How does a switch with <b>swing</b> <b>nose</b> <b>crossing</b> work and which factors leads to a stop intraffic? 2. What knowledge does train engineer have and how do they work today? 3. Is it possible to change the current regulation without decrease the safety?Methodology:Literature study, interview and observation has been performed to see which issues switcheshas and what underlying effects that causes them. A workshop has been held with teacher andstudents in a school for train engineer. Collected data has been analyzed for compilation of thestudies result. Findings:As the regulation is written today it creates a complete stop in traffic when a switch with swingnose crossing goes in control. The studies result shows that train engineers has anunderstanding of the how switches with <b>swing</b> <b>nose</b> <b>crossing</b> works and therefore could it bepossible to alter the regulation. A change in this regulation could mean less delayed traintraffic. But also a greater risk for more collision between train and switches which could lead tothat more switches have to be repaired. A standardized approach in how to control a switchcould decrease this risk. Implications:The {{purpose of this}} study through the problem definition is deemed answered. Theunderstanding on the train engineer awareness of switches with <b>swing</b> <b>nose</b> <b>crossing</b> and theirdemands has been a great significance for the development work. More interviews andworkshops would have enhanced the scientific result. Recommendation:I advocate for a change in the regulation so that train engineer are allowed to pass a switch with swingnose crossing even if it’s not in control. There is also of great weight to study the back laying reasonsfor why train engineer misjudge switches position and why the switches doesn’t go in control...|$|E

40|$|A rat {{model was}} used to {{determine}} whether prenatal cocaine exposure results in long-term changes in hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning. Pregnant dams received either 40 mg/kg cocaine HCl SC (COC), an equal volume of 0. 9 % saline (SAL), or received no injections (UT) from gestational day 8 through 20. SAL animals were also pair-fed to COC subjects. Experiment 1 tested one-trial contextual fear conditioning in adult male offspring. Freezing and defecation were measures of fear. Prenatal cocaine exposure did not affect context conditioning, but there was an overall increase in SAL and COC defecation, indicating an increased generalized fear in these subjects. To better mimic binge cocaine use, COC dams in Experiment 2 and 3 received 20 mg/kg cocaine HCl SC, b. i. d. A preliminary open field task revealed that SAL offspring were more exploratory than UT controls and that females were more active than males. In Experiment 2, adult male and female offspring received 4 days of context conditioning and 3 days of no-shock extinction. During extinction, access to an adjacent chamber enabled the observation of four additional measures of fear: side <b>crossing,</b> latency, <b>nose</b> <b>crossing,</b> and side-differential. Experiment 2 repeated previous reports of gender-specific contextual fear. Males showed a greater level of freezing and defecation, higher latencies and side-differentials, and a lower level of side crossings and nose crossings than females. Prenatal cocaine exposure resulted in exaggerated gender-specific fear conditioning as measured by nose-crossing and side differential during extinction. Experiment 3 tested the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on latent inhibition (LI) of contextual fear in year-old females. Vertical <b>nose</b> <b>crossing</b> (VNC), freezing, and defecation were measures of fear. LI was evidenced as an attenuation of freezing and VNC in pre-exposed (PE) animals compared to non-pre-exposed subjects. Prenatal cocaine exposure resulted in an enhanced LI effect. COC females showed a low level of baseline VNC, but COC-PE subjects showed a greater level of VNC than controls following the first shock during conditioning. The results of these experiments suggest that the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure on hippocampal-dependent learning are subtle, selective, and gender specific. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method for}} robust geometry optimisation of railway crossings is presented. The robustness {{is achieved by}} optimising the crossing geometry for a representative set of wheel profiles. As {{a basis for the}} optimisation, a crossing geometry is created where rail cross-sectional profiles and longitudinal height profiles of both wing rails and <b>crossing</b> <b>nose</b> are parameterised. Based on the approximation that the two problems are decoupled, separate optimisations are performed for the cross-sectional rail profiles and the longitudinal height profiles. The rail cross sections are optimised to minimise the maximum Hertzian wheel-rail contact pressure. The longitudinal height profiles are optimised to minimise the accumulated damage in the wing rail to <b>crossing</b> <b>nose</b> transition zone. The accumulated damage is approximated using an objective criterion that accounts for the angle of the wheel trajectory reversal during the transition from the wing rail to the <b>crossing</b> <b>nose</b> as well as the distribution of transition points for the utilised wheel profile set. It is found that small nonlinear height deviations from a linear longitudinal wing rail profile in the transition zone can reduce the objective compared to the nominal design. It is further demonstrated that the variation in wheel profile shapes, lateral wheel displacements and the feasible transition zone length of the crossing will determine the longitudinal height profiles of the wing rail and <b>crossing</b> <b>nose</b> if all wheel profiles are to make their transition within the transition zone...|$|R

40|$|A wheel {{passing a}} {{crossing}} nose: Dynamic analysis under high axle loads using {{finite element model}}ling* Martin Pletz 1, 2, Werner Daves 1, 2 and Heinz Ossberger 3 A finite element model for the process of a wheel passing a crossing is presented. In the dynamic model, one wheel, the wing rails and the <b>crossing</b> <b>nose</b> (frog) are modelled. The bogie, the complete wheel set {{and the support of}} the crossing are represented as a system consisting of masses, springs, dampers and friction-generating elements. The rolling/sliding behaviour between the wheel and crossing is studied using the proposed model. Due to the conical shape of the wheel tread and multiple contacts between the wheel and the crossing parts, sliding occurs during the transition of the wheel from the wing rail to the <b>crossing</b> <b>nose</b> or vice versa. At the same time, an impact occurs that produces high contact forces. The parameters of the model are the train speed and passing direction, the wheel and the crossing geometry, the axle load and the support of the crossing. In this paper, the crossover process is studied for high axle loads and compared with results of simulations using a normal axle load. Further parameters are three train velocities, both directions of passing and different crossing materials.

The surveys carried out on out of use equipment, such as rails or switches, show that these equipments fail by wear after quite a long period of use, but they can fail by fatigue in a substantially shorter time. In service, crossings are submitted to rolling, impact and sliding stresses. The impact-sliding {{is the result of the}} wheel transition from rail wing to <b>crossing</b> <b>nose.</b> Very high contact forces act on the <b>crossing</b> <b>nose</b> while such wheels are passing over it.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{numerical}} simulation tools {{have been developed}} to predict the kinematic motion of a railway wheelset at a crossing and derive the dynamic vertical force occurring {{as a result of the}} wheel load transfer between the wing rail and the <b>crossing</b> <b>nose.</b> The tool has been used to show that for new crossing and a large representative range of worn wheels, the peak dynamic force is strongly influenced by the state of wear of the wheel and its lateral position (higher force occurs as the wheel moves towards flange contact on the <b>crossing</b> <b>nose).</b> Arguably, as the crossing wears to conform to the shape of the wheels travelling over it, this tendency may reduce over time. It is suggested that such a tool may be a powerful and fast way of optimising crossing geometry so that damage arising from dynamic impact loads are minimised at the early stage of a crossing life cycle.

Above the passenger platform was the 30 ft of the conical housing for the mooring gear. A lower platform 142 ft above the ground accommodated searchlights and signalling gear in a gallery 4 ft wide.The top platform, at the height of 170 ft, from which passengers embarked and disembarked to and from the airships, was 40 ft in diameter and encircled by a heavy parapet. The top rail of the parapet formed a track on which a gangway, let down from the airship, ran on wheels to give freedom for the airship to move around the tower as it swung with the wind. An electric passenger lift ran up the centre of the tower, encircled by a stairway to provide foot access.The upper portion of the tower, from the passenger platform upwards, was a circular steel turret surmounted by a truncated cone with its top 23 ft above the passenger platform. A three-part telescopic arm, mounted on gimbals, projected through an opening at the top, free to swing from the vertical in any direction up to 30 degrees of movement. The top of the arm consisted of a bell-shaped cup mounted to rotate on ball bearings.A cable extended through the bell-mouth which, linked to a cable dropped from airship to be moored, enabled the nose of the airship to be drawn down until a cone on the nose locked home into the cup and so secured the airship to the tower. The telescopic arm was then centred, locked in the vertical position, and made free to rotate on a vertical axis so the airship could <b>swing,</b> <b>nose</b> to tower, in any direction of the wind.In the machinery house {{at the base of the}} tower three steam-driven winches operated the hauling gear through drums 5 ft in diameter to give cable hauling speeds of 50 feet a minute.|$|R

40|$|Turnouts (Switches & Crossings) are {{important}} components in railway networks, as {{they provide the}} necessary flexibility for train operations by allowing trains to change among the tracks. But the turnout’s geometry with discontinuity in rail profiles and lack of transition curve causes additional wear both on track and on vehicle. The main goal of this MSc thesis is to investigate the influence of turnouts on wheel wear of a freight vehicle. This will be obtained by simulations in the commercial MBS software GENSYS. The wheel-rail contact is modelled according to Hertz’s theory and Kalker’s simplified theory, with the FASTSIM algorithm, and the wear calculations are performed according to Archard’s law. Wheel wear is estimated by considering variations in parameters which have effect on wheel-rail contact. All these variations are common in daily rail operation, and they are caused by it, i. e. worn wheel profiles, worn <b>crossing</b> <b>nose</b> and different stiffness of the stock and the switch rails {{at the beginning of}} the turnout. Moreover, the wheel wear is calculated for both possible directions which a vehicle can run, the diverging and the straight direction of the turnout. Especially for the straight direction, various running speeds have been tested as the speed limit when the vehicle follows the straight direction is higher than for the diverging part. Running with worn wheel profiles has the greatest impact in terms of increasing the wheel wear, especially on the outer part of wheel tread. In addition, the worn <b>crossing</b> <b>nose</b> results in increased wheel wear in this area. The results of the simulations concerning the different stiffness showed that the wheel wear caused by the contact of wheel and stock rail increases whereas the wear caused by the contact with the switch rail is kept at about the same level or decreases. It is concluded that turnouts have a significant impact on wheel wear, mainly because of the discontinuity in rail geometry and all the investigated parameters increase this impact. Moreover, great differences in wear values for areas close to each other are observed, mainly because of the wear coefficient values chosen in Archard’s wear map...|$|R

40|$|A {{state-of-the-art}} {{study on}} ground-borne vibration induced by railway turnouts (switches & crossings) is presented. Vibration generating mechanisms and possibilities for cost-effective mitigation measures are discussed. A brief literature survey {{and examples of}} results from vibration measurements performed by the Schweizerische Bundesbahnen (SBB) are presented. The present work was performed within the EU FP 7 project RIVAS (Railway Induced Vibration Abatement Solutions). Mitigation measures for turnouts described in the literature mainly aim at reducing the dynamic wheel-rail contact force (impact load) in the crossing panel. This is supported by field observations of amplified ground-borne vibration at turnouts, indicating {{that there is a}} need to improve the design of these track components. A smooth wheel transition between wing rail and <b>crossing</b> <b>nose</b> is important to achieve low energy impacts on the crossing. Measures to mitigate the vibrations include the use of soft or stiff Under Sleeper Pads (USP) for better and more stable turnout geometry over time. The use of USP may also reduce the magnitude of vibrations transferred from turnout to soil. Other measures include improving the design of the crossing panel (material and geometry of <b>crossing</b> <b>nose</b> and wing rails) and the use of more resilient rail pads. Results from a Swiss test campaign at two different sites (Rubigen and Le Landeron), using stiff USP in four turnouts, are presented and compared to results from four nominal turnouts without USP. However, the vibrations measured at Le Landeron, and even more so for Rubigen, seem to be significantly influenced by the turnout and soil conditions. It is important to accurately determine the condition of each turnout to enable a meaningful comparison between the turnouts and to draw conclusions on the influence of turnout mitigation measures on vibration emission. The best approach to reduce the amplification of vibration is a system approach where different parameters (such as rail profiles, rail material, resilient layers) are designed to interact in a harmonious and robust way. It is thus important to identify the combination of parameters that defines the design of an optimum turnout. Modelling is required to optimize the wheel transition over the crossing panel. Further tests are needed to define the relevant geometric parameters influencing the wheel trajectory and the amplified vibrations. If an improvement of the dynamic wheel-rail interaction (wheel transition) can be accomplished that reduces impact loads on the crossing panel, both vibration magnitudes and the need for crossing panel maintenance can be reduced...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, a {{methodology}} for simulation of track settlement in railway turnouts (switches and crossings, S&C) is presented. The methodology predicts the accumulated settlement {{for a given}} set of traffic loads using an iterative and cross-disciplinary procedure. The different modules of the procedure include (I) simulation of dynamic vehicle–track interaction in a turnout applying a validated software for multibody vehicle dynamics considering space-dependent track properties, (II) calculation of load distribution and sleeper–ballast contact pressure using a detailed finite element model of a turnout that includes all of the rails (stock rails, switch rails, closure rails, <b>crossing</b> <b>nose,</b> wing rails and check rails), rail pads, baseplates and sleepers on ballast, (III) prediction of track settlement for a given number of load cycles and (IV) calculation of accumulated track settlement at each sleeper and the resulting vertical track irregularity along the turnout which is used as input in the next step of the iteration. The iteration scheme is demonstrated by calculating track settlement at the crossing when the studied turnout is exposed to freight traffic in the facing move of the through route. Due {{to the design of}} the crossing panel and the character of the impact loads induced by the transfer of wheels between wing rail and <b>crossing</b> <b>nose,</b> the load transferred into the track bed is not uniform and the resulting spatially varying (differential) settlement leads to vertical irregularities in track geometry. In the first paper of this work, track settlement is predicted using a discrete empirical model that gives the local vertical settlement {{based on the number of}} load cycles and the prescribed distribution of sleeper–ballast contact pressure. Such a model does not account for the material behaviour in, or the interaction between, different regions of the track substructure. In the second paper, a computationally efficient method for predicting long-term settlement in generic configurations of track (various combinations of track superstructure and substructure and nonsymmetric loading conditions) using a constitutive model accounting for the multi-axial stressstrain condition in the track substructure is developed. A key ingredient of the method is that the selected constitutive model evaluates track settlement in the cycle domain. The constitutive model is adopted for both the ballast and the sub-ballast but with different parameter sets. The dimensions of the three-dimensional finite element model of the track substructure and the number of sleepers that need to be included to obtain accurate settlement at the crossing are investigated. To predict a reliable distribution of settlement under a given sleeper, it is concluded that the loading on at least two sleepers on either side of the sleeper must also be included in the model...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} for simulating wear, rolling contact fatigue, and plastic deformation for a mixed traffic situation in {{switches and crossings}} (S&C) has been developed. The methodology includes simulation of dynamic vehicle—track interaction considering stochastic variations in input data, simulation of wheel—rail contacts accounting for non-linear material properties and plasticity, and simulation of wear and plastic deformation in the rail during {{the life of the}} S&C component. To find means of improving the switch panel design, the geometry of a designed track gauge variation in the switch panel has been represented in a parametric way. For traffic in the facing and trailing moves of the through route, an optimum solution was identified and then validated by evaluating a wide set of simulation cases (using different wheel profiles). The optimum design includes a 12 mm maximum gauge widening. Several crossing geometries were investigated to find an optimal geometric design for the <b>crossing</b> <b>nose</b> and wing rails. The MaKüDe design showed the best performance for moderately worn wheel profiles in both running directions (facing and trailing moves). In connection with reduced support stiffness (e. g. elastic rail pads), this crossing design is predicted to lead to a significant reduction of impact loads and consequently provide a high potential of life-cycle cost reduction...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} of the effects of nose length, fuselage length, and nose fineness ratio on the static longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of an airplane model with a swept wing and low tail and of a second model with a highly tapered wing of moderate sweep and a T-tail. The tests were conducted in the Langley high-speed 7 - by 10 -foot tunnel at Mach numbers from 0. 60 to 0. 92. The <b>nose</b> and body <b>cross</b> sections were circular. For either the model with the swept wing and low tail or the model with the highly tapered wing of moderate sweep and the T-tail, the effects of forebody changes amounted primarily to rotations of the pitching-moment curves (changes in static margin) over the test ranges of angle of attack and Mach number. For the range of body shapes investigated the longitudinal stability at low lift is decreased by an increase in nose length or in fuselage length or by a reduction in nose fineness ratio when the fuselage length is held constant. In general, the stability for all model configurations showed substantially the same variation with changes in forebody area moment. The forebody changes did not alter the angle of attack at which an unstable break occurred in the moment contribution of the T-tail but did alter somewhat the magnitude of the instability...|$|R
40|$|Methods for simulation-based {{optimisation}} of {{the design}} of railway turnouts (switches & crossings, S&C) are developed and demonstrated. Building on knowledge of dynamic wheel–rail interaction in turnouts, it is investigated how rail profile degradation can be reduced by the optimisation of geometry and component stiffness of the track superstructure. It is assumed that reduced rail profile degradation will reduce the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of turnouts. In order to obtain robust optimised designs that perform well in situ, the influence of spread in traffic parameters, such as wheel profile and wheel–rail friction coefficient, is accounted for in the optimisations. For this purpose, studies of the correlation between wheel profile characteristics and damage in S&C are performed to allow for an efficient parameter sampling using the Latin Hypercube Sampling method. Track gauge optimisation in the switch panel is performed using a multi-objective optimisation approach to highlight the design trade-off in performance between different traffic routes and moves. The objective is to minimise rail and wheel wear as estimated by the energy dissipation in the wheel‒rail contacts. As track gauge widening affects the switch rail design, the switch rail geometry {{is linked to the}} gauge widening in the parameterisation. It is found that gauge configurations with a large maximum gauge widening for the straight stock rail are optimal for both the through and diverging routes, while the results for the curved stock rail show a more significant route dependence. A method for the optimisation of switch rail profile geometry is presented, where the geometry parameterisation is inspired by a manufacturing process for switch rails. It is found that increased profile height and increased profile shoulder protuberance are preferred to reduce the energy dissipation and wheel‒rail contact pressures when a nominal S 1002 wheel profile is used as input. It is concluded that accurate constraints on allowable switch rail loading need to be established to determine the feasible design space for switch rail geometry optimisation. A method for the optimisation of crossing geometry is also introduced. The rail cross-sections are optimised for minimum wheel‒rail contact pressure. Further, the longitudinal height profiles of the wing rails and <b>crossing</b> <b>nose</b> are optimised to minimise an estimate of the accumulated damage in the transition zone. The optimisation is computationally efficient which makes it possible to account for very large samples of wheel profiles. An investigation and demonstration of the constraints imposed on the crossing design by the spread in profile and lateral displacement of passing wheels is presented. Supplementary to the optimisation studies is the comparison of simulation results to field measurement data to evaluate and validate the accuracy of the utilised model of dynamic vehicle‒track interaction, as well as a demonstration of a methodology that simulates rail profile degradation for a given mixed traffic situation...|$|R
