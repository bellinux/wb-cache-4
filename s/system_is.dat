40|$|AbstractThe {{problems}} arising {{at operation}} of force compensating <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> considered. The necessity to apply additional speed restriction <b>systems</b> <b>was</b> proved. Two approaches to implement speed restriction <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> proposed due to {{application of a}} nonlinear negative feedback of speed and with use of the motor acceleration control. The ways of considered <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> proposed, the analysis of their operation in static and dynamic modes was made. Operation simulation of speed restriction <b>systems</b> <b>was</b> performed while operating under conditions of impact of various external efforts. Pilot studies’ results in relation to restriction <b>systems</b> operation <b>were</b> given. Advantages and disadvantages of proposed speed restriction <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> reviewed.
