50|$|The {{mammalian}} CPEB3 ribozyme is a <b>self</b> <b>cleaving</b> non-coding RNA {{located in}} the second intron of the CPEB3 gene which belongs to a family of genes regulating messenger RNA polyadenylation. This ribozyme is highly conserved andfound only in mammals. The CPEB3 ribozyme is structurally and biochemically related to the human hepatitis delta virus ribozyme. Other HDV-like ribozymes have been identified and confirmed to be active in vitro {{in a number of}} eukaryotes.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{having only}} four choices for each monomer unit (nucleotides), {{compared}} to 20 amino acid side chains found in proteins, ribozymes have diverse structures and mechanisms. In many cases {{they are able}} to mimic the mechanism used by their protein counterparts. For example, in <b>self</b> <b>cleaving</b> ribozyme RNAs, an in-line SN2 reaction is carried out using the 2’ hydroxyl group as a nucleophile attacking the bridging phosphate and causing 5’ oxygen of the N+1 base to act as a leaving group. In comparison, RNase A, a protein that catalyzes the same reaction, uses a coordinating histidine and lysine to act as a base to attack the phosphate backbone.|$|E
50|$|Twister {{ribozyme}} {{like most}} other small <b>self</b> <b>cleaving</b> ribozymes cleaves a specific phopshodiester bond into two products: a 5' product containing 2'3' -cyclic phosphate on the 3' end and a 3' product with a 5' hydroxyl. So far, {{it is known that}} rate of reaction of twister is affected by pH and divalent metals. Metals increase the rate of reaction, however, they most likely play a structural role since the rate of the reaction seemed to be same in different divalent metals. A hill shaped pH-rate profile indicates that there is probably a general acid-general base catalysis involved like the hammerhead ribozyme. However, conclusive evidence for acid-base catalysis is still being pursued.|$|E

40|$|Fusobacterium nucleatum is an oral anaerobe {{associated}} with periodontal disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes and colorectal carcinoma. A serine endopeptidase of 61 – 65 kDa capable of damaging host tissue and of inactivating immune effectors was detected previously in F. nucleatum. Here {{we describe the}} identification of this serine protease, named fusolisin, in three oral F. nucleatum sub-species. Gel zymogram revealed fusobacterial proteolytic activity with molecular masses ranging from 55 – 101 kDa. All of the detected proteases were inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor PMSF. analysis revealed {{that all of the}} detected proteases are encoded by genes encoding an open reading frame (ORF) with a calculated mass of approximately 115 kDa. Bioinformatics analysis of the identified ORFs demonstrated that they consist of three domains characteristic of autotransporters of the type Va secretion system. Our results suggest that the F. nucleatum fusolisins are derived from a precursor of approximately 115 kDa. After crossing the cytoplasmic membrane and cleavage of the leader sequence, the C-terminal autotransporter domain of the remaining 96 – 113 kDa protein is embedded in the outer membrane and delivers the N-terminal S 8 serine protease passenger domain to the outer cell surface. In most strains the N-terminal catalytic 55 – 65 kDa domain <b>self</b> <b>cleaves</b> and liberates itself from the autotransporter domain after its transfer across the outer cell membrane. In F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 this autocatalytic activity is less efficient resulting in a full length membrane-anchored serine protease.

50|$|Recently inteins {{have been}} used to purify {{proteins}} based on self aggregating peptides. Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are a useful tool in biotechnology. Fused with target protein, they tend to form aggregates inside the cells. This eliminates the chromatographic step needed in protein purification. The ELP tags {{have been used}} in the fusion protein of intein, so that the aggregates can be isolated without chromatography (by centrifugation) and then intein and tag can be cleaved in controlled manner to release the target protein into solution. This protein isolation can be done using continuous media flow, yielding high amounts of protein, making this process more economically efficient than conventional methods. Another group of researchers used smaller self aggregating tags to isolate target protein. Small amphipathic peptides 18A and ELK16 (figure 5) were used to form <b>self</b> <b>cleaving</b> aggregating protein.|$|E
40|$|Markers of {{cell cycle}} stage allow {{estimation}} of cell cycle dynamics in cell culture and during embryonic development. The Fucci system incorporates genetically encoded probes that highlight G 1 and S/G 2 /M {{phases of the}} cell cycle allowing live imaging. However the available mouse models that incorporate Fucci are beset by problems with transgene inactivation, varying expression level, lack of conditional potential and/or {{the need to maintain}} separate transgenes-there is no transgenic mouse model that solves all these problems. To address these shortfalls we re-engineered the Fucci system to create 2 bicistronic Fucci variants incorporating both probes fused using the Thosea asigna virus 2 A (T 2 A) <b>self</b> <b>cleaving</b> peptide. We characterize these variants in stable 3 T 3 cell lines. One of the variants (termed Fucci 2 a) faithfully recapitulated the nuclear localization and cell cycle stage specific florescence of the original Fucci system. We go on to develop a conditional mouse allele (R 26 Fucci 2 aR) carefully designed for high, inducible, ubiquitous expression allowing investigation of cell cycle status in single cell lineages within the developing embryo. We demonstrate the utility of R 26 Fucci 2 aR for live imaging by using high resolution confocal microscopy of ex vivo lung, kidney and neural crest development. Using our 3 T 3 system we describe and validate a method to estimate cell cycle times from relatively short time-lapse sequences that we then apply to our neural crest data. The Fucci 2 a system and the R 26 Fucci 2 aR mouse model are compelling new tools for the investigation of cell cycle dynamics in cell culture and during mouse embryonic development...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Reporter gene imaging for {{gene and}} cell therapy often {{requires}} expression of multiple transgenes {{by the same}} construct. Different strategies have been used but systematic comparison is lacking. Here, we report {{a comparison of the}} currently available approaches (including internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES), 2 A-like peptides, and a bidirectional promoter) that allow expression of multiple reporter genes (i. e. green fluorescent protein (eGFP), firefly luciferase (fLuc), Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tTK)) in a lentiviral vector context, both in cell culture and in rodent brain. Methods: LV transfer plasmids were constructed with both eGFP and fLuc linked by the EMCV IRES, four different <b>self</b> <b>cleaving</b> 2 A-like sequences, a 10 -fold repeat of a 9 -nucleotide cellular sequence with IRES-activity (10 CI), as a fusion protein and using a bidirectional promoter. eGFP and fLuc expression after LV transduction was verified by fluorescence microscopy, western blot (WB), FACS and fLuc assay. In addition, LVs were stereotactically injected into the mouse striatum. Expression was measured by BLI and stereological quantification of eGFP-positive volume after eGFP immunohistochemistry. Using two different 2 A-sequences, a multicistronic LV expressing eGFP, fLuc and HSV-tTK was constructed. Reporter gene expression was tested by fLuc assay, FACS analysis and a suicide gene assay in cellulo. Results: eGFP and fLuc expression in transduced cells was obtained from all constructs. WB confirmed expression of both reporters and showed predominantly cleaved protein for most 2 A-like peptides. Expression of eGFP and fLuc reporters was high in cellulo and in vivo for the constructs containing IRES and 2 A-sequences as compared to the other constructs. Efficient eGFP, fLuc and HSV-tTK expression was shown in transduced cells with a triple reporter lentivector using two distinct 2 A-like sequences. Conclusion: The EMCV IRES and self-cleaving 2 A-like peptides are most suitable for efficient coexpression of multiple imaging reporters in rodent brain using multicistronic lentivectors. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The rubella virus (RUB) nonstructural protein (NS) open {{reading frame}} (ORF) encodes a {{polypeptide}} precursor that is proteolytically <b>self</b> <b>cleaved</b> into two replicase components involved in viral RNA replication. A putative EF-hand Ca 2 +-binding motif that was conserved across different genotypes of RUB was predicted within the nonstructural protease that cleaves the precursor by using bioinformatics tools. To probe the metal-binding properties of this motif, we used an established grafting approach and engineered the 12 -residue Ca 2 +-coordinating loop into a non-Ca 2 +-binding scaffold protein, CD 2. The grafted EF-loop bound to Ca 2 + and its trivalent analogs Tb 3 + and La 3 + with Kds of 214, 47, and 14 μM, respectively. Mutations (D 1210 A and D 1217 A) {{of two of the}} potential Ca 2 +-coordinating ligands in the EF-loop led to the elimination of Tb 3 + binding. Inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to confirm the presence of Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]/[protein] = 0. 7 ± 0. 2) in an NS protease minimal metal-binding domain, RUBCa, that spans the EF-hand motif. Conformational studies on RUBCa revealed that Ca 2 + binding induced local conformational changes and increased thermal stability (ΔTm = 4. 1 °C). The infectivity of an RUB infectious cDNA clone containing the mutations D 1210 A/D 1217 A was decreased by ∼ 20 -fold in comparison to the wild-type (wt) clone, and these mutations rapidly reverted to the wt sequence. The NS protease containing these mutations was less efficient at precursor cleavage than the wt NS protease at 35 °C, and the mutant NS protease was temperature sensitive at 39 °C, confirming that the Ca 2 +-binding loop played a structural role in the NS protease and was specifically required for optimal stability under physiological conditions...|$|R

40|$|Triggering and {{propagating}} an intracellular innate {{immune response}} {{is essential for}} control of viral infections. RNase L is a host endoribonuclease and a pivotal component of innate immunity that cleaves viral and cellular RNA within single-stranded loops releasing small structured RNAs with 5 ′-hydroxyl (5 ′-OH) and 3 ′-monophosphoryl (3 ′-p) groups. In 2007, we reported that RNase L <b>cleaves</b> <b>self</b> RNA to produce small RNAs that function as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). However, the precise sequence and structure of PAMP RNAs produced by RNase L is unknown. Here we used hepatitis C virus RNA as substrate to characterize RNase L mediated cleavage products [named suppressor of virus RNA (svRNA) ] {{for their ability to}} activate RIG-I like receptors (RLR). The NS 5 B region of HCV RNA was cleaved by RNase L to release an svRNA that bound to RIG-I, displacing its repressor domain and stimulating its ATPase activity while signaling to the IFN-β gene in intact cells. All three of these RIG-I functions were dependent on the presence in svRNA of the 3 ′-p. Furthermore, svRNA suppressed HCV replication in vitro through a mechanism involving IFN production and triggered a RIG-I-dependent hepatic innate immune response in mice. RNase L and OAS (required for its activation) were both expressed in hepatocytes from HCV-infected patients, raising the possibility that the OAS/RNase L pathway might suppress HCV replication in vivo. It is proposed that RNase L mediated cleavage of HCV RNA generates svRNA that activates RIG-I, thus propagating innate immune signaling to the IFN-β gene...|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of DNA complementary to rice ragged stunt oryzavirus (RRSV) genome segment 8 (S 8) of an isolate from Thailand was determined. RRSV S 8 is 1 914 bp {{in size and}} contains a single large open reading frame (ORF) spanning nucleotides 23 to 1 810 which is capable of encoding a protein of M(r) 67 348. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of a ~ 43 K virion polypeptide matched to that inferred for an internal region of the S 8 coding sequence. These {{data suggest that the}} 43 K protein is encoded by S 8 and is derived by a proteolytic cleavage. Predicted polypeptide sizes from this possible cleavage of S 8 protein are 26 K and 42 K. Polyclonal antibodies raised against a maltose binding protein (MBP) -S 8 fusion polypeptide (expressed in Escherichia coli) recognised four RRSV particle associated polypeptides of M(r) 67 K, 46 K, 43 K and 26 K and all except the 26 K polypeptide were also highly immunoreactive to polyclonal antibodies raised against purified RRSV particles. Cleavage of the MBP-S 8 fusion polypeptide with protease Factor X produced the expected 40 K MBP and two polypeptides of apparent M(r) 46 K and 26 K. Antibodies to purified RRSV particles reacted strongly with the intact fusion protein and the 46 K cleavage product but weakly to the 26 K product. Furthermore, in vitro transcription and translation of the S 8 coding region revealed a post-translational self cleavage of the 67 K polypeptide to 46 K and 26 K products. These data indicate that S 8 encodes a structural polypeptide, the majority of which is auto- catalytically cleaved to 26 K and 46 K proteins. The data also suggest that the 26 K protein is the <b>self</b> <b>cleaving</b> protease and that the 46 K product is further processed or undergoes stable conformational changes to a ~ 43 K major capsid protein...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{consumption}} worldwide {{is constantly}} increasing, bringing {{with it the}} demand for low cost, environmentally friendly and efficient energy technologies. One of these promising technologies is thermoelectrics in which electric power is harvested from waste heat energy. The efficiency of a thermoelectric device {{is determined by the}} dimensionless figure of merit ZT = σS²T/k where σ is the electrical conductivity, S is the thermopower, k is the thermal conductivity, and T is the average temperature. In this thesis we investigate the use of nanostructuring, which has been known to lead to significant reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity to maximise the figure of merit. One of the most successful bulk thermoelectric materials is Bi₂Te₃, with a ZT of unity at room temperature. Here we investigate the effects of nanostructuring on the thermoelectric properties of Bi₂Te₃. Sub- 100 nm ₂Te₃ nanoparticles were successfully synthesized and the figure of merit was found to be ZT ~ 5 X 10 ⁻⁵ at room temperature. The effect of a ligand exchange treatment to replace the long chain organic ligand on the as-synthesized nanoparticles with a short chain alkyl ligand was explored. After ligand exchange treatment with hydrazine the figure of merit of sub- 100 nm Bi₂Te₃ was found to increase by two fold to ZT ~ 1 X 10 ⁻⁴ at room temperature. Overall the figure of merit is low compared to other nanostructured Bi₂Te₃, this was attributed to the extremely low electrical conductivity. The thermopower and thermal conductivity were found to be ~ 96 μVK⁻¹ and ~ 0. 38 Wm⁻¹ K⁻¹ at 300 K respectively, which show improvements over other nanostructured Bi₂Te₃. Further optimisation of the figure of merit was also investigated by incorporating Cu, Ni and Co dopants. The most successful of these attempts was Co in which 14. 5 % Co relative to Bi was successfully incorporated into sub- 100 nm Bi₂Te₃. The figure of merit of nanostructured Bi₁. ₇₁Co₀. ₂₉Te₁. ₇₁ alloy was found to increase by 40 % to a ZT ~ 1. 4 X 10 ⁻⁴ at room temperature. Although overall the figure of merit is low, the effect of Co alloying and hydrazine treatment shows potential as a route to optimise the figure of merit. A potential novel material for thermoelectrics applications is inorganicorganic perovskite single crystals. Here we report a synthetic strategy to successfully grow large millimetre scale single crystals of MAPbBr₃₋xClx, FAPbBr₃₋xClx, and MAPb₁-xSnxBr₃ (MA = methylammonium and FA = formamidinium) using inverse temperature crystallisation (ITC) in a matter of days. This is the first reported case of mixed Br/Cl single crystals with a FA cation and mixed Pb/Sn based perovskites grown using ITC. The bandgap of these single crystals was successfully tuned by altering the halide and metal site composition. It was found that single crystals of FAPbBr₃₋xClx were prone to surface degradation with increased synthesis time. This surface degradation was observed to be reversible by placing the single crystals in an antisolvent such as chloroform. A tentative model was proposed to analyse the IV characteristics of the single crystal perovskites in order to extract mobilities and diffusion lengths. The MAPbBr₃ and MAPbBr₂. ₅Cl₀. ₅ single crystal mobilities were found to be between 30 - 390 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹ and 10 - 100 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹ respectively, the diffusion lengths were found to be between 2 - 8 μm and 1 - 4 μm respectively. This is an improvement over polycrystalline thin film perovskites and comparable to other single crystal perovskites. The conductance of MAPb₁-xSnxBr₃ based perovskites was found to increase by 2 orders of magnitude even with just 1 % of Sn incorporated. The thermal conductivity of MAPbBr₃ single crystals was found to be ~ 1. 12 Wm⁻¹ K⁻¹ at room temperature which is reasonable low for single crystals, however no other thermoelectric properties could be measured due to the <b>self</b> <b>cleaving</b> nature of the single crystals with decreasing temperature and the high resistivity of the material...|$|E
40|$|Recently, STM {{measurements}} of <b>cleaved,</b> <b>self</b> assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) have provided important {{information on the}} morphology and composition of these buried semiconductor islands. It is also now becoming possible to use STM techniques to image the electronic charge density within the SAQDs. At low bias voltages, the tunnelling current measured during crosssectional scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (XSTS) experiments contains direct information on the 0 D bound electronic states of the cleaved quantum dots. In this paper we present a numerical simulation of an XSTS experiment. The calculated tunnelling currents between an STM tip and the bound states inside a physically realistic model of a cleaved SAQD are compared to experimental results and qualitative agreement is found. The calculation of the tunnelling current is split into two stages. First the bound electron states of the cleaved quantum dot are calculated by exact diagonalisation of the Hamiltonian in a simple harmonic oscillator basis set. The calculation is performed within the single-band effective mass approximation including the position dependence of the effective mass and, most crucially, {{the effect of the}} deformations of the cleaved dot structure and the strain field within the system. The strains and deformations of the heterostructure are found with a continuum, finite element model. The calculation method is completely general, however, in this paper we apply it to the InGaAs dot structure reported by Bruls et al [1]. Second, the Tersoff-Hamann approximation [2] is used to calculate the tunnelling probability between the bound electronic states and the STMtip at different tip positions and bias voltages. The calculated STM signal is compared to experimental data and reasonable agreement is obtained. The method may be used to obtain additional physical information about the buried SAQDs, for example, details on the lateral variations in the composition...|$|R
40|$|Sarah, {{currently}} aged 14 Y: 3 M, is a late {{child of}} a socially differentiated couple, who were already the parents of monozygotic female twins, aged 13 Y at the time Sarah was born. Sarah had experienced “double parenting” for years due to her twin sisters, who sequestered and took hold of her under the nonchalant and emotionally detached eyes of her biological parental couple and {{which led to the}} development of an identity based on a <b>cleaving</b> of her <b>Self,</b> often projected in repeated drawings of the ‘little mermaid’. Sarah underwent four years of psychoanalytical psychotherapy, initiated in the sequence of marked complaints concerning socialization problems with her peers and school phobia. After a one-year interruption, Sarah resumed therapy reactively electing a symptom linked to anorectic behaviours and a refusal to grow up and which concealed a means of enacting some familial power, and through rescuing her ‘lost identity’ established a place that was duly hers in the family nucleus. The ruthlessness and the obsessive nature of her anorectic behaviour, assumed as a means of control, had materialized into a vicious sadomasochist circle (she controlled herself so as to be free from control, but ended up being controlled as a result of that very self-control). Such behavior resulted in her being committed to a psychiatric institution on three separate occasions, due to manifest and already life-threatening weight loss. It was the therapist’s responsibility to rescue and preserve the healthy part of Sarah’s Self-revealed in the course of the therapy sessions, in stark opposition to the other pathological and <b>cleaved</b> <b>Self</b> that presented during her institutionalization.
