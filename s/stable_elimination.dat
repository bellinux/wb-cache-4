This fungus was isolated from a biofilter which operated with toluene {{for more than}} 6 months. The experiments were performed in a 2. 9 L reactor packed with vermiculite or with vermiculite-granular activated carbon as packing material. The initial moisture content of the support and the inlet concentration of toluene were 70 % and 6 g/m 3, respectively. As the pressure drop increased from 5 – 40 mm H 2 O a strong initial growth was observed. Stable operation was maintained for 20 days with a moisture content of 55 % and a biomass of 33 mg biomass/g dry support.

30|$|Nausea, {{vomiting}} and nasal bleeding are more frequent in patients undergoing general anesthesia than in patients undergoing local anesthesia. Sufficient bleeding and pain {{control of the}} nasal septum improves patient cooperation and patient handling and as a consequence; patient satisfaction {{at the end of}} the surgery (Fedok et al. 2000). Two commonly used drugs for patient-controlled sedation are dexmedetomidine and propofol. Dexmedetomidine is an α 2 adrenergic receptor (adrenoceptor) agonist which is used for its unique properties for sedation and analgesia during the perioperative period. Because of its potent sedative, analgesic, perioperative sympatholytic effects, reduced anesthetic demand and cardiovascular stabilizing effects, dexmedetomidine became the center of interest for many recent studies. In addition, it does not cause respiratory depression. Dexmedetomidine activates the receptors in the brain and spinal cord and causes hypotension, bradycardia, sedation and analgesia (Gertler et al. 2001 Jan). On the other hand, propofol is a short-acting anesthetic with short half-life, controllable dose–effect power and <b>stable</b> <b>elimination</b> rate. Propofol is sedative and anxiolytic in low doses but hypnotic in high doses. It has low to no amnestic effects. Depending on the dosage and the injection rate, a 15 – 25  % decrease in systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure (MAP) occurs in healthy patients, which makes it a widely preferred agent in septoplastic surgery. Nevertheless, propofol has no analgesic effect (Rajapakse et al. 2003; Köksal 2007; Janzen et al. 1999).|$|E

40|$|Patients {{with severe}} {{coagulation}} factor VIII deficiency require frequent infusions of human factor VIII (hFVIII) concentrates to treat life-threatening hemorrhages. Because these patients are immunologically hFVIII-naive, a significant treatment complication {{is the development}} of inhibitors or circulating alloantibodies against hFVIII, which bind the replaced glycoprotein, increase its plasma clearance, and inhibit its activity, preventing subsequent treatments from having a therapeutic effect. A genetic approach toward the induction of immunologic unresponsiveness to hFVIII has the conceptual advantage of a long-term, <b>stable</b> <b>elimination</b> of undesired immune responses against hFVIII. Here, we report that in a factor VIII (FVIII) -deficient mouse model for severe hemophilia A, genetic modification of donor bone marrow cells with a retroviral vector encoding hFVIII, and transplant to hemophiliac mouse recipients, results in the induction of immune tolerance to FVIII in 50 % of treated animals after immunization with hFVIII, despite the fact that hFVIII protein or activity is undetectable. In tolerized animals, the titers of anti-hFVIII binding antibodies and of hFVIII inhibitor antibodies were significantly reduced, and there was evidence for hFVIII unresponsiveness in CD 4 + T cells. Importantly, the plasma clearance of hFVIII was significantly decreased in tolerized animals and was not significantly different from that seen in a FVIII-naive hemophiliac mouse. This model system will prove useful for the evaluation of genetic therapies for hFVIII immunomodulation and bring genetic therapies for hFVIII tolerance closer to clinical application for patients with hemophilia A...|$|E

40|$|AbstractJB/RH 1 {{melanoma}} cells, as well {{as other}} melanomas of C 57 BL/ 6 mice (B 16 and JB/MS), express a common melanoma-associated antigen (MAA) encoded by an ecotropic melanoma-associated retrovirus (MelARV). JB/RH 1 cells do not express the H- 2 Kbmolecules due to down-regulation of the H- 2 Kband TAP- 1 genes. When JB/RH 1 cells were transfected with the H- 2 Kband cotransfected with the TAP- 1 gene, it resulted in the appearance of H- 2 Kbmolecules and an increase in their immunogenicity, albeit they lost expression of retrovirus-encoded MAA recognized by MM 2 - 9 B 6 mAb. Loss of MAA was found to result from a complete and <b>stable</b> <b>elimination</b> of ecotropic MelARV production in the H- 2 Kb/TAP- 1 -transfected JB/RH 1 cells. Northern blot analysis showed no differences in ecotropic retroviral messages in MelARV-producing and -nonproducing melanoma cells, suggesting that loss of MelARV production was not due to down-regulation of MelARV transcription. Southern blot analysis revealed several rearrangements in the proviral DNA of H- 2 Kb-positive JB/RH 1 melanoma cells. Sequence analysis of the ecotropic proviral DNA from these cells showed numerous nucleotide substitutions, some of which resulted in the appearance of a novel intraviralPstI restriction site and the loss of aHindIII restriction site in thepolregion. PCR amplification of the proviral DNAs indicates that an ecotropic provirus found in the H- 2 Kb-positive cells is novel and does not preexist in the parental H- 2 Kb-negative melanoma cells. Conversely, the ecotropic provirus of the parental JB/RH 1 cells was not amplifable from the H- 2 Kb-positive cells. Our data indicate that stable loss of retroviral production in the H- 2 Kb/TAP- 1 -transfected melanoma cells is probably due to the induction of recombination between a productive ecotropic MelARV and a defective nonecotropic provirus leading to the generation of a defective ecotropic provirus and the loss of MelARV production and expression of the retrovirus-encoded MAA...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In acute lung injury (ALI) {{mechanical}} ventilation damages lungs. We hypothesised that aspiration and replacement of dead space during expiration (ASPIDS) allows normocapnic ventilation at higher end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and reduced tidal volume (V(T)), peak and plateau pressures (Paw(peak), Paw(plat)), thus avoiding lung damage. SETTING: University Hospital. PATIENTS: Seven consecutive sedated and paralysed ALI patients were studied. Interventions and measurements: Single breath test for CO(2) and multiple elastic pressure volume (Pel/V) curves recorded from different end-expiratory pressures guided ventilatory setting at ASPIDS. ASPIDS was studied at respiratory rate (RR) of 14 min(- 1) and then 20 min(- 1) with minute ventilation maintaining <b>stable</b> CO(2) <b>elimination.</b> RESULTS: Alveolar and airway dead spaces were 24. 3 % and 31. 3 % of V(T), respectively. Multiple Pel/V curves showed a shift towards lower volume at decreasing PEEP, thus indicating that patients required a higher PEEP. At ASPIDS, PEEP was increased from 8. 9 cmH(2) O to 12. 6 cmH(2) O and VT reduced from 11 ml/kg to 8. 9 ml/kg at RR 14 min(- 1) and to 6. 9 ml/kg at RR 20 min(- 1). A {{significant decrease in}} Paw(peak) (36. 7 vs 32 at RR 14 min(- 1) and 28. 7 at RR 20 min(- 1)) and Paw(plat) (29. 9 vs 27. 3 at RR 14 min- 1 and 24. 1 at RR 20 min- 1) were observed.

The concept differs from the swashplate designs in conventional helicopter flight controls and enables a helicopter to be passively <b>stable</b> in hover. <b>Elimination</b> of the conventional cyclic and collective pitch controls allows for simpler and lighter helicopters to be developed. A helicopter based on this design achieves stability {{without the use of}} gyroscopes or any form of active stabilization and thus is made up of much fewer parts than other model helicopters. The two counter-rotating rotors keep the helicopter very stable relative to the surrounding air. Altitude control is performed by varying the speed for both main rotors while Yaw control is achieved by increasing the speed of one rotor and reducing the speed of the other rotor by the same amount. A horizontally oriented tail rotor controls the helicopter’s forward or backward movement by shifting its center of lift with respect to the center of gravity (CG).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the results obtained}} from two projects in organosulfur chemistry; both of which involve the use of sulfonylammonium ions. The two projects undertaken involved sulfenes and 3 -alkoxysulfonyl trialkylpropanaminium salts (2 ̆ 2 lcub 3 rcubbetylates 2 ̆ 2).;The first project describes efforts undertaken to delineate more precisely the reaction mechanisms of sulfenes, a highly reactive species. The reaction mechanism of sulfene was studied by allowing multiexchange to occur with deuterated traps. Methanol-d {{was used as the}} trapping agent in benzene-acetonitrile and deuterium oxide as the trap in a buffered deuterium oxide-dimethoxyethane system. The investigations made use of methanesulfonyl chloride and a series of trialkyl(methylsulfonyl) ammonium fluorosulfate salts as starting materials. The multiexchange results were used to deduce aspects of the mechanism. The results obtained showed that nucleophilic catalysis was not a significant path for formation of sulfene from sulfonyl chlorides when triethylamine was used to promote sulfene formation cut that less hindered amines may react with methane sulfonyl chloride via nucleophilic catalysis to some extent.;The second project involves the synthesis and reactions of lcub 3 rcubBetylates(3 -(Alkoxysulfonyl) propanaminium salts). lcub 3 rcubBetylates are an example of a new type of substrate for aliphatic nucleophilic substitution which enhance the applicability of nucleophilic substitution reactions to problems in organic synthesis by providing a good nucleofuge and phase transfer reagent in one substrate.

40|$|Background Simulium damnosum s. l., {{the most}} {{important}} vector of onchocerciasis in Africa, is a complex of sibling species that have been described {{on the basis of}} differences in their larval polytene chromosomes. These (cyto) species differ in their geographical distributions, ecologies and epidemiological roles. In Ghana, distributional changes have been recorded as a consequence of vector control and environmental change (e. g. deforestation), with potential disease consequences. We review the distribution of cytospecies in southern Ghana and report changes observed with reference to historical data collated from 1971 to 2005 and new identifications made between 2006 and 2011. Methods/Results Larvae were collected from riverine breeding sites, fixed in Carnoy’s solution and chromosome preparations made. Cytotaxonomic identifications from 1, 232 samples (including 49 new samples) were analysed. We report long-term stability in cytospecies distribution in the rivers Afram, Akrum, Pawnpawn and Pru. For the rivers Oda, Ofin and Tano we describe (for the first time) patterns of distribution. We could not detect cytospecies composition changes in the upper Pra, and the lower Pra seems to have been <b>stable.</b> The <b>elimination</b> of the Djodji form of S. [*]sanctipauli in the Volta Region seems to have had no long-term effects on the distribution of the other cytospecies, despite an initial surge by S. [*]yahense. There has been a recent increase in the occurrence of savannah cytospecies in the river Asukawkaw, and this might be related to continuing deforestation. Conclusions Cytospecies’ distributions have not been stable from 1971 to 2011. Although there are no obvious causes for the temporary appearance and subsequent disappearance of cytospecies in a particular location, a major influence has been vector control and migration patterns, probably explaining observed changes on the Black Volta and lower Volta rivers. Deforestation was previously implicated in an increase of savannah cytospecies in southern Ghana (1975 – 1997). Our data had little power to support (or refute) suggestions of a continuing increase, except in the Asukawkaw river basin...|$|R

Thus far, however, no clinical studies have taken advantage of their specific immunosuppressive potential. Tolerogenic DCs may represent a new therapeutic strategy for human immune-based diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, where the perturbations of the finely tuned balance between the immune system and the microflora result in disease. In the present report, we describe the generation of tolerogenic DCs from healthy donors and Crohn’s disease patients using clinical-grade reagents in combination with dexamethasone as immunosuppressive agent and characterize their response to maturation stimuli. Interestingly, we found out that dexamethasone-conditioned DCs keep their tolerogenic properties to Gram-negative bacteria. Other findings included in this study demonstrate that the combination of dexamethasone with a specific cytokine cocktail yielded clinical-grade DCs with the following characteristics: a semi-mature phenotype, a pronounced shift towards anti-inflammatory versus inflammatory cytokine production and low T-cell stimulatory properties.

Benzotriazoles are preparatively useful precursors of cyanocyclopentadienes, carbazoles, and aza-analogues. FVP of 5 -aryltetrazoles can result in double N elimination with formation of arylcarbenes or of heteroarylcarbenes, which again rearrange to arylnitrenes.

Our extensive numerical experiments show that the new factorization scheme is as numerically stable as GEPP in practice, but it is more resistant to pathological cases and easily solves the Wilkinson matrix and the Foster matrix. The LU PRRP factorization does only O(n 2 b) additional floating point operations compared to GEPP. We also present CALU PRRP, a communication avoiding version of LU PRRP that minimizes communication. CALU PRRP is based on tournament pivoting, with the selection of the pivots at each step of the tournament being performed via strong rank revealing QR factorization. CALU PRRP is more stable than CALU, the communication avoiding version of GEPP, with a theoretical upper bound of the growth factor of (1 + τb) n b (H+ 1) − 1, where b is the size of the panel used during the factorization, τ is a parameter of the strong rank revealing QR factorization, n is the number of columns of the matrix, and H is the height of the reduction tree used during tournament pivoting. The upper bound of the growth factor of CALU is 2 n(H+ 1) − 1. CALU PRRP is also more stable in practice and is resistant to pathological cases on which GEPP and CALU fail...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe present block LU {{factorization}} with panel rank revealing pivoting (block LU PRRP), a decomposition algorithm {{based on}} strong rank revealing QR panel factorization. Block LU PRRP is more <b>stable</b> than Gaussian <b>elimination</b> with partial pivoting (GEPP), with a theoretical upper bound {{of the growth}} factor of (1 + τb) (n/b) − 1, where b {{is the size of}} the panel used during the block factorization, τ is a parameter of the strong rank revealing QR factorization, n is the number of columns of the matrix, and for simplicity we assume that n is a multiple of b. We also assume throughout the paper that 2 ≤ b n. For example, if the size of the panel is b = 64, and τ = 2, then (1 + 2 b) (n/b) − 1 = (1. 079) n− 64 2 n− 1, where 2 n− 1 is the upper bound of the growth factor of GEPP.

40|$|Abstract Group 10 Methyl Transfer Reactions toward Catalyst Development for Oxidative Oligomerization of Methane by Matthew Sean Remy Chair: Melanie S. Sanford One of the {{challenges}} of developing a homogeneous catalyst for oxidative oligomerization of methane (OOM) is promoting a C–C coupling reaction from the product of alkane C–H activation. Heterolytic C–H activation of methane almost exclusively generates a monoalkyl-metal species. In {{order to make a}} new C–C bond, it is proposed that a polymethyl intermediate must be generated. Our studies showed that aryl disproportionation is far more favorable than methyl disproportionation. Careful tuning of ancillary ligands at monomethyl-palladium(II) complexes using density functional theory (DFT) calculations facilitated optimization of thermodynamics for methyl disproportionation. This allowed the first observed disproportionation reaction to form a dimethyl-palladium(II) complex. Heating dimethyl complex (tBu-bpy) PdII(CH 3) 2 (tBu-bpy = 4, 4 -ditertbutyl- 2, 2 -bipyridine) to 100 °C produced a mixture of methane and ethane over 24 h. One-electron oxidants and 1, 4 -benzoquinone were found to be effective promoters of ethane formation from (tBu-bpy) PdII(CH 3) 2 at 25 °C. Mechanistic study of one-electron oxidation uncovered an oxidatively-induced methyl transfer reaction which produced ethane from [(tBu-bpy) PdIV(CH 3) 3 (solvent) ]+. Subsequently, one-electron oxidation of complexes of the general formula (tBu-bpy) PdII(CH 3) X was developed as an effective method for generation of ethane from monomethyl-palladium(II) complexes. Platinum complexes, (N–N) PtII(CH 3) 2, similarly undergo one-electron to produce [(N–N) PtIV(CH 3) 3 (solvent) ]+. However, these platinum(IV) products are generally <b>stable</b> to reductive <b>elimination</b> of ethane. When the N–N ligand is designed to have steric interactions with axial ligands of platinum(IV), ethane reductive elimination becomes favorable, occurring cleanly over 8. 5 hours in acetone and over 1 h in dichloromethane. This document describes experimental evidence for the generation of polymethyl palladium and platinum complexes from model palladium(II) and platinum(II) products of C–H activation subsequent ethane elimination from the polymethyl complexes. In an unrelated project, N-insertion into palladium-carbon bond was observed when palladium(II) complexes of bidentate C–N ligands were reacted with an iminoiodinane oxidant. The reaction was proposed to occur through an imido-palladium(IV) intermediate...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The {{effect of}} scale is an {{important}} concern in mapping of biodiversity. Scale issues include the grid cell size used for analysis {{and the effect of}} the extent and internal boundaries. Because biodiversity analysis involves combinatorial processes, determining the proper scale is data dependent and cannot be predicted from the initial data values and their distribution. Biodiversity analysis often samples combinations of species within geopolitical boundaries. The effects of ecoregion boundaries on prioritization analysis was analyzed in two ways. This study determined that prioritization hexagons for Oregon do not fall preferentially on ecoregion boundaries. This research also concluded that results of prioritization analysis are geographically <b>stable</b> with the <b>elimination</b> of hexagons on ecoregion boundaries from analysis. Species maps based on the Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) grid were analyzed. Grid cells 7 times as large result in species richness maps statistically similar to maps made with the EMAP grid. Patterns of localized variation between grid cells indicate no one area is contributing to the overall variation. Prioritization maps, however, show different patterns of selected hexagons. Grid cells 49 times as large show a loss of species richness variation and a different pattern of prioritization hexagons. Richness maps based on wildlife habitat relations were used to map species richness at seven different three-fold compositions and decompositions of the EMAP grid. Analysis of statistics indicates that no scale shows a small relative decrease in coefficient of variation(CV), indicating no scale is relatively superior for richness mapping. Prioritization analysis was performed on the new combinations of species lists for five grid cell sizes ranging from 1 / 9 to 9 X's the size of the EMAP grid. Efficiency of prioritization and map patterns of prioritization areas indicate that grid cells 1 / 3 the size of the EMAP hexagons are optimal. Comparisons can be made between the two biodiversity analyses at the EMAP scale for wildlife habitat vs. EMAP grid based species range maps. CV values have increased and the efficiency of prioritization is enhanced. This can be attributed to finer resolution sampling capturing additional information...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} loss of apparent cohesion from rainwater infiltration upon the stability of partly saturated, allophanic soil slopes of Dominica (West Indies). The parent material of the Dominican allophanic soils are the andesitic and dacitic volcanic rocks from ten volcanic centres of mainly Pleistocene age. Although simplifying assumptions are made to assess the depth of wetting front and magnitudes of true and apparent cohesion values of the partly saturated allophanic soils, certain inferences of practical significance emerge from the study. Matric suction contributes to the effective stress of unsaturated soils and increases the shear strength of these soils by imparting them an apparent cohesion strength component. This apparent cohesion strength component of the partly saturated Dominican allophanic soils {{is considered to be}} related to the matric suction term (u(a) -u(w)) by a parabolic relationship. The partly saturated allophanic soil slopes of Dominica would invariably fail from loss of apparent cohesion upon saturation of the soil mantle by the infiltrating water front only if (a) the average slope angle (beta) is greater than or equal to the drained shear strength parameter of the unsaturated soil (phi(d)) (slopes with beta greater than or equal to phi(d) are referred to as category 1 slopes in this study) and (b) the drained cohesion parameter (c(d)) belonging to the partly saturated soil of the category 1 slope is mainly contributed by matric suction induced apparent cohesion (c(app)) and contribution from true cohesion (c') is absent. However, the possibility of the category 1 slopes (for the case 1 situation) failing in the saturated condition from effective stress reduction due to rise in ground water table is shown to be an unfeasible proposition. In contrast, for the case 1 situation, the partly saturated category 2 slopes (beta<phi(d)) are insusceptible to failure from reduction in effective stress due to loss of matric suction but fail in the saturated condition from effective stress reduction due to rise in ground water table. If the allophanic soils were to possess a sufficient magnitude of true cohesion (c'), even the partly saturated category 1 slopes possessing slope angles (beta) much in excess of their phi(d) values (beta-phi(d) = 15. 1 degrees) would remain <b>stable</b> upon total <b>elimination</b> of the matric suction induced cohesion. However, partly saturated category 1 slopes possessing a true cohesion component and insusceptible to failure from reduction in effective stress upon loss of matric suction, invariably fail in the saturated condition from reduction in effective stress due to rise in ground water table. Using the methodology developed in this study, two previously reported case histories pertaining to rain induced translational landslides in the residual soil areas of Brazil are re-examined and the results obtained in this study are found to be in agreement with the findings of the previous researchers...|$|R
