40|$|Many mobile {{devices have}} touch-sensitive screens that people {{interact}} with using fingers or thumbs. However, such interaction {{is difficult because}} targets become occluded, and because fingers and thumbs have low input resolution. Recent research has addressed occlusion through visual techniques. However, the poor resolution of finger and thumb selection still limits selection speed. In this paper, we address the selection speed problem through a new target selection technique called Escape. In Escape, targets are selected by gestures cued by icon position and appearance. A user study shows that for targets six to twelve pixels wide, Escape performs at a similar error rate and at least 30 % faster than Shift, an alternative technique, on a similar task. We evaluate Escape’s performance in different circumstances, including different icon sizes, icon overlap, use of color, and gesture direction. We also describe an algorithm that assigns icons to targets, thereby improving Escape’s performance. Author Keywords Target <b>selection,</b> <b>finger</b> gesture, touch screen, mobile devic...|$|E

40|$|Motor {{response}} {{selection is}} {{the process by which}} an intention to act is transformed into an action; this multifaceted process occurs at the interface between cognitive and motor systems. Despite the importance of response selection, the nature and neural implementation of this process is still a subject of debate (Thompson-Schill et al, 1997; Botvinick et al., 2001; Rushworth et al., 2004; Nachev et al., 2007). While previous research has demonstrated that the <b>selection</b> of <b>finger</b> movements relies on a distributed network involving premotor and prefrontal areas, the specific contribution of these regions, however, remains unclear. It is also unclear if the selection of words engages similar processes as the <b>selection</b> of <b>finger</b> movements, that is, if response selection is a domain-general or a domain-specific process. In order to address these issues, a set of four complementary studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was developed in which different factors affecting response selection were examined: selection mode, response type (words vs. oral movements), attention and response competition (conflict). The results of these studies provide new insights into the neural architecture of response selection by uncovering the respective contribution of premotor areas (pre-SMA and PMA) and prefrontal areas (DLPFC and IFG). A preliminary two-stage model of response selection is proposed, in which the PMA is generating a set of response alternatives from which the pre-SMA performs selection using one of two different mechanisms (response facilitation and response inhibition). In general, these findings do not support the hypothesis of a medio-lateral gradient of control (Goldberg, 1985) but confirm the fundamental role of the lateral (PMA) and medial (pre-SMA) premotor areas in the process of selecting motor responses. Importantly, the results also demonstrate that selection is a domain-general (response-independent) process. Uncovering the general, multifaceted nature of brain mechanisms is essential to reveal the basic units of control in the central nervous system; this knowledge is fundamental to broaden current understanding of the basic brain operations that are used to produce language.

We manipulated the spatial separation between adjacent fingers; that is, {{thumb and index finger}} where either close, far apart or touching. Participants directed their attention to either the index finger or thumb to detect infrequent tactile targets at that location while they either saw their fingers or these were covered from view.

This paper presents an approach to relax the requirement on routing tables to provide provably better stability than fixed structured P 2 P systems. We propose a relaxed Chord that keeps the O(logN) number of hops for greedy lookup, but it requires less stabilization overhead. It allows a tradeoff between lookup efficiency and structure flexibility without adding any overhead to the system. In the relaxed routing structure, each routing entry ("finger") of the node is allowed to vary within a set of values. Each node only needs to keep a certain number of fingers that point to nodes in its anchor set. This relaxation reduces the burden of state management of the node. The relaxed routing scheme provides an alternative structure other than randomized P 2 P and deterministic P 2 P, by relaxing on <b>finger</b> <b>selection.</b> It provides good flexibility and therefore extends the system functioning time.

Right-hemisphere dominance was present at the occipital extension of posterior IPS. Positioning one right-hand finger of five on the middle target dot was related with anterior IPS activation, extending over the marginal gyrus of the left inferior parietal lobe. The latter indicated a parietal role in prehension, independent of the shape of the target reached for.

Free selection was button based (target based) or finger based (self-referenced), with invariant instructions as control. To avoid a visual attention bias, instructions were auditory presented. Statistical parametric mapping revealed that free button selection with the same finger was associated with increased activations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right posterodorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC) including the rostral extension of the dorsal premotor cortex (pre-PMd), and the anterodorsal PFC. Prefrontal activation related to free <b>finger</b> <b>selection</b> (pressing the same button) was restricted to an anteromedial segment of the posterodorsal PFC/pre-PMd.

Carefully determining the role of boundary geometry, we construct field equations of motion, these central to the analytic power we can here exercise. We consider an explicit analytic class of maps to the physical space, a basis of solutions for infinite fluid in an infinitely long channel, characterized by meromorphic derivatives. We verify that these maps never lose analyticity {{in the course of}} temporal evolution, thus justifying the underlying machinery. However, the great bulk of these solutions can lose conformality in time, this the circumstance of finite-time singularities. By considerations {{of the nature of the}} analyticity of all these solutions, we show that those free of such singularities inevitably result in a single asymptotic "finger". This is purely nonlinear behavior: the very early "finger" actually already has a waist, this having signalled the end of any linear regime. The single "finger" has nevertheless an arbitrary width determined by initial conditions. This is in contradiction with the experimental results that indicate <b>selection</b> of a <b>finger</b> of width 1 / 2. In the last part of this paper we motivate that such a solution can be determined by the boundary conditions when the fluid is finite. This is a strong signal that finiteness is determinative of pattern selection. Comment: J. Stat. Phys, submitted. RevTex, 16 pages, 4 figures include...|$|R
