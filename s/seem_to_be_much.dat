Mrs. Rogers is at the White Mountains. I am going to Fairhaven this afternoon. I hope you will not be there. By the way, I have been using a pair of your gloves in the Mountains, and they don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> of an attraction.|$|E
25|$|Some open {{clusters}} contain hot blue stars which <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> {{younger than}} the rest of the cluster. These blue stragglers are also observed in globular clusters, and in the very dense cores of globulars they are believed to arise when stars collide, forming a much hotter, more massive star. However, the stellar density in open clusters is much lower than that in globular clusters, and stellar collisions cannot explain the numbers of blue stragglers observed. Instead, it is thought that most of them probably originate when dynamical interactions with other stars cause a binary system to coalesce into one star.|$|E
25|$|Growth of {{the water}} {{hyacinth}} in Lake Victoria has been tracked since 1993, reaching its maxima biomass in 1997 and then declining again {{by the end of}} 2001. Greater growth was observed {{in the northern part of}} the lake, in relatively protected areas, which may be linked to current and weather patterns and could also be due to the climate and water conditions, which are more suitable to the plants growth (as there are large urban areas to the north end of the lake, in Uganda). The invasive weed was first attempted to be controlled by hand, removed manually from the lake; however, re-growth occurred quickly. Public awareness exercises were also conducted. More recently, measures have been used such as the introduction of natural insect predators, including two different water hyacinth weevils and large harvesting and chopping boats, which <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more effective in eliminating the water hyacinth.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{have given}} [...] "Pokey Mom" [...] {{generally}} negative reviews. Nancy Basile of About.com said she [...] "loathed" [...] it. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that [...] "Other than a nice guest turn from Michael Keaton, 'Mom' doesn’t {{do much to}} {{stand out from the}} crowd. Oh, like much of Season 12, it keeps us interested, but that’s not exactly a strong endorsement. 'Mom' provides a watchable show but nothing more." [...] Den of Geek critic Matt Haigh wrote that the episode [...] "starts well, but begins to feel tired and drawn out, and there just doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> of a story there." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Preggers" [...] was {{watched by}} 6.64million United States viewers and {{attained}} a 3.1/8 rating/share in the 18-49 demographic. It was the twenty-second most watched show in Canada {{for the week}} of broadcast, with 1.39million viewers. In the UK, the episode was watched by 1.804million viewers (1.397million on E4, and 407,000 on timeshift), becoming the most-watched show on E4 and E4+1 for the week, and the most-watched show on cable for the week, {{as well as the}} most watched episode of the series at the time. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Shawna Malcom for the Los Angeles Times reviewed the episode positively, praising the football team's performance of the [...] "Single Ladies" [...] dance and Kurt coming out to his father. Malcom also commented positively on the show's fast pacing; however, Mike Hale of the New York Post was less favorable, deeming the episode [...] "overstuffed with story lines". He felt that key characters did not receive enough screentime, and that: [...] "There was so much exposition going on that there didn’t <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> room for laughs." ...|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{never saw}} himself as a science-fiction writer, and was often {{critical}} of the genre. He particularly disliked the BBC series Doctor Who (1963–89; 1996; 2005–present), {{for which he had}} once turned down an offer to write. [...] "It sounded a terrible idea and I still think it was," [...] he commented in 1986. [...] "The fact that it's lasted a long time and has a steady audience doesn't mean much. So has Crossroads and that's a stinker". He also slammed Blake's 7, which he described as the lowest point of British television science-fiction: [...] "I think the low point for me would be the very few bits I've seen of a thing called Blake's 7 which I found paralytically awful. The dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling" [...] and Doomwatch: [...] "I was approached to write Doomwatch. That didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> good either." [...] Doctor Who was heavily influenced by Kneale's Quatermass serials, in some cases even using specific storylines that were very similar to those from Quatermass.|$|E

500|$|Panjaa {{received}} largely {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The movie was criticised for {{its lack of}} story and weak screenplay, though it was praised for its stylish presentation. Rediff gave a two stars, said [...] "Panjaa is let down by a weak script. Panjaa also reminds one of Pawan Kalyan's own earlier movie, Balu. The {{second half of the}} film lags a bit. There doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> originality in the story telling. On the whole, Panjaa is nothing extraordinary and even a bit disappointing". [...] rated two stars, noted [...] "The main drop down in the film is Pawan's character design. His getup and being a yesman to a gangster aren't in kilter with his nursery business. First half is morose and second half is emotion overdose. On a whole, Panjaa hits badly on the expectations of audience". Deccan Chronicle gave two stars says [...] "The much-hyped action thriller lacks the adrenaline of a tight and creative script and one feels let down when stepping out of the theatre". A gangster film with mafia backdrop, It got mixed reviews but its title song, Panjaa, was the song of the year.|$|E
2500|$|In 1931, Carothers {{moved into}} a house in Wilmington, which became known as Whiskey Acres, with three other DuPont scientists. He was no recluse, but his {{depressive}} moods often prevented him from enjoying all the activities in which his roommates took part. In {{a letter to a}} close friend, Frances Spencer, he said, [...] "There doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> to report concerning my experiences outside of chemistry. I'm living out in the country now with three other bachelors, and they being socially inclined have all gone out in tall hats and white ties, while I after my ancient custom sit sullenly at home." [...] At about this time, Carothers showed Julian Hill that he kept a capsule of cyanide attached to his watch chain.|$|E
2500|$|Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone criticized Jones' performance, stating, Jones [...] "plays Danny {{as a case}} of {{a secret}} {{identity}} that might be just [...] well disguised – because he's so totally devoid of charisma, more cub than lone wolf. With his scruffy beard and dazed [...] "who, me?" [...] eyes, Jones {{could be one of the}} twinkling boy-men who populated Hollywood comedies a decade ago, except now the party's over and he can't understand why bad hombres keep trying to kill him... Iron Fist has no humor either, so it ends up just looking like a superhero drama where they forgot to invite the superhero.... Iron Fists hero can't seem to muster any inner turmoil beyond the occasional harshed vibe. There doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> of anything going on his skull. His mystic Zen quotes go over like a Wayne's World set-up minus the punch line." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jarrett {{played his}} first {{international}} for Wales on 15 April 1967 against England, aged eighteen years. [...] He {{had been selected}} at full back {{even though he had}} never played senior rugby in that position. [...] Newport were asked to play him at full back against Newbridge on the weekend before the international to give him some experience. [...] He did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> of a success in his new position and at half time, his captain David Watkins, switched him to centre. The following week Jarrett played in his first international and scored a breathtaking try. [...] England won a line-out in their own 25 (as it was then). [...] The ball was passed down the line to English centre, Colin McFadyean, who kicked towards the halfway line. [...] The ball bounced once and was seemingly going in to touch. [...] Instead, Jarret sprinted onto the ball, taking it without breaking stride. He sprinted down the touchline, outflanking the whole of the astonished England defence, to score in the left corner. [...] He converted his own try from just inside the touchline. Besides scoring a try, he kicked two penalty goals and five conversions for a total of 19 points. [...] His performance on the field was so impressive that the match has been known ever since as the Keith Jarrett match and he made the cover of Rugby World magazine two months later. The try has been voted seventh in a poll of the top ten Welsh tries and he is listed on the Welsh Rugby Union Official Website as the scorer of the [...] "Greatest Ever Welsh try".|$|E
2500|$|Attenborough {{starts the}} second {{programme}} {{by looking at}} potential future events, before warning that what happens {{over the next few}} years is crucial. A BBC weather forecast for the year 2050 shows that summer temperatures of 38°C for the UK are [...] "par for the course". The probable range by which the planet will warm over the next century is between 1.4°C and 5.8°C. Or, says Attenborough, [...] "to put it another way, the impact of global warming will be somewhere between severe and catastrophic." [...] The naturalist is invited to watch a film that illustrates regional change over the next 100 years. A 2°C rise for the south of England, for example, may not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> but that is not all there is to it. Rainfall is also predicted to be more intense and storms could be five times more frequent than they are at the moment. This makes extreme events, such as the 2004 Boscastle flood, much more likely. Current defences for severe wind or rain will shortly become inadequate. Even Hurricane Katrina, with the devastation it caused, is described as [...] "not particularly powerful". In Australia, a new approach is needed to combat brush fires after the hottest year on record. If the Amazon tropical rainforest were to disappear, not only would an entire ecosystem vanish, but a valuable way of cooling the planet would go as well. Meanwhile, the glaciers continue to melt: one scientist reveals that an area the size of Texas has been lost over the last 20 years. Attenborough is told that a warming of 2°C is inevitable, as a consequence of our actions over the last 25 years, but whether or not we end up at 6°C is still very much within our control.|$|E
