40|$|The paper aims {{to develop}} a {{specific}} approach to the conservation of the private spaces of the University Colleges in Urbino, designed by Giancarlo De Carlo. This contribution argues that {{a new approach to}} the conservation should be advisable. Since the Colleges <b>cannot</b> <b>stop</b> <b>working</b> as accommodation for students, students themselves should be the protagonists of the conservation of these environments. After a first phase of analysis of the conservation degree of the indoor spaces and the furnishings, the research project came to define a management path for the usual maintenance and right conservation of the indoor. The elaboration of a geodatabase allowed organizing the data in relation to the objects’ location within the whole complex, thus enabling the cataloguing of the various degradation’s typologies hitherto impossible. In this way, a precise picture of the conservation state had been drawn, easy to access and consult for the person in charge of the maintenance and conservation. The ultimate goal of the project is to grant that the furnishings and the environment they were designed for continue to be used by the constantly changing people of students. For this reason, the students’ engagement in the care process is the starting point to make the conservation sustainable. As it is impossible to stop the daily activity of Colleges for conservative reasons, a new approach to ordinary maintenance is advisable, open source and participative...|$|R
