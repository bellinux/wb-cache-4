5|$|Individual owners took {{advantage}} of the AmeriKing failure; one of the BK regional owners, Miami-based Al Cabrera, purchased 130 stores located primarily in the Chicago and the upper mid-west, from the failed company for a bargain basement price of $16million, or approximately 88 percent of their original value.

5|$|Since {{the station}} started construction, land {{prices in the}} {{immediate}} area have nearly doubled.
