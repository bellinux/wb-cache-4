40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the benefits of}} text and <b>symbolic</b> <b>displays</b> in highway signs relative to their familiarity on their comprehension speed and accuracy. Background: A recent study that evaluated the influence of ergonomic principles - familiarity, standardization, and symbol-concept compatibility - on traffic sign comprehension showed that comprehension is highly correlated with the compliance with these ergonomic design principles (Ben-Bassat & Shinar, 2006). As an alternative to existing unfamiliar symbolic signs we tested {{the effect of adding}} text. Method: Drivers were presented with 30 traffic signs varying in their level of familiarity in three display conditions: standard symbol-only, text-only, and symbol + text. Speed and accuracy of comprehension were recorded. Results: Display condition and familiarity significantly affected both correctness of the answers and reaction time. Correctness improved when the symbol was shown with text, especially when the sign was less familiar. Conclusions: Adding text improves the comprehension and reduces {{the time it takes to}} comprehend the sign, especially of unfamiliar signs. Application: Adding text could be a simple solution to making (unfamiliar) signs more understandable to a greater segment of the driving population without compromising comprehension time, thereby increasing traffic safety.

40|$|Experiences raise {{a number}} of {{concerns}} for future spatial-display developers. While the promise of spatial displays is great, {{the cost of their}} development will be correspondingly large. The knowledge and skills which must be coordinated to ensure successful results is unprecedent. From the viewpoint of the designer, basic knowledge of how human beings perceive and process complex displays appears fragmented and largely unquantified. Methodologies for display development require prototyping and testing with subject pilots for even small changes. Useful characterizations of the range of differences between individual users is nonexistent or at best poorly understood. The nature, significance, and frequency of interpretation errors associated with complex integrated displays is unexplored and undocumented territory. Graphic displays have intuitive appeal and can achieve face validity much more readily than earlier <b>symbolic</b> <b>displays.</b> The risk of misleading the pilot is correspondingly greater. Thus while some in the research community are developing the tools and techniques necessary for effective spatial-display development, potential users must be educated about the issues so that informed choices can be made. The scope of the task facing all is great. The task is challenging and the potential for meaningful contributions at all levels is high indeed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{interactive}} multiobjective optimization systems, {{the classification}} of objec-tive functions is a convenient way {{to search for the}} best possible compromise solution. In classification, the user specifies what kind of changes of objective function values (in relation to the current values) would be desirable. However, {{it is not clear how}} the classi-fication should be implemented to serve the user in the best possible way. The uppermost goal of developing the usability of such systems is to support users during the classification process as well as possible. We wanted to study the interactive multiobjective optimization system WWW-NIMBUS and especially the usability of graphic and <b>symbolic</b> <b>displays,</b> its classifying options. In particular, we wanted to clarify the differences between the options. Furthermore, we wanted to gather information about the difficulties that users might have. We carried out experiments where subjects solved multiobjective optimization problems with WWW-NIMBUS using both the symbolic and the graphic displays to classify the objective functions. Thus, we obtained important information about how people use the classification options and how the options could be improved. Here we summarize our findings and also present some suggestions for developing WWW-NIMBUS further. 1 Katja Kaario, Kaisa Miettinen, Marko M. Mäkela ̈ and Pertti Saariluom...|$|R

The present line of research taps the existing basic perceptual and cognitive knowledge base to propose a method of multivariate data display. The concept of a pseudo-integral, task relevant multidimensional symbol is proposed and tested. Three experiments were performed to determine {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed multidimensional symbols, as compared with a textual representation in an identification task and a visual search task. One of the primary questions concerned the information carrying potential of a single multidimensional symbol. The experiments revealed that when trained subjects performed identification and search tasks, performance continued to show improvement as the symbol approached five informational dimensions (each representing binary values). In fact, performance with complex <b>symbolic</b> <b>displays</b> was significantly better than performance with complex textual displays. When, however, three of the five informational dimensions were expanded to include a possible range of four values instead of two, performance deteriorated and was inferior to performance with textual displays.

5000|$|Indigenous slavery prior {{contact with}} Europeans {{took the form}} of captivity raids on enemy {{territory}} with an objective to kill or capture members of the enemy nation — usually men were killed, while women and children were taken captive. Among the Northeastern communities, the death of a kin member decreased the spiritual power of the community. In order to reestablish spiritual balance, members of enemy nations would be taken captive, then either killed or adopted and made slaves. Captives who escaped death but were not adopted into their captors’ community, were then used as instruments of diplomacy. [...] In contrast to European slavery, the Indigenous practice focused more on the act of enslavement itself than on the production of commodities. In Bonds of Alliance, historian Brett Rushforth argues that Indigenous slavery was: “at its heart a system of symbiotic dominion, appropriating the power and productivity of enemies and facilitating the creation of friendships built on shared animosity toward the captive’s people". [...] Thus, Indigenous slavery was part of a much larger social phenomena that focused more on the <b>symbolic</b> <b>display</b> of power and the building of alliances, than on the economic value of the labour.|$|E
40|$|Summary: GECA is a fast, {{user-friendly}} and freely-available {{tool for}} representing gene exon/intron organization and highlighting changes in gene structure {{among members of}} a gene family. It relies on pro-tein alignment, completed with the identification of common introns in the corresponding genes using CIWOG. GECA produces a main graphical representation showing the resulting aligned set of gene structures, where exons are to scale. The important and original feature of GECA is that it combines these gene structures with a <b>symbolic</b> <b>display</b> highlighting sequence similarity between subse-quent genes. It {{is worth noting that}} this combination of gene struc-ture with the indications of similarities between related genes allows rapid identification of possible events of gain or loss of introns, or points to erroneous structural annotations. The output image is gen-erated in a portable network graphics format which can be used for scientific publications.

40|$|Vetranović’s poem {{shows the}} wanderings {{of the main}} hero through a mysterious forest which he doesn’t know, not to mention its {{topography}} or laws.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of broad rural support in West Bengal for the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) is here studied through the history (1960 to present) of two villages in Burdwan district. The {{focus is on}} the relationship between the dynamics of village politics and political and ideological changes of the larger polity. Village politics constitutes an important realm of informal rules for political action and public participation where popular perceptions of wider political events and cultural changes are created. The communist mobilization of the late 1960 s followed from an informal alliance formed between sections of the educated (and politicized) middle-class peasantry and certain groups (castes) of poor. The middle-class peasantry drew inspiration from Bengal's high-status and literary but radicalized tradition. However, the establishment and dynamics of the alliance, at the local level, can only be understood within the normative framework of the village. The poor appeared previously as marginal to public exercise of village affairs, but were nonetheless able to manipulate resources available to them (numbers, assertion, norms) and thus achieve some leverage vis-a-vis village leaders dependent on man-support or "moral economy" sentiments for legitimacy. The interests of these groups of poor, particularly of the social or cultural kind since the material resources available were very limited, became crucial in the bonds village leaders sought to create to retain their support. Following on this practice, also the CPM's local party leadership, in the 1980 s and 1990 s, consistently confirmed social aspirations and status considerations. This leads to the conclusions that not only do communist movements too depend on considerations of social status, honours, and <b>symbolic</b> <b>displays</b> of respect but that the scope for change {{and the manner in which}} the communist movement can function at the local level derive from popular perceptions, formed and enacted in villages...|$|R

40|$|In a {{world in}} which media images of crime and {{deviance}} proliferate, where every facet of offending is reflected in a 'vast hall of mirrors', Framing Crime: Cultural Criminology and the Image makes sense of the increasingly blurred line between the real and the virtual. Images of crime and crime control have become almost as 'real' as crime and criminal justice itself. The meaning of both crime and crime control now resides, not solely in the essential - and essentially false - factuality of crime rates or arrest records, but also in the contested processes of <b>symbolic</b> <b>display,</b> cultural interpretation, and representational negotiation. It is essential, then, that criminologists are closely attuned to the various ways in which crime is imagined, constructed and framed within modern society.

Family and personal cookbooks are argued to describe not only how to create foods but also tell important identity stories; they contain rich autobiographical and social information which is closely linked to individuals and reflexive of their lives. This study considers the food blog as an extension of this work. There are estimated to be at least 151 million food blogs globally, mostly individually authored accounts of meals prepared for family and friends, they provide rich retrospective accounts of the blogger’s food consumption practices. This study focuses upon the 169 blogs within the food group of Blipfoto. com, a membership blog site which encourages daily posts supplemented with photography.

40|$|Electrophysiological {{changes in}} the {{sensorimotor}} pathways were found to accompany the effect of rhythmic EEG patterns in the sensorimotor cortex. Additionally, several striking behavioral changes were seen, including in particular an enhancement of sleep and an elevation of seizure threshold to epileptogenic agents. This raised the possibility that human seizure disorders might be influenced therapeutically by similar training. Our objective in human EEG feedback training became not only the facilitation of normal rhythmic patterns, but also the suppression of abnormal activity, thus requiring complex contingencies directed to the normalization of the sensorimotor EEG. To achieve this, a multicomponent frequency analysis was developed to extract and separate normal and abnormal elements of the EEG signal. Each of these elements was transduced to a specific component of a visual display system, and these were combined through logic circuits to present the subject with a <b>symbolic</b> <b>display.</b> Variable criteria provided for the gradual shaping of EEG elements towards the desired normal pattern. Some 50 - 70 % of patients with poorly controlled seizure disorders experienced therapeutic benefits from this approach in our laboratory, and subsequently in many others. A more recent application of this approach to the modification of human brain function in our lab has been directed to the dichotomous problems of task overload and underload in the contemporary aviation environment.
