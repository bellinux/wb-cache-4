5|$|When rehearsals {{opened in}} September 1955, Rodgers {{assembled}} {{the cast and}} told them that he was going into the hospital for a minor operation.

The surgery required removal of part of the jawbone and tongue, and some of the lymph nodes. The operation took place on September 21, 1955; within ten days of the operation he was back in the theatre watching rehearsals, though for some time only as a spectator.|$|E

25|$|In August 2009, 18 {{months after}} joining Bolton, Cahill signed a new three-year {{contract}} with the club. He suffered a blood clot in his left arm after a training injury which forced him {{to pull out of}} the home match against Fulham on 6 February 2010; he <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> in hospital. The treatment for the ailment meant that Cahill could not play for a number of months.

25|$|Poor ratings {{resulted}} in there being no 2004 season but in July 2005 The Mole returned to Australian TV for its fifth season, subtitled as The Amazing Game. Tom Williams (Co-host of The Great Outdoors and {{winner of the}} Australian edition of Dancing with the Stars) was chosen to take over as host from Bowler, as he was not available for the project due to family commitments. This was met with mixed reaction from fans. This season also introduced {{a new concept to}} the show - live eliminations. The contestants <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> in New Zealand working on various challenges, and then their actions were broadcast on TV the following Thursday night, with a live elimination following directly after.|$|E

Only after the story of Boudria's stay at the Boulay estate broke in May did Boulay cash an $800 cheque from Boudria that was dated March 16, 2002; many found this to be too convenient, and opposition critics suggested that the cheque had been post-dated to explain away what {{would otherwise have been}} a major ethical violation on the part of Boudria. Boudria was forced to resign on 26 May, to be replaced with Ralph Goodale. An additional scandal broke later in May 2002 when it was revealed that the Defence Minister Art Eggleton had rewarded a contract worth $36, 500 to research mental illness amongst former soldiers to his former lover Maggie Maier without tender {{while at the same time}} the Defence Ministry had already hired a team of experts to research the same subject. As Eggleton was a Paul Martin supporter, Chrétien promptly fired him on May 27, 2002, following a ruling from Howard Wilson that Eggleton had broken conflict-of-interest rules. Some such as the columnist Don Martin believed that Wilson's swift running against the Martinista Eggleton was suspicious with Martin writing Wilson had within a day ruled that Eggleton had broken conflict-of-interest rules while Martin wrote: “But what would you call the prime minister’s chat with a Crown corporation banker to bail out a hotel linked to a golf course he may still have an interest in? Funny, ethics counsellor Howard Wilson was in a “see no evil” monkey mode on that score”.|$|E

She had seen his mother's bicycle there, she said; the {{prosecution}} later alleged that he had used this bicycle to cycle between his cottage and the farmhouse {{on the night of}} the murders, to avoid being seen in his car on the road. She told police Bamber had telephoned her at 9:50pm on 6 August to say he had been thinking about the crime all day, was [...] "pissed off", and that it was [...] "tonight or never". A few hours later, at 3:00–3:30am on 7 August, she said he phoned her again to say: [...] "Everything is going well. Something is wrong at the farm. I haven't had any sleep all night... bye honey and I love you lots." [...] Her flatmates' evidence suggested that call had come through closer to 3:00am. He called her later in the morning to tell her that Sheila had gone mad, and that a police car was coming to pick her up. When she arrived with the police at Bamber's cottage, she said he had pulled her to one side and said: [...] "I should have been an actor." ...|$|E

50|$|Former confederate soldier Captain W.B. Henderson {{purchased}} {{the land that}} was to become Weedon Island in 1886 with war bond. When Captain Henderson's daughter Blanche married Dr. Leslie Weedon in 1898, the Captain gave the new couple the Island as a wedding present. Weedon Island was only an island in high tide and during low tide it {{was connected to the}} peninsula. Leslie Weedon and his family <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekends</b> here from nearby Tampa. At that time there was no bridges across Tampa Bay so they traveled here with their belongings by boat and brought everything back home for the week days. Another family had lived here, The Benjamins who lived on nearby Benjamin Island. Henry R. Benjamin bought Benjamin Island for $1,000 (worth $23,000 in 2016) from Captain W.B.

Wood <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> drinking vodka. Around noon on Sunday, December 10, Wood felt ill and went to lie down in Coe's bedroom.

He clutched at the sheets. It looked like he'd seen hell." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kelly began {{associating with}} bushranger Harry Power. According to The Singleton Argus, on 16 March 1870, Power and Kelly stuck up and robbed a Mr McBean. Later that year on 2 May, Kelly {{was charged with}} robbery in company and accused of being Power's accomplice. The victims could not {{identify}} Kelly and the charges were dismissed. He was then charged with armed robbery, but the principal witness could not be located and the charges were dismissed. He was then charged a third time, for a hold-up with Power against a man named Murray. Although the victims for the third charge {{were reported to have}} also failed to identify Kelly, they had in fact been refused a chance to identify him by Superintendents Nicolas and Hare. Instead, Superintendent Nicolas told the magistrate that Kelly fitted the description and asked for him to be remanded to the Kyneton court for trial. Instead of being sent to Kyneton, he was sent to Melbourne where he <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> in the Richmond lock-up before transferring to Kyneton. No evidence was produced in court, and he was released after a month. Historians tend to disagree over this episode: Some see it as evidence of police harassment; others believe that the Kelly family intimidated the witnesses, making them reluctant to give evidence. Another factor in the lack of identification may have been that the witnesses had described Power's accomplice as a [...] "half-caste". However, Superintendent Nicolas and Captain Standish believed this {{to be the result of}} Kelly going unwashed.|$|E

30|$|These parents deeply {{stressed}} their wish {{to spend}} as much time as possible with their children, to enjoy plenty of quality-time as a family.

It became an annual event, held each June for the next 25 years, resulting in a huge collection of artwork created for Waring by the cartoonists, including many drawn on Shawnee Inn stationery. The Lone Ranger artist Tom Gill recalled: Fred Waring would hire these buses, and we would get onboard in Times Square.

50|$|At the Republican Convention, Nixon had {{pledged to}} {{campaign}} in all 50 states.

The knee became infected and Nixon had to cease campaigning for two weeks while the infection was injected with antibiotics. When he left Walter Reed Hospital, Nixon refused to abandon his pledge to visit every state; he thus wound up wasting valuable time visiting states {{that he had no}} chance to win, or that had few electoral votes and would be of little help in the election, or states that he would almost certainly win regardless. For example, in his effort to visit all 50 states, Nixon <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> vital <b>weekend</b> before <b>the</b> election campaigning in Alaska, which had only three electoral votes, while Kennedy campaigned in large states, such as New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.|$|R
