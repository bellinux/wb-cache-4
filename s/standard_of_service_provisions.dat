40|$|The <b>Standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Provision</b> for Lung Cancer Patients in New Zealand {{have been}} {{developed}} to ensure that people with lung cancer receive the best possible care, regardless of where they live. The standards include requirements for investigation, diagnosis, treatment and supportive care. They also specify waiting times for lung cancer treatment, and promote a multidisciplinary approach to treatment planning. The National Lung Cancer Working Group (NLCWG) developed the <b>Standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Provision</b> for Lung Cancer Patients in New Zealand in 2011 in a bid to improve outcomes for lung cancer patients and reduce inequalities associated with this disease. The NLCWG has now reviewed the standards to keep them up to date in the context of New Zealand health care. The NLCWG developed these standards {{based on the assumption that}} the appropriate governing bodies have credentialled the various clinical staff, laboratories and other special investigations involved. By revising the national standards the NLCWG continues to aim to improve the overall care of all patients with lung cancer. Although there have been improvements since these standards were first published, delays in access to first specialist assessment, diagnostic tests and definitive treatment remain areas for improvement. Access to palliative care services across New Zealand is currently inequitable, and the ability to capture and audit data for lung cancer patients needs attention. In general, services are managing patients receiving active cancer treatments appropriately, and so the NLCWG agreed that no major changes were required to the standards relating to active anti-cancer treatment. The standards apply to any person or organisation that provides care and services to patients with lung cancer in New Zealand. The NLCWG also intends that District Health Boards (DHBs) will use them to develop key performance indicators that will be audited and used to drive improvements in services...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEpilepsy is {{the most}} common serious chronic {{neurological}} condition. All patients with epilepsy regardless of location should receive the highest quality <b>of</b> <b>services</b> that can be provided. In order to do this current <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> has to be reviewed and benchmarked against ideal <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> that cover a comprehensive range <b>of</b> <b>services</b> to meet all patient needs. By critically reviewing the relevant literature, criteria were developed for an ideal epilepsy service. The literature review generated evidence-based ideal standards for the following <b>service</b> areas:•The role <b>of</b> primary care and the interface with secondary care in the management of epilepsy;•The role of Accident and Emergency (A&E) departments in the care of epilepsy;•Epilepsy clinics;•Specialist epilepsy nurses for treating epilepsy;•The role of the general practitioner (GP) specialist;•Services for adult epileptics with learning disabilities;•Services for complex epilepsy; and•User views.

40|$|Background: Trauma care in England {{is below}} the <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> when {{compared}} to many other developed countries. In recent {{years there has been}} an impetus for improvements in trauma care and as a result, Trauma Systems are beginning to roll out across England to meet the complex needs of trauma patients and bring the quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> into line with international comparators. Aim: This review aims to explore the extent to which, new and evolving Trauma Systems in England, can learn and implement ideas from their mature and established counterparts overseas to deliver high quality trauma care to severely injured patients. Methods: A critical review of the literature has been undertaken and an analytical framework has been developed to explore and assess the components of an effective Trauma System. Findings: After reviewing the literature on Trauma Systems focussing on topics of patient outcomes, business case and nursing, it was found that systematic improvements in trauma care occur over time with improvements in system organisation and structure. Further improvements in Trauma Systems can come from comprehensive treatment of all triage positive patients within the Trauma System, additional data collection addressing trauma morbidities and patient quality <b>of</b> life, <b>service</b> and system evaluation to identify and address inadequacies, rehabilitation improvements and long term patient follow up, trauma prevention strategies and facilitation of nurse empowerment and professional development. Conclusion: The 2012 Framework for Trauma Systems has been developed and used as an analytical tool to identify the components of an effective Trauma System. It should be adopted when implementing and assessing effective trauma systems to ensure that all patient and system needs are addressed. A critical P a g e | vii review of the literature has been conducted and recommendations for effective trauma system implementation in England have been made...|$|R
40|$|Emergency on-call duties {{have been}} {{highlighted}} {{as a key}} stress factor in newly qualified physiotherapists whose job performance may be affected. The concept of stress relating to on-call work, the general lack of interest or confidence in the respiratory on-call field, and subsequent difficulties with recruitment and retention, pose a difficult problem for managers <b>of</b> <b>services</b> responsible {{for the maintenance of}} a competent workforce and a high <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision.</b> Differences in novice and expert physiotherapists’ patient management and clinical reasoning strategies have been previously examined in orthopaedic, neurology, domiciliary and cardiorespiratory fields. However, no such investigations have been undertaken in the field of emergency on-call. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if differences existed between novice and expert physiotherapists who had by definition differing levels of context-related experience within the emergency on-call environment. This study also aimed to consider what factors may influence their physiotherapy intervention for an acute cardiorespiratory patient. A purpose-designed vignette-based postal questionnaire was administered to 26 emergency on-call providers in New Zealand. The questionnaire sought demographic data, investigated participants’ attitudes towards emergency on-call <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> and presented a vignette-based clinical scenario which asked questions throughout an evolving clinical case scenario. Analysis was performed using the computer software package for social sciences, SPSS for Windows (version 14), results were analysed using descriptive statistics, and significance testing was performed using non-parametric methods. A good response rate was achieved (78. 8 %; n = 56). Statistically significant differences between novices and experts were determined in scores for confidence, stress, and support required, also in the factors affecting stress levels. Novices are less confident (p = <. 0001), more stressed (p = <. 001) and require more support than experts (p = <. 001). Factors which influenced both novice, and to a lesser extent, expert stress levels when working as emergency on-call physiotherapists, were established. A relationship was determined between confidence and level of support required (r = -. 65; p = <. 001); confidence and amount of stress felt (r = -. 58; p = <. 001); and support required and stress felt (r =. 47; p = <. 001). Some differences were demonstrated between novice and expert physiotherapists in their answers to a clinical case scenario. Although these were not statistically significant, a trend was noted which may reflect the different clinical reasoning strategies of these physiotherapists. There is a need for novices to gain the type of experience which includes independent problem solving and guided reflection; the use of vignette-based case studies may be one method which could be further exploited. The profession is responsible for the provision of better ways to meet the needs of our future emergency on-call workforce. If this is not achieved, other professional groups will be required to fill the gaps and physiotherapy; particularly cardiorespiratory physiotherapy will lose out...|$|R

40|$|Resumo: O objetivo deste trabalho é de estudar comparativamente as redes de transportes de pagamentos por cartão eletrônico em três redes de abastecimento em meios eletrônicos de pagamento: no Brasil, na Inglaterra e nos Estados Unidos da América. Os casos Brasileiro, Britânico e Americano foram selecionados por claramente configurarem diferentes níveis de maturidade de compartilhamento das vias de transporte, chamado no setor por Interoperabilidade. O meio de pagamento via cartão de crédito, débito e "charge" revolucionaram o modelo de pagamento por produtos e serviços. No modelo econômico moderno é raro encontrar alguma loja que não aceite cartões como meios de pagamento. Outra revolução comportamental resultante do meio de pagamento por cartão é caracterizada pela diferença na sincronia entre o pagamento por produtos e serviços e a quitação dos mesmos débitos. Nesse contexto o desenvolvimento de meios eletrônicos de pagamentos alterou tanto a procura como a oferta de produtos e serviços na medida em que, entre outras características, possibilita que as pessoas tomem mais créditos pelo encorajamento de financiar suas despesas no tempo. Usualmente na {{literatura}} este assunto é tratado através de uma base econômica, sob a perspectiva de segurança na transferência de dados e infraestrutura física de tecnologia de informação. No entanto, os padrões de serviço de oferta e a demanda por meio eletrônico de pagamento são influenciados pelo comportamento dos seus clientes, pela maturidade do mercado em que estão inseridos e por questões de regulação governamental. Valendo-se do método de estudos de casos prospectivos para analisar os fluxos de transportes de pagamento por cartão eletrônico este estudo busca analisar as mudanças nos padrões de oferta e demanda do serviço, provocado pela alteração na regulamentação do setor que se abriu para modelo concorrencial em 2010. Através do desenvolvimento de conteúdo teórico a prático sobre transporte de pagamentos por cartão eletrônico esta dissertação busca contribuir para um maior entendimento das cadeias logísticas sob as perspectivas de abastecimento logístico e de oferta e demanda de serviços. ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this work}} is to study the transport flows of electronic payments by card in three supply networks in electronic means of payment: in Brazil, England and the United States of America. The Brazilian, British and American cases were selected by clearly configure different levels of maturity of sharing of transport flows, called in the industry for interoperability. The means of payment via credit card, debit, and "charge" revolutionized the model of payment for products and services. In modern economic model is rare to find a shop that does not accept cards as means of payment. Other behavioral revolution resulting from the means of payment by card is characterized by difference in synchrony between the payment for products and services and the discharge of the same charges. In this context, the development of electronic payments has changed both the demand and supply <b>of</b> products and <b>services</b> to the extent that, among other characteristics, enables people to take more credits by encouragement to finance its expenditure in time. Usually in literature this subject is dealt with {{by means of an}} economic base, from the perspective of security of data transfer and physical infrastructure of information technology. However, the <b>Standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> and the demand for electronic means of payment are influenced by the behavior of their customers, for the maturity of the market in which they are inserted and by issues of government regulation. Using the method of studies of prospective cases to analyze the transport flows of payment by e-card this study seeks to analyze the changes in the patterns of supply and demand for the service, caused by the change in the regulation of the sector that has opened to competition model in 2010. Through the development of theoretical content to practical on transport of payments by e-card this dissertation aims to contribute to a greater understanding of the logistics chains under the prospects of supply logistics and supply and demand for services...|$|R

The literature reveals {{gaps in the}} continuity of care for HIV and sexual and reproductive health. This study assessed whether improved service delivery models increased the uptake and cost-effectiveness of HIV and sexual and reproductive health services. Methods Adult clients 18 + years of age accessing family planning (females), HIV testing and counseling (females and males), and male circumcision services (males) were recruited, enrolled and individually randomized {{to one of three}} study arms: 1) the <b>standard</b> model <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> at the entry point (N[*]=[*] 1319); 2) an enhanced counseling and referral to add-on service with follow-up (N[*]=[*] 1323); and 3) the components of study arm two, with the additional offer of an escort (N[*]=[*] 1321). Interviews were conducted with the same clients at baseline, six weeks and six months. Uptake <b>of</b> <b>services</b> for HIV, family planning, male circumcision, and cervical cancer screening at six weeks and six months were the primary endpoints. Pairwise chi-square and multivariable logistic regression statistical tests assessed differences across study arms, which were also assessed for incremental cost-efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Results A total of 3963 clients, 1920 males and 2043 females, were enrolled; 82  % of participants at six weeks were tracked and 81  % at six months; follow-up rates did not vary significantly by study arm. The odds of clients accessing HIV testing and counseling, cervical cancer screening services among females, and circumcision services among males varied significantly by study arm at six weeks and six months; less consistent findings were observed for HIV care and treatment. Client uptake <b>of</b> family planning <b>services</b> did not vary significantly by study arm.

40|$|Editorial: Biochemical {{toxicology}} for {{the coroner}} should encompass a wide ranging analytical screen for drugs and toxic compounds. A multidisciplinary case conference in appropriate complex cases must {{become the norm}} to furnish the coroner with expert advice where toxicology {{is a factor in}} the cause of death. A networked Institute <b>of</b> Forensic <b>Services</b> in Ireland should be formed to integrate toxicology, chemical pathology and histopathology in the provision of best quality scientific reports for coroners. In the Coroner's Act 1962 in Ireland, Section 33 sets the statutory arrangements for post-mortem and special examinations. For toxicology, "a coroner may request the minister to arrange - (b) a special examination by way of analysis, test or otherwise by a person appointed by the minister of particular parts or contents of the body or any other relevant substances or things,". In the Coroner's Act (Northern Ireland) 1959, Section 30 reads a "coroner who considers an analysis of any matter or thing of or concerning any dead body to be necessary may direct that such analysis be made by or under the supervision of a registered medical practitioner on the list mentioned in section twenty-six or by or {{under the supervision of the}} Director of the Northern Ireland Forensic Science Laboratory and it shall be the duty of such registered medical practitioner or Director (as the case may be) to submit a report of such analysis to the coroner”. In the Coroner's Bill 2007 in Ireland, Part 10 concerns post-mortem and special examinations. Section 74, (3) states "Where a registered medical practitioner conducts a post-mortem examination or arranges for the conduct of a special examination [...] . he or she shall do so under the direction of the coroner. " The Review <b>of</b> the Coroners <b>Service,</b> Report <b>of</b> the Working Party, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform 2000, identified the long delays in biochemical toxicology analysis time and in the processing of tissue samples from autopsies as impeding the coronial process 1. The maintenance of a Centre of Excellence to serve the coronial system was recommended but no such centre exists currently. The problem with the State Laboratory service is its isolation from clinical practice and its role in proving services to many sectors including agriculture. University College Dublin houses the Medical Bureau of Road Safety which also provides analytical services in drug toxicology in relation to driving under the influence of intoxicants. Other than turn-around times for reports, nowhere in the Report are the substantive issues <b>of</b> delineating minimum <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision,</b> in the scale and breath of toxicological screening, clinical governance involving toxicologists, chemical pathologists and biochemists and analytical best practice, mentioned for services in the Republic. The Report of the Working Party recommended the establishment of a committee to devise coroners’ rules. The Rules Committee Report is inadequate in the biochemical toxicology sphere. Toxicology requires interpretative expertise with knowledge of toxicity, pharmacology and internal medicine. Factors which influence the biochemical result include the anatomical site of blood or other matrix sampling, the body storage temperature, the interval since death and movements and position of the body. There is in addition post-mortem redistribution of drugs and ante-mortem drug metabolism which must be considered to minimise interpretative errors 2, 3. Utilisation of appropriate expertise should be included in any set of coroners’ rules to reduce the likelihood of misinterpretation 4, 5. The degree of diversity of biochemical screening for toxins should be agreed nationally and remain constantly under review in response to local, national and international developments in substance abuse. A multidisciplinary conference involving toxicology input in relevant cases should be a standard best-practice procedure to advise on the interpretation of the post-mortem findings in complex cases prior to the autopsy pathologist reporting the conclusions to the coroner. Meetings could be arranged both by video conference call and in person. Standard templates for reporting common analytes should be agreed to limit the number of case conferences. This is an important safeguard for the scientific integrity of the coronial process. Because the lawyer coroner is not in a position to specify the extent of analytical screening, the role of the toxicology interpretative and analytical service must be explicitly recognised. The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 in England and Wales specifies that there are training requirements for Medical Examiners in their new system both before and during their period in office 6. The Medical Council in Ireland mandates audit as part of the Professional Competence programme in all areas which is a legal requirement since May 2011. These provide the templates for action. The Coronial Service for Northern Ireland, operating still under the 1959 Act, does not require the reporting pathologist to hold a multidisciplinary meeting when there are positive toxicology results. However, system reform should include a multidisciplinary reporting system. Clinical governance and accreditation of the process should be centred around academic departments in both Irish jurisdictions. A networked Institute <b>of</b> Forensic Toxicology <b>Services</b> is possible in Ireland within current resources. The now routine practice of multidisciplinary case conferences in appropriate cases in hospitals must be brought to the coronial system. This is the surest way to limit interpretative errors and underpin the scientific integrity of the coronial system.

40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the nature of}} South African municipal water service delivery, and how marketing strategies can {{provide a framework for}} better management <b>of</b> this <b>service.</b> It reflects on the elements that guide municipal decision making and evaluates user preferences for levels of the municipal “water service mix” by employing conjoint analysis. Particular attention is paid to consumer willingness to pay for improvements in the “water service mix”. The study argues that the values municipal consumers attach to the variables <b>of</b> the water <b>service</b> mix need to be better incorporated into decision making regarding water service delivery, and that conjoint analysis is an informative method to assist in generating this information. The study outlines a water service marketing challenge and methods of research followed to deal with it (Chapter One) {{and the nature of the}} laws and institutions governing water <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> in South Africa (Chapter Two). The task <b>of</b> providing water <b>services</b> is delegated to Water Service Providers (municipalities). The key variables <b>of</b> the water <b>service</b> mix from the consumers perspective include; quality of the water, rate of flow from tap, interruption of water flow, sewerage disposal, assurance of supply, and water service tariffs (Chapter Three). The study covers the areas of Amathole, Kouga and Nelson Mandela Bay Municipalities' (Chapter Five). The method of marketing analysis applied is conjoint analysis, alternatively known as choice experiment analysis. An overview of the method is provided and its application to three samples of one hundred residents at each of the study sites is described in Chapter Four. The responses of the three hundred residents provide the basis for the results. Respondents were requested to make a series of choices between alternative water <b>service</b> mixes consisting <b>of</b> six variables differentiated by three levels (Chapter Three). In making these choices they implicitly compared and weighed up the relative worth of the selected variables against each other. The findings of the analysis were diverse (Chapter Six); two of the three estimated models did not yield significant results. An interpretation of these results showed that the respondents of the Kouga municipality were willing to pay R 65. 05 more (per 10 xii Kilolitres of water) than their current monthly tariff for a marginal improvement in water quality, R 57. 29 more (per 10 Kilolitres of water) per month for a marginal improvement in sewerage disposal and R 21. 90 (per 10 Kilolitres) per month for marginal improvements in assurance of water supply. Findings showed that willingness to pay for reduced interruptions and improved flow rates was lower and not as highly valued as the abovementioned variables. Most of these findings were consistent with similar international and national studies showing their reliability. Although there has been significant improvement in extending the reach of the network since 1994, the <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> water <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> in South African municipalities do not appear to have improved. The results of this study mirror a number of concerns that have been expressed about the <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> particularly sanitation (in publications like the Green Drop Report). Municipal service delivery in these areas would appear to be constrained by a number of issues including a lack of public involvement, legislation, limited financial resources and institutional capabilities. However, it is a service that is too vitally important to be allowed to deteriorate. Marketing analyses can make a valuable contribution to allocating and managing the scarce resources to best satisfy the consumers <b>of</b> water <b>services</b> (Chapter Seven). When consumer orientation is formally introduced as the main objective into the thinking <b>of</b> the <b>service</b> provider, it becomes untenable to offer poor service delivery. But that is exactly what many municipalities appear to be doing. There is a need to get back to the basics – where the consumer is king. This analysis concludes that consumers want, above all else, assurance of water supply, a high quality of water, and safe environmentally sensitive disposal of waste water. It is recommended that municipalities not lose sight of the fact that price is an important part of the marketing mix. From the paying consumers perspective, when the government incorporate too many other considerations into pricing <b>of</b> water <b>services</b> they are, in effect, disengaging price from the marketing mix by not being sensitive to consumer needs. This approach shows a weak marketing strategy, and may result in dissatisfied consumers who may become unwilling to pay for their water services – an outcome that the researcher would discourag...|$|R

40|$|The <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> {{in rural}} areas is {{constrained}} {{by a number of}} issues arising from the remoteness of such areas and the relative sparsity of rural populations. These factors combine to increase the cost of supply and reduce the demand for services, which consequently threatens the viability <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> whether by the public or private sectors. A possible to solution to these issues lies in the co-location <b>of</b> rural <b>services,</b> which in general means that two or more distinct services are located within the same premises thus reducing the delivery costs associated with one or more <b>of</b> these <b>services.</b> Beyond the simple economics <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> lies the existence of non-market elements <b>of</b> <b>services</b> in terms <b>of</b> benefits to local communities <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> that might arise from the social elements <b>of</b> local provided <b>services</b> such as community cohesion. This paper applies non-market valuation to quantify these benefits in three case studies across Scotland. The results indicate that relative degree of these benefits can be related to the remoteness of rural communities in that more remote communities particularly value the community aspects <b>of</b> <b>services</b> whereas less remote communities are more resistant to increased distances to access services. More generally, the results provide evidence on the inherent trade-offs between factors such as opening hours, levels <b>of</b> <b>service</b> and distance {{that can be used in}} determining the optimal configuration <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision.</b> Community/Rural/Urban Development, Public Economics,...|$|R
40|$|Reputation enables {{customers}} to select between providers, and balance risk against other aspects <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision.</b> For new providers that {{have yet to}} establish a track record, negative ratings can significantly impact on their chances of being selected. Existing work has shown that malicious or inaccurate reviews, and subjective differences, can be accounted for. However, an honest balanced review <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> may still be an unreliable predictor of future performance if the circumstances differ. Specifically, mitigating circumstances may have affected previous provision. For example, while a delivery service may generally be reliable, a particular delivery may be delayed by unexpected flooding. A common way to ameliorate such effects is by weighting the influence of past events on reputation by their recency. In this paper, we argue that it is more effective to query detailed records <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision,</b> using patterns that describe the circumstances to determine the significance of previous interactions...|$|R

Political analysis offers {{an understanding of what}} might otherwise appear to be exclusively managerial or capacity problems. The articles in this special issue of PMR contribute to three main aspects of this new literature on the political economy <b>of</b> <b>service</b> provision: how the incentives of elites are formed and affect whether, to whom and how services are provided; how top-down and bottom-up systems of accountability may act and also interact to affect incentives; and the effect <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> on state-society relations. The analysis in this and the following articles suggests that the politics <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> should be understood as a cycle of causation: politics affect the policy, governance and implementation <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> but in turn <b>service</b> <b>provision</b> is a theatre of politics and affects citizen formation and the development of state capacity and legitimacy.
