Thus, captive-hydrogen-mediated production of greenhouse-neutral methane has been proposed (note that this is the reverse of the present method of acquiring hydrogen from natural methane, but one that does not require ultimate burning and release of fossil fuel carbon). Captive hydrogen (and carbon dioxide from, for example, CCS (Carbon Capture & Storage)) may be used onsite to synthesize methane, using the Sabatier reaction. This is about 60% efficient, and with the round trip reducing to 20 to 36% depending on the method of fuel utilization. This is even lower than hydrogen, but the storage costs drop by at least a factor of 3, because of methane's higher boiling point and higher energy density. Liquid methane has 3.2 times the energy density of liquid hydrogen and is easier to store compactly. Additionally, the pipe infrastructure (natural gas pipelines) are already in place. Natural-gas-powered vehicles already exist, and are known to be easier to adapt from existing internal engine technology, than internal combustion autos running directly on hydrogen. Experience with natural gas powered vehicles shows that methane storage is inexpensive, once one has accepted the cost of conversion to store the fuel. However, the cost of alcohol storage is even lower, so this technology would need to produce methane at a considerable savings with regard to alcohol production. Ultimate mature prices of fuels in the competing technologies are not presently known, but both are expected to offer substantial infrastructural savings over attempts to transport and use hydrogen directly.|$|E

40|$|The cost of {{producing}} alcohol naturally varies with the raw material and with the process. In the case of corn alcohol, the raw material charge is the major cost item; therefore, instead of selecting one cost for alcohol from corn, a graph is presented showing estimated cost {{of producing}} alcohol vs. the price of corn. The graph is a straight line showing an alcohol cost of 27 to 30 cents per gallon with corn at 40 cents per bushel and an alcohol cost of 83 to 86 cents with corn at $ 2. 00 per bushel. Molasses alcohol is made from a by-product of sugar refining which, if not sold, can be disposed of only at considerable expense. It is expected that molasses will sell at such a price that molasses alcohol will be coopetitive with <b>synthetic</b> <b>alcohol,</b> which is made from ethylene. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>alcohol</b> is estimated to cost 24 to 27 cents per gallon by the indirect hydration process and 16 to 20 cents per gallon by the direct hydration process. It is estimated that alcohol is produced from the one waste sulfite liquor plant in the United Stntes at a cost which lies between 24 and 28 cents per gallon. The American plant for making alcohol from wood waste has never been operated successfully; {{it is estimated that}} when operating difficulties are overcome the alcohol will cost about 26 cents per gallon. Alcohol fron agricultural waste is tentatively estimated at 22 cents per gallon {{on the basis of a}} preliminary economic evaluation. The cost of alcohol from the Fischer-Tropsch oxygenated by-products is part of a joint cost, hence that fraction of the total cost which is charged to alcohol is arbitrary. [ [...] . ] A decision as to whether the subsidization of corn alcohol is or is not advisable lies beyond the scope of this report, since the decision involves the consideration of political as well as economic factors.

40|$|Catherine Reilly {{looks at}} radical {{research}} into developing ‘safe’ <b>synthetic</b> <b>alcohol</b> and examines the overall health and societal impact of alcohol abuse. Imagine a future with {{a version of}} alcohol that does not damage the liver, heart or brain, {{is less likely to}} cause dependence, and has easily reversible effects. Prof David Nutt, the Edmond J Safra Professor of Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, is not just imagining this future – he is chasing it. Safe <b>synthetic</b> <b>alcohol</b> could ultimately save the lives of millions of people every year, he tells the Medical Independent (MI). “To achieve that {{would be one of the}} great advances in Western medicine,” he says. Prof Nutt, former Chairman of the UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, is leading research aimed at creating a <b>synthetic</b> <b>alcohol</b> that targets the same receptors as the neurotransmitter, gamma aminobutyric acid, which has a calming effect on the central nervous system. The substance would seem like any other drink but with the added benefit of an antidote. “So you can go to a party, have a good time, take the antidote, and you can then drive home safely. ” This may sound like an idyll to many: but would induced relaxation not result in some of the same issues associated with alcohol, such as reckless behaviour? “I think we can have a plateau, a maximum effect which is below the level of loss of control,” answers Prof Nutt. “The thing about alcohol is, once you get to a certain level, you get so intoxicated that you don’t know what you are doing, you lose judgement, and then people do very dangerous things. By being very clever with how we make this molecule, we can avoid intense intoxication. ” Prof Nutt is working with colleagues at Imperial College London and other experts on this initiative. “We are looking for funding – we have got one or two potential investors now. We are going to the stage of getting the prototypes tested,” he tells MI. Until such a game-changer emerges, however, the issue of alcohol misuse will continue to play out as a tug of war between politicians of various hues, policy makers, public health specialists and the drinks industry. Prof Nutt says David Cameron’s government — “lobbied to death” by the drinks industry — “chickened out” on plans to introduce minimum pricing and he underlines the importance of measures such as eliminating cheap alcohol, ending alcohol advertising and banning sponsorship of sporting events by the drinks industry. Will the Irish Government ‘chicken out’ on alcohol policy too? Some would suggest that, to a certain extent, it already has. The Government approved a wide-ranging package of measures on alcohol misuse in October. However, it stalled a decision on whether to ban sponsorship of sporting events by drinks companies, following an earlier proposal from the Department of Health that supported its phasing out by 2020. This move was blocked by a number of ministers. Instead, it was announced in October that a “working group” was being established to report on the “value, evidence, feasibility and implications” of regulating such sponsorship; and to consider financial implications and alternative sources of funding for sporting organisations to replace potential lost revenue arising from any such regulation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Sustainable {{utilization}} of plant biomass as renewable source for fuels and chemical building blocks requires a complex mixture of diverse enzymes, including hydrolases which comprise the largest class of lignocellulolytic enzymes. These enzymes {{need to be}} available in large amounts at a low price to allow sustainable and economic biotechnological processes. Over the past years Pichia pastoris has become an attractive host for the cost-efficient production and engineering of heterologous (eukaryotic) proteins due to several advantages. Results In this paper codon optimized genes and <b>synthetic</b> <b>alcohol</b> oxidase 1 promoter variants were used to generate Pichia pastoris strains which individually expressed cellobiohydrolase 1, cellobiohydrolase 2 and beta-mannanase from Trichoderma reesei and xylanase A from Thermomyces lanuginosus.

Additionally, we compared our achieved yields of secreted enzymes and the corresponding activities to literature data. Conclusion In our experiments we could clearly show the importance of gene optimization and strain characterization for successfully improving secretion levels. We also present a basic guideline how to correctly interpret the interplay of promoter strength and gene dosage for a successful improvement of the secretory production of lignocellulolytic enzymes in Pichia pastoris. </p...|$|E

The mean fiber diameters ranged from 57 to 126 nm with fibers having a broad diameter distribution (10 − 280 nm). The mean diameter of the nanofibers decreased with increasing surfactant concentration and decreasing eugenol concentration. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that microemulsion droplets were homogenously dispersed throughout the nanofibers. Results suggest that electrospun nanofibers may serve as carrier vehicles for microemulsions containing solubilized lipophilic functional compounds such as bioactives, antimicrobials, antioxidants, flavors, and pharmaceuticals...|$|R
