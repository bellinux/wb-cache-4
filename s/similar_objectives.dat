In October 1943, Bagramyan's 11th Guards Army was transferred to the Second Baltic Front which was concentrated on the retaking of Belarus and namely, the Baltic republics. In November, Stalin offered Bagramyan the position of head commander of the First Baltic Front which had the <b>similar</b> <b>objectives</b> of the Second but was making little headway in its attempts to advance northwards.|$|E

25|$|The Gestapo–NKVD {{conferences}} were {{a series}} of security police meetings organized in late 1939 and early 1940 by Germany and the Soviet Union, following their joint invasion of Poland {{in accordance with the}} Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The meetings enabled both parties to pursue specific goals and aims as outlined independently by Hitler and Stalin, with regard to the acquired, formerly Polish territories. The conferences were held by the Gestapo and the NKVD officials in several Polish cities. In spite of their differences on other issues, both Heinrich Himmler and Lavrentiy Beria had <b>similar</b> <b>objectives</b> as far as the fate of the prewar Poland was concerned.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} 2001 to 2006 was {{the period that}} Thaksin Shinawatra came into power. It {{was a period of}} {{increased}} democratization and diversification of civil society in Thailand, as the Thai parliament withdrew itself from religious affairs. The temple thrived on this, though the temple did work on <b>similar</b> <b>objectives</b> as the government in terms of education, health care and even national security. The temple was no longer at the margins of the religious landscape in Thailand, but started to integrate itself within the Maha Nikaya fraternity. It was the period the temple cremated their teacher Maechi Chandra, and it was a period that the temple started to expand its activities to a national scale.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{societies}} share {{a common}} value of people helping each other; not only do volunteer acts assist others, but they also benefit the volunteering individual on a personal level. Despite having <b>similar</b> <b>objectives,</b> tension can arise between volunteers and state-provided services. In order to curtail this tension, most countries develop policies and enact legislation to clarify the roles and relationships among governmental stakeholders and their voluntary counterparts; this regulation identifies and allocates the necessary legal, social, administrative, and financial support of each party. This is particularly necessary when some voluntary activities {{are seen as a}} challenge to the authority of the state(e.g., on 29 January 2001, President Bush cautioned that volunteer groups should supplement—not replace—government agencies’ work).|$|E
25|$|The Toronto, Grey and Bruce and the Toronto and Nipissing Railways were promoted, at {{the same}} time, and with <b>similar</b> <b>objectives,</b> by an {{interlocking}} group of Ontario businessmen and politicians. It {{is not surprising that}} the group should economise by employing one Chief Engineer who would apply the same design principles and choices on both lines. The first consulting Engineer in Canada was John Edward Boyd of New Brunswick, who conducted the preliminary surveys over the ground to Orangeville and Uxbridge. Douglas Fox came to Canada several times in 1868 and 1869 to support the parliamentary campaign and verify the surveys. On his return to England in the summer of 1869 he made arrangements for an associate, Edmund Wragge, to come to Canada at once to take up the engineering of both lines. In August Wragge visited Pihl in Norway to see his narrow-gauge lines, and arrived in Toronto in September 1869. The tenders for the first sections of line were immediately put out.|$|E
25|$|Falls {{rejected}} {{claims that}} British methods were predictable, noting that attacks {{had been made}} at dawn, noon, afternoon and at night. Bombardments had been fired before some attacks, during attacks on other occasions, on call from the infantry or were dispensed with. Attacks had been made indirectly, using ground for cover {{and a number of}} outflanking moves had succeeded. Combined operations with infantry, cavalry, cyclists, armoured cars and aircraft had also occurred. The most successful divisions in the pursuit were those that had been on the Somme for a considerable time, rather than the newer divisions, which were fresh and had trained for open warfare in England. Many of the British attacks had substantial casualties, mostly from German machine-gun fire, although artillery casualties were also high. Attacks on <b>similar</b> <b>objectives</b> using different methods had similar casualties, which suggested that losses were determined by the German defence, rather than unsatisfactory British methods. British field artillery had been supplied with an adequate amount of ammunition, despite the transport difficulties but much heavy artillery was left behind.|$|E

Thompson intended the weapon as an automatic [...] "trench-broom" [...] to sweep enemy troops from the trenches, filling a role for which the Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) had been proven ill-suited.

2500|$|A {{long line}} of {{scholars}} has challenged conventional views of the African diaspora as a mere dispersion of Black people. For them, it is a movement of liberation that opposes the implications of racialization. Their position assumes that Africans and their descendants abroad struggle to reclaim power over their lives through voluntary migration, cultural production and political conceptions and practices. It also implies the presence of cultures of resistance with <b>similar</b> <b>objectives</b> throughout the global diaspora. Thinkers like W. E. B. Dubois and more recently Robin Kelley, for example, have argued that Black politics of survival reveal more {{about the meaning of}} the African diaspora than labels of ethnicity and race, and degrees of skin hue. From this view, the daily struggle against what they call the [...] "world-historical processes" [...] of racial colonization, capitalism, and western domination defines Blacks links to Africa.|$|E
