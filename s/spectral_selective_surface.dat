Despite many developments on transition metal oxide and metal nitride based selective solar absorbers, these materials are yet to be commercialized for solar thermal conversion applications.

However {{to the best of our}} knowledge, utilization of mixed metal oxide/graphene oxide thin films as solar <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> is yet to be explored. Both CuCoO and graphene oxide (GO) have generated significant research interest and have widespread applications in clean energy devices due to the good combinations of many important properties. Therefore, in this work we focus on the introduction of GO to the 3 d transition metal-based CuCoO coatings and develop the new types optical thin films via dip-coating sol-gel technology to be used as solar <b>selective</b> <b>surfaces.</b> It is believed that use of graphene oxide in wet chemistry based sol-gel derived thin films will explore the new platform of producing highly efficient <b>selective</b> solar <b>surfaces.</b> Generally, 3 d transition metal nitride based thin film coatings are studied for structural, mechanical, and electrical applications. However, a very limited number of investigations are directed in search of their optical and solar selective behaviors.

40|$|Reconfigurable antennas have {{recently}} formed a popular research topic. They are attracting {{the interest of}} many industry professionals. This is basically due to the growing demands for more functionality while occupying the same or even smaller physical volume. Using various antennas for wireless applications is no longer effective because having several antennas take too much space. Reconfigurable antennas are the best solution to provide a better performance in terms of flexibility, efficiency and combination of several electromagnetic spectrum applications. Frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surfaces</b> are exploited in many communication applications, especially in designing reconfigurable antennas due {{to their ability to}} control the electromagnetic field. A frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> is an important figure concept in reconfigurable antenna structures and has developed rapidly due to their unique properties in suppressing the surface wave propagation. The main topic of this research is to design new reconfigurable radiation pattern antennas with enhanced performance by using switchable frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The antenna consists of a central radiating source surrounded by switchable frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> unit cells to give the antenna beam, shaping capability to scan 360 degree in the azimuth plane. Novel switchable frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> unit cells with various structures are designed and their characteristics are compared in both the reflective and transparent states. The reconfigurable response is the basic concept in the antenna design. This is achieved by adding PIN diodes to the lines that will connect or disconnect the unit cells and transform the frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> to be either a reflective or a transparent surface. As a consequence, switching the frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> PIN diodes leads to control the antenna beam direction. In this thesis, two novel reconfigurable antennas with frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> unit cells are presented, each antenna works at a different frequency band. The switchable frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> utilized in the proposed antennas operates at different frequency bands. The research topic in this thesis includes investigations and techniques to increase the bandwidth and improve the radiation characteristics of the reconfigurable antennas by using new switchable frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surface</b> unit cells. Experimental results show the preference of the proposed antennas over those presented in the literature. Thus, two new reconfigurable antennas are implemented and their enhanced performances in terms of bandwidth are proven...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that for {{high-power}} microwaves and other extreme environments, the use of resonant metallic elements in frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surfaces</b> can be problematic. The solution developed within this dissertation to solve these problems was to use guided-mode resonance phenomenon to create all-dielectric frequency <b>selective</b> <b>surfaces</b> that could survive these extreme environments. ^ To fully understand how these devices work, three different computational electromagnetic methods are formulated and implemented. The formulation of these methods start with the differential form of Maxwell’s equation and are derived {{all the way down}} to the final simulation state.
