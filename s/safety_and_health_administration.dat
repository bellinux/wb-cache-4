Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The synthetic pyrethroids represent a major class of insecticides because of their widespread use in modern agriculture. Analysis of these compounds has been difficult because of their thermal instability and photoinstability. The present study was initiated to investigate the applicability of a Competition Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay to the analysis of trace levels of cypermethrin in air samples. The Occupational <b>Safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Administrations</b> (OSHA) sampling procedure and a modified version of their analytical procedure was the preferred methodology chosen to collect and analyze samples. Experiments were conducted to determine if the antibody detected the antigen (cypermethrin); to determine if the OVS- 2 sampling tube caused any problems in the assay; to determine if each individual reagent caused any additional inhibition in the immunoassay; and to determine if there were any effects caused by the 96 -well microliter plates. All of the experiments were negative. Meaning they were not the cause of the associated problems resulting in an underestimation of the immunoassay. The result of this research found that OSHA's solvent extraction procedure cannot be used as the extraction method for the immunoassay procedure established by Stanker et al. Apparently the solvent extraction solution consisting of triphenylphosphate and toluene denatured or interfered with the antibody. Therefore, it is recommended that further research be conducted in this area and that an extraction methodology be developed specifically for the immunoassay...|$|R

40|$|The {{petrochemical}} industry {{is subject to}} various federal and local regulations and requirements that are challenging to meet and resource-intensive. Time and human factors often lead to a ?check box? mentality where requirements are fully complied with ?on paper? {{with little or no}} emphasis on quality of compliance. Occupational <b>Safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Administration?s</b> (OSHA) Process <b>Safety</b> Management (PSM) requirements are often exposed to this ?check box? mentality, especially the Process Hazard Analysis (PHA) element, which is the engine that drives and affects the whole PSM program. Poor implementation of PHA affects mechanical integrity, operating procedures, training, and emergency response, and is considered a root cause of most major incidents. Unfortunately, poor quality PHAs are widespread, hard to identify and can be more dangerous than conducting no PHA at all since it may provide a false sense of safety. Unfortunately, existing literature as well as recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (RAGAGEP) do not provide sufficient guidelines for assessing PHA quality. The guidelines proposed in this thesis help in properly auditing PHA studies by identifying traps and bad practices that most companies fall into when performing PHAs. The resulting guidelines are developed based on detailed incident investigation reports where root causes included inadequate PHA performance. In addition, expert opinion expressed in published papers highlighting specific gaps in PHA performance, and best practices of PHA implementation are utilized to identify common gaps and means for auditors to acquire evidence of reduced quality. The biggest contributors to the reduction of PHA quality include failing to consider lessons learned previous incidents, reduced quality of PHA inputs such as process safety information, competence of the PHA team members in their respective fields and time allocated for them to complete the PHA, accounting for human factors when relying on operator action to return the process to its safe state, as well as failing to perform PHAs for non-routine mode of operations. These contributors and others are discussed thoroughly on how they affect quality of PHAs and how auditors would obtain evidence that supports lack of quality. The proposed guidelines compiled in Appendix A should be used as part of an overall PSM audit. Using these guidelines by themselves would result in an incomplete assessment of the PHA. This {{is due to the fact}} that effective PHA element implementation depends on several other PSM elements that are considered foundational to PHA implementation quality. Spending the time and money to perform an audit utilizing these guidelines should be seen as a positive investment by facility?s executives as it will unquestionably assist in saving a lot of money and ensure business continuity by closing the gaps in PHA performance and reducing the chance for the ?check box? mentality, thus making their facilities, employees, community and assets safer...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the level of awareness among UTM staff towards <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> at the workplace. The respondents comprised of 319 academic and non-academic staff who work in faculties that use high risk equipment or substances, namely the Faculty of Education, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, and the Faculty of Chemical Engineering and Natural Resources. Questionnaires were used as the main instrument for obtaining data for this study. The data were analyzed descriptively based on frequency, percentage and mean in order to determine the level of awareness of the respondents towards <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>health.</b> To examine the relationship between demographic factors and respondents awareness towards <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>health,</b> the Pearson Correlation was used. The results showed that UTM staff had a high level of awareness of <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> based on their overall mean score of 3. 97. Aspects of the staffs level of awareness towards <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> that were studied were policy, procedure, equipment, training, Department of <b>Safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>Health</b> <b>and</b> commitment as well as environment. Further evaluation showed that the dominant factors that influenced the level of awareness of UTM staff with regards to <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> were training <b>and</b> policy. Findings also showed that demographic factors did not influence the level of awareness, whether directly or indirectly. The factors that were analyzed recorded a level of relationship of < 0. 20 and 0. 20 0. 40 only. This indicates a weak correlation. Finally, this study concludes that in order to raise the level of awareness towards <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>health,</b> the Universitys <b>administration</b> should increase the number of training programmes, <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> awareness campaigns, offer continuous or periodic <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> programmes <b>and</b> enforce the use of safety equipment by staff involved in high risk tasks...|$|R
40|$|Emergency {{responders}} may {{be exposed}} {{to a variety of}} fumes, gases, and particulates during the course of their job that can affect pulmonary function (PF) and require the use of respiratory protection. This investigation used occupational health monitoring examination data to characterize PF in a population currently employed as emergency responders. PF tests for workers who required health examinations to ensure fitness for continued respirator use were compared to the National <b>Health</b> <b>and</b> Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III Raw Spirometry database to determine if decreased PF was associated with employment as an emergency responder. The results of this research indicated that the emergency responders experienced a modest, but statistically significant, increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) mean values over the NHANES III population in both total and stratified analyses, including stratification by age, gender, height, and smoking history. Results are likely due to a combination of effectively controlled exposures in the workplace, and the healthy worker effect among long-term workers. PF testing required by the Occupational <b>and</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Administration</b> (OSHA) has substantial utility for conducting occupational surveillance at the population level. In this investigation, we were able to quickly evaluate if abnormal PF existed in an industrial sector known to have exposures that, when uncontrolled, can lead to PF impairment...|$|R
40|$|Major {{changes have}} {{occurred}} in the workplace in the past decades. Technology has changed dramatically, innovative ways of utilising nuclear power have been developed, new chemicals have been introduced to the market and the adverse effects of other chemicals on both human <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> the environment have been discovered. This has influenced the nature of the workforce itself. Regulators in the different jurisdictions were required to react to the challenges that these changes represent. This thesis explores the responses in the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the Republic of South Africa by identifying the occupational <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> (OSH) regulations, <b>administration,</b> enforcement and penalties which have been put in place to address the above mentioned challenges. It is impossible to mention all the changes in the workforce and workplace that {{have occurred in}} the recent years, and this thesis therefore focuses on the possibilities that different types of regulation offer to address some of these changes. Alterations to existing approaches are proposed to ensure that enforcement is improved and better targeted. The utilisation of third parties as surrogate regulators is also addressed. The central theme of this thesis is how the law can stimulate self-regulation by adopting a Safety Management System (SMS) within enterprises to encourage “self-critical reflection about their OHS performance”. The purpose of criminal sanctions in occupational <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>health</b> regulation, the role of the prosecution in the enforcement of OSH strategies and the possibility of combining prosecutions of corporations with prosecutions of individual managers and directors who are responsible for non-compliance with OSH standards are also addressed. Although it is most important to ensure that workers are not injured or do not contract occupational diseases, in practice this does unfortunately happen. Therefore this thesis also discusses the compensation of injured workers. Professor D. S. de Villier...|$|R
