40|$|Over {{the course}} of the 2005 and 2006 growing seasons, surveys were carried out in tomato fields in {{different}} parts of Greece {{in order to determine the}} occurrence and distribution of phytoplasma diseases of tomato, and to identify and classify the phytoplas-mas involved. In all the tomato cultivating areas, the percentage of plants with symptoms resembling phytoplasma infection ranged usually between 1 - 2 %, although in some cases it reached 70 - 80 %. The presence of phytoplasmas in these plants was veri-fied by PCR analysis with universal primers. Further analysis using group specific primers showed that mixed infections with phytoplasmas belonging to the aster yellows (16 SrI) or the stolbur (16 SrXII-A) group were very common, even in plants showing symptoms typical to either big bud or <b>stolbur</b> <b>disease.</b> Key words: tomato big bud; phytoplasma infection; tomato stolbur; PCR...|$|E
40|$|In Bulgaria stolbur is {{a disease}} of {{economic}} significance that affects pepper, eggplant, tomatoes, and potatoes. Stolbur is referred to the transmission diseases, i. e. the agent is being transferred via vector, namely cicada Hyalesthes obsoletus in this specific case. This research aims at following the <b>stolbur</b> <b>disease</b> of pepper {{of the variety of}} Sofiiska Kapiya. The experiment took place in 2010 and in 2011 on the experimental fields of the Agroecological Centre at the Agricultural University- Plovdiv. The occurence of Hyalesthes obsoletus was determined via visual observations of flower sticky traps (yellow, blue, and white). Route investigations were carried out for the purpose of tracking the symptoms of the disease. Reinforced migration of cicadas was established during the second ten days of July. It was established that the larger number of cicadas were reported for the yellow sticky traps, which may be recommended for practical application as a successful fight against cicada and limitation of its flight...|$|E
40|$|Phytoplasmas, biotrophic wall-less prokaryotes, only {{reside in}} sieve {{elements}} of their host plants. The essentials of the intimate interaction between phytoplasmas and their hosts are poorly understood, {{which calls for}} research on potential ultrastructural modifications. We investigated modifications of the sieve-element ultrastructure induced in tomato plants by ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma solani’, the pathogen associated with the <b>stolbur</b> <b>disease.</b> Phytoplasma infection induces a drastic re-organization of sieve-element substructures including changes in plasma membrane surface and distortion of the sieve-element reticulum. Observations of healthy and stolbur-diseased plants provided evidence {{for the emergence of}} structural links between sieve-element plasma membrane and phytoplasmas. One-sided actin aggregates on the phytoplasma surface also inferred a connection between phytoplasma and sieve-element cytoskeleton. Actin filaments displaced from the sieve-element mictoplasm {{to the surface of the}} phytoplasmas in infected sieve elements. Expression analysis revealed a decrease of actin and an increase of ER-resident chaperone luminal binding protein (BiP) in midribs of phytoplasma-infected plants. Collectively, the studies provided novel insights into ultrastructural responses of host sieve elements to phloem-restricted prokaryotes...|$|E
