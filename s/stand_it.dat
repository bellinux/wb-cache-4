Here, M.alcathoe is usually found in stands of plane or alder trees next to small streams in ravines.

5|$|The Main Stand is {{the oldest}} in Prenton Park, having been opened in December 1968. It is also the largest, with a {{capacity}} of 5,957. A two tier <b>stand,</b> <b>it</b> is generally divided into three main sections. The lower tier consists of the Bebington End paddock (capacity 1,150) and the Town End paddock (capacity 1,209), {{either side of the}} halfway line. The upper tier is simply referred to as the Main Stand (capacity 3,598).|$|E
5|$|To {{commemorate the}} 50th anniversary of Jeff Hall's death, the club {{commissioned}} a memorial clock {{to replace the}} original which did not survive the 1990s renovations. Placed centrally above the Main <b>Stand,</b> <b>it</b> was unveiled in September 2008 by Hall's teammates Alex Govan and Gil Merrick. However, adverse reaction to the clock's size and position provoked the club into ordering a larger replacement to be incorporated in a proposed big screen.|$|E
5|$|The main {{bus stand}} (popularly {{known as the}} New Bus Stand), opened in 2003, is located in Veinthaankulam and there is regular bus service {{to and from the}} city. Other bus stands (for {{intracity}} service) are the Junction and Palay bus stands. The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation has daily service to a number of cities, and the corporation operates a computerised reservation centre in the main bus <b>stand.</b> <b>It</b> also operates local buses serving the city and neighbouring villages. The State Express Transport Corporation has intercity service to Bangalore, Chennai, Kanyakumari and other cities.|$|E

5|$|The East Stand at Old Trafford was {{the second}} to be {{converted}} to a cantilever roof, following the Sir Alex Ferguson <b>Stand.</b> <b>It</b> is also {{commonly referred to as}} the Scoreboard End, as it was the location of the scoreboard. The East Stand can currently hold nearly 12,000fans, and is the location of both the disabled fans section and the away section; an experiment involving the relocation of away fans to the third tier of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand was conducted during the 2011–12 season, but the results of the experiments could not be ascertained in time to make the move permanent for the 2012–13 season. The disabled section provides for up to 170 fans, with free seats for carers. Old Trafford was formerly divided into sections, with each section sequentially assigned a letter of the alphabet. Although every section had a letter, it is the K Stand that is the most commonly referred to today. The K Stand fans were renowned for their vocal support for the club, and a large array of chants and songs, though many of them have relocated to the second tier of the West Stand.|$|E
5|$|The Jimmy McIlroy Stand is {{situated}} at {{the eastern side of}} the pitch and has a current capacity of 6,088. The upper tier of the stand is the designated family area at Turf Moor and like the James Hargreaves <b>Stand,</b> <b>it</b> has a number of corporate hospitality boxes. The Bob Lord Stand, which has a capacity of 3,036 fans, runs parallel with Harry Potts Way and houses the executive lounges as well as the Burnley Football Club trophy room. The stand was built in 1974 and was paid for in part by the sale of Martin Dobson to Everton. Named after Bob Lord, the former chairman of Burnley, the stand cost £480,000 was opened by Edward Heath, the Conservative Party leader at the time, a Burnley supporter, who had just been defeated as prime minister by Labour's Harold Wilson.|$|E
5|$|The Sir Alex Ferguson Stand, {{formerly}} known as the United Road stand and the North Stand, runs over the top of United Road. The stand is three tiers tall, and can hold about 26,000 spectators, the most of the four stands. It can also accommodate a few fans in executive boxes and hospitality suites. It opened in its current state in 1996, having previously been a single-tiered stand. As the ground's main <b>stand,</b> <b>it</b> houses many of the ground's more popular facilities, including the Red Café (a Manchester United theme restaurant/bar) and the Manchester United museum and trophy room. Originally opened in 1986 as {{the first of its kind}} in the world, the Manchester United museum was in the south-east corner of the ground until it moved to the redeveloped North Stand in 1998. The museum was opened by Pelé on 11 April 1998, since when numbers of visitors have jumped from 192,000 in 1998 to more than 300,000visitors in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Anfield was redeveloped at {{the start}} of the 1992–93 season {{following}} the recommendations of the Taylor report. A second tier was added to the Kemlyn Road stand, which included executive boxes and function suites as well as 11,000 seats. Renamed the Centenary <b>Stand,</b> <b>it</b> was officially opened on 1 September 1992 by Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) president Lennart Johansson. In the inaugural season of the Premier League, Liverpool again finished in sixth place, losing fifteen of their forty-two matches. They exited early in the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. In the 1993–94 season Liverpool won their first three games, but their form dipped as they lost four consecutive games. One positive was the emergence of striker Robbie Fowler from the club's youth team. He scored on his first-team debut against Fulham in the first leg of a League Cup tie, and scored all five goals in the return leg as Liverpool won 5–0. Liverpool continued to struggle during the season, culminating in a defeat to Bristol City in an FA Cup replay. Souness was sacked after the match and replaced by coach Roy Evans. The club ended the season in eighth place after losing sixteen of their games. Liverpool began to fall behind their rivals off the pitch. Manchester United made £93million after they were floated on the stock market, while Liverpool made £22million when media company Granada bought 9.9% of the club.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the Bill Struth Main Stand is the Sandy Jardine Stand {{formerly}} known as the Govan <b>Stand.</b> <b>It</b> is a two-tier stand, similar in style to the two end stands, which was completed in 1981. To the rear of the Govan Stand is the Argyle House extension, completed in 1990, which provides executive boxes, hospitality areas and office space. The Bar 72 area was added to the rear section of the Govan Stand in 2006. The Copland Road Stand, at the east end of the stadium, was completed in 1979 and now accommodates just over 8,000 fans. It is traditionally the 'Rangers end' of the ground and the team normally chooses to attack that end {{in the second half of}} matches. The western Broomloan Road Stand, which was completed in 1980, is identical to the opposite end. Although constructed as separate structures, the three stands have been linked since the mid-1990s, when two additional areas of seating were added to the corner areas. All of the stands are designed using the 'goalpost' structure, in which a large portal frame supports perpendicular beams on which roof cladding is secured. A Rangers Megastore is located in the corner between the Copland Road and Govan Stands.|$|E
5|$|The club crest depicts an ox above a {{representation}} of a ford to symbolise the location. It reflects the name {{and history of the}} city, as Oxford was originally a market town situated near to a ford on the River Isis, which was used by cattle. In 2008, a bronze statue of an ox was unveiled outside of what would have been the west <b>stand.</b> <b>It</b> was subsequently vandalised in January 2011, being covered in pink paint and the club used the opportunity to raise money for a breast cancer charity. The shape and design of the crest has changed numerous times since it was first produced. When playing as Headington and {{during the early years of}} Oxford United, the crest included a full ox crossing the ford, as well as the initials H.U.F.C. (pre-1962) or the name Oxford United (post name-change). Between 1972 and 1980, the crest became circular, showing just the ox's head on a yellow and black background. The words 'Oxford United Football Club' were placed around the ox. For the next 17 years, the crest was simply the ox's head coloured blue, with various combinations of wording surrounding it. For example, in the 1987–88 season, the wording 25th Anniversary was placed under the crest. In 1996, the crest had a shield shape and contained the ox's head over the ford, on a yellow background. This version was retained until the move to the Kassam Stadium in 2001, when club steward Rob Alderman designed the current version. It has a similar design to the preceding crest, but the ox and ford are contained in a circle with a yellow background, with the remainder of the crest being coloured blue.|$|E
