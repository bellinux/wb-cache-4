Being inexpensive, most common refrigerant brines are based on calcium chloride, sodium chloride and glycols.

Aqueous solutions (water solu-tions) have long been used as single phase (liquid only) secondary working fluids for cooling in supermarkets, ice rinks, heat recovery systems, heat pumps and other applications. However, aqueous solutions are increasingly used also for freezers in supermarkets and other applications in low temperature refrigeration. Of importance when comparing different secondary working fluids for indirect systems are the following basic thermophysical properties: freezing point, density, viscosity, specific heat, and thermal conductivity. Reliable data of these properties are needed to choose suitable fluid and to make technical calculations of an indirect refrigeration or heat pump system. The main intention of this work has been to select thermophysical property data with good or acceptable technical accuracy {{of a number of}} aqueous solutions that can be used by the refrigeration and heat pump industry, rather than focusing on a limited number of property values or scientifically very accurate measuring techniques. A thorough literature search was in view of this made to find the most reliable property values of aqueous solutions. Detailed literature references are given for thermo-physical properties of the following aqueous solutions, without other additives: Ethylene and propylene glycol, ethyl and methyl alcohol, glycerol, ammonia, potassium carbonate, calcium, lithium, magnesium and sodium chlorides as well as potassium acetate and potassium formate. Some laboratory measurements were made of most of the fluid types when literature values were incomplete or deemed unreliable. Methods used are briefly described and results are given. Much of the work was reported on in the Engineering Licentiate Thesis: Thermophysical properties of liquid <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerants,</b> A Critical Review on Literature References and Laboratory Measure-ments (Melinder 1998 a). That material forms the basis for the charts and tables used in the IIR-publication Thermophysical properties of liquid <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerants</b> (Melinder, 1997). The present thesis reports on an update made since 1998, including re-view work done on two additional fluids not covered in Melinder (1998 a). The thesis describes how the selection of property values results in tables and charts intended for the industry. Coefficients for poly-nomial equations are generated from these property values using a Matlab program and this material is intended as a useful tool for computer treatment. Aqueous solution of ethyl alcohol is used as example to see how this process is made. This choice of fluid can also be seen as a test of this method, as the basic thermophysical properties of aqueous solutions of ethyl alcohol present more chal-lenges than the other fluids examined. A comparison is made of a few types of aqueous solutions used as secondary working fluids for two types of applications. The first example is bedrock heat pumps and the second is cooling cabinets in a supermarket. An effort is made to see how the additive con-centration affects the thermal performance. Most aqueous solutions used as single-phase secondary fluids can also be used as ice slurry, a fluid consisting of liquid and ice where small ice crystals are produced, usually with some type of ice generator. The ice crystals are then transported to the cooling object from which heat is removed when ice crystals melt. This results in less temperature change in the cooling object and makes it also possible to reduce the volume flow rate and to use smaller pipe dimensions in the system. In order to choose a secondary fluid for ice slurry use and to make correct technical calculations of the ice slurry system {{there is a need to}} examine and evaluate thermo-physical properties and other aspects of ice and of the aqueous solution used.

40|$|An updraft tower {{cooling system}} is {{proposed}} to eliminate water use and utilize heat rejection in large-scale power plants. The updraft tower has an annular heat exchanger distributed around an inlet at the base; ambient air is drawn {{up through the}} tower chimney due to the density difference between the heated air at the base and the cooler air at the top. A secondary loop, configured as a vapor-compression cooling cycle, is used to transfer {{the heat from the}} power plant condenser to the tower base. Recuperative turbines in the tower harness the energy available in the waste heat air stream to assist in powering the secondary cooling cycle and increase the cooling system efficiency. The system feasibility is evaluated from thermodynamic perspective by comparing the net power needed to operate the system versus alternative dry cooling schemes. A detailed thermodynamic model coupling the power plant, secondary loop, and updraft tower systems is developed. Parametric studies involving changes in updraft tower geometry, heat exchanger size, and operating conditions are conducted to develop system design methodologies for optimized performance; water, R 134 a, R 600 a, and R 290 are evaluated as alternative <b>secondary</b> cooling cycle <b>refrigerants.</b> The size of the updraft tower is critical to the system performance. Increases in the tower diameter and height (up to reasonable construction limits) increase the system work output. The cooling system efficiency can be improved by lowering the secondary loop condensing temperature to reduce the compression work, but this requires a larger size tower to maintain the same heat rejection rate. Similarly, increasing the secondary loop evaporating temperature can reduce the compression work, but requires a larger heat exchange surface area. An optimum depth of the heat exchanger at the tower base (i. e., the secondary loop condenser) is identified that maximizes the work output. For an optimized system design, the required work input to the updraft tower cooling system is shown to be less than for a typical air-cooled condenser at the same heat rejection rate. By allowing the power plant condensing temperature to increase, a simple pumped loop can be used to replace the secondary vapor-compression cooling cycle as the secondary loop. With the same updraft tower parameters and heat exchangers design, the simulation model predicts the pumped loop provides better performance and consumes less power as compared to the vapor compression loop. With a tower height similar to existing water-cooled cooling towers, the updraft tower system with a pumped secondary loop can allow for dry cooling with significantly less efficiency penalty compared to air-cooled condensers. This work provides a framework for judgement of the updraft tower dry cooling system feasibility from a thermodynamic perspective. ...|$|R

In this research, applicability of some lower-price materials, i. e. mixture of vegetables oil and biodiesel, as phase change material in <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> were evaluated. Some thermal characteristics, such as freezing and melting temperatures, and also latent heat of the oils are explained in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{has been}} evaluated experimentally {{on the tube}} side of three different minichannel tubes, so-called multiport extruded (MPE) tubes, with different cross-section geometry. The objective was {{to find out which}} correlations, models, and relations should be used when predicting the performance of complete heat exchangers consisting of such tubes. The geometry of the tube channels or ducts was rectangular with different aspect ratios and one of the tubes was equipped with surface enlargements inside the channels. Evaluations were performed with four different <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> liquids: water, propylene glycol, Hycool 20, and Temper- 20. The laminar flow regime was the main focus of the investigations. Despite the shape of the minichannels, best agreement was found with a model presented by Gnielinski for laminar flow, developing temperature profile, and fully developed velocity profile in circular tubes with the constant wall temperature boundary condition...|$|E

The phase-change material is water stabilized by a tri-dimensional network of polymer, obtained {{by using a}} polymerizing process. The particle contains 90 per cent of water and has the consistency of a viscoelastic solid above the phase-change temperature. The measured values of the physical properties of the biphasic refrigerant, that is, specific heat, latent heat, density and viscosity, are presented and discussed for the considered temperature range. A supercooling phenomena is observed if {{the size of the}} particles becomes lower than 1 mm. The degree of supercooling however does not exceed 3 °C. The various advantages of this slurry are presented and the comparison with a common single-phase carrier fluid has proved how great its properties are as a <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerant.</b> This material appears well adapted {{for a wide variety of}} schemes where the production involves low-temperature intervals, such as the refrigeration industry...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAmong {{innovative}} processes {{developed in}} the field of refrigeration systems, technologies are encountered which are based on the application of Phase Change Materials (PCM) for the storage and transportation of energy. PCM are often provided by means of slurries. In the air-conditioning system presented here, a slurry of semi-clathrate hydrate crystals based on Tetra- n -Butyl-Ammonium Bromide (TBAB) is used as <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerant.</b> The production of the slurry can be smoothed over day and night. Upon storage, the slurry can be distributed to end users, and melted to recover the cooling capacity. By adaption of a standard refrigeration technology, it is at first demonstrated that an air-conditioning system can be established by replacing the standard refrigeration fluid by a slurry of TBAB based semi-clathrate hydrate. Furthermore, the study attempts to model the settling of particles within the storage tank, aiming at gaining some insight in their complex migration processes obtained during the production and distribution steps...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{object of}} this study is an {{internal}} heat transfer/external promote crystal small coil gas hydrate cool storage device. HCFC- 141 b hydrate is the cool storage medium, and water is <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerant.</b> This paper studies on the influence of different structural parameters on storage tank heat transfer characteristics, such as the coil arrangement and coil spacing. This paper builds nine tubes model. And it uses fluent to simulate the temperature field variation of the model. In order to make the research easier, this paper fixes other variables and studies for a variety in the course of studying. An analysis of the temperature variation of the four points was carried out. By comparing aligned arrangement and staggered arrangement, we can draw some conclusions. (1) Coil spacing has great influence on the heat transfer efficiency of cool storage tank. (2) The temperature variation of aligned arrangement is faster than staggered arrangement. And within a certain time, the final temperature of aligned arrangement is lower than staggered arrangement...|$|E
40|$|Ammonia is {{becoming}} more widely used in refrigeration systems due to the phasing out of CFCs and HCFCs. However, ammonia is a toxic gas and its leakage from refrigeration systems can lead to human exposure and contamination of refrigerated food stuffs. There {{is a lack of}} devices capable of the direct and continuous monitoring of leakage of ammonia into <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> systems. Here we demonstrate an ammonia measurement probe for continuous contact monitoring of secondary refrigerants. The probe was based on an ammonia-sensitive film of inkjet printed polyaniline nanoparticles deposited onto an interdigitated electrode array and enclosed behind a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane. When operated impedimetrically, the probe was capable of the detection of ammonia across the industrially relevant range of 0 to 100 ppm from + 4 to - 15 oC in water and brine. Operation of the probe as a simple threshold alarm without the requirement for temperature monitoring or calibration is illustrated...|$|E

Chiller {{is one of}} cooling system that used to cool liquid (brine or water) by using HCR- 22 refrigerant as the cooling medium and the brine serves as a <b>secondary</b> <b>refrigerant</b> to cooling the room indirectly. Standby mode is a cooling method without using ice or cooling methods from the chiller directly. In this study, the RAC with standby mode is done without cooling load so resulting in a performance with Coefficient of Performance average is 2. 46, Factor of Performance average is 3. 42, and Total of Performance average 5. 88.
