We exploit here the analytical solution, given by Sauter for the linearly rising potential step, {{to show that the}} tunnelling rate through a more realistic trapezoidal barrier is exponentially depressed, as soon as the length of the regions <b>supporting</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> exceeds the Compton wavelenght of the particle - the latter circumstance being hardly escapable in most realistic cases...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{consider}} an optimal design problem formulated on a two dimen-sional domain filled with two isotropic dielectric materials. The {{objective is to}} find <b>a</b> design that <b>supports</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> which {{is as close as}} possible to a target field, under a constraint on the amount of the better dielectric. In the case of a zero target field, the practical purpose of this problem is to avoid the so called dielectric breakdown of the material caused due to <b>a</b> relatively large <b>electric</b> <b>field.</b> In general, material layout problems of this type fail to have an optimal config-uration of the two materials. Instead one must study the behavior of minimizing sequences of configurations. From a practical perspective, optimal or nearly optimal configurations of the two materials are of special interest since they provide the in-formation needed for the manufacturing of optimal designs. Therefore in this work, we develop theoretical and numerical means to <b>support</b> <b>a</b> tractable method for the numerical computation of minimizing sequences of configurations and illustrate our approach through numerical examples...|$|R

40|$|We discuss new exact {{solutions}} of a three-parameter nonminimal Einstein-Maxwell model. The solutions describe static spherically symmetric {{objects with}} and without center, <b>supported</b> by <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> nonminimally coupled to gravity. We focus on a unique one-parameter model, which admits an exact solution for a traversable electrically charged wormhole connecting two universes, one asymptotically flat the other asymptotically de Sitter ones. The relation between the asymptotic mass and charge of the wormhole and its throat radius is analyzed. The wormhole solution found is thus a nonminimal realization {{of the idea of}} Wheeler about charge without charge and shows that, if the world is somehow nonminimal in the coupling of gravity to electromagnetism, then wormhole appearance, or perhaps construction, is possible.

40|$|We {{present a}} highly {{accurate}} {{tool for the}} simulation of shear Alfven waves (SAW) in collisionless plasma. SAW are important in space plasma environments because for small perpendicular scale lengths they can <b>support</b> <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> parallel to the ambient magnetic field. Electrons can be accelerated by the parallel <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> and these waves have been implicated {{as the source of}} vibrant auroral displays. However, the parallel <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> carried by SAW is small in comparison to the perpendicular <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> of the wave, making it difficult to measure directly in the laboratory, or by satellites in the near-Earth plasma environment. In this paper, we present a simulation code that provides a means to study in detail the SAW-particle interaction in both space and laboratory plasma. Using idealised, small-amplitude propagating waves with a single perpendicular wavenumber, the simulation code accurately reproduces the damping rates and parallel <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> amplitudes predicted by linear theory for varying temperatures and perpendicular scale lengths. We present a rigorous kinetic derivation of the parallel <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> strength for small-amplitude SAW and show that commonly-used inertial and kinetic approximations are valid except for where the ratio of thermal to Alfvén speed is between 0. 7 and 1. 0. We also present nonlinear simulations of large-amplitude waves and show that in cases of strong damping, the damping rates and parallel <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> strength deviate from linear predictions when wave energies are greater than only a few percent of the plasma kinetic energy, a situation which is often observed in the magnetosphere. The drift-kinetic code provides reliable, testable predictions of the parallel <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> strength which can be investigated directly in the laboratory, and will help {{to bridge the gap between}} studies of SAW in man-made and naturally occuring plasma...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} it is {{possible}} to construct a wide class of Lorentzian wormholes in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity with a stress energy which does not violate the weak or null energy condition. The wormholes exist in a certain region of the parameter space. In fact, it is shown that there is a critical value of a parameter defined in our work, below which we have wormholes. Above the critical value, we have a regular black hole spacetime. We put a restriction on the equation of state parameter α (p_θ=αρ) to have wormholes. We also put a lower limit on both the theory parameter |κ| and the throat radius, to restrict the tidal acceleration (at the throat) below one Earth gravity. As a special case of our general solution, we retrieve the wormhole <b>supported</b> by <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> for <b>a</b> charge-to-mass ratio greater than the critical value (Q/M) _c≈ 1. 144.

The paper deals with the behaviour of a single droplet laying on <b>a</b> solid <b>support</b> in <b>a</b> strong <b>electric</b> <b>field.</b> Inside the solid support two electrodes generate the <b>electric</b> <b>field.</b> Although the experiment is designed so that the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> is nearly homogeneous {{in the absence of}} a droplet, the remaining inhomogeneity motivates the discussion of its influence on the droplet. Therefore, water droplets at general positions on the experimental set-up are considered. The deformation of the droplet is calculated together with the total force acting on whole the droplet. The total horizontal force initiates the droplet to move. An analytical proof of the existence of a non-vanishing total force acting on an extended uncharged body in <b>a</b> general <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> is given. © 2004 IMACS.

40|$|This book {{presents}} {{the theory of}} gas discharge plasmas in a didactical way. It explains the processes in gas discharge plasmas. A gas discharge plasma is an ionized gas which is <b>supported</b> by <b>an</b> external <b>electric</b> <b>field.</b> Therefore its parameters are determined by processes in it. The properties of a gas discharge plasma depend on its gas component, types of external fields, their geometry and regimes of gas discharge. Fundamentals of a gas discharge plasma include elementary, radiative and transport processes which are included in its kinetics influence. They are represented in this book together with the analysis of simple gas discharges. These general principles are applied to stationary gas discharge plasmas of helium and argon. The analysis of such plasmas under certain conditions is theoretically determined by numerical plasma parameters for given regimes and conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of a conductive membrane in <b>a</b> static (DC) <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> is investigated theoretically. An effective zero-thickness model is constructed based on a Robin-type boundary condition for the electric potential at the membrane, originally developed for electrochemical systems. Within such a framework, corrections to the elastic moduli of the membrane are obtained, which arise from charge accumulation in the Debye layers due to capacitive effects and electric currents through the membrane {{and can lead to}} an undulation instability of the membrane. The fluid flow surrounding the membrane is also calculated, which clarifies issues regarding these flows sharing many similarities with flows produced by induced charge electro-osmosis (ICEO). Non-equilibrium steady states of the membrane and of the fluid can be effectively described by this method. It is both simpler, due to the zero thickness approximation which is widely used in the literature on fluid membranes, and more general than previous approaches. The predictions of this model are compared to recent experiments on <b>supported</b> membranes in <b>an</b> <b>electric</b> <b>field.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

Furthermore, the Coxeter exponents are either 2 or 3, but never ∞. We here go beyond subgroups of the Weyl group of E 10 (10) and classify all rank 10 Coxeter graphs with these properties. We find 21 distinct Coxeter groups of which 7 were already described in hep-th/ 0606123.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the electrical and charge collection {{characteristics of the}} updated second generation and third generation silicon-on-insulator (SOI) microdosimeter and its application to space and other areas. A microdosimeter is an important device {{used to measure the}} linear energy transfer (LET) distribution of radiation interacting with a biological system or electronics. It is important to have a good measure of the dose equivalent for medical and occupational safety purposes. The accurate measurement of the relative biological effect (RBE) of radiation field in these situations requires this portable microdosimeter device with a sensitive volume of the micron scale, equivalent to the size to a biological cell. The Centre for Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP) at the University of Wollongong (UOW) has previously developed a SOI device capable of measuring the pattern of energy deposited in small sensitive volumes (SV) of biological cell size. Despite good results being achieved with this device in clinical and radiation protection studies, further improved performance could be achieved via revision of the design. Together with its collaborative partners CMRP has developed the updated secondgeneration SOI microdosimeter on p-type high resistivity SOI with a 3 D cylindrical pn junction sensitive volume (SV), which reduces the chord length variance and <b>supports</b> <b>a</b> radial <b>electric</b> <b>field.</b> The surface above the region outside the SV is topped with an N+ guard electrode to reduce any collection of laterally diffused charge. Two designs were tested: one where a defined guard ring electrode surrounds each individual SV and another where the guard ring electrode is covering contiguously the regions between all SVs. Fabrication and preliminary testing of different versions of the device is being performed at the semiconductor nanofabrication facility at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and testing with ionising radiation is underway at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). Standard electrical characterisation techniques along with ion beam induced charge collection (IBIC) studies were used to assess the charge collection properties of the new devices. The I-V tests showed the properly functioning SVs of microdosimeters; additionally these devices were tested using alpha spectroscopy from Am- 241 source and on a heavy ion microbeam utilizing Ion Beam Induced Current (IBIC) studies. Results show that with both types of guard ring devices the SV maintains a well defined cylindrical geometry...|$|R
