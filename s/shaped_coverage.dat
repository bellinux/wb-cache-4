In comparison, ILS could only guide the aircraft down a single straight line, requiring controllers to distribute planes along that line. MLS allowed aircraft to approach from whatever direction they were already flying in, as opposed to flying to a parking orbit before [...] "capturing" [...] the ILS signal. This was particularly valuable at larger airports, as it could allow the aircraft to be separated horizontally much closer to the airport. Similarly in elevation, the fan <b>shaped</b> <b>coverage</b> allows for variations in descent rate, making MLS useful for aircraft with steeper approach angles such as helicopters, fighters and the space shuttle.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePrevious {{approaches}} to deformable model shape estimation and tracking have assumed a fixed class of shapes representation (e. g., deformable superquadrics), initialized prior to tracking. Since the <b>shape</b> <b>coverage</b> {{of the model}} is fixed, such approaches do not directly accommodate incremental representation discovery during tracking. As a result, model <b>shape</b> <b>coverage</b> is decoupled from tracking, thereby limiting both processes in terms of scope and robustness. We present a novel deformable model framework that accommodates the incremental incorporation during tracking of new geometric primitives (lines, in addition to points) that are not explicitly captured in the initial deformable model but that are moving consistently with its image motion. As these new features are detected via consistency checks, they {{are added to the}} model, providing incremental soft constraints on the estimation of its rigid parameters. The consistency checks are based on trilinear relationships between geometric primitives. Consequently, we not only increase both model scope and, ultimately, its higher-level <b>shape</b> <b>coverage,</b> but improve tracking robustness and accuracy, by directly employing the new features in both forward prediction and reconstruction. Our new formulation is a step towards automating model shape estimation and tracking, since it requires significantly reduced initial model hand-crafting. We demonstrate our approach on two separate image-based tracking domains, each involving complex 3 D object shape and motion...|$|R

Yet, despite the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) (commonly known as ‘Obamacare’) in 2010, the USA is not set to provide health care coverage to all, even if and when that reform is fully implemented. This article explores this issue by asking the following question: Why was a clear commitment to universal coverage, the norm in other industrialized countries, excluded as a core objective of the PPACA and how has post-enactment politics at both the federal and the state level further <b>shaped</b> <b>coverage</b> issues? The analysis traces the issue of universal coverage prior to the debate over the PPACA, during the 2008 presidential race, and during consideration of the bill. The article then looks at the post-enactment politics of coverage, with a particular focus on how states have responded to the planned use of the Medicaid programme to expand access to care. The article concludes by discussing how an explanation of the limits of the PPACA, in terms of both its commitment to universal coverage and, more importantly, the failure to provide comprehensive health insurance to all, requires an understanding of complex institutional and policy dynamics.

Parametric structure and motion estimation approaches usually assume a fixed class of shape representation (splines, deformable superquadrics, etc.) that are initialized prior to tracking.

We describe a parametric model-based tracking framework that supports the automatic detection and integration of geometric primitives (lines and points) incrementally during tracking.

Indeed, directivities above 34 dB {{can be obtained}} on different <b>shaped</b> <b>coverages</b> without too much complexity for the reflectarray design and with an interesting compactness gain compared to classical dual reflector antennas. Moreover, the number of cells can be limited to a value below 2000 thanks to the reflector whereas more elements would have been necessary with a single reflectarray. This reduction is an important fact for the active cells consumption and manufacture. Another interest of this solution is the versatility of the active reflectarray panel. Once the optimized phase shifts have been synthesized, the panel has just to be electronically driven. A combination of several elementary panels can also be foreseen for versatility and manufacture easiness, which is contributing to a cost reduction. Other works on this concept are currently led to improve the performances and to afford flexibility on more than two coverages with a reduced cell numbers...|$|R

In the past, line <b>shaped</b> contrail <b>coverage</b> has been parameterized {{relying on the}} scaling of contrail formation frequency to observed values. Coverage due to irregularly shaped contrail cirrus, that develop from line shaped contrails, could not be estimated with this method. We introduce a process-based parameterization of contrail cirrus in a global climate model that does not rely on scaling {{and that is not}} restricted to line shaped contrails. A new prognostic cloud class, contrail cirrus, is introduced that is allowed to develop in the parameterized, fractional ice supersaturated area. Initial dimensions of the contrails and a parameter controlling their spreading in a sheared flow are constrained by observational data. In an idealized experiment contrail cirrus coverage is found to be dominated by a major contrail outbreak and scales with supersaturation rather than contrail formation frequency. The global distribution of young contrail coverage is smoothed out due to transport but overall values are similar compared to older estimates. Interannual variability of young contrail coverage can be as large as the mean coverage. The sensitivity of the model simulations to physical model parameters and to parameters concerning the comparison with observational data is studied. The associated uncertainty of global line <b>shaped</b> contrail <b>coverage</b> can be as high as 60 % of the reference estimate (0. 05 %). The simulated coverage due to young contrails agrees reasonably well with most satellite observations of regional line <b>shaped</b> contrail <b>coverage</b> considering the sensitivity to the above parameters and the interannual variability...|$|R

40|$|Studies of {{political}} {{communication in the}} UK have focused primarily on election campaigns and reportage of parliamentary and public policy issues. In these contexts, two or more parties compete for coverage in the news media. However, the main British party conferences present a different context, where one party's activities form the (almost exclusive) focus of the news media's attention for a week, and that party's leadership 'negotiates' coverage in a direct one-to-one relationship. Conference weeks are the key points in the organizational year for each party (irrespective of their internal arrangements), and a critical period for communicating information about the party to voters at large, especially via television news coverage, which forms {{the focus of this}} study. The visual and audio impressions generated in the conference hall shape the way in which citizens not involved with that party perceive its organization, membership and policies. This thesis is the first specialized study of how TV news coverage of party conferences is shaped. Source-centred approaches to understanding the production of news focus on the activities of extra-media actors such as party elites in <b>shaping</b> <b>coverage.</b> Media-centred approaches substantially disagree, stressing the media elites' exercise of discretionary power or licensed autonomy in framing news. Party conference coverage reveals the activities of both party and media elites in an exceptionally clear and uncluttered form. Using qualitative interviews with party and media influentials, content analysis of TV news coverage and transcripts, direct observation of conferences and newsrooms, and collateral material from press coverage, historical material and other sources, this study explores the main stages in the production of news. Parties and media organizations both undertake detailed pre-planning for conference week, in the process negotiating key parameters which <b>shape</b> <b>coverage.</b> Journalistic news gathering activities shape the emergence of stories once the conference week begins. The parties have developed specialist teams to handle immediate news management, taking account of media strategies, but coverage can also be affected by internal dissent inside the parties, and by collective and individual responses among TV organizations. The production of conference news is symbiotic at many levels. The one-to-one character of party-media relations in conference weeks demonstrates clearly that broadcasting organisations exert a disciplinary effect upon political parties. Media pressures have fostered a degree of homogenization in parties' internal structures, and a certain standardization in their previously unique organizational cultures and modes of public self-presentation. Party conferences have come to look and sound similar, partly in response to the organizational demands of media professionals and the emergence of media-oriented party cadres. But access to TV news is also an increasingly effective tool for party leaderships to influence the internal debates and power struggles within the parties themselves...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that Latino young adults are uninsured at higher rates relative to other ethnoracial groups. Recent implementation of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) has increased access to health insurance for young adults, in part by maintaining health coverage through their parents until age 26. This paper examines patterns of Latino young adults' insurance coverage during early ACA implementation by addressing three questions: 1) To what extent do Latino young adults remain uninsured relative to their peers of other ethnoracial groups? 2) How do young adults' family socioeconomic background, immigrant characteristics, college enrollment, and employment status mediate their coverage? And, 3) do patterns of insurance coverage differ for employer-provided coverage versus other sources of coverage (including parents' health insurance) ? Using a 2011 representative sample of U.

The culturally loaded stories that journalists used to explain science, she suggested, reflected the norms of science journalism, a field that developed after 1945, partly in response to the importance of science and technology during the war. The notion of “facts over values” that shaped science also shaped journalism, and journalists were as invested in the sanctity of “objectivity” as any neophyte physics graduate student. Science, with its assumed reverence for facts, was therefore the model for proper journalism, and the reverence for facts “served the same purpose for journalists as it did for scientists, helping both professions maintain autonomy and independence from public control.” (87) Objectivity, of course, in journalism, generally meant adoring coverage of science and technology in terms of “cosmic breakthroughs” and “revolutionary developments.” ...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} greater news {{industry}} recognition {{in recent years}} that impartiality should not be translated into simply balancing the competing sides of a debate or issue. The binary nature of a referendum campaign represents a unique moment to consider whether broadcasters have put this into practice beyond routine political reporting. This study examines how impartiality was editorially interpreted in television news coverage during the United Kingdom’s 2016 European Union referendum. We carried out a systematic content analysis of the United Kingdom’s main evening bulletins over the 10 -week campaign, examining the issues and sources <b>shaping</b> <b>coverage,</b> as well as all the statistical claims made by campaign actors. Our aim was to critically examine how notions of impartiality were constructed and interpreted, exploring any operational limits and political consequences. Overall, we found that news bulletins maintained a fairly strict adherence to a central binary balance between issues and actors during the campaign. But this binary was politically inflected, with a significant imbalance in party political perspectives, presenting us with a right-wing rather than a left-wing case for European Union membership. We also found that independent expert analysis and testimony was sucked into the partisan binary between leave and remain campaigners, while journalists were reluctant to challenge or contextualise claims and counter-claims. Journalists were, in this sense, constrained by the operational definition of impartiality adopted by broadcasters. We argue for a more evidence-driven approach to impartiality, where journalists independently explore the veracity of campaign claims and have the editorial freedom to challenge them. We also suggest that the reliance on claims and counter-claims by leading Conservative politicians did little to advance public understanding of the European Union, and helped perpetuate a series of long-standing negative associations the British media have been reporting for many decades...|$|R
