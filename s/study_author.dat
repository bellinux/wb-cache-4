Our first survey recorded almost twice as many violent deaths from the 13th to the 18th months after the invasion as it did during the first 12. The second survey found an excess rate of 2.6/1000/year over the same period corresponding to approximately 70,000 deaths by April 2004. Thus, the rates of violent death recorded in the two survey groups are not so divergent." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of flame retardant chemicals at reducing the flammability of consumer products in house fires is disputed. Advocates for the flame retardant industry, {{such as the}} American Chemistry Council’s North American Flame Retardant Alliance, cite a study from the National Bureau of Standards indicating that a room filled with flame-retarded products (a polyurethane foam-padded chair and several other objects, including cabinetry and electronics) offered a 15-fold greater time window for occupants to escape the room than a similar room free of flame retardants. However, critics of this position, including the lead <b>study</b> <b>author,</b> argue that the levels of flame retardant used in the 1988 study, while found commercially, are {{much higher than the}} levels required by TB 117 and used broadly in the United States in upholstered furniture.|$|E
5000|$|Dance {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} shown to positively impact a person's mental health. For example, lead <b>study</b> <b>author</b> Anna Duberg, of Sweden's Center for Health Care Sciences, found that, [...] "despite {{problems such as}} stress and other potential challenges in being an adolescent girl, dance can result in high adherence and a positive experience for the participants." [...] Dancing {{had the potential to}} contribute to new healthy habits. Swedish researchers, writing in the JAMA Pediatrics, studied 112 teenage girls who were struggling with problems including neck and back pain, stress, anxiety, and depression. Half of the girls attended weekly dance classes, while the other half didn't. The girls who took the dance classes improved their mental health and reported a boost in mood—positive effects that lasted up to eight months after the classes ended.|$|E
5000|$|This {{suggests}} that, {{rather than}} arising in East Africa around 200,000 years ago, modern humans {{may already have}} been present across the length of Africa 100,000 years earlier. According to <b>study</b> <b>author</b> Jean-Jacques Hublin, [...] "The idea is that early Homo sapiens dispersed around the continent and elements of human modernity appeared in different places, and so different parts of Africa contributed {{to the emergence of}} what we call modern humans today." [...] Early humans may have comprised a large, interbreeding population dispersed across Africa whose spread was facilitated by a wetter climate that created a [...] "green Sahara", around 330,000 to 300,000 years ago. The rise of modern humans may thus have taken place on a continental scale rather than being confined to a particular corner of Africa.|$|E
