5|$|The raven's breast {{is marked}} by Beta Corvi, a <b>star</b> <b>of</b> {{magnitude}} 2.7 located 146 ± 1 light-years from Earth. Roughly 206 million years old and 3.7 ± 1 times as massive as the Sun, it has exhausted its core hydrogen and expanded and cooled to a surface temperature of around 5,100K {{and is now a}} yellow bright giant <b>star</b> <b>of</b> spectral type G5II. It likely spent most of its existence as a blue-white main sequence <b>star</b> <b>of</b> spectral type B7V. Bearing the proper name of Minkar and marking the raven's nostril is Epsilon Corvi, located some 318 ± 5 light-years from Earth. It is a red giant of spectral type K2III that is around 54 times the Sun's radius and 930 times its luminosity. Around 4 times as massive as the Sun, it spent much of its life as a main-sequence <b>star</b> <b>of</b> spectral type B5V. Lying to the south of the quadrilateral between Beta and Epsilon Corvi is the orange-hued 6 Corvi, an ageing giant <b>star</b> <b>of</b> spectral type K1III that is around 70 times as luminous as the Sun.
