40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of large trim and heel angles of the wrecked submarine, the double spherical shell {{rotating}} docking <b>skirt</b> is studied. According to the working principle of the rotating docking <b>skirt,</b> and the fixed <b>skirt,</b> the directional <b>skirt,</b> the angle <b>skirt</b> are simplified as the connecting rod. Therefore, the posture equation and kinematics model of the docking <b>skirt</b> are deduced, and according to the kinematics model, the angle of rotation of the directional <b>skirt</b> and the angle <b>skirt</b> is obtained when the wrecked submarine is in different trim and heel angles. Through the directional <b>skirt</b> and angle <b>skirt</b> with the matching rotation can make docking <b>skirt</b> interface in the 0 °~ 2 γ range within the rotation, to complete the docking <b>skirt</b> and the wrecked submarine docking. The MATLAB software is used to visualize the rotation angle of fixed <b>skirt</b> and directional <b>skirt,</b> which lays a good foundation for the development of the control of the double spherical shell rotating docking <b>skirt</b> in future...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- <b>Skirted</b> {{foundation}} {{is one in}} which vertical or inclined wall surrounds one or more sides of the soil mass beneath the footing. <b>Skirted</b> {{foundation is}} an alternative approach required for improving the bearing capacity of raft foundation by using “structural <b>skirts</b> ” fixed to the edges of the raft foundation. Construction of vertical <b>skirts</b> {{at the base of the}} raft foundation confines the underlying soil and generates a soil resistance on <b>skirt</b> side that helps the footing to resist sliding. The present work focused on the analysis of two sided and one sided <b>skirted</b> raft with and without vertical <b>skirt</b> using a finite element software PLAXIS 2 D. The studied parameters include the raft sizes,skirt depth and then compared with those of raft without vertical <b>skirt.</b> The results indicated that using structual <b>skirts</b> for raft foundation has a significant effect in improving the bearing capacity. This improvement increases with the <b>skirt</b> depth with varying raft sizes for two sided raft foundation vertical <b>skirt</b> with decrease in settlement. Whereas in one sided raft foundation with vertical <b>skirt</b> there is increase in both bearing capacity and settlement. Thus finite element analysis presented in this study helped in better understanding and identifying the failure pattern of <b>skirted</b> raft with and without <b>skirt</b> for raft foundation with vertical <b>skirt...</b>|$|R

This is to celebrate the history of the area as Pen-Y-Cog is the original name for Penicuik. These buses were de-branded in 2014 due to high fuel consumption of the B7TL's used and the 37/47/X37 is now worked by standards liveries Volvo B9TL's.|$|E

40|$|Shape {{factors of}} a tight <b>skirt</b> and 3 kinds of flared <b>skirts</b> were {{investigated}} precisely.

In the case of tight <b>skirt,</b> flare- 1 <b>skirt</b> and flare- 2 <b>skirt,</b> the shape factor showed high correlation with drape parameters of the <b>skirts</b> and circular fabrics.

5|$|Maintaining {{its peak}} {{intensity}} {{for over a}} day, the hurricane gradually slowed its forward motion and weakened. By September13, Debbie's motion became influenced by the Westerlies, causing the system to accelerate east-northeastward. The system passed over the western Azores as a minimal hurricane on September15. At this point, there is uncertainty as {{to the structure of}} Debbie, whether it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone or maintained its identity as a tropical system. Regardless of which took place, the system deepened as it neared Ireland, <b>skirting</b> the coast of Western Ireland on September16. Shortly thereafter, the system was confirmed to have become extratropical as it continued towards the northeast.

5|$|A compact cyclone, Fred quickly {{reached its}} peak {{strength}} as a hurricane, with a minimum central pressure of 986mbar (hPa; 29.12inHg) and 85mph (140km/h) winds. Through the rest of August31, the hurricane traversed the Barlavento Islands of Cape Verde, barely <b>skirting</b> the southern coast of Boa Vista around 12:00UC. Gradually decreasing in definition, the eye passed north of São Nicolau and then north-northeast of Santo Antão over the next 12hours. On September1, drier air and stronger wind shear aloft dispersed the convection around the cyclone's core, causing Fred to diminish to a tropical storm. The weakened storm turned slightly toward the west-northwest, over considerably cooler waters, in response to high pressure rebuilding to its north. Through much of September14, Fred produced limited convective activity, with intermittent flares of thunderstorms that were continuously blown away from the center by the strong upper winds. Despite the adverse environment and the storm's lack of stable convection, Fred maintained a robust spiral of low-level clouds and gales during this period, defying the NHC's repeated forecasts of its dissipation.|$|E
50|$|Fender <b>skirts</b> {{were often}} paired with whitewall tires.

For example, up until 1976, the Chevrolet Caprice, Oldsmobile 98, Buick Electra, Pontiac Bonneville and the Cadillac Fleetwood, DeVille and Calais models used fender <b>skirts.</b> The Cadillac Eldorado models sported fender <b>skirts</b> from 1971 thru 1974.

5|$|Hurricane Belle was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} cyclone that caused moderate damage across the East Coast of the United States in August1976. In late July, a tropical wave emerged off {{the west coast of}} Africa. Traversing the Atlantic Ocean for more than a week, the system eventually consolidated into a tropical depression near the Bahamas on August6. Remaining nearly stationary for a day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August7 and a hurricane later that day as it acquired a northwest motion. Formation of an eye accompanied quick intensification and Belle reached its peak the following day with winds of 120mph (195km/h). The hurricane subsequently turned north and accelerated, <b>skirting</b> the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Early on August10, Belle made landfall on Long Island, New York, as a minimal hurricane crossing Long Island Sound and hitting the central coast of Connecticut as strong tropical storm. Thereafter, Belle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New England before moving over Atlantic Canada. The system turned east while over the north Atlantic and ultimately dissipated on August15 to the south of Iceland.|$|E
