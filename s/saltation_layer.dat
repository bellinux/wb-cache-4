40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} model is developed to simulate bed-load transport using Distinct Element Method (DEM). The model describes the bed-load transport as dynamically interdependent motions of individual sediment particles under the flow action. A steady logarithmic velocity distribution over the flow depth {{is considered to}} represent fluid motion, while turbulent intensities are also included within the closure model. The present model accounts for both fluid-particle and particle-particle interactions, which are the predominant micro-mechanisms of bed-load transport under low and high tractive forces, respectively. Characteristic features of bed-load transport, previously reported by experimental observations, are numerically reproduced. The concept of vertical momentum transfer is exploited to describe features of concurrently present of <b>saltation</b> and sheet-flow <b>layers.</b> It is concluded that the vertical motion of particles is not significantly active in sheet-flow layer and the particle momentum is preserved.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} a systematic experimental and numerical {{study on the}} interactions among porous fence, airflow, and windblown snowdrifts, a knowledge that will contribute to optimize the performance of porous wind shielding system in Cold Regions. A comprehensive review of the concepts, theories, techniques, and key findings associated with the research work has been undertaken. The key technical parameters influencing fence performance have been systematically studied by means of wind tunnel experimental investigations and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. The study has found that porosity is the most influential structural parameter affecting the performance of porous fences in many aspects. Fence height stands a significant positive position {{in terms of its}} performance. It was found that fence performance is not sensitive to the changes of approaching atmospheric airflow velocity. Nevertheless, a bottom gap can improve snow fence trap efficiency. All of those findings agree with most of the findings of other researchers, which affirms that the research methodology adopted in this research is sound. Physical experimental work was performed to assess the reliability and credibility of the numerical models. Those models have been intentionally simplified, which made them easier to construct and quicker to obtain numerical solutions at a lower computational cost. Furthermore, the numerical models demonstrate the level of competence acquired through this research that is implemented in the optimisation of fence design. Special {{attention has been paid to}} the issues where elaborate research work has not been systematically reached in the open literature, this includes areas such as the effects of arrangement of porous holes, fence surface shear, and directions of wind load with respect to the fence, etc. Correlation between the reattachment length, the shelter distance, and the creation and distribution of fence surface shear is reported, to the author???s knowledge, for the first time in the open literature. General guidelines for the design of shelters based on porous fences have been established through this study. For example, the desirable size of hole range should be identified beforehand, and porous holes with sharp angular corners should usually be avoided in the fence design. It is recommended to place the fence within an angle of 30 ?? to the wind load, where the effective shelter distance can be estimated in a linearized equation, and the normal drag coefficient can be described as a function of cos 2 ??. Optimal design of the arrangement of porous holes will maximize the fence performance, especially when the close fence environment is of concern. Although the definition of fence effective zone is still vague in the research field, the key factors influencing the fence effective zone have been investigated by evaluating the reduction of wind velocity leeward of the fence in this thesis. It is found that the fence effective zone is not sensitive to the change of approaching airflow velocity, and that increasing fence height will increase the physical size of the fence effective zone, but not in a proportional manner. It is also concluded that fence effective zone will be significantly reduced when the non-normal wind load is inclined at an angle greater than 30 ?? to the fence. The effective zone increases effectively when the fence porosity is optimal. In contrast to the majority of published research work, the transient snow transport model presented in this work considers the snow transport rate as a whole without distinguishing the rate in <b>saltation</b> and suspension <b>layer.</b> The numerical study indicated that the position of the snow crest is mainly determined by the fence height, while porosity and bottom gap mainly affect the downwind deposition length. The optimal porosity for snow fences is in the range of 0. 4 to 0. 5, which is greater than the one for wind fences, which lies in the range from 0. 25 to 0. 35. Two snow crests have been observed leeward the fence at the onset of snow deposition, when the fence was placed without a bottom gap to the snow ground. This finding has not been encountered in any of the reported research work. Wind tunnel simulations of snowdrift around the fences have marginally under-predicted the sizes of snow deposition. The numerical predictions were quantitatively and qualitatively in good agreement with the field observations. This incompetence of wind tunnel experiments on porous fences implies that numerical modelling can play a more important role in snow fence research...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} the intermittency of the aeolian saltation, a saltation model, forced with instantaneous velocity fields, has been introduced in a Large Eddy Simulation airflow model. The coupled model is evaluated on a flat erodible surface under various wind conditions and soil particle-size distribution. It is first shown that the model is able to simulate a well-developed <b>saltation</b> <b>layer</b> in equilibrium with the turbulent flow. The main characteristics of the <b>saltation</b> <b>layer</b> and their sensitivity to wind conditions are in good agreement with previous data set. Then, the saltation intermittency is visualized through the presence of blowing sand structures near the surface, known as aeolian streamers. This {{is the first time}} that such structures are reproduced numerically. From a correlation analysis, we confirm previous thoughts that these sand structures are a visual footprint of past turbulent eddies propagating in the surface boundary layer. The streamers appear to be embedded in larger saltation structures with increasing wind conditions. The spatial scales of these streamers change with wind conditions and soil particle-size distribution. This is explained by two mechanisms: (1) the modification of eddy structures with the main characteristics of the <b>saltation</b> <b>layer,</b> and (2) the reduction of saltating particle sensitivity to the near-surface eddies with increasing wind condition and soil median particle diameter, as the eddy lifetime decreases within the <b>saltation</b> <b>layer</b> and the particle response time increases, respectively.

40|$|Investigations of wind-field {{modification}} due to {{the presence}} of saltating sediments have relied heavily on wind tunnels, which are known to impose geometric constraints on full boundary layer development. There remains great uncertainty as to which portion of the vertical wind-speed profile to analyze when deriving estimates of shear velocity or surface roughness length because the lower sections are modified to varying degree by saltation, whereas the upper segments may be altered by artificially induced wake-like effects. Thus, it is not obvious which of several alternative velocity-profile parameterizations (e. g., Law of the Wall, Velocity Defect Law, Wake Law) should be employed under such circumstances. A series of experimental wind-tunnel runs was conducted across a range of wind speed using fine- and coarse-grained sand to collect high-quality, fine-resolution data within and above the <b>saltation</b> <b>layer</b> using thermal anemometry and ruggedized probes. After each run, the rippled bottom was fixed with fine mist, and the experiment repeated without saltation. The measured wind-speed profiles were analyzed using six different approaches to derive estimates of shear velocity and roughness length. The results were compared to parameter estimates derived directly from sediment transport rate measurements, and on this basis, it is suggested that one of the six approaches is more robust than the others. Specifically, the best estimate of shear velocity during saltation is provided by the logarithmic law applied to the profile data within about 0. 05 m of the bottom, despite the fact that this near-surface region is where profile modification by saltating sediments is most pronounced. Uncertainty remains as to whether this conclusion can be generalized to field situations because progressive downwind adjustments in the interrelationship between the <b>saltation</b> <b>layer</b> and the wind field are anticipated in wind tunnels, thereby confounding most analyses based on equilibrium assumptions. © 2003 Elsevier B.

These results support the assumption of constant particle speeds in recent models predicting linear scaling of saltation flux with shear stress. In contrast, our results refute widely used older models that assume that particle speed increases with shear velocity, thereby predicting nonlinear 3 / 2 stress-flux scaling. This conclusion is further supported by direct field measurements of saltation flux versus shear stress.

The coupled differential equations for the average density and velocity of sand in the <b>saltation</b> <b>layer</b> reproduce both known equilibrium relations for the sand flux and the time evolution of the sand flux as predicted by microscopic saltation models. The three phenomenological parameters of the model are a reference height for the grain-air interaction, an effective restitution coefficient for the grain-bed interaction, and a multiplication factor characterizing the chain reaction caused by the impacts leading to a typical time or length scale of the saturation transients. We determine the values of these parameters by comparing our model with wind tunnel measurements. Our main interest are out of equilibrium situations where saturation transients are important, for instance at phase boundaries (ground/sand) or under unsteady wind conditions. We point out that saturation transients are indispensable for a proper description of sand flux over structured terrain, by applying the model to the windward side of an isolated dune, thereby resolving recently reported discrepancies between field measurements and theoretical predictions.

An approach isdeveloped here in which the problem is cast in the frequency domain using the particle momentum equation which balances grain inertia against resultant steady and acceleration related fluid forces. A transport gain function is defined which relates the normalized transport spectrum to the normalized, turbulent flow spectrum. Experiments are reported in which the gain function was determined using a hot wire anemometer and a new pin impact probe to make high-frequency measurements of the velocity and sand transport profiles within the <b>saltation</b> <b>layer</b> in a small laboratory wind tunnel. The results were subjected to frequency analysis and the corresponding wind and transport spectra were obtained.

A cross-shore transect of ultrasonic distance sensors was deployed across the backshore and seaward face of a recovering blowout and foredune at Padre Island National Seashore, Texas to demonstrate the ability of these sensors to measure bed elevation change in aeolian environments. Measuring bed elevation at 1. min intervals over 500. h reveals episodic and dramatic changes in bed elevation in response to both onshore and offshore winds. Consistent with pre- and post-surveys, the change in bed elevation ranged from a couple of centimeters at the majority of station to over 26. cm near the foredune crest. Bed elevation change exhibited a weak covariance along the instrumented transect and wavelet analysis reveals a transition from high-frequency changes (every 12 - 40. h) in the backshore to low-frequency changes (every 120. h) along the seaward face of the foredune.

Over the recent years two avalanche paths are used to release small to medium avalanches 3 or 4 times each winter. Avalanche flows are generally dense, whether wet or dry, sometimes with a powder part. Main path n° 2 (track length 800 m) is dedi-cated to avalanche dynamics. Within the flow of the avalanche, flow height and vertical profiles of pressure and velocity are measured along a 3. 5 m tripod. The snow volume released in the starting zone is quantified by a differential analysis of laser scanning measurements set before and after trig-gering. A high rate positioning of the avalanche along the track is determined from terrestrial oblique photogrammetry. Above the dense layer, the <b>saltation</b> <b>layer</b> and the powder part are characterized by particles and air fluxes measurements. In path n° 1 smaller in size, medium-size avalanches (track length 500 m) make this track of particular interest for experiments on structures.

Consequently, {{there have been many}} devices developed, tested, and applied to investigate a range of aeolian-based phenomena. However, determining the most effective application and data analysis techniques is widely debated in the literature. Here we investigate the effectiveness of two different sediment traps (the BEST trap and the MWAC catcher) in measuring vertical sediment flux. The study was performed in a wind tunnel with sediment fluxes characterized using saltiphones. Contrary to most studies, we used the analogue output of five saltiphones mounted {{on top of each other}} to determine the total kinetic energy, which was then used to calculate aeolian sediment budgets. Absolute sediment losses during the experiments were determined using a balance located beneath the test tray. Test runs were conducted with different sand sizes and at different wind speeds.

The model needs a set of input parameters including fall velocity, threshold shear velocity, shear velocity, mass concentration and roughness, which are obtained from empirical formulae and wind speed measured at a given height. To better determine the required field data in an alpine context, our experimental site, Col du Lac Blanc (2700 ma. s. l.), French Alps, was first equipped with one anemometer and blowing-snow acoustic sensors, which proved not to be accurate enough for research purposes in the current state of development even though a new calibration curve was used. We therefore set up a Snow Particle Counter and we returned to the traditional, robust mechanical traps and a 10 m mast with six anemometers, two temperature sensors and a depth sensor to better determine friction velocity and aerodynamic roughness. Based on the studied drifting-snow events we conclude: (1) the proportionality of the aerodynamic roughness to the square of the friction velocity was confirmed, but with a varying proportionality ratio depending on the snowdrift event; (2) values of σsUF were relatively well approximated by empirical formulae from data originating from Antarctica, and (3) snowdrift concentration profiles obtained by Pomeroy's semi-empirical formulae for the <b>saltation</b> <b>layer</b> coupled with a theoretical approach for the diffusion layer overestimated the concentration profiles for the studied blowing-snow event...|$|E

40|$|The first size-resolved {{airborne}} {{measurements of}} dust fluxes {{and the first}} dust flux measurements from the central Sahara are presented and compared with a parameterization by Kok (2011 a). High-frequency measurements of dust size distribution were obtained from 0. 16 to 300 µm diameter, and eddy covariance fluxes were derived. This {{is more than an}} order of magnitude larger size range than previous flux estimates. Links to surface emission are provided by analysis of particle drift velocities. Number flux is described by a − 2 power law between 1 and 144 µm diameter, significantly larger than the 12 µm upper limit suggested by Kok (2011 a). For small particles, the deviation from a power law varies with terrain type and the large size cutoff is correlated with atmospheric vertical turbulent kinetic energy, suggesting control by vertical transport rather than emission processes. The measured mass flux mode is in the range 30 – 100 µm. The turbulent scales important for dust flux are from 0. 1 km to 1 – 10 km. The upper scale increases during the morning as boundary layer depth and eddy size increase. All locations where large dust fluxes were measured had large topographical variations. These features are often linked with highly erodible surface features, such as wadis or dunes. We also hypothesize that upslope flow and flow separation over such features enhance the dust flux by transporting large particles out of the <b>saltation</b> <b>layer.</b> The tendency to locate surface flux measurements in open, flat terrain means these favored dust sources have been neglected in previous studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] co-ordinated European research project Wind Erosion and Loss of SOil Nutrients in semiarid Spain (WELSONS) {{was carried out}} from 1996 to 1999 to understand and predict the potential impacts of land-use change and management on soil degradation by wind erosion on agricultural land in Central Aragon, a semiarid desertification-threatened region in NE Spain. This paper gives {{a description of the}} project's experimental approach and an overview of the main results regarding the effects of agricultural practices (i. e. conventional, CT, versus reduced tillage, RT) on surface conditions affecting wind erosion, the mobilisation of soil particles in the <b>saltation</b> <b>layer</b> and the atmospheric emission of fine dust into the suspension layer. The characterisation of the soil surface showed that soil erodibility by wind under RT was lower than that under CT. Though strong Cierzo wind events occurred during the experimental period, only a limited amount of material was available for wind erosion mainly due to soil crusting, a common feature in the area. In spite of this, saltation transport flux was measured at CT plots for different erosion episodes. Also, significant vertical emission of dust was observed only in the CT plot. Finally, the sandblasting efficiency calculated in the present experiment could be interpreted {{as the result of a}} higher binding energy for the particles of the silt loam experimental soil compared to soils with a lighter texture. This work was funded by the European Commission, DG XII, Environment and Climate Programme, under contract no ENV 4 -CT 95 - 0182. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|To improve dust {{emission}} schemes in large scale transport models, we developed the first physically-based model simulating the full erosion {{process in a}} turbulent flow by resolving explicitly saltating particle trajectories and dust suspension, in presence of vegetation. The large-eddy simulation technic is used here to simulate the turbulent flow, allowing to solve explicitly the main wind gusts near the surface and so the intermittency of the erosion process. The model appeared able to reproduce the saltation intermittency as visualized through the presence of blowing sand structures near the surface, known as aeolian streamers observed on beaches during windy days. In presence of vegetation, the model further allowed us to investigate the sensitivity of sand erosion to the arrangement and morphology of plants (shrubs versus trees). More recently, we further used the model to reanalyze the dependence of the size distribution of the dust flux to the wind speed for idealized erosion events starting from an air free of dust. We found that the suspension of small dust (around 1 μm) can be a long nonstationary process (several hours depending on the wind intensity) due to the low deposition velocity of this particle size range. This leads to a continuous enrichment of the near-surface dust flux in small particles, enrichment that is enhanced with wind intensity, independently of the possible role of saltators. The model also showed that the size distribution and magnitude of dust fluxes at a few meters height {{differ from those of}} the emitted flux at the surface as particles start to be sorted through the deposition process within the <b>saltation</b> <b>layer.</b> This last result should be considered when evaluating or calibrating “physically based” {{dust emission}} schemes against measured near-surface turbulent diffusive dust fluxes...|$|E
40|$|The Lautaret {{full-scale}} avalanche {{test site}} in the southern French Alps {{has been used by}} IRSTEA (Cemagref) Research Institute since 1973. Over the recent years two avalanche paths are used to release small to medium avalanches 3 or 4 times each winter. Avalanche flows are generally dense, whether wet or dry, sometimes with a powder part. Main path n° 2 (track length 800 m) is dedicated to avalanche dynamics. Within the flow of the avalanche, flow height and vertical profiles of pressure and velocity are measured along a 3. 5 m tripod. The snow volume released in the starting zone is quantified by a differential analysis of laser scanning measurements set before and after triggering. A high rate positioning of the avalanche along the track is determined from terrestrial oblique photogrammetry. Above the dense layer, the <b>saltation</b> <b>layer</b> and the powder part are characterized by particles and air fluxes measurements. In path n° 1 smaller in size, medium-size avalanches (track length 500 m) make this track of particular interest for experiments on structures. A macroscopic sensor-structure is set nearly 150 m downhill from the starting zone, that is, in the area where avalanches generally reach their maximum velocity. It consists is a one square-meter plate supported by a 3. 5 m high steel cantilever fixed in the ground, facing the avalanche. Impact pressures are reconstructed from the cantilever deformations, while avalanche velocity is measured from optical sensors. Seismic signals generated by avalanches of those 2 paths are recorded by a 3 -axial broadband seismometer. Around those experimental devices dedicated to the understanding of avalanche physics, a national and international partnership has been developed from years to years, including INSA de Lyon, CNRS and Université Joseph Fourier (France), Aalto University (Finland), Nagoya University (Japan), Boku University (Austria), IGEMA (Bolivia), OGS (Italy...|$|E
40|$|Most {{granular}} flows at {{environmental conditions}} are unsteady and exhibit a complex physical behavior. Dune formation and migration {{in the desert}} are controlled {{not only by the}} flow of saltating particles over the sand bed, but also by turbulent atmospheric airflow. In fact, sediments are transported by the atmospheric airflow within a thin layer only a few centimeters above the sandy surface. These jumping particles reach a maximum sediment mass flux level at a certain delay time (known as the “saturation time”) after the initial movement by sliding and rolling begins. Unlike sediment transport in water where the particles are lifted by the turbulent suspension, the saltating particles are kept alive in the layer mainly due to particle-particle and particle-bed collisions. In order to model this Aeolian transport of sand, Jenkins and Pasini [1] proposed a two-fluid model (one-dimensional and steady state) using Granular Kinetic Theory (GKT) to describe the solid-phase stress. The present work extends the original idea of Jenkins and Pasini [1] by using a more robust model of GKT for the kinetic/collisional contributions to the solid-phase stress tensor, together with a friction model activated for sustained contacts between particles. In addition, a standard k-ε turbulence model for the air and a drag model for the interaction between the phases are employed. A rectangular 2 D geometry was chosen with a logarithmic profile for the inlet air velocity, along with an initial amount of sand at rest in {{the lower part of the}} simulation domain, resembling the particle saltating flow commonly seen in the vertical middle plane within saltation wind tunnels. This model is validated with experimental data from Liu and Dong [2] and the results given by Pasini and Jenkins [1]. A good estimation for the particle erosion and mass flux in the <b>saltation</b> <b>layer</b> is predicted, even though the profiles of mass flux and concentration within the transport layer are very thin and lowe...|$|E
