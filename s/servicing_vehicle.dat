40|$|Abstract. On-orbit service (OOS) {{system based}} on Orbital <b>Servicing</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (OSV) is a complex giant system which needs an overall {{planning}} according {{to the analysis of}} its components and demands. Accordingly in this article, the target spacecrafts of the OOS system and their demands are firstly analyzed based on their function design and orbital location. Then the servicing mission is divided into 3 aspects including service, maintenance and assembly. The mission types and effectiveness are clarified as well. Finally, the components and their mutual relationship of OSV-cored OOS system are elaborated considering the future development. The plan proposed in this paper will make a good reference for the overall design of OOS system. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} service {{satellites}} {{has thus far}} been limited to low earth orbit platforms within reach of the Space Shuttle. Other orbits, such as geosynchronous orbits containing high-value spacecraft have not been attainable by a <b>servicing</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The useful life of a satellite can be extended by replacing spent propellant and damaged orbital replacement units, forestalling the need for eventual replacement. This growing need for satellite on-orbits servicing can be met by the Manned On-Orbit Servicing Equipment (MOOSE). Missions requiring orbit transfer capability, precision manipulation and maneuvering, and man-in-the-loop control can be accomplished using MOOSE. MOOSE is a flexible, reusable, single operator, aerobraking spacecraft designed to refuel, repair, and service orbiting spacecraft.

40|$|The amenability of {{satellites}} to on-orbit servicing (OOS) is assessed {{through the}} development of an agent-based model. With the context of a multi-year servicing campaign in the GEO (geosynchronous orbit) belt, OOS is treated as a multi-variable optimization problem with the principal trade of minimizing both ∆V (change in velocity) expenditures and transfer time. Assuming current launch vehicle, propulsion, and robotic technology for servicing vehicles, the focus in the model is on the serviceability of target satellites. <b>Servicing</b> <b>vehicle</b> operations are simulated over time, completing maneuvers as a function of pathdependent servicing operations. Primary outputs of the agent model are the cost of servicing (mean ∆V expenditure by <b>servicing</b> <b>vehicle</b> for satisfying tickets) and the performance of target satellites (availability for mission operations). Many interesting lessons emerged from the agent-based model of OOS with implications for both serviceability assessments of target satellites and servicing provider architecture. Most fundamentally, the high availability of GEO satellites in the model suggests that satellites work too well to stress a simple OOS system. Servicing vehicles were idle more than 90 % of the time leading to a probability of two or more servicing vehicles conducting missions simultaneously of less than 1 %. OOS business models need to balance the attraction of GEO due to the high concentration of valuable spacecraft and friendly orbital dynamics with the high-reliability of GEO satellites launched over the past two decades.

40|$|The {{purpose is}} to {{determine}} the potential for servicing from the Space Shuttle Orbiter and to assess NASA's role as the catalyst in bringing about routine on-orbit servicing. Specifically this study seeks to determine what requirements, in terms of both funds and time, are needed to make the Shuttle Orbiter not only a transporter of spacecraft but a <b>servicing</b> <b>vehicle</b> for those spacecraft as well. The scope of this effort is to focus on the near term development of a generic servicing capability. To make this capability truly generic and attractive requires that the customer's point of veiw be taken and transformed into a widely usable set of hardware. And to maintain a near term advent of this capability requires that a minimal reliance be made on advanced technology. With this background and scope, this study will proceed through three general phases to arrive at the desired program costs and schedule. The first step will be to determine the servicing requirements of the user community. This will provide the basis for the second phase which is to develop hardware concepts to meet these needs. Finally, a cost estimate will be made for each of the new hardware concepts and a phased hardware development plan will be established for the acquisition of these items based on the inputs obtained from the user community...|$|E
40|$|Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) are bowling-ball sized spherical satellites. They {{will be used}} {{inside the}} space station to test a set of {{well-defined}} instructions for spacecraft performing autonomous rendezvous and docking maneuvers. Three free-flying spheres will fly within the cabin of the station, performing flight formations. Each satellite is self-contained with power, propulsion, computers and navigation equipment. The results are important for satellite <b>servicing,</b> <b>vehicle</b> assembly and formation flying spacecraft configurations. SPHERES is a testbed for formation flying by satellites, the theories and calculations that coordinate the motion of multiple bodies maneuvering in microgravity. To achieve this inside the ISS cabin, bowling-ball-sized spheres perform various maneuvers (or protocols), with one to three spheres operating simultaneously. The Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) experiment will test relative attitude control and station-keeping between satellites, re-targeting and image plane filling maneuvers, collision avoidance and fuel balancing algorithms, {{and an array of}} geometry estimators used in various missions. SPHERES consists of three self-contained satellites, which are 18 sided polyhedrons that are 0. 2 meter in diameter and weigh 3. 5 kilograms. Each satellite contains an internal propulsion system, power, avionics, software, communications, and metrology subsystems. The propulsion system uses CO 2, which is expelled through the thrusters. SPHERES satellites are powered by AA batteries. The metrology subsystem provides real-time position and attitude information. To simulate ground station-keeping, a laptop will be used to transmit navigational data and formation flying algorithms. Once these data are uploaded, the satellites will perform autonomously and hold the formation until a new command is given...|$|E

40|$|Space {{robotics}} has {{a substantial}} interest in achieving on-orbit satellite servicing operations autonomously, e. g. rendezvous and docking/berthing (RVD) with customer and malfunctioning satellites. An on-orbit <b>servicing</b> <b>vehicle</b> requires {{the ability to}} estimate the position and attitude in situations whenever the targets are uncooperative. Such situation comes up when the target is damaged. In this context, this work presents a robust autonomous pose system applied to RVD missions. Our approach is based on computer vision, using a single camera and some previous knowledge of the target, i. e. the customer spacecraft. A rendezvous analysis mission tool for autonomous service satellite has been developed and presented, for far maneuvers, e. g. distance above 1 km from the target, and close maneuvers. The far operations consist of orbit transfer using the Lambert formulation. The close operations include the inspection phase (during which the pose estimation is computed) and the final approach phase. Our approach {{is based on the}} Lambert problem for far maneuvers and the Hill equations are used to simulate and analyze the approaching and final trajectory between target and chase during the last phase of the rendezvous operation. A method for optimally estimating the relative orientation and position between camera system and target is presented in detail. The target is modelled as an assembly of points. The pose of the target is represented by dual quaternion in order to develop a simple quadratic error function {{in such a way that}} the pose estimation task becomes a least square minimization problem. The problem of pose is solved and some methods of non-linear square optimization (Newton, NewtonÃ¢Â�Â�Gauss, and LevenbergÃ¢Â�Â�Marquard) are compared and discussed in terms of accuracy and computational cost...|$|E
40|$|Space Telerobotics research, {{performed}} {{under contract}} to the European Space Agency (ESA), concerning the execution of human factors experiments, and ultimately leading {{to the development of}} a telerobotics test bed, has been carried out since 1985 by a British Consortium consisting of British Aerospace, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and, more recently, the UK National Advanced Robotics Research Centre. The principal aim of the first study of the series was to derive preliminary requirements for a teleoperation servicing system, with reference to two mission model scenarios. The first scenario introduced the problem of communications time delays, and their likely effect on the ground-based operator in control of a manipulator system on board an unmanned <b>servicing</b> <b>vehicle</b> in Low Earth Orbit. In the second scenario, the operator was located on the NASA Orbiter aft flight deck, supervising the control of a prototype manipulator in the 'servicing' of an experimental payload in the cargo bay area. Human factors analyses centered on defining the requirements for the teleoperator workstation, such as identifying basic ergonomic requirements for workstation and panel layouts, defining teleoperation strategies, developing alphanumeric and graphic screen formats for the supervision or direct control of the manipulator, and the potential applications of expert system technology. The second study for ESA involved an experimental appraisal of some of the important issues highlighted in the first study, for which relevant human factors data did not exist. Of central importance during the second study was the issue of communications time delays and their effect on the manual control of a teleoperated manipulator from a ground-based command and control station...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{field of}} on-orbit {{servicing}} of space systems {{has been studied}} extensively, and techniques for performing satellite resupply and repair functions have been developed in detail. They are covered extensively in the literature. Based on this background, Microcosm has performed design studies, partly under NASA/MSFC contract, of a small-size, 300 kg-class multi-function Orbital Transfer Vehicle (OTV) that can provide servicing and resupply functions for the International Space Station (ISS). It carries the required payload from a launch vehicle upper stage to the Station, and after berthing it supports servicing activities of the ISS crew members. The vehicle has a payload-carrying capability of 350 kg. The current design includes grappling fixtures specifically designed for ISS berthing which can be eliminated for servicing other satellites. The very strict safety requirements involving ISS access were {{taken into account in}} the <b>servicing</b> <b>vehicle</b> design. Repeated ISS servicing sorties to be performed by the OTV are of particular interest, to meet tight revisiting schedules. Extended reuse of the same OTV, once in orbit, allows substantial launch and operational cost savings. Propellant requirements for the servicing sorties are very modest, allowing an extended on-orbit life of this vehicle, with at least 3, but more likely 6 to 8 ISS revisits. The OTV discussed here can be utilized for low-cost servicing of other spacecraft as well. The paper discusses the vehicle’s maneuver sequences and propellant requirements, and describes its design features and its interactions with the ISS. The OTV’s total recurring cost is estimated at less than $ 35 Million. It would nominally be carried by a light-lift launcher, such as Microcosm’s planned Sprite vehicle, at a projected cost of the order of $ 2. 5 Million...|$|E

40|$|The {{international}} space community has long recognized {{the potential benefits}} of servicing and refueling satellites on orbit. However, technological and economic factors have posed obstacles to the servicing of satellites on a commercial basis. This situation may soon change. Several commercial entities could be developing capabilities that will enable cost-efficient in-space servicing and refueling in ways previously thought unfeasible. For example, in the spring of 2011, two commercial space actors, MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA) and Intelsat, announced plans to develop a commercial <b>servicing</b> <b>vehicle</b> and took steps in this direction. Other commercial players have also announced servicing programs. These companies' plans have the potential to revolutionize the economics of satellite manufacturing and operations and to affect related industries, including space launch and insurance. Commercial servicing capabilities will co-evolve with their policy, legal, and regulatory environment. Plans announced by companies such as MDA and Intelsat are only among the first to raise concrete policy considerations for decisions makers in national governments and international fora. Others are prepared to follow. Commercial servicing for the first time presents itself as a pressing policy issue in several countries. The policy choices of national governments, acting either individually or in concert, will determine whether a commercial servicing industry develops. Policy choices will also affect whether and how easily an emergent satellite servicing industry could evolve to provide new services for new customers. This is important because funding new markets for commercial servicers could prove critical to sustaining this budding industry in the long term. Factoring these possible evolutions into policy responses today will ensure that policy environments are supportive of applying industry's servicing capabilities toward other ends in the future. This paper begins by describing what is commercial on-orbit servicing and its potential to serve goals beyond the servicing and refueling of communications satellites. It then examines recent and proposed efforts at developing commercial servicing capabilities from technical and business perspectives. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we discuss the national and international policy choices that will shape whether and how a viable commercial servicing industry develops and whether and how it could pursue other business opportunities. Among the new opportunities we consider are space debris removal services for governments and international consortia. This paper is based on original research, including interviews with servicing experts in government, industry, and academia in Canada, Germany, and the United States. ...|$|E
