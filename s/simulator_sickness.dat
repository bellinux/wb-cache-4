50|$|Simulation sickness, or <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness,</b> is a {{condition}} where a person exhibits symptoms similar to motion sickness caused by playing computer/simulation/video games (Oculus Rift is working to solve <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> {{can also}} have post-training effects that can {{compromise}} safety after the simulator session, such as when the pilots drive away from the facility or fly while experiencing symptoms of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness.</b>|$|E
40|$|From {{a survey}} of ten U. S. Navy flight {{simulators}} a large number (N > 1, 600 exposures) of self-reports of motion sickness symptomatology were obtained. Using these data, scoring algorithms were derived, which permit examination of groups of individuals that can be scored either for 1) their total sickness experience in a particular device; or, 2) according to three separable symptom clusters which emerged from a Factor Analysis. Scores from this total score {{are found to be}} proportional to other global motion sickness symptom checklist scores with which they correlate (r = 0. 82). The factors that surfaced from the analysis include clusters of symptoms referable as nausea, oculomotor disturbances, and disorientation (N, 0, and D). The factor scores may have utility in differentiating the source of symptoms in different devices. The present chapter describes our experience with the use of both of these types of scores and illustrates their use with examples from flight <b>simulators,</b> space <b>sickness</b> and virtual environments...|$|R
50|$|Another trigger {{of virtual}} reality {{sickness}} is when there is disparity in apparent motion between the visual and vestibular stimuli. Essentially what happens {{is there is a}} disagreement between what the stimuli from the eyes send to the brain and what the stimuli from the inner ear are sending to the brain. This is what is essentially at the heart of both <b>simulator</b> and motion <b>sickness.</b> In virtual reality, the eyes transmit that the person is running and jumping through a dimension, however, the ears transmit that no movement is occurring and that the body is sitting still. Since there is this discord between the eyes and the ears, a form of motion sickness can occur.|$|R
50|$|The {{physiology}} behind VR sickness is {{not currently}} clearly understood. Fortunately, research has uncovered some clear indications of certain conditions that cause VR sickness. It {{seems that the}} images projected from virtual reality {{have a major impact}} on sickness. The refresh rate of on-screen images is often not high enough when VR sickness occurs. Because the refresh rate is slower than what the brain processes, it causes a discord between the processing rate and the refresh rate, which causes the user to perceive glitches on the screen. When these two components do match up, it can cause the user to experience the same feelings as <b>simulator</b> and motion <b>sickness</b> which is mentioned below.|$|R
5000|$|Two main {{theories}} exist {{about the}} causes of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness.</b> [...] The first is sensory conflict theory. Optical flow patterns generated in virtual environments typically induces perception of self-motion (i.e., vection). Sensory conflict theory holds that, when this perception of self-motion is not corroborated by inertial forces transmitted through the vestibular system, <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> is likely to occur. Thus, sensory conflict theory predicts that keeping the visual and vestibular inputs in agreement can reduce the likelihood of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> experienced by users. Additionally, according to this theory, people who do not have a functioning vestibular component of their nervous system should not show either <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> or motion sickness.|$|E

5000|$|Currently, {{there are}} very few {{theories}} as to why virtual reality sickness in particular occurs; however, it is closely related to <b>simulator</b> and motion <b>sickness.</b> Sensory conflict theory provides a framework for understanding motion sickness; however, it can be applied to virtual reality sickness to better understand how it can occur, and is commonly used for that purpose. [...] Sensory conflict theory posits that sickness will occur when a user's perception of self-motion is based on incongruent sensory inputs from the visual system, vestibular system, and non-vestibular proprioceptors, and particularly so when these inputs are at odds with the user's expectation based on prior experience. [...] Applying this theory to virtual reality, sickness can be minimized when the sensory inputs inducing self-motion are in agreement with one another.|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether susceptibility to motion sickness provoked by unexpected movement {{is associated with}} susceptibility to visually induced motion sickness in migraine sufferers. Migraine sufferers are unusually susceptible to motion sickness, but the mechanism of this susceptibility is not well understood. Possibilities include vestibular dysfunction secondary to vasomotor disturbances during migraine attacks, hyperexcitability of brainstem circuits that produce symptoms of motion sickness and migraine, and heightened susceptibility to visual illusions of movement. A motion sickness susceptibility questionnaire that listed common triggers of motion sickness was filled out by 42 migraine sufferers and 39 headache-free controls of similar age and sex distribution to migraine sufferers. A greater proportion of migraine sufferers than controls reported that traveling in cars and buses, reading in the car, using playground equipment, watching wide-screen movies and movement <b>simulators,</b> induced motion <b>sickness.</b> However, visually induced motion sickness appeared to be independent of motion sickness to most movement-related stimuli in migraine sufferers. The lack of association between susceptibility to movement-induced and visually induced motion sickness implies {{that more than one}} mechanism increases susceptibility to motion sickness in migraine sufferers...|$|R
40|$|Space Motion Sickness (SMS) is {{commonly}} experienced by astronauts and often requires treatment with medications during early flight days of space missions. Orally administered scopolamine {{is commonly}} used by astronauts to prevent SMS. Bioavailability of oral (PO) SMS medications is often low and highly variable. Intranasal (IN) administration of medications achieves higher and more reliable bioavailability than from an equivalent PO dose. Methods: To test the safety and reliability of INSCOP, two clinical studies were performed, a dose escalation study and a comparison study administering INSCOP during normal ambulation and head down tilt bedrest. Efficacy was evaluated by testing INSCOP with two, different motion sickness inducing paradigms. Results: Preliminary results indicate that INSCOP demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics and a low side effect profile. In head down tilt bedrest, relative bioavailability of INSCOP was increased for females at both doses (0. 2 and 0. 4 mg) and for males at the higher dose (0. 4 mg) but is reduced at the lower dose (0. 2 mg) compared to normal ambulation. INSCOP displays gender specific differences during ABR. One of the treatment efficacy trials conducted at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center demonstrated that INSCOP is efficacious at both doses (0. 2 and 0. 4 mg) in suppressing motion sickness symptoms as indicated by longer chair ride times with INSCOP administration than with placebo, and efficacy increases with dose. Similar results were seen using another motion <b>sickness</b> <b>simulator,</b> the motion simulator dome, at the Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory, with significantly increased time in the dome in motion-susceptible subjects when using INSCOP compared to untreated controls. Conclusion: Higher bioavailability, linear pharmacokinetics, a low incidence of side effects, and a favorable efficacy profile make INSCOP a desirable formulation for prophylactic and rescue treatment of astronauts in space and military personnel on duty...|$|R
50|$|The second {{theory for}} <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> {{identifies}} postural instability as the determinant of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness.</b> This theory notes that situations producing <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> are denoted by their unfamiliarity to the participant {{more than the}} degree of sensory conflict; for example, sea sickness is, for many, a transient problem that is solved with experience to being on a ship. Thus, the novelty of the motion cues is hypothesized to lead to an inability to maintain postural control and this lack of control causes <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> until the participant adapts. Key attributes here include the notation that the motions causing <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> are in a nauseogenic low frequency range that overlaps with the frequency of motion within the human body as it maintains control over its posture. Experiments have measured markers of the onset of postural instability, {{and found that it}} precedes signs and symptoms of simulator sickness.At present, it is accurate to say that both—and neither—of these theories are yet adequate to fully explain and predict <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness.</b> Although it is clear which types of pilots are affected by it, and both sensory conflict theory and postural instability theory relate its onset with certain physiological conflicts, neither theory suffices to predict why these specific conflicts (vision vs. vestibular on the one hand, posture vs. control on the other) elicit sickness in the subject. Additional possibilities for elicitation of motion sickness in general (including <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness)</b> include gaze destabilization, which is disrupted if the vestibuloocular reflex gain in the nervous system is altered, moving patterns of visual stimuli, and motions that stimulate the otoliths and semicircular canals of the inner ear. It is unclear whether or not these stimuli are encountered in significant amounts in a simulator to induce sickness in the expert pilots. However, since laboratory studies have shown the removal of the vestibular projection areas of the cerebellum (in laboratory animals) to result in insusceptibility to motion sickness, it is almost certainly probable that the first of these theories holds the most promise with regard to research into the direct physiological causes of the phenomenon.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Simulator</b> <b>{{sickness}}</b> is {{a subset}} of motion sickness that is typically experienced by pilots who undergo training for {{extended periods of time}} in flight simulators. Due to the spatial limitations imposed on these simulators, perceived discrepancies between the motion of the simulator and that of the vehicle can occur and lead to simulator sickness.It is similar to motion sickness in many ways, but occurs in simulated environments and can be induced without actual motion. Symptoms of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> include discomfort, apathy, drowsiness, disorientation, fatigue, vomiting, and many more.These symptoms can reduce the effectiveness of simulators in flight training and result in systematic consequences such as decreased simulator use, compromised training, ground safety, and flight safety. Pilots are less likely to want to repeat the experience in a simulator if they have suffered from <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> and hence can reduce the number of potential users. It can also compromise training in two safety-critical ways: ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1989, the US Army {{released}} a report detailing {{the results of a}} study examining <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> in UH-60 Blackhawk flight simulators, confirming the above hypothesis. [...] The report also found that longer periods between sessions of flight simulation training resulted in greater probability of detrimental symptoms appearing increased.Research suggests that this is the body's natural way of adjusting to these systems. The bodies of experienced pilots have adapted to different types of motion experienced during actual flight conditions. When placed into a flight simulator, visual and other stimuli cause their bodies to expect the same motions associated with actual flight conditions. But their bodies instead experience the imperfect motion of the simulator, resulting in sickness.A similar situation can arise for pilots who have long gaps between simulator uses. During simulation training, the body will eventually adapt to the environment to diminish the effects of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness.</b> However, when long periods of time are spent outside of the simulator, the body is not able to adequately adapt and symptoms will reappear.Often, adaptation is the single most effective solution to <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness.</b> For most individuals, adaptation can occur within only a few sessions, with only a minority of individuals (3-5 percent) never being able to adapt. This adaptation occurs within the psyche of the individual with repeated, controlled exposures, without any required alteration to the simulator. Through incremental exposures, dispersed regularly over a series of days, adaptation can occur faster than that of an abrupt all-encompassing exposure. However, following adaptation to the novel simulator motion environment, <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> symptoms can reoccur with a return to the former environment. For this reason, <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> is commonly referred to as a phenomenon of maladaptation sickness, due to incessant conflict between current and past environmental conditions. [...] In flight training, this phenomenon can be a safety concern where it may lead to motion sickness hindering pilot performance in the real aircraft following flight simulator training.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{unwanted}} symptoms {{have been caused}} by prolonged use of virtual reality, and these may have slowed proliferation of the technology. Virtual reality sickness (also known as cybersickness) occurs when a person's exposure to a virtual environment causes symptoms that are similar to motion sickness symptoms. [...] The most common symptoms are general discomfort, headache, stomach awareness, nausea, vomiting, pallor, sweating, fatigue, drowsiness, disorientation, and apathy. [...] Other symptoms include postural instability and retching. [...] Virtual reality sickness is different from motion sickness in that it can be caused by the visually induced perception of self-motion; real self-motion is not needed. [...] It is also different from simulator sickness; non-virtual reality <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> tends to be characterized by oculomotor disturbances, whereas virtual reality sickness tends to be characterized by disorientation. A 2016 publication assessed the effects of exposure to 2D vs 3D dissection videos on nine pathology resident physicians, using self-reported physiologic symptoms. Watching the content in 3D vs 2D did not increase <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness.</b> Although the average <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> questionnaire score did increase with time, statistical analysis does not suggest significance.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Simulator</b> <b>Sickness</b> Questionnaire (SSQ) is {{currently}} the standard for measuring <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness.</b> The SSQ was developed based upon 1,119 pairs of pre-exposure/post-exposure scores from data that were collected and reported earlier. [...] These {{data were collected from}} 10 Navy flight simulators representing both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. The simulators selected were both 6-DOF motion and fixed-base models, and also represented a variety of visual display technologies. The SSQ was developed and validated with data from pilots who reported to simulator training healthy and fit.The SSQ is a self-report symptom checklist. It includes 16 symptoms that are associated with <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness.</b> Participants indicate the level of severity of the 16 symptoms that they are experiencing currently. For each of the 16 symptoms there are four levels of severity (none, slight, moderate, severe). The SSQ provides a Total Severity score as well as scores for three subscales (Nausea, Oculomotor, and Disorientation). The Total Severity score is a composite created from the three subscales. It is the best single measure because it provides an index of the overall symptoms. The three subscales provide diagnostic information about particular symptom categories: ...|$|E
50|$|This {{is a brief}} {{drive that}} {{comprises}} several minutes of the Country Vigilance Scenario. The purpose of this drive is to provide an introductory experience for the participant and {{to determine if they}} are likely to experience <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> when using the driving simulator.|$|E
5000|$|Though human-piloted {{aviation}} {{has existed}} {{since the early}} 20th century, <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> did not arise as an issue for pilots until much later when the first fixed-base simulators were created. Bell Aircraft Corporation created a helicopter simulator for the Navy during the 1950s, and it was found [...] "that {{a large number of}} observers (mostly helicopter pilots) experienced some degree of vertigo during these demonstrations". Navy psychologists performed further study on the pilots who participated in these simulator exercises, and found that 28 out of 36 respondents to their evaluations experienced sickness. Additionally, psychologists found that experienced flight instructors seemed to be most susceptible. In fact, 60% of the instructors reported <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> symptoms compared to only 12% of the students. [...] "The SS usually occurred in the first ten minutes of a training session and frequently lasted for several hours afterward." ...|$|E
50|$|While {{anyone can}} {{experience}} <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness,</b> studies in flight simulators {{have found a}} correlation between the appearance of symptoms and the flight experience of the pilot. Studies conducted independently by the US Navy, US Coast Guard, and US Army during the 1980s all came to the same conclusion: the greater experience of the pilot, higher the likelihood of sickness symptoms during simulation training exercises.|$|E
50|$|Along with <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness,</b> {{additional}} symptoms {{have been}} observed after exposure to motion simulation. These symptoms include feelings of warmth, pallor and sweating, depression and apathy, headache and fullness of head, drowsiness and fatigue, difficulty focusing eyes, eye strain, blurred vision, burping, difficulty concentrating, and visual flashbacks. Lingering effects of these symptoms were observed to sometimes last up to {{a day or two}} after exposure to the motion simulator.|$|E

50|$|Motion or {{simulator}} sickness: Simulators work by “tricking” {{the mind}} {{into believing that}} the inputs it is receiving from visual, vestibular and proprioceptive inputs are {{a specific type of}} desired motion. When any of the cues received by the brain do not correlate with the others, motion sickness can occur. In principle, <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> is simply a form of motion sickness that can result from discrepancies between the cues from the three physical source inputs. For example, riding on a ship with no windows sends a cue that the body is accelerating and rotating in various directions from the vestibular system, but the visual system sees no motion since the room is moving {{in the same manner as}} the occupant. In this situation, many would feel motion sickness.|$|E
5000|$|Virtual reality {{sickness}} {{may have}} undesirable consequences beyond the sickness itself. For example, Crowley (1987) argued that flight <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> could discourage pilots from using flight simulators, reduce {{the efficiency of}} training through distraction and the encouragement of adaptive behaviors that are unfavorable for performance, compromise ground safety or flight safety when sick and disoriented pilots leave the simulator. [...] Similar consequences could be expected for virtual reality systems. Although the evidence for performance decrements due to virtual reality sickness is limited, research does suggest that virtual reality sickness is a major barrier to using virtual reality, indicating that virtual reality sickness may be a barrier to the effective use of training tools and rehabilitation tools in virtual reality. Estimates of the multi-study incidence and main symptoms of virtual reality sickness (also called cybersickness) have been made.|$|E
5000|$|Importance of Motion and Visual Latencies. In {{simulators}} {{with both}} visual and motion systems, {{it is particularly}} important that the latency of the motion system not be greater than of the visual system, or symptoms of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> may result. This is because in the real world, motion cues are those of acceleration and are quickly transmitted to the brain, typically in less than 50 milliseconds; this is followed some milliseconds later by a perception {{of change in the}} visual scene. The visual scene change is essentially one of change of perspective and/or displacement of objects such as the horizon, which takes some time to build up to discernible amounts after the initial acceleration which caused the displacement. A simulator should therefore reflect the real-world situation by ensuring that the motion latency is equal to or less than that of the visual system and not the other way round.|$|E
50|$|Several factors {{contribute}} to simulation sickness, which can be categorized into human variables, simulator usage, and equipment. Common human variable factors include susceptibility, flight hours, fitness, and medication/drugs. An individual’s variance in susceptibility to motion sickness is a dominant contributing factor to <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness.</b> Increasing flight hours is also an issue for pilots as they become more accustomed to the actual motion in a vehicle. Contributing factors due to simulator usage are adaptation, distorted or complicated scene content, longer simulation length, and freeze/reset. Freeze/reset refers to the starting or ending points of a simulation, which should be as close to steady and level conditions as possible. Clearly, if a simulation is ended {{in the middle of}} an extreme maneuver then the test subjects IMU system is likely to be distorted. Simulator equipment factors that {{contribute to}} motion sickness are quality of motion system, quality of visual system, off-axis viewing, poorly aligned optics, flicker, and delay/mismatch between visual and motion systems. The delay/mismatch issue has historically been a concern in simulator technology, where time lag between pilot input and the visual and motion systems can cause confusion and generally decrease simulator performance.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are various}} {{technical}} aspects of virtual reality that can induce sickness, such as mismatched motion, field of view, motion parallax, and viewing angle. [...] Additionally, {{the amount of time}} spent in virtual reality can increase the presence of symptoms. Mismatched motion can be defined as a discrepancy between the motion of the simulation and the motion that the user expects. [...] It is possible to induce motion sickness in virtual reality when the frequencies of mismatched motion are similar to those for motion sickness in reality, such as seasickness. [...] These frequencies can be experimentally manipulated, but also have the propensity to arise from system errors.Generally, increasing the field of view increases incidence of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> symptoms. This relationship has been shown to be curvilinear, with symptoms approaching an asymptote for fields of view above 140°.Altering motion parallax distances to those less than the distance between the human eyes in large multiple-screen simulation setups can induce oculomotor distress, such as headaches, eyestrain, and blurred vision. [...] There are fewer reports of oculomotor distress on smaller screens; however, most simulation setups with motion parallax effects can still induce eyestrain, fatigue, and general discomfort over time.Viewing angle has been shown to increase a user's sickness symptoms, especially at extreme angles. [...] One example of such an extreme angle would be when a user must look downwards a short distance in front of their virtual feet. As opposed to a forward viewing angle, an extreme downward angle such as this has been shown to markedly increase sickness in virtual environments.Time spent immersed in a virtual environment contributes to sickness symptom presence due to the increasing effects of fatigue on the user. [...] Oculomotor symptoms are the most common to occur due to immersion time, but the nature of the user's movements (e.g., whole-body vs. head-only) is suggested to be the primary cause of nausea or physical sickness.|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} overview {{deals with}} <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness,</b> for example, why it occurs, the symptoms, and what measures can alleviate the symptoms. Image systems which extend {{a long way}} sideways, 90 º turns and rapid changes of speed are examples of factors which can give rise to <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness.</b> The effect of movement is less clear, positive effects {{and the lack of}} effects have both been observed. There are also individual differences, including sex and age, which can affect sensitivity to <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness.</b> By excluding tight bends, complex environments, start and stop situations in the scenarios, the frequency of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> is reduced. In short exposures, there is less risk of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> occurring. Repeated exposures can result in the trial participants getting used to the simulator environment. Also, persons who do not consider themselves to be at all sensitive as regards motion sickness can be affected by <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness,</b> for which reason, previous experience of motion sickness is not a good predictor of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness.</b> Experience of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> in VTI's research simulator is summarised. The problems have been reduced, largely thanks to simulator design. Finally, relevant aspects are discussed as regards the planning of a study of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> in a VTI simulator...|$|E
40|$|The {{requirement}} {{to evaluate the}} differential impacts of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> on performance assessments was explored. <b>Simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> and performance data were analyzed in two phases that indicated: 1) an experimental display condition by age interaction with regard to development of simulator sickness; and 2) associated detrimental effects of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> on performance. Arguably, these results may be quite disturbing to users, and past users, of simulators for system and other Development, Test and Evaluation efforts (DT&Es). The utility of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> measures as covariates, {{in the analysis of}} performance effects, is demonstrated as a means for their assessment and statistical control.

40|$|In {{order to}} be an {{effective}} tool for driver evaluation and education, driving simulators need to be better de-signed to reduce <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness.</b> This study investigated driving in four environments (country, subur-ban, city, and curves) using a simulator.

A mini-SSQ was used to measure the accumulation of <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> over trials. From trial 1 to trial 5, reported <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> increased linearly. From trial 5 through 8, the rate of in-crease in <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> decreased.

30|$|A final {{consideration}} for strengthening users’ presence {{is to reduce}} distractions to the virtual experience, such as by using physical dividers and headphones. A common distraction is <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness,</b> presenting with symptoms similar to other kinds of motion sickness. Symptoms like nausea, oculomotor disturbances (such as eye strain), and disorientation [69] can occur when human sensory systems conflict, {{as in the case}} of illusory motion induced by virtual environments [70] or mismatches between stereoscopy and other depth cues [71]. <b>Simulator</b> <b>sickness</b> can be assessed using pre- and post-exposure completion of the <b>Simulator</b> <b>Sickness</b> Questionnaire (SSQ) [69], which measures the 27 symptoms associated with <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness.</b> To avoid extreme <b>simulator</b> <b>sickness,</b> exposure should be limited. Additionally, users’ tendency for motion sickness might be screened and those individuals with high tendency for motion sickness might be discouraged from taking part in virtual reality research.|$|E
