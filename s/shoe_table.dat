40|$|As {{reported}} to ORNL, concomitant {{with the introduction}} of different deicing and anti-icing compounds, there was an increase in the brake failure rate of tractor-trailer trucks. A forensic evaluation of a failed brake system was performed. Optical and scanning electron microscopic evaluation showed corrosion to be mostly confined to the brake table/lining interface. The corrosion is non-uniform as is to be expected for plain carbon steel in chloride environments. This initial analysis found no evidence for the chlorides of calcium and magnesium, which are the newly introduced deicing and antiicing compounds and are less soluble in water than the identified chlorides of sodium and potassium, in the scale. The result could be as a result of non-exposure of the examined brake table to calcium and magnesium chloride. The mechanisms for the increased failure rate are postulated as being an increased rate of corrosion due to positive shifts in the corrosion potential, and an increased amount of corrosion due to an increased ''time of wetness'' that results from the presence of hygroscopic salts. Laboratory scale evaluation of the corrosion of plain carbon steel in simulated deicing and anti-icing solutions need to be performed to determine corrosion rates and morphological development of corrosion product, to compare laboratory data to in-service data, and to rank economically feasible replacement materials for low carbon steel. In addition, the mechanical behavior of the lining attached to the brake <b>shoe</b> <b>table</b> needs to be assessed. It is opined that an appropriate adjustment of materials could easily allow for a doubling of a brake table/lining lifetime. Suggestions for additional work, to clarify the mechanisms of rust jacking and to develop possible solutions, are described...|$|E

40|$|Introduction and Objectives: The Oxford Foot Model (OFM) [1] was {{developed}} to get accurate measurement of foot movement during gait as the bone pin method [2] is not practical for most clinical situations. It has been validated in adults [3] and children [4]. However, since barefoot walking on a treadmill is not recommended {{there is a question}} over whether the OFM can be usefully applied in facilities such as the Motek CAREN (Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment - motekmedical. com). Consequently, there is an interest to see if applying OFM markers to shoes can give useful results when measuring human walking on treadmills. This study looks at the differences in measurements using the OFM between walking over-ground (barefoot and with shoes) and on a treadmill (with shoes). Methods: Nine boys (mean age 13. 5 ± 0. 5 yrs, height 1. 59 ± 0. 09 m, mass 47. 8 ± 8. 3 kg) were recruited. Retro-reflective markers were attached bilaterally following the Plug-in-Gait lower limb and OFM models. The over-ground (barefoot and with shoes) trials were recorded in a standard gait laboratory (12 camera Vicon T-Series). Barefoot trials were performed first to minimise the need to reattach markers. The treadmill walking trials were recorded in the CAREN immediately after the over-ground trials (12 camera Vicon Bonita 10). The treadmill speed was set to match the speed of over-ground walking in the gait laboratory. Gait events were determined from force plate contacts. All the boys wore light indoor training shoes. Data was captured using Vicon Nexus 1. 8. 5 and processed using Plug in Gait and OFM models in Nexus 2. 1. Results: There was no difference in ankle kinematics between over-ground (barefoot and with shoes) and on a treadmill (with shoes). Although Forefoot-Hindfoot angles were comparable to the literature in the barefoot condition, {{this was not the case}} with <b>shoes</b> (<b>Table</b> 1). Barefoot, there was a steady dorsiflexing motion throughout stance until push off which was signified by a rapid plantar-flexing motion. With shoes on, the same model segments show rapid dorsiflexion, then plantar flexion during early stance followed by neutral position held until push-off. Conclusion: Reinschmidt and colleagues [2] reported that the shape of the calcaneal motion curves was similar for shoe mounted markers and bone markers, but that the shoe-mounted markers overestimated joint angles. In this study, the shape of the curves was quite different...|$|R

60|$|Stamping up the stairs, and thumping her {{umbrella}} upon {{every step}} as she went, hot vengeance breathing from between her parted lips, {{and her eyes}} flashing with the delight of prospective fury, she entered her room. The light of the afternoon had but just begun to wane, and she had not made three steps into the apartment, before her eyes fell upon a pair of faded, light blue shoes, which stood side by side upon a table. She stopped suddenly, and stood, pale and rigid. Her grasp upon her umbrella loosened, and, unnoticed, it fell upon the floor. Then, her eyes still fixed upon the shoes, she moved slowly sidewise towards the closet. She tried the door, and found it still locked; then {{she put her hand}} in her pocket, drew out the key, looked at it, and dropped it. With faltering steps she drew near the table, and stood supporting herself by the back of a chair. Any one else would have seen upon that table merely a pair of baby's shoes; but she saw more. She saw the tops of the little socks which she had folded away for the last time so many years before; she saw the first short dress her child had ever worn; it was tied up with pink ribbons at the shoulders, from which hung two white, plump, little arms. There was a little neck, around which was a double string of coral fastened by a small gold clasp. Above this was a face, a baby face, with soft, pale eyes, and its head covered with curls of the lightest yellow, not arranged in artistic negligence, but smooth, even, and regular, as she so often had turned, twisted, and set them. It was indeed her baby girl who had come to her as clear and vivid in every feature, limb, and garment, as were the real <b>shoes</b> upon the <b>table.</b> For many minutes she stood, her eyes fixed upon the little apparition, then, slowly, she sank upon her knees by the chair, her sun-bonnet, which she had not removed, was bowed, so the pale eyes of the little one could not see her face, and from her own eyes came the first tears that that old woman had shed since her baby's clothes had been put away in the box.|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{physical}} burden for teachers in kindergartens {{in relation to the}} occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders among teachers. The main objective was to examine the physical demands of the profession of preschools educational staff. The work is divided into theoretical part and practical part. The research was conducted using qualitative method of semi-structured interviews with kindergartens teachers and LIFT / BEND score calculation. Fifteen teachers from three of kindergartens in the South Bohemian region participated in this research. Data from the interviews were evaluated by encoding method according to Švaříček and Šedivová (2007) and divided into schemes with a description. LIFT/BEND score was calculated according to Kovářová (2006) methodology. The calculation was based on the evaluation of the frequency of lifting, bending and handling of children. Reasearch questions were also answerd during the reasearch. The first research question contains "Is there a difference in the frequency of performing physically challenging activities in relation to the length of work experience in preschool facilities?" It was found that there is no difference between teachers in physical performance in relation to the length the practice. The analysis was performed using the LIFT / BEND score calcutation and testimonies of teachers in the interviews. The majority of teachers with the length of service over 20 years stated that avoids positions and activities that are unpleasant to them, such as kneeling, tying childrens <b>shoes,</b> bending over <b>tables</b> and more. Frequency of activities between younger and older teachers are not much different, but differ in subjective way of carrying out physically demanding tasks. The second research question is: "Is age a significant variable in the occurrence of musculoskeletal diseases?" From the primary perspective can be determined that age gains more musculoskeletal trouble, but according to the testimony of teachers and statistical evaluation, this relationship has not been confirmed. Age of teachers is not prerequisite for the development of musculoskeletal problems. According to nonparametric Spearman correlation this relationship is not statistically significant. From the findings of this research as well as international authors who have examined the relationship between physical load of lifting and bending while performing work in the so-called helping profession, age factor and length of service exhibits no significant importance, and vice versa occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders significantly affects the way of carrying out these activities in terms of their proper implementation. Therefore it should be ensured that teachers recieve education in health during preparations for their future careers...|$|R
40|$|The 11 th {{of march}} 2011, at 14. 16 the north east of Japan {{was hit by}} a 9. 0 -magni- tude earthquake, tsunami and by a nuclear {{accident}} at the power plant, Fukush- ima Daiichi due to the excessive water masses on land caused by the tsunami. The disaster left a large amount of land in a apocalyptic state – ruins, chaos, a population in grief and large areas flooded. Today, two years after the catastrophe, most of the debris have been cleaned up, leaving an empty landscape, and a society in a deep financial crises due to the cost of handling the debris, reconstruction of infrastructure and buildings and loss of efficiency for the industries. Most of the cities hit, was located in the rural parts of the japanese society, already experiencing a decrease in popula- tion and suffering from a declining fish industry. The society now have to face unemployment, an old generation, a sunken ground level (due to the earthquake the land have changed), reconstruction and a large amount of the population living in temporary housing. The areas that used to be residential areas now have become ‘danger zones’ meaning that they can not any longer be used for residential housing, but instead will be made mainly into park areas and some industry. The remaining population in these areas have their life written into these places and remaining foundations, some wish to rebuild where they used to live while others are afraid of new disasters so they choose a site on higher ground. Most of the affected habitants is waiting for the city government to make decisions, where they are going to live and which house, (if any), that will be built to them, since they are not in a financially situation where they can rebuilt themselves. The ruins are therefor loaded with different memories and stories, but often this is forgotten {{in order to create a}} ‘safe’ and functional future. This thesis ask the question if we should just move on, forgetting the past, and build new or if there is a way where we can be futuristic without forgetting the quali- ties from the past? This work will be focused on the city of Ishinomaki as case study of a topia in an apocalyptic state and on how fragments of a space can be reconstructed through the notion of memory. Walking around in the devastated areas among the ruins, in which nature have started to take over the concrete, one notice a red spray-painted number on the visible remains of the disaster. Spraycanned with a number, checked by scientist, marked after the number that people stood in line at the cityhall in order to turn their house in for demolition, in other cases the people do not longer exist and the city govern- ment have taken over the place. The ruins is visible remains of the past, both as in what life was before and what happened. They becomes a symbolic display of different layers of time. The remains contain a symbolic presence of a paused time, temporality and memory. In the ‘ruins’ of these houses lays the history and stories of the life that was. Fragments of beings. The non-beings showing the beings. Personal belongings and traces of the life that was, remains in the ruins. It offer glimpses of daily life and daily reality of the life that was before disaster. A cup, a bike, videotapes, books, clothes, <b>shoes,</b> a <b>table.</b> In the aftermath of the apocalypso the city have become a topia where the past is the event that happened and the future is seen in construction and volunteers walk- ing the streets and lands of the city. A city where the past is present in the visible remains of the event and a future that is awaiting. The presence becomes a paused time, a non time, on its way to something else. Ruins created by natural disasters is an unwanted topia, but it is also a forced physical spatiality that can become a new beginning and bring new uses for ar- chitecture. What happens when the physical frame is gone and the only thing left is a mental frame consisting of the memory of what was moreover, how can that be used to create new forms of architecture? This thesis is about a method, a journey into the aftermath of a catastrophe and a reflection about, how we as architects can change the conditions of a state through simple means...|$|R

On next day, that woman again calls her that all women are saying that they want lawn's all three-piece suit but she says she is not one of them. In accordance to Zubia, that her Khursheed aunt and Shaista Aapa is one of them. She tells to her mother-in-law that Annie's husband brings all things for her and she says that he is an engineer that's why and Zubia tells her that Faisal ought be engineer at first. She later asks from her the general questions and her mother-in-law knows all the answers. Faisal also asks her questions she knows and she tells all answers and he says her that they will not ask from her these easy questions and says her he has not problem with her quizz but he has problem with her attitude and says her that she has also other occupations to do. She later wears clothes and OMG!! her mother-in-law is unconscious. She brings her to hospital. Faisal says her {{to take care of her}} mother-in-law. Her neighbour calls her and says in accordance, Jameela aunt also won the three-piece suit. Zubia on next day polished his shoes and says Faisal to buy a new one but he refuses, saying that his mother needs care and this home, all money is spent here. Her neighbour Annie calls her to buy some important things to buy. She buys and gives her taking cash herself and said her that no cash given. She shies on her mistake and wants to return her. She writes letter to Annie saying that she done a mistake that she didn't give her a cash money she got from there but she returns her saying that she can take it. Faisal calls her saying that he got a new tuition who give her advance fee. She becomes happy and excited but he says that she shouldn't be happy. In night, he says her what she is thinking but she tells her that if there would be a baby, how would we afford money. He sleeps while she thinks to say him that she loves blue colored-suits but there are no enough blue suits. She on next day gets Rs. 320 from cash account from her neighbour. She gives him dinner and they talk about affording suit. She says him that from some days, she is working for Kifayat Sha'ari (Saving) to her neighbor. He says that this is a very good thing and she can buy one lawn three-piece suit per month. He finds <b>shoes</b> from dining <b>table.</b> She tells him that apart from the three-piece suit, they can buy other things as well.
