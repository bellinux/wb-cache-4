60|$|Striking {{instances}} {{of this first}} class of cases were given in the sixth chapter, namely, of the occasional reappearance, in variously-coloured breeds of the pigeon, of blue birds with all the marks characteristic of the wild Columba livia. Similar cases were given {{in the case of}} the fowl. With the common ass, as the legs of the wild progenitor are almost always striped, we may feel assured that the occasional appearance of such stripes in the domestic animal is a case of <b>simple</b> <b>reversion.</b> But I shall be compelled to refer again to these cases, and therefore here pass them over.|$|E
5000|$|The booming {{housing market}} halted {{abruptly}} {{in many parts}} of the United States in late summer of 2005, and as of summer 2006, several markets faced the issues of ballooning inventories, falling prices, and sharply reduced sales volumes. In August 2006, Barron's magazine warned, [...] "a housing crisis approaches", and noted that the median price of new homes dropped almost 3% since January 2006, that new-home inventories hit a record in April and remained near all-time highs, that existing-home inventories were 39% higher than they were just one year earlier, and that sales were down more than 10%, and predicted that [...] "the national median price of housing will probably fall by close to 30% in the next three years ... <b>simple</b> <b>reversion</b> to the mean." ...|$|E
5000|$|Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822) aligned most of {{his views}} on vegetarianism with those of Ritson. Like Ritson, Shelley {{believed}} that a meatless diet was the best mode of consumption for a healthy, disease-free life. He believed that human disease could be alleviated by a <b>simple</b> <b>reversion</b> back to a plant-based diet. The eating of meat, to Shelley, was a practice that polluted the body with syphilis, among other unpleasant ailments. In A Vindication of Natural Diet he wrote, [...] "Should ever a physician be born with the genius of Locke, I am persuaded that he might trace all bodily and mental derangements to our unnatural habits," [...] these unnatural habits being the consumption of meat. He compared {{the negative effects of}} a meat-based diet to alcoholism, asking, [...] "How many thousands have become murderers and robbers, bigots and domestic tyrants, dissolute and abandoned adventurers, from the use of fermented liquors?". He goes on to suggest that, a human of gentle disposition towards animals, [...] "rising from a meal of roots," [...] will be a healthy man whose only threat of death will be that of his own natural, old age.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} the payout ratio as a predictor of a firmâ€™s future earnings growth. Recent evidence rejects the hypothesis that firm which retain a large portion of their earnings have strong future earnings growth. Higher dividend payout ratios instead correspond to higher future earnings growth. Examining both listed and delisted firms on the Australian stock exchange over the period 1989 to 2008, we provide further evidence that the dividend payout ratio is positively linked to future earnings growth. The results hold over both one, three and five year periods. Furthermore, our results rejected claims that such a relationship was caused by <b>simple</b> mean <b>reversion</b> in earnings. We find no evidence to support the cash flow signaling and free cash flow hypotheses as an explanation for this relationship...|$|R
60|$|But Naudin's view, as propounded by him, is not {{applicable}} to the reappearance of characters lost long ago by variation; and it is hardly applicable to races or species which, after having been crossed at some former period with a distinct form, and having since lost all traces of the cross, nevertheless occasionally yield an individual which reverts (as {{in the case of}} the great- great-grandchild of the pointer Sappho) to the crossing form. The most <b>simple</b> case of <b>reversion,</b> namely, of a hybrid or mongrel to its grandparents, is connected by an almost perfect series with the extreme case of a purely-bred race recovering characters which had been lost during many ages; and we are thus led to infer that all the cases must be related by some common bond.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{a new technique}} of temporary ileal anastomotic stoma, following small bowel resection, in patients where the anastomosis is anticipated to have borderline margins with dubious viability. METHODS: Five patients underwent enterectomy and partially anastomosed end-loop ileostomy at the University Hospital of Larissa between 2000 and 2006. Enterectomy was performed because of conditions such as mesenteric vascular occlusive disease, radiation entritis and small bowel injury. RESULTS: Postoperatively, none of the patients developed any stoma-related or anastomotic complications. There were no major complications. All patients were discharged between the 8 th and 15 th day after the procedure, and the stoma was closed 3 wk to 4 wk later. CONCLUSION: We believe that our proposed modification of end-loop ileostomy is a simple, quick and safe technique with minimal stoma-related morbidity, and with <b>simple</b> and safe <b>reversion.</b> This technique {{can be considered as}} a useful option in the treatment of ischemic or radiation-induced enteritis, and in the management of severe intestinal trauma.

40|$|Chemical and histochemical analyses, {{including}} testicular and staphylococcal hyaluronidase digestion, {{have been}} made of a jaw myxoma and the results show the presence of two acid mucopolysaccharides. Of the total mucopolysaccharide present 80 % was hyaluronic acid and 20 % chondroitin sulphate. The high content of non-sulphated mucopolysaccharide would seem to explain the paucity of fibres characteristic of the myxoma. It is suggested that myxomas generally probably have a similar high hyaluronic acid content. It is considered that the cell concerned is a mesenchymal cell elaborating non-sulphated mucopolysaccharide and may be called a `myxoblast'; it is metabolically different from the sulphated-mucopolysaccharide-collagen-producing fibroblast. The high hyaluronic acid content {{is much greater than}} that found in embryonic connective tissue and may be a significant factor in the neoplastic behaviour of the myxomatous tissue. The aggressive behaviour of the myxoma is against a <b>simple</b> <b>reversion</b> to embryonic mesenchyme. It is concluded that the myxoblast is an active mucopolysaccharide-secreting cell and that mucin in the myxoma is not a sign of cell degeneration of preexisting fibroblasts or collagen...|$|E
40|$|The academical {{research}} on o shore shipping markets is very limited. This thesis {{is an attempt}} to improve our understanding of the spot rates for o shore shipping markets and consequently our ability to do more accurate pricing. I perform an empirical analysis of the most signi cant characteristics of the spot rates for Platform Supply Vessels (PSV) and Anchor Handling Tug Supply (AHTS) vessels and propose a model able to capture these dynamics. The proposed spot rate model is an extension to the <b>simple</b> geometric mean <b>reversion</b> model, incorporating two-regime mean reversion, jumps and a deterministic seasonal function. Parameters are estimated based on the historical spot rates and the model is calibrated for the North Sea market. Using modern derivatives techniques I derive the risk adjusted spot rate process and adopt Tvedt's [30] approach to pricing vessels as a spot rate contingent claim on cash ows, where the pay-o structure can be described as a continuous American call option. The proposed spot rate model is then applied to the problem and the partial di erential equation satisfying the value function of a vessel is derived. nhhma...|$|R
60|$|The great {{principle}} of inheritance {{to be discussed}} in this chapter has been recognised by agriculturists and authors of various nations, {{as shown by the}} scientific term ATAVISM, derived from atavus, an ancestor; by the English terms of REVERSION, or THROWING-BACK; by the French PAS-EN-ARRIERE; and by the German RUCKSCHLAG, or RUCKSCHRITT. When the child resembles either grandparent more closely than its immediate parents, our attention is not much arrested, though in truth the fact is highly remarkable; but when the child resembles some remote ancestor or some distant member in a collateral line,--and in the last case we must attribute this to the descent of all the members from a common progenitor,--we feel a just degree of astonishment. When one parent alone displays some newly-acquired and generally inheritable character, and the offspring do not inherit it, the cause may lie in the other parent having the power of prepotent transmission. But when both parents are similarly characterised, and the child does not, whatever the cause may be, inherit the character in question, but resembles its grandparents, {{we have one of the}} <b>simplest</b> cases of <b>reversion.</b> We continually see another and even more simple case of atavism, though not generally included under this head, namely, when the son more closely resembles his maternal than his paternal grand-sire in some male attribute, as in any peculiarity in the beard of man, the horns of the bull, the hackles or comb of the cock, or, as in certain diseases necessarily confined to the male sex; for as the mother cannot possess or exhibit such male attributes, the child must inherit them, through her blood, from his maternal grandsire.|$|R
