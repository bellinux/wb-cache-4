30|$|The {{dissolved}} salt fallouts {{analyzed by}} ion chromatography {{are rich in}} F, Cl, SO 4, Na, and Mg, with an exception of the white salt, which is almost pure NaCl (Table  1 and Fig.  2 c). Compositions of the dissolved <b>salt</b> <b>flakes,</b> shells and lumps {{are similar to those}} of the dried lake water samples, with large Mg/Na ratios (close to one), and variable but small Ca/Na ratios (smaller than one). The <b>salt</b> <b>flakes</b> emitted in 2011 have almost identical composition to the dried lake water samples. The salt shells and lumps emitted during the eruptive stage in 2015 have smaller SO 4 /Na and Ca/Na ratios and larger Cl/Na ratios than those of the <b>salt</b> <b>flakes.</b> The salt shells and lumps have similar composition. The compositions of the salt fallouts, as measured by the EDS analysis, are quite variable even when different spots on the same sample were analyzed. A 10  ×  10  μm area is analyzed using the EDS, and the large observed variation indicates a heterogeneous composition, likely due to the distribution of non-water-soluble particles such as fragments of mineral and rock fragments.|$|E
30|$|Compositions of the <b>salt</b> <b>flakes</b> {{collected}} in 2011 are {{almost identical to}} those of the dried crater lake water samples (Fig.  2). Compositions of the salt shells and lumps {{collected in}} March 2015 are similar to, but have larger Cl/SO 4 ratios than, the <b>salt</b> <b>flakes.</b> The salt shells and lumps have an identical composition which indicates that the salt lumps are recrystallized materials from the salt shells. The salt shells collected in January 2015 have an intermediate Cl/SO 4 ratio of the salts than those collected in 2011 and March 2015, suggesting a gradual increase in the Cl/SO 4 ratios with time. The salt shells are likely derived from the subsurface hydrothermal solutions. The temporal increase in Cl/SO 4 ratios can be caused by gradual changes in the hydrothermal solution composition under the subsurface conditions. However, no evidence of the composition of subsurface hydrothermal solutions currently exists, and the cause for compositional variation of the salt fallouts remains unclear.|$|E

50|$|<b>Flake</b> <b>salts</b> are a {{category}} of salt characterized by their dry, plate-like ("lamellose") crystals. Their structure {{is a result of}} differing growth rates between the faces and edges of the crystal, an effect that can be achieved in various ways. <b>Flake</b> <b>salts</b> may occur naturally but can also be produced by a variety of methods, including boiling brine over metal salt pans or evaporating it in greenhouse solar evaporators. The technologies used as well as atmospheric conditions can yield varying crystal structures. <b>Flake</b> <b>salts</b> can form as irregular shavings, pyramidal shapes, boxes, or potato chip-like laminated crystals. These salts tend to have lower trace mineral content than other salts, giving them a stronger salty taste. Most form as thin, flattened out crystals with a large surface area and low mass that give them a crunchy texture and relatively fast dissolution rate. Because of the salts' delicate structures, selmeliers tend to use them as finishing salts.|$|R
40|$|By {{letting a}} NaCl aqueous {{solution}} of low (0. 01 M) concentration evaporate on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface, {{it is possible}} to form a thin film of salt. However, pre-existing surface nanobubbles prevent the homogeneous coverage of the surface with the salt, keeping the footprint areas on the substrate pristine. Comparing the surface nanobubbles in the salt solution with their associated footprint after drying, provides information on the shrinkage of nanobubbles during the hours-long process of drying the liquid film. At a slightly higher NaCl concentration and thus salt layer thickness, the nanobubbles are covered with a thin blanket of salt. Once the liquid film has evaporated until a water film remains that is smaller than the height of the nanobubbles, the blanket of salt cracks and unfolds into a flower-like pattern of <b>salt</b> <b>flakes</b> that is located at the rim of the nanobubble footprint. The formation of a blanket of salt covering the nanobubbles is likely to considerably or even completely block the gas out-flux from the nanobubble, partially stabilizing the nanobubbles against dissolution...|$|E
30|$|All {{the salt}} materials, {{including}} the <b>salt</b> <b>flakes,</b> the salt shells, the salt lumps, {{and the white}} salts, were analyzed. In order to evaluate {{the origin of the}} salt materials, the composition of the crater lake waters and leachate of the ashes emitted by the ash eruptions was also analyzed. The water-soluble components were analyzed using ion chromatography, and the bulk composition was measured through energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). For the analyses of the water-soluble components, the salt materials were dissolved in pure water and filtered through a 0.45 -µm membrane filter, diluted, and analyzed without any further pre-treatment. Some solid materials, such as mineral and rock fragments, and elemental sulfur, remained settled after dissolution in the pure water. The concentrations of F, Cl, SO 4, Na, K, Mg, and Ca were determined. Fluoride forms complex chemical compounds under conditions of high Fe and Al content; therefore, the results of the F analyses of the crater lake waters by the ion chromatography are not accurate (Takano et al. 2000). An EDS (Oxford X-Max 20) on a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM 6610 LV) was used for the chemical composition analysis {{on the surface of the}} salt grains. Fragments of the salt samples were attached to an aluminum plate with double-side carbon tape and were then coated by graphite. Because the salt sample cannot be polished, only flat and smooth surfaces that could be oriented perpendicular to the microprobe were selected for analysis. The acceleration voltage of the electron microprobe was 15  kV, and the probe current was ~  1  nA. The X-ray signal lower than 10  keV was analyzed.|$|E
30|$|Various salt fallouts were {{observed}} during the intensive gas emission and ash eruption {{stages of the}} Nakadake crater of the Aso volcano. Chemical compositions of the salt fallouts were analyzed and compared {{to those of the}} ash leachates, the crater lake waters, and the dried samples of the crater lake water. Most of the salt fallouts have composition {{similar to those of the}} dried crater lake water samples and are quite different from those of the ash leachates. Flakes of salts {{were observed}} in May 2011 when only a small volume of the acid crater lake water remained, and a brownish plume intensively emitted from a high-temperature vent. The chemical composition indicates that the <b>salt</b> <b>flakes</b> are likely formed by the evaporation of the crater lake water sprayed by the fumarolic jet. Hollow spherical salt shells were observed at several times during the eruptive stage of 2014 – 2015, when the ash eruption with intermittent Strombolian explosions continued with temporal pauses. The salts are released from the plume during weak ash eruptions or shortly after the temporal cessation of the ash eruptions. Although the crater lake completely dried up prior to the eruptive stage, the similarity in chemical composition suggests that the shell salts are also formed by the evaporation of an underground hydrothermal solution pouring into the conduit of a volcanic plume. The hollow structure suggests that the salts were formed by the heating of hydrothermal solution droplets suspended in the plume stream. The preservation of the fragile hollow shell structure, even after transport by the plume, suggests that the hydrothermal solution pours into the conduit at a shallow depth well above the level of magma fragmentation. The salt shells indicate a close distribution of the hydrothermal system surrounding the erupting vent, even during the continuous magmatic eruption stage. The perturbation of the magmatic–hydrothermal interface can cause phreatomagmatic explosions, which, at this volcano, often occur at the end of an eruptive period.|$|E

Comparou-se a influência das modificações nas formulações e processos de fabricação de uma carne suína reestrurada, pré-cozida e congelada, através de análises físicas, químicas, sensoriais e de custos de matérias primas. Em linhas gerais, o processamento desenvolvido nessa pesquisa envolve a mistura de carne cortada em cubos a 1 °C, com adição de sal, tripolifosfato e gelo em escamas, até que ocorra uma intensa liberação de proteínas miofibrilares. Adiciona-se, então a carne moída, a 1 °C, e os demais ingredientes, misturando até que a massa atinja 5 °C, quando é adicionada a gordura e mais gelo. Mistura-se por mais 4 min., sem vácuo, e mais 1, 5 min. sob vácuo. O embutimento da massa é feito em envoltório de poliamida e o cozimento com elevação gradual da temperatura da água até o produto atingir 72 °C. O produto é, então, resfriado, fatiado, embalado à vácuo e armazenado a - 18 °C. As fatias são aquecidas em chapa elétrica a temperatura de 180 °C até atingirem a temperatura interna de 75 °C, antes das análises sensoriais, de cor e textura objetivas. Avaliou-se sensorialmente os tratamentos do experimento 1 através de teste triangular, onde verificou-se diferença (p 0, 05) nas medidas de LH (luminosidade), aH (teor de vermelho) e bH (teor de amarelo) entre os tratamentos A e B. Os valores TBA encontrados foram de 0, 5 e 0, 6 mg malonaldeídolkg de amostra para os tratamentos B e A respectivamente, não observando-se diferença significativa. A avaliação sensorial não revelou diferença significativa quanto a preferência em relação a suculência entre os tratamentos, que receberam pontuação média de 4, 68 (TratA) e 5, 74 (TratB), próximas do valor 5, considerado ideal. Também não houve diferença estatística para sabor e aceitação global, porém, o TratB obteve valores de avaliação um pouco superiores ao TratA. No experimento 2, estudou-se a substituição parcial e total da carne de pernil por carne de paleta, para reduzir os custos da formulação. Comparou-se três formulações contendo carragena, STP e água, denominadas tratamentos 1, 2 e 3. O Tratl contendo 100 % de carne de pernil suíno; o Trat 2 com 50 % carne de pernil e 50 % carne de paleta, e o Trat 3 com 100 % carne de paleta. Não houve diferenças (p> 0, 05) entre os tratamentos nas medldas de cor, exceto para a medida aH (p 0, 05) entre os tratamentos. Também não houve diferença (p. 0, 05) na aceitação das amostras, porém, o Trat 2 apresentou escores um pouco superiores aos demais. No experimento 3, estudou-se a influência do congelamento rápido criogênico, com gás de nitrogênio líquido (TratR), em comparação com o congelamento convencional (Trat C) em carne suína reestruturada, durante a estocagem em freezer a - 18 °C. Calculou-se as formulações dos dois tratamentos para serem isoprotéicas e com baixo teor de gordura, utilizando-se a mistura comercial de carragena e tripolifosfato. Não se detectou diferença (p> 0, 05) entre os tratamentos nas medidas de cor feitas nas porções pré-cozidas frias. Porém, após o aquecimento, observou-se diferenças (p 0, 05) entre os tratamentos, porém o Trat R apresentou valores menores tanto para o pico 1 como para a força máxima. Os valores TBA apresentaram aumento linear relativamente intenso nas três primeiras semanas e um aumento relativamente mais lento nas semanas seguintes. Os valores de TBA para o Trat R foram inferiores aos do Trat C. Não se detectou qualquer tendência de aumento ou redução de valores sensoriais quanto ao sabor que pudessem ser relacionados aos valores TBA. Three {{experiments were}} carried out with the following objectives: (1) to {{study the effects of}} partial replacement of fat by water using 0, 6 % of a commercial mixture (Bekaplus C 4 @) of carrageenan and sodium trypoliphosfate (stp) in equal parts; (2) to evaluate the possibility of partial and total replacement of boneless fresh pork ham by blade plus shoulder meat, and (3) to quantify the influence of two freezing methods - cryogenic versus conventional - on the restructured meat portions. The effects of these changes in fonnulation and processing of the restructured, precooked and frozen pork were compared through physical, chemical, sensorial and raw material cost analysis. In general tenns, the processing methods, developed in this research, involve the mixture of chunked meat (at 1 °C) with addition of <b>salt,</b> stp and <b>flaked</b> ice, until the release of a fair amount of myofibrilar proteins. Ground meat trimmings (at 1 °C) and the other ingredients were then added while mixing until the temperature of the meat reaches 5 C, when more flaked ice and fat trimmings are added. The meat batch is then mixed for another 4 min. with the blender (or tumbler) lid opened, and 1, 5 min. under vacuum. Stuffing is made in poliamide casings and the cooking process is done by gradual rise of the water temperature until the internal product reaches 72 °C. The product is then chilled, sliced, vacuum packed and kept at - 18 °C. The experiment 1 treatments were evaluated through a sensory analysis triangle test and later through a preference test for flavor, tenderness, juiciness and global acceptance. In the experiment 2, it was applied a difference test with a structured hedonic scale. In the experiment 3, a scale was used to measure the intensity of characteristic, strange, and rancid fat (WOF) taste throughout the frozen storage period. Objective color measurements of LH, aH and bH were made with a Minolta CR 300 colorimeter, and objective texture measurements of peak 1 and maximum force were determined with a TA. XT 2 / 25 texture system coupled with a burger punch device. In the experiment 1, two formulations with the same protein level, labeled treatments A and B, were compared. Treatment A was calculated to have 16 % fat and 65 % moisture, and Treat. B, with carrageenan and stp to have 8 % fat and 73 % moisture. There was a difference (p 0, 05) between treatments A and B, for LH (luminance), aH (redness), and bH (yellowness) values. The TBA number for treatments A and B were 0, 5 and 0, 6 mg malonaldehydelkg of sample, and no signifícant difference was found. No difference (p> 0, 05) was found for juiciness between A and B treatments, with scores of 4, 68 (A) and 5, 74 (B), close to 5, which was previously established as the most desirable score for this trait. Also, no signifícant differences were found for flavor and general acceptance, but Treat. B had slightly higher scores than Treat A. In the experiment 2, the partial and total replacement of ham by blade plus shoulder were intended to reduce formulation costs. Three formulations containing carrageenan, stp and water, were labeled treatments 1, 2 and 3. Treatment 1 had 100 % ofthe meat from ham; Treat. 2 had 50 % ofthe meat from ham and 50 % from blade plus shoulder, and Treat 3 had 100 % ofthe meat from blade plus shoulder. There were no differences (p> 0, 05) between treatments for color measurements of the non-heated samples, except for aH value (p< 0, 05). However, differences (p< 0, 05) were found for the LH and bH values measured on the heated samples. The objective analyses of texture have not shown any difference among treatments. Also, there was no detectable sensorial differences, but Treat 2 had slightly higher scores than the other two. In the experiment 3, the influence offast cryogenic freezing with liquid nitrogen gas (Treat. R) compared to the conventional freezing (Treat. C) on the restructured pork during frozen storage at - 18 °C was studied. The formulations for both treatments were calculated to have equal composition, with a low fat content and 0, 6 % of the commercial rnixture of carrageenan and stp. No differences (P. 0, 05) were found between treatments for the color measurements made on the non-heated samples, but differences (p 0, 05) between treatments in the objective texture analysis, but Treat.
