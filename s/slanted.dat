40|$|<b>Slant</b> {{correction}} is {{an indispensable}} technique for handwritten word recognition systems. Conventional <b>slant</b> correction techniques estimate the average <b>slant</b> angle of component characters and then correct the <b>slant</b> uniformly. Thus these conventional techniques will perform successfully {{under the assumption}} that each word is written with a constant <b>slant.</b> However, it is more widely acceptable assumption that the <b>slant</b> angle fluctuates during writing a word. In this paper, a nonuniform <b>slant</b> correction technique is presented where the <b>slant</b> correction problem is formulated as an optimal estimaiton problem of local <b>slant</b> angles at all horizontal positions. The optimal estimation is governed by a criterion function and several constraints for the global and local validity of the local angles. The optimal local <b>slant</b> angles which maximize the criterion satisfying the constraints are searched for efficiently by a dynamic programming based algrithm. Experimental results show the advantageous characteristics of the present technique over the uniform <b>slant</b> correction techniques. 1...|$|R
40|$|Handwritten words {{often have}} <b>slant</b> which {{need to be}} {{estimated}} and corrected before character segmentation and recognition. Several methods have been proposed for average <b>slant</b> estimation and correction. However, average <b>slant</b> estimation has the problem such that local <b>slant</b> will be overestimated or underestimated when the <b>slant</b> in a word varies from character to character. To solve the problem, this paper proposes three methods for local <b>slant</b> estimation, which are simple iterative method, high speed iterative method and 8 -directional chain code method.

40|$|AbstractAlthough it {{is known}} that {{high-level}} spatial attention affects adaptation for a variety of stimulus features (including binocular disparity), the influence of voluntary attentional control—and the associated awareness—on adaptation has remained unexplored. We developed an ambiguous surface <b>slant</b> adaptation stimulus with conflicting monocular and binocular <b>slant</b> signals that instigated two mutually exclusive surface percepts with opposite <b>slants.</b> Using intermittent stimulus removal, subjects were able to voluntarily select one of the two rivaling <b>slant</b> percepts for extended adaptation periods, enabling us to dissociate <b>slant</b> adaptation due to awareness from stimulus-induced <b>slant</b> adaptation. We found that <b>slant</b> aftereffects (SAE) for monocular and binocular test patterns had opposite signs when measured simultaneously. There was no significant influence of voluntarily controlled perceptual state during adaptation on SAEs of monocular or binocular signals. In addition, the magnitude of the binocular SAE did not correlate with the magnitude of perceived <b>slant.</b> Using adaptation to one <b>slant</b> cue, and testing with the other cue, we demonstrated that multiple <b>slant</b> signals adapt independently. We conclude that <b>slant</b> adaptation occurs before the level of <b>slant</b> awareness. Our findings place the site of stereoscopic <b>slant</b> adaptation after disparity and eye posture are interpreted for <b>slant</b> [as demonstrated by Berends et al. (Berends, E.

40|$|Abstract:- A vector {{rule-based}} {{approach and}} analysis to on-line <b>slant</b> signature recognition algorithm is presented. Extracting features in signature is an intense area due to complex human behavior, which is developed through repetition. Features such as direction, <b>slant,</b> baseline, pressure, speed {{and numbers of}} pen ups and downs {{are some of the}} dynamic information signature that can be extracted from an online method. This paper presents the variables involve in designing the algorithm for extracting the <b>slant</b> feature. Signature Extraction Features System (SEFS) is used to extract the <b>slant</b> features in signature automatically for analysis purposes. The system uses both local and global <b>slant</b> characteristics in extracting the feature. Local <b>slant</b> is the longest <b>slant</b> among the detected <b>slant</b> while the global <b>slant</b> represents the highest quantity of classified <b>slant</b> whether the <b>slant</b> are leftward, upright or rightward.

5|$|A new Prisons Act {{was passed}} in 1981, which updated the 1903 act and its eleven {{amendments}} with modern philosophies and practices – codifying departmental orders, instructions, and policy documents. The act was, however, <b>slanted</b> towards prisoner management and safety, as the government and opposition were mindful of public opinion, {{and the perception of}} lax security at Fremantle. The result was legislation criticised by the Criminal Lawyers Association, academics, and newspapers, including for minimal welfare provisions that did little to ensure prisoner welfare.

40|$|We {{examined}} whether binocular saccadic eye {{movements are}} determined solely by disparity-defined <b>slant</b> {{or whether they}} are influenced by both disparity-defined and perceived <b>slant.</b> The Werner illusion was used to distinguish a plane's disparity-defined <b>slant</b> from its perceived <b>slant.</b> Three subjects viewed a horizontally elongated test strip that was flanked vertically by two planes. The perceived <b>slant</b> of the test strip depended on the <b>slant</b> of the flanking planes. Subjects estimated the perceived <b>slant</b> of the test strip by adjusting the angle between two lines in a symbolic top view. The saccadic eye movements between targets on the test strip were recorded both with visual feedback (“later saccades”) and without visual feedback (“first saccades”). We calculated vergence differences for saccades between targets on the test strip (and for fixation on these targets). For each geometrical test strip <b>slant</b> we examined whether the vergence differences could be explained as an effect of perceived <b>slant.</b> This study shows that saccadic eye movements are determined predominantly by the disparity-defined <b>slant,</b> {{but they can be}} affected by perceived <b>slant,</b> particularly when multiple saccades are being made...|$|R

40|$|Multiple cues are {{typically}} available for perceiving the 3 D <b>slant</b> of surfaces, and <b>slant</b> perception {{has been used}} as a test case for investigating cue integration. Previous evidence suggests that texture and stereo <b>slant</b> cues contribute in an optimal Bayesian manner. We tested whether a Bayesian model could also account for perceptual underestimation of <b>slant</b> from texture. One explanation proposed by Todd, Christensen, and Guckes (2010) is that <b>slant</b> from texture is based on an inaccurate optical variable. An alternative Bayesian explanation is that perceptual underestimation is due to the influence of frontal cues and/or a frontal prior, which is weighted according to the reliability of <b>slant</b> cues. We measured <b>slant</b> perception using a hand-alignment task for conditions that provided only texture, only stereo, or combined texture and stereo cues. <b>Slant</b> estimates from monocular texture showed large biases toward frontal, with proportionally more underestimation at low <b>slants</b> than high <b>slants.</b> <b>Slant</b> estimates from stereo alone were more accurate, and adding texture information did not reduce accuracy. These results are consistent with a frontal influence that is decreasingly weighted as <b>slant</b> information becomes more reliable. We also included conditions with small cue conflicts to measure the relative weighting of texture and stereo cues. Consistent with previous studies, texture had a significant effect on <b>slant</b> estimates in binocular conditions, and the relative weighting of texture increased with <b>slant.</b> In some cases, perceived <b>slant</b> from combined stereo and texture cues was higher than from either cue in isolation. Both the perceptual biases and the cue weights were generally consistent with a Bayesian model that optimally integrates texture and stereo <b>slant</b> cues with frontal cues and/or a frontal prior. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|Due to the fog, {{visibility}} {{was low and}} the {{two main}} forces failed to notice Oxford's victory over Hastings. As such, {{the collapse of the}} Yorkist left wing had little (if any) effect on morale of either side. The fighting between Montagu's and Edward's groups was evenly matched and intense. The Lancastrian left wing, however, was suffering treatment similar to that Oxford had inflicted on its counterpart; Gloucester exploited the misaligned forces and beat Exeter back. Progress for Edward's brother was slow because his group was fighting up a slight slope. Nonetheless, the pressure he exerted on the Lancastrian left wing rotated the entire battle line. Warwick, seeing the shift, ordered most of his reserves to help ease the pressure on Exeter, and took the rest into fighting at the centre. Gradually, the battle line settled to an orientation that <b>slanted</b> north-east to south-west.|$|E

5|$|Garamond {{designed}} type for the Greek alphabet {{from the}} beginning of his attested career, but his most celebrated work in Greek, the Grecs du roi fonts, commissioned for the French government in 1540, are very different to his Latin designs: they attempt to simulate the elegant handwriting of Cretan scribe Angelo Vergecio and include a vast variety of alternate letters and ligatures to achieve this. This style is impractical for modern setting of body text, since it requires careful manual choice of characters for every word. Several 'Garamond' releases such as Adobe's contain Greek designs that are either a compromise between Garamond's upright Latin designs and his <b>slanted</b> Greek ones or primarily inspired by his Latin designs. The grecs du roi type, the contract for which survives, is the type with which Garamond enters the historical record, although it is clearly not the work of a beginner.

5|$|Heavy {{moldboard}} iron plow: Although use of {{the simple}} wooden ard in China must have preceded it, the earliest discovered Chinese iron plows date to roughly 500 BC, during the Zhou Dynasty (1122–256 BC) and were flat, V-shaped, and mounted on wooden poles and handles.

The moldboard allowed the Chinese to turn farm soil without clogging the plowshare with dirt, which was flung off the wheelbarrow via <b>slanted</b> wings on both sides. While the frame of excavated plowshares dating to the Warring States period (403–221 BC) were made mostly of perishable wood except for the iron blade, the frame of excavated plowshares dating to the Han Dynasty were made entirely of solid iron with the moldboard attached to the top to turn the soil.|$|E
