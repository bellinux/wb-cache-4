Four specimens were tested to investigate the effect of high strength concrete on the load carrying capacity of the concrete-filled <b>steel</b> square-tube <b>stub</b> columns. The effect of the presence of steel fiber in high strength concrete which filled in the steel tube was also investigated. The main parameters in the tests were: (1) the strength of concrete (30 Mpa and 100 Mpa), and (2) the use of reinforcing steel fiber in concrete (plain high strength concrete and steel fiber high strength concrete). The main purpose of these tests were three-step: (1) to describe a series of tests on composite stub columns, (2) to analyze the influence of several parameters, and (3) to compare the accuracy of the predictions by using the specifications in the code (ACI and EC 4 etc.) for the design of high-strength composite columns.

Assuming that concrete filled <b>steel</b> <b>stub</b> frame-shear wall is continuous elastic structure with infinite degree of freedom, free vibration equation is built. Furthermore, the effects of semi-rigid connection on natural periods and frequencies are studied. The formula to calculate the coefficient of natural periods is deduced.

The results show that semi-rigid connections tend to increase the natural period. However, the effect on higher modes is negligible. The seismic design suggestions of the semi-rigid concrete filled <b>steel</b> <b>stub</b> frame-shear wall are proposed. The proposed methods may supply references for the engineers. ...|$|E

A {{series of tests}} was conducted to study the behavior of short composite columns under axial compressive load; the cross section dimensions were 100 × 70 × 2 [*]mm.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the behaviour of cold-formed stainless steel tubular structural members, {{with an emphasis}} on ferritic stainless steels. Owing to the high comparative expense of stainless steel relative to traditional carbon steel, this study aims to identify and develop means of utilising the material more efficiently. A comprehensive material test programme was carried out as part of an extensive study into the prediction of strength enhancements in cold-formed structural sections that arise during production. Material tests on a total of 51 flat coupons and 28 corner coupons, extracted from a total of 18 cross-sections formed {{from a wide range of}} materials, were performed. A new, simple and universal predictive model for harnessing the cold-formed induced strength enhancements was developed which offers, on average, 19 % and 36 % strength enhancements for the cross-section flat faces and corner regions, respectively, relative to the strength of the unformed material. Ferritic stainless steels, having no or very low nickel content, offer a more viable alternative for structural applications to the more commonly used austenitic stainless steels, reducing both the level and variability of the initial material cost. There is currently limited information available on the structural performance of this type of stainless steel. Therefore, to overcome this limitation, a series of material, cross-section and member tests have been performed on two ferritic grades - EN 1. 4003 and EN 1. 4509. The experimental results were used to assess the applicability of the current codified design provisions to ferritic stainless steel structural components. Moreover, the elevated temperature performance of ferritic stainless steels, covering the material response and the flexural buckling behaviour, was investigated through analysis of experimental and numerical results, leading to proposals for suitable design recommendations. Finally, simplifications and refinements to the recently developed continuous strength method (CSM) were made. Comparison of the predicted capacities with over 140 collected test results on stainless <b>steel</b> <b>stub</b> columns and cross-sections in bending shows that the CSM offers improved accuracy and reduced scatter relative to the current design methods. The reliability of the approach has been demonstrated by statistical analyses, enabling its use in structural design standards. Open Acces...|$|E

Most of the research carried out to date involving concrete-filled steel sections has focussed on circular and rectangular tubes, with each shape exhibiting distinct behaviour. The degree of concrete confinement provided by the hollow section wall has been studied under pure compression but remains ambiguous for combined compressive and bending loads, with no current design provision for this loading combination. To explore the structural behaviour, laboratory tests were carried out using eight stub columns of two different tube wall thicknesses and applying axial compression under various eccentricities. Moment-rotation relationships were produced for each specimen to establish the influence of cross-section dimension and axis of bending on overall response. Full 3 D finite element models were developed, comparing the effect of different material constitutive models, until good agreement was found.

40|$|AbstractA stub-girder {{floor system}} is a {{composite}} system constructed from a continuous steel beam and a reinforced concrete slab separated {{by a series of}} short, typically wide, flange sections called stubs. The finite element method has been used in the analysis of this composite system where it is capable to represent the constituent parts, adopt adequate elements and use appropriate solution techniques. As the behavior of stub-girders presents significant nonlinear effects, it is fundamental that the interaction of all different components should be properly modeled as well as the interface behavior. The present work focuses on the modeling of stub-girders with full and partial shear connection in two and three dimensions. The proposed model contains all the main structural parameters and their associated nonlinearities (concrete slab, <b>steel</b> beam, <b>stubs,</b> and shear connectors). In this model, the shear connectors are modeled as springs to consider the geometry of studs in addition to the nonlinearity due to the interaction between the shear connector and the concrete slab. Tests and numerical results available in the literature are used to validate the models.
