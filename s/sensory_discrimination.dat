40|$|SummaryEarly psychologists, {{including}} Galton, Cattell, and Spearman, {{proposed that}} intelligence and simple <b>sensory</b> <b>discriminations</b> are constrained by common neural processes, predicting a close link between them [1, 2]. However, strong supporting {{evidence for this}} hypothesis remains elusive. Although people with higher intelligence quotients (IQs) are quicker at processing sensory stimuli [1 – 5], these broadly replicated findings explain a relatively modest proportion of variance in IQ. Processing speed alone is, arguably, a poor match for the information processing demands on the neural system. Our brains operate on overwhelming amounts of information [6, 7], and thus their efficiency is fundamentally constrained by an ability to suppress irrelevant information [8 – 21]. Here, we show that individual variability in a simple visual discrimination task that reflects both processing speed and perceptual suppression [22] strongly correlates with IQ. High-IQ individuals, although quick at perceiving small moving objects, exhibit disproportionately large impairments in perceiving motion as stimulus size increases. These findings link intelligence with low-level sensory suppression of large moving patterns—background-like stimuli that are ecologically less relevant [22 – 25]. We conjecture {{that the ability to}} suppress irrelevant and rapidly process relevant information fundamentally constrains both <b>sensory</b> <b>discriminations</b> and intelligence, providing an information-processing basis for the observed link...|$|R

50|$|Research {{on basic}} <b>sensory</b> <b>discriminations</b> often show that perceptual {{learning}} effects {{are specific to}} the trained task or stimulus. Many researchers take this to suggest that perceptual learning may work by modifying the receptive fields of the cells (e.g., V1 and V2 cells) that initially encode the stimulus. For example, individual cells could adapt to become more sensitive to important features, effectively recruiting more cells for a particular purpose, making some cells more specifically tuned for the task at hand. Evidence for receptive field change has been found using single-cell recording techniques in primates in both tactile and auditory domains.|$|R

50|$|Since the mid-1980s, {{there has}} been a new wave of {{interest}} in perceptual learning due to findings of cortical plasticity at the lowest sensory levels of sensory systems. Our increased understanding of the physiology and anatomy of our cortical systems has been used to connect the behavioral improvement to the underlying cortical areas. This trend began with earlier findings of Hubel and Wiesel that perceptual representations at sensory areas of the cortex are substantially modified during a short ("critical") period immediately following birth. Merzenich, Kaas and colleagues showed that though neuroplasticity is diminished, it is not eliminated when the critical period ends. Thus, when the external pattern of stimulation is substantially modified, neuronal representations in lower-level (e.g. primary) sensory areas are also modified. Research in this period centered on basic <b>sensory</b> <b>discriminations,</b> where remarkable improvements were found on almost any <b>sensory</b> task through <b>discrimination</b> practice. Following training, subjects were tested with novel conditions and learning transfer was assessed. This work departed from earlier work on perceptual learning, which spanned different tasks and levels.|$|R
40|$|Perceptual learning, the {{improvement}} in <b>sensory</b> <b>discriminations</b> with practise, is also subject to stimulus-specific interference from temporal jitter in a learning session or manipulations applied between or immediately after sessions. We demonstrate a novel form of perceptual interference where even a brief cueing exposure to a complex speech-in-noise task produces a forward interference on subsequent speech-in-noise learning. This potent interference generalizes across cueing context but specifically affects only late learning in the subsequent task, is resistant to the remediating effects of sleep and persists across an overnight delay involving sleep, and can be evoked by a single exposure 1 day before the learning. Learning in the speech-in-noise task is due to generalized improvements in discriminating and extracting signals (speech) from noise and we hypothesize that the forward interference represents interference with improvements in access to higher-level representations in rapid perception of ecologically-familiar complex signals such as speech from background noise...|$|R

5000|$|The {{heaviest}} criticism {{came from}} George Windholz (1931-2002) in 1993. He stated that Kalischer was evidently {{influenced by the}} research of the Pavlovians on the conditioned reflex method. He cited Maiorov who maintained that Kalischer and Georg Friedrich Nicolai were coworkers. He summarized his article as follows: [...] "When Kalischer initially described the Dressur method ... he, by failing to refer to the work of Graber, Lubbock, Thorndike, and Himstedt, assigned to himself the priority for the discovery of the discrimination method. ... He should have acknowledged that the <b>sensory</b> <b>discrimination</b> method had been used by fellow German scientists Graber and Himstedt. ... Apparently Kalischer convinced himself of having discovered a new <b>sensory</b> <b>discrimination</b> method, the Dressur. ... Kalischer might have been so impressed by his presumed discovery that he became insensitive to the need to acknowledge the work of other researchers who contributed to the discovery of discrimination. Kalischer must have blinded himself by his desire for priority in the discovery of this method. However, even given the murky situation with respect to discrimination, it becomes obvious that priority does not go to Kalischer. Rather, in our view, priority should be awarded to Graber, who outlined the <b>sensory</b> <b>discrimination</b> experimental design, and to Thorndike, who followed this design".Firkin and Whitworth in Dictionary of medical eponyms incorrectly attribute one of the first descriptions of Sturge-Weber disease to Otto Kalischer; however, it was Siegfried Kalischer, Otto's cousin, who described the pathology of this disease in 1899.|$|E
40|$|The {{olfactory}} epithelium {{of mammals}} is simple in appearance when fixed and stained with conventional techniques and viewed {{with the light}} microscope. In it, there are three types of cells, the olfactory receptors, the supporting, and the basal cells, all of which rest upon a thin basement membrane, demonstrable only with difficulty (1 - 5). In spite of its apparently simple organization and single type of receptor element, the olfactory epithelium is capable of remarkably fine <b>sensory</b> <b>discriminations.</b> Olfactory receptors respond to stimulating substances in extraordinarily small concentration. Moreover, the receptors are sensitive to an enormous range of odoriferous substances. Electrophysiological investigations (6 - 9) have led several investigators to suggest recently that discrimination depends upon the existence {{of different types of}} olfactory receptors with selective sensitivities to basic odors, and although the spatial distribution of receptors may account for coarse discriminations of odors, fine differentiation seems to depend upon specific sensitivity of individual receptors to particular molecular configurations (9) ...|$|R
40|$|The octopus is an {{exceptionally}} strong, active and manipulative animal.

40|$|<b>Sensory</b> <b>discriminations</b> often improve with {{practice}} (perceptual learning). Recent {{results show that}} practice does not necessarily lead to the best possible performance on the task. It was shown that learning a task (contrast discrimination) that has already reached saturation could be enabled by a contextual change in the stimulus (the addition of surrounding flankers) during practice. Psychophysical results with varying context show a behavior that is described by a network of local visual processors with horizontal recurrent interactions. We describe a mathematical learning rule for a modification of cortical synapses that is inspired by the experimental results {{and apply it to}} recurrent cortical networks that respond to external stimuli. The model predicts that repeated presentation of the same stimulus leads to saturation of synaptic modification, such that the strengths of recurrent connections depend on the configuration of the stimulus but not on its amplitude. When a new stimulus is introduced, the modification is rekindled until a new equilibrium is reached. This effect may explain the saturation of perceptual learning when practicing a certain task repeatedly. We present simulations of contrast discrimination in a simplified model of a cortical column in the primary visual cortex and show that performance o...|$|R
50|$|WDR neurons {{are found}} in the posterior grey column of the spinal cord, with their cell bodies located in the posterior horn (dorsal horn). This area of the spinal cord houses two {{different}} types of neurons responsible for detection of pain: WDR neurons and Nociceptive Specific (NS) neurons. As the name implies, NS neurons give specific short range responses. WDR neurons are able to give long range responses for a large variety of stimuli giving them the ability to help identify the location and intensity of painful stimulation (<b>sensory</b> <b>discrimination).</b>|$|E

40|$|What is the {{relation}} between perceptual learning (PL) in basic <b>sensory</b> <b>discriminations</b> and in more complex tasks, including real-world learning tasks? Most recent PL work focuses on the former, using simple sensory dimensions and a few specific stimulus values. In contrast, other PL research and virtually all real-world tasks involve discovery of invariance amidst variation, and may also involve PL working synergistically with other cognitive abilities. In this talk I will suggest that, despite superficial differences, low- and high-level PL tasks draw upon—and reveal—a unified type of learning. I will consider several arguments that have been advanced in favor of confining perceptual learning to plasticity at the earliest cortical levels along with models of PL based on receptive field change vs. selection. These analyses {{do not support the}} idea of a separate low-level process but do support both the abstract character of PL and its dependence on unifying notions of discovery and selection. In the final part of the talk, I will relate this unified view of PL to direct practical applications. Learning technology based on PL modules (PLMs) can address elusive aspects of learning, including pattern recognition, transfer, and fluency, even in high-level, symbolic domains, such as mathematics learning...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that there is a link between synaesthesia and autism but the nature of that link remains poorly characterised. The present study considers whether atypical sensory sensitivity may be a common link between the conditions. Sensory hypersensitivity (aversion to certain sounds, touch, etc., or increased ability to make <b>sensory</b> <b>discriminations)</b> and/or hyposensitivity (desire to stimulate the senses, or a reduced response to sensory stimuli are a recently introduced diagnostic feature of autism spectrum conditions (ASC). Synaesthesia is defined by unusual sensory experiences and has also been linked to a typical cortical hyper-excitability. The Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ) was administered to synaesthetes and people with ASC. Both groups reported increased sensory sensitivity relative to controls with a large effect size. Both groups also reported a similar pattern of both increased hyper- and hypo-sensitivities across multiple senses. The AQ (Autism-Spectrum Quotient) scores were elevated in the synaesthetes, and one subscale of this measure (attention to detail) placed synaesthetes within the autistic range. A standard laboratory test of visual stress (the Pattern Glare Test), administered online, corroborated the findings of increased sensitivity to aversive visual stimuli in synaesthetes. We conclude that atypical sensory sensitivity is an important shared feature between autism and synaesthesia...|$|R

50|$|Pribram {{suggests}} that there are two layers of cortical processing: a surface structure of separated and localized neural circuits and a deep structure of the dendritic arborization that binds the surface structure together. The deep structure contains distributed memory, while the surface structure acts as the retrieval mechanism. Binding occurs through the temporal synchronization of the oscillating polarizations in the synaptodendritic web. It had been thought that binding only occurred when there was no phase lead or lag present, but a study by Saul and Humphrey found that cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus do in fact produce these. Here phase lead and lag act to enhance <b>sensory</b> <b>discrimination,</b> acting as a frame to capture important features. These filters are also similar to the lenses necessary for holographic functioning.|$|E
50|$|A {{question}} still debated {{today is}} to what extent improvements from perceptual learning stems from peripheral modifications compared with improvement in higher-level readout stages. Early interpretations, such as that suggested by William James, attributed it to higher-level categorization mechanisms whereby initially blurred differences are gradually associated with distinctively different labels. The work focused on basic <b>sensory</b> <b>discrimination,</b> however, suggests {{that the effects of}} perceptual learning are specific to changes in low-levels of the sensory nervous system (i.e., primary sensory cortices). More recently, research suggest that perceptual learning processes are multilevel and flexible. This cycles back to the earlier Gibsonian view that low-level learning effects are modulated by high-level factors, and suggests that improvement in information extraction may not involve only low-level sensory coding but also apprehension of relatively abstract structure and relations in time and space.|$|E
40|$|Rats {{and other}} whiskered mammals {{are capable of}} making {{sophisticated}} <b>sensory</b> <b>discriminations</b> using tactile signals from their facial whiskers (vibrissae). As part of a programme of work to develop biomimetic technologies for vibrissal sensing, including whiskered robots, we are devising algorithms for the fast extraction of object parameters from whisker deflection data. Previous work has demonstrated that radial distance to contact can be estimated from forces measured {{at the base of}} the whisker shaft. We show that in the case of a moving object contacting a whisker, the measured force can be ambiguous in distinguishing a nearby object moving slowly from a more distant object moving rapidly. This ambiguity can be resolved by simultaneously extracting object position and speed from the whisker deflection time series – that is by attending to the dynamics of the whisker’s interaction with the object. We compare a simple classifier with an adaptive EM (Expectation Maximisation) classifier. Both systems are effective at simultaneously extracting the two parameters, the EM-classifier showing similar performance to a handpicked template classifier. We propose that adaptive classification algorithms can provide insights into the types of computations performed in the rat vibrissal system when the animal is faced with a discrimination task. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sensory</b> <b>discriminations,</b> such as judgements about visual motion, often {{benefit from}} multisensory evidence. Despite many reports of {{enhanced}} brain activity during multisensory conditions, {{it remains unclear}} which dynamic processes implement the multisensory benefit for an upcoming decision in the human brain. Specifically, it remains difficult to attribute perceptual benefits to specific processes, such as early sensory encoding, the transformation of sensory representations into a motor response, or to more unspecific processes such as attention. We combined an audio-visual motion discrimination task with the single-trial mapping of dynamic sensory representations in EEG activity to localize when and where multisensory congruency facilitates perceptual accuracy. Our results show that a congruent sound facilitates the encoding of motion direction in occipital sensory - as opposed to parieto-frontal - cortices, and facilitates later - as opposed to early (i. e. below 100 ms) - sensory activations. This multisensory enhancement was visible as an earlier rise of motion-sensitive activity in middle-occipital regions about 350 ms from stimulus onset, which reflected the better discriminability of motion direction from brain activity and correlated with the perceptual benefit provided by congruent multisensory information. This supports a hierarchical model of multisensory integration in which the enhancement of relevant sensory cortical representations {{is transformed into a}} more accurate choice...|$|R

The starting point of this rather general belief was their discovery of “the law of small numbers ” i. e. their discovery that the pitch of a string is simply related to its length.
