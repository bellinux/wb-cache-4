25|$|It {{is common}} to combine fMRI signal {{acquisition}} with tracking of participants' responses and reaction times. Physiological measures such heart rate, breathing, skin conductance (rate of sweating), and eye movements are sometimes captured simultaneously with fMRI. The method can also be combined with other brain-imaging techniques such as transcranial stimulation, direct cortical stimulation and, especially, EEG. The fMRI procedure can also be combined with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to have <b>supplementary</b> <b>information</b> about both oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin.|$|E

500|$|Aristotle {{has been}} called unscientific by {{philosophers}} from Francis Bacon onwards {{for at least two}} reasons: his scientific style, and his use of explanation. His explanations are in turn made cryptic by his complicated system of causes. However, these charges need to be considered in the light of what was known in his own time. His systematic gathering of data, too, is obscured by the lack of modern methods of presentation, such as tables of data: for example, the whole of History of Animals Book VI is taken up with a list of observations of the life histories of birds that [...] "would now be summarized in a single table in Nature – and in the Online <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Information</b> at that".|$|E

40|$|We define in {{this paper}} several Hopf algebras {{describing}} the combinatorics of the so-called multi-scale renormalization in quantum field theory. After a brief recall of the main mathematical features of multi-scale renormalization, we define assigned graphs, that are graphs with appropriate decorations for the multi-scale framework. We then define Hopf algebras on these assigned graphs and on the Gallavotti-Nicolò trees, particular class of trees encoding the <b>supplementary</b> <b>informations</b> of the assigned graphs. Several morphisms between these combinatorial Hopf algebras and the Connes-Kreimer algebra are given. Finally, scale dependent couplings are analyzed via this combinatorial algebraic setting.

6000|$|The best {{speech on}} the affairs of Cracow, for example, the most {{vigorous}} and the best informed, touching all the points with a thorough acquaintance, was that of Lord George Bentinck. The discussion on Cracow, which lasted several nights and followed very shortly after the defeat of his Irish bill, appeared to relate to a class of subjects which would not have engaged his attention; but on the contrary, he had given days and nights to this theme, had critically examined all the documents, and conferred with those qualified to supply him with any <b>supplementary</b> <b>information</b> requisite. He spoke several times this session on questions connected with our foreign affairs, and always impressed the House with a conviction that he was addressing it after a due study of his subject: as for example, his speech against our interference in Portugal, and the statement in which he brought forward {{the claims of the}} holders of Spanish bonds on the government of Spain before the House of Commons. In the instance of Portugal, a motion of censure on the conduct of ministers had been introduced by Mr. Hume, and the government were only saved from a minority by the friendly interposition of Mr. Duncombe, who proposed an amendment to the motion of Mr. Hume which broke the line of the liberal force. Lord George Bentinck in this case followed Mr. Macaulay, whose speech, as was his wont, had been rich in historical illustration. 'The right honourable and learned member for Edinburgh,' Lord George replied, 'had entered into a very interesting history of various interferences which had taken place in the affairs of Portugal; but in making that statement he forgot to mention one circumstance which had occurred in that history, and it was this ...|$|E
