5|$|The {{second child}} of Johnstone Melmore and Jessie Francis Leech, Leech {{was born in}} Bendigo in Australia. She was given the name Faith after her elder sister, who died from leukaemia {{at the age of}} two. A {{delicate}} child, Leech had an aversion to eating {{in the first two years}} of her life, <b>so</b> <b>her</b> mother fed her in small hourly doses. Leech was twice rushed from the family home to a Melbourne hospital. Conventional medicine failed to rectify Leech's dietary issues, <b>so</b> <b>her</b> mother put her on a fast for ten days at the recommendation of a naturopath. Leech was later placed on a diet of fruit, salad and vegetables, with an emphasis on beetroot juice and carrot juice.|$|E
5|$|After much contemplation, {{she chose}} not to abdicate. Joseph himself often {{threatened}} to resign as co-regent and emperor, but he, too, was induced not to do <b>so.</b> <b>Her</b> threats of abdication were rarely taken seriously; Maria Theresa believed that her recovery from smallpox in 1767 {{was a sign that}} God wished her to reign until death. It was in Joseph's interest that she remained sovereign, for he often blamed her for his failures and thus avoided taking on the responsibilities of a monarch.|$|E
5|$|During the Games, Romanian gymnast Andreea Răducan won {{the gold}} in women's artistic {{individual}} all-around, so she stripped her gold medal after she tested a banned positive substance. As <b>so,</b> <b>her</b> teammates Simona Amânar and Maria Olaru, originally won silver and bronze, upgraded to gold and silver, respectively. While Chinese gymnast Liu Xuan moved up to bronze.

60|$|Who {{does not}} know that estimable housewife, working from eight till twelve to keep the house in what she calls order? She is so good a woman, so untiring, so unselfish, so conscientious, <b>so</b> irritating. <b>Her</b> rooms are <b>so</b> clean, <b>her</b> {{servants}} <b>so</b> well managed, <b>her</b> children <b>so</b> well dressed, <b>her</b> dinners <b>so</b> well cooked; the whole house so uninviting.

5|$|The UK Film Council {{awarded the}} {{production}} £1million in June 2009. Filming began in December 2009, and lasted 39 days. Most {{was shot in}} the three weeks before Christmas because Rush would be performing in a play in January. The schedule was further complicated by Bonham Carter's availability: she worked on Harry Potter during the week, <b>so</b> <b>her</b> scenes had to be filmed during the weekend.|$|E
5|$|The {{water was}} pumped {{out through the}} joint efforts of a local fire company and the shipyard, and Prince of Wales was later dry docked for {{permanent}} repairs. This damage and {{the problem with the}} delivery of her main guns and turrets delayed her completion. As the war progressed there was an urgent need for capital ships, and <b>so</b> <b>her</b> completion was advanced by postponing compartment air tests, ventilation tests and a thorough testing of her bilge, ballast and fuel-oil systems.|$|E
50|$|In 2372, Odo marries a pregnant, {{recently}} divorced Lwaxana Troi as a {{favor to}} <b>her,</b> <b>so</b> that <b>her</b> child will not be taken away from her at birth by the father, as required by Tavnian law.

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the repatriation effort, Montana was transferred to the west coast of the United States. She arrived in the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Seattle on 16 August, where she remained until 2 February 1921, when she was decommissioned. During this period of inactivity, she was renamed Missoula on 7 June 1920 <b>so</b> <b>her</b> original name could be used for one of the planned South Dakota-class battleships, and she reclassified with the hull number CA-13. Though decommissioned in 1921, the ship remained in the Navy's inventory until 15 July 1930, when she was formally stricken from the naval register, according to the terms of the London Naval Treaty, which placed aggregate tonnage limits on the cruiser fleets of the signatory countries. She was sold to John Irwin Jr. on 29 September and was eventually broken up in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Damned to the Netherealm {{after her}} death, Mileena swears fealty to its ruler Shinnok. During {{the events of}} Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), Shao Kahn decides to resurrect Mileena <b>so</b> <b>her</b> skills as a vicious fighter would help him defeat Earth's chosen warriors, also magically {{granting}} her {{the ability to read}} Kitana's thoughts. Shinnok sees {{this as an opportunity to}} covertly monitor the events unfolding in Earthrealm and so he allows her to return to life. After Kahn is defeated, Mileena is summoned back to the Netherealm. In Mortal Kombat Gold (1999), she assists in Shinnok's invasion of Edenia, but allows her sister to escape from a dungeon. Following Shinnok's defeat, Mileena comes to Kitana's palace and demands the power over Edenia be shared with her. Kitana refuses and, when attacked, traps Mileena and locks her away in a dungeon.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Hipper {{organized}} {{the office of}} Befehlshabers der Sicherung der Nordsee (BSNCommander of the Defense of the North Sea), which was also stationed on Niobe. In 1917, she was disarmed <b>so</b> <b>her</b> guns {{could be used to}} reinforce the defenses of Wilhelmshaven. In October that year, Konteradmiral Friedrich Boedicker, then the commander of the I Squadron, came aboard Niobe; the bulk of the High Seas Fleet had gone into the Baltic to launch Operation Albion, and Boedicker temporarily took control of the BSN. Hipper and his staff left Niobe on 11 August 1918, having been promoted to command of the High Seas Fleet. The BSN remained aboard Niobe until January 1919, two months after the war ended with the Armistice; it was then transferred to the old pre-dreadnought battleship , also in use as a headquarters ship. Niobe was then decommissioned on 3 February.|$|E

5|$|Gimmick! is a {{platform}} game that places the player {{in control of}} a small green blob named Yumetaro. The story begins during an unnamed young girl's birthday. Her father is normally busy with work but {{he is able to}} spend time with his family for the special occasion. Earlier, he had went to the store to purchase a new toy for his daughter. Yumetaro had been wandering the toy store and became confused when the father came in. He hid with stuffed toys that looked like him, but was picked up by the girl's father. When the girl opens the Yumetaro gift, she is delighted. Yumetaro becomes the girl's favorite, and <b>so</b> <b>her</b> other toys no longer feel loved. One night, the toys come alive and take the girl to another dimension. The only one left is Yumetaro, who follows the toys in search of the girl.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September 2006, it was {{revealed}} {{that as a result of}} appeals brought by prosecutors and heard by the Supreme Court, Chen had the death penalty reimposed after his reduced sentence of life imprisonment was overturned. Rush, Nguyen and Norman also had their appeal verdicts overturned and the death penalty imposed. The new death sentences were unexpected. Prosecutors, in their appeals against the 20-year terms faced by most of the nine, had only called for them to be upgraded to life imprisonment. Czugaj's life sentence, after being reduced to 20 years on appeal, was reinstated. Stephens' life sentence was upheld on appeal as were Sukumaran's and Chan's death sentences. Lawrence had not lodged a further appeal to her 20-year sentence, <b>so</b> <b>her</b> sentence was not rejudged.|$|E
5|$|Preussen {{served with}} the fleet from her {{commissioning}} until 1891, though she was frequently placed in reserve throughout her career. She cruised the Mediterranean Sea several times during her service, including during a mission in 1877 after unrest in the Ottoman Empire threatened German citizens living there. The ship was withdrawn from service {{at the end of}} 1891 and used as a harbor guard ship until 1896, when she was relegated to being a supply ship in Wilhelmshaven. She ended her career as a coal hulk for torpedo boats. In 1903, she was renamed Saturn <b>so</b> <b>her</b> name could be reused. The ship was ultimately sold to shipbreakers in 1919.|$|E

5|$|That month, Lovato also {{announced}} her departure from Sonny with a Chance, putting her acting career on hiatus and ending the series; she later {{said that she}} would return to acting when she felt confident doing <b>so.</b> <b>Her</b> departure led to the spin-off series So Random! with the Sonny cast, featuring sketches from the former show-within-a-show. The series was cancelled after one season. Lovato released her third album, Unbroken, on September 20, 2011. Begun in July 2010, the album experimented with R and featured less pop rock. The album and the stylistic change received mixed reviews from critics, who saw a growth in musicianship because of her struggles and have praised Lovato's vocals but found the music more generic than her previous efforts. The record was a commercial success, peaking at number four on the Billboard 200, with sales exceeding 97,000 copies in its first week of release, and going on to sell over 500,000 copies in the United States, being certified Gold.|$|E
5|$|The Lives formed {{part of the}} Cabinet of Biography in the Cabinet Cyclopaedia. Within the set of ten, the three-volume Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal (1835–37) and the two-volume Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of France (1838–39) {{consist of}} biographies of {{important}} writers and thinkers of the 14th to 18th centuries. Most of them were written by the Romantic writer Mary Shelley. Shelley's biographies reveal her as a professional woman of letters, contracted to produce several volumes of works and paid well to do <b>so.</b> <b>Her</b> extensive knowledge of history and languages, her ability to tell a gripping biographical narrative, and her interest in the burgeoning field of feminist historiography are reflected in these works.|$|E
5|$|The {{boys and}} Candace {{return to a}} muddy area where the T. rex has left a massive footprint, which they {{recognize}} will eventually be {{on display in the}} museum in the present. Phineas leaves a message in the footprint for Isabella and the Fireside Girls to save them. The girls—in the present—immediately spot the footprint and the message and follow their handbook to create a new time machine. They use the machine to travel back in time and rescue the three. Upon arrival in the present, though, they realize a T. rex returned with them, so Candace flees and tries to expose it to her parents. A stray ray from Doofenshmirtz's machine freezes the creature, <b>so</b> <b>her</b> parents merely believe it is an exhibit.|$|E

In January 2007, Jack Neo considered making a movie about the murder, but both families objected.
