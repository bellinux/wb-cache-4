40|$|In {{this paper}} {{contemporary}} literature on <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> education is examined in an integrative and analytical manner. To achieve this, an empirical investigation on <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> education was undertaken. As {{the goal is}} to understand and propose specific research directions, the findings are both descriptive and analytical. Initially, peer reviewed journal articles that had been published relating to <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> education were identified. Such a list provides a valuable insight into contributions to this area of research and serves as the foundation for the paper's other purposes. The second purpose was to analyse <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> education publications over time (1980 - 2005), to see how the topic has evolved. Third, an integrative analysis of works on <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> education allowed an identification of needs for future research. The over-riding purpose of this paper was to ensure that there was an understanding of the contributions and their limitations, so that research on <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> education can progress with an appreciation of the past...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{encourage}} selective {{use of a}} complex categorisation strategy. More specifically, participants will be trained to use a two dimensional <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> one region of category space and a more complex three-dimensional <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> another region of category space. In the 2 – 3 conditions, participants will be presented with stimuli requiring the two-dimensional <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> {{the first phase of}} training and the three-dimensional <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> the second phase of training. In the 3 - 2 conditions, participants will be presented with stimuli requiring the three-dimensional <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> the first phase of training and the two-dimensional <b>strategy</b> <b>in</b> the second phase of training. The main dependent measure will be performance on exceptions to the two-dimensional strategy. If participants learn to selectively use the three-dimensional strategy, then we expect them to correctly classify novel exceptions that occur in the three-dimensional region of the category space and incorrectly classify novel exceptions that occur in the two-dimensional region of the category space...|$|R

Players play as Jack Joyce, who has time {{manipulation}} powers {{in a world}} where time stutters, making everything freeze except Joyce. Players face a variety of enemies, including Monarch security guards; Strikers, who are equipped with specially-designed suits which allow them to manipulate time; and Juggernauts, heavily armored enemies equipped with very strong firearms. Different enemies have different behaviors, and the game requires players to deploy different tactics and <b>strategies</b> <b>in</b> order to defeat them.|$|E

Other writings of the period include Symbols of Class Status (1951) and On Cooling the Mark Out (1952).
