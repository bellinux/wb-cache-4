5000|$|Friedrich Natalis (1864-1935), who {{had been}} working for the Schuckert-Werke (later Siemens-Schuckertwerke) since 1897, had already {{developed}} the cam-switching principle in Germany before 1900. In 1895, however, Johann Sigmund Schuckert founder of the electrical engineering company Schuckert & Co supplied <b>cam</b> <b>switches</b> with <b>cam</b> rollers and spring-loaded individual switches (DRP 88586). Thus the term <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> has been used for such and similar devices over the years. Schuckert also supplied the [...] "carbon control switch" [...] designed by Natalis since 1901 with copper-carbon switching devices with spark-blowers (common spark blowers for direct current or single-spark blowers for direct and alternating current). The main current <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> retained some significance, even when the rifle control pushed it where it was more economical. In miniature machine construction, the <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> probably did not appear until the early 1930s. In 1931 the American company General Electric GE released their switch SBl, a 20A auxiliary current control switch, basically a miniaturized image of the large main current control switches. The devices had simple interruption and silver crossover, in some cases they were equipped with a snap mechanism. in Europe around 1940, the first <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> from Ghielmetti, Solothurn / Switzerland, began to replace conventional roller switches. Switches could also be supplied as auxiliary current control switches with corresponding circuits. They were marketed under the trade name Ghielmetti-Clavier. In September 1948, Kraus & Naimer(of Vienna) produced C15(15 A), the first company-owned <b>cam</b> <b>switch.</b> In 1949, the company also presented the world's first cam-designed <b>cam</b> <b>switch.</b> At the beginning of 1950, Kraus & Naimer <b>cam</b> <b>switches</b> C30 (30A) were followed with the same design. The Kraus & Naimer <b>cam</b> <b>switches</b> C16 to C200, which came into the market in the spring of 1951, had a decisive influence on the advancement of the <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> and the introduction of the roller switch in electrical engineering. They had a double interruption and a motor switching capacity appropriate to the rated current. The large number of possible combinations and the extensive additional equipment as characteristic features were responsible for the later development of <b>cam</b> <b>switches</b> as an industrial standard. Kraus & Naimer developed the world's smallest <b>cam</b> <b>switch</b> (model CA4N), which is in the market since 1994.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{a hybrid}} {{combustion}} mode in four-stroke {{gasoline direct injection}} engines was studied. <b>Switching</b> <b>cam</b> profiles and injection strategies simultaneously was adopted to obtain a rapid and smooth switch between SI mode and HCCI mode. Based on the continuous pressure traces and corresponding emissions, HCCI steady operation, HCCI transient process (combustion phase adjustment, SI-HCCI, HCCI-SI, HCCI cold start) were studied. In HCCI mode, HCCI combustion phase can be adjusted rapidly by changing the split injection ratio. The HCCI control strategies had been demonstrated in a Chery GDI 2. 0 engine. The HCCI engine simulation results show that, oxygen and active radicals are stored due to negative valve overlap and split fuel injection under learn burn condition. This reduces the HCCI sensitivity on inlet boundary conditions, such as intake charge and intake temperature. The engine can be run from 1500 rpm to 4000 rpm in HCCI mode without spark ignition.

40|$|Crassulacean acid {{metabolism}} (CAM) photosynthesis is {{an adaptation}} to water and atmospheric CO 2 deficits {{that has been}} linked to diversification in dry-adapted plants. We investigated whether CAM evolution can be associated with the availability of new or alternative niches, using Eulophiinae orchids as a case study. Carbon isotope ratios, geographical and climate data, fossil records and DNA sequences were used to: assess the prevalence of CAM in Eulophiinae orchids; characterize the ecological niche of extant taxa; infer divergence times; and estimate whether CAM is associated with niche shifts. CAM evolved in four terrestrial lineages during the late Miocene/Pliocene, which have uneven diversification patterns. These lineages originated in humid habitats and colonized dry/seasonally dry environments in Africa and Madagascar. Additional key features (variegation, heterophylly) evolved in the most species-rich CAM lineages. Dry habitats were also colonized by a lineage that includes putative mycoheterotrophic taxa. These findings indicate that the <b>switch</b> to <b>CAM</b> is associated with environmental change.

40|$|Effective WiFi power {{management}} can strongly impact the energy consumption on Smartphones. Through controlled experiments, {{we find that}} WiFi {{power management}} {{on a wide variety}} of Smartphones is a largely autonomous process that is processed completely at the driver level. Driver level implementations suffer from the limitation that important power management decisions can be made only by observing packets at the MAC layer. This approach has the unfortunate side effect that each application has equal opportunity to impact WiFi power management to consume more energy, since distinguishing between applications is not feasible at the MAC layer. The power cost difference between WiFi power modes is high (a factor of 20 times when idle), therefore determining which applications are permitted to impact WiFi power management is an important and relevant problem. In this paper we propose SAPSM: Smart Adaptive Power Save Mode. SAPSM labels each application with a priority with the assistance of a machine learning classifier. Only high priority applications affect the client’s behavior to <b>switch</b> to <b>CAM</b> or Active mode, while low priority traffic is optimized for energy efficiency.

40|$|The {{actomyosin}} cytoskeleton is {{a highly}} dynamic complex of proteins which facilitate diverse processes within the cell. It is regulated by a network of signalling pathways to coordinate growth and division in response {{to changes in the}} extracellular environment. A wide range of actin binding proteins control the organisation and dynamics of the actin network within eukaryotic cells. This study explored the function of signalling dependent phosphorylation events on two S. pombe actin binding proteins, the actin capping protein, Acp 1, and the class I myosin, Myo 1. Disruption of the TOR-signaling complex, TORC 2, results in defects in the formation and constriction of the cytokinetic actomyosin ring (CAR). This study explores the localisation of TORC 2 to the CAR, and the function of TORC 2 dependent phosphorylation of Acp 1. Data shows that phosphorylation of Acp 1 functions to regulate the stability and cellular organization of the actin cytoskeleton. This allows a cell to couple growth and division with changes in the environment. Similarly, a conserved serine residue in the IQ motif of the neck region of Myo 1 was shown to be TORC 2 -dependent. Fission yeast express two calmodulin-like light chains, Cam 1 and Cam 2, which are capable of associating with the IQ domains of Myo 1. The location of this phosphorylation site, between the two IQ motifs, provides a potential mechanism of determining which light chain associates with Myo 1. This study provides evidence that this TORC 2 -dependent phosphorylation event is cell cycle dependent, and may result in a <b>switch</b> between <b>Cam</b> 1 and Cam 2 binding. These potentially conserved mechanisms of regulating the organization of the actomyosin cytoskeleton provide an important insight into the system of control networks that regulate cell growth and division in response to changes in the extracellular environment...|$|R

To investigate the structural basis of CaM regulation of the RyR 1 isoform, we used site-directed labeling of channel regulatory subunits and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Donor fluorophore was targeted to the RyR 1 cytoplasmic assembly by preincubating sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes with a fluorescent FK 506 -binding protein (FKBP), and FRET was determined following incubations {{in the presence of}} fluorescent CaMs in which acceptor fluorophore was attached within the N lobe, central linker, or C lobe.
