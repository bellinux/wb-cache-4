40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{basic capacity}} calculation methods for circuit switched, multiple-beam, {{low earth orbit}} (LEO) communication satellites that use MF-TDMA and MF-CDMA schemes. Capacity is de¯ned {{as the number of}} simultaneous duplex channels that a satellite can support for a given data rate and bit error rate. This paper integrates the bandwidth limit and the power limit on capacity, and derives the equations by which the capacity of a MF-TDMA or a MF-CDMA system can be calculated using key system parameters. Therefore, these methods enable system designers to quickly estimate the communication system capacity when key system parameters are known. The paper uses the Iridium and Globalstar systems for benchmarking by comparing the results obtained from the analytical methods with the 1, 100 and 2, 5000 simultaneous channels reported by Iridium and Globalstar, respectively. The analytic capacity estimate matches reported single <b>satellite</b> <b>capacities</b> to within 6 %, but the predictions are sensitive to various loss assumptions made in the link budget...|$|R

50|$|Home users {{tend to use}} shared <b>satellite</b> <b>capacity</b> {{to reduce}} the cost, while still {{allowing}} high peak bit rates when congestion is absent. There are usually restrictive time-based bandwidth allowances so that each user gets their fair share, according to their payment. When a user exceeds their allowance, the company may slow down their access, deprioritise their traffic or charge for the excess bandwidth used. For consumer satellite Internet, the allowance can typically range from 200 MB per day to 25 GB per month. A shared download carrier may have a bit rate of 1 to 40 Mbit/s and be shared by up to 100 to 4,000 end users.|$|E
50|$|Hosted {{payloads}} {{are used}} most often by government agencies seeking to have communications capability in orbit {{without having to}} pay {{the cost of building}} and launching an entire government-owned satellite. Using a hosted payload on a commercial satellite can reduce both the expense and time required to get communications capacity into space. However, because some government agencies desire to own and control entire satellite platforms, hosted payloads have not been widely accepted by government space planners, despite the fact that a large proportion of government satellite communications is over commercially owned and operated satellites. For example, according to Space Commerce, over 80% of all U.S. government and military satellite communications goes through commercial services. Hosted payloads give government agencies the ability to own and control a portion of a <b>satellite’s</b> <b>capacity.</b> In 2007, the US Department of Defense projected that satellite demand for the next 10-13 years would increase much more rapidly than the government could build and launch its own satellite systems, making hosted payloads on commercial satellites an attractive alternative.|$|R
40|$|Multi-echelon {{distribution}} {{systems are}} quite common in supply-chain and logistic systems. They {{are used by}} public administrations in their transportation and traffic planning strategies {{as well as by}} companies to model their distribution systems. Unfortunately, the literature on com- binatorial optimization methods for multi-echelon distribution systems is very poor. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it introduces the family of Multi-Echelon Vehicle Routing Problems. Second, the Two-Echelon Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, is presented. The Two-Echelon Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (2 E-CVRP) is an extension of the classical VRP where the delivery passes through intermediate depots (called satellites). As in the classical VRP, the goal is to deliver goods to customers with known demands, minimizing the total delivery cost while considering vehicle and <b>satellites</b> <b>capacity</b> constraints. A mathematical model for 2 E-CVRP is presented and some valid in- equalities given, which are able to significantly improve the results on benchmark tests up to 50 customers and 5 satellites. Computational re- sults under different realistic scenarios are presented...|$|R
