In this study we investigated the production of dThdPase/platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor in gastric cancer quantitatively.

The amount of dThdPase was significantly higher in the tumour tissue than in the normal tissue. Intratumoural dThdPase concentrations were significantly higher in Borrmann types I and II macroscopically, in poorly differentiated and <b>solid</b> <b>type</b> histologically, <b>in</b> the medullary type of the tumour stroma, and in the tumour-invading serosa.

By immunohistochemical study, dThdPase expression on tumour cells was observed in all seven specimens with high dThdPase protein levels, but not in all 14 cases with low dThdPase protein levels (P < 0. 05).

The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in differentiating malignant from benign ovarian masses. A comprehensive literature search was performed in several authoritative databases to identify relevant articles. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and corresponding 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) were calculated. We also used subgroup analysis to analyze study heterogeneity, and evaluated publication bias.

There {{was no significant difference}} in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values for DWI between benign and malignant lesions (WMD = 0. 22, 95 % CI = - 0. 02 - 0. 47, p = 0. 08). Subgroup analysis by benign tumor type revealed higher ADC values (or a trend toward higher values) for cysts, cystadenomas and other benign tumors compared to malignant masses (cyst: WMD = 0. 54, 95 % CI = - 0. 05 - 1. 12, p = 0. 07; cystadenoma: WMD = 0. 73, 95 % CI = 0. 38 - 1. 07, p < 0. 0001; other benign tumor: WMD = 0. 16, 95 % CI = - 0. 13 - 0. 46, p = 0. 28).

5000|$|Polarization (also polarisation) is a {{property}} applying to transverse waves that specifies the geometrical {{orientation of the}} oscillations. [...] In a transverse wave, {{the direction of the}} oscillation is transverse to the direction of motion of the wave, so the oscillations can have different directions perpendicular to the wave direction. [...] A simple example of a polarized transverse wave is vibrations traveling along a taut string (see image); for example, in a musical instrument like a guitar string. Depending on how the string is plucked, the vibrations can be in a vertical direction, horizontal direction, or at any angle perpendicular to the string. In contrast, in longitudinal waves, such as sound waves in a liquid or gas, the displacement of the particles in the oscillation is always in the direction of propagation, so these waves do not exhibit polarization. Transverse waves that exhibit polarization include electromagnetic waves such as light and radio waves, gravitational waves, and transverse sound waves (shear waves) <b>in</b> <b>solids.</b> <b>In</b> some <b>types</b> of transverse waves, the wave displacement is limited to a single direction, so these also do not exhibit polarization; for example, in surface waves in liquids (gravity waves), the wave displacement of the particles is always in a vertical plane.|$|R

We study the problem of the conductivity of Tamm-Shockley edge states through direct transport experiments. Aharonov-Bohm magneto-oscillations of resistance are found on graphene samples that contain a single nanohole. The effect is explained by the conductivity of the massless Dirac fermions in the edge states cycling around the nanohole.
