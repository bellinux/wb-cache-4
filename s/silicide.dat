5|$|Beryllium nitride, Be3N2 is a {{high-melting-point}} compound {{which is}} readily hydrolyzed. Beryllium azide, BeN6 is known and beryllium phosphide, Be3P2 {{has a similar}} structure to Be3N2. Basic beryllium nitrate and basic beryllium acetate have similar tetrahedral structures with four beryllium atoms coordinated to a central oxide ion. A number of beryllium borides are known, such as Be5B, Be4B, Be2B, BeB2, BeB6 and BeB12. Beryllium carbide, Be2C, is a refractory brick-red compound that reacts with water to give methane. No beryllium <b>silicide</b> has been identified.|$|E

It does not form a boride, <b>silicide,</b> or carbide, and the hydride InH3 has at best a transitory existence in ethereal solutions at low temperatures, being unstable enough to spontaneously polymerize without coordination. Indium is rather basic in aqueous solution, showing only slight amphoteric characteristics, and unlike its lighter homologs aluminium and gallium, it is insoluble in aqueous alkaline solutions.|$|E
25|$|Polysilicon {{is not a}} great {{conductor}} (approximately 1000 {{times more}} resistive than metals) which reduces the signal propagation speed through the material. The resistivity can be lowered by increasing the level of doping, but even highly doped polysilicon is not as conductive as most metals. To improve conductivity further, sometimes a high-temperature metal such as tungsten, titanium, cobalt, and more recently nickel is alloyed with the top layers of the polysilicon. Such a blended material is called <b>silicide.</b> The silicide-polysilicon combination has better electrical properties than polysilicon alone and still does not melt in subsequent processing. Also the threshold voltage is not significantly higher than with polysilicon alone, because the <b>silicide</b> material is not near the channel. The process in which <b>silicide</b> is formed on both the gate electrode and the source and drain regions is sometimes called salicide, self-aligned <b>silicide.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{microwave}} absorption {{properties of}} Ni/(C, <b>silicides)</b> nanocapsules prepared by an arc discharge method have been studied. The composition and the microstructure of the Ni/(C, <b>silicides)</b> nanocapsules {{were determined by}} means of X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscope observations. <b>Silicides,</b> in the forms of SiOx and SiC, mainly exist in the shells of the nanocapsules and result in {{a large amount of}} defects at the ‘core/shell’ interfaces {{as well as in the}} shells. The complex permittivity and microwave absorption properties of the Ni/(C, <b>silicides)</b> nanocapsules are improved by the doped <b>silicides.</b> Compared with those of Ni/C nanocapsules, the positions of maximum absorption peaks of the Ni/(C, <b>silicides)</b> nanocapsules exhibit large red shifts.

25|$|In general, the alkaline-earth metals form {{silicides}} {{with the}} following stoichiometries: MII2Si, MIISi, and MIISi2.

25|$|Products often {{vary with}} the {{stoichiometry}} of the <b>silicide</b> reactant. For example, Ca2Si is polar and non-conducting and has the anti-PbCl2 structure with single isolated silicon atoms, and reacts with water to produce calcium hydroxide, hydrated silicon dioxide, and hydrogen gas. CaSi with its zigzag chains of silicon atoms instead reacts to give silanes and polymeric SiH2, while CaSi2 with its puckered layers of silicon atoms does not react with water, but will react with dilute hydrochloric acid: the product is a yellow polymeric solid with stoichiometry Si2H2O.|$|E

The two kinds of nanocapsule-paraffin composites demonstrate attractive microwave absorption properties. When inclusions of <b>silicides</b> are introduced into Ni/(C, <b>silicides)</b> nanocapsules, the absorption peaks of the Ni/(C, <b>silicides)</b> nanocapsule-paraffin composite have a red shift of 0.7 to 1.9 GHz {{compared with those of}} the Ni/C nanocapsule-paraffin composite. We propose a simple electric dipole model which semi-quantitatively explains the red shift phenomenon. The RL peak value for the Ni/(C, silicides)-paraffin composite with a layer thickness of 2 mm has increased to about − 37 dB at 13.8 GHz compared with that of − 13 dB at 15.6 GHz for the Ni/C nanocapsules-paraffin composite.|$|R
