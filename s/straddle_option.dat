40|$|Volatility risk {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the management of portfolios of derivative assets as well as portfolios of basic assets. This risk is currently managed by volatility "swaps" or futures. However, this risk could be managed more efficiently using options on volatility that were proposed in the past but were never introduced mainly due to the lack of a cost efficient tradable underlying asset. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new volatility instrument, an option on a straddle, which can be used to hedge volatility risk. The design and valuation of such an instrument are the basic ingredients of a successful financial product. In order to value these options, we combine the approaches of compound options and stochastic volatility. Our numerical results show that the <b>straddle</b> <b>option</b> is a powerful instrument to hedge volatility risk. An additional benefit of such an innovation is that it will provide a direct estimate of the market price for volatility risk. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Volatility risk {{has played}} a major role in several {{financial}} debacles (for example, Barings Bank, Long Term Capital Management). This risk could have been managed using options on volatility which were proposed in the past but were never offered for trading mainly due to the lack of a tradable underlying asset. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new volatility instrument, an option on a straddle, which can be used to hedge volatility risk. The design and valuation of such an instrument are the basic ingredients of a successful financial product. Unlike the proposed volatility index option, the underlying of this proposed contract is a traded atthe -money-forward straddle, which should be more appealing to potential participants. In order to value these options, we combine the approaches of compound options and stochastic volatility. We use the lognormal process for the underlying asset, the Orenstein-Uhlenbeck process for volatility, and assume that the two Brownian motions are independent. Our numerical results show that the <b>straddle</b> <b>option</b> price is very sensitive to the changes in volatility which means that the proposed contract is indeed a very powerful instrument to hedge volatility risk...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Value at Risk (VaR) {{provides}} {{a number that}} measures {{the risk of a}} financial portfolio under significant loss. The Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful tool for estimating VaR. However, the Monte Carlo simulation is inefficient since the event of significant loss is usually rare. Glasserman et al. suggest that the performance can be improved by importance sampling [4, 5]. To be brief, they sample the stock prices from a new probability measure where the event of significant loss is more likely to happen than in the original one. However, their technique might perform poorly for some complex portfolios like shorting <b>straddle</b> <b>options.</b> Shorting <b>straddle</b> <b>options</b> suffers significant loss when there is a significant increase or decrease in the underlying stock price. Thus tilting the probability measure of the stock price to make one huge-loss event, says a significant decrease in the stock price, more likely to happen will make the other event (a significant increase in the stock price) much more rare. The hybrid importance sampling algorithm suggested in this paper can efficiently estimate the VaR for complex portfolios. Take shorting <b>straddle</b> <b>options</b> for example, our algorithm can be decomposed into two sub simulations. Each sub simulation focuses on one huge-loss event like the significant decrease (or increase) in the stock price and tilts the probability measure to asymptotically minimize the variance for estimating the probability of that event. We proceed to minimize the variance for estimating the probability of significant loss given a limit on total computational time. The number of stock price samples serves as a proxy of computational time and the allotment of samples to each sub simulation is then properly determined by Lagrange’s multiplier. Our paper will demonstrate how the hybrid importance sampling method is applied to estimate the VaR of shorting <b>straddle</b> <b>options</b> by assuming that the stock price follows the Merton’s jump diffusion process [7]. Numerical experiments are given to verify the superiority of our method...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} the {{performance}} of volatility options as hedging instruments for hedging volatility risk. We investigate (a) the relative hedging performance of volatility and European options, (b) the relative hedging performance of volatility index and <b>straddle</b> <b>options,</b> and (c) the impact of model misspecification on hedging effectiveness. Our focus is on exotic options as the options to be hedged, because they are more sensitive to volatility risk and model risk and practically more relevant when the effectiveness of different hedging strategies is examined. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we find that volatility options are especially useful for hedging options with a severe exotic feature and there is {{no significant difference between the}} performances of volatility index and <b>straddle</b> <b>options.</b> Furthermore, our results indicate that model misspecification has an important impact on the hedging performance.

50|$|The long {{strangle}} involves going long (buying) both a call option and a put option {{of the same}} underlying security. Like a <b>straddle,</b> the <b>options</b> expire at the same time, but unlike a <b>straddle,</b> the <b>options</b> have different strike prices. A strangle can be less expensive than a straddle if the strike prices are out-of-the-money.

Thus, an investor may take a long strangle position if he thinks the underlying security is highly volatile, but does not know which direction it is going to move. This position is a limited risk, since the most a purchaser may lose is the cost of both options. At the same time, there is unlimited profit potential.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the use of GARCH models, Neural Network Regression (NNR), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) {{regression}} and model combinations for forecasting and trading currency volatility, with an application to the GBP/USD and USD/JPY exchange rates. Both {{the results of the}} NNR/RNN models and the model combination results are benchmarked against the simpler GARCH alternative. The idea of developing a nonlinear nonparametric approach to forecast FX volatility, identify mispriced options and subsequently develop a trading strategy based upon this process is intuitively appealing. Using daily data from December 1993 through April 1999, we develop alternative FX volatility forecasting models. These models are then tested out-of-sample over the period April 1999 -May 2000, {{not only in terms of}} forecasting accuracy, but also in terms of trading efficiency: In order to do so, we apply a realistic volatility trading strategy using FX <b>option</b> <b>straddles</b> once mispriced <b>options</b> have been identified. Allowing for transaction costs, most trading strategies retained produce positive returns. RNN models appear as the best single modelling approach yet, somewhat surprisingly, model combination which has the best overall performance in terms of forecasting accuracy, fails to improve the RNN-based volatility trading results. Another conclusion from our results is that, for the period and currencies considered, the currency option market was inefficient and/or the pricing formulae applied by market participants were inadequate...|$|R

With differing transaction costs structure between traders, the directional bets taken by the models of the market maker for the most part appear successful, reaping large positive returns.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} trading of {{at-the-money}} <b>straddles</b> using <b>options</b> on foreign currency futures, namely British Pound, Canadian Dollar, and Japanese Yen. The financial performance and economic significance of a direct profit forecast trading strategy are examined. This strategy uses a linear projection to directly forecast the profit (net of transaction costs) of engaging in a straddle. The straddle is purchased when the forecast is positive and sold when negative. This differs from the conventional option trading strategy of basing trading decisions on a two-step procedure of first generating a volatility forecast and then inputting the volatility forecast into an appropriate option pricing model to price the straddle. The direct profit forecast trading strategy removes volatility forecasting and option pricing models from the straddle trading decision process altogether. This method has only one source of model risk, compared to the conventional two step method which has two sources of model risk. It {{is possible that the}} direct forecast trading strategy with only one source of model risk may outperform the conventional method of trading straddles. The experimental investigation confirms this notion and the out-of-sample results indicate that, for each of the currencies analysed, the direct forecasting strategy is more profitable than the conventional two-step method. Furthermore, the results are robust with respect to different transaction cost assumptions. Finally, tests of economic significance indicate consistent market timing value for the direct forecast method. ...|$|R

40|$|My {{dissertation}} aims at {{understanding the}} impact of uncertainty and disagreement on asset prices. It contains three main chapters. Chapter One gives a general introduction into the topic of partial information and heterogeneous beliefs. Chapter Two explains the link between credit spreads and the heterogeneous formation of expectations in an economy where agents with different perception of economic uncertainty disagree about future cash flows of a defaultable firm. The intertemporal risk-sharing of disagreeing investors gives rise to three testable implications: First, larger belief heterogeneity increases credit spreads and their volatility. Second, it implies a higher frequency of capital structure arbitrage violations. Third, it reduces expected equity returns of low levered firms, but the link can be reversed for high levered firms. We use a data-set of firm-level differences in beliefs, credit spreads, and stock returns to empirically test these predictions. The economic and statistical significance of the intertemporal risk-sharing channel of disagreement is substantial and robust to the inclusion of control variables such as Fama and French, liquidity, and implied volatility factors. Chapter Three studies the link between market-wide uncertainty, difference of opinions and co- movement of stock returns. We show that this link {{plays an important role}} in explaining the dynamics of equilibrium volatility and correlation risk premia, the differential cross-sectional pricing of index and individual options, and the risk-return profile of several option trading strategies. We use firm-specific data on analyst forecasts and test the model predictions. We obtain the following novel results: (a) The difference of index and individual volatility risk premia is linked to a counter-cyclical common disagreement component about future earnings; (b) This common component helps to explain the differential pricing of index and individual volatility smiles in the cross-section, as well as the time-series of correlation risk premia extracted from option prices; (c) The time series of returns on <b>straddle</b> and dispersion <b>option</b> portfolios reflects a significant time-varying risk premium, which compensates investors for bearing common disagreement risk; (d) Common disagreement is priced in the cross-section of option strategy returns...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of a {{graduation}} project, conducted at the financial consultancy firm Maritime Transport and Business Solutions, to fulfill the Master of Science program Management of Technology at the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management at Delft University of Technology. This thesis comes forth out the increasing awareness of the port industry on sustainability and the continuous growth of container transport. Dutch ports are more and more constrained by their physical and environmental boundaries. To reduce the environmental and physical constraints of ports, this research aims to examine whether it is possible to stimulate container terminal operators to enhance their environmental performance. Environment is one of the three elements to enhance sustainability. In order to enhance sustainability it is important to increase the environmental performance without compromising the economic and social factors. A port authority has two revenue streams which both can be used to pressure concessionaires and visiting modalities. This thesis focuses on the incorporation of environmental criteria in the concession agreement and thereby the feasibility to exert pressure on the private sector to increase sustainability. This is combined in the following research question, “How can environmental criteria be incorporated in the awarding procedure for port concessions in order to enhance sustainability of container terminal operations?" In order to do so three building blocks are determined that will provide the information. These three building blocks are, - Concession awarding process, - Evaluation methods for port concessions, - Environmental themes. Container terminal concessions are increasingly awarded via a competitive process. This competitive process can consist of private bilateral negotiation or container terminal concessions can be awarded through an open call for tender. In the awarding process environmental criteria are underexposed but already present in the form of existing legislation and permits. The use of environmental awarding criteria is virtually absent in ports with the exception of Maasvlakte 2. For Maasvlakte 2 concessions an environmental management system and modal split criteria have been used as environmental awarding criteria. The developed evaluation method for port tenders does not differ from other investment projects. The Net Present Value technique is used to determine the added value of the container terminal investment for the port authority. The net present value technique is incorporated in the business case which is an analysis of to determine whether an investment for the port authority is worthwhile. The weighed sum is an evaluation model is the most widely applied evaluation model for tenders. The European Commission implicitly refers to use the weighted sum as evaluation model to evaluate the outcome of a tender process. The establishment of weighting is ultimately determined by political decisions. The net present value technique provides insight on the costs or benefits on the incorporation of environmental criteria and is used as input to apply the weighted sum technique. The combination to determine the value of a project with the net present value technique and further develop an evaluation method with the method of the weighted sum provides an evaluation method to combine the best of both worlds. Environmental themes that are important for consideration in the awarding process of container terminals are: - Air quality, - Energy consumption, - Intensification in use of space, - Water quality management, - Noise, - Light - Preservation and development of nature. These themes have come forth out of desk research and the conducted expert interviews. The themes are reviewed by experts in interviews to judge the feasibility of the themes for the construction of awarding criteria. For the port authorities, an expert from the Port of Rotterdam, two experts from the Port of Amsterdam and one expert of Zeeland Seaports are interviewed. To represent the terminal operators one expert of APM Terminals and one expert of Europe Container Terminals (United States Environmental Protection Agency) have been interviewed. Representing the government, three experts of the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management were interviewed. In order maintain coherence with economic and social parts of sustainability for both these aspects of sustainability an indicator is introduced. For the economic part this indicator is profitability and for social part this indicator is employment. The combination of environmental, social and economical themes represents the sustainability framework. The interviewed experts have acknowledged that incorporation of environmental awarding criteria will stimulate environmental innovation and considering the environment is an increasing dominant factor to maintain their license-to-operate. This license-to-operate is under continuous pressure due to the general trend in society to enhance sustainability. In order to cope with the general trend in society the experts have indicated that intensification in use of space is the most important theme to enhance sustainability. Dutch ports and society are constraint by the physical constraints of the country. To be able to expand the ports’ transshipment without physical expansion benefits the port authorities and society in general. Society in general benefits due to the reason that space can therefore be utilized for other purposes, as housing or recreation for instance. Therefore an indicator for this theme is developed which is based on terminal efficiency and is calculated by the annual throughput per square meter. The second stage of this research has reviewed the feasibility to incorporate intensification of space in the awarding process. To be able to provide sensible comment on this topic, two cases were abstracted from real terminals. The straddle carrier terminal and the change needed in a rail mounted gantry crane terminal. On basis of their differences the needed change to increase sustainability in port operation is mapped. The analysis of the reference terminals was divided in a financial review, an environmental analysis and the application of the evaluation methodology. The reference terminals have revealed that in Hong Kong intensification of space is possible on basis of current practices. The reference cases served as input for the financial review. A business case served as financial review. The business case has revealed that intensification of space is financially feasible. The financial analysis has indicated the trade-off between the economic indicator, profitability and the environmental indicator, space. Based on this business case the performance measures and scoring functions for the weighted sum are constructed. Both reference container terminals are subjected to an environmental analysis based on the sustainable framework of environmental, social and economical themes. This analysis has indicated that the rail mounted gantry crane terminal will have similar of better environmental and social performance than the <b>straddle</b> carrier <b>option.</b> However, due to the higher investments needed to realize the rail mounted gantry crane terminal the profitability of this terminal is lower. To assess whether incorporation in use of space will actually enhance the sustainable performance of container terminals an expert meeting has been held. The port experts of MTBS have revealed that the total sustainability can be determined when all of the above mentioned themes are quantified. Therefore, at this stadium no conclusion can be provided whether the sustainability of container terminals is enhanced with the incorporation of space. However the The general conclusion of this research is that it is possible to enhance the environmental performance of the port by integrating environmental criteria the concession agreement. Based on reference cases the financial, technical and environmental feasibility of the environmental criteria can be determined. The input following from the business case can be used as input for the evaluation model. The application of the weighted sum technique will determine the performance measures and scoring functions of the environmental criterion. When incorporating environmental criteria in the awarding procedure it is important to consider that the environmental criteria are measureable and are attributable to the party responsible. The incorporation of environmental criteria will lead to additional costs without generating additional revenues for port authority and terminal operator. However, from the expert interviews follows that incorporation of environmental criteria is necessary to respond to the general trend in society where environment is becoming an increasingly important topic to maintain their license-to-operate. This implies that environmental criteria have great potential to be incorporated in the near future.
