5|$|At the {{latitude}} of Incapillo, the Nazca plate subducting beneath the South America plate abruptly <b>shallows</b> towards the south. This shallowing forms the limit between the volcanically active Central Volcanic Zone and the magmatically inactive Pampean flat slab region farther south. This magmatic inactivity occurs because the flat slab removes the asthenospheric wedge.|$|E
30|$|Extended <b>shallow</b> planar soil slide is the {{mechanism}} releasing {{the most of}} material volume even {{if the number of}} cases measured is lower in relation to embankment <b>shallow</b> planar soil slide or <b>shallow</b> soil slip (13 cases detected for extended <b>shallow</b> planar soil slide against 150 cases for embankment <b>shallow</b> planar soil slide or <b>shallow</b> soil slip). This observation could be {{explained by the fact that}} extended <b>shallow</b> planar soil slides are clearly a much larger phenomenon than the fewer embankment slips defined as embankment <b>shallow</b> planar soil slide or <b>shallow</b> soil slip and involve greater quantities of soil material. Moreover, 16 cases of significant gully erosion were detected and involved lower quantities of soil material. Nevertheless, regarding the damaged areas, embankment <b>shallow</b> planar soil slide or <b>shallow</b> soil slip are clearly responsible for most of the road maintenance needed and also represent a large part of agriculture land losses, especially in terraces subject to failure processes but also due to land down-slope buried by deposits. Extended <b>shallow</b> planar soil slides are also playing an important role in burying agriculture lands.|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} morning, the Spanish {{sent the}} two ships with a shallower draught {{to find a}} safe approach through the <b>shallows.</b> The caravels anchored about one league from the shore. Ten large canoes powered by both sails and oars rowed out to meet the Spanish ships. Over thirty Maya boarded the vessels and mixed freely with the Spaniards. The Maya visitors accepted gifts of beads, and the leader indicated with signs that they would return to take the Spanish ashore the following day.|$|E
5|$|The long-toed {{salamander}} is an ecologically versatile species {{living in a}} variety of habitats, ranging from temperate rainforests, coniferous forests, montane riparian, sagebrush plains, red fir forest, semiarid sagebrush, cheatgrass plains, to alpine meadows along the rocky shores of mountain lakes. Adults can be located in forested understory, hiding under coarse woody debris, rocks, and in small mammal burrows. During the spring breeding season, adults can be found under debris or in the shoreline <b>shallows</b> of rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds. Ephemeral waters are often frequented.|$|E

Atamasco lily, periwinkle, buttercup, Jack-in-the-pulpit, maypops, and jewelweed are sometimes {{found on the}} banks and in the <b>shallows</b> of Lake Phelps. The Scuppernong River provides a habitat for swamp dogwood, evening primrose, blue flag iris and cardinal flowers. The roughleaf dogwood is also found near the river. This particular dogwood is rare in North Carolina and the type along the Scuppernong is rarer still.|$|E

5|$|A further Bill in 1740 sought {{powers to}} improve the river from Barnby Dun to Fishlake Ferry. Despite serious opposition, which {{included}} the merchants and traders of Doncaster as well as Doncaster Corporation, the Bill was passed, giving the company new powers to make the river deeper and create a cut to avoid the <b>shallows</b> at Stainforth and Bramwith. Work on this northern section started almost immediately. The southern section to Tinsley was navigable by 1751, although the wharf and warehouse had not been completed by that date, and the towpath from Rotherham was not completed until 1822.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{an air of}} defeatism {{among the}} leadership, the {{professional}} French troops and New French militia defenders focused preparations for the British attacks on the Beauport Shore. Montcalm and his staff, Major-General François de Gaston, Chevalier de Lévis, Colonel Louis Antoine de Bougainville, and Lieutenant-Colonel de Sennezergue, distributed some 12,000 troops in a nine-kilometre-long collection of fortified redoubts and batteries from the Saint-Charles River to the Montmorency Falls, along the <b>shallows</b> of the river in areas {{that had previously been}} targeted by British attempts to land. Prior to the arrival of the British, a small fleet of supply ships had arrived in Quebec with much needed supplies. Those supplies, along with 500 reinforcements, were likely behind the lengthened siege.|$|E

40|$|<b>Shallow</b> mixing layers are {{commonly}} observed in compound/composite channels, at {{the confluence of}} two rivers, between rivers and harbor entrances, between main channels and groyne fields, etc. The growth of <b>shallow</b> mixing layers determines the lateral exchange of pollutants and sediments and has great practical importance. The development (growth/decay) of a mixing layer is the combined result of the transverse velocity shear and the bottom friction. This thesis {{is devoted to the}} devising of reliable a mathematical model for <b>shallow</b> flows, and improvement of knowledge in the physics of the <b>shallow</b> mixing layers. Based on the BGK Boltzmann equation, a high resolution numerical scheme for horizontal <b>shallow</b> water flows, which is capable of capturing both wave and diffusion, is formulated, verified and evaluated. This model is applied to <b>shallow</b> mixing layers. The applicability of the model to <b>shallow</b> mixing layers is investigated. Linear stability analysis as an initial value problem is applied to <b>shallow</b> mixing layers to investigate the validity of the traditional normal mode analysis for <b>shallow</b> mixing layers.

40|$|Recently, <b>shallow</b> parsing {{has been}} applied to various {{information}} processing systems, such as information retrieval, information extraction, question answering, and automatic document summarization. A <b>shallow</b> parser is suitable for online applications, because it is much more efficient and less demanding than a full parser. In this research, we formulate <b>shallow</b> parsing as a sequential tagging problem and use a supervised machine learning technique, Maximum Entropy (ME), to build a Chinese <b>shallow</b> parser. The major features of the ME-based <b>shallow</b> parser are POSs and the context words in a sentence. We adopt the <b>shallow</b> parsing results of Sinica Treebank as our standard, and select 30, 000 and 10, 000 sentences from Sinica Treebank as the training set and test set respectively.

5|$|Many humans enjoy {{venturing into}} the sea: {{children}} paddle and splash in the <b>shallows,</b> while others swim or relax on the beach. This {{was not always}} the case, with sea bathing becoming the vogue in Europe in the 18th century after Dr. William Buchan advocated the practice for health reasons. Surfing is a sport in which a wave is ridden by a surfer, {{with or without a}} surfboard. Other water sports include kite surfing, where a power kite propels a manned board across the water; windsurfing, where the power is provided by a fixed, maneuverable sail; and water skiing, where a powerboat is used to pull a skier.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the steering {{from the bridge}} was disabled. Blücher had just passed Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak <b>shallows)</b> and was in a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. Normally the rudder is controlled electrically from the bridge to the motors forward of the Handsteuerraum (hand steering room) deep under the armored deck, forward of the rudder. In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual steering, but orders from the bridge to the rudder may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. The speed of the torpedo was known and set, but {{the speed of the}} target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E
5|$|Also notable are the spiracles {{on the top}} of the head, which {{suggest the}} {{creature}} had primitive lungs as well as gills. This attribute would have been useful in shallow water, where higher water temperature would lower oxygen content. This development may have led to the evolution of a more robust ribcage, a key evolutionary trait of land-living creatures. The more robust ribcage of Tiktaalik would have helped support the animal’s body any time it ventured outside a fully aquatic habitat. Tiktaalik also lacked a characteristic that most fishes havebony plates in the gill area that restrict lateral head movement. This makes Tiktaalik the earliest known fish to have a neck, with the pectoral girdle separate from the skull. This would give the creature more freedom in hunting prey either on land or in the <b>shallows.</b>|$|E
40|$|As <b>shallow</b> reefs {{continue}} to decline, scientists {{are searching for}} the key to their persistence; as it turns out, they may just need {{to look a little}} deeper. Healthy and stable mesophotic coral reef communities are being discovered around the world and inspired the Deep Reef Refugia Hypothesis (DRRH), which suggests that mesophotic reefs are acting as a refuge for depauperate <b>shallow</b> communities by bolstering populations and enhancing sexual reproduction. However, several assumptions of this hypothesis remain untested: (1) vertical and horizontal spatial isolation has not led to reproductively isolated of <b>shallow</b> and deep conspecifics, and (2) larvae generated from deep corals are attracted to and survive in <b>shallow</b> coral reef habitats. This project was conducted on the barrier reef of Belize where the reefs grow along the vertical wall and <b>shallow</b> and mesophotic coral populations are separated by limited horizontal distance. Although 8 microsatellite markers demonstrated no population structure between <b>shallow</b> and mesophotic O. franksi, fine scale morphometric analysis using 25 landmarks revealed clear differences between mesophotic and <b>shallow</b> colonies. Gametes from Orbicella franksi inhabiting the <b>shallow</b> (14 - 20 m) and the upper mesophotic (27 - 32 m) were crossed and found to be compatible. Larvae produced in reciprocal crosses between deep and <b>shallow</b> parents developed normally and were equally viable as larvae obtained from intradepth crosses. While larvae from <b>shallow</b> parents did not exhibit any settlement preference between tiles conditioned at <b>shallow</b> depths versus in the mesophotic zone, there was significantly more mesophotic larvae that preferred to settle on <b>shallow</b> conditioned tiles. Yet, no difference was seen in the post-settlement survival between depths. These results suggest a close coupling between <b>shallow</b> and mesophotic reefs through gamete and larval export that likely play an increasingly vital role in <b>shallow</b> reef persistence and recovery...|$|R

5|$|Dominic Fontana, a {{geographer}} at the University of Portsmouth, has voiced {{support for}} du Bellay's {{version of the}} sinking based on the battle as it is depicted in the Cowdray Engraving, and modern GIS analysis of the modern scene of the battle. By plotting the fleets and calculating the conjectured final manoeuvres of the Mary Rose, Fontana reached {{the conclusion that the}} ship had been hit low in the hull by the galleys and was destabilised after taking in water. He has interpreted the final heading of the ship straight due north as a failed attempt to reach the <b>shallows</b> at Spitbank only a few hundred metres away. This theory has been given partial support by Alexzandra Hildred, one of the experts who has worked with the Mary Rose, though she has suggested that the close proximity to Spitbank could also indicate that the sinking occurred while trying to make a hard turn to avoid running aground.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} fifteen days the fleet {{followed}} the coastline west, and then south. The expedition was now perilously short of fresh water, and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull {{close to the}} shore due to the <b>shallows.</b> On 23 February 1517, the Spanish spotted the Maya city of Campeche. A large contingent put ashore to fill their water casks. They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being loaded into the boats; they questioned the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs. The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city. Once inside the city, the Maya leaders {{made it clear that}} the Spanish would be killed if they did not withdraw immediately. The Spanish party retreated in defensive formation to the safety of the ships.|$|E
5|$|Saumarez {{ordered his}} squadron's boats to assist Hannibal and Pompée, {{both of which}} were trapped under heavy fire and unable to {{effectively}} respond. As he did so, Linois ordered his ships to cut their anchor cables and drift into the <b>shallows,</b> away from the becalmed British squadron. Formidable successfully completed the manoeuvre, but both Desaix and Indomptable grounded inshore, where they were exposed to heavy fire from Saumarez's ships, which had also cut their cables in an effort to close with their opponents. At 13:35 however, Saumarez recognised that his squadron was in danger of grounding directly under the fire of the Spanish batteries. With the squadron's boats either sunk or employed towing Pompée back to Gibraltar, there was no possibility of launching an amphibious operation against the Spanish forts and Saumarez reluctantly called the attack off, the remainder of the squadron retiring to Gibratar but leaving the stranded Hannibal in the Bay of Gibraltar.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{proposes a}} {{theoretical}} {{analysis of the}} performance of deep/shallow recessed hybrid bearing. It is intended that, {{on the basis of the}} numerical results drawn from this study, appropriate <b>shallow</b> recess depth and width can be determined for use in the bearing design process. By adopting bulk flow theory, the turbulent Reynolds equation and energy equation are modified and solved numerically including concentrated inertia effects at the recess edge with different depth and width of <b>shallow</b> recess. The results indicate that the load capacity, drag torque increases as the depth of <b>shallow</b> recess is <b>shallower</b> and the width ratio (half angle of deep recess versus half angle of <b>shallow</b> recess) is smaller. In contrast, the flow rate decreases as the depth of <b>shallow</b> recess is <b>shallower</b> and the width ratio is smaller. Nevertheless, the appropriate design of the depth and width of <b>shallow</b> recess might well induce the performance of high-speed deep/shallow recessed hybrid bearing...|$|R
