40|$|Recognizing goods {{produced}} in different <b>sub-regions</b> within a country as distinct differentiated products, we offer new evidence of variety expansion in nation’s export. We decompose Japanese national exports into prefecture <b>sub-regions</b> and construct extensive margins and intensive margins of exports for <b>sub-regions</b> {{for the period}} between 1988 and 2005. In this study we examine exports of over 41 <b>sub-regions</b> of Japan in over 7, 000 product categories. First, we examine {{to what extent the}} empirical findings of the extensive margin in Hummels and Klenow (2005) for cross-country samples applies to <b>sub-regions</b> within a country. We find that extensive margin accounts for over 60 percent of the greater exports of larger <b>sub-regions.</b> Second, we examine heterogeneous growth of exports variety among <b>sub-regions</b> for the sample periods. We find export variety of most prefectures expands in our sample periods, but decreasing in variety can also be found for prefectures positioned in either high variety or lowest variety group in 1988. We conclude that export expansion in terms of new exports from <b>sub-regions</b> within a country can account significant portion of product variety and export production is being dispersed among regions rather than going through the process of agglomeration. ...|$|R

30|$|Combining the hypocenters {{relocated}} in all <b>sub-regions,</b> we {{have created}} a catalog of relocated earthquakes in the study region. Note that there are overlapping areas between <b>sub-regions</b> A 5 and B 3, A 6 and B 4, and A 7 and C 1 (see Fig. 2). Consequently, in some cases, earthquakes were relocated in both <b>sub-regions.</b> In such cases, we selected and plotted earthquakes relocated in the eastern <b>sub-regions</b> (i.e., B 3, B 4, and C 1); duplicated earthquakes relocated in the western <b>sub-regions</b> {{were not included in}} the catalog. This approach was adopted because more earthquakes were relocated in the eastern <b>sub-regions</b> than in the western <b>sub-regions.</b> Although the hypocenters in the overlap areas between adjacent <b>sub-regions</b> may differ for a given earthquake, this difference is relatively small: for the 75 earthquakes in the overlap areas, the average and standard deviation of the differences (between the eastern and western <b>sub-regions)</b> in latitude, longitude, and focal depth for each earthquake are − 0.006 °± 0.064 °, 0.022 °± 0.053 °, and 2.40 ± 7.06 km, respectively. Furthermore, there is no directional bias in the differences. For comparison, the average and standard errors (in latitude, longitude, and focal depth) for the 75 relocated earthquakes in the eastern <b>sub-regions</b> are 0.033 °± 0.016 °, 0.027 °± 0.013 °, and 4.8 ± 2.8 km, respectively. Therefore, the average differences between the two locations are less than the standard errors of hypocenter locations. Consequently, we conclude that no systematic bias has been introduced in the new catalog. In the following sections, we outline the main features of the seismicity.|$|R
30|$|A {{modelling}} {{framework for}} changing Arctic sea ice extent is developed reflecting different trends and seasonal extremes in nine Arctic <b>sub-regions.</b> Core <b>sub-regions</b> retain partial ice cover throughout the year, and in winter show complete ice cover, while in peripheral <b>sub-regions,</b> winter coverage is not complete, {{and there is}} no ice cover at all in the summer. A generalized beta representation is developed for monthly ice extents in core <b>sub-regions,</b> with inflation to model maximum winter extents. For peripheral <b>sub-regions,</b> a gamma time series with excess zeroes (representing summer sea ice absence) is developed. Different trend representations (deterministic vs. stochastic) are compared for non-extreme observations. Other potential applications of the generalized beta density allowing zero or maximum inflation are discussed.|$|R

5|$|Tradition and old records {{assert that}} {{southern}} Somalia, including the Mogadishu area, was inhabited very early by hunter-gatherers of Khoisan descent. Although {{most of these}} early inhabitants {{are believed to have}} been either overwhelmed, driven away or, in some cases, assimilated by later migrants to the area, physical traces of their occupation survive in certain ethnic minority groups inhabiting modern-day Jubaland {{and other parts of the}} south. The latter descendants include relict populations such as the Eile, Aweer, the Wa-Ribi, and especially the Wa-Boni. By the time of the arrival of peoples from the Cushitic Rahanweyn (Digil and Mirifle) clan confederacy, who would go on to establish a local aristocracy, other Cushitic groups affiliated with the Oromo (Wardai) and Ajuuraan (Ma'adanle) had already formed settlements of their own in the <b>sub-region.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate resting-state functional connectivity (FC) differences in insular <b>sub-regions</b> during the interictal phase in patients with migraine without aura (MWoA). Methods: Forty-nine MWoA patients (MWoA group) and 48 healthy individuals (healthy control group) were recruited for this study. All of the subjects underwent neurological examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI data were processed using Brat 1. 0 software to obtain a whole-brain FC diagram and using Rest 1. 8 software to obtain the FC z-score of the <b>sub-regions</b> of both insulas (six <b>sub-regions</b> on each side). Therefore, there were a total of 12 regions of interest (ROIs) that were used as seed points for the statistical analysis. Results: There was abnormal FC between the insular <b>sub-regions</b> and multiple brain regions in the MWoA patients compared with the healthy control group, and a clear laterality was also observed. In addition, the FC z-score of certain <b>sub-regions</b> was negatively correlated with the disease duration. Conclusion: Different insular <b>sub-regions</b> are functionally associated with different regions of the brain and therefore have different functions. In MWoA, the FC between the insular <b>sub-regions</b> and other brain regions was mostly reduced, while a small amount was increased; additionally, the FC may be ipsilateral with a right-side advantage. Variations in the FC of insular <b>sub-regions</b> can be observed as an important indicator of MWoA...|$|R
