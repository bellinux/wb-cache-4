5|$|By March 1905, Potter {{was anxious}} to begin work on the tale. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> 1903 version too thin and rewrote the entire story, {{retaining}} Ribby the cat and Duchess the dog as the central characters while elaborating the setting and developing a stronger plot line. It was decided the tale would be published in a format slightly larger than her previous productions with ten full-colour illustrations and other illustrations in pen and sepia ink.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 Wilkinson {{was invited}} by the India League {{to join a}} small delegation, to report on {{conditions}} in India. During the three-month visit she met Gandhi, then in prison, and became convinced that his co-operation was essential to any prospect of peace in the subcontinent. On her return home she delivered her conclusions in an uncompromising report, The Condition of India, published in 1934. She visited Germany shortly after Hitler {{came to power in}} 1933, and published a pamphlet, The Terror in Germany, that documented early incidents of Nazi outrage. She collaborated with a refugee from Hitler's Germany, Edward Conze, to produce a major book, Why Fascism?, which condemned the Labour Party's gradualism and focus upon parliament as well as the failure of communist strategy, arguing for the need for grassroots workers' unity and revolution to check the threat of fascism across Europe. Meanwhile, her parliamentary prospects had been revived by her selection as Labour candidate for Jarrow, a Tyneside shipbuilding town. Jarrow had been devastated early in the 1930s by the run-down and closure of Palmers shipyard, the town's main source of employment. Early in 1934 Wilkinson led a deputation of Jarrow's unemployed to meet the prime minister, MacDonald, in his nearby Seaham constituency, and received sympathy but no positive action. She was unimpressed by the government's Special Areas Act, passed late in 1934 and designed to assist distressed areas such as Jarrow; <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> legislation provided inadequate funding, and benefited employers more than workers.|$|E

25|$|Wuornos told several {{inconsistent}} {{stories about}} the killings. She claimed initially that all seven men had raped her while she {{was working as a}} prostitute but later recanted the claim of self-defense, citing robbery and a desire to leave no witnesses as the reason for murder. During an interview with filmmaker Nick Broomfield, when <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> cameras were off, she told him that it was, in fact, self-defense, but she could not stand being on death row—where she had been for ten years at that point—and wanted to die.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to Fitzroy Crossing, Oscar worked in state government community welfare and health departments, before becoming the Junjuwa Community Women’s Resource Officer in 1989. She then became the Chairperson of the Marra Worra Worra Aboriginal Corporation, one of Australia’s {{oldest and most}} respected Aboriginal community centres, until 1991, when she was appointed Commissioner of the Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Commission for a 2-year term. When she was 29 years old, Oscar {{received a phone call}} from Aboriginal Affairs Minister Robert Tickner asking her to join the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. She hung up the phone because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> call was a hoax but then decided to call him back.|$|E

60|$|She {{sat in the}} car, vaguely {{thinking}} {{over the}} events of the past few days, whilst watching the throng of rowdy merrymakers seething around her. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>the</b> noble-hearted, proud woman whom she had helped to bring from her beautiful English home to sorrow and humiliation in a dank French prison, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>the</b> gallant English gentleman with his pleasant voice and courtly, debonnair manners.|$|R

25|$|From {{their arrival}} in 1922, the Crosbys led {{the life of}} rich expatriates. They were {{attracted}} to the bohemian lifestyle of the artists gathering in Montparnasse. They settled in an apartment at 12, Quai d'Orléans on Île St-Louis, and Polly donned her red bathing suit and rowed Harry down the river to the Place de la Concorde, where he walked the last few blocks to the bank. Harry wore his dark business suit, formal hat, and carried his umbrella and briefcase. Caresse rowed home alone, and in her swim suit her generously endowed chest drew whistles, jeers, and waves from workmen. She later wrote that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> exercise was good for her breasts, and she enjoyed the attention.|$|E
25|$|LAPD detectives {{investigating}} the case quickly concluded that Rasmussen {{had been killed}} by a burglar. Rasmussen's attire (a bathrobe, nightgown, and panties) suggested she was not expecting visitors. Although a maid in a neighboring unit reported hearing screaming and fighting earlier in the day, she did not recall gunshots. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> whole event had been a domestic dispute and did not call police. It appeared that the perpetrator had been in the process of taking electronic equipment when Rasmussen had come upon him or them and, as a result, jewelry had been left behind and the vehicle taken as a getaway. The abandoned BMW was recovered a week later; it yielded no new evidence. The only other thing that appeared to have been taken from the home was the couple's marriage license.|$|E

500|$|Meera Syal was {{attracted}} to her role because Miranda was not a clichéd private detective and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> humour was [...] "fresh". During the second filming block, Mark Gatiss briefly joined the cast, playing the small but important role of Robert Louis Stevenson in flashback scenes in episode five.|$|E
500|$|... "No More Mr. Nice Guy" [...] was {{watched by}} {{approximately}} 14 million viewers, {{making it the}} night's second most watched program, behind Dancing with the Stars. The episode gained mixed reviews from critics. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times stated that the episode was [...] "the worst House episode ever", while Gina Dinunno of TV Guide commented that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> episode was [...] "pretty good".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{positive}} reviews and its popularity among music blogs, [...] "Love Ballad" [...] failed to chart anywhere. In {{an interview with}} Gulf Times, Lo said <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> song's poor commercial reception was due to her change of stage name. She stated, [...] " [...] didn't sell particularly well. I'd used my real name, Tove Nilsson, when I was in Tremblebee so perhaps no-one knew who I was".|$|E

60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>the</b> little turkeys {{wandering}} in the grass, {{of the children}} sleeping at last, of the quiet, wonderful stars. Then <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>the</b> cows left unmilked, and listened to them stirring uneasily in the yard. She rose, at last, and stole forth. She could not rid herself of <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> that they would suffer. She knew what the dull ache in the full breasts of a mother was, {{and she could not}} let them stand at the bars all night moaning for relief.|$|R

500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle {{found the}} writing not funny, writing {{that he could}} not see [...] "Jon Heder's expressionless face" [...] as he talked in the {{animation}}. The Staten Island Advance said the change to animation freed Napoleon from real-world limitations, but thought it [...] "lessen the overall appeal of the character and setting". Lori Rackl of the Chicago Sun-Times did not like the movie and liked the animated series even less; <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> emotions and physical humor were lost in the change to animation.|$|E
500|$|Geri Halliwell {{described}} the single as a [...] "big love song" [...] and [...] "a Spice Girl classic". Chisholm, in her 2008 appearance on Never Mind The Buzzcocks, commented that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> song {{was not good}} at all, and that {{at least she was}} against the release of any new material when the record company was trying to market the Greatest Hits release. She would later say [...] "Headlines grew on me, it really came in to its own when we toured it, and it really felt lovely on stage".|$|E
500|$|Mary Stuart {{thought the}} final {{conflict}} with Tom Riddle in the Chamber {{was almost as}} scary as in some of Stephen King's works, and perhaps too strong for young or timid children. She commented that [...] "there are enough surprises and imaginative details thrown in as would normally fill five lesser books." [...] Like other reviewers, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> book would give pleasure to both children and adult readers. According to Philip Nel, the early reviews gave unalloyed praise while the later ones included some criticisms, although they still agreed that the book was outstanding.|$|E

6000|$|And at {{the same}} instant, came the ironical question: 'What for?' <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>the</b> colliers' wives, with their {{linoleum}} and their lace curtains and their little girls in high-laced boots. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>the</b> wives and daughters of the pit-managers, their tennis-parties, and their terrible struggles to be superior each to the other, in the social scale. There was Shortlands with its meaningless distinction, the meaningless crowd of the Criches. There was London, the House of Commons, the extant social world. My God! ...|$|R

500|$|Jay Black from AOL TV {{disliked the}} episode's awkward moments and thought Michael's {{unhappiness}} with Jan {{came out of}} nowhere. Black did however praise Pam's prank as well as Dwight himself, but concluded his review: [...] "A surprisingly weak handling of character combined with fewer laugh-out-loud moments than I'm used to forces me to give this episode 4 Creed number-twos out of 7." [...] Entertainment Weekly staff writer Abby West also critiqued [...] "Women's Appreciation", explaining that it [...] "felt exactly like a 30-minute episode stretched to fill 43 minutes." [...] <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> episode [...] "only came together" [...] once the Office women performed an intervention for Michael.|$|E
500|$|After leaving Versailles, neither Jourdain nor Moberly {{mentioned}} the incident {{to one another}} until a week later. Moberly wrote a letter about the trip to her sister {{and when she got}} to the afternoon of the Versailles incident, she asked Jourdain if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Petit Trianon was haunted. Jourdain told her that she thought it was. Three months later in Oxford, [...] they compared their notes, then decided to write separate accounts of what happened and research the history of the Trianon. In doing so, they found that on 10 August 1792, the Tuileries palace in Paris was besieged, the king's Swiss guards were massacred and the monarchy itself was abolished six weeks later.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with other}} Final Destination characters, Clear was {{conceived}} by series creator Jeffrey Reddick. Ali Larter, who {{starred in the}} 1999 film Varsity Blues, was cast as Clear Rivers. Larter stated that she was thrilled to [...] "be playing a more introverted, darker character than [...] was accustomed to at the time". <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> script was special and turned down all other scripts where {{she would have been}} cast in roles such as a cheerleader or a victim. Larter liked the themes of both films and thought they were fascinating within their genre. According to her, the film shows {{how easy it is to}} turn on someone and to blame someone when you're scared and about trusting your intuitions and yourself.|$|E
