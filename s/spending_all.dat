5|$|On March 7, 1988, {{three weeks}} after Hairspray was {{released}} nationwide, Divine was staying at the Regency Plaza Suites Hotel in Los Angeles. He was scheduled to film a guest appearance the following day as Uncle Otto on the Fox network's television series Married... with Children in the second season wrap-up episode. After <b>spending</b> <b>all</b> day at Sunset Gower Studios for rehearsals, Divine returned to his hotel that evening, where he dined with friends at the hotel restaurant before returning to his room. Shortly before midnight, he died in his sleep, at age 42, of an enlarged heart. His body was discovered by Bernard Jay the following morning, who then sat with the body {{for the next six}} hours, alongside three of Divine's other friends. They contacted Thomas Noguchi, the Chief Coroner for the County of Los Angeles, who arranged for removal of the body; Divine's friends were able to prevent the press from taking any photographs of the body as it was being carried out of the hotel.|$|E

5|$|The {{season is}} the worst in Benfica history {{since the start of}} the Primeira Liga during 1934–35. The club {{switched}} managers two times. Jupp Heynckes was replaced by José Mourinho in September. Toni, who previously guided the club to a league title, took the reins in December. In the transfer market, young players like Marchena and Fernando Meira were brought in, and mixed with the experience of 31 year-old, Pierre van Hooijdonk, who arrived to replace Nuno Gomes, were meant to improve the team competitiveness. However, the biggest event of the pre-season was the release of João Pinto, the longest-serving player on the club, and the incumbent captain. This decision was poorly received by the fans, who criticized Heynckes and the president for the move. Both would leave the club in the following months. In the league campaign, the team lacked balance year-round and only briefly entered the league race, <b>spending</b> <b>all</b> but three weeks out the top three. Even the successful partnership of Pierre van Hooijdonk and João Tomás, with 36 goals between them, did not prevent the club from finishing in sixth place, 23 points behind winner Boavista. Consequently, Benfica missed out on UEFA competitions for the first time in 51 years (since the 1959–60 season).|$|E

25|$|Free agency saw the {{departure}} of two 2006 starters for the Patriots: tight end Daniel Graham signed with the Denver Broncos, and linebacker Tully Banta-Cain signed with the San Francisco 49ers, while running back Corey Dillon, the Patriots' leading rusher in 2006, asked to be released; the Patriots released him on March 2. Safety Tebucky Jones was also released early in the offseason. Another departure came when punter Todd Sauerbrun signed with the Denver Broncos. When Sauerbrun was signed by the Patriots in December 2006, he agreed to a right of first refusal, meaning that the Patriots could match any offer by any other team made in the subsequent offseason. When the unrestricted free agent signing period came, the Broncos tendered Sauerbrun, and the Patriots exercised their right and matched the offer. However, the Broncos argued that the Patriots had not filed the proper documents required for that right, and ordered a hearing before an NFL special master. The Broncos won this hearing and Sauerbrun was allowed to sign with the Broncos. After <b>spending</b> <b>all</b> of training camp with the team, veteran punter Josh Miller was released on August 16.|$|E
25|$|After the Schism, around {{half of all}} the mutants on Utopia {{accompany}} Wolverine to Westchester {{to be a part of}} the new school. He appoints {{himself as}} the headmaster, Kitty Pryde as the co-headmistress, Hank McCoy as the vice-principal, and various other characters such as Rogue, Cannonball, Iceman, Rachel Grey, and Gambit are appointed as the school's staff. Toad is appointed as a janitor. The first issue focuses on the state education board visiting to approve of their school application. As Logan and Kitty give the delegation a tour, Kade Kilgore shows up and tells Logan that he is the one who caused the Schism and he will destroy all that Logan has worked to build up. Wolverine founded the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, <b>spending</b> <b>all</b> the fortune that he had amassed over the years upon it. On its first day it was assaulted by the new Hellfire Club, who had been a major force in causing the Schism of the X-Men. Wolverine made it clear that he didn't want to lose any of the kids and fought as hard as he could against the Frankenstein Monsters whom Iceman defeated by making Ice clones of himself. Then, they were attacked by the Hellfire Club, who were in possession of a spawn of the original Krakoa.|$|E
25|$|Sonya {{becomes the}} {{convenor}} {{of the local}} Gambler's Anonymous support group and meets Patricia Pappas, her neighbour Chris's (James Mason) mother. She learns that Patricia does not know that Chris's boyfriend Hudson Walsh (Remy Hii) is serving time in prison for murder, and inadvertently reveals Chris's secret to her. Soon after Patricia is arrested for theft to fund her gambling, leading to Chris discovering her secret. Chris is angry with Sonya, calling her a hypocrite. However, Chris {{come to terms with}} his mother's problem, and turns to Sonya for advice. Sonya spends less time at home with Toadie, Callum and Nell, causing strain on her marriage. Toadie hires Naomi Canning as his personal assistant and her mother, Sheila (Colette Mann), warns Sonya to be wary of her daughter. Sonya reluctantly allows Callum to go to the United States after he wins an overseas scholarship. The problems in the Rebecchi marriage continue when Sonya starts <b>spending</b> <b>all</b> of her time helping Mark Brennan and Bailey Turner (Calen Mackenzie) through their issues. Sonya and Toadie have a big argument in public, and Sonya goes away with Nell. On her return, she learns Naomi kissed Toadie and Sonya slaps her during a confrontation. She later apologises to Naomi. Sonya and Toadie agree to cut back on their work, so that they can spend more time together, and eventually convinces Naomi to return to working for Jarrod as he loses customers. Sonya supports Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) when he falls ill with depression, allowing him to visit the nursery to be at one with nature. When Paul recovers, he uses the nursery, and Sonya, as a marketing campaign to try to get himself re-elected as mayor; however, the nursery is trashed by Jayden Warley (Khan Oxenham) in revenge as his mother Sue Parker (Kate Gorman) is the stand-in mayor. Paul convinces Sonya not to press charges against Jayden and Sonya realises that Paul did this to blackmail Sue into standing down as mayor.|$|E

500|$|Tug McGraw pitched for the Mets from 1965 to 1967, {{and again}} from 1969 to 1974 after <b>spending</b> <b>all</b> of the 1968 {{season in the}} minor leagues. In those nine seasons, he amassed 86 saves and {{appeared}} in 361 games. He appeared in the postseason for the 1969 Miracle Mets, pitching three innings against the Atlanta Braves. He was selected to the 1972 All-Star team, and appeared in the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award voting in 1972 and 1973. During the 1973 pennant-winning season, he coined the Mets' rally cry, [...] "Ya gotta believe!" [...] In the 1974 season, McGraw experienced issues with his arm and shoulder. Thus, the Mets traded McGraw, along with outfielders Don Hahn and Dave Schneck, to the Phillies in December 1974 for pitcher Mac Scarce, catcher John Stearns, and outfielder Del Unser.|$|E
500|$|Filming lasted 138 days, {{during which}} Fincher shot more than 1,500 rolls of film, {{three times the}} average for a Hollywood film. The {{locations}} were in and around Los Angeles, including most notably: The Promenade Towers, Melrose Avenue, St. Brendan's Catholic Church, and Michael Heizer's public art sculpture [...] Sets were also built in Century City. Production designer Alex McDowell constructed more than 70 sets. The exterior of Tyler Durden's house was built in Wilmington, California, while the interior was built on a sound stage at the studio's location. The interior was given a decayed look to illustrate the deconstructed world of the characters. Marla Singer's apartment was based on photographs of apartments in downtown LA. Overall production included 300 scenes, 200 locations, and complex special effects. Fincher compared Fight Club to his subsequent, less complex film Panic Room: [...] "I felt like I was <b>spending</b> <b>all</b> my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on." ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{continued}} to play large halls in the US, organised by tour promoter Frank Barsalona, and generally avoided festivals, but made an important exception with the Woodstock Festival on 16 August. After <b>spending</b> <b>all</b> night arguing with Barsalona, the band agreed to perform at Woodstock for $12,500. The festival ran late and the Who did not take to the stage until the early morning of 17 August. During [...] "Pinball Wizard", Abbie Hoffman took to the stage to protest about the imprisonment of John Sinclair before being kicked offstage by Townshend, while during [...] "See Me, Feel Me", the sun rose, almost as if on cue. Two weeks later, the group played the second Isle of Wight Festival, {{using one of the}} largest live PAs available. Though media attention was on Bob Dylan playing his first major live concert since 1966, the Who stole the show.

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling it an [...] "inconsistent mixed bag episode," [...] with many jokes [...] " [...] flat." [...] In a {{simultaneous}} review {{of the episode}}s of The Simpsons and American Dad! that preceded and followed the episode respectively, as well as The Cleveland Show, The A.V. Club's Todd VanDerWerff commented that he thought the episode [...] "started out well before sort of just petering out as the episode went on," [...] comparing it to South Parks attempt to replace Kenny McCormick, before ultimately reintroducing the character into the series. In the conclusion of his review, VanDerWerff praised Quagmire's monologue, commenting [...] "it's certainly amusing that the show is <b>spending</b> <b>all</b> of this time tearing down the one character who's a mouthpiece for the creator." [...] Ahsan Haque of IGN criticized the episode for its [...] "execution," [...] stating, [...] "Auditioning friends to replace Cleveland seemed like a better idea on paper." [...] Haque praised Quagmire's tirade against Brian, however, as [...] "completely unexpected" [...] and [...] "mildly amusing," [...] but ultimately gave the episode a 6.4 out of 10. In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Ramsey Isler of IGN listed [...] "Jerome Is the New Black" [...] as [...] "remarkably unfunny, with lazy and unoriginal writing." ...|$|E
500|$|While most child {{characters}} {{on the show}} are foul-mouthed, Kenny is often even more risqué with his dialogue. Parker and Stone state that they depict Kenny and his friends in this manner in order to display how young boys really talk when they are alone. While Kenny is often cynical and profane, Parker notes that there nonetheless is an [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] aspect to the character, and Time magazine described Kenny and his friends as [...] "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence". He is amused by toilet humor and bodily functions, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes. Kenny is shown to desire intercourse in the episode [...] "The Ring", when Kenny gets a girlfriend and is overjoyed {{to find out that}} she has a reputation as a slut. Kenny is also lecherous, and often portrayed as being eager to do and say disgusting things in an attempt to impress others or earn money. Conversely, his alter-ego Mysterion is seemingly mature, principled, and serious-minded, the only exception being one instance in [...] "Mysterion Rises" [...] in which he takes delight in irritating Cartman. As Mysterion he convinces his parents to take better care of themselves and their children, as seen by their reaction when he questions them about the cult of Cthulhu. He also uses his disguise to protect his sister Karen (who refers to Mysterion as her [...] "guardian angel"), as revealed in [...] "The Poor Kid." [...] In all of his guises, however, Kenny is depicted as being uncommonly selfless, dying for the sake of others and <b>spending</b> <b>all</b> of his time working so he could buy his little sister a doll.|$|E
