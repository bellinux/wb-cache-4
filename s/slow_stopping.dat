50|$|The Holme {{station master}} told the enquiry that he then sent for the platelayers; whilst {{waiting for them}} he checked the up line home signal and saw it to be at 'danger'. However, when a down express went through he noticed {{that one of the}} signals did not go to 'danger' after it had passed. This {{appeared}} considerably at variance with other testimony.The platelayers had to be sent for because they had been allowed to go {{home at the end of}} their normal working day, despite the weather. Their foreman was uneasy about this and came out of his house to watch the up distant signal whilst two trains went past: the first of these was the Manchester express, running about 13 minutes behind the Scotsman; the second a <b>slow</b> <b>stopping</b> passenger train, a further 6 minutes behind when it left Peterborough. As he feared, the signal showed a white light throughout. He put his work clothes back on and went to the signal. The arm was weighed down with snow; once he had shaken this off by working the arm up and down it showed a red light. He then walked to the station; on his way he met a platelayer despatched to the distant signal by the stationmaster.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aims of each treatment planning system is the ability of delivering a target conformal dose distribution. Developed and successful used within the heavy ion therapy pilot project, the TReatment plannIng for Particles (TRiP) [1] is characterised by the capability of delivering exact results in relatively short time, making it possible to rapidly verify and, if necessary, recalculate the therapy plans.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{relation}} between self-reported impulsivity, inhibitory control, and the neural correlates of stopping performance within the normal population. METHODS: Healthy individuals scoring high and low on trait impulsivity performed an auditory stop-signal task. Stopping performance and neural correlates of stopping (i. e. N 1 and stop P 3) were compared between the impulsive {{groups as well as}} between participants who were slow and fast in stopping. RESULTS: As expected, N 1 and stop P 3 were larger for successful relative to failed stops (i. e. N 1 and stop P 3 effects). Participants scoring high relative to low on impulsivity showed equal stopping performance, had larger stop P 3, but similar N 1 effects. Slow as compared to fast stoppers had reduced stop P 3, but similar N 1 effects. CONCLUSIONS: Participants scoring high relative to low on impulsivity may need more effortful inhibitory control to yield equal stopping performance. Slow relative to fast stoppers may have weaker inhibition processes and abnormal error processing. In contrast to ADHD, both high impulsives as well as slow stoppers had an intact N 1 effect. SIGNIFICANCE: Subjective impulsivity and <b>slow</b> <b>stopping</b> in healthy individuals cannot be generalized to ADHD...|$|E
40|$|The {{described}} experiments {{which were}} {{performed at the}} CERN synchrocyclotron with different target-projectile combinations at different beam energies allow a systematic of the pion production in nucleus-nucleus collisions below the threshold. Thereby the pion production shows clearly the existence of collective effects in the nucleus-nucleus collision in the energy range of 60 - 84 MeV/u: 1.) The measured cross sections exceed those predicted in the simple nucleon-nucleon collision with Fermi motion {{by more than one}} order of magnitude. 2.) The mean velocity determined from the longitudinal rapidity cannot be explained by single nucleon collisions. 3.) The model of the collective pionic bremsstrahlung describes well both the excitation function, the energy spectra, and the angular distribution. Thereby result <b>slow</b> <b>stopping</b> ranges which indicates, that the pions in the collision are produced only during a short time. For the asymmetric systems in the rapidity distribution for low pion energies a structure in the data is seen which can be interpreted as two source velocity components which can be caused by superposition of two processes. For photons with energies above 50 MeV in the nucleus-nucleus collision a cross section was found which is comparable with that of pions with the same whole energy. The high-energy photons can be described by electromagnetic bremsstrahlung in the slowing down of the charge in the nuclear field...|$|E
