50|$|Stepfathers {{have been}} shown to abuse female step{{children}} more than males. They are also shown to be more abusive towards female children than biological families, but less abusive than adoptive fathers. The abuse studied with men in mind tends to focus on physical or sexual abuse of children rather than emotional abuse. Neglect is also discussed as a qualifying method of child abuse by step parents in general. In 2004 a U.S. study by Weekes and Weekes-Shackelford found that while biological fathers fatally abuse children 5 and under at a rate of 5.6 per million per year; step fathers were found to have a rate of 55.9 per million per year. A U.K. study done in 2000 had different results which found that many less children responded as being abused by a <b>step</b> <b>parent.</b> Economic factors could also {{play a role in the}} abuse of step children. In places with higher levels of social strain abuse may be more prevalent or more violent. Other studies of census data and child neglect and abuse records have found that step parents may be over represented in abuse figures. They found that when the data is balanced, the biological parents have a much higher rate of abuse than the step parents do.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether the intergenerational transmission of human capital, measured by intergenerational earnings mobility, {{is affected by}} divorce. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I find that, with each additional year in a family involving a single or a <b>step</b> <b>parent,</b> the earnings mobility between biological fathers and children rises and the mobility between mothers and daughters falls. However, using either sibling fixed effects or instrumental variable estimation, I find that the association between family structure and father-child mobility is explained by selection. These findings have two important implications. First, they imply {{that the increase in}} father-son mobility observed in other studies {{can be explained by the}} rise in single and <b>step</b> <b>parent</b> families over the same period. Second, these findings imply that the connection between fathers and children would have been weak whether or not a divorce occurred, which does not support the hypothesis that father absence is an important factor contributing to differences in child outcomes across family structures. intergenerational earnings mobility, family structure...|$|E

40|$|Child {{obesity in}} the U. S. is a {{significant}} public health issue, particularly among children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Thus, the roles of parents’ human and financial capital and racial and ethnic background have become important topics of social science and public health research on child obesity. Less often discussed, however, {{is the role of}} family structure, which is an important predictor of child well-being and indicator of family socioeconomic status. The goal of this study, therefore, is to investigate how preschool aged children’s risk of obesity varies across a diverse set of family structures and whether these differences in obesity are moderated by family poverty status and the mothers’ education. Using a large nationally representative sample of children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study – Birth Cohort, we find that preschoolers raised by two biological cohabiting parents or a relative caregiver (generally the grandparent) have greater odds of being obese than children raised by married biological parents. Also, poor children in married biological parent households and non-poor children in married <b>step</b> <b>parent</b> households have greater obesity risks, while poor children in father only, unmarried step, and married <b>step</b> <b>parent</b> families actually have lower odds of obesity than children in non-poor intact households.

40|$|Modern {{marriage}} markets display increasing turnover, {{with less}} marriage but more divorce and remarriage. As a consequence, {{a large number}} of children live in single parent and <b>step</b> <b>parent</b> households. There is substantial evidence that children of divorced parents do not perform as well as comparable children in intact families. However, there is also some evidence that this gap declines with the aggregate divorce rate. We develop a model in which the higher expectations for remarriage associated with higher divorce rates can trigger an equilibrium in which divorced fathers make more generous transfers that benefit their children and the mother in the aftermath of divorce. As a result, the welfare loss of children from the separation of their parents can be lower when divorce and remarriage rates rise. ...|$|E

40|$|To {{test the}} {{existence}} of the "magic moment" for parental marriage immediately post-birth and to inform policies that preferentially encourage biological over <b>step</b> <b>parent</b> marriage, this study estimates the incidence and stability of maternal marriage for children born out of wedlock. Data came from the National Survey of Family Growth on 5, 255 children born non maritally.

Stepfather marriages occurred much later in a child's life-one-half occurred after the child turned age 7 -and had one-third higher odds of dissolution. Children born to black mothers had qualitatively different maternal marriage experiences than children born to white or Hispanic mothers, with less biological-parent marriage and higher incidences of divorce. Findings support {{the existence of}} the magic moment and demonstrate that biological marriages were more enduring than stepfather marriages. Yet relatively few children born out of wedlock experienced stable, biological-parent marriages as envisioned by marriage promotion programs...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether the}} repeatedly demonstrated increase in risk {{of child abuse}} and infanticide associated with living with a <b>step</b> <b>parent</b> generalized to cases of unintentional childhood fatal injury, {{the most common cause of}} death in children across the developed world.

Even when using the most conservative possible analytic approach, in which all cases in which family type was unclear were classified as being from an ‘intact biological family’, step children under 5 years of age were found to be at significantly increased risk of unintentional fatal injury of any type, and of drowning in particular. Children from single-parented families were generally not found to be at significantly increased risk of intentional or unintentional fatal injury, while children who lived with neither of their biological parents were at greatest risk overall for fatal injury of any type. <br /...|$|E
40|$|We examine {{resource}} allocation in step-households in the United States and South Africa {{to test whether}} child investments vary according to economic and genetic bonds between parent and child. In the United States, households spend less on food {{when a child is}} raised by a non-biological mother. The reduction is identical for step, adoptive, and foster households, consistent with the hypothesis that genetic ties are the ones that binds. In South Africa, where food spending can be disaggregated, households spend less on milk, fruit and vegetables, and more on tobacco and alcohol, {{in the absence of a}} child's birth mother. Family living arrangements have changed dramatically in the United States in a generation. Children in the middle of the century were, on the whole, born to married parents, with whom they lived until adulthood. In the United States today, over half of all children will live apart from at least one parent before reaching age 18 (Bumpass and Sweet, 1989), and a majority of these children will live with a <b>step</b> <b>parent</b> or foster parent. Until recently, most academics were not very concerned about changes in children's family structures. During the 1970 s, single parenthood was viewed as a time of transition (Ross and Sawhill, 1975) between divorce and remarriage, and step families were considered to be good substitutes for original two-parent families. Since the 1980 s, however, several developments have chal-lenged this optimistic view. First, declines in remarriage have lead to extended periods of high poverty for single mothers and their children, undermining the notion that single parenthood is a time of transition. Second, a growing body of research has shown that children raised by only one of their parents are less successful than children raised by both their parents, when measured across a broad array of outcomes. Although some of these disadvantages are due to characteristics of the parents that predate divorce, there is mounting evidence that parent-absence itself plays at least some causal role in reducing children's life chances. (McLanahan and Sande-fur, 1994; Haveman and Wolfe, 1994). A primary mechanism behind the negative association between parent absence and low achievement appears to be poverty and economic insecurity, which accompany family disruption and have long term negative consequences for children (Duncan and Brooks...|$|E
