[...] The liquid filled cavity is {{commonly referred to}} as the hydrostatic body. [...] The liquid within the hydrostatic body acts as an incompressible fluid and the body wall of the hydrostatic body provides a passive elastic antagonist to muscle contraction, which in turn generates a force, which in turn creates movement. This structure plays a role in invertebrate <b>support</b> <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> is used for the tube feet in starfish and body of worms [...] [...] A specialized version of the hydrostatic skeleton is a called a muscular hydrostat, which consists of a tightly packed array of three-dimensional muscle fibers surrounding a hydrostatic body.

40|$|International audienceIn tetrapods, feeding {{behaviour}} in general, and prey capture in particular, involves two anatomical systems: the feeding <b>system</b> <b>and</b> the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system.</b> Although the kinematics {{associated with the}} movements of each system have been investigated in detail independently, the actual integration between the two systems has received less attention. Recently, {{the independence of the}} movements of the jaw <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> <b>systems</b> was reported during tongue-based prey capture in an iguanian lizard (Anolis carolinensis), suggesting a decoupling between the two systems. Jaw prehension, on the other hand, can be expected to be dependent on the movements of the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> to a greater degree. To test for the presence of functional coupling and integration between the jaw <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> <b>systems,</b> we used the cordyliform lizard Gerrhosaurus major as a model species because it uses both tongue and jaw prehension. Based on a 3 -D kinematic analysis of the movements of the jaws, the head, the neck and the forelimbs during the approach and capture of prey, we demonstrate significant correlations between the movements of the trophic <b>and</b> the <b>locomotor</b> <b>systems.</b> However, this integration differs between prehension modes in the degree {{and the nature of the}} coupling. In contrast to our expectations and previous data for A. carolinensis, our data indicate a coupling between feeding <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> <b>systems</b> during tongue prehension. We suggest that the functional integration between the two systems while using the tongue may be a consequence of the relatively slow nature of tongue prehension in this species...|$|R

40|$|Fish develop {{morphological}} specializations {{in their}} trophic <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> <b>systems</b> {{as a result}} of varying functional demands in response to environmental pressures at different life stages. These specializations should maximize particular performances in specialists, adapting them to their trophic and habitat niches at each ontogenetic stage. Because differential growth rates of the structural components comprised in the head are likely to be linked to the diet of a fish throughout its development, we investigated the ontogenetic development of two haplochromine cichlid species belonging to different trophic guilds. We employed geometric morphometric techniques to evaluate whether starting from morphologically similar fry they diverge into phenotypes that characterize trophic guilds <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> types. Our examination of overall body shape shows that certain specialized morphological features are already present in fry, whereas other traits diverge through ontogeny due to differences in species-specific allometric variation. Allometric shape variation was found to be more relevant for the biter specialist than for the sucker morphotype. Our results confirm that phenotypic changes during ontogeny can be linked to dietary and habitat shifts in these fish.

40|$|Ivermectin is a {{veterinary}} pharmaceutical generally used {{to control}} the ecto- and endoparasites of livestock, but its use has resulted in adverse effects on coprophilous insects, causing population decline and biodiversity loss. There is currently no information regarding the direct effects of ivermectin on dung beetle physiology and behaviour. Here, based on electroantennography and spontaneous muscle force tests, we show sub-lethal disorders caused by ivermectin in sensory <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> <b>systems</b> of Scarabaeus cicatricosus, a key dung beetle species in Mediterranean ecosystems. Our findings show that ivermectin decreases the olfactory <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> capacity of dung beetles, preventing them from performing basic biological activities.

Occupational medical assessment and advice can be required by patients with acute symptoms, at routine check-ups, by persons who have problems doing certain jobs, and for expert medical reports as to the fitness of persons with chronic disorders or after operations. Therefore, for occupational medical purposes a physical examination must aim primarily to investigate functions and not structures or radiologic evidence. The physical examination should be structured systematically and according to regions of the body and, together with a specific (pain) anamnesis should {{provide a basis for}} the medical assessment. This paper presents a function-oriented system for physical examination of the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system,</b> named fokus (C) (F unktions o rientierte K oerperliche U ntersuchungs s ystematik, also available on DVD). fokus (C) has been developed with a view to its relevance for occupational medical practice and does not aim primarily to provide a precise diagnosis. Decisive for an occupational medical assessment of disorders of the musculoskeletal system is rather information about functional disorders and any impairment of performance or mobility which they can cause. The division of the physical examination into a rapid screening phase and a subsequent more intensive functional diagnostic phase has proved its practicability in many years of day-to-day use. Here, in contrast to the very extensive measures recommended for orthopaedic and manual diagnosis, for reasons of efficiency and usability of the system in routine occupational medical examinations the examination is structured according to the findings. So it is reduced to that which is most necessary and feasible. </p...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the hypothalamus, basal ganglia or pedunculopontine nucleus in decorticate animals results in locomotion and a cardiorespiratory response resembling that seen during exercise. This {{has led to the}} hypothesis that parallel activation of cardiorespiratory <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> <b>systems</b> from the midbrain could form part of the ‘central command’ mechanism of exercise. However, the degree to which subcortical structures play a role in cardiovascular activation in awake humans has not been established. We studied the effects on heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) of electrically stimulating the thalamus and basal ganglia in awake humans undergoing neurosurgery for movement disorders (n = 13 Parkinson's disease, n = 1 myoclonic dystonia, n = 1 spasmodic torticollis). HR and MAP increased during high frequency (> 90 Hz) electrical {{stimulation of}} the thalamus (HR 5 ± 3 beats min− 1, P = 0. 002, MAP 4 ± 3 mmHg, P = 0. 05, n = 9), subthalamic nucleus (HR 5 ± 3 beats min− 1, P = 0. 002, MAP 5 ± 3 mmHg, P = 0. 006, n = 8) or substantia nigra (HR 6 ± 3 beats min− 1, P = 0. 001, MAP 5 ± 2 mmHg, P = 0. 005, n = 8). This was accompanied by the facilitation of movement, but without the movement itself. Stimulation of the internal globus pallidus did not increase cardiovascular variables but did facilitate movement. Low frequency (< 20 Hz) stimulation of any site did not affect cardiovascular variables or movement. Electrical {{stimulation of the}} midbrain in awake humans can cause a modest increase in cardiovascular variables that is not dependent on movement feedback from exercising muscles. The relationship between this type of response and that occurring during actual exercise is unclear, but it indicates that subcortical command could be involved in ‘parallel activation’ of the <b>locomotor</b> <b>and</b> cardiovascular <b>systems</b> and thus contribute to the neurocircuitry of ‘central command’...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to identify factors associated with satisfaction among inpatients receiving medical and surgical care for cardiovascular, respiratory, urinary <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> diseases. Two weeks after discharge, 533 patients completed a Patient Judgments Hospital Quality questionnaire covering seven dimensions of satisfaction (admission, nursing and daily care, medical care, information, hospital environment and ancillary staff, overall quality of care and services, recommendations/intentions). Patient satisfaction and complaints were treated as dependent variables in multivariate ordinal polychotomous and dichotomous logistic stepwise regressions, respectively. Patient sociodemographic, health and stay characteristics as well as organization/activity of service were used as independent variables. The two strongest predictors of satisfaction for all dimensions were older age and better self-perceived health status at admission. Men tended to be more satisfied than women. Other predictors specific for certain dimensions of satisfaction were: married, Karnofsky index more than 70, critical/serious self-reported condition at admission, emergency admission, choice of hospital by her/himself, stay in a medical service, stay in a private room, length of stay less than one week, stay in a service with a mean length of stay longer than one week.

40|$|The urotensin II (UII) {{gene family}} {{consists}} of four paralogous genes called UII, UII-related peptide (URP), URP 1 and URP 2. UII and URP peptides exhibit the same cyclic hexapeptide core sequence (CFWKYC) while the N- and C-terminal regions are variable. UII, URP 1 and URP 2 mRNAs are differentially expressed within {{the central nervous system}} of teleost fishes, suggesting that they may exert distinct functions. Although the cardiovascular, ventilatory <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> effects of UII have been described in teleosts, much less is known regarding the physiological actions of URPs. The goal {{of the present study was}} to compare the central and peripheral actions of picomolar doses (5 - 500 pmol) of trout UII, URP 1 and URP 2 on cardio-ventilatory variables <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> activity in the unanesthetized trout. Compared to vehicle, intracerebroventricular injection of UII, URP 1 and URP 2 evoked a gradual increase in total ventilation (VTOT) reaching statistical significance for doses of 50 and 500 pmol of UII and URP 1 but for only 500 pmol of URP 2. In addition, UII, URP 1 and URP 2 provoked an elevation of dorsal aortic blood pressure (PDA) accompanied with tachycardia. All peptides caused an increase in locomotor activity (ACT), at a threshold dose of 5 pmol for UII and URP 1, and 50 pmol for URP 2. After intra-arterial (IA) injection, and in contrast to their central effects, only the highest dose of UII and URP 1 significantly elevated VTOT and ACT. UII produced a dose-dependent hypertensive effect with concomitant bradycardia while URP 1 increased PDA and heart rate after injection of only the highest dose of peptide. URP 2 did not evoke any cardio-ventilatory or locomotor effect after IA injection. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that endogenous UII, URP 1 and URP 2 in the trout brain may act as neurotransmitters and/or neuromodulators acting synergistically or differentially to control the cardio-respiratory <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> <b>systems.</b> In the periphery, the only physiologica...|$|R

It has been proved that the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> affects occurrence of this disease in many aspects therefore, apart from the primary care of gastroenterologists and general practitioners, treatment using physiotherapeutic techniques becomes significant. Sphincter mechanism {{at the lower end of}} the oesophagus being the most important anti-reflux barrier in terms of function is described in the theoretical part in detail. Possible ways and factors involved in occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux and then current treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease are mentioned. The other part of the theoretical part is aimed at: relations between the internal organs <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> <b>system,</b> the diaphragm function and its relation to occurrence of GERD, and possibilities of rehabilitation treatment of patients with this disease. The goal of the theoretical part was to provide a research on the current situation. The practical part was prepared by means of a qualitative research. The tested set consisted of three patients diagnosed with GERD being treated at the Gastroenterological Ward in České Budějovice Hospital. Patients? anamneses were taken and kinesiological testing was done. Similarly, all three patients were identified with a disorder of trunk stabilization. Upon this, individual therapies were proposed and carried out, which was the goal of the practical part, too. Physiotherapy was aimed at: affecting the position of the rib cage and improving its dynamics while breathing, training of breathing stereotype, activation of the abdominal wall, affecting the stabilizing function of legs, exercises in developmental series and modified positions, Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation, and affecting reflexive changes using soft techniques. The research issue was whether the symptoms of GERD could be affected by treatment of functional disorders of the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> in a positive way. There were certain changes in the kinesiological testing (e. g. change in the activity of lower and upper fixators of scapulae with relaxation of the trapezius, releasing the rigidity of the chest, affecting the dynamic stability of the body) during a three-month therapy. However, functional disorders were not affected that much so any described symptoms of GERD could be changed. The results of the therapy were limited by motivation, attitude and patients? metal state. Not only the internal organ but also the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> probably plays a role in occurrence of the reflux; but also psyche, and all these parts of a human being affect each other. Therefore the treatment of a multifactorial disease such as GERD should be comprehensive. Apart from physiotherapy, metal area, too, and all factors should be treated at the same time, which requires interdisciplinary cooperation unfortunately lagging behind...|$|R

Based on the average velocity, they {{were divided into two}} groups of eight, trained group (TG) and untrained group (UT). The electrocardiogram and the electromyogram of the vastus lateralis muscle of the right thigh were digitized at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz, and processed off-line. Each cardiac and electromyographic cycle was detected to further investigate the coupling between cardiac and running rates in time domain, using the cross-correlation, and in the frequency domain, using a phase synchronization measure based on the Hilbert transform. A Shannon entropy index and magnitude squared coherence were also applied to improve analysis. Results Both groups presented low cross-correlation (0. 18 &# 177; 0. 07 TG and 0. 15 &# 177; 0. 08 UG) values between these signals, and only four from 16 subjects presented short epochs of phase synchronization (4. 1 &# 177; 8. 6 % TG and 3. 2 &# 177; 7. 3 % UG) between signals, occurring at a low frequency band and random phase differences. The low to moderate coherence (0. 67 &# 177; 0. 16 TG and 0. 64 &# 177; 0. 16 UG) observed at 0. 1 Hz appears to be an effect of the simultaneous action of sympathetic system over both cardiac and muscular rhythms.

Fifty-one patients fulﬁlling the New York criteria of AS and 43 healthy age- and gender-matched volunteers were included in the study. Physical <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> examinations were performed and history data were obtained for all patients. Disease activity parameters were assessed together with anthropometric parameters. Routine laboratory examinations and genetic testing (HLA-B 27) were performed. Serum calprotectin levels and fecal calprotectin levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mean age of the patients was 41. 5 years, the mean duration of the disease was 8. 6 years, and the delay in diagnosis was 4. 2 years. Serum calprotectin levels were similar in both AS patients and in the control group (p= 0. 233). Serum calprotectin level was correlated with Bath AS disease activity index (BASDAI) and Bath AS functional index (BASFI) (p= 0. 001, p= 0. 002, respectively). A higher level of fecal calprotectin was detected in AS patients when compared with the control group.

The animals represented the active population in Pomerania and Kujavia, first calved in 2000 and 2001, and were culled before the end of 2008. Frequency of calvings, which averaged 1. 5 % for twin births and just 0. 02 % for triplet births, increased with age of cow and also with increasing milk yield in the preceding lactation. Performance results showed that mothers of twins were superior to mothers of single calves in terms of milk yield (1. 3 kg milk/day milking). Despite the greater perinatal mortality of twins and triplets, multiple pregnancies gave rise to a greater number of calves compared to single pregnancies. However, multiple pregnancies were accompanied by adverse effects such as increased proportion of complications requiring human assistance, mechanical assistance and veterinary intervention (1. 2 × more). Fertility of the cows deteriorated after multiple pregnancies, with particularly unfavourable indicators of fertility found for triplet births, decreased chance of survival to the next calving, and increased culling rates in cows, especially due to udder diseases, infertility, reproductive diseases, old age, metabolic and gastrointestinal diseases, <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> diseases.

Limited research has been undertaken which quantifies the impact of obesity on {{the function of the}} paediatric foot and lower limb. Furthermore, it is yet undetermined whether overweight children display similar functional changes as their obese counterparts. The primary aim of this research was to advance understanding on foot function and lower limb biomechanical movement characteristics in children; analysing differences between obese, overweight and normal weight children. Having determined the reliability of the measurement protocols, 100 children were recruited for assessment of body mass status and plantar foot loading. Following this, a sub-group of 45 children were recruited and three-dimensional gait analysis was undertaken. Plantar foot loading and lower limb temporal-spatial, kinematic and kinetic gait characteristics were analysed during barefoot level walking. Multiple regression was undertaken to determine relationships between body mass status, foot loading and lower limb gait biomechanics. Findings demonstrated that overweight and obese children displayed marked differences in foot loading and lower limb gait biomechanics when compared to normal weight children. The research identified that increased loading at the midfoot and 2 nd- 5 th metatarsals significantly predicted change in the kinematic and kinetic walking parameters at the hip and ankle in overweight and obese children. These findings provide evidence of an atypical biomechanical function of the foot and lower limb. This work advances understanding on the implications of excessive body mass on the functional characteristics of the paediatric foot and lower limb. This research identifies for the first time, differences in foot loading and lower limb gait biomechanics in overweight and obese children relative to those of normal weight.

Our study aimed to look for specific stressor differences among demographic and clinical variables in a naturalistic setting of patients with AD. Methods: A restrospective statistical analysis of the data of patients diagnosed with AD from November 2009 to September 2012, identified via manual search from the archive of the outpatient setting at the University Unit of Psychiatry “A. Fiorini” Hospital, Terracina (Latina, Italy), was performed. Results: The sample consisted of 93 patients (46 males and 47 females), aged between 26 and 85, with medium–high educational level who were mainly employed. In most cases (54. 80 %), a diagnosis of AD with mixed anxiety and depressed mood was made. In all, 72 % of the sample reported a negative family history for psychiatric disorders. In 22. 60 %, a previous history of psychopathology, especially mood disorders (76. 19 %), was reported. The main stressors linked to the development of AD were represented by working problems (32. 30 %), family problems (23. 70 %), and/or somatic disease (22. 60 %) with significant differences with respect to age and sex. Half of the patients were subjected to a single first examination; 24. 47 % requested a copy of medical records. Conclusion: Confirming previous data from previous reports, our results suggest that AD may have a distinct profile in demographic and clinical terms. Increased scientific attention is hoped, particularly focused on addressing a better definition of diagnostic criteria, whose correctness and accuracy are critical, especially in situations with medicolegal implications.

40|$|SummaryChemotaxis is a {{powerful}} paradigm to investigate how nervous systems represent and integrate changes in sensory signals to direct navigational decisions. In the Drosophila melanogaster larva, chemotaxis mainly consists of an alternation of distinct behavioral modes: runs and directed turns. During locomotion, turns are triggered by the integration of temporal changes in {{the intensity of the}} stimulus. Upon completion of a turning maneuver, the direction of motion is typically realigned toward the odor gradient. While the anatomy of the peripheral olfactory circuits <b>and</b> the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> of the larva are reasonably well documented, the neural circuits connecting the sensory neurons to the motor neurons remain unknown. We combined a loss-of-function behavioral screen with optogenetics-based clonal gain-of-function manipulations to identify neurons that are necessary and sufficient for the initiation of reorientation maneuvers in odor gradients. Our results indicate that a small subset of neurons residing in the subesophageal zone controls the rate of transition from runs to turns—a premotor function compatible with previous observations made in other invertebrates. After having shown that this function pertains to the processing of inputs from different sensory modalities (olfaction, vision, thermosensation), we conclude that the subesophageal zone operates as a general premotor center that regulates the selection of different behavioral programs based on the integration of sensory stimuli. The present analysis paves the way for a systematic investigation of the neural computations underlying action selection in a miniature brain amenable to genetic manipulations...|$|R
40|$|Thousands of {{scientists}} strive to identify cellular mechanisms {{that could lead}} to breakthroughs in developing ameliorative treatments for debilitating neural and muscular conditions such as spinal cord injury (SCI). Most studies use rodent models to test hypotheses, and these are all limited by the methods available to evaluate animal motor function. This study’s goal was to develop a behavioral <b>and</b> <b>locomotor</b> assessment <b>system</b> in a murine model of SCI that enables quantitative kinematic measurements to be made automatically in the open-field by applying markerless motion tracking approaches. Three-dimensional movements of eight naı̈ve, five mild, five moderate, and four severe SCI mice were recorded using 10 cameras (100 Hz). Background subtraction was used in each video frame to identify the animal’s silhouette, and the 3 D shape at each time was reconstructed using shape-from-silhouette. The reconstructed volume was divided into front and back halves using k-means clustering. The animal’s front Center of Volume (CoV) height and whole-body CoV speed were calculated and used to automatically classify animal behaviors including directed locomotion, exploratory locomotion, meandering, standing, and rearing. More detailed analyses of CoV height, speed, and lateral deviation during directed locomotion revealed behavioral differences and functional impairments in animals with mild, moderate, and severe SCI when compared with naı̈ve animals. Naı̈ve animals displayed the widest variety of behaviors including rearing and crossing the center of the open-field, the fastest speeds, and tallest rear CoV heights. SCI reduced the range of behaviors, and decreased speed (r =. 7...|$|R

Method: Sixteen adult New Zealand white rabbits aged 6 to 7 months, weighing between 2 and 2. 5 kg <b>and</b> without <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> abnormalities were studied. In all the animals, a defect {{was made in the}} femoral condyles of the right and left knees, measuring 3. 2 mm in diameter and 4 mm in depth, using a trephine. The animals were divided into two groups: study group formed by the right knees, in which the medial and lateral condyles received implants of SCBG; and control group formed by the left knees, in which the medial and lateral condyles were allowed to heal naturally. The knees were assessed 90, 120 and 180 days after the operation. After the animals had been sacrificed, the anatomical specimens were resected and placed in Bouin's solution. They were then photographed with a Nikon Coolpix 5400 ® coupled to a Nikon SM 2800 ® stereoscopic loupe, to analyze the surface, coloring, consistency, continuity and healing. Results: The results were evaluated using the chi-square test. There {{were no significant differences in}} the macroscopic assessments of healing between the study and control groups.

40|$|As fish {{move and}} {{interact}} with their aquatic environment by swimming, small morphological variations of the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> can have profound implications on fitness. Damselfishes (Pomacentridae) have inhabited coral reef ecosystems for more than 50 million years. As such, habitat preferences and behavior could significantly constrain the morphology and evolvability of the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system.</b> To test this hypothesis, we used phylogenetic comparative methods on morphometric, ecological and behavioral data. While body elongation represented {{the primary source of}} variation in the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> of damselfishes, results also showed a diverse suite of morphological combinations between extreme morphologies. Results show clear associations between behavior, habitat preferences, and morphology, suggesting ecological constraints on shape diversification of the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system.</b> In addition, results indicate that the three modules of the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> are weakly correlated, resulting in versatile and independent characters. These results suggest that Pomacentridae is shape may result from the interaction between (1) integrated parts of morphological variation that main- tain overall swimming ability and (2) relatively independent parts of the morphology that facilitate adaptation and diversification.

40|$|A natural {{synchronization}} between <b>locomotor</b> <b>and</b> respiratory <b>systems</b> {{is known}} to exist for various species and various forms of locomotion. This Locomotor-Respiratory Coupling (LRC) is fundamental for the energy transfer between the two subsystems during long duration exercise and originates from mechanical and neurological interactions. Different methodologies {{have been used to}} compute LRC, giving rise to various and often diverging results in terms of synchronization, (de-) stabilization via information, and associated energy cost. In this article, the theory of nonlinear-coupled oscillators was adopted to characterize LRC, through the model of the sine circle map, and tested {{it in the context of}} cycling. Our specific focus was the sound-induced stabilization of LRC and its associated change in energy consumption. In our experimental study, participants were instructed during a cycling exercise to synchronize either their respiration or their pedaling rate with an external auditory stimulus whose rhythm corresponded to their individual preferential breathing or cycling frequencies. Results showed a significant reduction in energy expenditure with auditory stimulation, accompanied by a stabilization of LRC. The sound-induced effect was asymmetrical, with a better stabilizing influence of the metronome on the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> than on the respiratory system. A modification of the respiratory frequency was indeed observed when participants cycled in synchrony with the tone, leading to a transition toward more stable frequency ratios as predicted by the sine circle map.

Understanding the {{adaptation}} and diversification of complex phenotypes {{is a central}} task of evolutionary biology. However, because many phenotypes are complex, constructed in a in a hierarchy of biological organization that often must perform multiple functions, studies frequently lack the detail required to fully understand the evolution of these systems. To gain a deeper understanding regarding the evolution of complex phenotypes, I integrate evolutionary modeling and functional morphology approaches to investigate locomotor evolution in lizards of the Southwest United States. I use evolutionary models based on habitat use, predator escape behavior, and foraging mode to examine what drives diversity in sprint speed, acceleration, and exertion in these lizards. I then examine how the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> is designed for specific locomotor tasks. Because muscle provides the force required for locomotion, I focus on muscle cross-sectional area (CSA). I first {{examine the relationship between}} each performance and muscle CSA, and then explore how these relationships and CSA distribution vary with function (flexors vs. extensors) and anatomical location (hip, knee, and ankle). Finally, because the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> is composed of numerous traits that can vary in their functional roles, I explore what drives the evolution of each trait individually. I model the evolution of each trait, and compare the best fitting modelsacross traits to determine how the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> evolves as a whole. Overall, I demonstrate that multiple selective pressures act on both <b>locomotor</b> performance <b>and</b> morphology from the cellular to whole animal level. However, selection is not uniform within the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system.</b> Performance related selection acts across many locomotor traits, but some are more constrained or not subject to selection. Behavioral variation is an important driver of phenotypic diversity as behavioral shifts guide the evolution of performance, muscular design, and form-function relationships in these lizards. Finally, the complexity of the <b>locomotor</b> <b>system</b> may promote adaptation and diversification through the mitigation of potential functional trade-offs <b>and</b> allowing alternative <b>locomotor</b> designs to yield similar performance capabilities...|$|R
