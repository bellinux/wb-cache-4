25|$|An {{adjustable}} wood bit, {{also known}} as an expansive wood bit, has a small center pilot bit with an adjustable, sliding cutting edge mounted above it, usually containing a single sharp point at the outside, with a <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> to lock the cutter in position. When the cutting edge is centered on the bit, the hole drilled will be small, and when the cutting edge is slid outwards, a larger hole is drilled. This allows a single drill bit to drill {{a wide variety of}} holes, and can take the place of a large, heavy set of different size bits, as well as providing uncommon bit sizes. A ruler or vernier scale is usually provided to allow precise adjustment of the bit size.|$|E
2500|$|The first Stevens 520 {{appeared}} in Stevens' 1909 Catalog #52 {{and was also}} offered {{for sale in the}} Fall 1909 Sears & Roebuck catalog. It is easily recognizable by its [...] "Humpback" [...] double hump receiver. [...] It had a round slide release knob {{on the left side of}} the receiver, a visible breech locking bolt on the top of the receiver, and base models had a rounded pistol grip on the butt stock. The fore grip was ringed and uniform in size. The trigger housing was retained with three screws and the safety was a lever located inside the trigger guard in front of the trigger. The cartridge stop was a rocker design with a <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> on front right side of the receiver. There were other models including a Model 522 trap gun and the 525, 530, and 535 with increasing levels of engraving and stock quality (some straight grip) and fore grips. Internally there was an inertial slide release block that was affixed to the inside of the receiver. [...] This inertial release used the recoil of a discharged round to unlock the breech. [...] The action was designed to only unlock after firing or with use of the slide release and not by dry firing like many modern shotguns. [...] All model 520s were only offered in 12 gauge until 1928.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Set</b> <b>screws</b> are {{not always}} {{the best way to}} resist the torque of driven shafts. To reduce the chance of {{slipping}} and to increase load capacity, a detent (often called a [...] "flat") may be milled or ground at the part of the shaft where the <b>set</b> <b>screw's</b> point contacts. The detent, however, must be closely aligned with the threaded hole prior to fastening. The operator can often feel the screw push the flat into final alignment as he or she makes the last half- or quarter-turn that tightens the <b>screw.</b> <b>Set</b> <b>screws</b> can successfully hold against heavy-torque applications if the details are right. For example, endmill holders of the solid type typically use large <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> holding against flats to fasten the endmill, and heavy loads are resisted. However, small <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> without flats are prone to spinning and galling if overloaded. The use of keys and keyways instead of, or in combination with, <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> is common for applications requiring high torque resistance or transmission. Splines offer yet more strength.|$|R

2500|$|Thread {{grinding}} {{is done on}} {{a grinding}} machine using specially dressed grinding wheels matching {{the shape of the}} threads. The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is ball screw mechanisms. There are three types: center-type grinding with axial feed, center-type infeed thread grinding and centerless thread grinding. Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a single-point cutting tool, except the cutting tool is replaced with a grinding wheel. Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required. Center-type infeed thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is fed into the blank to the full thread depth. Then the blank is slowly rotated through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per revolution. Finally, the centerless thread grinding process is used to make head-less set screws in a similar method as centerless grinding. The blanks are hopper-fed to the grinding wheels, where the thread is fully formed. Common centerless thread grinding production rates are 60 to 70 pieces per minute for a [...] long <b>set</b> <b>screw.</b>|$|E

It is common to machine small flats onto the shaft at the <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> locations to eliminate this problem.|$|E

50|$|A <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> {{is a type}} of screw {{generally}} used {{to secure}} an object within or against another object, normally not using a nut (see bolts compared with screws). The most common examples are securing a pulley or gear to a shaft. Set screws are usually headless (also called blind), meaning that the screw is fully threaded and has no head projecting past the major diameter of the screw thread. If a <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> has a head, the thread will extend {{all the way to the}} head (whereas a bolt might have an unthreaded shank between the head and thread). A blind <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> (known in the UK as a grub screw, quite possibly from its figurative resemblance to a soil-dwelling grub) is almost always driven with an internal-wrenching drive, such as a hex socket (Allen), star (Torx), square socket (Robertson), or slot. The <b>set</b> <b>screw</b> passes through a threaded hole in the outer object and is tightened against the inner object to prevent it from moving relative to the outer object. It exerts compressional or clamping force through the bottom tip that projects through the hole.|$|E

5000|$|Headless <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> {{have been}} around for a long time, with the {{straight}} slot being the oldest drive type (due to its ease of machining), but the demand for headless <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> experienced a marked increase in the first and second decades of the 20th century, when a penchant for better industrial safety, a campaign with the slogan [...] "safety first", swept the industrialized nations of North America and Europe as a part of the larger Progressive Movement. This surge in safety consciousness was a backlash against the often-atrocious industrial safety standards of the era. H.T. Hallowell, Sr., a U.S. industrialist whose corporation was one of several that pioneered the commercialization of the hex socket drive, noted in his memoir that line shafting, which was [...] in the industrial practice of the time, often had headed <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> (with external-wrenching square drive) holding the many pulleys to the line shafts, and collars holding the shafts from axial movement. Gear trains of exposed gears were also common at the time, and those, too, often used headed <b>set</b> <b>screws,</b> holding the gears to the shafts. His company's chief products at the time were shaft hangers and shaft collars of pressed-steel construction. The [...] "safety craze" [...] created a burgeoning demand for headless <b>set</b> <b>screws</b> on pulleys, gears, and collars to replace the headed ones, so that workers' clothing and fingers were less likely to catch on the exposed rotating screw head. It was this heightened demand that prompted Hallowell's firm to get into the screw-making business and to explore socket-head drive designs. With P.L. Robertson holding fresh patent rights on a practical-to-make square-socket drive, the firm soon pursued the hex socket drive.|$|R
