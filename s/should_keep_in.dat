5|$|Many {{attempts}} were made to reconstruct the exact mass of the Roman pound. One method for doing this consists in weighing old coins; another uses the fact that Roman weight units were derived from Roman units of length similarly to the way the kilogramme was originally derived from the metre, i.e. by weighing a known volume of water. Nowadays the Roman pound is often given as 327.45g, but one <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind that (apart from the other uncertainties that come with such a reconstruction) the Roman weight standard is unlikely to have remained constant to such a precision over the centuries, and that the provinces often had somewhat inexact copies of the standard. The weight and subdivision of the pound in the Holy Roman Empire was reformed by Charlemagne, but in the Byzantine Empire it remained essentially the same. Since Byzantine coins circulated up to Scandinavia, the old Roman standard continued to be influential through the Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|In {{the field}} of medico-criminal {{forensic}} entomology, L. mexicana {{can be used to}} determine post mortem intervals using a time of colonization on corpses because the fly is attracted to freshly killed animal carcasses.

25|$|It is {{important}} to note that the footnotes contain numerous errors and even contradictions vis-à-vis the article text, as can be seen in the text of articles 2.311 and 2.312 and the footnote to the former. Some of these errors are attributable to the codifier, but others are likely due to circumstances beyond his control. There are instances where Vélez Sársfield reworked an entire title or modified a rule without altering the footnotes pertaining to the original edition. In this manner, for example, all the footnotes in Book IV were brought directly from the original drafts by Victorino de la Plaza without any of the pertinent modifications. That said, one <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind that during the editing of Nueva York and La Pampa many modifications from the original text were accumulated.|$|E
25|$|The {{change in}} timing rushed {{preparations}} for the operations, which were hasty and imperfect as a result. The original instructions for the second Transjordan operations contained only a general statement that considerable help might be counted on from the Beni Sakhr and that Chauvel <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> close touch with them. GHQ had no clear idea of {{the capabilities of the}} Beni Sakhr, but GHQ fitted them into Chauvel's battle and Allenby ordered Chauvel to attack on 30 April. All this happened without asking the opinion of either T. E. Lawrence or Captain Hubert Young, Lawrence's liaison officer with the Beni Sakhr, who was aware that the leader of the Arabs around Madaba was both perplexed and frightened by GHQ's reaction to his envoys. Lawrence was in Jerusalem during the Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt operations and claimed no knowledge of the Beni Sakhr, or their leader.|$|E

(One <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind that in Grassmann's day, the only axiomatic theory was Euclidean geometry, and the general notion of an abstract algebra {{had yet to be}} defined.) In 1878, William Kingdon Clifford joined this exterior algebra to William Rowan Hamilton's quaternions by replacing Grassmann's rule epep = 0 by the rule epep = 1. (For quaternions, we have the rule i2 = j2 = k2 = −1.) For more details, see exterior algebra.|$|E

[...] "Very little was based on the stories that Matt Drudge himself wrote. The fact that the Drudge Report appears left of center is merely a reflection of the overall bias of the media." [...] Professor Mark Liberman critiqued the statistical model used in this study on the basis that model assumed conservative politicians do not care about the ideological position of think tanks they cite, while liberal politicians do. The study was also criticized by media watchdog Spinwatch for its methodology and its authors' ties to conservative think tanks.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} an imaginative remedy {{can be found in}} the {{landmark}} case Doucet-Boudreau, (2003) 3 S.C.R. 3, as the claimants challenged the Nova Scotia government's delay in building French language schools as a breach of their section 23 rights. [...] A lower-court judge had ruled in the claimants' favour, and then demanded the government report to him as construction progressed. [...] Despite the Supreme Court minority's objections that this use of section 24 violated [...] "fundamental justice" [...] and the [...] "functus officio" [...] rule, in which a judge makes a ruling and afterwards has no role to play, the majority upheld the earlier decision. [...] As the majority argued, section 24 is [...] "responsive to the needs of a given case," [...] and as such [...] "novel remedies" [...] may not only be permissible, but also required. [...] The [...] "appropriate and just" [...] limit was defined in this case as giving the courts themselves the right to determine what is appropriate and just (although they <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind traditional common law limits on judicial power; in this case it was denied that functus officio was violated), and also as requiring courts to remember that section 24 is itself a part of the constitution and allows judges to carry out their function of enforcing rights.|$|E
2500|$|The capital {{expenditure}} {{to build the}} facility mostly depends on the physical characteristics of the reservoir. First of all, the development cost of a storage facility largely depends {{on the type of}} the storage field. As a general rule of thumb, salt caverns are the most expensive to develop on a Bcf of Working Gas Capacity Basis. However one <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> mind that because the gas in such facilities can be cycled repeatedly, on a Deliverability basis, they may be less costly. A Salt Cavern facility might cost anywhere from $10 million to $25 million/Bcf of working gas capacity. The wide price range is because of region difference which dictates the geological requirements. These factors include the amount of compressive horsepower required, the type of surface {{and the quality of the}} geologic structure to name a few. A depleted reservoir costs between $5 million to $6 million/Bcf of Working Gas Capacity. Finally another major cost incurred when building new storage facilities is that of base gas. [...] The amount of base gas in a reservoir could be as high as 80% for aquifers making them very unattractive to develop when gas prices are high. On the other hand, salt caverns require the least amount of base gas. The high cost of base gas is what drives the expansion of current sites vs the development of new ones. This is because expansions require little addition to base gas.|$|E

2500|$|The report {{commissioned}} from Atkins Global by Rochdale council, {{at a cost}} of £80,000, {{was published}} in July 2006 and claimed that previous tests on the land, carried out on behalf of the developers, were not thorough enough, and that extensive work would be required before councillors should even consider the controversial planning application. Atkins Global also claimed {{that the majority of the}} developers' tests did not detect the true levels of asbestos in the soil. The report concluded that [...] "the presence of asbestos cannot be ruled out across much of the site." [...] In June 2007, Countryside Properties withdrew from the joint planning application. MMC released a statement saying: [...] "Countryside Properties Ltd has withdrawn from the planning application for a mixed use scheme on the former Turner Brothers site because they became disillusioned with the apparent unwillingness of the town planning department to deal with the application as a result of the ill-founded and negative publicity generated by Jason Addy's campaign.
