He was stabbed twice before his secretary, Jean Tamaki, found William Luthin attacking the bishop with a [...] "dagger-like" [...] knife. Tamaki was able to pull Luthin away by his shirt because the attacker was of [...] "medium or small build." [...] Bell {{had been in his}} office preparing for a trip to see Pope John Paul II in Chicago, Illinois. Luthin surrendered himself at a hospital and was found {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity. Police arrested Luthin as a suspect because he told nurses, [...] "Call somebody. I stabbed a priest."
