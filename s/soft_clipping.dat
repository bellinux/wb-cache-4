5000|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>clipping</b> {{is a very}} {{important}} aspect of tube sound especially for guitar amplifiers. A hi-fi amplifier should not normally ever be driven into clipping. The harmonics added to the signal are of lower energy with <b>soft</b> <b>clipping</b> than hard clipping. However, <b>soft</b> <b>clipping</b> is not exclusive to tubes. It can be simulated in transistor circuits (below the point that real hard clipping would occur). (See [...] "Intentional distortion" [...] section).|$|E
50|$|Clipping may be {{described}} as hard, {{in cases where the}} signal is strictly limited at the threshold, producing a flat cutoff; or it may {{be described}} as soft, in cases where the clipped signal continues to follow the original at a reduced gain. Hard clipping results in many high frequency harmonics; <b>soft</b> <b>clipping</b> results in fewer higher order harmonics and intermodulation distortion components.|$|E
5000|$|... "Gain compression" [...] in RF {{amplifiers}} {{is similar}} to <b>soft</b> <b>clipping.</b> However, in narrowband systems, the effect [...] "looks" [...] more like gain compression simply because the harmonics are filtered out after amplification. Many data sheets for RF amplifiers list gain compression rather than distortion figures because it's easier to measure and {{is more important than}} distortion figures in nonlinear RF amplifiers.|$|E

5000|$|Vacuum tube or [...] "valve" [...] {{distortion}} {{is achieved}} by [...] "overdriving" [...] the valves in an amplifier. In layperson's terms, overdriving is pushing the tubes beyond their normal rated maximum. Valve amplifiers—particularly those using class-A triodes—tend to produce asymmetric <b>soft</b> <b>clipping</b> that creates both even and odd harmonics. The increase in even harmonics is considered to create [...] "warm"-sounding overdrive effects.|$|E
50|$|Male crickets of {{this species}} produce several {{distinctive}} chirps, though each sound is made by rubbing the two outer wings together. Loud and steady chirps made throughout the night are to attract females and to warn off other males. Loud fast-frequency chirps are emitted when males encounter one another and are preparing to fight. They are intended to frighten off the rival male. A <b>soft</b> <b>clipping</b> sound is made when a female {{is known to be}} nearby. Its purpose is to encourage the female to mate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>clipping</b> is {{also not}} a product of lack of {{feedback}} alone: Tubes have different characteristic curves. Factors such as bias affect the load line and clipping characteristics. Fixed and cathode-biased amplifiers behave and clip differently under overdrive. The type of phase inverter circuitry can also affect greatly on softness (or lack of it) of clipping: long-tailed pair circuit, for example, has softer transition to clipping than a cathodyne. The coupling of the phase inverter and power tubes is also important, since certain types of coupling arrangements (e.g. transformer coupling) can drive power tubes to class AB2, while some other types can't.|$|E
40|$|Formalin fixing with {{paraffin}} embedding (FFPE) {{has been a}} standard sample preparation method for decades, and archival FFPE samples are still very useful resources. Nonetheless, the use of FFPE samples in cancer genome analysis using next-generation sequencing, which is a powerful technique for the identification of genomic alterations at the nucleotide level, has been challenging due to poor DNA quality and artificial sequence alterations. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of matched frozen samples and FFPE samples of tissues from 4 cancer patients and compared the next-generation sequencing data obtained from these samples. The major differences between data obtained from the 2 types of sample were the shorter insert size and artificial base alterations in the FFPE samples. A high proportion of short inserts in the FFPE samples resulted in overlapping paired reads, {{which could lead to}} overestimation of certain variants; > 20 % of the inserts in the FFPE samples were double sequenced. A large number of <b>soft</b> <b>clipped</b> reads was found in the sequencing data of the FFPE samples, and about 30 % of total bases were <b>soft</b> <b>clipped.</b> The artificial base alterations, C>T and G>A, were observed in FFPE samples only, and the alteration rate ranged from 200 to 1, 200 per 1 M bases when sequencing errors were removed. Although high-confidence mutation calls in the FFPE samples were compatible to that in the frozen samples, caution should be exercised in terms of the artifacts, especially for low-confidence calls. Despite the clearly observed artifacts, archival FFPE samples can be a good resource for discovery or validation of biomarkers in cancer research based on whole-exome sequencing...|$|R
40|$|Copy number {{variations}} (CNVs) {{are associated}} with many complex diseases. Next generation sequencing data enable one to identify precise CNV breakpoints to better under the underlying molecular mechanisms and to design more efficient assays. Using the CIGAR strings of the reads, we develop a method that can identify the exact CNV breakpoints, and in cases when the breakpoints are in a repeated region, the method reports a range where the breakpoints can slide. Our method identifies the breakpoints of a CNV using both the positions and CIGAR strings of the reads that cover breakpoints of a CNV. A read with a long <b>soft</b> <b>clipped</b> part (denoted as $S$ in CIGAR) at its 3 &# 39;(right) end {{can be used to}} identify the 5 &# 39;(left) -side of the breakpoints, and a read with a long $S$ part at the 5 &# 39; end can be used to identify the breakpoint at the 3 &# 39;-side. To ensure both types of reads cover the same CNV, we require the overlapped common string to include both of the <b>soft</b> <b>clipped</b> parts. When a CNV starts and ends in the same repeated regions, its breakpoints are not unique, in which case our method reports the left most positions for the breakpoints and a range within which the breakpoints can be incremented without changing the variant sequence. We have implemented the methods in a C++ package intended for the current Illumina Miseq and Hiseq platforms for both whole genome and exon-sequencing. Our simulation studies have shown that our method compares favorably with other similar methods in terms of true discovery rate, false positive rate and breakpoint accuracy. Our results from a real application have shown that the detected CNVs are consistent with zygosity and read depth information. The software package is available at [URL]...|$|R
5000|$|The piezo pickup gives a {{very wide}} {{frequency}} range output compared to the magnetic types and can give large amplitude signals from the strings. For this reason, the buffer amplifier is often powered from relatively high voltage rails (about ±9 V) to avoid distortion due to clipping. A less linear preamp (like a single-FET amplifier) might be preferable due to <b>softer</b> <b>clipping</b> characteristics. Such an amplifier starts to distort sooner, which makes the distortion less [...] "buzzy" [...] and less audible than a more linear, but less forgiving op-amp. However, at least one study indicates that most people can not {{tell the difference between}} FET and op-amp circuits in blind listening comparisons of electric instrument preamps, which correlates with results of formal studies of other types of audio devices. Sometimes, piezoelectric pickups are used in conjunction with magnetic types to give a wider range of available sounds.|$|R
5000|$|The {{white clipper}} is a circuit that clips out the excess level of video signal. It is {{especially}} important for those transmitters that receive signals from other transmitters through professional receivers. The circuit has two parallel arms. In the first arm a Zener diode clips out the signal in excess of 1 volt. In the second arm, the chrominance signal bypasses the Zener diode through a band pass filter. Sometimes it is necessary or desirable to create a <b>soft</b> <b>clipping</b> action where some highlight detail can be preserved in high contrast scenes. This is known as a [...] "knee" [...] circuit after the shape of the transfer characteristic graph.|$|E
5000|$|In other words, <b>soft</b> <b>clipping</b> is not {{exclusive}} to vacuum tubes {{or even an}} inherent property of them. In practice the clipping characteristics are largely dictated by the entire circuitry and as so they can range from very soft to very hard, depending on circuitry. Same applies to both vacuum tube and solid-state -based circuitry. For example, solid-state circuitry such as operational transconductance amplifiers operated open loop, or MOSFET cascades of CMOS inverters, are frequently used in commercial applications to generate softer clipping than what is provided by generic triode gain stages. In fact, the generic triode gain stages can be observed to clip rather [...] "hard" [...] if their output is scrutinized with an oscilloscope.|$|E
50|$|Harmonic {{distortion}} adds overtones {{that are}} whole number multiples {{of a sound}} wave's frequencies. Nonlinearities {{that give rise to}} amplitude distortion in audio systems are most often measured in terms of the harmonics (overtones) added to a pure sinewave fed to the system. Harmonic distortion may be expressed in terms of the relative strength of individual components, in decibels, or the root mean square of all harmonic components: Total harmonic distortion (THD), as a percentage. The level at which harmonic distortion becomes audible depends on the exact nature of the distortion. Different types of distortion (like crossover distortion) are more audible than others (like <b>soft</b> <b>clipping)</b> even if the THD measurements are identical. Harmonic distortion in radio frequency applications is rarely expressed as THD.|$|E
5000|$|Fuzz bass can be {{produced}} by overloading a bass amp's tube or transistor preamplifier, by using a bass fuzz or bass overdrive effect pedal, or for the most powerful effect, by combining both approaches. In the 1960s and early 1970s fuzz bass was associated with psychedelic music (e.g., Edgar Broughton Band), progressive rock (e.g., Genesis), and psychedelic soul/funk (e.g., Sly and the Family Stone) styles, and it tended to be a [...] "warmer", [...] "smoother", and [...] "softer" [...] overdrive-type sound caused by <b>soft,</b> symmetrical <b>clipping</b> of the audio signal which [...] "rounded off the signal peaks rather than razor-slicing" [...] them and filtered out the harsher high harmonics.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} {{multistage}} multi-user detector for Code Division Multiple Access that implements Mean-Field Annealing. Annealing {{is a well}} known technique to avoid local minima in detection and optimisation problems. Local minima certainly occurs in CDMA multi-user detection leading to anomalous Bit Error Rate curves. Annealing is implemented as a standard multi-user detector implementing interference cancellation, but with a control parameter determining {{the slope of the}} squashing/mapping function. We derive a bound on the control parameter for the first stage of the detector. We also propose an annealing scheme. We show empirically the performance of the proposed detector, which follows closely the optimum detector implemented by exhaustive search, i. e. has gains of several dB’s compared to standard multiuser detectors like linear-MMSE, linear-MMSE first stage followed by interference cancellation, and multi-stage interference cancellation with <b>clipped</b> <b>soft</b> decision, the last being the closest to our proposed detector. The proposed detector gains up to dB compared to the <b>Clipped</b> <b>Soft</b> Decision Multistage detector at no added complexity...|$|R

5000|$|Some audiophiles {{believe that}} the {{clipping}} behavior of vacuum tubes {{with little or no}} negative feedback is superior to that of transistors, in that vacuum tubes clip more gradually than transistors (i.e. <b>soft</b> <b>clipping,</b> and mostly even harmonics), resulting in harmonic distortion that is generally less objectionable. In general though, the distortion associated with clipping is unwanted, and is visible on an oscilloscope even if it is inaudible. Even in a transistorised amplifier with hard clipping, the gain of the transistor will be reducing (leading to nonlinear distortion) as the output current increases and the voltage across the transistor reduces close to the saturation voltage (for bipolar transistors), and so [...] "full power" [...] for the purposes of measuring distortion in amplifiers is usually taken as a few percent below clipping.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} several {{different}} digital <b>soft</b> <b>clipping</b> algorithms are described and analysed. It is discussed how {{the quality of}} each algorithm can be estimated. A testing methodology is devised to show the levels of nonlinearities produced {{as a function of}} the input signal amplitude. It is proposed that, while all <b>soft</b> <b>clipping</b> algorithms produce higher order nonlinearities, the instability of the produced harmonics plays a crucial role in the transparency of the effect. Existing and novel clipping algorithms are thus compared and classified based on their measured properties, including total harmonic distortion and inter-modulation distortion estimates. This paper proposes a conclusion related to the quality and properties of different algorithms...|$|E

His SIT amplifiers are {{the first of a}} new generation of audio amplifiers using Static Induction Transistors in a single-stage, single-ended, Class A circuit without feedback or degeneration. The SIT chip combines a square-law input character with a low impedance output to form the only solid-state gain device, which Pass claims, [...] "behaves like a triode tube." [...] There is no output transformer on the SIT amps. The point of the SIT is that it behaves like a triode but at lower voltages and higher currents, so it doesn't need a matching transformer to deliver power to 8 Ohms. Like tubes, SITs have <b>soft</b> overload <b>clipping.</b> When brief bursts of musical energy occur, SITs react with rounded waveform tops instead of sharp and hard clipping of solid-state. SITs have a curve which looks a lot like a triode vacuum tube; low at first and climbs steadily. The distortion curve is similar, a steady rise instead of a valley with high distortion at both ends.|$|R
40|$|We {{show how}} {{expander}} based arguments {{may be used}} to prove that message passing algorithms can correct a linear number of erroneous messages. The implication of this result is that when the block length is sufficiently large, once a message passing algorithm has corrected a sufficiently large fraction of the errors, it will eventually correct all errors. This result is then combined with known results on the ability of message passing algorithms {{to reduce the number of}} errors to an arbitrarily small fraction for relatively high transmission rates. The results hold for various message passing algorithms, including Gallager’s hard decision and <b>soft</b> decision (with <b>clipping)</b> decoding algorithms.

Subjective testing shows that listeners can perceive differences in these profiles, through differences in quantitative ratings of quality and qualitative descriptions of quality.

The derived method benefits from the advantages of classical clipping and filtering method and exhibits small computational complexity as compared to other peak reduction methods. In this paper, we show, thanks to extensive simulation results, that our method offers a global gain, greater than 1 dB. That means that the power efficiency of the Power Amplifier (PA) increases of about 3. 2 % which corresponds to a PA consumption gain of about 10 %...|$|E

50|$|The {{ski boot}} {{provides}} four functions; protecting the foot from the elements, providing a mounting {{point for the}} binding, and transmitting forces between the leg and the ski. In theory, there's no reason these have to be combined in a single unit, and several designs have split these functions up. One example is the Nava System from the 1980s, which used a <b>soft</b> boot that <b>clipped</b> into custom bindings, and an arm that extended up from the rear binding to wrap around the leg and provide lateral control. Several newer designs have been attempted over time, notably the Apex Ski Boot that uses a relatively small carbon fibre framework that clips into conventional bindings and provides lateral control, and a semi-soft boot for comfort and protection. The Apex design is similar to some inline skates that feature step-out shoes, and has a strong resemblance to snowboard binding systems.|$|R
30|$|One of the {{simplest}} and most popular prevention techniques is soft-clipping which reduces high peaks by artificially limiting the maximum amplitude of any time-domain sample to a pre-defined threshold before it {{is applied to the}} amplifier (Ochiai and Imai 2000). The clipping is a non-linear process which introduces bit-errors at the receiver in a hard to predict manner. This paper discusses a novel method for correcting the bit-errors introduced by <b>soft</b> <b>clipping,</b> which we call the Equation-Method. The basis of the method is the generation of a set of simultaneous equations from the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) equations taking the clipped time-domain samples as unknowns. When the equations are solved, the amplitude of the time-domain samples, before clipping, are found thereby effectively reversing the clipping at the receiver. This paper expands on our previous work by more thoroughly analyzing the theoretical foundations of the method (Bibi et al. 2013).|$|E
