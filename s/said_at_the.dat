5|$|Harper was {{the only}} Reform MP to support the {{creation}} of the Canadian Firearms Registry at second reading in 1995, although he later voted against it at third reading stage. He <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time that he initially voted for the registry because of a poll showing that most of his constituents supported it, and added that he changed his vote when a second poll showed the opposite result. It was reported in April 1995, that some Progressive Conservatives opposed to Jean Charest's leadership wanted to remove both Charest and Manning, and unite the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties under Harper's leadership.|$|E

In commemoration of the franchise's 20th anniversary, Square released figurines of him alongside other Final Fantasy protagonists.

5|$|During the 2011 Canadian federal election, Harper {{promised to}} {{establish}} the NAP-CHT by 2012 and to invest $20 million into it. The annual budget of British Columbia's Office to Combat Trafficking in Persons (OCTIP) was reduced by $200,000 a few months later. OCTIP was Canada's only provincial government agency responsible for coordinating efforts to address human trafficking. The federal government held a round table to determine {{the contents of the}} NAP-CHT. Carleen McGuinty, child protection specialist for the Christian NGO World Vision Canada, <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> discussion that the NAP-CHT should focus on the needs of children and that the plan should not emphasize child sexual abuse to the exclusion of addressing child labour. Smith said that she was confident that Harper would have her review the plan before it was established. The government consulted ACT Alberta, The Salvation Army, and the AAMS {{in the development of the}} plan.|$|E
5|$|In June 1976, Gravel was {{the focus}} of a federal {{investigation}} into allegations that he was involved in a sex-for-vote arrangement. Congressional staff clerk Elizabeth Ray (who was already the subject of a sex scandal that led to the downfall of Representative Wayne Hays) stated that in August 1972, she had sex with Gravel aboard a houseboat on the Potomac River, under the instruction of Representative Kenneth J. Gray, her boss at the time. Gray allegedly wanted to secure Gravel's support for further funding for construction of the National Visitor Center in Washington, a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired. Another Congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter, but Gravel <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time that he had never met either of the women. Both Gravel and Gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation, and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing. Decades later, Gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with Ray, but had not changed any votes because of it.|$|E

Meredith was first called up by Australia for a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Jordan on 8 October 2015, for which he was an unused substitute as Australia lost 2–0. Meredith debuted for Australia on 12 November 2015, after being selected in the starting line-up for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Kyrgyzstan, which the team won 3–0 at home.

5|$|Muin-i Zafer {{was reduced}} to a {{stationary}} ship in İzmir in 1910, at which point her armament {{was reduced to}} just two of the 75mm guns and four 57mm guns. In September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire, initiating the Italo-Turkish War. At the start of the war, Muin-i Zafer was stationed as a guard ship in Beirut. She left shortly after the onset of hostilities, however, and on 30 September arrived in Port <b>Said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> northern end of the Suez Canal. There, she was disarmed and her guns were taken ashore to strengthen the local defenses. By the start of the First Balkan War in October 1912, Muin-i Zafer had been moved back to İzmir. In 1913, she became a torpedo training ship based in Constantinople. The ship was converted into a floating barracks in 1920 stationed in İzmit. In 1928, the vessel was converted again, into a depot ship for submarines at Erdek. She served in that capacity for four years before being decommissioned in 1932; she was broken up for scrap in 1934.|$|E
5|$|Three more {{individuals}} {{who say they}} had unprotected sex with Usher sued him on allegations of fraud, sexual battery, infliction of emotional distress and more, alleging that he was positive for the herpes virus and didn't tell them in advance. All three are represented by attorney Lisa Bloom who <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> news conference on 8 August 2017 {{that one of her}} three clients had contracted genital herpes allegedly from Usher. One of the accusers, Quantasia Sharpton, said she had unprotected sex with him after a concert she attended around her 19th birthday.

5|$|White Star then {{ordered a}} new 212-foot bow section from Harland and Wolff in Belfast, which was {{launched}} head-first in October 1907. It was popularly <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time that Suevic {{was the longest}} ship in the world, with her bow in Belfast and her stern in Southampton. The new bow was then towed to the shipyard of J.I. Thornycroft in Southampton, where it arrived on 26 October. By mid-November it was in position and being joined {{to the rest of}} the ship. The bow was a good fit, a testimony to the craftsmanship of the Harland and Wolff shipwrights. Ten months later, after the largest ship rebuilding effort ever undertaken at the time, on 14 January 1908, Suevic was completed and returned to service.|$|E
5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he will encounter at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E
