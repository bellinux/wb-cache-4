50|$|The six main Black's Township {{settlers}} {{decided to}} form a company to negotiate with CSR to supply the Victoria Mill with cane. They called themselves the Herbert River Farmers Association and included: Harald Hoffensetz, August Anderssen, Austin W Carr, Niels C Rosendahl, John Alm, and Francis Herron. These men were forerunners of the small farm and central mill system which would characterize the sugar industry. They also {{put a lot of}} effort into improving their district. For example, in 1883 they approached the Hinchinbrook Divisional Board for a road to be made from the wharf to Cordelia Vale. This would then provide an important <b>service</b> <b>link</b> with Ingham. When the Divisional Board was unwilling to commit funds to the project the Herbert River Farmers Association cleared a track to Cordelia Vale themselves.|$|E
50|$|Taganskaya {{opened in}} 1966 {{as part of}} the start of the Zdanovsky (now Tagansky) radius. The station's {{decoration}} is sparse yet stylish for the 1960s functional designs. Because the deep pylon trivault offers more potential for decorations, architects Nina Alyoshina and Yury Vdovin exploited this. Decorating the white marbled pylons with brown marble stripes. Likewise the white and black ceramic tiles and are decorated with metallic artworks with a space theme. The floor is covered with red and grey granite. The underground vestibule of the station is interlinked with the subway under the Bolshaya Kammenka street. The surface staircases of which are protected from the weather with glazed concrete pavilions (the first in Moscow).

50|$|In 2007, Del Mastro lobbied the Harper {{government}} to reopen a passenger train <b>service</b> <b>link</b> from Peterborough to Toronto that {{was cut by}} Via Rail seventeen years earlier. He estimated that the track upgrades would cost $150 million and that the service would be used by nine hundred people daily. In February 2008, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty announced that his government would reopen the line. Although locally popular, this plan was widely criticized as impractical, improperly planned, and designed for political gain. Some editorials noted that the line would travel through several Conservative ridings, including Flaherty's own. A 2010 study commissioned by the provincial and federal governments estimated that capital costs for the project would run between $541 million and $1.5 billion. Del Mastro criticized these figures and accused the study's creators of bias, while acknowledging that the project would probably not move forward if assessed {{solely on the basis}} of that one report. In 2011, Del Mastro promised that the first passenger train would leave Peterborough on July 1, 2014.|$|E
50|$|The {{neighborhood}} {{suffered a}} severe economic {{decline in the}} latter half of the 20th century, largely as a result of the shift of development and commercial activity to the center of the island, following the construction of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The North Shore Branch of the Staten Island Railway that ran through the neighborhood connecting it to St. George was mainly a freight railroad. It was owned by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and was briefly, in 1925 and 1926, used as a passenger <b>service</b> <b>link</b> to the ferry launch at St. George. This was suspended as the boat ride was slower than the trip usual B & O trip to its usual terminal at the CNJ Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey. During World War II some trains were used to move troops. This branch was closed in 1953, leaving behind a dilapidated track and Port Richmond station along Richmond (now Port Richmond) Avenue. Plans for reopening this line were studied at various times during the 1990s and early 2000s as a Staten Island light rail line.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} years of 21st century this bridge was left as the only tram <b>service</b> <b>link</b> leading from Vassilievskiy Island. The {{remaining}} service (Routes 6 and 40) takes passengers from the island, relieving its rush-hour-crowded Vassileostrosvskaya metro station via much less busy Sportivnaya metro station and, again, busy Gorkovskaya metro station on the main island of Petrogradskiy District, to Vyborgskiy District in the north bank of the Neva. All other tram lines over bridges from Vassilievskiy Island have been removed together with severe {{reduction in the number of}} tram routes still popular especially with lower-income population groups, and even the other line from Tuchkov Bridge branching off to Chkalovskiy Prospect (left turn from the bridge) was closed. There may be observed certain tensions between the growing number of car owners and underprivileged users of public transportations. There used to be about a dozen tram routes in and out of Vassilievskiy Island before the reduction in 1990s, while even the renovated to be quieter the Sredniy Prospect tram line (virtually the only one remaining in the island) was nearly permanently closed soon after renovation.|$|E
