5|$|Although both <b>shows</b> <b>are</b> set in {{the same}} hospital, the Casualty set in Bristol was not large enough to {{encompass}} the surgical ward and operating theatre required for Holby City, so the series was produced at the BBC's Elstree Studios in north London. As a result, some crossover scenes had to be shot twice, first on the Casualty set and then again at Elstree, with cast members travelling between the two locations. McHale wrote the series' first episode, and served as the show's lead writer. Holby City premiered on 12 January 1999 on BBC One.

5|$|Fordham College at Rose Hill has a {{long history}} of college theater, as well as non-major theater groups at both Lincoln Center and Rose Hill (the Mimes and Mummers, Fordham Experimental Theater, the Theatrical Outreach Group, Splinter Group). There are also choirs (University Choir, Schola Cantorum, Gloria Dei Choir) and a cappella groups {{spanning}} both campuses (Fordham Ramblers, Satin Dolls, b-Sides, Hot Notes, F-sharps).

The Mimes put on two musicals, a drama, and a comedy each year – all non-student-written shows – as well as workshops designed to help students at Fordham learn about theater.

5|$|Imagery {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of the Orb's persona. This is most prominent during live performances, where they often project surreal images against onstage screens. Common images include morphing faces, futuristic cityscapes, and aliens. They have long associated their act with absurd symbology with images such as floating pigs. This has carried over to their music videos, most of which are spacy, brightly coloured montages of surreal images including astronauts, clouds, and neon dolphins. Because of their use of psychedelic images at shows, the Orb's <b>shows</b> <b>are</b> frequently compared to those of Pink Floyd, who also used in-show imagery and films. Paterson cites Godfrey Reggio's and Philip Glass's film Koyaanisqatsi as a primary influence to their concert imagery.|$|E
