5000|$|In April 1895, the German Emperor Wilhelm II had a {{nightmare}} {{where all the}} nations of Europe appeared as [...] "prehistoric warrior goddesses" [...] who were protected by Germany which {{took the form of}} the Archangel Michael. To the East, they were threatened by a dark, <b>stormy</b> <b>cloud</b> in which a Chinese-style dragon carried a Buddha wreathed in fire under which marched millions of Asians who destroyed all in their path, killing all whites. After his nightmare, which Wilhelm regarded as a message from God about the coming, apocalyptic great [...] "race war" [...] between Europe and Asia which would decide the future of the 20th century, he had a painting of his nightmare done by his court painter Hermann Knackfuss in September 1895. The painting, which was known as the Yellow Peril painting was very popular in its time. Ehrenfels saw the Yellow Peril painting in December 1895 and was greatly impressed. From 1895 onwards, Ehrenfels was greatly influenced by the [...] "Yellow Peril" [...] propaganda put out by the German government, in which Wilhelm repeatedly warned of the alleged Asian menace to the West. As a Wagnerite who deeply involved in the various Wagner societies in Vienna, Ehrenfels got to know Prince Philip von Eulenburg, the German ambassador to Austria-Hungary and an anti-Asian racist who promoted the fear of the [...] "Yellow Peril" [...] to anybody who would listen. More broadly, Ehrenfels's [...] "Yellow Peril" [...] anti-Asian racism was part of an environment in which non-white men were depicted as threatening to rape white women. In this racist viewpoint, to protect their women from being raped, white men would have to wage a [...] "primitive" [...] and [...] "primordial" [...] racial war against the [...] "Yellow Peril", which justified both white supremacy and male supremacy. The same sort of language and imagery was always frequently invoked with the fears about a [...] "race war" [...] with the blacks and the Jews. European racists often considered the Jews to be a race apart from the rest of humanity, and so the Jews were lumped in with the blacks and the Asians.|$|E
5000|$|In 1884, the French {{efforts to}} conquer Vietnam led to war {{breaking}} out between France and China. The Sino-French War led to immediate revival {{of interest in}} Gobineau's anti-Asian writings in France, and several French newspapers reprinted the French original of Gobineau's 1881 article in the Bayreuther Blätter, together with a translation of Wagner's introduction warning about the imminent Chinese threat to European civilization. Likewise, the Franco-Chinese war led to the Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines becoming popular in France. The book had been published in four volumes (each about 1, 000 pages long) in 1853-55, and remained out of print for decades. In 1884, just after the war with China began, the second edition and third editions of the Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines were published in Paris, which was {{a direct result of}} the war, as many French people suddenly became interested in a book that had such an unflattering picture of Asians. The American historian Gregory Blue wrote that, for Gobineau, China was a [...] "deadly, soulless menace" [...] to the [...] "white race", the merciless agent of impending destruction of everything good in the world. Much of the imagery from Amadis appears in the infamous painting [...] "The Yellow Peril" [...] by Hermann Knackfuss, which was inspired by a nightmare Kaiser Wilhelm II had in April 1895, in which millions of Asians marched under a dark, <b>stormy</b> <b>cloud</b> in which was a dragon carrying a Buddha wreathed in flames, bringing death and destruction to Europe. As the first sketch of what was to become the painting done by the Kaiser, it differs from the finished product of September 1895, being considerably more nightmarish, disturbing and terrifying. Blue suggested that there was an [...] "Eulenburg connection" [...] at work here, arguing that Prince von Eulenburg, who was probably Gobineau's lover and who certainly was the best friend of Wilhelm II, had introduced themes from Gobineau's anti-Asian writings into The Yellow Peril, as Knackfuss turned the sketch provided by Wilhelm into a painting. The striking similarities between Gobineau's anti-Asian writings and The Yellow Peril painting can be best explained as Eulenburg, who knew well the writings of his [...] "unforgettable friend" [...] Gobineau, being deeply involved in helping Knackfuss turn the sketch Wilhelm had given him into a painting that could be presented in public.|$|E

60|$|In creed, the English were pagans, {{having a}} {{religion}} of beliefs {{rather than of}} rites. Their chief deity, perhaps, {{was a form of}} the old Aryan Sky-god, who took with them the guise of Thunor or Thunder (in Scandinavian, Thor), an angry warrior hurling his hammer, the thunder-bolt, from the <b>stormy</b> <b>clouds.</b> These thunder-bolts were often found buried in the earth; and being really the polished stone-axes of the earlier inhabitants, they do actually resemble a hammer in shape. But Woden, the special god of the Teutonic race, had practically usurped the highest place in their mythology: he is represented {{as the leader of the}} Germans in their exodus from Asia to north-western Europe, and since all the pedigrees of their chieftains were traced back to Woden, it is not improbable that he may have been really a deified ancestor of the principal Germanic families. The popular creed, however, was mainly one of lesser gods, such as elves, ogres, giants, and monsters, inhabitants of the mark and fen, stories of whom still survive in English villages as folk-lore or fairy tales. A few legends of the pagan time are preserved for us in Christian books. Beowulf is rich in allusions to these ancient superstitions. If we may build upon the slender materials which alone are available, it would seem that the dead chieftains were buried in barrows, and ghost-worship was practised at their tombs. The temples were mere stockades of wood, with rude blocks or monoliths to represent deities and altars. Probably their few rites consisted merely of human or other sacrifices to the gods or the ghosts of departed chiefs. There was a regular priesthood of the great gods, but each man was priest for his own household.
