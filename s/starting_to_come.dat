It was apparent that despite Marden's insistence, many parents viewed the College as a finishing school.

Eventually, the club pulled themselves back up into Serie D (known as Campionato Interregionale at the time) for the 1981–82 season.|$|E

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{gave the}} season a 7.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "a fun, lighthearted, but fairly {{disposable}} piece of entertainment", noting that it improved through the season, especially following the Captain America: The Winter Soldier tie-in, {{and that by}} the end of the season, the series [...] "was <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into its own". Though he found the main cast's performances to all be good, and praised the strong guest and recurring stars, Goldman found the main characterizations to be weak during the first half of the season, and he also criticized the pacing of certain overarching plotlines, noting [...] "the mystery of Coulson's return, Skye's parentage, etc. – moved far too slow, with relatively minor revelations treated as though they were big reveals".|$|E

Annalee Newitz of io9 declared it to be [...] "one of the most rewarding episodes ever for people who love the show's mythology," [...] and found Olivia's universe-hopping ability to be [...] "truly cool". Newitz concluded that [...] "this was a truly awesome episode {{with a lot of}} payoff {{for those of us who}} have been glued to the set every Tuesday night, looking for answers." [...] The website later listed [...] "The Road Not Taken" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show. Television Without Pity graded the episode with a A-.|$|E
500|$|The Hammond organ was {{perceived}} as outdated by the late 1970s, particularly in the UK, where it was often used to perform pop songs in social clubs. Punk and new wave bands tended to prefer second-hand combo organs from the 1960s, or use no keyboards at all. Other groups started taking advantage of cheaper and more portable synthesizers that were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> onto the market. The Stranglers' Dave Greenfield was an exception to this, and used a Hammond onstage during the band's early career. Andy Thompson, better known for being an aficionado of the Mellotron, stated, [...] "the Hammond never really went away. There {{are a lot of}} studios that have had a B-3 or C-3 sitting away in there since the 70s." [...] The instrument underwent a brief renaissance in the 1980s with the mod revival movement. Taylor played the Hammond through the 1980s, first with the Prisoners and later with the James Taylor Quartet. The sound of the Hammond has appeared in hip-hop music, albeit mostly via samples. A significant use is the Beastie Boys' 1992 single [...] "So What'cha Want", which features a Hammond mixed into the foreground (the instrument was recorded live rather than being sampled).|$|E
500|$|The {{focus of}} the episode is Lady Gaga's song [...] "Born This Way", which she {{approved}} for use in Glee before the song premiered. This will be the second episode to highlight Gaga's music, the first one being season one's [...] "Theatricality". According to Monteith, the focus of [...] "Born This Way" [...] is the characters [...] "embracing the things about selves that [...] don't like and tailoring [...] performances around that." [...] It features homophobic Dave Karofsky <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{to terms with his}} homosexuality. The plot arc, which began in the season's sixth episode, [...] "Never Been Kissed", is intended by series creator Ryan Murphy to have a happy ending. He explained that, while someone like Karofsky could turn to drugs or alcohol or commit suicide, Glee is [...] "by nature optimistic", so he plans to conclude the storyline positively. For fellow closeted character Santana, [...] "Born This Way" [...] set up the final three episodes of the season, which will increase focus on her love for her best friend Brittany. The episode additionally marked the first appearance of guest star Dr. Shane, [...] "a very smart, cool and kind psychiatrist" [...] who may become a recurring character. Other characters seen in [...] "Born This Way" [...] include glee club members Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Sam Evans and Lauren Zizes, Kurt's boyfriend Blaine Anderson, school bully Azimio (James Earl), Principal Figgins, and Karofsky's father, Paul (Daniel Roebuck).|$|E

500|$|On January 11, 1967, the Experience {{worked on}} their second A-side, [...] "The Wind Cries Mary", {{a song that}} marked their first use of overdubbing in lieu of retakes {{as a method of}} {{achieving}} a satisfactory track. Chandler explained: [...] "There were five guitar overdubs all linking in together to sound like one guitar." [...] The song, which Redding and Mitchell had not yet heard before that day, was completed during the session. Chandler had decided that they should discard the rough version of [...] "Third Stone from the Sun" [...] from December 13 and re-record the song; they completed a basic track for the piece, but were unable to achieve a finished master. The group managed to produce an acceptable live recording of the basic track for [...] "Fire" [...] after seven takes. Next, they attempted Hendrix's newly written ballad, [...] "The Wind Cries Mary". Without the benefit of rehearsals, the band recorded the song in one take, to which Hendrix added several guitar overdubs; Chandler estimated that they spent approximately 20 minutes on the completed rhythm track. According to Chandler, by this time Redding and Mitchell had begun to complain about their limited input. Chandler explained that financial considerations influenced the creative dynamic: [...] " [...] were sort of fighting {{the fact that they had}} no say during recording sessions... they were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with suggestions, but... We didn't need to be arguing with Noel for ten minutes and Mitch for five... We just couldn't afford the time." ...|$|E

In the early 1950s, Armand set aside his dream to focus on developing his company's other tracked vehicles, {{but by the end}} of the decade, smaller, more efficient engines had been developed and were <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> onto the market. Bombardier resumed his efforts to build a [...] "miniature" [...] snowmobile. He worked alongside his eldest son Germain, who shared his father's mechanical talents. Armand and Germain developed several prototypes of the lightweight snowmobile and finally, the first Bombardier snowmobile went on sale in 1959.|$|E
2500|$|George W. Bush was {{symbolized by}} a Stetson hat atop the same {{invisible}} point, {{because he was}} Governor of Texas prior to his presidency (Trudeau {{accused him of being}} [...] "all hat and no cattle", reiterating the characterization of Bush by columnist Molly Ivins). The point became a giant asterisk (a la Roger Maris) following the 2000 presidential elections and the controversy over vote-counting. Later, President Bush's hat was changed to a Roman military helmet (again, atop an asterisk) representing imperialism. Towards the end of his first term, the helmet became battered, with the gilt work <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> off and with clumps of bristles missing from the top. By late 2008, the helmet had been dented almost beyond recognition.

At {{the end of}} the minor league season the Brewers {{recalled}} Glover to the major leagues, his first appearance there since {{the end of the}} 2003 season. Glover appeared in four games, starting three of them, and went 2–1 with a 3.50 ERA. After a strong spring training Glover began the [...] season as Milwaukee's fifth starter. Glover went 3-3 in his first nine starts but lost his spot in the starting rotation at the end of May to Wes Obermueller. Brewers manager Ned Yost cited Obermueller's hot streak: [...] "I'm going with what amounts to the hot hand even though Glover pitches great the last time...Gary's done everything we've asked of him but Obermueller is <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> on." [...] As in Chicago, Glover was disappointed. The move was not a success: Obermueller was rocked in two successive starts, while Glover was hit hard in relief and sent down to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds in early June to make room for backup catcher Julio Mosquera.|$|E
