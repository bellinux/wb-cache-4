25|$|These {{disputes}} {{continued for}} over a year. In November 2011 the court hearing the case ordered the couple into a week of mediation to resolve their issues. The session was reportedly a success, with the two eventually agreeing that Biryukova would have custody of both children while Solomon had full visitation. However, on November 3, shortly after the agreement had been signed, Biryukova called her lawyer and, saying <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> pressured into the session, decided to void it.|$|E

There, she defeated Antonella Serra Zanetti, Marta Domachowska, and Nicole Pratt before losing in the deciding-set tie-break after a very close second-round main-draw tussle against newly crowned US Open Champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, during which she held match points against Kuznetsova. The Russian afterwards praised her Chinese opponent, stating that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> as though she was up against a top-5 player.|$|E

25|$|The American Prospect {{noted in}} 2008 that Onyango risked being persecuted and {{tortured}} in Kenya if she returned, {{and said that}} risk to her family members had increased, {{whether or not she}} was deported, because of her asylum case having been leaked and widely publicized internationally. They also noted that due to the heightened danger in Kenya, her asylum claim in the US was bolstered. After her case was revealed in international media, Onyango traveled to stay with unidentified friends in Cleveland, Ohio. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> threatened in Boston, as people called and knocking on her door at all hours. The Boston police said that there was a problem with curiosity seekers and paparazzi.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Maria Pavlovna's son, Prince Lennart, {{came from}} Germany on a {{business}} visit that lasted several months. For {{the first time they}} genuinely got to know each other. Maria told Lennart, that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> lonely all of her life because of her rootless childhood. She spent much of her adulthood looking for love, having affairs, and finding it hard to fill the empty places inside of her. Two years later, Maria Pavlovna returned to Europe where, at the home of her son on the island of Mainau, in Germany, she re encountered her first husband, Prince Wilhelm of Sweden, {{for the first time in}} many years. They departed as good friends.|$|E
25|$|Erika arrives {{the next}} day and announces that they will take a trip to the village so she can obtain more {{information}} for her book. (The reader must assume that the village is in the Mühlviertel.) Hilde does not wish to go, yet {{does not want to be}} excluded. As they enter the village, Hilde recalls working hard in the fields to harvest the crop left behind by farmers to have enough food for their large family. She remembers the hunger pains and how her father could not find work. She remembers Fritzi, a member of her apartment-style household, bringing eggs and bacon on Sundays from the farmers and how <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> proud carrying the basket into the kitchen. She had wanted her mother to be more proud of her than she was of her older and prettier sister, Monika.|$|E
60|$|These {{wonderful}} words {{ran into}} the country girl's blood like hot scented wine. To be beautiful made some amends for being coarse and uncultured.

25|$|However, Charlotte did {{not allow}} herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, {{coincidence}} came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone {{in the dining room}} she noticed a small notebook lying open on in the drawer of Emily's portable writing desk and of my sister Emily's handwriting. She read it and was dazzled by the beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt,</b> more than surprise , a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music – wild, melancholy, and elevating. In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to calm down and days to be convinced to publish the poems.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{auditioning for}} Popstars, Chana {{said that she}} was {{frequently}} approached by executives from Latin music record labels. She explained that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> unprepared for a music career because of insecurities stemming from only performing karaoke and not having taken vocal classes. Chana also wanted to avoid conventional Latin pop, saying that she [...] "wanted {{to come up with something}} distinctive, even if the crowd would be niche".|$|E
500|$|Washington Post reporters later {{interviewed the}} accuser {{at the center}} of Erdely's story and two of the friends that Rolling Stone said she had met {{on the night of the}} incident.

50|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} that she lied about {{being part of}} the last Pi Li MIT, and that {{she was the one who}} caused the last Pi Li MIT to split up; with the leader breaking his leg when trying to help her. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>felt</b> guilty ever since then.|$|R
500|$|Jones's solicitors {{asked why}} she had changed her views so completely. [...] According to the {{allegations}} made in the subsequent claim for damages against her, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> under pressure to agree {{the wording of the}} document although it did not represent what she had agreed during the discussion and did not represent her true view, which was that Jones had had PTSD and had only been evasive not deceptive.

500|$|Excited by the {{possibilities}} presented by a recording medium {{which uses a}} person's own senses as the means of recording and playback, Brock and his team move into the room. They bombard it with their technology, hoping to find {{the secret of the}} [...] "stone tape" [...] and have it play on demand. Brock is certain that the secret is connected to the walls, but he fails to develop a predictable method of triggering. [...] Under mounting pressure to succeed, Brock uses every available instrumentation, only to be told, by Jill, that the presence <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> earlier was now gone, apparently meaning that the [...] "tape" [...] has been erased. Brock's failures are compounded when his superiors signal their lost confidence in him, requiring him to share Taskerlands with a rival research team working on a new washing machine.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, [...] "Women in Design", {{a student}} {{organization}} at the Harvard Graduate School of Design started a petition {{on behalf of}} Denise Scott Brown to receive joint recognition with her partner, past prize winner Robert Venturi, furthering a debate about sexism in architecture. The petition, according to The New York Times has [...] "reignited long-simmering tensions in the architectural world over whether women have been consistently denied the standing they deserve in a field whose most prestigious award was not given to a woman until 2004, when Zaha Hadid won." [...] Although the petition received international support of several past recipients, the jury said that it cannot revisit the work of past juries, in order to acknowledge the work of Denise Scott Brown and Lu Wenyu, both women and equal partners to their spouses Venturi and Wang Shu, who won in 1991 and 2012 respectively. Scott Brown told CNN that [...] "as a woman, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> excluded by the elite of architecture throughout her career," [...] and that [...] "the Pritzker Prize {{was based on the}} fallacy that great architecture was the work of a 'single lone male genius' at the expense of collaborative work." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rex Reed in his book People Are Crazy Here (1974), Baker revealed that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> pressure in both her working relationship with Levine, and her domestic life with her husband, the latter of whom she said wanted to maintain an expensive lifestyle: [...] "We'd been very poor when we started out at the Actors Studio in New York," [...] she told Reed. [...] "I was under contract to Joe Levine, who was going around giving me diamonds and behaving like he owned me. I never slept with him or anything, but everyone thought I was his mistress." [...] In the spring of 1966, Baker returned to theatre, performing in a production of Anna Christie at the Huntington Hartford Theater in Los Angeles. The production was directed by [...] Garfein. The production was heralded as the [...] "theatre event of the week" [...] in Los Angeles, though its reception was middling. Cecil Smith of The Los Angeles Times wrote of the production: [...] "The beautiful Miss Baker's vehicle becomes a hearse." [...] The play was also performed at the Tappan Zee Playhouse in Nyack, New York in June 1966.|$|E
500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E
500|$|Marjorie Baumgarten of Austin Chronicle {{referred}} to the film as being [...] "neither a true concert film nor a strict behind-the-scenes documentary, This Is It is, like Jackson himself, a real hybrid" [...] and felt that while the film's [...] "made up of lots of grainy footage, which Ortega has edited together seamlessly" [...] it will also [...] "provide a fitting farewell." [...] Baumgarten noted that [...] "the finished film is a fairly complete concert run-through with each song edited" [...] and that while the film will easily show that it was made for a profit, that, the audience will see a [...] "film to be a fitting elegy." [...] Joe Morgenstern, of The Wall Street Journal, felt the film was [...] "expertly packaged—brilliantly packaged," [...] and noted that the film [...] "quite convincingly" [...] had emphasized that Jackson had enough energy to perform, even with his [...] "wraith-thin body". Ann Powers, of Los Angeles Times {{said that while the}} film offers only a few such [...] "insights into Jackson's artistic process, though enough surface to make this a useful document, as well as a beautiful one" [...] that the film is [...] "a piece with Jackson's body of work: dazzling and strange, blurring the line between fantasy and reality." [...] She described Ortega's editing to make the film feel like a real concert film as being [...] "almost too good to believe." [...] Powers praised the film for showing [...] "intimate views" [...] of Jackson, like his [...] "vulnerable moments" [...] during performances and felt the film was made [...] "to honor not just the memory of Jackson but the hard work of a big cast and crew that never made it to opening night," [...] which she felt mostly is a tribute to the [...] "power of Jackson's body and voice." [...] Powers stated <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> the film was such [...] "a tragic teaser for the shows that might have been, 'This Is It' hurts. If Jackson had been able to perform as he frequently does during these scenes, he would have accomplished the comeback for which he was so hungry." [...] She noted that Jackson's [...] "total lack of engagement with the cameras adds to the unreal mood" [...] because he was always performing — [...] "but for the imagined masses, not for the filmgoer" [...] and that the film does not [...] "entirely acknowledge that reality, and that's a little odd." ...|$|E

60|$|She was dying: we saw it, {{and thanked}} God--for while she lived she could feel, and what must <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>felt?</b> <b>She</b> raised herself upon her bony hands, and blindly gazed around her, swaying her head slowly {{from side to}} side as a {{tortoise}} does.

500|$|Pfeiffer likened {{preparing}} {{herself for}} the role to a musician preparing to record an album, describing the process as twice as much work. At one point, she confessed to Kloves that {{she felt she was}} performing terribly; Kloves insisted that Pfeiffer is a poignant and insightful perfectionist. Producer Mark Rosenberg appreciated Pfeiffer for portraying Susie as a character who is [...] "so colorful and full of life that even Jack... has to perk up and pay attention". Pfeiffer decided to play her character in a way that ultimately uncovers [...] "the scared kid inside" [...] despite her profane and world-weary introduction. Although Pfeiffer was ultimately pleased with her singing, she sometimes doubted her own abilities while filming in fear that she might have [...] "outdone" [...] herself. Pfeiffer slightly slurred her speech to portray her character. Pfeiffer identified Susie's first scene, in which she walks into her audition demanding attention, as her most difficult to film because she initially struggled to channel her character's outgoing personality, which is different than her own introverted nature. A scene originally intended for the film in which Pfeiffer's character accidentally allows a bath she has begun pouring herself to overflow because she has become distracted thinking about Jack was ultimately edited out of the final film. Pfeiffer initially had reservations about performing atop a grand piano, fearing that it would appear [...] "silly" [...] and cause audience members to laugh. However, Kloves encouraged her to commit to the scene. Pfeiffer's short evening dress worn during the musical sequence was designed to be revealing enough without exposing Pfeiffer while she moves, which was choreographed by dancer Peggy Holmes. Pfeiffer touted her character [...] "one of the most alive characters that I've played", describing her as an [...] "emotional creature" [...] who is [...] "not afraid to take risks... doesn't lie to herself. If she makes a mistake, she doesn't blame anybody else. There's a purity in her honesty that I really respect", becoming a strong role model for the actress herself. Pfeiffer also credits Susie with helping her discover her own sexuality, prior to which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>felt</b> uncomfortable exploring. According to the Orlando Sentinels Kathy Huffhines, Susie [...] "has a harder shell, a sharper edge, and a franker sexiness" [...] than previous characters Pfeiffer has played. According to film critic David Thomson of The Independent, the role of Susie allowed Pfeiffer to add an aspect to her filmography, prior to which had been [...] "dutiful" [...] yet [...] "routine".|$|E

2500|$|On November 18, a Canadian Press story quoted her {{as saying}} Martin, and those around him, could [...] "go to hell" [...] {{if they wanted}} her to stop making similar comments.

In response to these comments, Martin, with the support of National Liberal Caucus chair Andy Savoy, expelled her from caucus, saying, [...] "Even though I respect her right to express her viewpoint, I cannot, as leader of our party and of our caucus, tolerate her behaviour." ...|$|E
