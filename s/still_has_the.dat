5|$|After the {{economic}} slump of the 1990s, {{the economy of}} the oblast started to rebound during {{the first decade of the}} 2000s, although at a rate below the country's average. Today the Kola Peninsula is the most industrially developed and urbanized region in northern Russia. The major port of the peninsula is Murmansk, which serves as the administrative center of Murmansk Oblast and does not freeze in winter. Although the strategic importance of the Kola Peninsula has diminished since the Cold War, the peninsula nevertheless <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> highest concentration of nuclear weapons, reactors, and facilities in Russia, with the number of nuclear reactors alone exceeding any other region of the world.|$|E

Thinking that Riley and Jasmine are going to arrive at Ellie's apartment, Sarah tells Ellie that Chuck knows Ellie lied to him and <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> laptop. However, Ellie and Sarah then realize that the laptop has been mistakenly taken by Ellie's husband Devon Woodcomb (Ryan McPartlin) to Chuck's bachelor party.|$|E

Before the broadcast starts, Kim presents Skylark with a puppy to keep.|$|E
5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{across the}} Narrow Sea in the {{continent}} of Essos, the exiled, arrogant Viserys Targaryen, son of the former king whose throne was usurped, believes he <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> rightful claim to the throne. He marries off his younger sister, Daenerys Targaryen, whom he has psychologically and physically abused for years, to {{the leader of the}} Dothraki warrior tribe, Khal Drogo, in an exchange for an army to return to Westeros and take the throne. However, Daenerys' growing love for Drogo and newfound mental strength as the Khaleesi of the tribe mean Viserys' plans go unexpectedly and powerfully awry.|$|E
5|$|The {{first floor}} {{comprises}} an entry hallway and two rooms. The hallways is set with tessellated tiles and <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> original desk for the visitor's book. Of the two rooms, {{one was the}} report room used for administrative work, record keeping and logbooks. It is currently used as a radio room. The second room housed a spare mantle holder. It currently houses the electrical controls, including the sensors responsible for starting the light. It also houses the backup batteries, backup diesel generator and fuel tank, {{as well as a}} small workshop.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{building}} is not well documented, {{although the majority of}} the present stone house was constructed in the 15th century on the site of a 12th-century wooden building. The current front wall was added in the 16th century. It {{has been used as a}} merchant's house and possibly a shop and school. It was thought that it was the venue for court proceedings, hence the title Tribunal, however there is no evidence this ever occurred. One of the ground floor rooms <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> window and ceiling panels from the Elizabethan era. The front room upstairs has an arched braced, wooden, truss roof.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} the closure has been questioned, as the United States <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> ability to conduct drone attacks from nearby bases in Afghanistan, and {{according}} to the Pakistani military, the base was used mainly for refuelling and maintenance of drones, as well as for emergency landings and logistical support, and not for conducting actual drone operations which had in fact ceased in April 2011. Following the incident, Pakistan stated its intention to shoot down any future US drones intruding on its airspace, and the US suspended drone operations to avoid antagonising Pakistan. One report said that American drone attacks in Pakistan dropped by as much as 50% due to the Salala attack, as well as legal cases.|$|E
5|$|The wooden stairs {{leading to}} the first floor {{replaced}} an earlier stone staircase, the remains of which can be seen protruding from the walls. The front room on the first floor had previously been partitioned, but the larger space was created when the new front wall was added to the building. Its roof has arched braced wooden trusses. The rear room <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> remains of a large fireplace, however, the chimney was blocked when the downstairs fireplace was installed.|$|E

Whilst the First Minister usually undertakes a number of foreign and international visits to promote Scotland, international relations, European and Commonwealth relations are also included within the portfolios of both the Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs (responsible for international development) and the Minister for International Development and Europe (responsible for European Union relations and international relations).|$|E

5|$|Given the {{universality}} of free fall, there is no observable distinction between inertial motion and motion {{under the influence of}} the gravitational force. This suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion, namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity. This new class of preferred motions, too, defines a geometry of space and time—in mathematical terms, it is the geodesic motion associated with a specific connection which depends on the gradient of the gravitational potential. Space, in this construction, <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> ordinary Euclidean geometry. However, spacetime as a whole is more complicated. As can be shown using simple thought experiments following the free-fall trajectories of different test particles, the result of transporting spacetime vectors that can denote a particle's velocity (time-like vectors) will vary with the particle's trajectory; mathematically speaking, the Newtonian connection is not integrable. From this, one can deduce that spacetime is curved. The resulting Newton–Cartan theory is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity using only covariant concepts, i.e. a description which is valid in any desired coordinate system. In this geometric description, tidal effects—the relative acceleration of bodies in free fall—are related to the derivative of the connection, showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass.|$|E
5|$|Identical to its {{predecessor}} however, {{the core of}} the gameplay is centred on the player's ability to make Robbit jump and shoot projectiles at enemies. Robbit can jump up to three times (as indicated by the new interface), allowing him to reach extreme heights in the game. As with the first instalment, Jumping Flash! 2 introduced new in-game power ups and weapons such as a powerful laser beam, missiles and trip mines. In addition to the new weapons, the player can find and use the older weapons in form of fireworks to deal massive damage to enemies. Other weapons include cherry bombs, rockets and Roman candles. The player <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> ability to shoot low-powered projectiles where a target reticle is centred {{in the middle of the}} screen.|$|E
5|$|The quandrangular watchtower, {{which was}} also the church's bell tower, was left {{unfinished}} by the Jesuits when they were expelled out of the country. The Augustinian Recollects, who succeeded the Jesuits, completed the watchtower. It is {{used to be a}} detached structure from the church and was connected after the addition of the portico. Made of coral stones, it also has a bas relief of Saint Andrew with an inscription of the date the tower was finished during Father San Andrés de la Santísima Trinidad's administration, May 20, 1777. It <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> original six out of the nine bells from 1880 to 1894 during Father Cabañas' terms. The seventh bell (1886) is in the church museum while the eight bell (1872) is given to the newly founded parish of Corella.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{reaching}} the surface, the party encounters {{the army of}} the elven city of Suldanessellar. The elves cannot return to the city, for Irenicus has magically hidden it. To gain access to it, the party secures the Rhynn Lanthorn from Bodhi, who has stolen the artifact; upon Bodhi's death, Imoen's soul is restored. The Rhynn Lanthorn lights the way to Suldanessellar, which has been invaded by Irenicus and his minions. The party proceeds through the city and, at the Tree of Life, learns that Irenicus is draining the power of the Tree, which will doom Suldanessellar. The heroes defeat him, but because Irenicus <b>still</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> protagonist's soul, the protagonist is dragged with the wizard into Hell, {{and the rest of the}} party are dragged along also. When they defeat Irenicus, they return to life and are honored by the elves of Suldanessellar.|$|E
