40|$|There is {{a medical}} team {{approach}} used in many hospitals for oral cancer patients. The members are head & neck <b>surgeons</b> and plastic <b>surgeons,</b> or oral <b>surgeons</b> and plastic <b>surgeons.</b> However, in Japan, {{it is very difficult}} for oral <b>surgeons</b> to cooperate with head & neck <b>surgeons,</b> except in the case of extractions and oral health care, because both <b>surgeons</b> treat oral carcinomas and there is therefore a conflict in their scope of practice. We believe it desirable for head & neck <b>surgeons</b> to treat oral cancer patients with tumors extending to other regions, and oral <b>surgeons</b> should be in charge of occlusion in head and neck carcinomas. We treated two patients with oral carcinomas in collaboration with head and neck <b>surgeons</b> and plastic <b>surgeons,</b> with head & neck <b>surgeons</b> resecting the tumors, plastic <b>surgeons</b> reconstructing, and oral <b>surgeons</b> (dentists) taking charge of the occlusion for patients in the operating room. This collaboration resulted in patients having good position of the temporomandibular joint and occlusions after the operation. We therefore conclude that this collaborative team approach may be of benefit to the patients...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The study {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} <b>surgeons</b> and emergency medicine physicians (EMPs) have differing opinions on trauma residency training and trauma management in clinical practice. Methods: A survey was mailed to 250 EMPs and 250 <b>surgeons</b> randomly selected. Results: Fifty percent of <b>surgeons</b> perceived that surgery exclusively managed trauma compared to 27 % of EMPs. <b>Surgeons</b> were more likely to feel that only <b>surgeons</b> should manage trauma on presentation to the ED. However, only 60 % of <b>surgeons</b> currently felt comfortable with caring for the trauma patient, compared to 84 % of EMPs. Compared to EMPs, <b>surgeons</b> are less likely to feel that EMPs can initially manage the trauma patient (71 % of <b>surgeons</b> vs. 92 % of EMPs). Conclusion: EMPs are comfortable managing trauma while many <b>surgeons</b> do not feel comfortable with the complex trauma patient although the majority of <b>surgeons</b> responded that <b>surgeons</b> should manage the trauma.

5000|$|The {{origins of}} the College date to the fourteenth century with the {{foundation}} of the [...] "Guild of <b>Surgeons</b> Within the City of London".

There was ongoing dispute between the <b>surgeons</b> and barber <b>surgeons</b> until an agreement was signed between them in 1493, giving the fellowship of <b>surgeons</b> the power of incorporation. [...] This union was formalised further in 1540 by Henry VIII between the Worshipful Company of Barbers (incorporated 1462) and the Guild of <b>Surgeons</b> to form the Company of Barber-Surgeons. In 1745 the <b>surgeons</b> broke away from the barbers to form the Company of <b>Surgeons.</b> In 1800 the Company was granted a Royal Charter to become the Royal College of <b>Surgeons</b> in London.
