40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of grapefruit juice and <b>seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice on dextromethorphan (DM) pharmacokinetics. Eleven healthy volunteers were studied over a 3 -week period consisting of 5 study days each separated by a three-day washout. All subjects refrained from drinking caffeine containing beverages (coffee, soda, etc.) 8 h before orally taking DM (30 mg) with 200 ml water, 200 ml grapefruit juice, 200 ml water, 200 ml <b>seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice, and 200 ml water on Study Days 1 to 5. Aliquots of urine samples were assayed and analysed for DM, and the DM metabolites dextrorphan, 3 -methoxymorphinan and 3 -hydroxymorphinan using a validated HPLC method employing a phenyl column and a fluorescence detection. Results suggests that DM could provide some useful information on P-glycoprotein or related membrane efflux protein activity in the human gastro-intestinal tract. Bioavailability (F) of DM increased significantly with grapefruit and <b>seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice, but only returned to half the baseline value after three days of washout. This confirms that grapefruit and <b>seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice are long-lasting and perhaps irreversible inhibitors of gut CYP 3 A/P-glycoprotein.

50|$|Imatinib (Gleevec): Although {{no formal}} studies with imatinib and {{grapefruit}} juice have been conducted, {{the fact that}} grapefruit juice is a known inhibitor of the CYP 3A4 suggests that co-administration may lead to increased imatinib plasma concentrations. Likewise, although no formal studies were conducted, co-administration of imatinib with another specific type of citrus juice called <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice (SOJ) may lead to increased imatinib plasma concentrations via inhibition of the CYP3A isoenzymes. <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice is not usually consumed as a juice because of its sour taste, but it is found in marmalade and other jams. <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice {{has been reported to}} be a possible inhibitor of CYP3A enzymes without affecting MDR1 when taken concomitantly with ciclosporin.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{labeling}} for colchicine (indicated for acute gout flares or prophylaxis) includes strict advisories regarding drug–drug and drug–food interactions, including warnings against consuming grapefruit or {{grapefruit juice}} during treatment. Two of the furocoumarins in grapefruit juice and <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice can inhibit intestinal cytochrome P 450 (CYP) isozyme 3 A 4 and P-glycoprotein (involved in colchicine metabolism and transport). Severe toxicities in patients consuming these juices while taking other drugs metabolized through these pathways have been reported. ObjectiveTwo Phase I studies assessed {{the effects of}} multiple daily consumptions of <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice or grapefruit juice on the pharmacokinetic properties of colchicine in healthy volunteers. MethodsHealthy volunteers were enrolled in 2 open-label, Phase I studies. Undiluted juice (240 mL) was administered twice daily for 4 days. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained following a single 0. 6 -mg dose of colchicine before the administration of juice and again following a single 0. 6 -mg dose of colchicine {{on the final day}} of juice administration. In each study, blood samples for pharmacokinetics were collected before dosing with colchicine and at 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose. All subjects were monitored for adverse events (AEs) throughout the confinement portion of the study and were queried at the outpatient visits. AEs were coded according to corresponding MedDRA-coded system organ classes. ResultsForty-four subjects received either grapefruit juice (72. 7 % male; 90. 9 % white) or <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice (62. 5 % female; 100 % white). Although it is considered to be a moderate concentration-dependent CYP 3 A 4 inhibitor, grapefruit juice did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic parameters of colchicine. When colchicine was administered with <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice, a moderate inhibitor, Cmax and AUC were decreased by ∼ 24 % and ∼ 20 %, respectively. <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice also caused, on average, a 1 -hour delay in Tmax. Colchicine in combination with grapefruit or <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice was well tolerated. There were no significant treatment-related AEs reported, and the most likely AEs were general gastrointestinal events. ConclusionsIn contrast to label warnings based on the literature, grapefruit juice did not affect the pharmacokinetics of colchicine. <b>Seville</b> <b>orange</b> juice paradoxically reduced absorption of colchicine and increased Tmax, but the clinical significance of this is unknown. Contrary to the expected effects of inhibiting the enzymes that metabolize colchicine, neither juice increased exposure to colchicine. However, the absence of a positive control in these studies dictates that caution should be used when applying these results clinically.
