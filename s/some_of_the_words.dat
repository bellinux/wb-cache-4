25|$|Translation {{has given}} rise to a number of issues, as the {{original}} languages are often quite different in grammar as well as word meaning. While the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy states that inerrancy applies only to the original languages, some believers trust their own translation to be the accurate one. One such group of believers is known as the King-James-Only Movement. For readability, clarity, or other reasons, translators may choose different wording or sentence structure, and some translations may choose to paraphrase passages. Because <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> in the original language have ambiguous or difficult to translate meanings, debates over the correct interpretation occur.|$|E

500|$|... "Used to Love You" [...] {{received}} praise, {{with many}} critics noting its lyrical content and Stefani's emotional delivery. Others appreciated it {{for being a}} heartbreaking song. Critics viewed the single as an improvement over her 2014 releases, which Stefani herself later described as [...] "rushed". Stefani first premiered the song during a concert on October 17, 2015 and its music video was released three days later. The music video is a single shot of Stefani on a black background, displaying her emotions, and occasionally mouthing <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of the song.

500|$|The song {{begins with}} [...] "a startling machine-gun fuzz guitar riff", with Lennon and Harrison's guitars {{prominent}} throughout the track. The distorted guitar sound {{was achieved by}} direct injection of the guitar signal into the mixing console. Emerick later explained that he routed the signal through two microphone preamplifiers in series while keeping the amount of overload just below the point of overheating the console. This was such a severe abuse of the studio equipment that Emerick thought, [...] "If I was the studio manager and saw this going on, I'd fire myself." [...] Lennon overdubbed the opening scream, and double-tracked <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> [...] "so roughly that its careless spontaneity becomes a point in itself", according to author Ian MacDonald.|$|E
500|$|When {{the monsters}} battle {{each other at}} the end of the episode, a Japanese man sings songs about each of the monsters while they approach. This mirrors a common element {{throughout}} actual Japanese monster movies, which commonly have theme songs for the monster characters. Parker wrote the songs in Japanese language. The English translation for the lyrics sung when Robert Smith transforms translates are, [...] "I really like Robert Smith", and the lyrics sung about Mecha-Streisand translate, [...] "Barbra, Barbra, she's a bitch, Barbra". When Streisand becomes Mecha-Streisand, the line was written in Japanese, [...] "From this moment on, I am Mecha-Streisand!", but Parker said Bergman misread <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> so the on-air translation was imperfect. Before Leonard Maltin transforms, he screams in Japanese, [...] "Listen, listen, here's a tulip", which Parker said is a phrase Japanese children say before passing gas.|$|E

The province of Saskatchewan derives its name from the Saskatchewan River, which in the Cree language is called [...] "Kisiskatchewani Sipi", meaning [...] "swift-flowing river." [...] Canada's capital city Ottawa comes from the Algonquin language term [...] "adawe" [...] meaning [...] "to trade."

500|$|It {{was always}} the same sort of system with us. We would write the nucleus of the song, the melody primary music, and then <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> were there as we {{finished}} writing it. I started playing some rock 'n' roll piano and started boogie woogie-ing my left hand, and that inspired Mariah {{to come up with the}} melodic [...] 'I don't want a lot for Christmas.' And then we started singing and playing around with this rock 'n' roll boogie song, which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being 'All I Want For Christmas Is You.' That one went very quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes. I tried to make it a little more unique, putting in some special chords that you really don't hear a lot of, which made it unique and special.|$|E
500|$|Stephanie McGrath of Jam! {{said the}} song is [...] "a nice break from the 'baby babys', 'yeah yeahs' and insistent drum beats that pepper the other songs" [...] of Oops!.

Spears considered it a [...] "pure and delicate" [...] song. [...] "It's just one of those songs that pull you in. That's why I like it, and I like singing it as well," [...] she continued. [...] "I think they wrote it 'specially for me, because the lyrics of the song, if you really listen... they're more of what I can relate to, 'cause they're kind of young lyrics, I think.

500|$|... "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" [...] is very {{commonly}} sung at England fixtures – {{especially at}} Twickenham.
