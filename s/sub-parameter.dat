Material: Thirty (N= 30) male inter-college level players with the age group of 19 - 25 years were selected through purposive sampling technique to act as subjects from affiliated colleges of Panjab University, Chandigarh. They were further divided into three groups: Group-A [Judo (n= 10) ], Group-B [Taekwondo (n= 10) ] and Group-C [Boxing (n= 10) ]. One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was applied to find out the differences among judo, taekwondo and boxing players. Where ‘F’ values found significant, Least Significant Differences (LSD) Post-hoc test was applied to find out the direction and degree of difference. Results: The level of significance was set at 0. 05. The result revealed significant differences among judo, taekwondo and boxing players on the sub parameters: clothing and appearance, preparation, team ritual and coach. However, no significant differences have been observed on the sub-parameters fetish, game/competition, prayer and parameter superstitious (Total). Conclusions: The obtained results showed significant differences on the <b>sub-parameter</b> Coach among Judo, Taekwondo and Boxing players. While calculating the mean values of entire groups, it has been observed that Boxing players demonstrate significantly better on the <b>sub-parameter</b> Coach. Therefore, it can be ascertained that Boxing players are more confident that coach bring a lucky charm to our game...|$|E

40|$|A {{structural}} approach for modelling a statistical problem permits {{to introduce a}} contextual theory based in previous knowledge. This approach makes the parameters completely meaningful; but, in the intermediate steps, some unobservable characteristics are introduced because of their contextual meaning. When the model is completely specified, the marginalisation into the observed variables is operated {{in order to obtain}} a tatistical model. The variables can be discrete or continuous both at the level of unobserved and at the level of observed or manifest variables. We are sometimes faced, especially in behavioural sciences, with ordinal variables; this is the case of the so-called Likert scales. Therefore, an ordinal variable could be nterpreted as a discrete version of a latent concept (the discretization model). The normality of the latent variables simplifies the study of this model into the analysis {{of the structure of the}} covariance matrix of the "ideally" measured variables, but only a <b>sub-parameter</b> of these matrix can be identified and consistently estimated (i. e. the matrix of polychoric correlations). Consequently, two questions rise here: Is the normality of the latent variables testable? If not, what is the aspect of this hypothesis which could be testable?. In the discretization model, we observe a loss of information with related to the information contained in the latent variables. In order to treat this situation we introduce the concept of partial observability through a (non bijective) measurable function of the latent variable. We explore this definition and verify that other models can be adjusted to this concept. The definition of partial observability permits us to distinguish between two cases depending on whether the involved function is or not depending on a Euclidean parameter. Once the partial observability is introduced, we expose a set of conditions for building a specification test at the level of latent variables. The test is built using the encompassing principle in a Bayesian framework. More precisely, the problem treated in this thesis is: How to test, in a Bayesian framework, the multivariate normality of a latent vector when only a discretized version of that vector is observed. More generally, the problem can be extended to (or re-paraphrased in) : How to test, in Bayesian framework, a parametric specification on latent variables against a nonparametric alternative when only a partial observation of these latent variables is available.

It is argued that the right invariant measure induced by the group on the parameter space is a natural non-informative prior for the parameters of the model. The permissible <b>sub-parameters</b> are introduced, i. e., the subparameters upon which group actions can be defined. Equivariant estimators are similarly defined. Orbits of the group are defined on the sample space and on the parameter space; in particular the group action is called transitive when there is only one orbit.

Catchment’s properties determine various <b>sub-parameters</b> that {{play an important role}} in the water budget within the catchment (Atkinson 2002). The intricate relationship between vegetation and water cycle in a micro-catchment defines the water cycle in the basin, which in turn redefines the growth and productivity of the plant species (Thakur et al. 2012; Li et al. 2013; UIZ 2015). Similarly, the nature of the soil and its spatial distribution also affect the basin’s response to water availability (Schmidt et al. 2011; Thakur 2011). However, this relationship has failed to be understood by many management interventions and planning policy needs.

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{testing for}} {{simultaneous}} divergence (vicariance) across different population-pairs that span the same barrier to gene flow is of central importance to evolutionary biology, researchers often equate the gene tree and population/species tree thereby ignoring stochastic coalescent variance in their conclusions of temporal incongruence. In contrast to other available phylogeographic software packages, msBayes {{is the only}} one that analyses data from multiple species/population pairs under a hierarchical model. Results msBayes employs approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) under a hierarchical coalescent model to test for simultaneous divergence (TSD) in multiple co-distributed population-pairs. Simultaneous isolation is tested by estimating three hyper-parameters that characterize the degree of variability in divergence times across co-distributed population pairs while allowing for variation in various within population-pair demographic parameters (<b>sub-parameters)</b> that can affect the coalescent. msBayes is a software package consisting of several C and R programs that are run with a Perl "front-end". Conclusion The method reasonably distinguishes simultaneous isolation from temporal incongruence in the divergence of co-distributed population pairs, even with sparse sampling of individuals. Because the estimate step is decoupled from the simulation step, one can rapidly evaluate different ABC acceptance/rejection conditions and the choice of summary statistics. Given the complex and idiosyncratic nature of testing multi-species biogeographic hypotheses, we envision msBayes as a powerful and flexible tool for tackling a wide array of difficult research questions that use population genetic data from multiple co-distributed species. The msBayes pipeline is available for download at [URL] under an open source license (GNU Public License). The msBayes pipeline is comprised of several C and R programs that are run with a Perl "front-end" and runs on Linux, Mac OS-X, and most POSIX systems. Although the current implementation is for a single locus per species-pair, future implementations will allow analysis of multi-loci data per species pair. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} comply with strict air {{emissions}} regulations, applicable diesel engines are required to have an installed after-treatment device. A diesel particulate filter (DPF) {{is one of these}} aftertreatment devices, and it is used to capture hazardous particulate matter (PM) from the engine exhaust stream. Over the lifetime of the DPF, incombustible materials like ash are deposited within the DPF. The presence of ash inhibits the exhaust flow and thus causes flow restriction throughout the filter. This increase in the flow restriction due to ash accumulation has an adverse effect on engine performance, primarily a reduction in fuel economy. While the global effects of ash on engine performance are well researched and understood, the fundamental mechanisms of ash phenomenology in the DPF require further understanding. Current experimental data mainly addresses how ash porosity and permeability influence pressure drop across the filter, but an investigation of these properties reveals how other key sub parameters, such as ash particle size and distribution and filter oxidation level, significantly contribute to an increase in pressure drop as well. The focus of this work is to understand the behavior of ash particles in a sintered metal fiber (SMF) filter substrate and recognize the resultant effect on DPF pressure drop using an advanced diagnostic approach. Much of the work relies on the use of sophisticated imaging and software tools to quantify properties such as particle size, particle distribution, filter porosity, and permeability among others. Additionally, this research introduces and demonstrates the capabilities of these cutting-edge tools and how they can best be utilized to provide filter performance data to qualify existing and future experimental data for SMF or cordierite filters.

40|$|Assessment {{of worker}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{exposure}} {{is becoming increasingly}} critical in the pharmaceutical industry as drugs of higher potency are being manufactured. Also the batch nature of operations often {{makes it difficult to}} obtain sufficient numbers of exposure measurements to adequately characterise exposure levels. This research aims to investigate the ability of two occupational exposure models to predict inhalable dust exposures in this industry and specifically to: refine and validate an existing deterministic source-receptor exposure model; and to refine, calibrate, validate and investigate the reliability of the inhalable dust exposure form of the newly developed Advanced REACH Tool (ART). A broad range of workplace exposure assessment data containing all the contextual information required for the exposure models was collated from a multinational pharmaceutical company. Within both exposure models, input parameters such as localised controls and handling activities, were refined to reflect pharmaceutical situations. The source-receptor model was validated and the relationship between model estimates and measured pharmaceutical data was investigated (n= 381 measurements). The inhalable dust exposure form of the ART was calibrated with a pharmaceutical dataset and linear mixed effects regression analysis was used to translate the relative model scores to quantitative exposure levels (in mg/m 3). The pharmaceutical dataset was also included in the generic dataset for the calibration of the inhalable dust model and results of both calibrations are compared to investigate the applicability of the generic model for pharmaceutical scenarios. As part of the validation of the generically calibrated ART, relative bias and uncertainty around geometric mean exposure estimates were calculated for 16 pharmaceutical exposure scenarios (n= 192 measurements). To investigate the reliability of the online ART, 18 health and safety professionals assessed four exposure scenarios representative of the industry; information and a demonstration of the ART were provided at two stages during the one-day workshop. Inter-rater agreement was investigated and also the participantsÂ¿ assessment per determinant and their ART exposure estimates were compared with the corresponding gold-standard assessments.

40|$|Introduction Carbon {{sequestration}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important approaches to reduce CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere. Increase of CO 2 in the atmosphere has prompted renewed interest in increasing the stocks of carbon (C) in the world’s croplands to mitigate climate change and also improve soil quality IPCC (2000). To better characterize, predict and manage soil C dynamics, more precise and accurate estimates of C inputs to the soil is required. The C fixed in plants by photosynthesis and added to the soil as above- and below-ground litter, is the primary source of C in ecosystems (Warembourg & Paul, 1977). Predicting the changes in C stocks (notably in soils), therefore, depends on reliable estimates of net primary productivity (NPP) and the proportion of the NPP returned to the soil (Paustian et al., 1997). The annual NPP in agroecosystems, and the distribution of C in plant parts, is usually calculated from agricultural yield, the plant component most often measured. For carbon sequestration estimation, it is necessary to evaluate the effects of management practices on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in a wide range of production systems and climatic zones. Soil organic carbon is essential for maintaining fertility, water retention, and plant production in terrestrial ecosystems. The amount of SOC stored within an ecosystem, dependes on the quantity and quality of organic matter returned to the soil matrix, the soils ability to retain organic carbon (a function of texture and cation exchange capacity), and biotic influences of both temperature and precipitation. The abiotic influences on SOC dynamics, such as moisture, temperature, aeration and the composition of plant residues are reasonably well understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the amount of carbon sequestration by agor-ecosystems and also the amount of CO 2 emitted from agro-ecosystems in Iran. Material and methods The amount of carbon input for seven main crops including cereal (wheat, barley, rice and maize), forage crops (alfalfa), industrial crops (cotton) and legume (chickpea) were calculated in different climate types of Iran and finally, the amount of carbon sequestration and CO 2 emission for different crops were estimated. Plant C allometric functions developed for the crops together with The Introductory C Balance Model (ICBM; Andrén and Kätterer, 1997) to describe SOC dynamics for the cropping systems were employed in this study. The model has two compartments, called Young and Old soil C, and five parameters: i, re, h, kY and kO. Annual inputs of soil C to topsoil from crop and manure are summarized in i. The parameter re (decomposer activity factor, see above) is multiplied by kY and kO, respectively, to determine the actual decomposition rates of the young and old pools for a given year. Parameter h, the humification coefficient, determines the fraction of the input that goes through Young and into Old (humus, or refractory component), and is about 0. 1 for most agricultural crops and about 0. 3 for manure. Then we adapted the ICBM soil climate and decomposer activity parameter (re) to account for the major effects of managing and climatically parameters. The re parameter usually is calculated from <b>sub-parameters</b> based on climate, soil type, crop type, intensity of cultivation and so on.

40|$|Global {{offshore}} {{oil and gas}} (OOG) production is rapidly expanding to meet increasing energy demands. Since the offshore environment is sensitive, attention is increasingly devoted to environmental issues associated with OOG operations. An Environmental Management System (EMS) can be utilized to systematically manage all activities in OOG operations {{that give rise to}} environmental impacts. However, there is limited literature related to EMSs for OOG operations. This requires academics to examine common EMS frameworks and propose an EMS exclusively for OOG operations. This research was carried out to fill this gap. [...] common EMS frameworks have the following limitations: (1) they are not very effective to convey and interpret sufficient information for decision-making; (2) there is no specified performance evaluation system to drive improvement; and (3) there is a burden of extensive documentation. Therefore, it is necessary to revise conventional EMS frameworks to overcome these limitations. The main aim {{of this study is to}} integrate Risk-Informed Decision-Making (RIDM) and Pollution Prevention (P 2) paradigms within EMS, called Risk and Pollution Prevention focused Environmental Management System (RP 2 EMS). This framework also addresses the limitations of common EMS frameworks. Moreover, quantitative tools are developed to implement the proposed framework. The specific objectives of this research are: (1) development of an EMS framework; (2) development of a methodology to prioritize environmental issues; (3) development of a methodology for informed environmental decision-making; (4) development of a methodology for environmental performance evaluation; and (5) demonstration of developed methodologies through illustrative examples related to OOG operations. [...] As a preferred approach for environmental protection, P 2 is integrated into the conventional EMS framework. The risk informed decision-making is coupled with P 2 in this framework. This integration can reduce the effort and costs that are needed to develop waste management systems. As the first step, pollution prevention and control options are identified for important environmental issues. For each option, a risk assessment is carried out. Based on the calculated risks and related attributes, the better options are selected using a suitable decision-making method. Implementation of the selected options requires the proper assignment of responsibility and good communication during operations. The framework provides guidance and a procedure for the execution of environmental management emphasizing P 2. [...] Identification and prioritization of the important environmental issues which are susceptible to causing significant negative impacts are necessary under the constraint of limited resources. This study proposes a hybrid approach using the fuzzy inference system (FIS) and fuzzy AHP for the prioritization of environmental issues in OOG operations. In this approach, a five-level hierarchy is developed. The highest level of the hierarchy corresponds to the goal - prioritization of the significance of environmental issues, and the lowest level corresponds to environmental issues, whereas intermediate levels correspond to major concerns (environmental risks) and <b>sub-parameters</b> of risk. The FIS is applied at the lower levels of the hierarchy to infer the major risk parameters. Subsequently, the scores representing the extent of risk are calculated. Fuzzy AHP is used at the higher levels to synthesize the Significance Scores that will help to prioritize environmental issues. [...] To deal with the significant environmental issues, pollution prevention and other sustainable waste management options are investigated. The best options are selected using multi-criteria decision-making. This research proposes a game theoretical approach to solve multi-criteria conflict resolution problem under constrained and uncertain environments. Uncertainties in the quantification of imprecise data are expressed using rough numbers. A multi-criteria game is developed to model a decision problem in which three groups of decision-makers (i. e., operators, regulators and service engineers) are involved. There are three major categories of criteria: (1) costs, (2) environmental risks, and (3) technical feasibility. This game is solved using the generalized maximin solution concept. With the solution (i. e., optimal weights of the criteria), the rough numbers can be aggregated to an expected payoff for each alternative. Finally, the weights of the upper and lower limits of a rough number are employed to transform the expected payoff into a crisp score, based on which all alternatives are ranked to identify the best solution. [...] Environmental performance evaluation (EPE) is an essential part of EMS. A method is developed to identify and define specific environmental performance indicators on a case-by-base basis, which consists of five steps: (1) describing environmental requirements; (2) determining favorable outcomes corresponding to the requirements; (3) identifying required activities of issues to achieve the outcomes; (4) searching for proper measures of the activities or issues; and (5) generating a list of key indicators. Based on these steps, a quality function deployment (QFD) approach is developed to determine key indicators and evaluate environmental performance. To handle uncertainties in QFD, the decision makers’ evaluations are quantified using rough numbers. The output of the proposed approach is environmental performance indices. Using these indices, decision makers can determine whether an improved performance has been achieved through an EMS. [...] This research provides an innovative EMS framework that integrates paradigms of P 2 and risk-informed decision-making to systematically manage environmental issues in OOG operations. All the proposed approaches were validated through numerical examples...|$|R
