30|$|To {{address the}} {{planning}} issue of <b>offshore</b> <b>oilfield</b> power systems, an integrated generation-transmission expansion planning model is proposed. The outage cost is considered and the genetic Tabu hybrid algorithm (GTHA) is developed {{to find the}} optimal solution. With the proposed integrated model, the planning of generators and transmission lines can be worked out simultaneously, which outweighs the disadvantages of separate planning, for instance, unable to consider the influence of power grid during the planning of generation, or insufficient to plan the transmission system without enough information of generation. The integrated planning model takes into account both the outage cost and the shipping cost, which makes the model more practical for <b>offshore</b> <b>oilfield</b> power systems. The planning problem formulated based on the proposed model is a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem of very high computational complexity, which is difficult to solve by regular mathematical methods. A comprehensive optimization method based on GTHA is also developed to search the best solution efficiently. Finally, a case study on the planning of a 50 -bus <b>offshore</b> <b>oilfield</b> power system is conducted, and the obtained results fully demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} presented model and method.|$|R

30|$|However, the {{composite}} generation and transmission system expansion planning is reasonable for <b>offshore</b> <b>oilfield</b> power systems. Three reasons are explained for this idea. First, offshore systems are {{much smaller than}} inland systems and have far fewer stations and lines to be planned, which means the number of decision variables is much smaller. Second, both generation and transmission system are constructed and operated by a single company (In China, the company is China National Offshore Oil Corporation). As a result, simultaneous and integrated planning of generation and transmission is feasible in the perspectives of both technology and management. Last but not least, the investment cost of submarine cables is enormous enough to be {{comparable to that of}} generators. Consequently, separate execution of TEP and GEP could lead to ill-considered decisions. Overall, integrated planning is not only feasible but also necessary for <b>offshore</b> <b>oilfield</b> power systems [23]. Furthermore, special attention should be paid to two issues for the planning of offshore systems. One is the outage cost, which need be taken into account for the fact that loss of electricity in the <b>offshore</b> <b>oilfield</b> would cause serious damage to drilling equipment or even a complete halt of oil production. The other is the shipping cost, which should be explicitly considered for the reason that the distance from the mainland to offshore platforms is critical for determining the construction costs of generators and cables.|$|R

30|$|Reduction {{in water}} {{injectivity}} would {{be harmful to}} the waterflood development of offshore sandstone oil reservoirs. In this paper the magnitude of formation damage during water injection was evaluated by analyzing the performance of water injection in the Bohai <b>offshore</b> <b>oilfield,</b> China. Two parameters, permeability reduction and rate of wellhead pressure rise, were proposed to evaluate the formation damage around injection wells. The pressure performance curve could be divided into three stages with different characteristics. Analysis of field data shows that formation damage caused by water injection was severe in some wells in the Bohai <b>offshore</b> <b>oilfield,</b> China. In the laboratory, the content of clay minerals in reservoir rock was analyzed and sensitivity tests (including sensitivity to water, flow rate, alkali, salt and acid) were also conducted. Experimental {{results show that the}} reservoir had a strong to medium sensitivity to water (i.e. clay swelling) and a strong to medium sensitivity to flow rate, which may cause formation damage. For formation damage prevention, three injection schemes of clay stabilizer (CS) were studied, i.e. continuous injection of low concentration CS (CI), slug injection of high concentration CS (SI), and slug injection of high concentration CS followed by continuous injection of low concentration CS (SI-CI). Core flooding experiments show that SI-CI is an effective scheme to prevent formation damage and is recommended for the sandstone oil reservoirs in the Bohai <b>offshore</b> <b>oilfield</b> during water injection.|$|R

30|$|Offshore oil {{resource}} is playing an increasingly {{significant role in}} satisfying our fossil fuel needs. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, in 2014, about 47 % of the total untapped oil resource comes from the sea [1]. For the offshore oil industry, it is becoming an important issue to reliably supply electrical power to the offshore oil platforms. At present, most of the oil platforms far from the land are powered by the independent power stations built on them. This power supply mode, however, would lead to blackout of the platform once the power station thereon shuts down [2]. Therefore, it becomes a trend to construct <b>offshore</b> <b>oilfield</b> power systems that can interconnect every platform to improve the reliability of power supply [3]. Since 2010, offshore platforms have been connected electrically {{along the coast of}} China. Many larger-scale offshore power systems are emerging. Therefore, how to plan a highly reliable power system suitable for the <b>offshore</b> <b>oilfield</b> is critical for the construction as well as the effective and safe operation of the offshore oil industry.|$|R
30|$|Field {{experience}} has proven that polymer flooding {{can be an}} effective means to improve oil recovery after water flooding. Polymer flooding plays the role by adding water-soluble polymer in injection water to increase the injection viscosity (Needham and Doe 1987; Kaminsky et al. 2007). The reason why polymer flooding can enhance oil recovery relies on that it can improve areal and vertical sweep efficiency as well as providing mobility control (Gogarty 1978; Davison and Mentzer 1982; Wang et al. 2002; Wang and Liu 2004). As an important enhanced oil recovery technique, polymer flooding is currently widely used in China’s onshore oilfields. For example, the world’s largest polymer flooding was implemented at Daqing Oilfield, beginning in 1996. By 2007, 22.3  % of total production from the Daqing Oil Field was attributed to polymer flooding (Dong et al. 2008). Polymer flooding, which is also widely used in <b>offshore</b> <b>oilfields</b> in China, has become an important enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique recently for <b>offshore</b> <b>oilfields</b> development (Ming et al. 2006; Wei et al. 2007; 2008).|$|R
