40|$|Carotenoids {{are used}} in animal {{nutrition}} mainly as <b>sensory</b> <b>additives</b> that favourably affect the colour of fish, birds and food of animal origin. Various analytical methods exist for their quantification in compound feed, reflecting the different physico-chemical characteristics of the carotenoid and the corresponding feed additives. They may be natural products or specific formulations containing the target carotenoids produced by chemical synthesis. In this study a multi-analyte method was developed {{that can be applied}} to the determination of all 10 carotenoids currently authorised within the European Union for compound feedingstuffs. The method functions regardless of whether the carotenoids have been added to the compound feed via natural products or specific formulations. It is comprised of three steps: (1) digestion of the feed sample with an enzyme; (2) pressurised liquid extraction; and (3) quantification of the analytes by reversed-phase HPLC coupled to a photodiode array detector in the visible range. The method was single-laboratory validated for poultry and fish feed covering a mass fraction range of the target analyte from 2. 5 to 300 mg kg– 1. The following method performance characteristics were obtained: the recovery rate varied from 82 % to 129 % and precision expressed as the relative standard deviation of intermediate precision varied from 1. 6 % to 15 %. Based on the acceptable performance obtained in the validation study, the multi-analyte method is considered fit for the intended purpose. JRC. F. 5 -Food and Feed Complianc...|$|E
40|$|When {{exposed to}} a novel diet during food transition, pigs often {{decrease}} voluntarily their food intake, {{which can lead to}} impaired growth. The aim {{of the present study was}} to test the palatability of eight unknown food additives (mixture of various essential oils and other plant extracts) and to identify among them the additives that were likely to improve food preferences, intake and weight gain in juvenile pigs. In Experiment 1, 12 juvenile female pigs were subjected to one- and two-way choice tests to investigate their spontaneous preferences between a standard grower diet and nine experimental diets composed of the familiar grower diet added with the sensory functional ingredients (N 1 –N 8) at predefined concentrations. As the control diet was preferred over the N 5, N 6, N 7 and N 8 diets, only the N 1, N 2, N 3 and N 4 additives were selected for Experiment 2. In Experiment 2, 12 juvenile female pigs were subjected to two-choice feeding tests to investigate their relative preferences between the four remaining experimental diets. Overall, the analysis of individual and collective consumption and preferences suggests that some additives might be more palatable than others, at the tested concentrations, and that preferences are subjected to a great inter-individual variability. Experiment 2 enabled to identify the N 1 and N 3 additives as the best candidates for Experiment 3. In Experiment 3, the spontaneous food intake of 24 juvenile female pigs was assessed during a food transition. After nine days during which they were fed a familiar starter diet, the pigs were divided into three experimental groups and fed an unfamiliar grower diet added with either the N 1 additive, the N 3 additive, or with no additive (control). Albeit the adjunction of the functional ingredients in the novel diet did not increase food intake or weight gain in these particular experimental conditions, it might enable to maintain a normal consumption the day of the food transition, contrary to the control diet, although the results were not significant. Further studies using complementary tests where a unique food is provided in controlled conditions, in addition to two-choice tests, might enable to investigate more accurately the efficiency of the <b>sensory</b> <b>additives</b> to improve food palatability, preferences and intake in pigs...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Many herbal {{products}} (herbs {{and essential}} oils) are currently used as feed additives by the feed {{industry in the}} European Union and elsewhere. These phytogenic substances which increase feed aroma or palatability of feeds are classified as <b>sensory</b> <b>additives</b> by European Council. However, several publications show that some essential oils may have beneficial effects on animal performance and health status because of other properties except their sensory characteristics. These claimed properties are stimulation of digestive secretions; antimicrobial, coccidiostat, anthelmintic, and anti-inflammatory activities; and antioxidant properties. Most research revealed that supplementing herbal essential oils to diets resulted in reducing blood cholesterol, increasing palatability of feed and stimulating the immune system in poultry, while different results obtained by ruminants because of rumen microbial population and ruminal fermentation conditions. The use of large and repeated quantities of antibiotics in animal feed may cause to eliminate beneficial intestinal microflora and innate immune system and subsequently cause to antibiotic resistance and remains antibiotics in animal products. Recently, many herbal products because having flavoring and antimicrobial properties as introduced as good alternatives for antibiotics. The aim of the present investigation was to study of effect of Ziziphora clinopodioies, Mentha spicata and Mentha pulegium {{on the performance of}} suckling calves, dry matter digestibility, blood parameters and the immune system, the effect on the incidence of diarrhea and fecal microbial population (Escherichia coli, lactobacillus and total aerobic bacteria). Materials and Methods In the present study, extraction of essential oils from three plant species (Ziziphora clinopodioies, Mentha spicata and Mentha pulegium) by means of gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) were analyzed. In order to determine the chemical composition of plants used for food such as dry matter, crude protein and ether extracts, from conventional laboratory methods AOAC (2005) were used. sixteen Holstein calves with mean of 42. 18 ± 0. 71 Kg birth weight, aged 5 ± 3 day allocated to treats: 1) control (milk without additive), 2) milk contains powder Ziziphora clinipodioides, 3) milk contains powder Mentha spicata, 4) milk contains powder Mentha pulegium. The herbs added to milk in each treatment was 20 g daily. Duration the experimental period was 25 days. Dry matter intake, water intake and fecal score measured daily. Body weight monitored every 5 days, and blood sampling conducted twice, once one day {{before the start of the}} period (day zero) and once final day. Samples for culture prepared in three phases beginning, middle and end of the period. Results and Discussion The major component in Ziziphora clinopodioies was pulegone (38. 34...|$|E

40|$|Organic {{processing}} standards already prohibit {{the use of}} many chemicals, additives and preservatives, which {{are used in the}} processing of conventional foods. Yet, there are frequent discussions of the underlying principles on organic food processing regarding such aspects as environmentally friendly processing, minimal use of <b>additives,</b> <b>sensory</b> quality, and transportation. It is therefore essential to develop a framework or code of practice, which can be used to determine whether novel processing strategies are compatible with organic {{processing standards}} and principles as well as consumer demands and expectations in relation to quality characteristics of processed food. In the present subproject part of the research comprised an assessment of alternative sanitising protocols under controlled laboratory conditions in the processing of fresh cut lettuce and mixtures of fresh-cut-vegetables. During these studies it was found that, with regard to ecological aspects, ozone is a good alternative to the existing disinfectants, such as chlorine, in the organic field.

40|$|The wheat-based {{foods that}} can be {{considered}} daily consumer to any person may be a health threat to others, because they contain a component called gluten, which the celiacs are intolerant. Being cassava a traditional crop in Ecuador without gluten and given the necessity of the proposed situation, the present investigation develops a powder base from the mixture of flours of cassava, rice and maize, which replaced the flour wheat in the formulations of products like muffins and sweet biscuits. To achieve this, the process of obtaining and characterization of cassava flour were developed. Then, the powder base was produced from the three flour mixture and determined its shelf life. Then, two formulations were determined to cookies and muffins, using two additives texture improvers: SSL (Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate) and DATEM (Diacetyl tartaric acid esters of monoglycerides).

40|$|INTRODUCTION This {{graduation}} theses considers {{with the}} influence of rehabilitation by electrotactile stimulation of the tongue on stability of stance and gait in patients with degenerative cerebellar ataxia. Electrotactile stimulation of the tongue is an innovative method based on biofeedback principle, which uses <b>additive</b> <b>sensory</b> information about {{the position of the}} head to train the postural stability METHOD We used this method in six patients (four men and two women) with this disease. Patients went through intensive twelve-day therapy. The duration of the lessons was 30 minutes twice a day. We examined postural stability of the patients by using clinical evaluations (Balance Evaluation Systems Test, Dynamic Gait Index), posturography (modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction for Balance) and questionnaires (Activities -specific Balance Confidence, Dizziness Handicap Inventory) before and after the therapy. RESULTS The patients showed significant improvement in both clinical tests after the therapy. The results of posturography measurement are not so definite - the significant improvement was achieved only in some measured parameters. Both questionnaires did not show significant improvement. CONCLUSION The results of this study show, that electrotactile stimulation tongue could have a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|It has {{recently}} been demonstrated that there are independent sensory and motor mechanisms underlying inhibition of return (IOR) when measured with oculomotor responses (Wang et al. in Exp Brain Res 218 : 441 - 453, 2012). However, these results are seemingly in conflict with previous empirical results {{which led to the}} proposal that there are two mutually exclusive flavors of IOR (Taylor and Klein in J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform 26 : 1639 - 1656, 2000). The observed differences in empirical results across these studies and the theoretical frameworks that were proposed based on the results are likely due to differences in the experimental designs. The current experiments establish that the existence of <b>additive</b> <b>sensory</b> and motor contributions to IOR do not depend on target type, repeated spatiotopic stimulation, attentional control settings, or a temporal gap between fixation offset and cue onset, when measured with saccadic responses. Furthermore, our experiments show that the motor mechanism proposed by Wang et al. in Exp Brain Res 218 : 441 - 453, (2012) is likely restricted to the oculomotor system, since the additivity effect does not carry over into the manual response modality. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Our study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} feed supplementation, from weaning, with 3 <b>sensory</b> feed <b>additives</b> (FA 1, FA 2, and FA 3) on feed preferences, feed intake, and growth of piglets. The FA 1 contained extract of Stevia rebaudiana (10 to 20 %), extract of high-saponin plants (5 to 10 %), and excipients (70 to 85 %), the FA 2 was mainly composed of a natural extract of Citrus sinensis (60 to 80 %), and the FA 3 was made of a blend of extracts of hot-flavored spices (5 to 15 %) and excipients (85 to 95 %). At weaning (d 1), a total of 32 female piglets housed in individual pens were allocated to 4 treatments (FA 1, FA 2, FA 3, and control [CON]) of equivalent mean weight. The pigs were fed a standard pelleted prestarter diet from weaning (d 1) to d 15 and a starter diet from d 16 to 28. The diets were supplemented with the feed additives (FA) corresponding to their treatment, while the CON treatment was the standard diets with no additive. Feed refusals were weighed daily and piglets were weighed weekly on d 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28. On the day of feed transition (d 16) as well as 7 (d 23) and 10 d (d 26) later, the animals were consecutively subjected to 1 - and 22 -h double-choice feeding tests to investigate their preferences during a short period and {{a longer period of}} time for the CON starter diet and the starter diet added with the FA corresponding to their treatment. No overall effect of the feed additives was observed on ADFI, ADG, G:F, and final BW. No overall preference was highlighted for the FA 1 treatment, except for a preference for the FA 1 starter diet during the 1 -h test on d 23 (78 % of total feed intake; P < 0. 01). For the FA 2 treatment, the pigs consumed the FA 2 starter diet more than the CON starter diet during the 22 -h tests on d 16 (67 % of total feed intake; P < 0. 05) and 26 (62 % of total feed intake; P < 0. 01). For the FA 3 treatment, on d 26, the FA 3 starter diet was and tended to be consumed more than the CON starter diet during 1 - (69 % of total intake; P < 0. 05) and 22 -h (60 % of total intake; P < 0. 10) tests, respectively. In conclusion, feed supplementation with the FA 1, FA 2, and FA 3 from weaning did not induce beneficial effects on feed intake and growth performance during the early postweaning period. The FA 2 increased palatability and acceptance of the unfamiliar starter diet the day of feed transition, while the FA 1 and FA 3 increased palatability of the starter diet only after a few days of exposure, most likely through long-term familiarization processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensorimotor}} {{control system}} is a complicated {{system in which the}} neural controller uses the feedback information from sensory modalities (visual, proprioceptive, vestibular, auditory, etc.) to actuate the musculo-skeletal system in order to execute intended movements. It has been an ongoing research to decode this sensorimotor integration. The current study utilized a systems identification approach in conjunction with a one-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulandum to quantify (delays, noises, wrist dynamics and controller parameters) a simplified (linear time-invariant) model of sensorimotor control for visually guided wrist stabilization movements. Four sensorimotor tasks were used to characterize the parameters of the sensorimotor control model. Open loop visual and proprioceptive delays along with effective feedforward delay (associated with motor processing and feedforward conduction) were estimated from subject 2 ̆ 7 s response to perturbation (Exp. 1) using cross-correlation analysis. Multiplicative feedforward (motor) noise was estimated by measuring the force variability in isometric torque contractions at 5 different torque levels (Exp. 2). Frequency response analysis (Exp. 3 and 4) was used to obtain estimates of wrist dynamics (inertia, viscosity and stiffness), the feedback (visual and proprioceptive) gains, the controller gains (proportional, integral and derivative) and an <b>additive</b> <b>sensory</b> noise. The experimental paradigms were validated by simulating and testing the experimental task along with the sensorimotor control model in SIMULINK®. The ability of the experiments to characterize the model was tested over a range of parameter values to determine the robustness of the approach. Model performance was measured by characterizing the sensorimotor control system in 11 subjects. Variance Accounted For (VAF) by the model was used as a performance metric to compare model 2 ̆ 7 s response (obtained using the parameters measured for each subject in the model) with subject 2 ̆ 7 s performance (Exp. 5). The proposed model of sensorimotor control contained 13 parameters, which were measured successively to study their interaction during wrist stabilization in 11 neurologically-intact subjects. The model parameters estimated for human subjects resulted in accurate predictions of hand position, with a high percentage of variance accounted for (VAF) across all subjects (78. 3 ± 3. 3...|$|R
