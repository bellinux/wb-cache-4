50|$|In the NLCS, the Cubs easily won {{the first}} two games at Wrigley Field against the San Diego Padres. The Padres were the winners of the Western Division with Steve Garvey, Tony Gwynn, Eric <b>Show,</b> <b>Goose</b> Gossage and Alan Wiggins. With wins of 13-0 and 4-2, the Cubs needed to win only one game of the next three in San Diego {{to make it to the}} World Series. After being beaten in Game 3 7-1, the Cubs lost Game 4 when Smith, with the game tied 5-5, allowed a game-winning home run to Garvey in the bottom of the ninth inning. In Game 5 the Cubs took a 3-0 lead into the 6th inning, and a 3-2 lead into the seventh with Sutcliffe (who won the Cy Young Award that year) still on the mound. Then, Leon Durham had a sharp {{grounder}} go under his glove. This critical error helped the Padres win the game 6-3, with a 4-run 7th inning and keep Chicago out of the 1984 World Series against the Detroit Tigers. The loss ended a spectacular season for the Cubs, one that brought alive a slumbering franchise and made the Cubs relevant for a whole new generation of Cubs fans.|$|E

40|$|According to {{the green}} wave concept, {{barnacle}} geese migrate north {{in an attempt to}} benefit from an extended spring.

In natural systems vegetation quality usually decreases when biomass accumulates, but in our experiment we successfully broke this link.

Non-lethal and humane means {{are needed for}} managing the size of Canada goose flocks residing near or on airports, golf courses, industrial parks, government sites, and city parks. A side effect of nicarbazin, a veterinary drug used to control coccidiosis in chickens, is decreased egg production and hatching. Exploiting this side effect, studies of nicarbazin for reducing the hatchability of eggs from Canada geese were conducted. An initial study in Coturnix quail verified reduction in hatchability in a species other than chickens. Because plasma nicarbazin was not routinely measured, a study in chickens was conducted to determine the relationship between plasma and egg nicarbazin. A comparative study in chickens, mallards, and Canada <b>geese</b> <b>showed</b> that nicarbazin absorption was lowest in geese. Studies in both penned and wild Canada <b>geese</b> <b>showed</b> that reduction in hatchability was possible but neither study used bait suitable for general field application. Bait development led to the OvoControl-G® (Innolytics LLC) bait, which resulted in reduction in hatchability of 51 % at treated sites compared to control sites in the field. Previous studies showed that nicarbazin is practically non-toxic and is environmentally friendly; timing and management of baiting will minimize non-target hazards. OvoControl-G® 2500 ppm nicarbazin bait is recommended for incorporation into a comprehensive management plan as a reproductive inhibitor for use in controlling resident Canada goose flock sizes...|$|R

40|$|Low {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} virus can mutate {{to a highly}} pathogenic strain that causes severe clinical signs in birds and humans. Migratory waterfowl, especially ducks, are considered the main hosts of low pathogenic avian influenza virus, but the role of geese in dispersing the virus over long-distances is still unclear. We collected throat and cloaca samples from three goose species, Bean goose (Anser fabalis), Barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) and Greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons), from their breeding grounds, spring stopover sites, and wintering grounds. We tested if the geese were infected with low pathogenic avian influenza virus outside of their wintering grounds, and analysed the spatial and temporal patterns of infection prevalence on their wintering grounds. Our results <b>show</b> that <b>geese</b> were not infected before their arrival on wintering grounds. Barnacle geese and Greater white-fronted geese had low prevalence of infection just after their arrival on wintering grounds in the Netherlands, but the prevalence increased in successive months, and peaked after December.

40|$|The {{change in}} {{agricultural}} regimes {{and thereby the}} increased grass growth, combined with the demise in goose and fox hunting have caused the Netherlands to become a prime goose paradise. By extending their arctic breeding locations to more temperate latitudes such as the Dutch Delta the geese have increased their summer staging and breeding areas.

As all growing wildlife populations the geese population causes conflicts with farmers who see their crop being consumed by all these geese. Crop damage is compensated by the government through the taxpayers. In this article {{we focus on the}} methods which can be used in goose management and their efficiency in population control.

40|$|Studies in the Canadian Arctic show {{dramatic}} {{effects of}} increased goose grazing on vegetation structure and soil conditions, but {{little is known}} {{of the role of}} goose grazing in the European Arctic. We focused on how geese might affect plant recruitment via effects on seed production and soil seed bank in High Arctic Svalbard. Experimental grazing by captive Barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis (Bechstein, 1803)) decreased flower densities both at normal and at high grazing pressure. Geese showed a clear preference for reproductive rather than vegetative shoots. Soil samples collected inside and outside 7 -year-old exclosures in an intensively goose-grazed area revealed significant effects on the germinable soil seed bank. The density of viable seeds in the top soil layer inside exclosures was six times higher than in grazed plots. Lower densities of viable seeds occurred in the basal than in the top layer but {{there was no difference in}} basal layer seed density between exclosed and grazed plots. This study <b>shows</b> that <b>geese</b> have strong effects on floral abundance and consequently on the seed bank. We argue that goose grazing in these systems influences the potential for recovery after a disturbance event and thus the long-term plant species diversity and dynamics. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{pink-footed goose}} () {{wintering}} in Denmark, The Netherlands and Belgium, {{the proportion of}} juveniles in the hunting bag is consistently higher than that observed in the autumn population. Such juvenile bias in the bag is usually ascribed to young geese lacking experience with hunting or disruption of juveniles from families. An alternative explanation may be that flocking behaviour of families make juveniles more vulnerable. Observations of morning flights of pink-footed geese to the feeding grounds from two of the major autumn-staging areas <b>showed</b> that <b>geese</b> were distributed in many small flocks (median flock size[*]=[*] 9). This was {{not significantly different from}} the flock size distribution shot at by hunters (median[*]=[*] 8), suggesting that hunters targeted goose flock size in proportion to the general probability of encounter. The rate at which hunters downed geese was independent of flock size. The ratio between juveniles and adults in flocks decreased with flock size and flocks of < 60 individuals primarily comprised family groups. The likelihood of being shot at was 2. 4 times higher for juveniles and 3. 4 times higher for older birds in small flocks (< 10 individuals) compared to larger flocks. The observations suggest that both juveniles as well as successful adult breeding birds were more vulnerable than non-breeding/failed breeding birds as a result of flocking behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Few studies address food {{preference}} of geese on agricultural land (utilization related to availability) {{and only a}} handful so for the breeding season. We studied Greylag geese Anser anser during the breeding season in an intensively farmed area in southern Sweden. Few of 22 available field types were truly preferred. Pastureland was the most consistently preferred, by goslings (with parents) {{as well as by}} nonbreeders. In some sampling periods, goslings also preferred grazed hay, ley, and carrot fields. Non-breeders exploited a greater variety of crops/fields, feeding also on barley, fallow, grazed hay, lettuce, oats, potatoes, and carrots. Most of these crops were preferred on at least one sampling occasion, except for fallow, grazed hay, and wheat, which were always used less than expected from availability. GLMs revealed that goslings rested more than they fed and preferred shorter vegetation before higher. Moreover, goslings occurred in higher densities in younger age classes than in older and preferred nearshore areas. In contrast, density of non-breeders was only related to field type and sampling occasion (higher densities as the season progressed). The maximum number of broods observed (106) implies a breeding success of 34 % based on 311 active nests earlier in the season. Brood size decreased from 3. 5 to 2. 1 during the study period.
