40|$|The BAHA (bone-anchored hearing aid) is a bone {{conduction}} hearing aid with percutaneous {{transmission of sound}} vibrations to the skull. The device has been thoroughly evaluated by various implant groups. These studies showed that, in audiological terms, the BAHA is superior to conventional {{bone conduction}} devices. In comparison with air conduction devices, the results are ambiguous. However, a positive effect is found with respect to aural discharge. The most powerful BAHA {{can be applied to}} patients with a sensorineural hearing loss component of up to 60 dB HL. It was shown that bilateral BAHA application leads to binaural sound processing. Preliminary results on the application of the BAHA in patients with unilateral conductive hearing loss suggest that <b>stereophonic</b> <b>hearing</b> can be re-established. The application of the BAHA as a transcranial CROS (contralateral routing of signal) device in unilateral deafness minimizes head shadow effects...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{contains}} a short introduction which describes {{the significance of}} music for human psyche. The focus is further placed on the research {{of the influence of}} Mozart?s compositions on students and children. The following chapter brings a concise characterisation of musical imagination, its subtypes and the heightened level of this imagination in musicians. The author is also concerned with the issues of musical aptitude, its basic characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of musical talent and the comparison between the brains of musicians and people of other professions. In the following chapters, the author focuses on the terms absolute pitch and synaesthesia, explicating their meaning, describing their specific features and analysing conditions of their origin as well as possible reasons for their future deterioration. The thesis also addresses the issue of potentially negative influences of music on human psyche, i. e. catchiness of some melodies and musical hallucinations, as well as the issue of dystonia in musicians, its causes and possible methods of treatment. The following chapters describe the effect of the so-called ?phantom hand?, the principle of <b>stereophonic</b> <b>hearing</b> and the consequences of its loss. The conclusion {{contains a}} brief summary of the thesis and the reasons behind the choice of thi...|$|E

5000|$|Siku {{is split}} across {{two rows of}} pipes. One must {{alternate}} rows with every note in order to play a complete scale. Traditionally, two musicians were required to play the siku, each one taking one row of the instrument. One part of instrument is called ira, another arka. It is considered that spiritually ira corresponds to male principle and arka to female. When many musicians divide in two parts, first playing ira and second playing arka, this gives Andean music a distinctive <b>stereophonic</b> sound. <b>Hear</b> [...]|$|R
