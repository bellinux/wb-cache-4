50|$|To {{meet this}} requirement, Hawker Aircraft {{submitted}} two designs, one a monoplane {{and the other}} a biplane, but both were rejected by the Air Ministry when contracts were awarded for prototypes in 1932, orders going to Blackburn Aircraft (for its F.3 and Westland Aircraft (the Westland F.7/30). Despite this rejection, Hawker decided to construct a single example of its biplane design, the Hawker P.V.3 as a Private Venture without an Air Ministry order. The P.V.3, design of which was led by Hawker's Chief Designer Sidney Camm, was an enlarged development of Hawker's Fury fighter, powered by the preferred Goshawk. Like the Fury, it had an all-metal structure with fabric covered wings (which unlike the Fury were swept back), tail and aft fuselage, with a metal skinned forward fuselage. <b>Steam</b> <b>condensers</b> for the Goshawk engine were fitted in the upper wing, supplemented by a smaller retractable condenser under the fuselage.

25|$|Cooling towers {{originated}} in the 19th century {{through the development of}} condensers for use with the <b>steam</b> engine. <b>Condensers</b> use relatively cool water, via various means, to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines. This reduces the back pressure, which in turn reduces the steam consumption, and thus the fuel consumption, {{while at the same time}} increasing power and recycling boiler-water. However the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water, without which they are impractical. The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040–2069. While water usage is not an issue with marine engines, it forms a significant limitation for many land-based systems.|$|R
2500|$|The primary {{disadvantage}} of single shaft combined cycle power plants {{is that the}} number of <b>steam</b> turbines, <b>condensers</b> and condensate systems – and perhaps the number of cooling towers and circulating water systems – increases to match the number of gas turbines. For a multi-shaft combined cycle power plant there is only one steam turbine, condenser {{and the rest of the}} heat sink for up to three gas turbines; only their size increases. Having only one large steam turbine and heat sink results in low cost because of economies of scale. [...] A larger steam turbine also allows the use of higher pressures and results in a more efficient steam cycle. Thus the overall plant size and the associated number of gas turbines required have a major impact on whether a single shaft combined cycle power plant or a multiple shaft combined cycle power plant is more economical.|$|R

There were two boiler rooms, one each end of the engine room. Each contained two 17 ft and two 9 ft boilers operating at 61 psi. Similar high pressure systems had been used on HMS Alexandra launched in 1875 and Temeraire in 1876, but they were a recent innovation and more economical than the previous low pressure engines. Gangs of stokers were continuously bringing coal from the bunkers to feed the fires.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTwo separate computer codes were coup led with a constrained function minimization code to produce automated marine condenser design and optimization programs of vastly different complexity. The first program, OPCODE 1, was {{developed from the}} Heat Exchange Institute's Standards for <b>Steam</b> Surface <b>Condensers</b> (HEI). The second program, OPCODE 2, was developed from the sophisticated ORCON 1, a computer code produced by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. CONMIN, the optimization program, was developed at the Ames Research Center. OPCODE 1 was well verified using main condenser input data of an aircraft carrier and a destroyer escort. Verification of OPCODE 2, using main condenser data of an aircraft carrier, was less satisfactory due to the conservative nature of flooding effects on the outside film heat transfer coefficient used in ORCON 1. OPCODE 1 is an excellent design tool for the conceptual design of a marine condenser. Optimized test cases run with OPCODE 1 show that a condenser designed by the HEI method is nearly optimum with respect to volume. Test cases with OPCODE 2 show that enhancing the heat transfer on the shell-side by 80 percent yields a condenser with ten percent less volume than the unenhanced case.

40|$|Abstract: Some of {{the more}} signicant {{thermodynamic}} methods to improve the efciency of coal-based electricity generation technologies are surveyed and examined, focusing on minor practical improvements that can be undertaken with limited effort and cost. Two categories of methods are examined. The rst is efciency-improvement techniques such as better maintenance and control, application of exergy and related analysis methods, and use of computer-based simulation, analysis, optimization, and design. The second category includes efciency-improvement measures for devices, including <b>steam</b> generators, <b>condensers,</b> reheaters, and regenerative feedwater heaters. A case study is presented. It is concluded, for coal-red electricity generation plants, that (i) many useful techniques exist (especially exergy analysis) and {{should be used for}} identifying and designing efciency improvements, and (ii) the many possible measures to improve efciency should be weighed against other factors and where appropriate implemented.

The article examines exploitation challenges of the <b>steam</b> turbine <b>condensers</b> and methods of clearing them from sedimentations.

The installation of the ball-cleaning system practically excludes defects of the chemical and mechanical cleaning methods, which leads to the condenser pipes life-in-service increase, the full-flow condensate quality improvement, reliability and efficient performance enhancement of the steam turbines equipment.
