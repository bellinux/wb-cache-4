[24] and Miyoshi and Ibáñez [55] the technological advancement {{has resulted in a}} positive trend of fuel efficiency. ATD was measured from engine efficiencies, aerodynamic <b>efficiencies,</b> and <b>structural</b> <b>efficiencies</b> [4, 51]. Engine efficiencies were expressed in term of engine thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC), lower value of TSFC result in better fuel efficiency [4, 25]. Aerodynamic efficiencies were evaluated in term of lift/drag (L/D) ratio [74]; higher value of lift/drag ratio can result in improved fuel <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Structural</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were assessed in term of ratio of operating empty weight (OEW) to maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) [4, 73]. The use of advanced composite material has reduced the structural weight of aircrafts [76]. Therefore, our construct include the TSFC, L/D ratio, OEW, and MTOW for the measurement of ATD dimension.|$|R
