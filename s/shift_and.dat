The protagonist in Blue Shift is a security guard, Barney Calhoun, employed by the Black Mesa Research Facility. After a scientific mishap causes Black Mesa to be invaded by aliens, Calhoun must fight his way to safety. The game received mostly positive reception. Many reviewers were critical of the short length of the game and the lack of new content, although the inclusion of a High Definition pack that upgraded the models and textures in both Blue <b>Shift</b> <b>and</b> the preceding Half-Life games was praised.|$|E
30|$|In summary, {{these results}} show that PEGylated AuNPs {{experience}} smaller spectral <b>shifting</b> <b>and</b> decreased broadening in a cellular environment compared with bare AuNPs, likely due to lower cellular uptake and formation of smaller intracellular clusters. Such results suggest that PEGylating NPs can be utilized as a method for mitigating changes to NPs’ spectral profiles; however, we also find that PEGylation does not completely prevent spectral <b>shifting</b> <b>and</b> broadening, and that the extent of spectral <b>shifting</b> <b>and</b> broadening is time- and exposure dose-dependent (Fig.  2).|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} Rhodes left school, aged 16, he had joined Kirkheaton Cricket Club {{and started to}} take cricket seriously: he watched Yorkshire when they played close to his home and began to {{consider}} {{a career as a}} professional cricketer. Around 1893 he took a job working on the railway in the local town of Mirfield. By now playing regularly for Kirkheaton Second XI, Rhodes's keenness to reach one game on time led him to ring the off-duty bell {{before the end of the}} <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> as a result he lost his job. Subsequently, he worked on a local farm, which allowed him more time for cricket. By 1895 he achieved a place in the Kirkheaton first team, and was recommended to Gala Cricket Club, of Galashiels, Scotland, as a professional.|$|E

5|$|Fire arrow: One of the {{earliest}} weaponized forms of gunpowder was the fire arrow which received {{its name from the}} translated Chinese term huǒjiàn (火箭), which literally means fire arrow. In China a 'fire arrow' referred to a gunpowder projectile consisting of a bag of incendiary gunpowder attached to the shaft of an arrow from the 9th century onward. Later on solid fuel rockets utilizing gunpowder were used to provide arrows with propulsive force and the term fire arrow became synonymous with rockets in the Chinese language. In other languages such as Sanskrit 'fire arrow' (agni astra) underwent a different semantic <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> became synonymous with 'cannon.' Fire arrows are the predecessors of fire lances, the first firearm.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, Taiwan's {{aboriginal}} inhabitants experienced economic {{competition and}} military conflict {{with a series}} of colonising newcomers. Centralised government policies designed to foster language <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> cultural assimilation, as well as continued contact with the colonisers through trade, intermarriage and other intercultural processes, have resulted in varying degrees of language death and loss of original cultural identity. For example, of the approximately 26 known languages of the Taiwanese aborigines (collectively referred to as the Formosan languages), at least ten are now extinct, five are moribund and several are to some degree endangered. These languages are of unique historical significance, since most historical linguists consider Taiwan to be the original homeland of the Austronesian language family.|$|E

In forming these questions, students are actively brainstorming and recalling prior knowledge. At this point, the teacher provides specific conditions of the issue discussed, and students must adapt their prior knowledge, along with that of their peers, to generate a solution.

5|$|The term double burden {{arises from}} the fact that many women, as well as some men, are {{responsible}} for both domestic labor and paid labor. However, due to the thinking that a woman's time spent in domestic work is more valuable than a woman's time spent doing paid work, and that a man's time spent doing paid work is more valuable than a man's time spent doing domestic work, there is the issue of women having to do a large amount of both paid and unpaid work, leading to the double burden.

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star may {{accumulate}} sufficient material from a stellar companion to raise its core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion, at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it. There are three avenues by which this detonation is theorized to happen: stable accretion of material from a companion, the collision of two white dwarfs, or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites. The dominant mechanism by which Type Ia supernovae are produced remains unclear. Despite this uncertainty in how Type Ia supernovae are produced, Type Ia supernovae have very uniform properties, and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances. Some calibrations are required {{to compensate for the}} gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high red <b>shift,</b> <b>and</b> for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum.|$|E

On {{the roof of a}} large tower, Cord destroys a building with a surface-to-air missile launcher to create a diversion. When he meets with Chi again, she is being threatened by Kostov, who thinks she has betrayed his men. Chi kills Kostov before he can pull the trigger. With Chi's help, Cord uses an elevator to go {{to the top of the}} tower and he activates a cable car leading to an island. Cord explores the docking area, and he finds Alexandria in a cell on the security level. Cord uses the main elevator in the complex to access the other levels. Cord creates a diversion and enters level 1, where he inserts the explosive charge into the Super Computer. A cut scene is shown that reveals that Alpha has betrayed him. In a transmission, she tells that premier Nagarov had to be certain that Cord was not acting on her orders when he attacked the refinery. She assured Nagarov that Cord had not entered the facility, but Nagarov had a recording of Cord in the refinery. It resulted in a simple policy <b>shift</b> <b>and</b> the British are now working with the Volgians. As the reactor becomes critical, Nagarov and Lukyan leave the room. Until this moment, the game has taken place in Cord's memory, as he was interrogated by Nagarov after being captured, but from this point on it takes place in real time.|$|E
5|$|Modern DST {{was first}} {{proposed}} by the New Zealand entomologist George Hudson, whose shift work job gave him leisure time to collect insects and led him to value after-hours daylight. In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two-hour daylight-saving <b>shift,</b> <b>and</b> after considerable interest was expressed in Christchurch, he followed up in an 1898 paper. Many publications credit DST proposal to the prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett, who independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre-breakfast ride, when he observed with dismay how many Londoners slept through {{a large part of}} a summer day. An avid golfer, he also disliked cutting short his round at dusk. His solution was to advance the clock during the summer months, a proposal he published two years later. The proposal was taken up by the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) Robert Pearce, who introduced the first Daylight Saving Bill to the House of Commons on February 12, 1908. A select committee was set up to examine the issue, but Pearce's bill did not become law, and several other bills failed in the following years. Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915.|$|E

Existing literature studies profit <b>shifting</b> <b>and</b> transfer pricing separately. In practice, the choice of debt-to-asset ratios in affiliates and the transfer price of debt are interrelated management decisions that are also mutually affected by government regulation.

A second result is that stricter regulation of debt shifting (transfer pricing) can potentially increase the use of transfer pricing (debt <b>shifting)</b> <b>and</b> thus the amount of profits shifted...|$|R
