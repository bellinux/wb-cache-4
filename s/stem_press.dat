A continuous ribbon of glass is passed along a conveyor belt, heated in a furnace, and then blown by precisely aligned air nozzles through holes in the conveyor belt into molds. Thus the glass bulbs are created. After the bulbs are blown, and cooled, they are cut off the ribbon machine; a typical machine of this sort produces 50,000 bulbs per hour. The filament and its supports are assembled on a glass stem, which is fused to the bulb. The air is pumped out of the bulb, and the evacuation tube in the <b>stem</b> <b>press</b> is sealed by a flame. The bulb is then inserted into the lamp base, and the whole assembly tested.|$|E

An experimental design with different equipment that was studied to discover {{the effect of the}} dehydration rate of banana stems. We are trying to extract natural fibers from Hainan immense resources of biological materials. The paper also relates to an equipment for slicing the banana stem into elongated strips and pressing the strips. The result shows that the dehydration rate of banana <b>stem</b> which <b>pressed</b> by Sugarcane Mill (SM) was 57. 0 %(roots), 58. 0 % (central) and 51. 0 % (sheath) respectively. The samples which pressed by Open Roll Mill (ORM) have a lower level of dehydration rate (29. 3 % of roots, 12. 1 % of central, 13. 5 % of sheath, respectively) ...|$|R

50|$|The NCAA does adjust APR, on a student-by-student basis, in two circumstances. One {{exception}} {{that can be}} made, is for student-athletes who leave prior to graduation, while in good academic standing, to pursue a professional career. Another is for student-athletes who transfer to another school while meeting minimum academic requirements and student-athletes who return to graduate at a later date. Compiling college athletes’ graduation rates <b>stemmed</b> partly from <b>press</b> coverage that 76 to 92 percent of professional athletes lacked college degrees and from revelations that some were functionally illiterate. In the 2010-11 cycle, the NCAA granted nearly 700 APR adjustments in the latter category, {{out of a total}} of over 6,400 Division I teams. (The APR is calculated based only on scholarship players already, not walk-ons) Numerous other sources, from sports conferences to schools themselves, document much lower graduation rates for college football and men’s basketball and baseball players than for general students. Compounding matters is that only about 57 percent of all college students complete a bachelor's degree in six years.|$|R
40|$|Quantum Moves is {{a citizen}} science game that investigates {{the ability of}} humans to solve complex physics {{challenges}} that are intractable for computers. During the launch of Quantum Moves in April 2016 the game's leaderboard function broke down resulting in a "no leaderboard" game experience for some players {{for a couple of}} days (though their scores were still displayed). The subsequent quick fix of an all-time Top 5 leaderboard, and the following long-term implementation of a personalized relative-position (infinite) leaderboard provided us with a unique opportunity to compare and investigate the effect of different leaderboard implementations on player performance in a points-driven citizen science game. All three conditions were live sequentially during the game's initial influx of more than 150. 000 players that <b>stemmed</b> from global <b>press</b> attention on Quantum Moves due the publication of a Nature paper about the use of Quantum Moves in solving a specific quantum physics problem. Thus, it has been possible to compare the three conditions and their influence on the performance (defined as a player's quality of game play related to a high-score) of over 4500 new players. These 4500 odd players in our three leaderboard-conditions have a similar demographic background based upon the time-window over which the implementations occurred and controlled against Player ID tags. Our results placed Condition 1 experience over condition 3 and in some cases even over condition 2 which goes against the general assumption that leaderboards enhance gameplay and its subsequent overuse as a an oft-relied upon element that designers slap onto a game to enhance said appeal. Our study thus questions the use of leaderboards as general performance enhancers in gamification contexts and brings some empirical rigor to an often under-reported but overused phenomenon.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the wine sector has been {{characterized}} by an increased focus on the diversification of wine products. 				This change has been welcomed by consumers. In fact, today's consumers are willing to experiment with new products and unusual combinationswhich has stimulated research aimed at the discovery of native grape varieties suitable for for winemaking. In this context, particular attention are receiving vines {{for the production of}} dessert wines. Many regions have made efforts in the search for varieties and techniques able to better promote the drying process. At CREA-VE Turi-BA, there is an ongoing recovery and exploitation of indigenous grape varieties in the regions of Southern Italy and today more than 3, 000 accessions of wine grapes are preserved. 				In the present work we have investigate the possibility of the use of certain accessions of Vitis vinifera varieties (collection CREA-VE Turi-BA) deemed attractive for the production of dessert wines. Accessions presenting a good sugar content and a good titratable acidity were selected; namely, Greco bianco b. (named Q 19) and Mantonico bianco b. (named R 8) were compared to the cv of Malvasia di Lipari b. Ampelographic and ampelometric analyses, followed by molecular analysis, were carried out for varietal assessment. 				A rate of the grapes were fermented immediately after harvest with standard procedure, in comparison to rates vinified after withering. The latter was made in a greenhouse type structure with parts of natural and unforced air, without any additional energy expense. At the end of the process, a loss in weight of the grapes equal to 30 – 35 % was realized. The grapes are then <b>stemmed,</b> crushed, <b>pressed</b> and fermented by selected yeast under controlled temperature. 				Upon completion of the fermentation and subsequent stabilization, the wines were analyzed for the most important enological parameters and subjected to evaluation by a panel of expert tasters. Chemical analysis of wines showed that an alcohol content ranging to 11 – 12 % volume was reached with in the standard wine-making; whilst, for the vinification of dried grapes the alcohol content was equal to 16 % vol for Mantonico bianco b. and 18 % vol. for and Greco bianco. 				Organoleptic analysis of the wines showed a greater appreciation for both of dessert wines. The best ratings were given for the olfactory characteristics (floral and fruity aromas) and taste characteristics. In particular, the Greco bianco b. had excellent scores slightly lower than Malvasia di Lipari b. 				Therefore, the tested varieties have shown a good potential for the production of dessert wines related to typicality of the grape and the region. Dessert wines produced, have a complex flavor profile and interesting for the high acidic component, which improved the taste perception of wine and attenuated the sensation of sweetness. That feature could allow a good wine aging, too...|$|R
5000|$|Chatterjee {{was born}} in 1958 {{and raised in the}} {{district}} of Ballygunge, Kolkata (Calcutta), India, moving to the United Kingdom in 1985. In the 1970s and 1980s while studying at Kolkata Medical College he worked part-time for a left-wing political party campaigning against poverty and later worked at a hospital where he regularly treated patients from the oldest and poorest districts of the city as well as refugees from the civil war with what is now Bangladesh. Later while living in the UK he became concerned by the increasingly common portrayal of the widespread destitution and disease in his native Calcutta which <b>stemmed</b> from <b>press</b> reporting of the work of Mother Teresa. At that point he describes his attitude to Mother Teresa as [...] "If anything, I was positively inclined towards her" [...] although he says he never saw any of her nuns in the slums. However it was this image at odds with his own experience as a doctor in Calcutta that caused him to look more closely at her work and reputation. From the 1990s onwards he began to uncover what he calls a [...] "cult of suffering" [...] which Mother Teresa and her followers in the Missionaries of Charity were running back in Calcutta supported by her friend Pope John Paul II.In February 1993 Chatterjee sent a proposal for a short documentary to Vanya Del Borgo, associate producer of Bandung Productions which was owned by Tariq Ali. The proposal was passed to a Channel 4 commissioner who approved it, and Del Borgo with Chatterjee's proposal began work, approaching journalist and author Christopher Hitchens to write and present it. The documentary became the 1994 film Hells's Angel. Chatterjee found the documentary [...] "too sensationalist" [...] and Hitchens went on to write his book The Missionary Position.Chatterjee spent the next year travelling and interviewing people who had worked closely with Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity and began to campaign against the conditions in Nirmal Hriday, also known as the Kalighat Home for the Dying in Calcutta. In particular he heard stories of lack of basic hygiene, the absence of any pain medication, and the frequent reuse of hypodermic needles.Chatterjee then began work on a book, eventually released by Meteor Books in 2002 under the original title Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict. Chatterjee says in addition to the hours of interviews, [...] "I started in pre Internet days and I spent months in libraries in London. I also travelled the world researching it. I followed slum dwellers, beggars, destitute children with a video camera. I interviewed hundreds of people. I stood with video camera outside Teresa's home for hours." ...|$|R
40|$|Since their {{development}} {{over thirty years}} ago, replication incompetent retroviral vectors have become indispensable tools for stable genetic modification in gene therapy and experimental biology (Mann et al. 1983). One notable feature of these vectors is that they irreversibly integrate their genome into the genomic DNA of the target cell, where it is copied along with the cellular genes and passed on to daughter cells when the cell proliferates. Because integration occurs at a random location, each transduced cell within a population of reasonable complexity acquires a retroviral genome at a unique site. The integration process does exhibit some preferences, but the process is still random and most genomic sites are amenable to integration. By using methods that can distinguish between these distinct integration sites (ISs) based on their unique properties, one can enumerate the ISs present in a cellular population. More interestingly, these unique properties can be observed over time as cellular clones expand, contract, differentiate, migrate, die or express other behaviors, allowing one to make inferences about clonal biological potential and proliferative dynamics. This concept, which is most {{commonly referred to as}} “clonal tracking,” will occupy the entirety of this thesis aside from chapter 2. Chapter 2 presents two works improving the function and production of lentiviral vectors based on human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV- 1), a slightly newer retroviral genetic engineering technology that has almost completely superseded that of retroviral vectors based on murine viruses (Cooper et al. 2011; Cooper et al. 2015). Chapter 3 contains two studies in which clonal tracking was used to demonstrate the ability of either hematopoietic or cancer stem cells to produce multiple distinct cell types (Stoyanova et al. 2013; McCracken et al. 2013). Chapter 4 describes experiments in which clonal tracking was used to determine whether a recently discovered immunophenotypically defined population of pluripotent stem cell-derived progenitor cells possesses multipotency (Chin, Cooper et al., <b>Stem</b> Cells, In <b>Press).</b> The unprecedented complexity of ISs sequenced in this work prompted a more thorough statistical examination of the issue of sampling in IS sequencing approaches. Chapter 5 contains multiple published collaborative studies in which IS sequencing was used to examine the safety of gene and cell engineering approaches for therapeutic applications in gene therapy or regenerative medicine (Karumbayaram et al. 2012; Awe et al. 2013; Candotti et al. 2012; Carbonaro et al. 2014; Romero et al. 2013; Hoban et al. 2015). Chapter 6 discusses work on the safety and efficacy of retroviral gene therapy in a human clinical trial for adenosine deaminase- deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID). In addition to applying the molecular and statistical methods for IS-based clonal tracking developed during my graduate work, this analysis also involved large-scale sequencing of the T-cell receptor rearrangements that are the foundation of the adaptive immunological repertoire. Chapter 7 summarizes the work and discusses unanswered questions for potential future research...|$|R
