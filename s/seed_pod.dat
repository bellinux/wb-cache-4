5|$|Narcissus {{plants have}} one to several basal leaves which are linear, ligulate or strap shaped (long and narrow), {{sometimes}} channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) {{or may not}} (sessile) have a petiole stalk. The leaves are flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb. The emerging plant generally has two leaves, but the mature plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a cutin containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour is light green to blue-green. In the mature plant the leaves extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species the leaves are low hanging. The leaf base is encased in a colourless sheath. After flowering the leaves turn yellow and die back once the <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> (fruit) is ripe.|$|E
25|$|To some extent, {{harvesting}} for {{poppy seeds}} is {{in conflict with}} harvesting for opium. Poppy seeds of superior quality are harvested when they are ripe, after the <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> has dried. Traditionally, opium is harvested while the seed pods are green and their latex is abundant, but when the seeds have just begun to grow.|$|E
25|$|The {{poppy seed}} harvest {{can be a}} {{by-product}} of opium poppy cultivation for opium, poppy straw, or both opium and poppy straw. Conversely, poppy straw can be a by-product of cultivation of poppy seeds. Compared to the <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> and straw, the seeds contain very low levels of opiates. The seeds may be washed to obtain poppy tea but a large amount is needed, around 300-400g depending on the levels of opiates.|$|E

25|$|Larger {{males with}} the highest {{alkaloid}} content can be distinguished by a specific pheromonal scent that predicts {{the content of the}} alkaloidal gifts: hydroxydanaidal (HD). There is a relationship between the size of the male, the type of food the males fed on as larvae, and the composition of its spermatophores. For example, males that fed inside a <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> rather than on leaves produce higher levels of HD. In addition, these males have higher adult weights and have higher systemic loads of PA, the metabolic precursor of HD. By selecting for HD-rich males, the female moth ensures the receipt of a large alkaloid gift (phenotypic benefit) and genes that encode for large size (genetic benefit).|$|E
500|$|Flowering occurs from October to January, and {{is related}} to altitude: plants at lower {{elevations}} flower earlier than ones higher up. The flower heads, known as inflorescences, are terminal—that is, they arise {{on the ends of}} small branches—and are surrounded by small inconspicuous hairy bracts. This sets T.truncata apart from all other waratah species, which have hairless bracts. In the shape of a flattened raceme, the flower heads are [...] in diameter and composed of 10 to 35 individual flowers. They are most commonly bright red, though scattered yellow-flowered plants occur. These were described as forma lutea but are mere colour variations and not genetically distinct. Yellow-flowered plants have both red- and yellow-flowered progeny. Anthesis is basipetal; that is, the flowers at the base (edges) of the flower head open first. The flower is composed of a 2cm-long perianth on a 1cm-long stalk, with a pronounced kink in the style above the [...] ovary; all other waratah species have gently incurving styles. Anatomically, the individual flower bears a sessile anther (that is, it lacks a filament), which lies next to the stigma {{at the end of the}} style. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> then develops. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore.|$|E
2500|$|True vanilla {{comes from}} a <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> of an orchid called vanilla planifolia. This plant grows as a vine on host trees and is native to this area. The pods are green when harvested, and turn black when dried. In the Totonac language, vanilla is called Xanath and is {{used to make a}} liquor which is almost never seen outside of the Papantla area. These people have used vanilla for centuries as a flavoring, a perfume and as medicine. In the early colonial period, the Spanish quickly {{exported}} vanilla to Europe and a number of cultivators became wealthy. The name “vanilla” comes from the Spanish “vainilla” which means little <b>seed</b> <b>pod.</b> The growing of vanilla remained a monopoly of Mexico until hand pollination methods were developed that allowed the plant to grow {{in other parts of the}} world, devastating the industry here. Today, Mexican production of vanilla trails behind production in parts of Africa and Asia. [...] In spite of this, the Academy of Sciences and Gastronomic Arts in Paris in 1921chose to pay homage to the Totonacs who discovered vanilla.|$|E

2500|$|The plant terminates in a dichotomous cyme, with a {{peduncle}} supporting each flower. The floral {{leaves are}} bifid (split in two parts) and ovate, while the involucral bracts are bright red, irregularly acuminate in shape (e.g., like a slipper), and about [...] in length with a long, thin tube. The flower is void of scent. The male pedicel is hairy, while the female is glabrous. The <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> is about [...] long and [...] wide, and ovoid in shape (with truncated ends).|$|E
2500|$|Cotton {{is grown}} {{anywhere}} with long, hot dry summers {{with plenty of}} sunshine and low humidity. Indian cotton, gossypium arboreum, is finer but the staple is only suitable for hand processing. American cotton, gossypium hirsutum, produces the longer staple needed for machine production. Planting is from September to mid November and the crop is harvested between March and June. The cotton bolls are harvested by stripper harvesters and spindle pickers, that remove the entire boll from the plant. The cotton boll is the <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> of the cotton plant, attached {{to each of the}} thousands of seeds are fibres about 2.5cm long.|$|E
2500|$|Flowers {{generally}} {{last about}} two weeks. At {{the end of}} the flowering period, the petals drop and the ovary, if pollinated, begins to swell. The seed forms in five lobes, with one lobe producing significantly smaller numbers of seeds than the other lobes. [...] On average, 300–600 seed are produced, depending on species and pollination success. Seed takes five months to mature, at which point the <b>seed</b> <b>pod</b> turns brown and splits open, scattering seed. The seeds are 1.5–2mm in length and have a rough, waxy coat which makes it hydrophobic, possibly for seed dispersal by flowing water. Sarracenia seed requires a stratification period to germinate in large numbers. Plants grown from seed start producing functioning traps almost immediately, although they differ in morphology from adult traps for the first year or so, being simpler in structure. Plants require 3–5 years to reach maturity from seed.|$|E
