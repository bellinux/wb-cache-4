In particular, the aim of the study is to suggest <b>simple</b> <b>stiffening</b> and strengthening element to improve the axial flexibility and strength of the junctions.

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} studies {{were conducted to}} determine the noise transmission into acoustic enclosures ranging from simple rectangular box models to full scale light aircraft in flight. The structural models include <b>simple,</b> <b>stiffened,</b> curved stiffened, and orthotropic panels and double wall windows. The theoretical solutions were obtained by model analysis. Transfer matrix and finite element procedures were utilized. Good agreement between theory and experiment has been achieved. An efficient acoustic add-on treatment was developed for interior noise control in a twin engine light aircraft...|$|R
2500|$|The corset has {{undergone}} many changes. Originally, {{it was known}} as [...] "a pair of bodys" [...] in the late 16th century. It was a <b>simple</b> bodice, <b>stiffened</b> with boning of reed or whalebone. A busk made of wood, horn, whalebone, metal or ivory further reinforced the central front. It was most often laced in the back, and was, at first, a garment reserved for the aristocracy. The term [...] "stays" [...] was generally used during the 17th and 18th centuries. In the 17th century, tabs (called [...] "fingers") at the waist were added.|$|R
40|$|The {{dependence}} of Tc on nearly hydrostatic pressure has been measured for an isotopically pure (11 B) MgB 2 sample in a helium-loaded diamond-anvil-cell to nearly 20 GPa. Tc decreases monotonically with pressure from 39. 1 K at ambient pressure to 20. 9 K at 19. 2 GPa. The initial dependence {{is the same}} as that obtained earlier (dTc/dP = - 1. 11 (2) K/GPa) on the same sample in a He-gas apparatus to 0. 7 GPa. The observed pressure dependence Tc(P) to 20 GPa can be readily described in terms of <b>simple</b> lattice <b>stiffening</b> within standard phonon-mediated BCS superconductivity.

40|$|Pretensioned {{structures}} are receiving considerable attention as candidate large space structures. A typical {{example is a}} hoop-column antenna. The large number of preloaded members requires efficient analytical methods for concept validation and design. Validation through analyses is especially important since ground testing may be limited due to gravity effects and structural size. The present investigation has the objective to present {{an examination of the}} analytical modeling of pretensioned members undergoing nonlinear vibrations. Two approximate nonlinear analysis are developed to model general structural arrangements which include beam-columns and pretensioned cables attached to a common nucleus, such as may occur at a joint of a pretensioned structure. Attention is given to structures undergoing nonlinear steady-state oscillations due to sinusoidal excitation forces. Three analyses, linear, quasi-linear, and nonlinear are conducted and applied to study the response of a relatively <b>simple</b> cable <b>stiffened</b> structure...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the FEM analyzing of the dynamical behavior of the ligno-cellulose plates from the guitar structures. It had been analyzed the response system in two cases: free vibrations and forced vibrations under the conditions of variation of different parameters: types of materials, density, Young’s modulus, damping coefficient, thickness and structure of plates (<b>simple</b> and with <b>stiffening</b> braces). The FEM results were compared to the one’s from the specialized literature in this field. The theoretical and experimental results are useful to optimize the plate structures for improvement of the acoustic quality of the classical guitar. The paper contains manifold figures...|$|R
40|$|Creep-age forming (CAF) is an {{interesting}} process for the airframe industry, as {{it is able to}} form or shape panels into smooth, but complex, curvatures. In the CAF process, the ageing cycle of the alloy is used to relax external loads imposed to the part, through creep mechanisms. Those relaxed stresses impose a new curvature to the part. At the end of the process, significant spring back (sometimes about 70 %) is observed and the success in achieving the desired form depends on how the spring back can be predicted in order to compensate it by tooling changes. Most of the applications relate to <b>simple</b> (non <b>stiffened)</b> panels. The present work deals with the CAF of aluminum panels for aircraft wing skin application. CAF was performed using vacuum-bagging autoclave technique in small scale complex shape stiffened panels, machined from an AA 7475 alloy plate. An analytical reference model from the literature was employed estimate the spring back effect in such panel geometry. This model that deals with simple plates was adapted to stiffened panels using a geometric simplification, resulting in a semi-empirical model. The results demonstrate that CAF is a promising process to form stiffene...|$|R
40|$|Superconducting accelerators, {{such as the}} International Linear Collider (ILC), rely on {{very high}} Q {{accelerating}} cavities to achieve high electric fields at low RF power. Such cavities have very narrow resonances: a few kHz with a 1. 3 GHz resonance frequency for the ILC. Several mechanical factors cause tune shifts much larger than this: pressure variations in the liquid helium bath; microphonics from pumps and other mechanical devices; and for a pulsed machine such as the ILC, Lorentz force detuning (pressure from the contained RF field). <b>Simple</b> passive <b>stiffening</b> is limited by many manufacturing and material considerations. Therefore, active tuning using piezo actuators is needed. Here we study a supply for their operation. Since commercial power amplifiers are expensive, we analyzed the characteristics of four power amplifiers: (iPZD) built by Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (Sezione di Pisa); and a DC-DC converter power supply built in Fermilab (Piezo Master); and two commercial amplifiers, Piezosystem jena and Piezomechanik. This paper presents an analysis and characterization of these amplifiers to understand the cost benefit and reliability when using in a large scale, pulsed beam accelerator like the ILC...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} punching shear capacity of flat slab-column junctions. A three dimensional non-linear finite element program based on 20 node isoparametric solid element {{was used for the}} investigation. The non-linear 3 -D elastic isotropic model proposed by Motsovos was used to describe the behaviour of concrete before cracking or crushing. After cracking, a yield criteria for 2 -D model similar to Kupfer-Hilsdorf was used and concrete was assumed to be anisotropic. No softening in compression is assumed. Smeared crack approach with <b>simple</b> tension <b>stiffening</b> and shear retention equations were employed to mimic the post-cracking behaviour of concrete. Reinforcing bars were represented by one dimensional element embedded in the solid elements and for both tension and compression, linear elastic-plastic behaviour is assumed. A comparison was first made between the predictions of slab behaviour using Kotsovos' model (In-house program) and plasticity based model used in the commercial package ABAQUS. From this it was concluded that Kotsovos' concrete model is a good model for the three dimensional analysis of the punching shear problem but the ABAQUS model was unsuitable. In order to achieve an accurate and economical solution for the non-linear analysis, a parametric study was carried out to choose a suitable analytical model. After having chosen the "best" concrete model, over 175 slabs from different sources were analysed using a constant set parameters. The analysis includes various types connections (interior, edge and corner) with and without shear reinforcement, subjected to shear force alone or to a combination of shear force and unbalanced moment. These slabs cover most of the factors affecting punching shear strength, such as slab thickness, flexural reinforcement ratios, concrete strength, and column size. This study also includes the effect of in-plane restraint on punching shear strength of slabs...|$|R
40|$|We study {{relativistic}} mean-field (RMF) models including nucleons {{interacting with}} scalar, vector and iso-vector mean fields and self- and cross- mean-field interaction terms. Usually, {{in such a}} models {{the magnitude of the}} scalar field increases monotonically with the nucleon density, and the nucleon effective mass decreases. We demonstrate that the latter quantity stops to decrease and the equation of state stiffens, provided the mean-field self-interaction potential rises sharply in a narrow vicinity of the values of mean fields corresponding to nucleon densities n> n_*>n_ 0, where n_ 0 is the nuclear saturation density. As the result the limiting neutron star mass increases. This procedure offers a <b>simple</b> way to <b>stiffen</b> the equation of state at densities above n_* without altering it at densities n< n_ 0. The developed scheme allows an application to neutron stars of the RMF models, which are well fitted to finite nuclei but do not fulfill the experimental constraint on the limiting neutron star mass. The exemplary application of the method to the well-known FSUGold model allows us to increase the limiting neutron star mass from 1. 72 M_ to M ≥ 2. 01 M_.

40|$|Previously the Exploration Concepts Branch of NASA Langley Research Center has {{developed}} techniques for automating the preliminary design level of launch vehicle airframe structural analysis {{for purposes of}} enhancing historical regression based mass estimating relationships. This past work was useful and greatly reduced design time, however its application area was very narrow {{in terms of being}} able to handle a large variety in structural and vehicle general arrangement alternatives. Implementation of the analysis approach presented herein also incorporates some newly developed computer programs. Loft is a program developed to create analysis meshes and simultaneously define structural element design regions. A simple component defining ASCII file is read by Loft to begin the design process. HSLoad is a Visual Basic implementation of the HyperSizer Application Programming Interface, which automates the structural element design process. Details of these two programs and their use are explained in this paper. A feature which falls naturally out of the above analysis paradigm is the concept of "reference models". The flexibility of the FEA based JAVA processing procedures and associated process control classes coupled with the general utility of Loft and HSLoad make it possible to create generic program template files for analysis of components ranging from something as <b>simple</b> as a <b>stiffened</b> flat panel, to curved panels, fuselage and cryogenic tank components, flight control surfaces, wings, through full air and space vehicle general arrangements...|$|R
