5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has {{a direct impact on}} the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving <b>specific</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> nearly 3%).|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} blocks of JF-17 {{is powered by}} a single Russian RD-93 {{turbofan}} engine, which is a variant of the RD-33 engine used on the MiG-29 fighter. The engine gives more thrust and significantly lower <b>specific</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> than turbojet engines fitted to older combat aircraft being replaced by the JF-17. The advantages of using a single engine are a reduction in maintenance time and cost when compared to twin-engined fighters.

40|$|From a {{theoretical}} viewpoint, a lean or ultra-lean mixture improves thermal efficiency of internal combustion engines when operating at partial loads. This is confirmed is current practice with compression-ignited motors. However, spark-ignited engines actually reach the lowest <b>specific</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumptions</b> at air-fuel ratios {{not very far}} from the stoichiometric when the fuel is gasoline, since with leaner mixtures combustion becomes too slow and erratic. Stratified-charge engines allow leaner mixtures, but they require combustion chamber designs that penalize efficiency. The presence of hydrogen in the mixture increases combustion speed and reduces misfiring. As a result, the lowest <b>specific</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumptions</b> are obtained with leaner mixtures {{as a whole and}} are reduced in amounts, as the ratio of hydrogen to the total amount of fuel supplied is increased.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the removal of internal reciprocating stresses by the complete removal of reciprocating internal parts typically found in a piston engine, the Wankel engine is constructed with an iron rotor within a housing made of aluminium, which has a greater coefficient of thermal expansion. This ensures that even a severely overheated Wankel engine cannot seize, as is {{likely to occur in}} an overheated piston engine. This is a substantial safety benefit when used in aircraft. In addition, the absence of valves and valve trains increases safety.

25|$|The major {{drawback}} of {{the original}} Regulus {{was the use of}} radio-command guidance, which required a constant radio link with the launch ship / submarine that was relatively easy to interfere with. The earlier missile also suffered from restricted range which required the launch ship to launch the missile close to the target and remain exposed until the missile hit the target. To alleviate these drawbacks, the Regulus II was designed with an inertial navigation system, which required no further input from the launch ship / boat after launch, and a greater range through improved aerodynamics, larger fuel capacity, and a lower <b>specific</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> from its jet engine.|$|E

25|$|The {{solution}} to this problem is the removal of the turbine. The ramjet engine consists mostly of a large tube, and is relatively easy to air-cool by forcing extra air around the engine. Experimental ramjet aircraft of the era, like the Lockheed X-7, were reaching speeds as high as Mach4. There are numerous problems with the ramjet engine, however. Fuel economy, or thrust <b>specific</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> in aircraft terms, is extremely poor. This makes general operations like flying from one airbase to another expensive propositions. More problematic is the fact that ramjets rely on forward speed to compress the incoming air, and become efficient above Mach1.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} variant, the J402-CA-702, {{was developed}} internally by the company. This variant added an additional axial compressor stage (bringing the total to two axial stages), which increased the engine length by only 4 in (10cm), yet increased the thrust to 970lbf (4.3kN). The engine was later selected {{to power the}} MQM-107D, an improved version of the target drone. The addition of additional compressor stage increased the pressure ratio and overall airflow through the engine, and necessitated {{the development of a}} new turbine section. Teledyne designed and tested the new two stage axial compressor early in the J402's life (mid 1970s), but did not work on the new turbine (and subsequently the -702 variant of the engine) until nearly a decade later in the mid-1980s.

500|$|On 11 March 1943, the Cabinet of the United Kingdom {{formed the}} Brabazon Committee to {{determine}} the UK's airliner needs after {{the conclusion of the}} Second World War. One of its recommendations was for a pressurised, transatlantic mailplane that could carry non-stop, one long ton (1.0 t) of payload at a cruising speed of 400mph (640km/h). De Havilland chose to challenge the widely held scepticism of jet engines as too fuel-hungry and unreliable, So committee member Sir Geoffrey de Havilland, head of the de Havilland company, used his personal influence and his company's expertise to champion the development of a jet propelled aircraft; and proposed a specification for a pure turbojet-powered design. The committee accepted the proposal, calling it the [...] "Type IV" [...] (of five designs), and awarded a development and production contract to de Havilland under the designation Type 106 in February 1945. The type and design were to be so advanced that De Havilland had to undertake the design and development of both the airframe and the engines. This was because in 1945 no turbojet engine manufacturer in the world was drawing up a design specification for an engine with the thrust and <b>specific</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption,</b> that could power an aircraft at the proposed cruising altitude (40 thousand feet), speed, and transatlantic range as was called for by the Type 106. First-phase development of the DH 106 focused on short and intermediate range mailplanes with a small passenger compartment and as few as six seats, before being redefined as a long-range airliner with a capacity of 24 seats. Out of all the Brabazon designs, the DH 106 was seen as the riskiest both in terms of introducing untried design elements and for the financial commitment involved. Nevertheless, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) found the Type IV's specifications attractive, and initially proposed a purchase of 25 aircraft; in December 1945, when a firm contract was laid out, the order total was revised to 10.|$|E

Biobuthanol addition decreases rate of heat release, the combustion temperature and pressure are lower, which {{has an influence on}} lower nitrous oxide (NOx) emission in exhaust gases.

40|$|Economical aspects such as reduced <b>specific</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumptions</b> {{and ever}} growing {{environmental}} requirements on emissions and percieved noise levels, {{are the major}} drivers {{in the search for}} improvement of aircraft engines. For turbofan engines, the global trend is towards higher efficiency which is accomplished by increasing component efficiencies, the bypass ratio and overall pressure ratio while keeping the engine weight low. Concerning the low pressure system, the reduction in weight can be realized by decreasing the number of stages in the compressor. However by doing so, the aerodynamic load per stage must be increased {{in order to maintain the}} same pressure ratio. As the aerodynamic load increases, it becomes more difficult to maintain a high efficiency on the aerodynamic design point and keep a sufficiently high stability margin along the compressor working line. In this thesis a new design methodology, accounting for both efficiency and stability, is presented. In order to utilize the design process for industrial applications, the reduction in total design time and computational resources are also adressed.
