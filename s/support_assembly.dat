50|$|A {{pipe support}} or pipe hanger is a {{designed}} element that transfer the load from a pipe to the supporting structures. The load includes {{the weight of}} the pipe proper, the content that the pipe carries, all the pipe fittings attached to pipe, and the pipe covering such as insulation. The four main functions of a pipe support are to anchor, guide, absorb shock, and support a specified load. Pipe supports used in high or low temperature applications may contain insulation materials. The overall design configuration of a pipe <b>support</b> <b>assembly</b> is dependent on the loading and operating conditions.|$|E

Assembly remained the language of choice for these calculators, which run on a Zilog Z80 processor, although some assembly implements, have been created to ease the difficulty of learning assembly language.

5000|$|The Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device (SLAMMD) was {{installed}} in the HRF-1 during Expedition 11. The SLAMMD measures the on-orbit mass of the crewmembers by applying Newton's second law of motion (force is equal to mass times acceleration). This device can measure a mass between 95 and 240 lb using the force generated by two springs inside the SLAMMD drawer. Each spring {{is attached to a}} cam, which is also attached to a centrally located shaft with a flywheel mounted on top of it. The cam is designed such that, as the springs are stretched over a distance, a constant force is applied to the central shaft. A lanyard wrapped around the large flywheel is fed through a small slit on the SLAMMD front panel. The lanyard is latched onto the SLAMMD guiding arm, where the crewmember sits for a body mass measurement. Attached to the guiding arm is a leg <b>support</b> <b>assembly</b> around which the crew-member wraps his or her legs (as one would for a leg curl machine), a belly pad to help align the stomach, and a headrest.|$|E

40|$|A {{system for}} {{supporting}} and selectively positioning an ion thruster {{relative to a}} surface of a spacecraft includes three angularly spaced thruster support assemblies. Each thruster <b>support</b> <b>assembly</b> includes a frame which has a rotary actuator mounted thereon. The rotary actuator is connected to an actuator member which is rotatably connected to a thruster attachment member connected to a body of the thruster. A stabilizer member is rotatably mounted to the frame and to the thruster attachment member. The thruster is selectively movable in the pitch and yaw directions responsive to movement of the actuator members by the actuators on the thruster support assemblies. A failure of any one actuator on a thruster <b>support</b> <b>assembly</b> will generally still enable limited thruster positioning capability in two directions. In a retracted position the thruster attachment members are held in nested relation in saddles supported on the frames of the thruster support assemblies. The thruster is securely held in the retracted position during periods of high loading such as during launch of the spacecraft...|$|E
