50|$|The <b>Solar</b> <b>Energetic</b> <b>Particle</b> Ionic Charge Analyzer (SEPICA) was the {{instrument}} on the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) that determined the ionic charge states of solar and interplanetary energetic {{particles in the}} energy range from ≈0.2 MeV nucl-1 to ≈5 MeV charge-1. The charge state of energetic ions contains key information to unravel source temperatures, acceleration, fractionation and transport processes for these particle populations. SEPICA {{had the ability to}} resolve individual charge states with a substantially larger geometric factor than its predecessor ULEZEQ on ISEE-1 and -3, on which SEPICA was based. To achieve these two requirements at the same time, SEPICA was composed of one high-charge resolution sensor section and two low- charge resolution, but large geometric factor sections.|$|E

These studies span the energy range from ~ 20 keV/nucleon to > 100 MeV/nucleon, and include elements from He to Ni (2 ≤Z≤ 28).

50|$|The Ultra Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) on the ACE {{spacecraft}} is an ultra-high-resolution {{mass spectrometer}} that measures particle composition and energy spectra of elements He-Ni with energies from ~45 keV/nucleonto a few MeV/nucleon. ULEIS investigates particles accelerated in <b>solar</b> <b>energetic</b> <b>particle</b> events, interplanetary shocks, {{and at the}} solar windtermination shock. By determining energy spectra, mass composition, and their temporal variationsin conjunction with other ACE instruments, ULEIS greatly improves our knowledge of solarabundances, {{as well as other}} reservoirs such as the local interstellar medium. ULEIS combines the high sensitivity required to measure low particle fluxes, along with the capability tooperate in the largest solar particle or interplanetary shock events. In addition to detailed informationfor individual ions, ULEIS features a wide range of count rates for different ions and energies that allows accurate determination of particle fluxes and anisotropies over short (few minutes) time scales.|$|E
5000|$|Ice cores {{containing}} thin nitrate-rich layers {{have been}} analysed to reconstruct {{a history of}} past solar storms predating reliable observations. It is claimed that data from Greenland ice cores show evidence of individual solar-proton events, including the Carrington event. More recent work by the ice core community shows that nitrate spikes are not a result of <b>solar</b> <b>energetic</b> <b>particle</b> events, and, indeed, no consistency is found in cores from Greenland and Antarctica, and nitrate events can be due to terrestrial events, such as burnings, so use of this technique is in doubt.

The onset in the solar wind was somewhat more gradual, beginning approximately two hours before the rather sudden onset in the <b>solar</b> <b>energetic</b> <b>particles.</b> The high iron charge states coincided approximately with the magnetic cloud associated with the CME. Later, during the cloud passage, periods of high and unusually low, iron ionization states were observed in the solar wind.

5000|$|The rate of 14C {{production}} can be modelled and {{is between}} 16,400 and 18,800 atoms 14C m−2s−1, which {{agrees with the}} global carbon budget {{that can be used}} to backtrack, but attempts to directly measure the production rate in situ were not very successful. Production rates vary because of changes to the cosmic ray flux caused by the heliospheric modulation (solar wind and solar magnetic field), and due to variations in the Earth's magnetic field. The latter can create significant variations in 14C production rates, although the changes of the carbon cycle can make these effects difficult to tease out.Occasional spikes may occur; for example, there is evidence for an unusually strong increase of the production rate in AD 774-775, caused by an extremesolar energetic particle event, strongest for the last ten millennia.

30|$|Aplin and Harrison ([2014]) {{describe}} three {{mechanisms by}} which a large solar storm can influence the atmospheric electricity. The first one is atmosphere ionization by <b>solar</b> <b>energetic</b> <b>particles</b> {{to the level of}} Earth's surface. The second type of atmospheric electrical response arises if the solar flare produces lower energy particles that enter the atmosphere but do not reach the surface. Under these circumstances, the global circuit would be modulated by decreasing the resistance of the air in the upper atmosphere, which would increase the conduction current between the ionosphere and the surface, in turn, and this would enhance the PG. The third mechanism takes place through the enhancement of lightning by <b>solar</b> <b>energetic</b> <b>particles,</b> which would cause increased current flow in the global circuit and, if local variations did not dominate, yield PG fluctuations.|$|R
