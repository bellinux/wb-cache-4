40|$|Abstract. - For a {{colloidal}} particle {{driven by}} a constant force across a periodic potential, we investigate the distribution of entropy production both experimentally and theoretically. For short trajectories, the fluctuation theorem holds experimentally. The mean entropy production rate shows two regimes {{as a function of}} the applied force. Theoretically, both mean and variance of the pronounced non-Gaussian distribution can be obtained from a differential equation in good agreement with the experimental data. Nonequilibrium steady states constitute arguably the simplest class of nonequilibrium systems. They are characterized by a stationary distribution but differ crucially from equilibrium states since detailed balance is broken. As a consequence, entropy is produced at an on average positive rate. Fluctuations of the entropy production towards negative values do occur but they are severely constrained by the fluctuation theorem. This universal relation was first observed in the simulations of a <b>sheare...</b>|$|E

40|$|Fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade students, repre-senting three classifications&mdash;intellectually gifted, {{learning}} disabled, and normal-achieving&mdash;were compared {{for their}} concep-tualizations, attributions, and attitudes about school grading practices. Significant {{differences were found}} among the three groups, particularly in ability to define grading systems and tenden-cies to perceive the causes for getting good grades as internal and controllable. Linear trends were found on these variables, with mean scores show-ing an increase from the learning-disabled, to the normal-achieving, to the gifted group. Results are {{discussed in terms of}} psychological theory and issues for educational practice. Formal evaluation, represented by marking or grading students, is among the most salient experiences of school life. It has been characterized as &dquo;the basic currency of our educational system&dquo; (Deutsch, 1979) and as a major problem area in school (Dellow, Ross, & James, 1980; Mitchell, 1983). Despite the importance of grades, comparatively little research has been done on students ’ attitudes and understandings of grading. Rather, researchers have focused on teachers ’ at-titudes and viewpoints on grading (Rogers, 1982; Salvia, Algozzine, & <b>Sheare,</b> 1977) and students ’ perceptions of teachers ’ attitudes toward grades (Raviv...|$|E
40|$|The linear {{stability}} {{analysis of}} an uniform shear flow of granular materials is revisited using several cases of a Navier-Stokes’-level constitutive {{model in which}} we incorporate the global equation of states for pressure and thermal conductivity (which are accurate up-to the maximum packing density νm) and the shear viscosity is allowed to diverge at a density νµ (< νm), with all other transport coefficients diverging at νm. It is shown that the emergence of shear-banding instabilities (for perturbations having no variation along the streamwise direction), that lead to shear-band formation along the gradient direction, depends crucially on {{the choice of the}} constitutive model. In the framework of a dense constitutive model that incorporates only collisional transport mechanism, it is shown that an accurate global equation of state for pressure or a viscosity divergence at a lower density or a stronger viscosity divergence (with other transport coefficients being given by respective Enskog values that diverge at νm) can induce shear-banding instabilities, even though the original dense Enskog model is stable to such shear-banding instabilities. For any constitutive model, the onset of this shear-banding instability is tied to a universal criterion in terms of constitutive relations for viscosity and pressure, and the <b>sheare...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Lusatian Fault in the {{northern}} Bohemian Massif {{is one of the}} most prominent products of the latest Cretaceous to Paleogene thrusting in the Alpine foreland in Europe. Its fault plane dips to the N to NE, typically separating crystalline units in the N from Upper Paleozoic and Cretaceous units in the south. Crystalline units in Lusatia consist of Proterozoic to Lower Paleozoic rocks epi- to mesozonally metamorphosed during the Variscan Orogeny, cut by Cadomian and Variscan granitoid plutons. Anatomy of the fault was studied in outcrops and in a series of test trenches, and the course of fault trace in complex topography was used to determine the dip of the fault. Based on a detailed analysis of brittle structures accompanying the main fault, the Lusatian Fault Belt can be further subdivided into the fault core, zone of wall-rock brecciation, and the damage zone which also includes large-scale dismembered blocks and flanking structures. Other components of the fault belt originated in spatial association with the Lusatian Fault, during its formation (e. g., the drag zone and bedding-plane slips in the footwall-block sediments) or later, during its multi-stage evolution. A general dependence of fault belt architecture on the orientation of the fault plane to the acting stress can be demonstrated. With the NNE–SSW subhorizontal maximum principal stress calculated for the thrusting episode at the Lusatian Fault, less complex structures appear where the dip of the fault is shallower, and more complex structures including thicker damage zone and drag zone were formed where the fault was steeper. In flat fault segments, competent members of the footwall-block sedimentary package, whose bedding planes were sub-conformable to the fault plane, were <b>sheare...</b>|$|E
