40|$|An astrophysical MASER (Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is {{a source}} of stimulated {{spectral}} line emission. Maser emission is observed from the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars, molecular clouds/star-forming regions, active galactic nuclei, supernova remnants, comets, and the Saturnian moons. It arises from molecules such as water (H 2 O), hydroxyl radicals (OH), methanol (CH 3 OH), formaldehyde (CH 2 O), silicon monoxide (SiO), ammonia (NH 3), <b>silicon</b> <b>sulphide</b> (SiS), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and from atomic hydrogen recombination lines. Masers are compact, of high brightness temperature, and often display narrow spectral line widths, polarized emission and variability. Free electron-cyclotron astrophysical masers additionally exist.

50|$|Mineral {{water of}} Separeva banya was highly {{regarded}} {{and used as}} a cure by Thracians and Romans. Saparevian mineral water is clear, colorless, with smell of hydrogen sulfide, hyperthermal (temperature 103 Â°C), hydrocarbonate, sulphate-sodium, fluorine, <b>silicon</b> and <b>sulphide.</b> Hydrogen sulfide is 15,5 mg / L. It is claimed that the water treats disorders of the musculoskeletal system, nervous system, and upper respiratory tract, and metal poisoning.|$|R

[...] The {{first one was}} the Adisseo Group, a global animal nutrition feed firm that specialized in producing methionine, vitamins and biological enzymes. At {{the time of the}} purchase, Adisseo had worldwide market share of 30% in methionine. [...] The other company was the organic <b>silicon</b> and <b>sulphide</b> business of Rhodia. [...] With this acquisition the company became the third largest producer in the world of organic silicon.|$|R
40|$|The {{semiconductor}} {{films of}} amorphous <b>silicon,</b> cadmium <b>sulphide,</b> selenide and telluride and also copper-indium diselenide have been investigated. The {{aim is to}} develop the production process of semiconductor films for cascade photoelectric converters. The mathematical model of amorphous silicon precipitation process and physical model of the intercrystallite layer in the films with different conductivity type have been proposed. The design of tandem solar element, design of working chambers for making the active thin-film structures of photoelectric converters, passivation methods of intercrystallite boundaries in glow discharge plasma and method of making copper-indium diselenide layers have been developed. The chamber for making active structures of the solar cells has been developed and made. The limited parnership "Gelion" has started to master {{the production of the}} new article: thin-film solar cellsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{formation}} of molecular precursors to dust in the ejecta of Population III supernovae using a chemical kinetic approach. Our work focuses on zero-metallicity 20 Msun and 170 Msun progenitors, and we consider fully-macroscopically mixed and unmixed ejecta. The nucleation stage for small silica, metal oxides and sulphides, pure metal, and carbon clusters is described with a new chemical reaction network. We consider {{the effect of the}} pressure dependence of critical nucleation rates, and test the impact of microscopically-mixed He+ on carbon dust formation. The unmixed ejecta of a 170 Msun progenitor supernova synthesizes ~ 5. 6 Msun of small clusters, while its 20 Msun counterpart produces ~ 0. 103 Msun. Our results point to smaller amounts of dust formed in the ejecta of Pop. III supernovae by a factor ~ 5 compared to values derived by previous studies, and to different dust chemical composition. Such deviations result from some erroneous assumptions made, the inappropriate use of classical nucleation theory to model dust formation, and the omission of the synthethis of molecules in supernova ejecta. Unmixed ejecta of massive Pop. III supernovae chiefly form silica and/or silicates, and pure silicon grains whereas their lower mass counterparts form a dust mixture dominated by silica and/or silicates, pure <b>silicon</b> and iron <b>sulphides.</b> Amorphous carbon can only condense in ejecta where the carbon-rich zone is deprived of He+. The first dust enrichment to the primordial gas in the early universe from Pop. III massive supernova comprises primarily pure silicon, silica and silicates. If carbon dust is present at redshift z> 6, alternative dust sources must be considered. Comment: 59 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
