40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of desynchronising modular syn-chronous specications for their realisation into GALS architectures and obtaining simple wrappers that are eciently synthesisable using exist-ing synthesis tools. The systems are modeled using Petri nets (PN) and the desynchronisation technique {{is based on the}} theory of PN Localities. The ring semantics of a globally synchronous system is characterised by maximal ring of input and output transitions. The partitioning of a synchronous system is achieved by unbundling the input transitions and allowing the output transitions to re in maximal steps, in order to enable asynchronous communication in a distributed environment. Our model satises the two essential correctness properties, namely, seman-tics preservation and deadlock prevention, during the shift from maximal ring semantics, followed by synchronous systems, to standard interleav-ing semantics for input transitions and maximal <b>step</b> <b>ring</b> semantics for output transitions, followed by GALS architectures. The formation of localities is supported by adding internal signals which are necessary for building wrappers in the localities that will generate local clock enables. These wrappers can be subsequently synthesised using PN based synthesis tools. ...|$|E

Styryl lactones are the most interesting {{members of this group}} of naturally available compounds. One of the well-known and important example for styryl lactone is goniothalamin, which shows cytotoxicity against variety of cancer cell lines. This cytotoxic property was shown to be selective for cancer cell lines with no significant cytotoxicity toward non-malignant cells. Recent structure activity relationship (SAR) studies on goniothalamin shows that R configuration on its stereogenic center, trans double bonded linker and Michael acceptor parts of the molecules are essential for its cytotoxic activity. In this study conformationally constrained analogues of (S) - and (R) -goniothalamin were synthesized.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} an experimentally validated modelling {{study of the}} flow of combustion air in an industrial radiant tube burner (RTB). The RTB is used typically in industrial heat treating furnaces. The work has been initiated because of the need for improvements in burner lifetime and performance which are related to the fluid mechanics of the com busting flow, and a fundamental understanding of this is therefore necessary. To achieve this, a detailed three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model has been used, validated with experimental air flow, temperature and flue gas measurements. Initially, the work programme is presented and the theory behind RTB design and operation in addition to the theory behind swirling flows and methane combustion. NOx reduction techniques are discussed and numerical modelling of combusting flows is detailed in this section. The importance of turbulence, radiation and combustion modelling is highlighted, as well as the numerical schemes that incorporate discretization, finite volume theory and convergence. The study first focuses on the combustion air flow and its delivery to the combustion zone. An isothermal computational model was developed to allow the examination of the flow characteristics as it enters the burner and progresses through the various sections prior to the discharge face in the combustion area. Important features identified include the air recuperator swirler coil, the <b>step</b> <b>ring,</b> the primary/secondary air splitting flame tube and the fuel nozzle. It was revealed that the effectiveness of the air recuperator swirler is significantly compromised by the need for a generous assembly tolerance. Also, there is a substantial circumferential flow maldistribution introduced by the swirier, but that this is effectively removed by the positioning of a ring constriction in the downstream passage. Computations using the k-ε turbulence model show good agreement with experimentally measured velocity profiles in the combustion zone and proved the use of the modelling strategy prior to the combustion study. Reasonable mesh independence was obtained with 200, 000 nodes. Agreement was poorer with the RNG  k-ε and Reynolds Stress models. The study continues to address the combustion process itself and the heat transfer process internal to the RTB. A series of combustion and radiation model configurations were developed and the optimum combination of the Eddy Dissipation (ED) combustion model and the Discrete Transfer (DT) radiation model was used successfully to validate a burner experimental test. The previously cold flow validated k-ε turbulence model was used and reasonable mesh independence was obtained with 300, 000 nodes. The combination showed good agreement with temperature measurements in the inner and outer walls of the burner, as well as with flue gas composition measured at the exhaust. The inner tube wall temperature predictions validated the experimental measurements in the largest portion of the thermocouple locations, highlighting a small flame bias to one side, although the model slightly over predicts the temperatures towards the downstream end of the inner tube. NOx emissions were initially over predicted, however, the use of a combustion flame temperature limiting subroutine allowed convergence to the experimental value of 451 ppmv. With the validated model, the effectiveness of certain RTB features identified previously is analysed, and an analysis of the energy transfers throughout the burner is presented, to identify the dominant mechanisms in each region. The optimum turbulence-combustion-radiation model selection was then the baseline for further model development. One of these models, an eccentrically positioned flame tube model highlights the failure mode of the RTB during long term operation. Other models were developed to address NOx reduction and improvement of the flame profile in the burner combustion zone. These included a modified fuel nozzle design, with 12 circular section fuel ports, which demonstrates a longer and more symmetric flame, although with limited success in NOx reduction. In addition, a zero bypass swirler coil model was developed that highlights the effect of the stronger swirling combustion flow. A reduced diameter and a 20 mm forward displaced flame tube model shows limited success in NOx reduction; although the latter demonstrated improvements in the discharge face heat distribution and improvements in the flame symmetry. Finally, Flue Gas Recirculation (FGR) modelling attempts indicate the difficulty of the application of this NOx reduction technique in the Wellman RTB. Recommendations for further work are made that include design mitigations for the fuel nozzle and further burner modelling is suggested to improve computational validation. The introduction of fuel staging is proposed, as well as a modification in the inner tube to enhance the effect of FGR...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{preparation}} of novel functional (co) polyesters and copolyester resins based on e-caprolactone and functional e-caprolactones as well as (co) polyesters based on w-pentadecalactone and functional macrocyclic lactones or functional e-caprolactones. The characteristics of these polyesters were evaluated {{with respect to their}} molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, composition, microstructure, and concentration of the functional groups. The degradation of polyester resins obtained via photo-crosslinking and via Michael addition was studied as a function of crosslink density. Microstructured materials with tunable degradation rate suitable for drug delivery carriers were prepared and characterized. All functional e-caprolactones used in this thesis are g-acyloxy-e-caprolactones which were prepared in two steps starting from 4 -hydroxy-cyclohexanone. In the first step acylation of the hydroxyl group occurs and in the second <b>step</b> <b>ring</b> enlargement by Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. If the reaction sequence is inverted rearrangement occurs in the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of 4 -hydroxy cyclohexanone leading to g-hydroxyethyl-g-butyrolactone. Using the first procedure g-acetyloxy- (AcetCL), g-benzoyloxy- (BenzCL), g-acryloyloxy- (AcrCL), and g- methacryloyloxy-e-caprolactone (McrCL) were prepared. These monomers and for comparison reasons e-caprolactone and g-methyl-e-caprolactone were polymerized by means of chemical and enzymatic catalysis. The functional repeating units in copolyesters obtained from e-caprolactone and g-acyloxy-e-caprolactones change the crystallinity of the copolyester, in case of AcrCL and McrCL are used for the preparation of copolyester resins and the preparation of microstructured surfaces. It is expected that the rate of degradation of these polymers can be finely tuned {{by the nature of the}} acyl group and the concentration of the g-acyloxy-e-caprolactone repeating units. The expectation is based on the fact that the hydrolysis of the ester side chains or thermal treatment of the polymers releases the corresponding acid from the respective acyloxy side chain, which serves as a catalyst for further degradation (biotic acid generator). Copolymerization of e-caprolactone with g-acyloxy-e-caprolactones was performed using chemical and enzymatic catalysis. All monomers, except AcetCL, undergo controlled ringopening polymerization using chemical catalysts such as aluminium isopropoxide under selected reaction conditions. AcetCL, however, rearranges to a large extent under all polymerization conditions to give g-acetyloxyethyl-g-butyrolactone. In the presence of an enzyme (Novozyme 435, Lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) immobilized on a macroporous resin) all g-acyloxy-e-caprolactones, except BenzCL, partly rearrange to result in the corresponding g-acyloxy-g-butyrolactones, while e-caprolactone (CL) and g-methyl-e- caprolactone yield the corresponding polymers, the latter even in a stereoselective manner as reported earlier in the literature. This is the first time that rearrangement during polymerization was observed. A molecular dynamic study was performed with AcetCL and BenzCL as tetrahedral intermediates in the active-site of CALB to get information on the substrate recognition displayed by the enzyme. Based on the experimental results and the molecular dynamic studies a mechanism for the chemically and enzymatically catalyzed reactions of g-acyloxy-e-caprolactones was proposed. Novel biodegradable polyester resins were prepared via photo-crosslinking of functional polyesters obtained by copolymerization of CL with AcrCL and McrCL. Copolymers with different content of either acryloyloxy or methacryloyloxy functional groups were synthesized via ring-opening polymerization of g-acyloyloxy-e-caprolactones and CL using Al(OiPr) 3 as catalyst and initiator. 2 D- and 3 D-micropatterning of the copolymers was performed via UVcrosslinking of polymer films on a suitable substrate by UV replica moulding on both rigid and elastic masters, showing the processability of these novel functional polyesters and their potential as substrates for biomedical devices. Degradation experiments on the polyester resins obtained via photo-crosslinking of methacryloyloxy and diamine-crosslinking of acryloyloxy pendant groups were performed. The presence of the functional groups affects the degradation rate of the copolymer: the degradation rate being faster with a higher degree of functionalization. Polyesters consisting of a poly(e-caprolactone) backbone bearing pendant acryloyloxy and methacryloyloxy groups in different amounts were successfully used also in preparation of biodegradable microparticle drug carriers. Stable microparticles can be prepared via an oil/water emulsion-solvent evaporation technique if polymers with up to 8 % acryloyloxy groups are used. If higher amounts of pendant groups are present the emulsion solvent evaporation technique is combined with a simultaneous crosslinking procedure to confer stability to the particles. We were successful in obtaining crosslinked particles with two different methods: UV irradiation in the presence of a photoinitiator and Michael type addition with diamines. Encapsulation of a hydrophobic fluorescent dye and a hydrophilic protein, as model drugs, were performed and confirmed by optical microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The presence of the functional groups allow not only for tunable degradability, but also for further processing (e. g. crosslinking) and (bio) functionalization, broadening the potential use of polycaprolactones in biomedical applications. Poly(pentadecalactone) (PPDL) is a polyester of high crystallinity, with a melting point around 95 °C. PPDL is nontoxic and although a polyester, shows no hydrolytic enzyme catalyzed degradation. This is ascribed to the high crystallinity and hydrophobicity of the materials. In order to enhance the degradability of PPDL copolymerization of PDL with g-acyloyloxy-e- caprolactones monomers were performed via enzymatic catalysis. It is expected that by integration of functional pendant groups, as acid generators, along the PPDL backbone degradability can be tailored. It was observed that by using AcetCL and AcrCL as comonomers, no copolymers were obtained; the result of the copolymerization was PPDL and rearranged AcetCL and AcrCL. Using McrCL and BenzCL as comonomers random copolyesters were obtained and no rearrangement was observed. Gas chromatographic analysis using chiral columns of non converted monomer during copolymerization of BenzCL and PDL revealed that one of the enantiomeric monomers is preferentially consumed. As a consequence optical active copolyester are obtained. Copolymerization of PDL with CL and BenzCL leads to nearly quantitative monomer conversion affording PDL based polyesters which are expected to show an enhanced degradation rate. Copolymerization of PDL with functional macrolactones represents another versatile and straightforward method to introduce functionalities along the PPDL backbone. Pentadecalactone based copolymers with C,C-double bonds, epoxide rings and amide functional groups in the backbone were obtained by copolymerizing PDL with ambrettolide, ambrettolide epoxide and a cyclic ester amide. It is expected that by reducing the crystallinity of the copolymers an enhanced degradation rate will be observed...|$|E
