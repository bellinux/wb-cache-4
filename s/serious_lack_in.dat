Accordingly, considerable effort has been spent on understanding how spatial cognition is realized in the human mind. These endeavors have, however, so far virtually neglected one important aspect of spatial cognition, namely control. In this contribution we show that neglecting control constitutes a <b>serious</b> <b>lack</b> <b>in</b> understanding spatial cognition. Moreover, we propose conceptions for computational cognitive models including control for two particular spatial cognition tasks. Besides constituting first approaches to integrating control and spatial cognition these models potentially allow giving a more detailed account of the respective spatial cognition phenomena than currently available theories...|$|E

40|$|Remediation of a <b>serious</b> <b>lack</b> <b>in</b> {{reading fluency}} often {{takes the form}} of {{repeated}} reading exercises. The present study examines whether transfer of training effects to untrained (neighbour) words can be enhanced by training with an orthographic focus as compared with emphasising semantics. The effect of oral versus silent reading during training is studied as well. Two groups of reading-disabled children (mean age= 7 years, 11 months) were given repeated reading training with limited exposure duration (350 ms) in which 15 target words were repeated 20 times in exercises focused on either orthography (N= 26) or semantics (N= 25). The children were required to either read the target words aloud or perform the exercises silently, but this requirement appeared to have no effect on the training results. The results show that untrained neighbour words benefited more from training targets with an orthographic focus than from exercises with a semantic emphasis. © United Kingdom Literacy Association 2006...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} new ministerial dispositions {{on the high}} school’s {{teaching}} of Chemistry introducing the cross correlation of chemistry concepts and their distribution on the five years long course, the chemistry teaching still remains disjointed from both practise and contacts with real life in specific high schools (Scientific Licei), even though these latter are strictly devoted {{to the study of}} all the branches of Natural Sciences, and hence also of Chemical Sciences. As an example, while most of these schools possess a Physics lab, the Chemistry lab is generally absent. This discrimination can be attributed to many factors: 1) the Chemistry laboratory requires specific and very expensive safety structures, 2) the Chemistry laboratory can produce waste substances needing special disposal, 3) in this context the teachers do not possess specific skills, as they are generally graduated in different scientific disciplines. All these facts limit the Chemistry lab implementation and, even when present in the school, its practical use. The lack of a chemistry teaching method based on / or supported by practical experiences can be a <b>serious</b> <b>lack</b> <b>in</b> the learning process leading to students having poor motivations on the study of Chemistry and scarce attitude to acquire a correct understanding of matter composition and related transformations.

40|$|The {{training}} of (young) farmers {{to improve their}} professional skills is practically unknown in most African countries. This {{continues to be a}} <b>serious</b> <b>lack</b> <b>in</b> a continent still dependent on its agriculture to both feed itself and to generate income from exports of primary produce. Even where there is training or education of farmers, it is often theoretical and lacks the practical application which farmers need if they are to respond to and implement improved techniques. To help make good this lack CTA sponsored a study visit by eleven senior African agricultural trainers who are involved in or have influence on agricultural education and training in their countries. The participants came from Ghana, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Between 18 th September and 3 rd October, 1992 they were able to visit three agricultural training schools in the EEC. These were chosen for their special know-how in the management of programmes in which practical work, based on the philosophy: You hear, you forget; You see, you remember; You do, you understand, dominates. They are also schools where the motivation and determination of staff {{is an important factor in}} the transfer of knowledge from the trainer to the student. The three schools selected were the American Farm School at Thessaloniki, which has contributed to remarkable progress in Greek agriculture; the Deula Training Centre for Agricultural Engineering in Germany, which for more than 60 years has been related to problem solving in rural development through professional training; and the Institute of Practical Engineering at Ede, which was founded in 1954 and for nearly 40 years has influenced Dutch agriculture by the development of new and better implements and tractors. The study tour was coordinated by Deutsche Landwirtschafts Gesellschaft/German Society for Agriculture (DLG). The participants gained a good overview of the role of practical training. The activities, enthusiasm and commitment found at the three schools, together with the obvious achievements after sometimes humble beginnings, stimulated most of the participants to consider starting something similar at home. They agreed that curriculum development should be based on what is to be found and what is needed in the country, and that farmers organizations of all kinds should be approached for cooperation and input of relevant topics. It was also felt that much more attention must be paid to the role of women in agriculture, since they carry the heaviest burden of farm work, and that the deep involvement of women must be clearly reflected in the corresponding training programmes and in defining the target groups. It was recognized that one of the most important prerequisites for successful practical training is the well-being of African farmers. This is not just restricted to their economic situation, which may be improved by better prices, better roads and more support in the marketing of products. What is most essential is the social recognition of their position and their work.

However, positive changes in the {{construction industry}} call for a re-assessment of this situation. This study looked into the evolution of the construction industry and the strategies that have been adopted to increase youth participation in the construction workforce. Archival data from the Labor Force Survey Report was compiled to determine the trend of youth participation in the construction workforce. The findings indicate that local youth participation has never exceeded 25 % of the total construction workforce. An extensive survey was also carried out on youth at vocational training centers to determine their current perception of a career in the construction industry especially in construction sites. Surprisingly, the findings of the survey found that 3 ’D (difficult, dangerous and dirty) image is no longer a main factor in distracting local youth from pursuing career in the construction workforce. The main reasons however was found to be lack of encouragement from parents, the abundant presence of foreign workers at construction sites and unattractive wages. The survey also showed that youth are more attracted to the training centers providing non-construction related training programs which provide better facilities and allowances. Construction industry experts were also interviewed to obtain an insight on what went wrong with the previous and current initiatives to attract youth into the construction industry and how things can be done better.

Changing electric load and higher power transfer {{in a wide}} interconnected network leads to <b>serious,</b> security <b>lack</b> <b>in</b> power system operation. As energy storage appears to be beneficial to utilities since it can co-ordinate the instantaneous balance between demand and supply. Today, there is a demand for short term energy storage devices like flywheel energy storage, photovoltaic modules, battery energy storage and super capacitors. Since they are having less power and energy rating, they cannot be used for high power applications. So {{in order to minimize}} this problem, SMES has been used to improve power system performance as well as power quality as it has having high power rating with maximum efficiency. Super conducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) based dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) is introduced to protect consumers from the grid voltage fluctuations. In normal DVR based compensation, downstream fault current was not considered or the DVR was bypassed during that fault. But here along with voltage sag compensation, downstream fault current mitigation was also considered. Using MATLAB, the SMES based DVR is modelled, and the simulation tests are carried out to evaluate the system performance.
