40|$|The Brillouin light {{scattering}} analysis of stepped films opens up new {{possibilities for the}} determi-nation of the stiffness tensor, and it allows the reliable proof of the variation of microstructure {{as a function of}} the distance from the interface as well as its quantitative description. An alteration of microstructure with growing film thickness is a frequently observed phenomenon, especially for hard coatings. Prominent examples are boron nitride coatings [1]. Investigations of amorphous carbon films also clearly document such a behavior [2]. Our earlier work indicated that it would be useful to study films of several thicknesses on a common substrate. For this purpose we have modified our sputtering apparatus so that the substrate can be moved behind a <b>shielding</b> <b>window.</b> This technique allows the preparation of stepped films with steps typically 1 mm wide. Stepped tungsten carbide films were deposited on silicon by magnetron sputtering of a WC target and simultaneous ion plating. Special care was given to precisely fix the electrical potentials in the vicinity of the silicon substrate in order to achieve constant particle flux and energy which are homogeneous over the sample area for the complete deposition run. This preparation tech-nique consequently avoids typical sources of error which may occur when depositing several sin...|$|E
40|$|At the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS), the D&D task is enormous. Tons of {{plutonium}} has been processed {{over the years}} in approximately 1, 000 gloveboxes, This represents nearly half of the gloveboxes in the DOE complex. In addition, more than a thousand tanks of various designs, with miles of associated piping, supported the processes. A wide variety of operations were performed at RFETS, including aqueous processing, pyrophoric processing, hydriding and dehydriding, metal casting, and machining {{of plutonium}}. Various materials have been handled at the facility, including plutonium, uranium, americium, tantalum, beryllium, chloride salts, and various acids and solvents. Significant amounts of plutonium residues remain in inaccessible equipment in the facilities, which create criticality safety issues. Some of the plutonium has been at RFETS for many years, and there is significant in-growth of americium, a decay product that emits gamma radiation, which potentially increases exposure to the workers. The size reduction portion of the D&D will be difficult and costly. The gloveboxes and tanks are constructed of stainless steel, frequently with lead shielding or double walls that hold water for neutron <b>shielding.</b> <b>Window</b> mountings, glove port rings, site gages, bolted flanges, and various penetrations reinforce the walls. Tanks may be filled with berated glass rings for criticality control, or double walled to hold the process fluid in the space between walls. The gloveboxes and tanks are generally tall enough to require workers to stand on scaffolding or platforms to perform D&D. Gloveboxes and tanks were individually constructed over a span of many years with evolving design specifications; therefore, most gloveboxes are unique and few tank designs are duplicated in more than pairs. This paper describes the cultural transition and technical approaches taken for D&D at RFETS to achieve 2006 closure. Specific emphasis is placed on critical issues such as, workforce safety and retention, strategies for schedule acceleration, and technological breakthroughs for D&D of nuclear facilities...|$|E

40|$|A simple {{differential}} {{capacitive sensor}} {{is provided in}} this paper to measure the absolute positions of length measuring systems. By utilizing a <b>shield</b> <b>window</b> inside the differential capacitor, the measurement range and linearity range of the sensor can reach several millimeters. What is more interesting is that this differential capacitive sensor is only sensitive to one translational degree of freedom (DOF) movement, and immune to the vibration along the other two translational DOFs. In the experiment, we used a novel circuit based on an AC capacitance bridge to directly measure the differential capacitance value. The experimental result shows that this differential capacitive sensor has a sensitivity of 2 × 10 − 4 pF/μm with 0. 08 μm resolution. The measurement range of this differential capacitive sensor is 6 mm, and the linearity error are less than 0. 01 % over the whole absolute position measurement range...|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} of the building is characterized by deeply folded brick walls created {{by a series of}} thin, two-story light hoods that help <b>shield</b> <b>windows</b> from direct sunlight. Between the light hoods on the ground floor are projections of the building that enclose bench seats in the interior. Small windows {{on each side of the}} bench seats allow additional indirect light into the rooms. These projections impart a dual character to the light hoods, giving the upper part of each the appearance of an object, a light hood, and the lower part the appearance of a void, the space between two projections. The light hoods create a series of shadows on the exterior wall that are reminiscent of a row of columns, their vertical lines adding to the impression of height.

40|$|A {{design of}} a {{shielded}} medical room {{to be used in}} Boron Neutron Capture Therapy was developed. The design included analytical shielding calculations, computational methods using the Monte Carlo N-particle transport code, and experimental measurements using the current medical room. The design included the shielded wall of the medical room, a shielding door for entrance into the room, a viewing window, and patient positioning system. From the shielding analysis the amount of high density concrete needed to reduce the dose rate outside the walls of the room to 1 mrem/hr was calculated. The side walls and ceiling need 73 cm of Ilmenite I- 2 a concrete and the back wall needs 100 cm. Several options were proposed for the shielding material needed to fabricate the door. The most desirable option is 45 cm all steel door. A <b>shielded</b> <b>window</b> composed of 30 cm of mineral oil, 40 cm of lead glass with density of 3. 95, and 28 cm of plain glass will provide sufficient shielding.

40|$|This {{software}} implements penetration limit equations {{for common}} micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) <b>shield</b> configurations, <b>windows,</b> and thermal protection systems. Allowable MMOD risk is formulated {{in terms of}} the probability of penetration (PNP) of the spacecraft pressure hull. For calculating the risk, spacecraft geometry models, mission profiles, debris environment models, and penetration limit equations for installed shielding configurations are required. Risk assessment software such as NASA's BUMPERII is used to calculate mission PNP; however, they are unsuitable for use in shield design and preliminary analysis studies. The software defines a single equation for the design and performance evaluation of common MMOD <b>shielding</b> configurations, <b>windows,</b> and thermal protection systems, along with a description of their validity range and guidelines for their application. Recommendations are based on preliminary reviews of fundamental assumptions, and accuracy in predicting experimental impact test results.

40|$|Many {{buildings}} in the extensive oeuvre of the architect Brian Allen Theodor Sandrock (1925 - 1990) and his ‘right hand man’ Alewyn Petrus Burger (1933 -) are iconic symbols of apartheid modernity. Their Modern Movement buildings are located mainly on the campuses of the University of Pretoria (UP) and the University of South Africa (Unisa). To date, information on these buildings has not been collated in one document and more complete biographies of Sandrock and Burger have also not been compiled. The aim of this ‘work in progress’ survey is to begin to fill the information-vacuum on the development plans and buildings designed by Brian Sandrock Architects. The survey is a step towards {{the establishment of a}} comprehensive record of Sandrock and Burger’s work, as well as the compilation of their respective biographies. In conclusion, key aspects of buildings designed by Brian Sandrock Architects are identified and outlined, such as the firm’s love of tall buildings; its preference for elevating buildings on columns; its inconsistent approach to <b>shielding</b> <b>windows</b> from the sun’s rays, and the firm’s experimentation with the integration of Brutalism and the International Style at Unisa’s Muckleneuk campus.
