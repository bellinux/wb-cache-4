5|$|To {{reduce the}} storage {{footprint}} {{of the operating}} system, Windows 10 automatically compresses <b>system</b> <b>files.</b> The system can reduce the storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5GB for 32-bit systems and 2.6GB for 64-bit systems. The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by OEMs, which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance. Furthermore, the Refresh and Reset functions use runtime <b>system</b> <b>files</b> instead, making a separate recovery partition redundant, allowing patches and updates to remain installed following the operation, and further {{reducing the amount of}} space required for Windows 10 by up to 12GB. These functions replace the WIMBoot mode introduced on Windows 8.1 Update, which allowed OEMs to configure low-capacity devices with flash-based storage to use Windows <b>system</b> <b>files</b> out of the compressed WIM image typically used for installation and recovery. Windows 10 also includes a function in its Settings app that allows users to view a breakdown of how their device's storage capacity is being used by different types of files, and determine whether certain types of files are saved to internal storage or an SD card by default.|$|E

40|$|From its inception, UNIX {{has been}} built around two {{fundamental}} entities: processes and files. In this chapter, {{we look at the}} implementation of files in Solaris and discuss the framework for <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> 14. 1 <b>File</b> <b>System</b> Framework Solaris OS includes a framework, the virtual <b>file</b> <b>system</b> framework, under which multiple <b>file</b> <b>system</b> types are implemented. Earlier implementations of UNIX used a single <b>file</b> <b>system</b> type for all of the mounted <b>file</b> <b>systems,</b> typically, the UFS <b>file</b> <b>system</b> from BSD UNIX. The virtual <b>file</b> <b>system</b> framework was developed to allow Sun’s distributed computing <b>file</b> <b>system</b> (NFS) to coexist with the UFS <b>file</b> <b>system</b> in SunOS 2. 0; it became a standard part of System V in SVR 4 and Solaris OS. We can categorize Solaris <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> into the following types: Storage-based. Regular <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> that provide facilities for persistent storage and management of data. The Solaris UFS and PC/DOS <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> are examples. Network <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>File</b> <b>systems</b> that provide <b>files</b> that are accessible in a local directory structure but are stored on a remote network server; for example, NFS. Pseudo <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>File</b> <b>systems</b> that present various abstractions as files in a <b>file</b> <b>system.</b> The /proc pseudo <b>file</b> <b>system</b> represents the address space of a process as a series of files. 657 658 Chapter 14 <b>File</b> <b>System</b> Framework The framework provides a single set of well-defined interfaces that are <b>file</b> <b>system</b> independent; the implementation details of each <b>file</b> <b>system</b> are hidden behind these interfaces. Two key objects represent these interfaces: the virtual file, or vnode, and the virtual <b>file</b> <b>system,</b> or vfs objects. The vnode interfaces implement file-related functions, and the vfs interfaces implement <b>file</b> <b>system</b> management functions. The vnode and vfs interfaces direct functions to specific <b>file</b> <b>systems,</b> {{depending on the type of}} <b>file</b> <b>system</b> being operated on. Figure 14. 1 shows the <b>file</b> <b>system</b> layers. File-related functions are initiated through a system call or from another kernel subsystem and are directed to the appropriate <b>file</b> <b>system</b> by the vnode/vfs layer...|$|R

25|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of a {{vulnerability}} or misconfiguration allowing privilege escalation, many programs have been written or adapted to make use of privilege separation, privilege revocation and chrooting. Privilege separation is a technique, pioneered on OpenBSD and inspired by the principle of least privilege, where a program is split into two or more parts, one of which performs privileged operations and the other—almost always the bulk of the code—runs without privilege. Privilege revocation is similar and involves a program performing any necessary operations with the privileges it starts with then dropping them. Chrooting involves restricting an application to one section of the file system, prohibiting it from accessing areas that contain private or <b>system</b> <b>files.</b> Developers have applied these features to OpenBSD versions of many common applications, such as tcpdump, file, tmux, smtpd, and syslogd.|$|E
25|$|Version 3.0 {{retained}} {{all of the}} functionality {{from previous}} versions and added new features and tools. Support for DirectX 8.1 and OpenGL was added, allowing Mac users to play some Windows games without the need to boot into Windows with Boot Camp. A new feature called SmartSelect offers cross OS file and application integration by allowing the user to open Windows files with Mac OS X programs and vice versa. Parallels Explorer was introduced, which allows the user to browse their Windows <b>system</b> <b>files</b> in Mac OS X without actually launching Windows. A new snapshot feature was included, allowing one to restore their virtual machine environment to a previous state in case of issues. Further, Parallels added a security manager to {{limit the amount of}} interaction between the Windows and Mac OS X installations. This version included a long-awaited complete “Parallels tools'” driver suite for Linux guest operating systems. Therefore, integration between Mac OS X and Linux guest-OS's has been greatly improved.|$|E

BitLocker was briefly called Secure Startup prior to Windows Vista being released to manufacturing.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} an architecture for extensible <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> The architecture enables {{the extension of}} <b>file</b> <b>system</b> functionality by composing (or stacking) new <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> on top of existing <b>file</b> <b>systems.</b> A <b>file</b> <b>system</b> that is stacked {{on top of an}} existing <b>file</b> <b>system</b> can access the existing <b>file</b> <b>system's</b> <b>files</b> via a well-defined naming interface and can share the same underlying file data in a coherent manner. We describe extending <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> {{in the context of the}} Spring operating <b>system.</b> Composing <b>file</b> <b>systems</b> in Spring is facilitated by basic Spring features such as its virtual memory architecture, its strongly-typed well-defined interfaces, its location-independent object invocation mechanism, and its flexible naming architecture. <b>File</b> <b>systems</b> in Spring can reside in the kernel, in user-mode, or on remote machines, and composing them can be done in a very flexible manner...|$|R
