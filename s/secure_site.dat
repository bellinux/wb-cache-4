25|$|Like {{many members}} of the family Sciuridae, the eastern gray {{squirrel}} is a scatter-hoarder; it hoards food in numerous small caches for later recovery. Some caches are quite temporary, especially those made near the site of a sudden abundance of food which can be retrieved within hours or days for reburial in a more <b>secure</b> <b>site.</b> Others are more permanent and are not retrieved until months later. Each squirrel is estimated to make several thousand caches each season. The squirrels have very accurate spatial memory for the locations of these caches, and use distant and nearby landmarks to retrieve them. Smell is used partly to uncover food caches, and also to find food in other squirrels' caches. Scent can be unreliable when the ground is too dry or covered in snow.|$|E

500|$|As in Norwich {{and other}} places, the castle {{was used as}} a <b>secure</b> <b>site</b> in which to {{establish}} a gaol (prison; jail). At Lincoln, the gaol was built in 1787 and extended in 1847 [...] the 1787 Governor's House and the 1847 Prison are now Grade II* heritage listed buildings. The old prison is a three storey stone building with 15 bays and is connected to the 18th-century Governor's House via a single storey prison chapel.|$|E
500|$|He knew Pemex had drilled {{exploratory}} {{wells in}} the region. In 1951, one bored {{into what was}} described as a thick layer of andesite about [...] down. This layer could have resulted from the intense heat and pressure of an Earth impact, but {{at the time of the}} borings it was dismissed as a lava dome—a feature uncharacteristic of the region's geology. Penfield tried to <b>secure</b> <b>site</b> samples, but was told such samples had been lost or destroyed. When attempts at returning to the drill sites and looking for rocks proved fruitless, Penfield abandoned his search, published his findings and returned to his Pemex work.|$|E
500|$|After {{aborting}} the raid, the Confederates retreated south towards Moorefield. McCausland {{believed that}} Averell {{was still in}} Hancock, and was therefore not an immediate threat. He selected camp sites suited for grazing horses instead of defense. Johnson's Brigade occupied {{the north side of}} the South Branch Potomac River, while McCausland's Brigade camped on the south shore. The camps were north of Moorefield and south of Romney, along the main north–south road between the two communities and closer to Moorefield. The route back to the Shenandoah Valley was east out of Moorefield along the Wardensville Road, which led to Wardensville and Winchester. McCausland established his headquarters at the Samuel McMechen home in Moorefield, leaving his brigade under the command of Colonel James A. Cochran from the 14th Virginia Cavalry. Horses were unsaddled and fed. Johnson made his headquarters closer to his brigade at a mansion named Willow Wall that was owned by the McNeill family. Each brigade had two pieces of artillery. Johnson kept several groups of pickets north of his camp along the main road. Captain John [...] "Hanse" [...] McNeill, leader of McNeill's Rangers that normally patrolled the area, recommended McCausland reposition the two brigades because he did not believe the camp sites were ideal for the security of the troops. His advice was disregarded, so he moved his Rangers to a more <b>secure</b> <b>site</b> about [...] away from McCausland.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2008, a New York Times article claimed, citing unnamed CIA officers, that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed {{was held}} in a secret {{facility}} in Poland near Szymany Airport, about [...] north of Warsaw {{and it was there}} where he was interrogated and the waterboarding was applied. It is claimed that waterboarding was used about 100 times over a period of two weeks before Khalid Sheikh Mohammed began to cooperate. In September 2008, two anonymous Polish intelligence officers made the claims about facilities being located in Poland in the Polish daily newspaper Dziennik. One of them stated that between 2002 and 2005 the CIA held terror suspects inside a military intelligence training base in Stare Kiejkuty in north-eastern Poland. The officer said only the CIA had access to the isolated zone, which was used because it was a <b>secure</b> <b>site</b> far from major towns and was close to a former military airport. Both Prime Minister Leszek Miller and President Aleksander Kwasniewski knew about the base, the newspaper reported. However, the officer said it was unlikely either man knew if the prisoners were being tortured because the Poles had no control over the Americans' activities. On January 23, 2009, The Guardian reported that the CIA had run black sites at Szymany Airport in Poland, Camp Eagle in Bosnia and Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo. The United States has refused to cooperate with a Polish investigation into the matter, according to the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights.|$|E
