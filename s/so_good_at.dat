25|$|Don Dale, Style Weekly (May 21, 2001) — Maury Chaykin {{makes an}} {{excellent}} Nero Wolfe in A new series based on Stout’s books. And Timothy Hutton is nicely cast as Goodwin. … The soundtrack {{of the series}} gets an A+: It’s full of hot '30s and '40s club jazz. So do the writers, especially for capturing the exquisite subtleties of the complex relationship between Wolfe and Goodwin, most often expressed in the conversational games they’re so fond of—and <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>at.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{about age}} ten, Iommi began working out and learned judo, karate, and later boxing {{as a means}} of {{protecting}} himself from the local gangs which congregated in his neighbourhood. He became <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> boxing that he envisioned a future as a bouncer in a nightclub, thus avoiding a career in a boring factory job. Iommi initially wanted to play the drums, but due to the excessive noise he chose the guitar instead as a teenager, after being inspired by the likes of Hank Marvin and The Shadows. He has always played guitar left-handed. After completing school, Iommi worked briefly as a plumber and later in a factory manufacturing rings. He states that at one point he worked in a music store but quit after being falsely accused of stealing.|$|E
25|$|The {{human eye}} {{is good at}} seeing small {{differences}} in brightness over a relatively large area, but not <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> distinguishing the exact strength of a high frequency brightness variation. This allows one to greatly {{reduce the amount of}} information in the high frequency components. This is done by simply dividing each component in the frequency domain by a constant for that component, and then rounding to the nearest integer. This rounding operation is the only lossy operation in the whole process (other than chroma subsampling) if the DCT computation is performed with sufficiently high precision. As a result of this, it is typically the case that many of the higher frequency components are rounded to zero, and many of the rest become small positive or negative numbers, which take many fewer bits to represent.|$|E

[...] On accepting the job, Elliott noted: [...] "It's difficult to leave a town where you’ve lived for 13 years (Ann Arbor, Michigan), but the opportunity is <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> Iowa with the people and the school that no one could pass it up." ...|$|E

Damon Lindelof was quoted in Variety as saying the character [...] "is going to bring a flavor to the show that doesn't exist right now. She's not as intense as some of the other characters.

500|$|After Beebo Brinker, Bannon {{said the}} energy {{to write about the}} {{characters}} left her, but she got <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> her [...] "obsessive fantasies" [...] that even after the books were written she continued to live internally, and suspected it affected her subsequent relationships. [...] "I realize now that I was in a sort of 'holding pattern,' a way of keeping my sanity intact while waiting for my children to grow up and the freedom door to open", she recalled. Returning to school, Bannon completed her master's degree at Sacramento State University and her doctorate in linguistics at Stanford University. She was an English professor at Sacramento State and later became associate dean of the School of Arts and Sciences—later the College of Arts and Letters.|$|E
500|$|Robert insisted, against Atlantic Records' initial wishes, {{that he and}} Dean {{produce the}} album together. This freed the band from the {{constraints}} of any outside producer's schedule. The recording process could then be intertwined with tour dates, which, Dean said, resulted in improved performances on the record. Dean admitted they had been spoiled by working with producer Brendan O'Brien on previous releases. [...] "I'm not <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> walking around the control room with a pen and clipboard in my hands, marking down what takes are the best. It's a lot of work.

[...] However, in {{an article about the}} songwriter and producer Benny Blanco, it is revealed {{that at least some of}} the band's songs, such as [...] "Moves like Jagger," [...] are the product of efforts by, or collaborations with, professional songwriters and producers.

[...] He said a few days later that both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against. His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President Dick Cheney, who said, [...] "I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me — they were so out of line, it almost struck me that there was some — Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess."

[...] Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said the episode included a good exploration of Michael and Pam's relationship; he said [...] "they're weirdly good together".

500|$|Swivel {{dedicated}} {{much time}} in getting the vocal sound right, which according to him is crucial while working with Beyoncé's music. He further explained, [...] "I only put a quick EQ on the vocal {{at the end of}} a recording session if I have been cutting her, but mixing is far more particular, so I spent a lot of time dialling in the perfect frequency." [...] For the delay throws in the verses on [...] "I Care", he sent it through a large hall reverb at 50 percent — half reverb, half clean — then through an Amp Farm plug‑in for the grittiness, and that then went through a quarter‑note delay. In the bridge, é matches the guitar solo vocally — that was doubled — and one of the vocal tracks has an Amp Farm on it to add to that grittiness. To do justice to the multitude of vocal tracks within the song, Swivel created a stereo field using some clever panning techniques and a Waves S1 Imager plug‑in. He said that it was worth noting that whenever he mixes a record, [...] "I hate hard‑panned L/R. To get the right width, I pan them all differently in pairs: 40/40, 60/60, 70/70, 80/80, 90/90, and OK, maybe one is 100/100, but this process is ultimately what creates the stereo field." [...] Swivel used Waves' SSL E‑Channel plug‑in to shape Beyoncé's lead vocal. He took a Waves S1 Imager and spread with that without isolating he width. He added that something is hard‑panned, it feels too isolated and also confuses the listener's ears. Swivel explained further, [...] "I like smooth sound, and with B that works fine as she’s <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> matching everything. I like a wall of background vocals. It's the best way of putting your vocal in every area of the stereo field: a wide sound, but you’ve still got something there in the middle." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{necessity}} of making choices, and therefore of interpretation, in translating (and {{in other fields}} of human endeavor) stems from the ambiguity that subjectively pervades the universe.

[...] Our brain is <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> comprehending language {{that we do not}} usually notice."
