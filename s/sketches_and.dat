5|$|As well as {{numerous}} stand-alone <b>sketches</b> <b>and</b> songs, the show also had many recurring items. Each show would open with Wood performing a stand-up comedy monologue, often using material {{she had already}} honed on her stage tours. Within the half-hours that followed, there were usually several fairly regular sketch items mixed in.|$|E
5|$|Eakins {{made several}} on-site oil <b>sketches</b> <b>and</b> {{photographic}} studies before painting The Swimming Hole. It is unknown whether the photographs were taken before the oil sketches were produced {{or vice versa}} (or, indeed, whether they were created on the same day).|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn was a {{fine and}} {{enthusiastic}} artist in pencil and watercolour, a skill which he used throughout his life for his own amusement {{and that of his}} friends. His enormous correspondence shows that he could also be a witty writer in German and English– sometimes accompanied by humorous <b>sketches</b> <b>and</b> cartoons in the text.|$|E

It also includes exclusive interviews with members of the production staff.|$|E
5|$|A magazine-sized 39-page {{book called}} pre-Clannad was {{published}} by SoftBank Creative on April 15, 2004. The book contained images from the visual novel, and short explanations of the characters, along with production <b>sketches</b> <b>and</b> concept drawings. A 160-page visual fan book {{was published by}} Enterbrain on October 12, 2004 which contained detailed story explanations, computer graphics, sheet music for the opening and ending themes, and interviews from the creators.

5|$|After the war, Moore {{returned}} to Melbourne, where he painted images from his Belsen <b>sketches</b> <b>and</b> photographs. They were exhibited commercially, {{but failed to}} sell. The Australian War Memorial initially rejected the material {{because it did not}} depict Australian soldiers; however it accepted them in 1969 when they were donated by Moore. In 201314 the Belsen images formed the basis of a year-long exhibition at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, which Moore himself visited at the invitation of the Memorial.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{made little}} impact on its first publication, the 1906 novel Love Among the Chickens {{contained}} what French calls the author's first original comic creation: Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge. The character, an amoral, bungling opportunist, is partly based on Wodehouse's Globe colleague Herbert Westbrook. The two collaborated between 1907 and 1913 on two books, two music hall <b>sketches,</b> <b>and</b> a play, Brother Alfred. Wodehouse {{would return to the}} character in short stories over the next six decades.|$|E
5|$|In Nuenen, Van Gogh {{focused on}} {{painting}} and drawing. Working outside and very quickly, he completed <b>sketches</b> <b>and</b> paintings of weavers and their cottages. From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter ten years his senior, joined {{him on his}} forays; {{she fell in love}} and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They wanted to marry, but neither side of their families were in favour. Margot was distraught and took an overdose of strychnine, but survived after Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital. On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{was not a}} {{prolific}} painter, {{but he was a}} most prolific draftsman, keeping journals full of small <b>sketches</b> <b>and</b> detailed drawings recording all manner of things that took his attention. As well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some of which can be identified as preparatory to particular works such as The Adoration of the Magi, The Virgin of the Rocks and The Last Supper.|$|E

5|$|Moore's {{early work}} {{is focused on}} direct carving, in which {{the form of the}} {{sculpture}} evolves as the artist repeatedly whittles away at the block. In the 1930s, Moore's transition into modernism paralleled that of Barbara Hepworth; the two exchanged new ideas with each other and several other artists then living in Hampstead. Moore made many preparatory <b>sketches</b> <b>and</b> drawings for each sculpture. Most of these sketchbooks have survived and provide insight into Moore's development. He placed great importance on drawing; in old age, when he had arthritis, he continued to draw.|$|E
5|$|Phipps {{is known}} for his study of The Armies of the First French Republic and the Rise of the Marshals of Napoleon I, a five volume set {{published}} posthumously from 1926–1939 by Oxford University Press. He also edited L.A. Fauvelet de Bourrienne's Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte, a three volume work published in 1885 and Madame Campan's The private life of Marie Antoinette, queen of France and Navarre; with <b>sketches</b> <b>and</b> anecdotes of the courts of Louis XVI, published in 1889.|$|E
5|$|Sinnock's {{sketches}} for {{the quarter}} eagle {{were sent to the}} Fine Arts Commission on February 27, 1926, and were forwarded to sculptor member Lorado Taft for his views. Moore sent his commission's approval to Grant on March 26, with several recommendations, including that the motto E Pluribus Unum, present on the obverse in Sinnock's <b>sketches,</b> <b>and</b> the sun's rays on the reverse, be omitted. The rays were not removed, and the motto was moved to the reverse. Approval of the models followed in April, again with minor suggestions.|$|E
40|$|This book is {{intended}} as an introductory textbook {{for students and}} as a reference book for designers {{working in the field}} of product designing and engineering product design and development. As such, it gives a description of the basic techniques for <b>sketching</b> <b>and</b> rendering of a product in mixed-media using pencil, pen, markers, and pastels which are versatile and faster to work with compared to water/poster colour and air brush. Topics such as Materials, Basic of Drawing, Shading, Colouring, <b>Sketching,</b> <b>and</b> Rendering with original samples of drawing are illustrated in order to show the step by step techniques of <b>sketching</b> <b>and</b> rendering. The basic aspects of perspectives, shading, and various types of colour surfaces, apart from using the right materials are fundamental and important applications in creating good drawings. This book aims at providing the reader with fast <b>sketching</b> <b>and</b> rendering methods ranging from simple basic geometrical shapes to consumer products...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} artists visited the newly {{returned}} Trafalgar ships, including John Livesay, drawing master at the Royal Naval Academy. Livesay produced several sketches of battle-damaged ships, {{sending them to}} Nicholas Pocock {{to be used for}} Pocock's large paintings of the battle. Temeraire was one of the ships he sketched. Another visitor to Portsmouth was J. M. W. Turner. It is not known whether he visited Temeraire, though he did go aboard Victory, making preparatory notes and <b>sketches</b> <b>and</b> interviewing sailors {{who had been in the}} battle. The story of the Temeraire had become firmly ingrained in the public mind, so much so that when the House of Commons passed a vote of thanks to the men who had fought at Trafalgar, only three were specifically named. Nelson, Collingwood, and Harvey of the Temeraire.|$|E
5|$|Cameron {{wanted his}} pitch for Daly to {{finalize}} {{the deal and}} had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator. Henriksen, wearing a leather jacket, fake cuts on his face, and gold foil on his teeth, kicked {{open the door to}} the office and then sat in a chair. Cameron arrived shortly after which relieved the staff from Henriksen's act. Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron's <b>sketches</b> <b>and</b> passion for the film. In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion. The Terminator was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million. Hemdale, Pacific Western Productions and Cinema '84 have been credited as production companies after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|Douglas {{published}} no {{writings of}} his own and left no records of his ideas and thoughts. The only publication with which he was associated was the Abbey Square Sketch Book, which he edited. The book appeared in three volumes, the first dated 1872 and the others undated; it consisted of <b>sketches</b> <b>and</b> drawings (with some photographs in the third volume) by many contributors. The pictures depicted buildings and furniture, mainly dating from the late medieval period and the 16th and 17thcenturies, and mostly from Cheshire and northwest England. Douglas's only contribution was a jointly ascribed plate in the third volume. It is likely that he designed the title pages, or at least the drawing incorporated in it, of the Abbey Gateway in Chester.|$|E
