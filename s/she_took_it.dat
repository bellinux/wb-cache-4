5|$|Born Kathy Petro, {{she grew}} up in a horse racing family from Massachusetts and married a fellow horseman, Tim Ritvo, in 1990. Kathy and Tim ran a race horse {{training}} operation in Florida, and In 2010 <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> over solo when Tim became part of the management of Gulfstream Park race track. Her accomplishments came against the backdrop of having been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 2001 and receiving a heart transplant in 2008. In spite of the medication regime and immunity issues that transplant recipients face, she lives a normal life as a horse trainer and shows no signs of organ rejection.|$|E

25|$|Though {{this period}} of Bourgeoys' life in New France pales in {{comparison}} to her later years in terms of expansionary scope and influence, it is often seen as much more intimate. Bourgeoys would have known practically everyone in the colony. However, she also faced difficult struggles during her first years there. There were no children to teach due to the high levels of infant mortality, which frustrated her plan to provide education. Despite this, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> upon herself to help the community in any way she could, often working alongside the settlers.|$|E
25|$|Natalie's parents {{separated}} {{early in}} her childhood and <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> badly. She lived with her mother Andrea (Cindy O'Callaghan) in Walford, {{but she had been}} closer to her father, Dave, and missed him terribly. Andrea favoured her other children, especially her older daughter Susie (Viva Duce), over Natalie. She was highly critical of Natalie and blamed her for the breakdown of her marriage (the unwanted pregnancy had ruined her figure and singing career, causing her husband to leave her). Andrea and Susie ridiculed Natalie for missing her father and wanting to keep in touch; Andrea claimed that Dave had no interest in Natalie.|$|E
25|$|In 1922 {{he joined}} the Novembergruppe, a group of leftist Berlin artists that {{included}} Hanns Eisler and Stefan Wolpe. In February 1924 the conductor Fritz Busch {{introduced him to the}} dramatist Georg Kaiser, with whom Weill would have a long-lasting creative partnership resulting in several one-act operas. At Kaiser's house in Grünheide, Weill first met singer/actress Lotte Lenya in the summer of 1924. The couple were married twice: in 1926 and again in 1937 (following their divorce in 1933). She took great care to support Weill's work, and after his death <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> upon herself to increase awareness of his music, forming the Kurt Weill Foundation. From November 1924 to May 1929, Weill wrote hundreds of reviews for the influential and comprehensive radio program guide Der deutsche Rundfunk. Hans Siebert von Heister had already worked with Weill in the November Group, and offered Weill the job shortly after becoming editor-in-chief.|$|E

500|$|Dylan {{composed}} {{this song}} {{in the form of}} a 12-bar blues. In the sleeve notes of Freewheelin, Dylan explained to Nat Hentoff: [...] "What made the real blues singers so great is that they were able to state all the problems they had; but at the same time, they were standing outside of them and could look at them. And in that way, they had them beat." [...] Into this song, Dylan injected one explicit mention of an absence that was troubling him: the sojourn of Suze Rotolo in Perugia: [...] "My baby took my heart from me/ She packed it all up in a suitcase/ Lord, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> away to Italy, Italy." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{frequency}} of the ritual reached its climax {{during the reign of}} Charles II (r. 1660–1685), the only English monarch who applied royal touch more than French kings. Over 92,000 scrofulous people were touched by him – over 4,500 annually. James II (r. 1685–1688) was very skeptical about the ritual but nevertheless indulged in it. He was deposed by William III (r. 1689–1702) and Mary II (r. 1689–1694), who refused to take part in what they considered a superstition. When a subject asked him for a touch, William reputedly said: [...] "God grant you better health and better sense." [...] Anne (r. 1702–1714) reintroduced the practice almost as soon as she ascended, touching 30 people on 6 October and 20 on 19 December 1702. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> very seriously, even fasting the day before. On 30 March 1712, she performed the ritual for the last time; Samuel Johnson (1709–1784) was the last of the 300 scrofulous people Anne touched that day. George I (r. 1714–1727) permanently discontinued the practice, but the exiled James II's Jacobite heirs claimed the ability until the 1780s.|$|E

500|$|In another instance, a scene {{called for}} Garland {{to exit the}} saloon, jump on a horse, and ride out of town. When the scene was shot, Garland jumped over the horse instead of on it, so the scene had to be shot again. During the second take, she twisted her ankle running down the stairs in the saloon, but {{continued}} the scene. When Garland returned home, {{she thought it would}} feel good to put her ankle in a warm bath and did. She left it there for about an hour, but when <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> out, she found that it had swollen to twice its normal size. When she returned to the set, Corman said, [...] "Well, we have to start shooting." [...] In order to fit her ankle into her boot, the crew cut the back of it and taped it to her foot.

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1824, Mary Shelley moved to Kentish Town in north London to be near Jane Williams. She may have been, {{in the words of}} her biographer Muriel Spark, [...] "a little in love" [...] with Jane. Jane later disillusioned her by gossiping that Percy had {{preferred}} her to Mary, owing to Mary's inadequacy as a wife. At around this time, Mary Shelley was working on her novel, The Last Man (1826); and she assisted a series of friends who were writing memoirs of Byron and Percy Shelley—the beginnings of her attempts to immortalise her husband. She also met the American actor John Howard Payne and the American writer Washington Irving, who intrigued her. Payne {{fell in love with her}} and in 1826 asked her to marry him. She refused, saying that after being married to one genius, she could only marry another. Payne accepted the rejection and tried without success to talk his friend Irving into proposing himself. Mary Shelley was aware of Payne's plan, but how seriously <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> is unclear.|$|E
500|$|Clyde Phillips {{claimed the}} Dexter staff {{did not know}} how the finale would {{conclude}} until late in the season, but he said Rita's death began to feel inevitable as the story evolved. Benz said she had been told that Lithgow knew about it {{from the beginning of the}} season. Phillips said the staff felt obligated to do more than kill the Trinity Killer in the final episode, especially because he felt the death of the third season antagonist (played by Jimmy Smits) was not handled [...] "as well as we could have". The writers discussed the idea of having Debra find out about Dexter's secret life, but decided they could not anticipate how drastically the series would be changed by that. Benz heard rumors from David Zayas that her character would be killed in the episode, but she was not notified until much later. [...] The producers met with her the day before the season finale script was distributed to the cast. She said, [...] "It was a tough meeting. In a bizarre way, it felt like a scene from Defending Your Life." [...] Benz described the death scene as [...] "very poetic". Clyde Philips said, [...] "She wasn’t happy. She loved being with us. We loved having her with us. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>it...</b> professionally. She was greatly disappointed. She’s a professional. She works in television.

500|$|... "Circus" [...] was {{performed}} on December 2, 2008 at American morning talk show Good Morning America, along with [...] "Womanizer". She wore a midriff-baring shirt, leather pants, a ringmaster jacket and a top hat. [...] "Circus" [...] was a major part on The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009), as the opening number of the show. The costumes of the performance were selected to show a metamorphosis. The show began with a video introduction featuring Perez Hilton as Queen Elizabeth I, welcoming the audience to the circus. In {{the middle of the}} video, the cylinder screen surrounding the stage started to rise, while Spears appeared on the video and shot Hilton with a crossbow, causing him to fall backwards onto the floor. As the video ended, Spears started to descend from the ceiling on a suspended platform, wearing a cheetah headdress, a ringmaster jacket, black shorts, high-heeled boots and carrying a whip. The headdress represented an animal. When she reached the stage, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> off to represent both a ringmaster and a lion tamer and [...] "Circus" [...] started. It featured acrobats taking the stage and spinning on giant rings in the air. The performance ended with Spears taking off her ringleader jacket to reveal a Swarovski-crystal corset, representing a slave. She then ran {{into the center of the}} main stage, surrounded by jets of smoke, to enter a golden cage and perform [...] "Piece of Me". People writer Chuck Arnold wrote that Spears, [...] "descending from above in a red ringmaster-meets-dominatrix outfit" [...] to sing the song, [...] "showed that her body was tight, even if her dancing always wasn't." [...] James Montgomery of MTV considered both [...] "Circus" [...] and [...] "Radar" [...] performances [...] "great". Spears included the song on her current residency show in Las Vegas, [...] For the performance, Spears appears from the back of the stage, in the center of a fiery ring, resembling a circus showgirl.|$|E
