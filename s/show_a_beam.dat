40|$|Simulation of high {{intensity}} accelerators {{leads to the}} so-lution of the Poisson Equation, to calculate space charge forces {{in the presence of}} acceleration chamber walls. We reduced the problem to “two-and-a-half ” dimensions for long particle bunches, characteristic of large circular accel-erators, and applied the results to the tracking code Orbit. 1 THE SPACE CHARGE PROBLEM In PIC tracking of an accelerator, a “herd ” of randomly generated macro particles are pushed through a lattice rep-resented by a sequence of maps[3]. Once all the macros have reached certain locations, SC (space charge) nodes, their density ρ is calculated by binning to a grid, and the potential Φ is found by solving the Poisson Equation with boundary (wall) conditions ∇ 2 Φ = − 10 ρ, ρwall(x, y, z) = g(x, y, z) (1) From the potential Φ, SC force components (with a coef-ficient to account for the balance between electrostatic and magnetic action), are calculated by derivation and applied to each macro as transverse angle kicks ∆p = F dt (2) In a ring with long bunches we may uncouple the transverse motion from the longitudinal ρ(x, y, z) = ρz(z) ρu(x, y) (3) and solve the Poisson problem in parallel in many longitu-dinal beam slices, where macros are subject to different SC kicks, due to different transverse beam aspect ratios. Since lattice map sequence controls the propagation, and the Poisson problem must be solved with all the macros evaluated at the same time, when the herd reach a SC node, each macro is longitudinally moved with respect to some reference (synchronous particle), using lattice trans-fer maps. Fig. 1 <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> bunch thus “frozen ” at a given time in a simple FODO channel for SC calculation. Limitations of this procedure are that maps used to put macros in their appropriate place are for the bare lattice (no extra focusing and tune shift due to SC forces), and that longitudinal forces between slices are disregarded. A better approximation is obtained by decomposing also the potential Φ in a longitudinal and a transverse part Φ(x, y, z) = Φz(z) Φu(x, y) (4...|$|E
40|$|Micromachining {{has enabled}} the {{downscaling}} of large, massive and power hungry systems into small batch-produced integrated devices. Recent progress in electrospray thruster technology, {{in particular the}} discovery of an ionic emission mode using the ionic liquid EMI-BF 4 as fuel has sparked interest in miniaturizing this thruster technology, initially developed in the 1950 's and lying dormant for several decades. Electrospray thrusters operate by applying a potential difference between a conductive liquid, usually {{on the tip of}} a needle or capillary, and an extractor electrode. Once a threshold voltage is reached the electric stress at the apex of the liquid surface overcomes surface tension and a spray of particles is ejected toward a counter electrode. The purely electrostatic nature of this type of thruster makes it an ideal candidate for miniaturization and the use of ionic liquids, also known as molten salts, as fuel allows operating the thruster in bipolar mode eliminating the need for an additional neutralizer. This thesis describes a process flow to fabricate planar arrays of silicon capillaries with integrated individual extractor electrodes. The developed process flow offers the possibility to manufacture arrays on the wafer scale allowing, in principle, to increase thrust from a fraction of micronewton for a single capillary to the millinewton level for large arrays. This process flow has been validated by microfabricating several thruster prototypes, which were packaged using Low Temperature Co-Fired Ceramic (LTCC) technology. In conjunction with this microfabrication process an onset voltage model was developed intended as design tool during thruster layout. This model allows to predict the voltage at which particle emissions initiate for complex geometries and to estimate the effect of dimensional variations on parameters such as crosstalk in large arrays. Tests carried out with thruster prototypes using single capillaries show a well defined energy distribution of the particles and the possibility to modulate spray current by changing the voltage. Controlled variations in the fluidic impedance of the emitters allow to spray in either ionic or droplet mode. Time-of-flight measurements with arrays <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> composed of ions (monomers, dimers), thus yielding a high specific impulse.

40|$|Atom {{lithography}} [1] {{has attracted}} {{a great interest in}} the scientific community as a technique for the fabrication of nanometer-scale ordered structures with a relatively simple apparatus. The atom lithography approach is similar to conventional optical litography, the light beam and the mechanical mask being replaced by an atomic beam and an immaterial light mask, respectively. Nanostructures are produced by space segregation of the atomic beam, due to its interaction with a quasi-resonant standing wave, that allows to realize ordered structures with interferometric precision and a space resolution well below 100 nm through either direct deposition or resist-assisted processes. The ultimate limits of the technique {{and the role of the}} interactions between the deposited atoms and the substrate are under recent debate. In order to better understand the relevant growth processes and the limits of atom lithography in terms of space definition, we have built an apparatus where a continuous beam produced out of a pyramidal-MOT funnel is used. The funnel is followed by a collimation stage, based on 2 D optical molasses along the transverse directions. The main advantage of this choice is the lower translational velocity of the atoms composing the beam with respect to conventional effusive sources (10 m/s vs hundreds of m/s typical for thermal beams). This leads to a larger interaction time during the collimating and immaterial mask (focusing) stages, which is expected to give rise to sharper deposited structures thanks to a significant reduction of aberration effects and of the amount of uncollimated/unfocused atoms arriving onto the substrate. 	The experimental set-up exploits a pyramidal funnel, made of two prisms and two mirrors arranged in the shape of an inverted pyramid with a small hole (1 mm x 2 mm) at its apex, mounted on a stainless-steel holder inside an ultra high vacuum system. The light for manipulating cesium atoms is produced by diode lasers operating around 850 nm, mounted in the external cavity configuration. The quadrupolar magnetic field for the pyramidal-MOT operation is produced by two coils in anti-Helmholtz configuration. We have characterized the atomic beam leaving the funnel [2], i. e., we have measured its density, divergence, longitudinal velocity and temperature. Induced fluorescence images, acquired using a CCD camera, and absorption measurements <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> divergence of 25 mrad, a longitudinal velocity in the range 10 - 15 m/s (depending on the trapping parameters) and a flux up to 4 x 109 atoms/s. The atomic beam diameter (FWHM) is 1 cm measured 30 cm downward the funnel apex. The collimation stage is based on 2 D optical molasses. The collimating laser beam is elliptical in shape (13 mm x 6 mm), with the longer axis along the longitudinal direction, which leads to an interaction time of 1 ms. We have explored both the "lin perp lin" and the σ+σ - polarization configuration. With the "lin perp lin" configuration we found a minimum divergence of 8 mrad at a collimating laser detuning of - 9 Γ (Γ being the cesium natural linewith, 5. 13 MHz), limited by the presence in the collimation region of stray magnetic fields produced by the MOT coils. We were able to reach less than 2 mrad (corresponding to the measurement uncertainty) in beam divergence with the σ+σ - polarization configuration. The collimation stage allows us also to reduce the beam diameter to 4 mm at 30 cm from the funnel apex, with an increase of the atomic beam intensity relevant for our applicative purposes. The next step of the experiment will be deposition of cesium through a light mask (a one-dimensional laser standing wave) on several kinds of substrates. Currently we are working on the deposition of nanostructured cesium beam on Self Assembled Monolayer (a nonanethiol layer grown on a gold substrate). Our preliminary results demonstrate that the SAM is efficiently impressed by the arrival of the laser-cooled cesium atoms. By the time of the Conference we expect to obtain nanostructures (arrays of parallel planes, spaced by half the laser wavelength) through resist-assisted atom lithography. The work is supported by EC through RTD-IST "NANOCOLD", and by CNR through Progetto Applicativo "Nanotecnologie". [1]	J. J.

50|$|A {{bending moment}} is the {{reaction}} induced in a structural element when an external force or moment {{is applied to}} the element causing the element to bend. The most common or simplest structural element subjected to bending moments is the <b>beam.</b> The example <b>shows</b> <b>a</b> <b>beam</b> which is simply supported at both ends.

The simplest type of beam is the cantilever, which is fixed at one end and is free at the other end (neither simple or fixed). In reality, beam supports are usually neither absolutely fixed nor absolutely rotating freely.|$|R
