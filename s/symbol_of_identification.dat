It presents an overview account of the South African flag legacy from the early colonial period through to the first national flag of the Union of South Africa in 1928. Its main concern however is the process which culminated in the raising of a new national flag on 27 April 1994. It shows how the flag issue was integral to the negotiations aimed at addressing South Africa’s political future and it is within this context that it sets out the steps taken to address the matter. It also recounts how the process initially floundered before the current design - which has become one of the primary graphic <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> for the new South Africa and its people - finally came into being. Despite the initial reaction to the design, it unpacks the extent to which the flag has been embraced by the South African population at large which has far exceeded expectation. Apart from its visual success, the flag is symbolic of the convergence and unification which is inextricably linked to the freedom and democracy which the new political dispensation encapsulated.

For example, in 1934, when Chaim Weizmann told the Zionist Action Committee that Hitler's rise to power was an [...] "unvorhergesehene Katastrophe, etwa ein neuer Weltkrieg" [...] ("an unforeseen catastrophe, comparable to another world war"), the Hebrew press translated Katastrophe as Shoah. In the spring of 1942, the Jerusalem historian BenZion Dinur (Dinaburg) used Shoah in a book published by the United Aid Committee for the Jews in Poland to describe the extermination of Europe's Jews, calling it a [...] "catastrophe" [...] that symbolized the unique situation of the Jewish people. The word Shoah was chosen in Israel to describe the Holocaust, the term institutionalized by the Knesset on April 12, 1951, when it established Yom Ha-Shoah Ve Mered Ha-Getaot, the national day of remembrance. In the 1950s, Yad Vashem, the Israel [...] "Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority" [...] was routinely translating this into English as [...] "the Disaster". At that time, holocaust was often used to mean the conflagration of much of humanity in a nuclear war. Since then, Yad Vashem has changed its practice; the word [...] "Holocaust", usually now capitalized, has come to refer principally to the genocide of the European Jews. The Israeli historian Saul Friedländer wrote in 1987 of [...] "the growing centrality of the Shoah for Jewish communities in the Diaspora" [...] and that [...] "The Shoah is almost becoming a <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification,</b> for better or for worse, whether because of the weakening of the bond of religion or because of the lesser salience of Zionism and Israel as an identification element".

40|$|This {{article is}} {{a case study of}} state society capital {{conflicts}} over the preservation of the Central Police Station (CPS) compound in Hong Kong during 2003 - 08. The conflict was between two fundamentally different approaches to urban space: a cultural economy approach that took culture and space as a source of economic profit, and an opposition discourse of preservation that emphasized cultural, historical and humanistic values as an end. The struggle {{turned out to be a}} moderate success for anti-commercialism. Drawing on and extending the notions of collective memory and spatial politics, this article examines how the various civil society actors, in their struggle against commercialism, sought to define and enhance the cultural value of the site through a variety of discourses and practices relating to history and space. It addresses the specific question of why and how certain constructions of collective memory succeed (or fail) to work with certain places in particular instances. The study shows that memories of the CPS compound contained both state-associated and people-associated accounts, between which the former prevailed. The state-associated account was embedded in a familiar, hegemonic story about Hong Kong, which, via an abstract process of symbolization around the notion of the rule of law, successfully turned the compound into an iconic <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> for the city. Beyond this, the civil society actors sought also to generate a sense of lived space associated with the people, and the outcome was mixed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to assess the {{environmental}} impact due to the restoration activity carried out on a historical monument, a medieval fortress located in a village in the province of Zaragoza (Spain). The fortress represents the symbol of the village itself, and {{an important part of the}} cultural heritage of the population. The restoration project has led to the creation of a museum of medieval history within two historical buildings: a Romanesque tower and a Gothic palace. The buildings have been restored to be accessible to visitors, and an LCA analysis was conducted on these interventions, taking into account the construction phase, the use of the buildings and the end of life of some elements after a reference time. The results showed how the use of some materials generates a significant impact throughout the life cycle of the intervention, and also how these impact decreases taking into account durability. The fortress is a strong mark on the urban landscape, and a <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> for the population. The restoration project aimed to recover the historical value of the fortress for the local community, to apply a sustainable economic management and promote a valorization of the area. That’s why the study has explored also the concept of social sustainability: while the intervention generates environmental impacts (as any building intervention), on the other side the recovery of cultural heritage generates social and economical advantages to be taken into account. The analysis aims to be a case study to investigate possible application of S-LCA guidelines to assess intervention of cultural heritage restoration. Based on the guidelines, a framework has been designed to fit the case study, which allowed to highlight the social and economical benefits that the intervention generates, especially on the local community...|$|E

The Roots of Otherness: Russia’s Turn of Century. Vol. 1. In this part, the author considers the characterization of Russia as a “developing society” {{at the turn of}} the XX century, which cannot be understood outside the context of capitalism both internationally and intra-nationally. At the same time the unique/specific features that most profoundly characterized the Russian social scene {{at the turn of the}} century and made its mark as its past within its present were represented particularly by the state, ethnos and peasantry. The power of the Russian state apparatus, its share of resources, its control over the population and its legal claims exceeded those elsewhere where capitalism was on the march. Massive processes of consolidation and ‘extended reproduction’ of cultural patterns, language usage, fundamental <b>symbols</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> and self-identification, as well as of related political loyalties, wielded together massive populations of different origins. Finally, during two centuries only, the Russian peasants moved all the way from the payment of tribute to unheard-of levels of exploitation and cattle-like enslavement of more than nine-tenths of the Russians; however, within another century came the emancipation from serfdom which made peasantry not only ‘free’ but landowning. The Russian dependent development of that time found its expression not only at the general level of the economic flows malfunctions and transformations but also at the distinct dimension of class generation and conflict. Parallel to the general crisis of the Russian political economy and the growing and increasingly explicit conflict between major social groups was an ideological/moral crisis expressed in perceptions, concepts and values (thus, the Russian intelligentsia confronted directly the state apparatus). The author concludes with the types of dissent initiated by men of knowledge, of ideas and of moral values, which was represented in different populist theorists including revolutionary populism and subjective sociology...|$|R

This doctoral thesis is based on research of the historical city center - squared. First part is focuses on the historical development of urban texture of the inner city of Brno and its squares. We are talking about Square of Freedom, Vegetable Market, Dominican square, Jacobs square, Capuchins square and Šilingrovo square. Based on individual characteristics, describing the emergence of morphological and functional changes in Brno square was created urban classification of basic types of square. City of Brno, as the capital city of region has a significant position in the structure of settlements. This fact has become one of the key aspects for the selection of examples of European cities and their squares. The second part of the thesis is based on comparative studies of different types of historical squares. In order to define the value of public spaces, it is necessary to look at the public places of historical perspective and deal with the causes that led to the decline of the importance and role of public spaces. Austrian capital cities of region (Graz, Linz, Klagenfurt and Salzburg) will be examined with regard to similar climatic conditions and a common cultural and historical context of the city. Based on urban patterns and graphic diagrams of each square are observed inner relationships between shapes of square, form, function and location of the position of an artwork. Research areas are also focused on comparing aspects of transport, green space, functional use, visual unit and social activities. The public space is shaped by a set of characteristics that promote diversity and interdependence of functions. For a better interpretation of the results have been established two benchmarks - <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> with the place and the Magnet (function and filling space).

40|$|Nicht angegebenIn my {{dissertation}} project I contemplate architecture under anthropological {{perspectives in}} a world of rapid cultural transformation. I focus on the increasing demand to design for different cultural environments and the considerations necessary to meet these re-quirements. In this context I will introduce new approaches and guidelines that anthro-pology and cultural studies can supply to the design process. Our world is changing ever faster and in the last decades the term "globalization" has entered almost every contemporary debate in a variety of fields. Although present in some form in earlier phases of history, globalization in current discussion has gained a considerably different meaning. Rapidly increasing worldwide interaction through phe-nomena such as the media, migration or tourism forces almost every discipline and profession to reconsider and to react. Dealing with an ever more interdependent world urges us to finally integrate developing countries into global considerations, stopping the long lasting construction of Western elites leaving important developing tasks out on the margins. This requires new thinking in broader terms – also in the discipline of architecture. Contemporary architects have to face a world without certainties to base their work on. They are left in a terrain that is unknown to them and the results of their designs are as unsound as their orientation in a culturally unknown landscape. Long established design guidelines such as locality, place, climate and available building materials have to be reconsidered and placed into a wider context. So far the only reaction has been a worldwide confusion and the escape into an explosive variety of -isms and stiles. I sug-gest {{that there is only one}} certainty left in architecture nowadays: Architecture is de-signed for the people who live in it, work in it, and are represented through it. But who are these people who suddenly do not act in a particular place anymore, whose cultural heritage loosens and whose horizons are influenced by images from the other side of the world? How does an architect deal with the demanding task to build for cultures s/he is not familiar with and new „transformed cultures“ that haven’t even existed before? Culture has never been static. It has always been a process of adaptation that hap-pened throughout the evolution of mankind. It only changes faster now, more dramatic and under more pressured circumstances that don’t leave time for “adaptation” but can only be referred to as “transformation”. Architecture is a major tool to express culture, identity and the ideology of people. Architecture is a physical statement of anthropology. And it is the field of anthropology that has put more effort into cultural studies and the overall understanding of the human being than any other discipline. Throughout its existence, anthropology has developed research methodologies that have found useful application in a variety of subjects. Also architecture is too important to leave it to archi-tects alone. Anthropological methodology can provide a most helpful tool to the archi-tect, particularly in tracing the major wants and needs of the people the design is based on - and anthropology can thus provide a central theme to hold on to, no matter what style and expression the architect chooses. Throughout a theoretical cross-cultural-study I point out in a holistic approach that fail-ures and successes of building projects are strongly interwoven with anthropological issues. Based on this insight I worked out a scheme for an "anthropological pre-design study" (APD-Study) which is destined to be implemented especially in regions where a cultural approach is hard to capture, and which should be implemented prior to the start of a major building project. Ladakh is one significant example representative for various regions, where recent de-velopments have revolutionized the existing political, economic, social and spiritual structure of society – and therefore also the process of building. I argue that in develop-ing regions planning strategies still put an overemphasis on the utilitarian dimension, namely, on economic and technological advances, whereas it is overdue to put fresh emphasis on the cultural, aesthetic and spiritual dimension to gain basic acceptance among the people. There will never be a customs control on the transfer of ideas and ideals. But more important than idealized superior visions is the strong need to trace the actual requirements and the needs of the people in the growing complexity of societies. Architects and planners need to go back to the people as the focal point of all activities. However, this is a dimension which is much harder to capture than technical certainties, and the simple ”add-culture-and-stir”-approach has caused more trouble than good. The truth is that there is clearly a lack of theoretical precision and methodological consideration in the search for human demands on housing. In the following chapters I will illustrate that the field of anthropology, which has long defined the human being and culture as the cornerstones of its subject, is the discipline that can provide the architect and planner with the necessary methodological toolkit to survive in the complexity of this task. Highlighting this point through the example of La-dakh, I will demonstrate that with the help of anthropology it is possible to develop a scientific way to trace the manifold wants and needs people may have regarding their housing situation. The ambitious task to approach both disciplines, anthropology and architecture, imposes constraints as well as obligations. First of all it has to find a vo-cabulary which is available to all, and above this the work should address academics and practitioners alike. A common conceptual framework of the two disciplines is clear-ly important in order to gain more satisfactory results regarding the building process in developing countries. A new phenomenon to deal with is the enormous speed of the current transformation process which creates unknown problems in all spheres of life, housing being one of them. While formerly the question was: “What is the attitude towards the built environ-ment in this or that culture?” It now has to be: “How is the attitude towards the built en-vironment changing in this culture due to increasing transnational interaction?” Although theoretically a mutual process, the unilateral character of this interaction – or intervention - in many less-informed countries is best expressed by the use of the term ”westernization”, which signifies the mechanical imitation of a particular way of life, as a synonym for ”modernization”. The creation of new needs is a fundamental requirement for reformation, social change, intellectual shift and alike and thus it is a phenomenon which – to state it in a simplified version - promotes both materialism and individualism. Along with this comes a transformation of attitudes towards the house. Because of the tension between cultural homogenization and cultural heterogenization, architecture also has gained a new meaning as a <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification.</b> However – there is a thin line between the mere copying of the Western approach and the potential for a creative transformation that could highly enrich the architectural landscape. How should a planner and builder react to all these new expectations in architecture? Trying to trace the real wants and needs is not an easy task, since one will soon find out that there is considerable discrepancy in what people think, what they say and what the real issues are. It is not enough to find out what people want, but to understand, why they want it. During a two-month field research in Ladakh, I conducted an ”anthro-pological pre-design study” (APD-study) prior to a major housing project called ”Solar Town”. The purpose of my study, which I conducted in one of the already existing housing colonies around the capital Leh, was to gain a profound grasp of the people’s views regarding their housing situation, actual as well as ideal, and - based on that - to suggest planning guidelines for the new project. There is no global truth in how to approach the difficult task of dealing with the human being in its cultural, social, spiritual and ideological context. However, it is important to strongly enforce the attention paid to this matter in order to gain more adequate and sustainable planning results for building projects – for this seems certain: The amount of time invested is insignificant in comparison with the severe mistakes that can be prevented. ...|$|E
40|$|Older Australians are {{increasingly}} looking for flexibility rather than stability in their housing options, writes Diana Olsberg AUSTRALIA’s population is ageing {{because of the}} combined effects of increased longevity and decreased fertility. These demographic changes are producing entirely unprecedented economic, social and political challenges for Australian society, for politicians and for governments and for Australian {{men and women and}} their families. Among the most dramatic changes that accompany the present demographic shifts are the far-reaching transformations in the meaning of home, family and place for older Australians in the new millennium, at a time when retirement lifestyles, residential intentions and reciprocal obligations are now subject to contestation and debate within the public discourses of government policy, the law, education and the media. In Australia today we are experiencing broad cultural shifts in family values, personal self-identities and material aspirations. And these changes are most manifest in the attitudes and intentions of older Australians with regard to their future housing intentions and their financial expectations for future lifestyles. On behalf of the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute, I have just completed a major national research project to examine these issues. The focus of my research has been an exploration of the experiences of mid-life and later-age Australian men and women regarding present housing tenure and future housing intentions. My hypothesis was that there may be pressure on housing tenure and attachment to the family home and upon intergenerational relationships as assets of older people, particularly housing assets, may be required by older people to finance their needs for accommodation, residential care, health and other services and for their enhanced expectations for retirement lifestyles. Data collection in the national project focused primarily upon home-owners aged over 50 years for the following reasons. First, they are already concerned with these issues, many of them facing decisions concerning their future residential plans, many of them having already retired from the full-time paid workforce and some having already made decisions to downsize from their long-term family residence either shifting location or into smaller accommodation. Second, the decisions made by these older Australians are indicative of changing priorities and expectations and relations among kinship systems which inform our understanding of social change within the context of Australia’s ageing population. For these behavioural and attitudinal shifts are very much a function of a transformation in personal identities of older Australians and the values which underpin them. The project allowed me to access the experiences, attitudes and intentions of a broad ranging sample of more than 7000 men and women aged over 50 years from all over Australia in a national quantitative and qualitative empirical research project. The majority were home-owners, most owning their home outright, although a quarter of the those aged between 50 and 59 still have a home mortgage. One third of the respondents were aged between 50 and 59, the first cohort of Australia’s Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1955. As reflected in the findings of this study, the patterns of housing tenure, lifestyle and family relationships of older Australians are changing. There is a significant shift in the priorities and values of older Australians. Overall, the most significant feature of the responses of older Australians was their desire {{to have a sense of}} flexibility with regard to their lifestyle intentions during the last years of their life. Whereas previously one could argue that stability was the defining factor in old age identity, the majority of respondents said that a sense of flexibility and fluidity was important, and that home ownership was the central factor underpinning the possibility of their now having a choice as to how to spend their remaining years., with an almost uniform definition of the home as a conduit to a person’s future lifestyle choices. The symbolic dimension of the home as the foundation for personal identity is now somewhat blurred as the values of consumption and lifestyle begin to take precedence. Home-owners spoke of their home offering them a diversity of choices for the future. Widespread commonsense perceptions that all older people are resistant to change and residential mobility are not borne out. One in three respondents had moved in the previous five years, with the largest proportion moving location. And one in three said they expect to move in the foreseeable future. Many commented the past or future shift represented a lifestyle decision, moving as some said to ‘a better place’ or to ‘warmer weather’ or to ‘access better recreational facilities’. Many respondents now living in country or coastal towns had moved to those areas (particularly to coastal areas) in the past five years - the well-known ‘sea change’ and ‘tree change’ phenomena. Whether the choice was to sell and spend, or sell and move to a location which provided access to better lifestyle opportunities, the prevailing attitude was the same; that after years of hard work they have earned the right to enjoy the fruits of their labours in any way they choose, regardless of the well-worn tradition of ageing in place with the sole aim of providing security for the next generation. More than one third of respondents lived alone, and increasingly as people age they live alone. Women in particular were living alone, and were twice as likely to be living alone than were men. Indeed, among those in this sample aged over 50 years, almost half the women were living alone, while three quarters of the men were living with a spouse or partner. Baby Boomers (respondents between 50 and 59 years of age) were lowest in every category of wishing to remain living in their present home, indicating that they are comfortable with moving for lifestyle reasons as opposed to wanting to stay for whatever reason. Indeed, for them the notion of ageing in place is likely to conjure up images of immobility and old age, something to which they express hostility. The most successful moves were by respondents who had formed ‘intentional communities’, either moving to a location or a retirement village where they already had friends. The importance of friends nearby was a frequent narrative. Ironically, this phenomenon can also be seen as a return to community but of a different sort. This is not the traditional family-based neighbourhood community; rather it is a set of emerging consumer classes, groups of people who find commonality in lifestyle and consumption patterns. Those new consumers pride themselves on their cultural literacy, as it were, as to the choices they make about where to live and what to buy. It is here that the foundations of traditional family obligations are being seriously tested, because the evidence suggests that in many cases people are prepared to use their greatest asset, the family home, to achieve those desires. The problems of house and garden maintenance, particularly on the death of a spouse or problems of declining health, loom as the reasons which would most precipitate a move for respondents in the future as they age. Many respondents caution that people should make their move to downsize, to move to a new location or into a retirement village while they are still active enough to establish new activities and new relationships. Women, people living in rural areas, and pensioners were more likely to state that they were unable to afford to move from their present home. WE CANNOT understand the nature of these new choices, these behavioural and attitudinal shifts unless we understand the transformations in personal identities of older Australians and the values which underpin them. Up until the mid to late twentieth century most people derived their identities from their lived experiences within well-defined types of communities into which they were born and continued to live. These identities could be described as ‘roots-based’, with their foundations in social class, voting allegiance, religion and church, neighbourhood, community organisations, local pubs and clubs. Increasingly, however, identity values are now derived from virtual sources - representations from an ever expanding media industry - print media, film, television (where the defining feature has been the continuing blurring of boundaries between fiction and non-fiction), radio, the Internet and other electronic communications. All of these expanding sources of representation are driven by the advertising and marketing industries which, of course, propagate and promote the consumption lifestyle. In particular, home ownership and housing tenure are at the centre of this nexus of consumption. The family home has long been important because it was the material manifestation of the long held Australian sense of egalitarianism - the home on the quarter acre block was the symbolic object which could be analysed, measured, spoken about by politicians, economists, community and cultural leaders and most of all by ordinary men and women. It was the egalitarian myth made manifest for all to see. The post-war rise of a home-owning middle class and the concomitant growth of the suburbs was not only important because it showed, from lived experience, our national myth to be true. The function of that home, with its backyard rendering it a safe, self-contained space, balancing nature and culture, was the reproduction of the family unit, the most important of all social institutions. The home during this period provided the necessary stability and security for reproduction, was backed by the promise of government support through the welfare state, and most importantly, was the living symbol which brought our national myth to fruition. From the late twentieth century, the influence of globalisation has brought about profound shifts in the way people born after the war formed their social identities. From the late sixties and early seventies in Australia, their attitudes and values were formed more through the social changes in Western societies (feminism, civil rights, environmentalism, the sexual revolution, consumer based individualism), which were given mass exposure through a rapidly expanding media, than by the types of lived community experiences of their parents. Many of the older generation have taken on the new values, priorities and experiences of their Baby Boomer children. This has transformed the self-identities and the types of cultural narratives through which both groups now find meaning and legitimacy in their lives. Within those frameworks, lifestyle emerges as the dominant cultural narrative, replacing production and reproduction. Witness the change in attitudes to beachfront real estate around the country. Previous generations did not value the beachfront because of property erosion. Now it is the site of the country’s biggest real estate boom, despite the foreknowledge of risk of future rising sea levels due to global warming. The shift here is from the material importance of assets to cultural assets like a view and access to lifestyle. The home itself has been replaced as the dominant symbol of personal identification and the foundation for family and kinship. Location is now the primary <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> because it provides access to those cultural sites where lifestyles can be enjoyed and displayed and cultural capital can be accumulated. And in the overwhelming acceptance of those cultural mores, property assets with lifestyle benefits have indeed become the essence of material success and aspiration. • Diana Olsberg is director of the UNSW Research Centre on Ageing & Retirement.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{cultural}} {{adaptation of the}} Slovak colonists to the new living conditions in Lowland {{did not result in}} the cultural destruction. There was a selective transfer of cultural information that corresponded with the Slovak enclaves’ current needs in the new environment. However, the Slovak material culture did not lose its previous role <b>of</b> the main <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> ethnic <b>identification.</b> Interaction between Slovaks, the majority community and other ethnic minorities, was reflected in the material culture. Social conditions in Lowland were favourable for the Slovak colonists’ efforts to negotiate the differences between their original material culture and the new one that they were building in the process of construction of their new living environment. The Slovak enclaves in Lowland manifested a high degree of “cultural literacy” — the ability to exist in certain material and social environment. Their cultural competencies that were acquired in the native cultural environment in Slovakia (socialization) were effectively implemented in the multiethnic and multicultural environment. The ability of ethnic community to adapt to the changed living conditions which does not have significant impact on ethnic identification is known as cultural adaptability...|$|R

Our approach {{is based on the}} notion of F-signatures, which are a special kind of histogram of forces [17, 19, 28]. Such histograms have low time complexity and describe signatures that are invariant to fundamental geometrical transformations such as scaling, translation, symmetry, and rotation. This article presents a new application of this notion in the field <b>of</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>identification</b> and recognition.

The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the representation of the self in schizophrenic patients through the tree drawing. Methods: Were identified 36 patients, 22 women and 14 (M-age= 53), suffering from schizophrenic disorder. Through the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) positive and negative symptoms, and the reactive tree representation of the self were assessed. Results: In the group with negative symptoms archetypal figures are more frequent, such as images that are part of the collective unconscious, or thought more archaic. In patients in which emerges the delirium, that is part of the most evolved thinking, near to the secondary process, the reality testing is better preserved. In cases where there are symptoms mixed the tree structure leads to an archetypal image. Conclusions: This study shows that in the draw of the tree trunk-to-crown ratio in schizophrenic patients was significantly higher than that of healthy individuals. The usefulness of the study insert itself in the Jungian analytic thought, for which psychotic thought corresponds to an abbaissement of the self activity.

5000|$|He gave as explanation: [...] "The name Gordon, which I inherited, {{reminds me}} very painfully that some Scotsman {{in some other}} age {{compelled}} a grandmother of mine to submit to his desires. In Bermuda I am black and treated as Bermuda treats the black people. So I {{want to be called}} by a name that belongs to my race and requires no prefix." [...] He was further quoted as saying that he had taken his new name from [...] "a famous West African chieftain, who had once been received by Queen Victoria". This was a reference to a 19th-century Trinidadian lawyer called Emmanuel Lazare, popularly known as Mazumbo (or Mzumbo) Lazare, about whom Maureen Warner-Lewis has written: [...] "although born in the Antilles, Lazare appropriated, or condoned the use of, an overtly African designation. The name was a <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> his <b>identification</b> with black people and the poor. He was a defender of their rights, joined the Pan-African Association founded in 1901 in England by fellow Trinidadian Henry Sylvester Williams, and became a moving spirit behind democratic political reforms {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century." [...] This characterisation of Mazumbo Lazare is additional evidence for Gordon's motivation in associating himself with the name.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the methodological implications {{of using a}} figurational approach {{to the study of}} Gaelic games (the Irish sports of hurling and Gaelic football) and their organisation and governance from the late nineteenth century onwards. Following Norbert Elias, we argue that data generation guided by theories, and potentially modifying such theories, are essential components of research endeavours. The problem of generalisation or representativeness of historical documents can be addressed by treating documents as part of a fi guration of evidence, thereby constituting a mutually supporting network of data that serves as a scaffold or structure for theoretical and empirical findings. Based on the experience of using documents such as newspaper and referee reports of matches, and also organisational documents such as the minutes of meetings at various levels of governance, we contribute to the discussion concerning borders and boundary maintenance between history, sociology and historical sociology. While we elaborate on the Eliasian perspective on emotional detachment, and secondary involvement, when conducting research, we also note the dificulties in avoiding ‘preferred’ readings of national history given that Gaelic games have been intertwined with the narrative and project of national self-determination in Ireland. Researchers are compelled to recognise the theoretical significance of sports as a motor and <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> emotional <b>identifications,</b> but must also create distance from their own national habitus in order to prioritise participation in intergenerational knowledge generation over further national myth-making. ...|$|R

Based on the evaluation of the financial reporting indicators that characterize the state of cash at the enterprise, it is justified to create reports to satisfy the interests of management personnel. The problems solved through the receipt of management reporting are considered. The stages and sub-stages of the organization of the management reporting system for operations with letters of credit have been determined, in particular, organizational (the development of goals and tasks of reporting, the development of a conceptual apparatus, <b>symbols,</b> the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> key users <b>of</b> information, the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> participants in the formation of management reporting), methodological (the development of regulations for the formation of accounting and analytical information management reporting, the establishment of terms, periodicity and reporting format, the development / completion of software), control-adaptive (control over the solution of tasks, the improvement of the existing system of management reporting in accordance with the impact of external and internal environment of the enterprise) ...|$|R

The Royal Navy exploited this sense <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> by naming an S class destroyer and one of their S Class submarines HMS Stonehenge. The Shell Oil Company commissioned the artist Edward McKnight Kauffer to paint a series of posters during the interwar period, to be used to encourage tourism by car owners.
