500|$|In a 2013 interview, {{the band}} {{revealed}} that they partied heavily during {{the production of}} Follow the Leader, with massive amounts of alcohol, drugs, {{and women in the}} studio. Davis explained further, saying that while recording the vocals for [...] "It's On", there were [...] "people getting blowjobs right behind me, there was girls banging each other in front of me, people getting boned in the closet right behind me, it was the craziest shit I've ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> and I sang that song." [...] According to Davis, he only agreed to begin tracking vocals when producer Toby Wright met his demands for an eight-ball (a one-eighth ounce of cocaine).|$|E
500|$|The second season, in 1945, {{featured}} two double-bills. The first {{consisted of}} Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2. Olivier played the warrior Hotspur {{in the first}} and the doddering Justice Shallow in the second. He received good notices, but by general consent the production belonged to Richardson as Falstaff. Agate wrote, [...] "He had everything the part wants – the exuberance, the mischief, the gusto.... Here is something better than virtuosity in character-acting – the spirit of the part shining through the actor." [...] As a teenager, the director Peter Hall saw the production; he said fifty years later, [...] "Of the performances I've <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> I'm gladdest I saw that." [...] In the second double bill it was Olivier who dominated, in the title roles of Oedipus Rex and The Critic. Richardson took the supporting role of Tiresias in the first, and the silent, cameo part of Lord Burleigh in the second. After the London season the company played both the double-bills and Uncle Vanya in a six-week season on Broadway.|$|E
500|$|To {{represent}} the ex-Borg colony on the planet, sets previously {{used for the}} episodes [...] "The Chute" [...] and [...] "" [...] from {{earlier in the season}} were used. This was further extended by the use of a computer generated matte painting created by freelancer Eric Chauvin. Borg sets from First Contact were not re-used, but instead a new set was built. This new set measured [...] in length curved around in a semi-circle, and McNeill was unsatisfied with this size. He said [...] "It was the smallest set that I've ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> We had no room on the stage to build a big Borg ship, because the other sets took up so much room." [...] He hoped that they had hidden this on camera, with it instead appearing as a series of separate corridors within the Borg vessel. McNeill explained that he had the actors walk the length of the set past the camera at the end, at which point a cut was made and they would go back {{to the start of the}} corridor to start filming again.|$|E
6000|$|And {{yet most}} men, she knew, {{would have thought}} to {{themselves}} at once, [...] "What a fool I was to come on beyond my proper station, and let myself in for this beastly scrape, just because I'd go a few miles further with a pretty girl I never saw <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> before, and will probably never <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> again, if I once get well out of this precious predicament." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'The impudent scoundrel!' I cried. 'I've {{never so}} much as <b>seen</b> him <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Why should I {{consider}} him in any way? I shall certainly not write if you would rather I didn't.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have {{no great}} curiosity to see it,' he remarked, with a laugh. 'It {{will be much}} as yesterday's. Zounds! though I have never risen to <b>see</b> one <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> I have looked on many a hundred ere I went to bed.' ...|$|R
2500|$|The Misunderstood is {{the only}} band that Peel ever {{personally}} managed—he first met the band in Riverside, California in 1966 and convinced them to move to London. He championed their music throughout his career; in 1968, he described their 1966 single [...] "I Can Take You to the Sun" [...] as [...] "the best popular record that's ever been recorded." [...] and shortly before his death, he stated, [...] "If I had to list the ten greatest performances I've <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> one would be The Misunderstood at Pandora's Box, Hollywood, 1966 ... My god, they were a great band!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Appearing as a {{prosecution}} witness {{at the trial}} {{of members of the}} unit in 2009, Jefto Jankovic, former investigative judge with the Basic Court in Banja Luka, told how on 23 August 1992, after receiving a call from the Public Safety Station in Banja Luka, he went to Korićanske Stijene to conduct a crime-scene inspection: [...] "We arrived there at about 3pm We saw that the area was rocky, the canyon was about 100 to 300 meters deep. I saw two piles of corpses {{at the bottom of the}} canyon. The corpses were lying there one on top of the other. It was a frightening scene. It was something I had never <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> As it was impossible to approach them, I asked our crime technician to record it using a video camcorder. This is all that we did during the course of the crime-scene inspection." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bankhead was {{director}} Irving Rapper's first {{choice for the}} role of Amanda in the film version of Tennessee William's The Glass Menagerie. Laurette Taylor, who originated the role of Amanda, was an idol of Bankhead's and also an alcoholic, whose brilliant performance in the original Broadway production reversed years of career decline. Rapper called Bankhead's screen test the greatest performance he had ever seen: [...] "I {{thought she was going to}} be difficult, but she was like a child, so sweet and lovely. I was absolutely floored by her performance. It's the greatest test I've ever made or <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I couldn't believe I was seeing such reality. Bankhead was absolutely natural, so moving, so touching without even trying. The crew was stunned, too." [...] But studio head Jack Warner rejected the idea because of his fear of Tallulah's drinking; though she promised not to drink during shooting, he refused to give her the part. The role was given to Gertrude Lawrence instead, whose acting was panned by most critics.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{wanted me}} to {{identify}} some one whom I had certainly never <b>seen</b> before <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and {{to tell you the}} truth, they were positively rude to me because I could not. Have you ever heard the name of Meysey Hill?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I can't {{have any}} quarrelling in this house. Why, George, I'd rather never <b>see</b> a paper <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> {{than to have}} a right-down fight here!" ...|$|R
60|$|I ran slap {{into the}} arms of a young {{policeman}} wot was passing. Nasty, short-tempered chap he was, but I don't think I was more glad to <b>see</b> anybody <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I hugged 'im till 'e nearly lost 'is breath, and then he sat me down on the kerb-stone and asked me wot I meant by it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You must bury me here, you know"--he {{caught at}} my arm. [...] "It's {{the first place}} of worship I've <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> How it makes a Sunday where it stands!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I did {{not give}} the city for love of a person I had never <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life....</b> Well, this was eight years ago. Girolamo took off the {{heaviest}} taxes, granted favours to the town and entered in solemn state with Caterina.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Go away,' she cried, 'and {{leave me}} to it. It is {{beautiful}}, beautiful,' she sang in strange, rhapsodic tones. 'It {{is the most}} beautiful thing I have ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Don't try to come between it and me. Take yourself away, you are out of place--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{complete}} stranger," [...] Mr. Ascough agreed. [...] "I {{had never}} <b>seen</b> him before <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I {{did a little}} trifling business for him in connection with his property." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} her sweet face, and knew it was true. And oh, I was so glad {{to have a new}} friend--an old friend, already! For somehow, as always, while the {{intellectual}} recollection had faded, the emotion survived. I felt as if I'd known Minnie Moore for years, though I never remembered to have <b>seen</b> her <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> till that minute.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was passing}} the 'ouse," [...] ses Bill Chambers, looking round at us, [...] "and I see an old man's {{face at the}} bedroom winder, and while I was {{wondering}} who 'e was a hand come and drawed 'im away. I see 'im as plain as ever I <b>see</b> anything <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and the hand, too. Big and dirty it was." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had hardly}} spoken before there {{rushed into the}} room {{one of the most}} lovely young women that I have ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering {{excitement}} and concern.|$|E
6000|$|... "All I can say," [...] Mr. Bundercombe declared, {{as he drew}} {{away from}} the note, {{which he had been}} examining, [...] "is that I do not wonder you were deceived, Mr. Giatron. This note is the most perfect {{imitation}} I have ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> A wicked piece of work, sir!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} that as I took my {{seat in the}} boat I {{was struck by the}} man's great size. He was not tall, but {{he was one of the}} broadest men that I have ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> But the gondoliers of Venice are a strong breed, and powerful men are common enough among them. The fellow took his place behind me and began to row.|$|E
60|$|I got in by {{the window}} easily enough, and found myself in a bedroom the like of which for {{disorder}} and dust and general awfulness I had never <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> all <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> But I did not pause to take in details. With William Adolphus under my arm I marched downstairs, fervently hoping I should meet {{no one on the}} way.|$|R
60|$|I trembled {{and looked}} over my shoulder; nothing there. I looked again in the glass, and {{distinctly}} saw the features and expression of a boy, who was shaving, not {{to get rid of}} a beard, but to get one. Extremely troubled <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind, I took a few turns in the room, and went back to the looking-glass, resolved to steady my hand and complete the operation in which I had been disturbed. Opening my eyes, which I had shut while recovering my firmness, I now met in the glass, looking straight at me, the eyes of a young man of four or five and twenty. Terrified by this new ghost, I closed my eyes, and made a strong effort to recover myself. Opening them again, I saw, shaving his cheek <b>in</b> the glass, <b>my</b> father, who has long been dead. Nay, I even saw my grandfather too, whom I never did <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} very hard, John Carter," [...] he said, [...] "of all the new ideas you gave me a few hours since. Little by little I have been piecing together {{the things that you}} said which sounded blasphemous to me then with the things that I have <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> past <b>life</b> and dared not even think about for fear of bringing down upon me the wrath of Issus.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought her," [...] he said, [...] "one of {{the most}} {{beautiful}} women I have ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> That is not saying very much, perhaps, but to me it meant a good deal. She was exceedingly gracious and her interest in you seemed quite real and even affectionate. I do not understand why you should wish to hide from such a woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely nothing," [...] Harcutt {{answered}} decidedly. [...] "I {{may as well}} {{repeat that}} my interest is in the man alone. I am not a sentimental person at all. His niece {{is perhaps the most}} beautiful woman I have ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> but it is with no thought of her that I have taken up this investigation. Having assured you of that, I {{want to know if you}} will help me?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had never}} been in the woods before, and {{everything}} was very new and exciting to me. There were squirrels and rabbits and birds, more than I had ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and little things that buzzed and flew and tickled my ears. I wanted to rush about and look at everything, but Peter called to me, and I came to heel. He knew where we were going, and I didn't, so I let him lead.|$|E
6000|$|... "What in {{the world}} brings you here, Harrison?" [...] he whispered. [...] "I am as {{glad to see you}} as ever I was to <b>see</b> a man <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> but I confess that I did not expect you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Because <b>my</b> {{friends are}} <b>in</b> {{the habit of}} telling me (and each other) that the sea is my only love. They were always {{chaffing}} me because they couldn’t <b>see</b> or guess <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> at any woman, open or secret. [...] .” ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was just}} feeling that I {{never wanted to}} <b>see</b> another dog <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> when a terrier ran out, shouting. As {{soon as he saw}} me, he came up inquiringly, walking very stiff-legged, as terriers do when they see a stranger.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{came off}} {{by and by}} hanging on Cap'n Tarbell's arm. The cap'n was dressed up in 'is Sunday clothes, {{with one of the}} cleanest collars on I 'ave ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and smoking a cigar that smelt like an escape of gas. He came back alone at ha'past eleven that night, and 'e told me that if it wasn't for the other one down Shoremouth way he should be the 'appiest man on earth.|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Peg," [...] was {{the quick}} reply, [...] "that cuts no ice with me. It {{was sure the}} rottenest {{exhibition}} I ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> But there's excuses, {{and you can just}} gamble I'm the old boy who knows. You kids were scared to death. What hurts me, Peg, is the throw-down we got from my old team and from the students. We're not to blame for rules made by fat-head directors. I was surprised at Dale. He was mean, and so were Hollis and Hickle--all of 'em. They didn't need to disgrace us like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|But I was not alone. On the one bench of {{the down}} {{platform}} sat the largest navvy I have ever <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> softened and made affable (for he smiled generously) with liquor. In his huge hands he nursed an empty tumbler marked [...] "L.S.W.R."--marked also, internally, with streaks of blue-grey sediment. Before him, {{a hand on}} his shoulder, stood the doctor, and as I came within ear-shot, this is what I heard him say: [...] "Just you hold on to your patience {{for a minute or two}} longer, and you'll be as right as ever you were in your life. I'll stay with you till you're better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} what, sir," [...] {{says one of}} them. [...] "You see, Tit my boy, I'm a connyshure, and up to snough; and if ever I <b>see</b> a lady <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> Mrs. Titmarsh is one. I can't be fimiliar with her--I've tried--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How I {{should like}} to see you sitting at a grand dinner-table, among lordly dishes and shining people, and father about the room unnoticed! Berta, I have never <b>seen</b> a dinner-party <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> and father said that I should some day; he promised me long ago.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{once for}} all, I'll {{tell you the}} facts. As I {{got out of the}} train a man I'd <b>seen</b> once before <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> made an attack upon me, and before the police came up, I got a blow in the face. Now you know all about it." ...|$|R
