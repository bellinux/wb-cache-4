5|$|The {{individual}} animals need {{to express}} survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking food, water, shelter, and a mate. The motivational {{system in the}} brain monitors {{the current state of}} satisfaction of these goals, and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise. The motivational system works largely by a reward–punishment mechanism. When a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences, the reward mechanism in the brain is activated, which induces <b>structural</b> <b>changes</b> inside the brain that cause the same behavior to be repeated later, whenever a similar situation arises. Conversely, when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences, the brain's punishment mechanism is activated, inducing <b>structural</b> <b>changes</b> that cause the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Longwang, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Maring, was the deadliest {{tropical}} cyclone to impact China during the 2005 Pacific typhoon season. Longwang was first identified as a tropical depression on September25 north of the Mariana Islands. Moving along a general westward track, the system quickly intensified and reached typhoon status on September27. After reaching Category4-equivalent intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, adverse atmospheric conditions along with internal <b>structural</b> <b>changes</b> resulted in temporary weakening. The structural change culminated in Longwang becoming an annular typhoon and prompted re-intensification. The storm attained peak strength with winds of 175km/h (110mph) and a pressure of 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg) on October1 as it approached Taiwan. Interaction with the mountainous terrain of the island and further <b>structural</b> <b>changes</b> caused some weakening before the typhoon made landfall near Hualien City early on October2. Crossing the island in six hours, Longwang emerged over the Taiwan Strait before moving onshore again later that day, this time in Fujian Province, China as a minimal typhoon. Once over mainland China, the storm quickly weakened and ultimately dissipated late on October3.|$|E

40|$|We propose an {{agent-based}} {{computational model}} defining the following dimensions of <b>structural</b> <b>change</b> - organisation of production, technology of production, and {{product on the}} supply side, and income distribution and consumption patterns on the demand side - at the microeconomic level.
