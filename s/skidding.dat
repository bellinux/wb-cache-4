5|$|While {{coming across}} the Piquet and Rossiter battle Lotterer moved in front of {{teammate}} Jarvis to claim second place. Rusinov entered the pit lane from the LMP2 lead for left-rear bodywork repairs and Rast was handed the No. 26 Oreca. Piquet was able to pass Rossiter for eighth position overall while Turner moved ahead of the other Ford car to run in third in LMGTE Pro. The second round of pit stops began one minute later when Jarvis entered the pit lane and {{the remainder of the}} LMP1 field followed in response for driver changes. Benoît Tréluyer pushed hard and lost control of his car's back-end at Vale corner, allowing Jani to move into second position. Christensen's right-front tyre was punctured at Becketts corner and he made a pit stop for a replacement wheel which promoted Turner to second in the class. After changing drivers in the No. 42 Strakka Racing Gibson, Danny Watts overtook González at Brooklands corner for second position in LMP2. Hartley went to the outside of Wainwright driving through Farm Curve and his car's right-front quarter made contact with Wainwright's left-rear section. Hartley went over the bonnet of the No. 86 Porsche but avoided flipping over; both cars went off the track, <b>skidding</b> across the gravel trap, and into the barriers {{at the end of the}} Complex. Both Hartley and Wainwright retired from the event and a full course yellow flag was necessitated to allow the cars to be extracted from the track.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSES: This study {{aimed to}} measure the <b>skid</b> {{resistance}} of the sidewalk {{in order to find}} out the relationship between different surface types and <b>skid</b> resistance. By using British Pendulum Tester, <b>skid</b> resistance of sidewalk was measured in a wet after snow-melt, sludgy, and snowy conditions. METHODS: The <b>skid</b> resistance was measured on surfaces including Concrete Interlocking Block Paving, Colour Asphalt Pavement, Granite Block Paving, Manhole, and Tactile Paving for Visually Impaired. Five trials at each measurement were made, and the average and standard deviation were derived. RESULTS: The <b>skid</b> resistance measured in wet after snow-melt, sludgy, and snowy conditions for the various surface types are summarized and compared. Reduction rates of <b>skid</b> resistance of sludgy and snowy against wet after snow-melt are also analysed. The <b>skid</b> resistance variation between measurement points which mimic pedestrian route in study site are analysed to check out the consistency of the <b>skid</b> resistance along the sidewalk.

25|$|ESC {{can work}} on any surface, from dry {{pavement}} to frozen lakes. It reacts to and corrects <b>skidding</b> much faster and more effectively than the typical human driver, often before the driver is even aware of any imminent loss of control. In fact, this led to some concern that ESC could allow drivers to become overconfident in their vehicle's handling and/or their own driving skills. For this reason, ESC systems typically inform the driver when they intervene, so that the driver knows that the vehicle's handling limits have been approached. Most activate a dashboard indicator light and/or alert tone; some intentionally allow the vehicle's corrected course to deviate very slightly from the driver-commanded direction, {{even if it is}} possible to more precisely match it.|$|E

25|$|ESC {{intervenes}} {{only when}} it detects a probable loss of steering control, i.e. when the vehicle is not going where the driver is steering. This may happen, for example, when <b>skidding</b> during emergency evasive swerves, understeer or oversteer during poorly judged turns on slippery roads, or hydroplaning. ESC may also intervene in an unwanted way during high-performance driving, because steering input {{may not always be}} directly indicative of the intended direction of travel (i.e. controlled drifting). ESC estimates the direction of the skid, and then applies the brakes to individual wheels asymmetrically in order to create torque about the vehicle's vertical axis, opposing the skid and bringing the vehicle back in line with the driver's commanded direction. Additionally, the system may reduce engine power or operate the transmission to slow the vehicle down.|$|E

This is a 'Participant Observation' study of the "skid row lifeworld" in Christchurch; an elucidation of the Dickensian world of night shelters and common lodging houses. Much of the Social Work literature, although concerned with the amelioration of the <b>skid</b> row phenomenon, has nevertheless made an important sociological contribution by emphasizing the fact that the men are not so much 'on' <b>skid</b> row as <b>skid</b> row is 'in' the men. Other researchers have emphasized the "naturalistic" perspective and thus have set a methodological precedent for studying <b>skid</b> row. <b>Skid</b> row is used in a generic sense to embody not only a particular area but also the psychological and sociological ties <b>skid</b> rowers have to agencies of social control and to drinking on <b>skid</b> row. <b>Skid</b> row is seen as being 'constituted' by its inhabitants.

25|$|The Prius Plug-in {{has three}} drive modes, all-electric (EV), and two hybrid modes: Eco and Power. The EV mode is user-selectable and when running in this mode the hybrid {{engine control unit}} (ECU) {{operates}} the vehicle using only the larger motor-generator (MG2) if pre-determined parameters are satisfied, such as sufficient {{battery state of charge}} (SOC) and vehicle speed within EV mode range. The Eco mode is designed to maximize fuel savings for any driving conditions, and modifies or smoothes out the electronic throttle control program to reduce throttle response, reducing the throttle opening to a maximum of 11.6%, and also modifies the operation of the air conditioning system. As an additional benefit, the Eco mode improves performance in low-traction conditions because the reduced output helps to minimize wheel <b>skidding</b> such as those caused by ice and snow. Power mode increases throttle response in the middle range more than normal.|$|E
25|$|Superelevation {{slopes of}} 4 to 10% are applied {{in order to}} aid motorists in safely {{traversing}} these sections, while maintaining vehicle speed throughout {{the length of the}} curve. An upper bound of 12% was chosen {{to meet the demands of}} construction and maintenance practices, as well as to limit the difficulty of driving a steeply cross-sloped curve at low speeds. In areas that receive significant snow and ice, most agencies use a maximum cross slope of 6 to 8%. While steeper cross slope makes it difficult to traverse the slope at low speed when the surface is icy, and when accelerating from zero with warm tyres on the ice, lower cross slope increases the risk of loss-of-control at high speeds, especially when the surface is icy. Since the consequence of high speed <b>skidding</b> is much worse than that of sliding inward at a low speed, sharp curves have the benefit of greater net safety when designers select up to 8% superelevation, instead of 4%. A lower slope of 4% is commonly used on urban roadways where speeds are lower, and where a steeper slope would raise the outside road edge above adjacent terrain.|$|E
25|$|Brake discs and pads require {{sometime}} {{to adhere}} to each other smoothly. The pads need to deposit an even transfer layer. For street and urban driving with new pads and rotors {{it is best to}} treat them as a break in period as you would a new car for 200 to 300 miles after this period the manufactures bedding procedure can be followed. This is typically some number of stops from a certain max speed to a minimum speed. For example 10 moderate stops from 60 mph to 10mph in a safe controlled environment where no hazards are present. The goal is to get the brake pads and brake discs hot. During this time it is ideal to keep the brake pressure and stops consistent without engaging the Anti lock braking system or <b>skidding</b> the tires. There will likely be smells and a light amount of smoke. This is normal. Once the brakes begin to suffer from fade(braking effectiveness slightly reduced) the process is complete. Continue to drive at moderate speeds to cool the brake discs and rotors avoiding the use of the brakes unless needed for emergency situations. Also take note when coming to a complete stop until everything has cooled not to hold your foot on the brakes which could create an imprint.|$|E
