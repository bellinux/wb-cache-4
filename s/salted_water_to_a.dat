50|$|The St. Lawrence Estuary is {{characterized}} by a saline front at the eastern tip of Île d'Orléans.

This zone of maximum turbidity is located between Île d'Orléans (salinity greater than 0 PSU) and Île aux Coudres (salinity below 10 PSU). The mechanisms of estuarine circulation associated with this environment make it a privileged site of primary and secondary production which shelters many fish nurseries.

50|$|An {{especially}} useful application of GIS concerns water quality in groundwater. For construction/situating of industrial plants, landfills, agricultural activities, and other potential groundwater contamination sources, {{it is useful}} to know how existing groundwater supplies could be affected or would be at risk of impact. Further, in the case of groundwater contamination and the need for subsequent containment and cleanup of the contaminant, an existing framework of the groundwater system would be valuable in planning remediation measures. This GIS could be the front end <b>to</b> <b>a</b> groundwater modeling simulation devised to fully capture the contaminant.An additional example concerning the use of GIS addresses a common problem associated with groundwater pumping and land subsidence or intrusion in coastal areas. Areas that have been overpumped of groundwater can subside, and when near the sea, this may invite flooding. Also, overpumping of groundwater in coastal regions may bring a different problem, such as the case in California where salt-water intrusion has compromised the aquifer. Generally, a <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> interface inland of the coast extends below the land surface dependent on the distance from the coast. Overpumping can bring the <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> interface <b>to</b> <b>a</b> higher position and contaminate an aquifer. A careful study and management of groundwater within GIS or with modeled GIS data can forestall or alleviate these problems.|$|R

40|$|In most of {{the cases}} caused by natural {{emergencies}} like earthquakes, flooding or tsunamis the public supply with electricity, drinking water and waste water breaks down. The public transportation system and the road-and path network will also collapse in a defined area. Especially in less developed countries, in which the public infrastructure is not build up that good anyway, this leads <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high health risk for the affected people because the access <b>to</b> safe drinking <b>water</b> is even more limited. This leads to the point that people drink water from unsafe origins like ponds and rivers. The German federal forces invented the so called common dosage plan <b>to</b> treat <b>water</b> from any contaminated <b>water</b> source (no <b>salt</b> <b>water)</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> safe, physical harmless drinking water. The system is based on different water treatment steps, namely flocculation, chlorination and activated carbon filtration. It is a large scale technical process and needs electrical power to run the pumps, stirrers, valves and controls. A group of scientist has adopted this large scale process and developed it <b>to</b> <b>a</b> currentless and simple to operate process, which can be used after natural catastrophes by the affected people. The author of this work was part of a drinking water helping team after the terrible Tsunami 2005. The team operated the drinking water supply for about 1000 refugees in a special tent camp. These experiences in the field work in Sri Lanka 2005 lead to the present work During the field work in Sri Lanka the so called sloping hose process was used. This process is based on the CDP and uses high amounts and concentrations of the treatment chemicals. Especially by the use of the chlorine tablets based on the waterfree disinfectant sodiumdichoroisocyanurate there were negative experiences during the field tests. In summary this was: - Rejection of the treated raw water by the affected people because of the high doses of water treatment the drinking water had a strong chemical smell and also a not common taste. This smell and taste was misinterpreted by the people because they thought the water could be toxic. - Production of high concentration of Trihalomethanes and other water soluble organic halogenated compounds due to the tablet additives of the used chlorine tables - The compounds sodium- and calciumhypochlorite belong to the dangerous goods due to the regulations of the international air transport association and therefore {{it is not possible to}} transport these compounds by air for a quick drinking water help action within the first three days after such a catastrophe. Therefore in this work, which was restricted to the investigation of stipulated German products due to the German emergency water legislation, namely the three compounds sodiumhypochlorite (NaOCl), calciumhypochlorite (Ca(OCl) 2) and sodiumdichloroicocyanurate (NaCl 2 (CNO) 3) as waterfree compound or as dihydrate were compared as the only in Germany permitted disinfectants by measuring their efficiency during the chlorination of so called “worst case water”. This water quality was defined by the highest German Technical Drinking Water Authority (DVGW) as the effluent of a municipal waste water plant with at least 300. 000 inhabitants and is the worst water quality, which could be used for the drinking water supply as raw water in emergencies.

40|$|Abstract: The Haringvliet estuary, {{just south}} of Rotterdam, used to connect the North Sea to the Rhine and Meuse rivers, until it was closed for water safety reasons by the Haringvliet dam in 1970. With the closure, the dynamic tidal {{ecosystem}} turned into a stagnant freshwater lake. Fish such as salmon and eel could no longer move between river and sea and largely disappeared from the rivers. In 2011 the Dutch government approved <b>a</b> plan <b>to</b> open partly the sluices in the Haringvliet dam <b>to</b> allow <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> enter <b>a</b> part of the estuary and open up a route for migratory fish to reach their spawning grounds upstream. When this happens in 2018, matters will improve for fish migration. However, much more effort is needed to restore the natural estuarine dynamics and bring back life, ecological and economical, to the delta. January 2015, WWF-Netherlands, Natuurmonumenten, Sportvisserij Nederland, ARK Natuurontwikkeling, Staatbosbeheer and Vogelbescherming Nederland were awarded a 13. 5 million Euro grant by the Dutch Post Code Lottery <b>to</b> realise <b>an</b> ambitious restoration of the tidal landscape of the Haringvliet. The programme will aim for restoring the tidal landscape of channels, shoals and sandbanks to host salmon and trout, as well as dolphins, porpoises and water birds. Special attention {{is given to the}} European sturgeon, which disappeared from the rivers as a result of pollution and overfishing. A rearing station and reintroduction programme will bring back this majestic fish. There will be special attention to reducing the threats of professional fisheries in the Haringvliet estuary and around the dam in specific. Options are to change to different fishing methodologies and to develop fish free zones around the dam. The Haringvliet delta is not only in need of an ecological boost, but also an economic one. Public access to restored nature is part of the wider plan. This approach will provide lots of opportunity for sustainable economic development in the region...|$|R

40|$|Groundwater-surface water (GW-SW) {{interaction}} in numerical groundwater flow models is generally simulated using a Cauchy boundary condition, which relates the flow between the surface {{water and the}} groundwater to {{the product of the}} head difference between the node and the surface water level, and a coefficient, {{often referred to as the}} “conductance. ” Previous studies have shown that in models with a low grid resolution, the resistance to GW-SW interaction below the surface water bed should often be accounted for in the parameterization of the conductance, in addition to the resistance across the surface water bed. Three conductance expressions that take this resistance into account were investigated: two that were presented by Mehl and Hill (2010) and the one that was presented by De Lange (1999). Their accuracy in low-resolution models regarding <b>salt</b> and <b>water</b> fluxes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dense drainage network in a confined aquifer system was determined.

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 A two phase {{investigation}} was undertaken in <b>an</b> attempt <b>to</b> {{determine the effects}} of variations in salinity on the distribution of benthic estuarine diatoms. The estuary studied was that of the Yaquina River which originates in the Coast Range of western Oregon and discharges into the Pacific Ocean at the town of Newport, Oregon. The first phase involved periodic collection of samples of benthic diatoms at ten stations along a transect at the water's edge at low tide extending from <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> fresh <b>water,</b> <b>a</b> distance of 20 miles. Permanent microscope slides were prepared and counts of 200 valves on each slide were made. The percentage of this total represented by each taxon was taken to be the relative abundance. The six most abundant species were selected and their relative abundances graphed. Synedra tabulata was found throughout the estuary but was most abundant at the lower three stations. Navicula tripunctata var. schizonemoides was found at the lower six stations, Melosira moniliformis was found at all stations and experienced a large increase in August, 1968. It is conjectured that the presence of this large crop of M. moniliformis might explain the decrease in relative abundance of several of the other taxa at this same time. Navicula gregaria was fairly well distributed above the lower two stations. N. comoides did not occur above the fourth station, but was found almost entirely in the lower estuary. N. viridula var. avenacea had a very limited distribution, being found in abundance only at the fifth, sixth and seventh stations. This first phase of the research also included measurement of environmental factors. Temperature of the sediment surface, salinity and light intensity data are presented. The second phase of the research involved isolation and culture of some strains of benthic diatoms, and performance of physiological experiments on these cultures. Six strains of one species of Amphora and one strain of another species of Amphora were obtained in culture and were examined under different combinations of salinity and light intensity in a Gilson Differential Respirometer. These particular strains of diatoms were relatively insensitive to variations in salinity but generally showed a decrease in photosynthetic production in fresh water. Zero light intensity caused a big decrease, as expected, and two strains showed a definite stimulation by the combination of highest salinity (30 parts per thousand) and highest light intensity (approximately 400 f. c.). The distribution of diatoms is related to variations in the environ:mental conditions of the estuary but a very complex interaction of all of these factors controls distribution...|$|R
