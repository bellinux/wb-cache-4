The study {{is divided into}} three parts: a summary of the sector’s economic and employment background; an analysis of the <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> <b>organisations</b> in all EU Member States, with emphasis on their membership, their role in collective bargaining, social dialogue and public policy, and their national and European affiliations; and finally an analysis of the relevant European organisations, particularly their membership composition and their capacity to negotiate. The aim of the EIRO series of representativeness studies is to identify the relevant national and supranational <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> <b>organisations</b> in the field of industrial relations in selected sectors. The impetus of these studies arises from the goal of the European Commission to recognise the representative <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> <b>organisations</b> to be consulted under the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The European Commission and <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> <b>organisations</b> at EU level {{encourage}} the lifelong development of qualifications and competence. This {{is reflected in}} many policy reports and reviews. This paper seeks to show the involvement of <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> <b>organisations</b> {{at the level of}} EU-funded competence development projects. Design/methodology/approach - A survey and four case studies were conducted. The population of 60 Leonardo da Vinci projects for a specific sector (agri-food-environment) which were implemented during the years 2000 - 2003 was selected for the study. For the survey project, documentation was analyzed based on two variables: type of project (to what extent did it require involvement of sectoral social partner organisations); and (the percentage of) involvement (of sectoral social partners {{who were involved in the}} partnership). A Spearman correlation test was used to evaluate the relationship between type of project and involvement. For the case studies project documentation was analyzed, and in-depth semi-structured interviews were held with project managers. Findings - The Spearman correlation between the type of project and involvement of sectoral <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> <b>organisations</b> was - 0. 031 (p= 0. 812). So there was no relationship. The case studies showed that the involvement of sectoral organisations clearly contributes to realising results in the projects. Practical implications - In the composition of partnerships for competence development projects at EU level, the Commission and project managers should be aware of the importance of including specific sectoral social partners organisations in the partnership. Originality/value - No study has been conducted yet that empirically tested the relationship between types of projects and the involvement of sectoral social partners in project partnerships. Important discrepancies are shown, of which stakeholders in sector competence development projects should be awar...|$|E

The scope of the study is limited to the practices of the social partners at cross-sectoral, sectoral and national level between 2000 and 2014.

40|$|The growing {{participation}} {{of women in}} the labour market has prompted changes in the way European <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> <b>organisations</b> tackle gender issues. Their organisational and collective bargaining structures – historically dominated by men – have had to adapt to include gender equality issues. This report examines the extent to which gender equality is incorporated by the social partners in their organisations and in their policymaking at European and national level. It explores the differences between the priority given to gender issues between the social partners in different countries and the possible factors behind such differences. Finally, it examines the main challenges faced by the social partners when attempting to promote gender equality within their organisations and in the wider labour market. The findings are based on the contributions of Eurofound’s network of European correspondents, covering all EU Member States and Norway...|$|E

While key aspects of the EU Semester, such as {{the involvement of}} the social partners in the coordination of fiscal policies or in the macroeconomic imbalance procedure, are outside the scope of the report, it should be acknowledged that the policies adopted in the context of these processes have had a significant influence on national industrial relations systems, labour market policies and institutions and the framework in which social partners are operating.

This said, the sector has been hard hit by the economic crisis. High levels of redundancies are the result. The standard labour contract is losing ground to self-employed persons and freelancers. Worsening labour conditions are been reported. The economic crisis has also had its impact on the social partner organisations; they have already had to economize on their training institutes...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] In 1998, the European Commission {{set out the}} {{framework}} for sectoral dialogue committees {{with the aim of}} promoting dialogue between sectoral social partners at European level. The committees were set up as the central fora for consultation, joint initiatives and negotiation for the given sectors. Union law does not make reference to the concept of representativeness. The Commission first used this concept in its 1993 Communication concerning the application of the Agreement on Social Policy. Representativeness became the key issue of dispute in a legal case in 1996 (UEAPME v. Council of the European Union, Case T- 135 / 96). UEAPME challenged the legality of the Parental Leave Directive and the dispute became the subject of litigation before the European Court of First Instance (CFI). The CFI asserted that agreements reached through the social dialogue – which are then incorporated into directives – may be challenged on grounds of their democratic legitimacy. CFI deemed this necessary, since the Directive was not subject to scrutiny by the European Parliament. Since this ruling, it has been the legal responsibility of the European Commission to scrutinise to identify the European social partners who are eligible to engage in European social dialogue. In 2006, the European Commission mandated Eurofound to carry out studies on the representativeness of European <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> <b>organisations,</b> with the aim of identifying the relevant national and supranational interest associations in the field of industrial relations in selected sectors. (Prior to 2006, the studies had been coordinated by the Catholic University of Louvain. ...|$|E
40|$|In October 2009 the Administrative Board of Public Employment Service Austria (AMS) {{set up an}} AMS Standing Committee on New Skills; {{this step}} - against the {{background}} of the difficult economic situation at that time - aimed at making use of periods when companies are characterised by weak capacity utilisation combined with labour market-policy support measures (such as educational leave, short-time work with qualification, AMS skills training measures) in order to prepare the labour force (i. e. employees in dependent employment and unemployed) on time for coming changes and challenges. But also independent of the respective economic situation there is urgent need to further develop the qualifications, knowledge and competences of the potential labour force with foresight to ensure that companies and the economic location of Austria overall remain competitive. In several workshops the AMS Standing Committee on New Skills aims to identify the companies' change processes by providing input from sectoral experts from major, innovative companies and institutions jointly with representatives of continuing education and training (CET) establishments and <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> <b>organisations.</b> These change processes allow conclusions to be drawn about current and future requirements for employees and job-seekers, which will in turn be integrated into the forwardlooking development of CET measures. It is the explicit objective of the AMS Standing Committee on New Skills to take timely qualification measures by anticipating these developments at an early stage and thus keep pace with the qualifications required in three to five years. In the period between November 2010 and June 2011, working groups were set up in the following four company clusters (in alphabetical order) : Electrical engineering, electronics, telecommunications; Energy and environmental engineering; Healthcare and nursing; Wholesale and retail trade.
