5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, {{it is crucial that}} the court should not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics, who {{adhere to}} the psychosocial {{hypothesis}} for unidentified flying objects, argue that the convergence of New World Order conspiracy theory and UFO conspiracy theory {{is a product of}} not only the era's widespread mistrust of governments and the popularity of the extraterrestrial hypothesis for UFOs but of the far right and ufologists actually joining forces. Barkun notes that the only positive <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> development is that, if conspirators plotting to rule the world are believed to be aliens, traditional human scapegoats (Freemasons, Illuminati, Jews, etc.) are downgraded or exonerated.|$|E

25|$|There {{is little}} arable land in Boho {{and this is}} usually set aside for {{domestic}} use. Due to low farming income, there are few people {{that can make a}} living as full-time farmers in the area, rather there is a mixture of people who derive some income from faming {{but for the most part}} their main incomes derive from other sources. The positive <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> low intensity agriculture system is that Boho still retains a high diversity of environmentally important species that are in decline on a national scale found in species rich hay meadows, pastures and semi-natural habitats.|$|E
25|$|The Asia Minor Expedition and Catastrophe, {{as well as}} the {{uprooting}} of {{the ethnic}} Greek population from Anatolia after three thousand years of presence, had an enormous impact on the Greek psyche. The Smyrna Catastrophe has been considered as the worst incident of modern Greek history, and as an incident of the same magnitude as the Fall of Constantinople for the Greeks. The matters related to the refugees halted the Greco-Turkish relations for many decades. The issues concerning the missing Greeks were soon raised in the International Red Cross, without any success and cooperation from the Turkish <b>side.</b> <b>To</b> <b>this</b> day, the Greek citizens who were born in Asia Minor have to apply for a visa in order to enter Turkey (something that does not apply to Greek citizens born in Greece).|$|E

500|$|St James' {{originally}} {{took the}} form of a simple rectangular block, without transepts or chancel, with a tower at the western end and a classical portico of the Doric order on either <b>side.</b> <b>To</b> <b>this</b> has been added Verge's vestry framed by two small porticos, and a similar portico as an entrance to the tower. [...] The church is built of local brick, its walls divided by brick pilasters into a series of bays. The walls are pierced by large windows with round arched heads in a colour that separates and defines them against the walls. The roof carries over the end walls with the gable forming triangular pediments of classical proportions carrying a cornice across the eaves line. Thus the architectural treatment on the side walls is continued around the end walls.|$|E
500|$|The {{waterline}} belt of the Lexington-class ships tapered [...] in thickness {{from top}} to bottom and was angled 11° outwards at the top to increase the armor's relative thickness to horizontal, close-range fire (a concept taken from HMS Hood). The down <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> practice was a reduction of the relative height of the belt, which increased the chance of plunging shellfire going over or under it. The belt covered the middle [...] of the ships. Forward, the belt ended in a bulkhead also tapered from seven to five inches in thickness. Aft, it terminated at a seven-inch bulkhead. This belt had a height of [...] The upper deck was [...] thick in two layers.

500|$|Atheneum Books for Young Readers reissued {{a revised}} version of the book in 2009. The story was {{shortened}} by cutting some descriptive passages and allowing the illustrations to convey the setting. Calpurnia's final poem was also eliminated. New illustrations in acrylics were created by Leo and Diane Dillon, {{who went on to}} win two Caldecott Awards. Unlike the more realistic illustrations by Weisgard, the Dillons emphasized the magical reality of the story, as in the cover picture, where Calpurnia's profile is almost hidden inside a stylized blue fish. Mary Harris Russell, writing for The Chicago Tribune, felt modern audiences would appreciate the way [...] "the fantasy <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> land of cypress trees and silent rivers is amplified and contrasted with the realistic background of little Calpurnia's life." [...] The Dillon's version of The Secret River received one of two honorable mentions in the fiction category of the 2012 BolognaRagazzi Awards, an international children's book award that honors the art and design of illustrated books worldwide. In the words of the Bologna jury, [...] "It is only fitting that Marjorie Rawlings, the great American writer loved by so many generations of readers, is finally paid such a refined and sensitive tribute." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other of Minulescu's contemporaries, {{among them}} Davidescu, {{argued that the}} popular appeal of his poetry (which they {{referred}} to as Minulescianism), was turning into mere fashion. Speaking of another <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> trend, Vianu evidenced that, from as early as his debut novel, Minulescu had become the source of [...] "an industry of Minulescian parody"; the writer Victor Eftimiu recalled that his first successful writing had been a piece which mocked Minulescu's poem Romanţa celor trei romanţe ("The Romance of the Three Romances"), and was titled Romanţa celor trei sarmale ("The Romance of the Three Sarmale").|$|E
2500|$|The down <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{performance}} is recoil. The amount of recoil the cartridge generates {{is a step}} up from the non-magnum [...]30 caliber (7.62mm) cartridges. Its recoil is about 30% {{greater than that of}} the [...]30-06 Springfield, which is known as a 'stout' cartridge. This would put the [...]300 Winchester Magnum at the upper limit of what most shooters can shoot comfortably for extended shooting sessions. As a rough comparison, the recoil of the [...]300 Winchester Magnum is roughly comparable to a 12 gauge shotgun shooting 1 oz. slugs. This greater recoil can make the [...]300 Winchester Magnum, despite its inherent accuracy advantages, a harder cartridge to shoot accurately, when compared to non-magnum [...]30 caliber cartridges such as the [...]30-06 Springfield or the [...]308 Winchester. On the other hand, recoil is subjective (some are more sensitive to it than others) and one can get used to it with practice. Also, many rifles available today now have effective recoil attenuating features built into them, such as muzzle compensators and energy absorbing stocks and butt-pads, that can significantly lessen recoil as it is felt by the shooter.|$|E
