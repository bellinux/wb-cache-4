40|$|<b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 are ubiquitously {{expressed}} mammalian transcription {{factors that}} activate or repress {{the expression of}} a variety of genes and are thought to compete for the same DNA binding site. We used indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and image deconvolution to show that <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 are organized into distinct nonoverlapping domains in human breast and ovarian cells. Domains of <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 infrequently associate with sites of transcription. Sp 3 partitions with the tightly bound nuclear protein fraction of hormone responsive MCF- 7 breast cancer cells, whereas only a subpopulation of Sp 1 is found in that fraction. Both <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 are bound to the nuclear matrix, and the nuclear matrix-associated sites of <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 are different. Indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 associate with histone deacetylases 1 and 2 and with the estrogen receptor �, albeit at low frequencies in MCF- 7 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and re-ChIP assays revealed that although both <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 bind to the estrogen-responsive trefoil factor 1 promoter in MCF- 7 cells, they do not occupy the same promoter.

The recent transgenic intervention and mutational genetics have made it possible to stably alter levels of naturally occurring polyamines and study their biological effects. We bring together an analysis of certain metabolic changes, particularly in amino acids, to infer the responsive regulation brought about by increased diamine or polyamine levels in actively growing poplar cell cultures (transformed with mouse ornithine decarboxylase gene to accumulate high Put levels) and ripening tomato pericarp (transformed with yeast S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase gene to accumulate high <b>Spd</b> <b>and</b> Spm levels at the cost of Put). Our analysis indicates that increased Put has little effect on increasing the levels of <b>Spd</b> <b>and</b> Spm, while <b>Spd</b> <b>and</b> Spm levels are inter-dependent. Further, Put levels were positively associated with Ala (alpha and beta), Ile and GABA and negatively correlated with Gln and Glu in both actively growing poplar cell cultures and non-dividing tomato pericarp tissue.

40|$|The most {{influential}} theory {{to explain the}} pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been the "Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis" (ACH) first formulated in 1992. The ACH proposes that the deposition of ß-amyloid (Aß) is the initial pathological event in AD leading {{to the formation of}} senile plaques (<b>SPs)</b> <b>and</b> then to neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) death of neurons, and ultimately dementia. This paper examines two questions regarding the ACH: (1) is there a relationship between the pathogenesis of <b>SPs</b> <b>and</b> NFTs, and (2) what is the relationship of these lesions to disease pathogenesis? These questions are examined in relation to studies of the morphology and molecular determinants of <b>SPs</b> <b>and</b> NFTs, the effects of gene mutation, degeneration induced by head injury, the effects of experimentally induced brain lesions, transgenic studies, and the degeneration of anatomical pathways. It was concluded that <b>SPs</b> <b>and</b> NFTs develop independently and may be the products rather than the causes of neurodegeneration in AD. A modification to the ACH is proposed which may better explain the pathogenesis of AD, especially of late-onset cases of the disease...|$|R

Several-fold increase in Put production was achieved by expressing a mouse ornithine decarboxylase cDNA either {{under the control of}} a constitutive (in poplar) or an inducible (in Arabidopsis) promoter. The transgenic poplar cells produced and accumulated 8 – 10 times higher amounts of Put than the non-transgenic cells, whereas the Arabidopsis seedlings accumulated up to 40 -fold higher amounts of Put; however, in neither case the cellular Spd or Spm increased consistently. The rate of <b>Spd</b> <b>and</b> Spm catabolism and the half-life of cellular <b>Spd</b> <b>and</b> Spm were measured by pulse-chase experiments using [14 C]Spd or [14 C]Spm. Spermidine half-life was calculated to be about 22 – 32 h in poplar and 52 – 56 h in Arabidopsis.

The rates of <b>Spd</b> <b>and</b> Spm catabolism in both species were several-fold slower than those of Put, and the overproduction of Put had only a small effect on the overall rates of turnover of Spd or Spm. There was little effect on the rates of Spd to Spm conversion as well as the conversion of Spm into lower polyamines.

5|$|The {{biology is}} poorly known; {{the male and}} female {{reproductive}} castes were described {{for the first time in}} 2012. The genus is known mainly from isolated workers found in Winkler or Berlese samples. Tatuidris workers have peculiar mandibular brushes and a powerful sting, which led Brown & Kempf to speculate that Tatuidris might be specialist predators of active or slippery arthropod prey. Until 2011, no observations of live specimens were registered. Details of a first collection event of a small live colony (3 workers and 4 gynes) by Thibaut Delsinne in a mid-elevation forest in southeastern Ecuador suggest that Tatuidris may well be a highly specialized predator, as colonies kept in captivity did not accept any food item offered to them. Food items rejected by the ants included live and dead termites, millipedes, mites, various insect parts, sugar water, tuna, biscuits, live and dead fruit flies (Drosophila), live springtails, live myriapods (Chilopoda and Diplopoda), live and dead Diplura, small live spiders, small live pseudoscorpions, one small snail, uncooked hen egg (i.e. piece of cotton wool soaked with fresh whisked hen egg), ant larvae (Gnamptogenys <b>sp.),</b> <b>and</b> live ant workers (Cyphomyrmex sp., Brachymyrmex sp.).

40|$|Abstract Background Topoisomerase IIα {{has been}} shown to be down-regulated in doxorubicin-resistant cell lines. The {{specificity}} proteins <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 have been implicated in regulation of topoisomerase IIα transcription, although the mechanism by which they regulate expression is not fully understood. Sp 1 {{has been shown}} to bind specifically to both proximal and distal GC elements of the human topoisomerase IIα promoter in vitro, while Sp 3 binds only to the distal GC element unless additional flanking sequences are included. While Sp 1 is thought to be an activator of human topoisomerase IIα, the functional significance of Sp 3 binding is not known. Therefore, we sought to determine the functional relationship between <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 binding to the topoisomerase IIα promoter in vivo. We investigated endogenous levels of Sp 1, <b>Sp</b> 3 <b>and</b> topoisomerase IIα as well as binding of both <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 to the GC boxes of the topoisomerase IIα promoter in breast cancer cell lines in vivo after short term doxorubicin exposure. Results Functional effects of <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 were studied using transient cotransfection assays using a topoisomerase IIα promoter reporter construct. The in vivo interactions of <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 with the GC elements of the topoisomerase IIα promoter were studied in doxorubicin-treated breast cancer cell lines using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Relative amounts of endogenous proteins were measured using immunoblotting. In vivo DNA looping mediated by proteins bound at the GC 1 and GC 2 elements was studied using the chromatin conformation capture assay. Both <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 bound to the GC 1 and GC 2 regions. <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 were transcriptional activators and repressors respectively, with Sp 3 repression being dominant over Sp 1 -mediated activation. The GC 1 and GC 2 elements are linked in vivo to form a loop, thus bringing distal regulatory elements and their cognate transcription factors into close proximity with the transcription start site. Conclusion These observations provide a mechanistic explanation for the modulation of topoisomerase IIα and concomitant down-regulation that can be mediated by topoisomerase II poisons. Competition between <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 for the same cognate DNA would result in activation or repression depending on absolute amounts of each transcription factor in cells treated with doxorubicin. </p...|$|R
