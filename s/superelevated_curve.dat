25|$|The Middletown {{station is}} in need of being {{relocated}} because it is currently on a <b>superelevated</b> <b>curve</b> and does not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as well. It is to be moved to a location at Ann Street and Pennsylvania Route 230, between the current station and Harrisburg International Airport. Initial plans called for the station to be moved next to the airport terminal, but this was rejected in favor of keeping the station in the downtown area. By 2013, it was expected to be completed by 2015 and estimated to cost $32million. Funding would be provided by the Federal Transit Administration and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT).|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the State of Indiana {{has built}} a number of intersections where {{one or both of}} the roads are located on curves. The AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets {{recommends}} that in such cases “the alignment should be as straight and the gradient as flat as practical. ” This wording, consistent with Part V of the Indiana Design Manual, allows for the design of intersections on curves if other solutions prove to be too expensive. Several of these intersections have raised safety concerns and led to expensive corrective measures. Due to these safety and economic issues, INDOT currently avoids designing intersections on segments with steep superelevation. The focus of this research is to determine what effect curvature and superelevation have on intersection safety. Based on the results, the goal is to provide design standards for curvature and superelevation for cases where the major road is located on a <b>superelevated</b> <b>curve...</b>|$|E
50|$|Typical values {{range from}} 2 percent for {{straight}} segments to 10 percent for sharp <b>superelevated</b> <b>curves.</b> It {{may also be}} expressed as {{a fraction of an}} inch in rise over a one-foot run (e.g. 1/4 inch per foot).|$|R
40|$|Multiplan {{spreadsheet}} solutions {{were developed}} {{for a set}} of hydraulic and highway engineering computations of common interest to county engineers. These include earthwork, vertical and horizontal <b>curves,</b> staking <b>superelevated</b> <b>curves</b> and sign inventories for highways. The hydraulic applications were ditch flow, runoff, culvert size and stage discharge...|$|R
500|$|Although many South Pasadena {{residents}} {{opposed the}} division of the city that the parkway would bring, the city's voters elected supporters in the 1936 elections. The state, which had the power to put the road where it wished even had South Pasadena continued to oppose it, approved the route on April 4, 1936. The route used the Arroyo Seco's west bank to near Hough Street, where it crossed to the east and cut through South Pasadena to the south end of Broadway (now Arroyo Parkway) in Pasadena. Another project, the Arroyo Seco Flood Control Channel, was built by the Works Progress Administration before and during construction of the parkway to avoid damages from future floods. A number of state engineers toured East Coast roads in early 1938, including Chicago's Lake Shore Drive, full and modified cloverleaf interchanges in Massachusetts and New Jersey, and Robert Moses's parkway system in New York City. The parkway was the first road built in California under a 1939 freeway law that allowed access to be completely limited to a number of specified points. Although, in some areas, it was possible to use a standard diamond interchange, other locations required folded diamonds, or, as the engineers called them, [...] "compressed cloverleafs", where local streets often took the place of dedicated ramps, ending at the parkway with a sharp right turn required to enter or exit. The highway was designed with two 11–12foot (3.4-3.7m) lanes and one ten-foot (3.0m) shoulder in each direction, with the wider inside (passing) lanes paved in black asphalt concrete and the outside lanes paved in gray Portland cement concrete. The differently-colored lanes would encourage drivers to stay in their lanes. (By mid-1939, the state had decided to replace the shoulders with additional travel lanes for increased capacity; except on a short piece in South Pasadena, these were also paved with Portland cement. So that disabled vehicles could be safely removed from the roadway, about 50 [...] "safety bays" [...] were constructed in 1949 and 1950.) The engineers used a design speed of , <b>superelevating</b> <b>curves</b> where necessary to accomplish this. (The road is now posted at [...]) Despite the freeway design, many parkway characteristics were incorporated, such as plantings of mostly native flora alongside the road.|$|R
