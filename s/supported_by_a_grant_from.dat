5|$|The Society has {{a variety}} of {{functions}} and activities. It supports modern science by disbursing nearly £42million to fund approximately 600 research fellowships for both early and late career scientists, along with innovation, mobility and research capacity grants. Its Awards, prize lectures and medals all come with prize money intended to finance research, and it provides subsidised communications and media skills courses for research scientists. Much of this activity is <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>from</b> the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, most of which is channelled to the University Research Fellowships (URF). In 2008, the Society opened the Royal Society Enterprise Fund, intended to invest in new scientific companies and be self-sustaining, funded (after an initial set of donations on the 350th anniversary of the Society) by the returns from its investments.|$|E
25|$|Self-understanding and self-alienation: Existential hermeneutics and {{psychopathology}} (2014-2016). The project explores what {{experiences of}} self-alienation {{tell us about}} human self-understanding, and conversely how a more nuanced approach to questions of self-understand might help reach {{a better understanding of}} experiences of self-alienation. The project is <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>from</b> the VELUX Foundation.|$|E

25|$|In 1958–1959 Ashkin won a Ford Foundation {{grant to}} spend a sabbatical year in Geneva, Switzerland, at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. There, he {{became a member of}} the first group of {{scientists}} to use that institution's new 600 MeV synchrocyclotron. Using this particle accelerator he helped to make a significant discovery which confirmed an aspect of the V-A Theory of weak interactions. <b>Supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>from</b> the Guggenheim Foundation, in 1968 he also spent a year as a Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford.|$|E
2500|$|... "Crossings: Getting Over, Around, and Through Water in Franklin County" [...] is a {{temporary}} exhibit at the museum that opened on June 4, 2017 and will run through August 20, 2017. The exhibit explores the relationship that Franklin County has with water, especially the Marais des Cygnes river. A central feature of the exhibit is a 34 foot map of the Marais des Cygnes which encompasses {{the floor of the}} exhibit. The exhibit {{is part of a larger}} initiative to focus on the relationship between people and water, and was <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>from</b> the Kansas Humanities Council to achieve that goal.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{previous}} scholars had {{defended the}} birth of Michael in Tudela in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but never with the theory of [...] "Servetus" [...] being a pseudonym. The established academic consensus on {{the matter is that}} he was born in Villanueva de Sijena, in the neighbouring region of Aragon, as Servetus himself claimed in his early works and during the whole trial at Geneva; but with no documents, as stated in the judgement that ultimately led him to his death at the stake. Scholarly debate may be tarnished by local and regional interests, because González and some other scholars claim that the true reason behind the non-acceptance of these new works by several institutions studying Servetus has to do more with his line of research on the identity of Michael, and his consequent different birthplace, which would be highly inconvenient for these institutions, with many trustees and members from Villanueva de Sijena, or even located there. González (Aragonese, born in Zaragoza, where he stayed until he obtained his baccalaureate) lives and works in Tudela, where he claims that [...] "De Villanueva" [...] was actually born, and his research on the 10 new works by Servetus has been <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>grant</b> <b>from</b> the Health Department of the regional government of Navarre, but even while he was still defending his birthplace in Aragon, for he had not done any research on his identity. In a similar way events on this issue organized in Villanueva de Sijena and in Zaragoza have been supported by the regional government of Aragon.|$|E
