5|$|The game is {{a simple}} forward-scrolling rail shooter, similar to the Star Fox series. Only the Game Boy Advance's {{directional}} pad, A, and Start buttons are used during gameplay. The ship remains locked at a <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> and cannot brake or speed up.|$|E
5|$|Released in September 2009, the E Series 2 HSV GTS {{incorporated}} {{a more powerful}} motor and drivetrain than other HSV models. It retains the same GM LS3 6.2L V8 engine but {{while the rest of}} the HSV range still have 317kW or 425bhp, the GTS engine is rated at (325kW). Twin bonnet scoops have returned to this model from the styling of the Pontiac G8. Other changes include the availability of launch control on manual versions, a recalibrated version of the magnetic ride control suspension with stiffer springs for the HSV GTS, wider wheels and a new high-flow dual-mode muffler system that produces a throatier roar under heavy acceleration. The E-Series 2 stability control system also has a Competition setting which allows for more wheel slip for special track or motorsport applications. The cruise control brakes the car when it is travelling downhill to ensure its speed stays within one per cent of the <b>set</b> <b>speed.</b> This model has daytime running lights.|$|E
25|$|The 1925 Act also granted {{powers to}} order the removal or {{alteration}} of buildings, trees and hedges causing obstruction or danger, introduced a licensing system for the erection of petrol pumps and introduced powers to <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> limits and to regulate signposts.|$|E

50|$|The State Traffic Commission {{typically}} <b>sets</b> <b>speed</b> limits following {{engineering studies}} performed by CONNDOT. Data used in <b>setting</b> <b>speed</b> limits includes traffic volume vs. roadway capacity, design speed, road geometry, the spacing of intersections and/or interchanges, {{the number of}} driveways and curb cuts, and accident rates.|$|R
30|$|In Sweden, the {{institutional}} framework for formally <b>setting</b> and changing <b>speed</b> limits within the road network {{consists of three}} types of regulatory guidelines. These are the Highway Code [8], specific regulations developed by the Swedish Transport Administration, and local traffic regulations issued by county administrations and municipalities. Specifically, municipalities have formal responsibility for <b>setting</b> <b>speed</b> limits within urban areas, while the Swedish Transport Administration has formal authority for <b>setting</b> <b>speed</b> limits on longer stretches for other roads such as rural roads and highways.|$|R
25|$|The SLR {{features}} active aerodynamics; {{there is}} a spoiler mounted on the rear integral air brake flap. The spoiler increases downforce depending on its angle of elevation (angle of attack). At a <b>set</b> <b>speed,</b> the spoiler/brake automatically raises to 10degrees (15degrees in the 722 edition), when demanded via the driver's switch, the elevation can be increased to 30degrees (35degrees in the 722 version) for increased rear downforce, {{at the cost of}} increased steady state drag.|$|E
25|$|In another design, {{a rubber}} housing is {{fitted with a}} {{pressure}} relief valve that determines {{the speed of a}} vehicle. If the vehicle is traveling below the <b>set</b> <b>speed,</b> the valve opens allowing the bump to deflate as the vehicle drives over it, but it remains closed if the vehicle is traveling too fast. The valve can also be set to allow heavy vehicles, such as fire trucks, ambulances, and buses to cross at higher speeds.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, the new joint company, Daimler-Benz, {{with their}} mighty Mercedes-Benz Silver Arrows, {{dominated}} Grand Prix racing in Europe together with its rival, Auto Union. In fact the colour of the cars, which was later to become legendary, was unintentional - they had initially been painted white as was traditional for German cars, but the paint was stripped away to reduce weight. The cars <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> records up to 435km/h (270mph). The team {{was guided by}} the great Rennleiter (racing team manager) Alfred Neubauer until the company ceased racing {{at the start of}} WWII.|$|E

30|$|Representatives of {{the road}} safety {{perspective}} also express how they are marginalized in the decision-making procedures that guide the planning of major new infrastructural investments, which include <b>setting</b> <b>speed</b> limits for newly built roads. For example, several of the municipal planners {{feel that they have}} limited influence over <b>setting</b> <b>speed</b> limits in the context of major new road projects. Such major projects {{are not part of the}} “normal activity” of everyday practice and are often organized as unique projects beyond the jurisdiction of ordinary municipal planning activities—and therefore beyond the control of municipal planners.|$|R
25|$|The {{automatic}} brake works by monitoring the speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a brake valve, and the brakes operate. The {{automatic brake}} can only be released after the train has come to a stop, and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the automatic brake is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|E
500|$|Otto Wilhelm Rudolf Caracciola (30 January 1901 – 28 September 1959), more {{commonly}} Rudolf Caracciola (...) , was a racing driver from Remagen, Germany. He won the European Drivers' Championship, the pre-1950 {{equivalent of the}} modern Formula One World Championship, an unsurpassed three times. He also won the European Hillclimbing Championship three times – twice in sports cars, and once in Grand Prix cars. Caracciola raced for Mercedes-Benz during their original dominating Silver Arrows period, named after the silver colour of the cars, and <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> records for the firm. He was affectionately dubbed Caratsch by the German public, and was known by the title of Regenmeister, or [...] "Rainmaster", for his prowess in wet conditions.|$|E
500|$|Special effects {{supervisor}} Burt Dalton and stunt coordinator Mic Rodger {{created the}} battle weapons {{used in the}} final scenes. The trebuchet, used by prisoners to throw rocks, was capable of throwing a [...] rock a distance of [...] with an accuracy of ten feet around the target. The water cannon {{had the power to}} shoot [...] of water per second. Some of the cast did their own stunts, including Mark Ruffalo, who performed one scene hanging from a helicopter. Interiors of the helicopter were not created with blue screen effects; instead, a special gimbal was used to hold a full-sized Huey-A type military helicopter. The gimbal was capable of rotating the helicopter 360degrees and vertically moving it 20feet. The gimbal was controlled by a computer, allowing Dalton to precisely <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> and movement; this ensured precise repeatability for multiple takes.|$|E

30|$|In most European countries, {{the often}} {{difficult}} policy process of <b>setting</b> and implementing <b>speed</b> limits on specific roads is delegated to public administration on {{local and regional}} levels. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe and analyze the perspectives and priorities of regional actors, specifically planners and elected officials within public administration, concerning their everyday work in <b>setting</b> <b>speed</b> limits within a Swedish county.|$|R
500|$|To address {{concerns}} about previous races, during which spectators crowding {{too close to}} the track had been killed or injured by cars, the ACF erected [...] of palisade fencing around the circuit, concentrated around towns and villages, and at the ends of lanes, footpaths and roads intersecting the track. The planking used to avoid the towns of Saint-Calais and Vibraye was installed {{as an alternative to the}} system used in the Gordon Bennett races, where cars passing through towns would slow down to a <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> and were forbidden to overtake. Several footbridges were erected over the track, and a 2,000-seat canopied grandstand was built at the start and finish line at Montfort. This faced the pit lane on the other side of the track, where the teams were based and could work on the cars. A tunnel under the track connected the grandstand and the pit lane. The road surface was little more than compacted dust and sharp stones which could be easily kicked up by the cars, and to limit the resulting problem of impaired visibility and punctures the ACF sealed the entire length of the track with tar. More was added to the bends of the track after cars running on them during practice broke up the surface.|$|E
500|$|At age two, Secretariat {{finished}} fourth in his 1972 debut in a maiden race, but then won seven of his remaining eight starts, including five stakes victories. His only loss {{during this period}} was in the Champagne Stakes, where he finished first but was disqualified to second for interference. He received the Eclipse Award for champion two-year-old colt, and also was the 1972 Horse of the Year, a rare honor for a horse so young. [...] At age three, Secretariat not only won the Triple Crown, he <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> records in all three races. His time in the Kentucky Derby still stands as the Churchill Downs track record for [...] miles, and {{his time in the}} Belmont Stakes stands as the American record for [...] miles on the dirt. His controversial time in the Preakness Stakes was eventually recognized as a stakes record in 2012. Secretariat's win in the Gotham Stakes tied the track record for 1 mile, he set a world record in the Marlboro Cup at [...] miles and further proved his versatility by winning two major stakes races on turf. He lost three times that year: in the Wood Memorial, Whitney and Woodward Stakes, but the brilliance of his nine wins made him an American icon. He won his second Horse of the Year title, plus Eclipse Awards for champion three-year-old colt and champion turf horse.|$|E
500|$|Hill raced an {{all white}} blown-fuel {{hydroplane}} from 1978 to 1984. He won 55 of 103 races during that time. Hill captured four American Drag Boat Association (ADBA) championships {{and was the}} SDBA top points earner in five consecutive years. In 1982, his Top Fuel hydroplane went [...] at an NDBA event to set the world's record for a quarter mile water drag at Chowchilla, California. It was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records, {{and it was not}} broken for 10years. Hill also <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> records that year in the SDBA (220.76mph), ADBA (215.82mph), and International Hot Boat Association (IHBA) (212.78mph). He became the only racer to hold records in all four associations simultaneously. [...] He won the NDBA Nationals four times including three straight from 1982 until 1984. In 1983 and 1984, Hill won the World Series of Drag Boat Racing championship. The series features two races {{in each of the four}} major drag boat racing sanctioning bodies. He won 17 races between 1983 and 1984, and made 29 of 34final rounds. [...] Before he quit boat drag racing, he had an elapsed time of 5.16seconds in the wet quarter mile at Firebird Lake in Chandler, Arizona. The e.t. was quicker than Gary Beck's 5.39-second NHRA Top Fuel dragster record, the first time that the water record was lower than the land record. Hill quit boat racing in October 1984 after a crash at 217miles per hour. [...] "It was a perfect run," [...] Hill recalled. [...] "I started to settle the boat back into the water, and then it took off." [...] His Texas A ring was torn off his hand; he suffered seven broken bones, a concussion, & eye injuries. He spent five days in the hospital and was not fully recovered for a year.|$|E
50|$|The rate {{at which}} pattern data is played is defined by a <b>speed</b> <b>setting.</b> Each row in the pattern data lasts one {{vertical}} blanking (or 0.02 seconds) times the current <b>speed</b> <b>setting.</b> The <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> varied from 1 to 255.In later versions of the format, the vertical blanking was replaced with an adjustable time period staying in the range 0.078 seconds. The old <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> command was replaced with a new one {{that was used to}} change both the old <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> and the new adjustable time period. Unfortunately, some of the old functionality was broken, because the new <b>speed</b> <b>setting</b> command had an identical code value to the old command. Values in the range 31 were interpreted as the old speed settings, but other values were regarded as modifications to the adjustable time period. Hence, values in the range 255 used in some old songs broke in new versions of the player.|$|R
50|$|Significant {{changes were}} made to the rules for <b>setting</b> <b>speed</b> limits in 2003 and 2011, {{including}} provision for 40 km/h limits. However, it was then necessary to introduce the Land Transport (Speed Limits Validation) Bill in 2015 to confirm the legitimacy of the previous changes.|$|R

2500|$|In {{practical}} terms it automatically applies accurate and responsive correction to a control function.

2500|$|The {{system is}} set up so that at any time the {{steering}} wheel is touched or the brake firmly pressed, the automatic parking will disengage. The vehicle also cannot exceed a <b>set</b> <b>speed,</b> or the system will deactivate.

2500|$|Speed {{control on}} the subway is ensured by [...] "Time Signals". A timer is started {{as soon as the}} train passes a certain point and will clear the signal ahead as soon as the {{predefined}} time elapsed; the minimum time is calculated from the speed limit and the distance between start of timer and signal. [...] "Time Signals" [...] are distinguished into [...] "Grade Timer" [...] for speed supervision at grades, curves or in front of buffer stops, and in [...] "Station Timer" [...] to allow a following trains enter a station as another is leaving {{as long as they are}} going at a reduced speed. There are two types of Grade Time signals. The first time, [...] "two-shot timer," [...] are generally used on down grades where the train must be under a <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> for a longer length of track. [...] "One-shot timers," [...] on the other time are found at sharp curves.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic <b>Set</b> <b>Speed</b> Type: The dynamic <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> {{uses the}} GPS {{position}} of speed limit signs, from a database. Some are modifiable by the driver.

50|$|All {{cruise control}} systems must {{be capable of}} being turned off both {{explicitly}} and automatically when the driver depresses the brake, and often also the clutch. Cruise control often includes a memory feature to resume the <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> after braking, and a coast feature to reduce the <b>set</b> <b>speed</b> without braking. When the cruise control is engaged, the throttle can still be used to accelerate the car, but once the pedal is released the car will then slow down until it reaches the previously <b>set</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
