5|$|Beer is {{the oldest}} and most widely {{consumed}} alcoholic drink in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water and tea. Beer is brewed from cereal grains — most commonly from malted barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a natural preservative and <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agent.</b> Other flavouring agents such as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during processing and replaced with forced carbonation.|$|E
25|$|Technological {{innovations}} such {{as these}} have introduced various food additives into ice cream, the notable one being the <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agent</b> gluten, to which some people have an intolerance. Recent awareness of this issue has prompted a number of manufacturers to start producing gluten-free ice cream.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{problems}} with producing nanoparticles initially arise once these nanoparticles are generated in solution. Without {{the use of}} a <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agent,</b> nanoparticles tend to stick together once the stirring is stopped. In order to counteract this, a certain collidial stabilizer is generally added. These stabilizers bind to the nanoparticles in a way that prevents other particles from bonding with them. Some effective stabilizers found so far include citrate, cellulose, and sodium borohydride.|$|E
40|$|CdTe {{quantum dots}} (QDs) were {{prepared}} in aqueous phase using thioglycolic acid (TGA), L-cysteine(L-Cys), and glutathione (GSH) as <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agents.</b> The luminescent properties of CdTe QDs with different <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agents</b> were studied by using fluorescence spectra. FTIR spectra analysis demonstrates that CdTe QDs are capped with <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agents</b> through the coordination interaction between Cd 2 + and S. Fluorescence spectra show that CdTe QDs with longer emission wavelength (680 nm) can be synthesized more easily when L-Cys or GSH is chosen as <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agents</b> and TGA is proper to prepare highly luminescent QDs {{because of the}} effect between Cd 2 + and sulfhydryl group. The MTT assay and morphology analysis of U 87 MG cells suggest that the QDs with different <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agents</b> are all toxic to cells. The cytotoxicity of TGAQDs is {{higher than that of}} L-Cys- and GSH- CdTe. The cell viability is only 52. 6 % when U 87 MG cells are treated with 20 μg/mL of TGA-QDs for 24 h...|$|R

40|$|In {{the search}} for new soil <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agents</b> the effects of six organic cations on plastic limit, liquid limit, {{shrinkage}} limit, air-dry strength and rate of slaking of a highly plastic clay subsoil were studied. In all cases the plasticity index and shrinkage were reduced by the treatments. The air-dry strength was lowered in varying degree, which was the only undesirable effect noted. With one exception resistance to slaking was improved. It is concluded that large organic cations show promise as possible <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agents</b> for highly plastic fine-grained soils...|$|R
25|$|While an inexperienced rider {{may feel}} more secure with a {{slightly}} too-short stirrup, in reality, it is actually easier to be thrown from the horse because the rider's legs act as a <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agent,</b> much {{in the same way}} the long pole of a tightrope walker balances the acrobat. Obviously, a stirrup leather so long that a rider cannot reach it is useless, and a stirrup length that does not allow a rider with a properly positioned leg to keep the heel lower than the toe is also easily lost. However, shortening the stirrup until the rider feels they will not lose the stirrup is counterproductive; the goal of correct equestrianism is to make maximum use of the leg. Lengthening the leg creates a more secure seat, while shortening the stirrup is done only to accommodate the needs of the horse to perform athletic movement. Thus correct stirrup length creates a balance between control and mobility that fits the discipline performed.|$|E

2500|$|The oldest known use of {{bacterial}} cellulose is as {{the raw material}} of nata de coco, a traditional sweet candy dessert of the Philippines. It has also {{been used as a}} thickener to maintain the viscosity in food and as a <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agent.</b> [...] Due to its texture and fiber content, it has been added to many food products as a dietary fiber. A specific example is Cellulon ®, which is a bulking agent used as a food ingredient to act as a thickener, texturizer, and/or calorie reducer.

40|$|Poly(diallyl dimethylammonium) {{chloride}} (PDDA), {{an ordinary}} and watersoluble cationic polyelectrolyte, was investigated {{for its ability}} to generate and stabilize gold colloids from a chloroauric acid precursor. In this reaction, PDDA acted as both reducing and <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agents</b> for gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). More importantly, PDDA is a quaternary ammonium polyelectrolyte, which shows that the scope of the reducing and <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agents</b> for metal nanoparticles can be extended from the amine-containing molecules to quaternary ammonium polyelectrolytes or salts. UV-vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) were used to characterize the synthetic AuNPs. The PDDA-protected AuNPs obtained are very stable and have relative narrow size distribution...|$|R
40|$|Combined radiochemotherapy {{treatment}} modalities are in use {{for many}} indications and there-fore of high interest. Even though a combined modality in clinical use is often driven by prag-matic aspects, mechanistic preclinical-based concepts of interaction are of importance {{in order to}} translate and implement an optimal combination and scheduling of two modalities into the clinics. The use of microtubule <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agents</b> is a promising strategy for anti-cancer therapy {{as a part of}} combined treatment modality with ionizing radiation. Traditionally, microtubule targeting agents are classified as cytotoxic chemotherapeutics and are mostly used in a maxi-mally tolerated dose regimen. Apart from direct cytotoxicity and similar to mechanisms of mo-lecular targeting <b>agents,</b> microtubule <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agents</b> interfere with multiple cellular process-es, which can be exploited as part of combined treatment modalities. Recent preclinical investi-gations on the combination of ionizing radiation and microtubule <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agents</b> reveal new mechanistic interactions on the cellular and tumor level and elucidate the supra-additive tumor response observed particularly in vivo. The major focus on the mechanism of interaction was primarily based on radiosensitization due to cell cycle arrest in the most radiosensitive G 2 /M-phase of the cell cycle. However, other mechanisms of interaction such as reoxygenation and direct as well as indirect endothelial damage have also been identified. In this review we sum-marize and allocate additive and synergistic effects induced by the combined treatment of clini-cally relevant microtubule <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agents</b> and ionizing radiation along a described radiobio-logical framework encompassing distinct mechanisms relevant for exploiting the combination of drugs and ionizing radiation...|$|R

40|$|Biodegradable polymer nanocapsules {{containing}} the lipophilic sunscreen, Parsol MCX (OMC), as the oil core were prepared by solvent displacement. We investigated {{the influence of}} polysorbate 85 (P- 85) and poloxamer 188 (P- 188) as <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agents,</b> the OMC loading capacity and the photoprotective potential of the formulations. The formation of nanocapsules is probably due to an interfacial instability arising from rapid diffusion of the solvent across the interface. The effectiveness of the <b>stabilizing</b> <b>agents</b> was attributed {{to their ability to}} inhibit coalescence during solvent diffusion. P- 85 was a better stabilizer of poly(epsilon-Caprolactone) -nanocapsules than P- 188. The OMC loading capacity was high (99 +/- 1 % of OMC initial concentration). The in vitro release of OMC-nanocapsules is governed by hydrophobicity and crystallinity of the polymer and by the high lipophilicity of the drug. The OMC-nanocapsules provided partial protection against UV-induced erythema, in a manner significantly better than a conventional gel...|$|R
