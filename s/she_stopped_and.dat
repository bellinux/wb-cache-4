She also became the first Norwegian ship to apprehend a ship for illegal fishing when, on 11 March 1911, <b>she</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> took under arrest the 293-ton British fishing trawler Lord Roberts {{off the coast of}} Finnmark. Lord Roberts would go on to serve as naval trawler in the Royal Navy during the First World War. HMT Lord Roberts was mined and sunk off Shipwash, Harwich on 26 October 1916.|$|E

500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939, Brilliant {{was assigned to the}} 19th Destroyer Flotilla at Dover and spent the time before the Battle of France escorting convoys and minelaying operations. She collided with the breakwater at Dover on 12 September and required six weeks for repairs. On 12 May 1940, the ship took part in Operation XD, the destruction of Dutch port facilities and returned with 100 evacuees aboard. On 15 May Brilliant collided with her sister ship [...] en route for the Hook of Holland and was under repair at Sheerness Dockyard until 17 June. She was then transferred to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla at Dover, as the heavy losses suffered during the Dunkirk evacuation forced the disbandment of the 19th Flotilla. On 25 July, the ship engaged German E-boats off Dover Harbour together with Boreas and was badly damaged by German Junkers Ju 87 [...] "Stuka" [...] dive bombers after she was ordered to withdraw. Brilliant was attacked by eight [...] "Stuka"s and the ship was hit by two bombs that passed through the hull without exploding. No one was injured, but the steering gear was disabled and <b>she</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> flooded by the stern. The ship was lightened by jettisoning her aft guns and depth charges and was towed back to Dover. Brilliant was under repair at Chatham Dockyard until mid-October.|$|E
500|$|While VT-3 {{was still}} attacking Hiryū, American dive bombers arrived over the Japanese {{carriers}} almost undetected and began their dives. It {{was at this}} time, around 10:20, that {{in the words of}} Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully, the [...] "Japanese air defenses would finally and catastrophically fail". At 10:25, Sōryū was attacked by thirteen Dauntlesses from Bombing Squadron 2 (VB-2) from the Yorktown. The carrier received three direct hits from 1000 lb (454kg) bombs: one penetrated to the lower hangar deck amidships, and the other two exploded in the upper hangar deck fore and aft. The hangars contained armed and fueled aircraft preparing for the upcoming strike, resulting in secondary explosions and rupturing the steam pipes in the boiler rooms. Within a very short time the fires on the ship were out of control. At 10:40 <b>she</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> her crew was ordered to abandon ship five minutes later. The destroyers [...] and [...] rescued the survivors. Sōryū was still afloat and showed no signs of beginning to sink by early evening, so Isokaze was ordered to scuttle her with torpedoes so as to allow the destroyers to be used for possible operations that night. The destroyer reported at 19:15 that Sōryū had sunk at position [...] Losses were 711 crew of her complement of 1,103, including Captain Yanagimoto, who chose to remain on board. This was the highest mortality percentage of all the Japanese carriers lost at Midway, due largely to the devastation in both hangar decks.|$|E

Hans Christian Andersen, who had {{occasionally}} {{been invited}} to tell stories to Dagmar and her siblings when they were children, was among the crowd which flocked to the quay {{in order to see}} her off.

2500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the Olav Tryggvason took part in neutrality protection duties. Her first armed action came on 3 November 1939, when the US merchant ship City of Flint entered Norwegian territorial waters. The City of Flint had been taken as a prize by the German pocket battleship Deutschland in the Atlantic and {{was on its way to}} Germany with the American crew as prisoners. According to public international law, the ship could have passed through Norwegian waters without interference, but when <b>she</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> anchored in the port of Haugesund, the Germans broke Norwegian neutrality regulations. The German prize crew had brought the City of Flint into Haugesund to escape the British naval forces which searched for them. When the British cruiser [...] approached the City of Flint on 2 November the escorting Olav Tryggvason had confronted the British warship and made it leave Norwegian waters. Olav Tryggvason boarded the City of Flint with one officer and thirty armed sailors, who returned control of the ship to the American captain, Joseph H. Gainard, on 6 November. He unloaded his cargo in Bergen and set sail in ballast for the US. The German prize crew was interned at Kongsvinger Fortress. In response, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs received several strongly worded and threatening notes from its German counterpart.|$|E
