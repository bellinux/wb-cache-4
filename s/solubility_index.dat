50|$|Textured {{soy protein}} (TSP) {{is made by}} forming a dough from high {{nitrogen}} <b>solubility</b> <b>index</b> (NSI) defatted soy flour with water in a screw-type extruder, and heating with or without steam. The dough is extruded through a die into various possible shapes: granules, flakes, chunks, goulash, steakettes (schnitzel), etc., and dried in an oven. TSP made from soy flour contains 50% soy protein and must be rehydrated before use at a weight ratio of 1 TSP:2 water. However, TSP, when made from soy concentrate, contains 70% protein and can be rehydrated {{at a ratio of}} 1:3. It {{can be used as a}} meat replacement or supplement. The extrusion technology changes the structure of the soy protein, resulting in a fibrous, spongy matrix similar in texture to meat.|$|E

40|$|Modified {{starches}} find specialty uses in both {{food and}} industrial applications. In this study, starch esters were synthesized by extruding 70 % amylose starch with fatty acid anhydrides and sodium hydroxide (catalyst) {{in a single}} screw extruder. Acetic, propionic, heptanoic, and palmitic anhydrides were used at 0. 01, 0. 02, and 0. 03 mol levels to obtain different degrees of substitution (DS) in the starch. Physical properties of the extrudates such as unit and solid density, specific mechanical energy, water absorption and water <b>solubility</b> <b>indices,</b> as well as molecular degradation and DS of the starch, were measured. DS increased {{as the level of}} anhydride increased. Lower molecular weights and higher levels of anhydride resulted in the greatest reduction in starch molecular weight. ^ Modified starches also were produced in a batch process and then extruded. Starch acetate with degrees of substitution of 2 and 3 were extruded with either water or ethanol in a single screw extruder. Starch acetate with degree of substitution of 3 was extruded with either 16 or 18 % (db) ethanol in a single screw extruder at 120 and 160 °C. Physical properties of the extrudates such as unit and solid density, specific mechanical energy, water absorption and water <b>solubility</b> <b>indices,</b> as well as molecular degradation and degree of substitution (DS) of the starch, were measured. It was established that samples extruded with organic solvent such as ethanol, and at higher temperatures, had mechanical properties closer to commercial foam materials than samples extruded with water and samples extruded at lower temperatures.

40|$|Relationships {{between the}} {{structural}} properties of raw. and extruded com starches and their functionalities were investigated using mixtures of these starch types. Extruded starch had higher water absorption and water <b>solubility</b> <b>indices,</b> and produced lower RVA viscosity profiles {{when compared with}} raw starch. It also had no differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) endotherm. Gel cohesiveness and adhesiveness of both starch types were similar, while extruded starch gels were softer. Extruded starch produced lower Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA) viscosity profiles than raw starch due to starch degradation during extrusion. The raw and extruded starch components bad negative interaction coefficients, thus RVA viscosity parameters were lowered as the fraction of extruded starch in the mixture increased. Starch degradation in the extruded starch was a likely significant factor associated with low viscosity profiles.

40|$|Corn {{starches}} {{with different}} physical structures were studied {{to understand their}} physico-chemical and functional properties. A novel continuous starch annealing process was developed. An optimum com starch annealing end temperature and heating rate were calculated to be 59 °C and 0. 67 °C/h, respectively; enthalpy (14. 2 J/g) and onset temperature (69. 0 °C) were maximized while holding relative percent crystallinity unchanged (52. 4 %). When these mathematically determined conditions were tested, actual and calculated results for DSC gelatinization enthalpy and onset temperature, and % relative crystallinity were similar. Relationships between the structural properties of raw, swollen, annealed and gelatinized starches and their functionalities were investigated using mixtures of these starch types. Raw, swollen and annealed starches were similar in their water absorption <b>indices,</b> water <b>solubility</b> <b>indexes</b> and percent relative crystallinities. Although the enthalpy values for raw, swollen and annealed starches were similar, gelatinization peaks for swollen and annealed starches were wider and narrower, respectively, than that for raw starch. Gelatinized starch had no DSC peak. Cooked annealed and cooked raw starches made the hardest gels. Gelatinized starch resulted in higher RVA viscosity profiles relative to the other starch structures. When gelatinized starch was mixed with the other starch structures, however, it decreased peak and final viscosities, breakdown, and setback. The relationships between the structural properties of raw and extruders corn starches and their functionalities were also investigated using mixtures of these starch types. The extruded starch sample had higher water absorption and water <b>solubility</b> <b>indices</b> than the raw starch sample (WSI: 24. 6 % vs. 0. 96 %, WAI: 4. 98 g/g vs. 1. 78 g/g). There was no DSC endotherm observed for the extruded starch. Cohesiveness and adhesiveness of gels from both raw and extruded starches were similar, while extruded starch made softer gels. Extruded starch produced lower RVA viscosity profiles than raw starch. When extruded and raw starches were mixed, the responses were not always linear. Negative interactions between raw and extruded starches were observed for the viscosity parameters. As extruded starch content increased in the mixture, the mixture viscosity profile decreased, due to starch degradation in the extruded starch. ...|$|R

40|$|Starch {{is a type}} of carbohydrate, {{consumed}} within foods or added into foods {{after being}} isolated from its source. It also can be modified and then added into food products. One of the modifications of starch, cross-linking, improves its thickening properties. Starch is modified not only for food but also industrial purposes. The concept of incorporating starch into plastic products also requires modification of starch because of its negative effects on water absorption and solubility of starch-plastic composite. ^ Cross-linking of starch in a batch system takes a long time and requires a drying process. Cross-linking of starch by reactive extrusion can reduce reaction time and eliminate the need for a drying process. The objectives of this study were to cross-link starch with phosphorus in an extruder, thereby reducing water absorption and solubility of starch. ^ In the first part, starch was extruded with water, 0. 2 M sodium hydroxide and 2. 5 % sodium trimetaphosphate. The effects of moisture content of the feed and screw speed of the extruder on mean residence time, phosphorylation of starch, water absorption index, and water <b>solubility</b> <b>index</b> of starch were examined. Cross-linking of starch, with incorporated phosphorus, was confirmed by paste viscosity measurement. Minimum reaction time, adjusted by moisture content of feed and screw speed, for cross-linking of starch was determined.

A rotatable central-composite design (CCD) {{was used to}} develop models for the objective responses. The experiments were run at barrels temperatures 160, 160, 165, and 165 degrees C, respectively, with screw speed 40 rpm and complete feeding (filling ratio - 1). Responses were most affected by changes in plasticizer level (X 2) {{and to a lesser extent}} by glycerol level (X 1). Individual contour plots of the different responses were overlaid, and regions meeting the predicted optimum water <b>solubility</b> <b>index</b> of 4. 34 %, water absorption index of 4. 55 g gel/g dry wt, and Max. loading of 370. 06 N were identified at the plasticizer level of 21. 06 g, and the glycerol level of 96. 11 mL, respectively.

After sedimentation of this effluent is recovered a wet residual pulp, and after drying is obtained dry residual pulp or simply named {{in this study}} residual pulp of potato (RPP). In order to convert the effluent into a material easy to store for long periods (such as the potato starch), {{which would make it}} suitable for various applications. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of the drying conditions, specifically variables temperature and air flow on the drying time and water activity, pH, titratable acidity, instrumental colour parameters, water absorption index, water <b>solubility</b> <b>index</b> and oil absorption capacity of dry RPP. Central Composite Design was used, with temperature levels from 50. 0 to 70. 0 °C and air flow from 0. 06 to 0. 092 m 3 m– 2 s– 1. Temperature and airflow affected the study characteristics, except for lightness (L*), water <b>solubility</b> <b>index</b> and oil absorption capacity. It was concluded that milder conditions (lower temperatures) and intermediate air flow resulted in higher-quality final products (lighter, less acidic), although requiring higher drying time. Therefore, depending on the product application, different drying conditions can be used...|$|E

40|$|A {{fractional}} {{factorial design}} with a replicated central composite point {{was used to}} investigate the effects of extrusion processing on physical properties of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) based aquafeeds using a twin-screw extruder. Extrusion cooking trials were performed with a nutritionally balanced ingredient blend for Nile tilapia, with two levels of screw speed (350 and 450 rpm), two levels of extruder water (0. 236 and 0. 302 kg/min), and two levels of conditioner steam (0. 1 and 0. 15 kg/min). The central point was 400 rpm screw speed, 0. 271 kg/min extruder water, and 0. 12 kg/min conditioner steam. Effects of these processing conditions on extrudate characteristics were extensively analyzed and included moisture content, water activity, thermal properties, expansion ratio, unit density, bulk density, color, water stability, sinking velocity, water absorption and <b>solubility</b> <b>indices,</b> and pellet durability index. Increasing the extruder water and conditioner steam resulted in a 5. 3 % decrease and nearly 8. 6 % rise in mass flow rate, respectively. As screw speed increased from 350 to 400 rpm, water stability and water activity increased by 13 and 58 %, respectively. Increasing extruder water from 0. 236 to 0. 302 kg/min led to {{a significant increase in}} water stability by 12. 5 % and decreases in water absorption index, water activity, and expansion ratio by 13, 21, and 5. 5 %, respectively. As conditioner steam increased from 0. 1 to 0. 15 kg/min, sinking velocity and water absorption index decreased by 25 and 15 %, respectively. Increasing conditioner steam from 0. 1 to 0. 12 kg/min resulted in 20, 5. 5, 10, and 3 % decreases in moisture content of the extrudates, brightness (L*), water stability, and expansion ratio, respectively. It also increased bulk density by 5. 8 % and unit density by 4. 2 %. Overall, all trials produced viable extrudates with properties appropriate for Nile tilapia feeding...|$|R
