The {{objective is to}} minimize the flood risk under the worst case of the design storm within the budget constraints. Design storms in current and future climate scenarios are analyzed as input to the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). Then, LID practices are selected based on the proposed procedure and a <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> <b>model</b> is built to identify the optimal LID layouts using the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. The lower and upper bounds of the generated rainfall intensities of a five-year 1 -h duration design storms for the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2 for the atmosphere and oceans (HadGEM 2 -AO), the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM 1 -ME), and the CSIRO-Mk 3. 6. 0 Atmosphere-Ocean GCM (CSIRO-Mk 3. 6. 0) during 2021 – 2040 are derived. The LID selection helps efficiently identify appropriate LID. Results show that nearly no flood occurs under the optimal LID layouts found by the LID <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> <b>model.</b> Moreover, it is more optimal to invest in LID in the lower sub-catchments in LID planning when the budget is limited. These methods are generally applicable for a community using LIDs as adaptation measures against pluvial flooding...|$|E

40|$|Spatial Planning and Social Justice: {{the paradox}} of {{regional}} decentralization {{and its impact on}} the region of Aysén (Chilean Patagonia) " ABSTRACT The following research focuses on the problem of the <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> <b>model</b> implemented in Chile -through top-down strategies- during the last forty years, where decentralization has become an almost unreachable task. The concentration of decision-making processes in the central government, and the increasing social and economic inequalities between the fourteen regions and the metropolis of Santiago, have led to a wave of social movements from north to south of the country. The specific case of the social movement of Aysén represented a wake-up call for society, where citizens achieved to organize themselves and demand the integration of their own opinions in decision-making processes in what concerns the territory they inhabit. This movement claimed for the vindication of Aysén as a historically forgotten region by the central government. In other words, the latter calls for spatial justice and recognition of its particularities as a peripheral region. Key words: spatial planning, regionalisation, decentralisation, spatial justice, social movement, Chilean Patagonia. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} risk of {{floods in}} Europe {{calls for a}} revision of current governance and management practices. Sweden has not yet experienced flood events of the magnitude seen in central Europe {{over the past few}} years; hence flood-risk management is low on its political agenda. This paper investigates the gaps, barriers and opportunities in implementation of flood risk reduction, which to be effective needs to be part of an adaptive river basin management framework. It analyses progress on the ground illustrated by a case study from Kristianstad, the most flood-exposed municipality in Sweden. We conducted a literature review, interviews, a regional workshop and a focus group discussion. The results show that structural flood-control measures dominate in the municipality, mainly due to the prevalence of sectoral approaches, which are reinforced at the national level. There is no integrated and holistic <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> <b>model</b> for flood risk management that takes water resources management and green infrastructure into account at the river basin scale. The local planning level therefore needs guidance on a broader set of measures to manage flood risk across sectors. Also, reliance on expert opinion needs to be complemented by strengthened stake-holder participation in the spatial planning process. Future opportunities include synergies between the EU Water Framework Directive and Flood Directive guided by national priorities...|$|E

The global market demand on marine economic species has been initiated the exploitation of the marine species which will become the hindrance in maintaining the sustainable marine biodiversity. Besides that, the degradation of marine species will also become the problem for traditional fishermen. Therefore, a model has to be employed to spatially manage the coastal waters as the alternative for fishermen activities during closed seasons, such as floating fish net culture.   The {{aim of this study}} was to develop marine <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> <b>model</b> based on ecological approach in order to identify the potentiality of marine waters for marine culture such as floating fish net culture. The method for the model consisted of social assessment using the Delphi for developing the rule of marine planning for floating fish net culture and the spatial analysis technique for determining the model of marine {{spatial planning}} for floating fish net culture. The area of Kupang Bay waters, East Nusa Tenggara was used as the study area. The result indicated that the model can be used to sustainable marine spatial planning, especially for floating fish net culture.

40|$|We {{develop a}} <b>spatial</b> {{electricity}} <b>planning</b> <b>model</b> to guide grid expansion {{in countries with}} low pre-existing electricity coverage. The model {{can be used to}} rapidly estimate connection costs and compare different regions and communities. Inputs that are modeled include electricity demand, costs, and geographic characteristics. The spatial nature of the model permits accurate representation of the existing electricity network and population distribution, which form the basis for future expansion decisions. The methodology and model assumptions are illustrated using country-specific data from Kenya. Results show that under most geographic conditions, extension of the national grid is less costly than off-grid options. Based on realistic penetration rates for Kenya, we estimate an average connection cost of $ 1900 per household, with lower-cost connection opportunities around major cities and in denser rural regions. In areas with an adequate pre-existing medium-voltage backbone, we estimate that over 30 % of households could be connected for less than $ 1000 per connection through infilling. The penetration rate, an exogenous factor chosen by electricity planners, is found to have a large effect on household connection costs, often outweighing socio-economic and spatial factors such as inter-household distance, per-household demand, and proximity to the national grid.

40|$|This {{graduation}} thesis tackles {{the issue}} of airport-driven urban development in the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area context. Initially planned outside of cities for security and pollution reasons airports are now attracting urban development in their proximity. This development consisting of hotels, office spaces or congress centres {{is driven by the}} benefits of a location providing a fast connection to an airport with a large variety of flight destinations. This phenomena is linked to a time based competition business model in which the speed with which companies reach their world spread customer base is vital for their performance (Kasarda, 2000). Through the large flows of people and goods that they attract airports are becoming regional nodes of activity in their city regions. Multiple authors indicate the need for the development of new conceptual frameworks that would help better understand the complex urban interactions triggered by airports on a regional scale (Freestone and Baker, 2011, Salewski et al., 2012, Schaafsma, 2009, Schlaak, 2009, Knippenberger, 2010). Through this thesis I am proposing an alternative spatial development strategy for the area between Schiphol Airport and Amsterdam. The strategy aims to integrate the airport related urban networks in a regional vision which takes into consideration spatial, demographic and economic trends specific to the Amsterdam Metropolitan Area. Moreover the strategy aims to provide solutions for the local urban integration of airport related business parks. My vision for the area is to develop Amsterdamse Bos as a metropolitan park with an urban edge providing a living and working environment in an international context. Existing <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> <b>models</b> of airport-driven urban development are not yet sufficiently developed. I therefore chose to use network urbanism theories in order to explain and propose future development strategies on a regional and local scale. The thesis ends with an evaluation of the proposed strategy and of the suitability of a network urbanism approach within this context. <b>Spatial</b> <b>Planning</b> and Strategy ChairUrbanismArchitectur...|$|R

The review presented here is broader in both scope and depth (more analysis within <b>spatial</b> forest <b>planning</b> <b>models).</b> We conduct here a world-wide literature review and extensive analysis of the status and trends {{over the past two}} decades in <b>spatial</b> forest <b>planning.</b> In our investigation, we hope to understand the roles of objective and constraint functions in <b>spatial</b> forest <b>planning.</b> The literature review results suggest that methods used in forest planning have shifted somewhat from exact analytical solution techniques to heuristic techniques. In an effort to incorporate complex relationship into forest plans, other solution methods have also been evaluated for adoption in the planning process. Besides the economic and commodity production objectives, there is a noticeable increase in the proportion of ecological and social concerns in objective functions. In Europe, multi-parameter objective functions now seem to be in vogue, containing little or no constraints. In the U. S., single-parameter objective functions are still common, with multiple concerns recognized as constraints. In addition to the economic and commodity production constraints, adjacency and green-up relationships have recently been considered as important constraints in many areas of the world. Vector data are found to be more popular than raster data in the forest planning process, particularly in real-life applications of methods. In theoretical applications of methods...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to build a bridge between climate change {{adaptation}} and <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> and design. It aims to develop a <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> framework in which the properties of climate adaptation and <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> are unified. Design/methodology/approach - Adaptive and dynamical approaches in <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> literature are studied and climate adaptation properties are defined in a way they can be used in a <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> framework. The climate adaptation properties and <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> features are aggregated in coherent groups and used to construct the <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> framework, which subsequently has been tested to design a climate adaptive region. Findings - The paper concludes that the majority of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> methods do not include adaptive or dynamic strategies derived from complex adaptive systems theory, such as adaptive capacity or vulnerability. If these complex adaptive systems properties are spatially defined and aggregated in a coherent set of spatial groups, they can form a <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> framework for climate adaptation. Each of these groups has a specific time dimension and can be linked to a specific <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> "layer". The set of (five) layers form the <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> framework, which can be used as a methodology to design a climate adaptive region. Originality/value - Previous research did not connect the complex issue of climate change with <b>spatial</b> <b>planning.</b> Many frameworks are developed in climate change research but are generally not aiming to meet the needs of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning.</b> This article forms the first attempt to develop a <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> framework, in which non‐linear and dynamical processes, such as climate adaptation, is included...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} based on the problem of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> in France. The first part is the general characteristics of France and its land use. The part about the system of French <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> consists of a description of the history, from which the French <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> gets its direction. Then there is a list of authorities and institutions of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> with their essential characterization. The last part dealing with France is a summary of instruments used in <b>spatial</b> <b>planning.</b> The next part focuses on the Czech Republic and its <b>spatial</b> <b>planning.</b> It includes a historical chapter of Czech spacial planning. Next we find a structure of authorities and insitutions and, again, the instruments of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning.</b> In term of the two analyses, I have made a comparison of these two systems of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning.</b> I have found some interesting correspondences as well as some differences...|$|R
40|$|The aim of my {{graduation}} theses is {{the analysis}} of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> legislation in the Czech Republic between 1945 and present. In the theoretical part I have explained basic terms and the legal regulation of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> and I have presented individual concepts of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> legislation since 1945. Besides the comparison of the basic concepts of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning,</b> the practical part mainly deals with {{the analysis of}} the relation of <b>spatial</b> and strategic <b>plans.</b> I have defined the main differences between these documents and compared whether it is advantageous for the municipality to start with a <b>spatial</b> <b>plan</b> or a strategic plan. Furthermore, I have focused on the creation and the content of the <b>spatial</b> <b>plan</b> of Domažlice, focusing on the compliance of legislation in the area of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning,</b> as well as {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} current legislation and the weaknesses of the <b>spatial</b> <b>plan</b> in Domažlice. Finally, I have indicated my own suggestions on how to improve the situation...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> system currently {{mandatory in}} Poland, {{as well as}} main changes concerning the principles of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> and man-agement in Poland after the system transformation. The work addresses particu-larly the issues of de-centralization of public administration and establishing commune self-governments, socialization of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning,</b> protection of private property and also the obligation to consider appropriate instruments of natural protection {{in the process of}} <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> and management. The paper presents also the basic principles of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> in the United States of America and points out the similarities and differences between the methods, procedures and as-sumptions of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> systems in both countries. The work presents poten-tial areas of cooperation between both universities comprising sharing knowledge and exchanging experiences in the filed of <b>spatial</b> <b>planning</b> and management...|$|R
