5|$|During the 1980s, {{the airport}} was again deemed too small. In 1983, all charter flights {{operated}} by SAS and Braathens {{were forced to}} move to Gardermoen. Additional foreign services were introduced, namely Sabena to Brussels in 1985, Dan-Air to London-Gatwick and Newcastle in 1986 and Alitalia to Milan in 1988. During a period of reconstruction at Gardermoen, Trans World Airlines also served Fornebu, and the same year Pan American reintroduced its route to New York. Air Europe also started to fly from London-Gatwick to Fornebu. An additional storey {{was added to the}} <b>service</b> <b>building,</b> allowing office space to be moved there and free up space for check-in and traveler service on the two main storeys. Two satellites were built for the domestic terminal, one each for Braathens SAFE and SAS, allowing increased waiting area for travelers. The international terminal was expanded with a five-gate pier with jetbridges. A multi-story parking house was also built.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Finnair started {{flying to}} Helsinki, {{although}} direct flights were not introduced until 1971. After 1962, the east–west runway became the main runway. Along with the runway expansion, a new <b>service</b> <b>building,</b> with {{a capacity for}} 2million passengers, was opened in 1964. It was located about half a kilometer (quarter of a mile) south of the former terminal. Designed by Odd Nansens Arkitektkontor, it had two stories, one for arrivals and one for departures, and two wings, one for domestic and one for international flights. It included a central hall that had a panorama view over the aircraft. The expanded facilities allowed SAS to take into use Sud Aviation Caravelle jets on the Copenhagen routes, although they were also occasionally used to Bodø.|$|E

5|$|L.F. Wade International Airport {{sustained}} some {{roof and}} runway lighting damage, and the Bermuda Weather <b>Service</b> <b>building</b> lost a storm shutter and saw water forced inside a communications room. A restaurant {{at the site}} of the Gibbs Hill Lighthouse was severely damaged, requiring a complete roof replacement. The Causeway was largely spared, with some damage to the safety walls alongside the road, and it was partially reopened on October 18 after initial repairs. However, one of two lanes remained shut down for several days. Many boats were washed ashore and damaged or wrecked by the storm, and other vessels tipped over in boatyards. According to preliminary estimates, properties in the Dockyard alone incurred US$1 million (2014 BMD) in damage.|$|E
