5|$|The song's video {{features}} close-up {{shots of}} Beyoncé and incorporates psychedelic light effects and symmetrical filming photography. As the acoustic guitar begins playing, Beyoncé's face comes into view. She stands with {{her blond hair}} draped just below her exposed shoulders. As she intently <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> the camera, her skin glistens as though it has been coated with a honey-like and glittery substance. Turning her head from right to left, with her eyes fixed off-camera, Beyoncé starts belting out the first verse. As the chorus is reached, scenes of Beyoncé in a darkened room are shown. Additionally, she places her face delicately against dripping water, gently brushing it with her lips and palms. The scenery changes and Beyoncé {{is back in the}} darkened chamber, where she removes her dress.|$|E
25|$|The blink reflex of {{the human}} eye (aversion response) will prevent eye damage, unless the person {{deliberately}} <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> the beam for an extended period. Output power may be up to 1mW. This class includes only lasers that emit visible light. Some laser pointers are in this category.|$|E
25|$|Scrying {{has been}} practised in many {{cultures}} {{in the belief that}} it can reveal the past, present, or future. Some practitioners assert that visions that come when one <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> the media are from the subconscious or imagination, while others say that they come from gods, spirits, devils, or the psychic mind, depending on the culture and practice. There is neither any systematic body of empirical support for any such views in general however, nor for their respective rival merits; individual preferences in such matters are arbitrary at best.|$|E

25|$|Thus, {{it appears}} that a brief 0.25-second {{exposure}} to a <5nbsp&mW laser such as found in red laser pointers does not {{pose a threat to}} eye health. On the other hand, there is a potential for injury if a person deliberately <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> a beam of a classnbsp&IIIa laser for few seconds or more at close range. Even if injury occurs, most people will fully recover their vision. Further experienced discomforts than these may be psychological rather than physical. With regard to green laser pointers the safe exposure time may be less, and with even higher powered lasers instant permanent damage should be expected. These conclusions must be qualified with recent theoretical observations that certain prescription medications may interact with some wavelengths of laser light, causing increased sensitivity (phototoxicity).|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "She" [...] {{was shot in}} Los Angeles. Ocean posted several behind the scene photos of the video shoot onto his own {{personal}} Tumblr account, including pictures [...] "with a pretty young thing as his leading lady." [...] Ocean plays [...] "double duty as a cop and {{the man of the}} house, almost unrecognizable in a white wig and drab attire. In one of the more chilling images, Tyler <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> the camera as a gun is pointed at his head, wearing the same black contacts he sported in his viral sensation “Yonkers” video." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{a parody of}} The Wonder Years, in which Bart <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> the distance after realizing {{that he has to}} get his first job, and an older version of Bart's voice is heard saying [...] "I didn't realize it at the time, but a little piece of my childhood had slipped away forever." [...] Daniel Stern guest starred as the voice of the adult Bart, just like he did for the adult voice of the character Kevin in the television show The Wonder Years (he had also featured with Yeardley Smith in the movie City Slickers around the time this episode was produced).|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} marks {{a departure}} from conventional and contemporary European epitaphs by placing the saints and mortal donor within the same pictorial space. Van der Paele kneels {{to the right of}} the Virgin and Child and seems a somewhat distracted and absent-minded figure. This is intentional, an indication that he is, in the words of art historian Bret Rothstein, [...] "disconnected from the perceptible world", and fully absorbed in the spiritual realm. This notion is reinforced by his glasses which, although they imply education, wealth and learning, also allude to fallibility of the human, earthly senses. In keeping with the conventions of late medieval art, van der Paele does not look directly at any of the heavenly figures, but <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> the middle distance, observing social and spiritual decorum.|$|E
500|$|He {{heads to}} her house, which is eerily quiet. Going in, he discovers {{a bottle of}} whiskey, several {{cigarette}} butts, and a telegram from the government. Dorothy's husband is dead, his plane shot down over France. Dorothy comes out of her bedroom, crying, and Hermie tells her [...] "I'm sorry." [...] The sense of empathy triggers her to channel to Hermie some of her loneliness. She turns on the record player and invites Hermie to dance with her. They kiss and embrace, tears on both their faces. Without speaking, and to the sound only of the waves, they move to the bedroom, where she draws him into bed and gently makes love with him. Afterward, withdrawing again into her world of hurt, Dorothy retires to the porch, leaving Hermie alone in her bedroom. He approaches her on the porch, where she can only quietly say [...] "Good night, Hermie." [...] He leaves, his last image of Dorothy being of her leaning against the railing, as she smokes a cigarette and <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> the night sky.|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the video is {{dedicated}} to the Broadway musical Cabaret. The video begins with soldiers in black leather uniforms in a cabaret with a close-up of a soldier passed out in female fishnet stockings and heels as another lone soldier <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> the distance. The scene then cuts to male dancers performing elaborate choreography while marching forward with a Star of David. As the intro of the song begins, Gaga is shown leading a funeral procession, carrying the Sacred Heart on a pillow. When the lyrics begin, she sits on a throne wearing an elaborate headpiece and binocular-like eyepieces, with a smoking pipe in her hand, watching her dancers perform a rigorous routine in the snow. Gaga is then seen as the character Sally Bowles from Cabaret, dancing and simulating sex acts with three men on a stage with twin beds surrounded by spotlights, all wearing nothing but underwear, intercut with shots of Gaga lying on a larger bed dressed in a red latex nun outfit. She subsequently appears dressed in a white hooded robe, reminiscent of Joan of Arc, with her dancers, interspersed with a shot of her as the nun, consuming a set of rosary beads. After this, Gaga and her dancers are shown in a sequence in black-and-white in their military uniforms performing a tribute dedicated to the late choreographer Bob Fosse, who won an Academy Award for his direction of the film version of Cabaret. Gaga is seen in a blonde bob and a similar outfit to one of Liza Minnelli's performance costumes. The video moves to a scene of her wearing a bra equipped with AR-15 rifle barrels [...] and her dancers performing another dance routine. She is then shown in the empty club, scenes of war breaking out flash by, and the lone soldier appears again. Going back to the Joan of Arc scene, she struggles with her dancers and disrobes. The video ends with her dressed as the nun, the film burning away from her face outwards. Klein explained that the video was, [...] "about a woman's desire to resurrect a dead love and who can not face the brutality of her present situation. The pain of living without your true love." ...|$|E

2500|$|Davis {{showed little}} {{interest}} in the film Now, Voyager (1942) until Hal Wallis advised her that female audiences needed romantic dramas to distract them from the reality of their lives. It became one of the best known of her [...] "women's pictures". In one of the film's most imitated scenes, Paul Henreid lights two cigarettes as he <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> Davis' eyes and passes one to her. Film reviewers complimented Davis on her performance, the National Board of Review commenting that she gave the film [...] "a dignity not fully warranted by the script." ...|$|E

As the squad converges, the sniper begs for death, prompting an argument about whether or not to kill her. Animal Mother decides to allow a mercy killing only if Joker performs it. After some hesitation, Joker shoots her. The Marines congratulate him on his kill as Joker <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> the distance, displaying the thousand-yard stare. The Marines march toward their camp, singing the [...] "Mickey Mouse March". Joker states that despite being [...] "in a world of shit", he is glad to be alive and no longer afraid.|$|E
2500|$|In this legend, {{which dates}} back to 1970, a police (or customs) officer pulls over a driver {{believed}} to have been drinking, sees that the driver has a water bottle, and demands a taste of it to see if it contains alcohol. [...] The officer does not taste any alcohol, so the driver either gets off completely or merely gets a speeding ticket. Shortly afterward, the officer begins tripping very hard and <b>stares</b> <b>into</b> space, since the swig of [...] "water" [...] he took actually contained numerous [...] "hits" [...] of LSD. [...] In some versions of the legend, the officer consumes enough LSD to actually go insane. [...] According to Snopes.com, there are no verifiable reports of this ever happening, even decades after the legend was first told, and it is thus considered spurious. However, there have been recent accounts of officers dosed while on the job.|$|E
