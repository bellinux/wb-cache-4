5000|$|A high-tensile chain, also {{referred}} to as a transport chain, is a link chain with a high tensile strength used for drawing or securing loads. This type of chain usually consist of broad (thick/heavy) metal, oblong torus-shaped links for high strength. All the links of the chain are usually identical, and on the ends are usually two hooks of the appropriate size and strength to slide easily over one chain link but small enough not let the links slip by. When the ability to grasp the load is required, a <b>slip</b> <b>hook</b> is used.|$|E
60|$|Manuel nudged Dan, who darted to the after-tackle, and, leaning far overside, <b>slipped</b> the <b>hook</b> {{into the}} stern-rope as Manuel made her fast forward. The others pulled gallantly and swung the boat in--man, fish, and all.|$|R

50|$|Drwal faced Rousimar Palhares on March 27, 2010 at UFC 111, losing {{after an}} early <b>slip</b> via heel <b>hook</b> {{submission}} {{which appeared to}} injure Drwal. Palhares was subsequently suspended for 90 days for continuing to apply pressure to the lock after the referee intervened.|$|R
60|$|The {{room door}} <b>slipped</b> off its <b>hook</b> and swung wide open as the vessel rolled, and Dick, {{who could not}} {{withdraw}} unnoticed, decided to light his cigarette in order that the others might {{see that they were}} not alone. As he struck the match the captain got up.|$|R
40|$|Mechanism makes rack {{hardware}} interchangeable, {{regardless of}} drawer height. Provides quick connection and disconnection of equipment drawer. Pivoting lever is heart of mechanism. At insertion, lever rotated slightly counterclockwise so bottom <b>hook</b> <b>slips</b> over pin; then rotated clockwise to engage pin and lever lock. Rotation of lever to full counterclockwise position disengages panel from rack...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{must come}} myself, I suppose!' said Stalo, putting aside the box. But, meanwhile, Patto had <b>slipped</b> from the <b>hook</b> and {{concealed}} himself behind the door, so that, as Stalo stepped in, his prisoner raised the axe, {{and with one}} blow the ogre's head was rolling on the ground. His sons were so frightened at the sight that they all ran away.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} famous games was played in the mid-1950s in Arthur. A packed house became embroiled in brawl which spilled out onto the ice. Fans leaned against the boards when defenceman Ken Elliott became {{involved}} in a fight. The boards <b>slipped</b> off their <b>hooks,</b> and the fans spilled onto the ice, resulting in the melee. Mt. Forest eventually managed to retreat to their dressing room. Police assisted in helping the visitors leave the arena.|$|R
5000|$|Better quality tent pegs {{will have}} {{symmetrical}} tips, either conical or [...] "V" [...] shaped, {{to ensure that}} they can be driven into the ground without veering off alignment. They will also typically have hook extensions to allow the end of the hook to be also driven into the ground, providing a second ground contact point, to reduce the risk that the peg may turn in the ground under tension and allow the rope it is holding to <b>slip</b> off the <b>hook.</b>|$|R

25|$|On 20 August 1929, off {{the coast}} of New Jersey, a biplane hooked itself to the bottom of a {{dirigible}} and was carried along by the larger craft. This is the 2nd such incident. The “snapon, snapoff” experiment is accomplished by the Navy airship , under Lt. Com. Herbert Wiley, and a Navy biplane. The biplane, regulating its speed to that of the dirigible, flew close under the Los Angeles. A large hook had been attached {{to the middle of the}} top wing of the biplane, and from the bottom of the Los Angeles hung a U-shaped yoke. Maneuvering the ship under the dirigible, the plane pilot <b>slipped</b> the <b>hook</b> into the Los Angeles’ yoke and for 3 or 4 minutes the dirigible carried the biplane. The plane pilot, by a cord arrangement in his cabin, withdrew the hook from the yoke and flew clear of the dirigible.|$|R
50|$|Other {{styles of}} tent pegs have fully formed eyes {{through which the}} rope is passed so that the rope cannot come off the peg no matter in which {{direction}} the peg is oriented. The Delta (or dog-leg) shape peg always points toward the tent and can never turn. The guy is partially buried and cannot <b>slip</b> off the <b>hook.</b> Delta shaped pegs lie level with the soil offering maximum safety. The rope pulls against the ground rather than levering a straight peg at one end. Metal delta pegs can be springy, absorbing wind shocks.|$|R
50|$|The three King Kites, Hjordis and the Falcon III {{were all}} shipped to Wasserkuppe {{in time for}} the 1937 {{international}} competition. The first launch for the British team ended in disaster when Willy Watt, in a King Kite, on his first ever bungee launch attempted to turn immediately after the bungee <b>slipped</b> off the <b>hook,</b> the King Kite spun into the ground disintegrating around the dazed Watt. John Nielan also had an episode with spinning, recovering at very low altitude and then continuing on a cross-country competition task. The reason for the King Kites handling problems was attributed to the inner wing being jigged improperly in the factory, so rectification on the three already built King Kites was impossible.|$|R
50|$|Boyle {{suffered}} a major setback, however, in September 2007, injuring {{himself in a}} freak accident after a pre-season game when a skate <b>slipped</b> off a <b>hook</b> in his locker and hit him in the left wrist, severing three tendons. Boyle underwent initial wrist surgery on September 23; he attempted to return on October 29, but after playing his first four games of the 2007-08 season, Boyle underwent additional surgery on the injured wrist, missing another 36 games. He did not make a full comeback until January 24, 2008, scoring two goals in his return, and soon thereafter was re-signed to a six-year, $40 million contract extension on February 25. He completed his injury-shortened campaign with 25 points in 37 games.|$|R
5000|$|A bureaucratic mix-up {{results in}} Hermes {{receiving}} a [...] "mandatory fishing license" [...] {{instead of a}} pet license for Nibbler. The crew takes the Planet Express Ship {{to the center of}} the Atlantic Ocean, and starts fishing. After failing to catch anything, a bored Bender fashions a large fish hook and attaches it to the ship's unbreakable diamond filament tether. Sunset comes, and the crew is ready to head back to New New York. Bender begins to haul in his line, but he has caught a colossal-mouth bass. The bass dives, dragging the ship to the bottom of the ocean before the <b>hook</b> <b>slips</b> loose. The Planet Express Ship survives its trek to the bottom, but its engines will not work underwater.|$|R
5000|$|Later on, Rough Cut and {{two other}} men go to a strip club. As a woman dances and strips, he gives her a small chunk of diamond. Catwoman enters the strip club and covers for the other {{stripper}} women, but this only proves {{to be a way}} for her to confront Rough Cut. As every single person has already fled the strip club, Catwoman and Rough Cut are left alone. After a short fight, he escapes before she can get him. Some while later, Catwoman attacks Rough Cut whilst he is driving a craned truck. Catwoman <b>slips</b> the crane <b>hook</b> under the truck and escapes before it crashes, the hook flying over and slicing a ship full of goods in half. The truck overturns and Rough Cut is killed.|$|R
60|$|One of Mr Ravenshaw's largest pigs {{had been}} swept {{out of the}} {{outhouse}} lofts. Struggling with the stream, he passed under {{the window of the}} storeroom, and came across the line of Peegwish with his tail. Every one must be familiar with the tendency of tails in general to shut down when touched. The unfortunate pig obeyed the natural law, and the line continued to <b>slip</b> until the <b>hook</b> was reached, when, of course, the natural result followed. There could be no hope of escape, for the tail was remarkably tough and the line strong. Peegwish held on stoutly. Wildcat lent her aid. The jerking on the tail depressed the snout of the pig, whose shrieks, being thus varied by intermittent gurgles, rendered the noise more appalling, and quickly drew the whole household to the windows.|$|R
40|$|With the {{observations}} of the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we present the slipping magnetic reconnections with multiple flare ribbons (FRs) during an X 1. 2 eruptive flare on 2014 January 7. A center negative polarity was surrounded by several positive ones, and there appeared three FRs. The three FRs showed apparent <b>slipping</b> motions, and <b>hook</b> structures formed at their ends. Due to the moving footpoints of the erupting structures, one tight semi-circular hook disappeared after the slippage along its inner and outer edge, and coronal dimmings formed within the hook. The east hook also faded {{as a result of}} the magnetic reconnection between the arcades of a remote filament and a hot loop that was impulsively heated by the under flare loops. Our results are accordant with the slipping magnetic reconnection regime in 3 D standard model for eruptive flares. We suggest that complex structures of the flare is likely a consequence of the more complex flux distribution in the photosphere, and the eruption involves at least two magnetic reconnections...|$|R
60|$|He {{drew out}} of his breast pocket a new pigskin pocket-book. Mrs Verloc {{received}} it without another word, and stood still till the bell, clattering after Mr Verloc and Mr Verloc’s visitor, had quieted down. Only then she peeped in at the amount, drawing the notes out for the purpose. After this inspection she looked round thoughtfully, {{with an air of}} mistrust in the silence and solitude of the house. This abode of her married life appeared to her as lonely and unsafe {{as though it had been}} situated in the midst of a forest. No receptacle she could think of amongst the solid, heavy furniture seemed other but flimsy and particularly tempting to her conception of a house-breaker. It was an ideal conception, endowed with sublime faculties and a miraculous insight. The till was not to be thought of. It was the first spot a thief would make for. Mrs Verloc unfastening hastily a couple of <b>hooks,</b> <b>slipped</b> the pocket-book under the bodice of her dress. Having thus disposed of her husband’s capital, she was rather glad to hear the clatter of the door bell, announcing an arrival. Assuming the fixed, unabashed stare and the stony expression reserved for the casual customer, she walked in behind the counter.|$|R
5000|$|On August 9 Great Eastern put to sea again, {{in order}} to grapple the lost cable of 1865, and {{complete}} it to Newfoundland. [...] They were determined to find it. There were some who thought it hopeless to try, declaring that to locate a cable two-and-a-half miles down would be like looking for a small needle in a large haystack. Robert Halpin navigated the ship to the correct location. [...] For days, Great Eastern moved slowly here and there, [...] "fishing" [...] for the lost cable with a grappling hook {{at the end of}} a stout rope. Suddenly, the cable was [...] "caught" [...] and brought to the surface, but while the men cheered it <b>slipped</b> from the <b>hook</b> and vanished again. It was not until a fortnight later that it was once more fished up; it took 26 hours to get it safely on board Great Eastern again. The cable was carried to the electrician's room, where it was determined that the cable was connected. All on the ship cheered or wept as rockets were sent up into the sky to light the sea. The recovered cable was then spliced to a fresh cable in her hold, and paid out to Heart's Content, Newfoundland, where she arrived on Saturday, September 7. There were now two working telegraph lines.|$|R
5000|$|A chase ensues {{in which}} Cora, Quito, Sgt. Hook, and Fred, in the wagon, attempt to outdistance Nanchez {{and his men}} on horseback. Sgt. Hook drives the wagon, and Fred rides {{in the back with}} his rifle, {{shooting}} at Nanchez and his braves, who in turn shoot arrows at their fleeing quarry. Fighting for his son, Nanchez is shot and killed by Fred, who is fighting to hold on to Cora. Simultaneously, Fred is killed by an Apache arrow. Seeing Nanchez fall, the Apache warriors abandon the pursuit and depart. [...] Quito stoically accepts his father’s death, an observation that Sgt. Hook makes as a positive “Indian trait” of taking whatever happens in stride. As they drive away, Sgt. Hook suggests to Cora that his enlistment is up in 4 months’ time and that she and Quito can wait for him at the settlement next to the fort, if she will have him. Cora asks about his wife and children. Sgt. Hook admits to Cora that he made them up as a shield against wives at posts who relentlessly try to fix up bachelors. Cora exclaims that she always suspected the wife and daughters were fictitious. Quito makes a remark in Apache dialect. Sgt. Hook looks affectionately at Quito and says he now needs to learn English, as he hands a delighted Quito the reins and lets the young boy pretend to drive. Sgt. <b>Hook</b> <b>slips</b> an arm around Cora. Having formed a family with a bright future, they ride off contentedly into the sunset.|$|R
5000|$|A {{latch hook}} {{is both the}} tool and the textile art of latch hooking. Latch hooking differs from {{traditional}} rug hooking and locker hooking by the physical knotting of the yarn to canvas. Latch hook was invented {{in the nineteenth century}} with the latch needle, in the twentieth century the latch needle underwent numerous variations including the hand tool used by artisans and crafters to produce latch hook rugs. While rug hooking uses a base fabric of burlap or hessian, latch hooking uses specially woven rug canvas. Rug canvases range from 3.3 holes per inch (hpi) to 5 hpi. The pattern may be stencilled onto the canvas or worked from a chart similar to a needlepoint pattern. Latch hook yarns may be bough pre-cut (usually 2.5 inch lengths) or in skeins and cut to the desired length.In his book [...] "The Hooked Rug," [...] published in 1930, American writer William Winthrop Kent describes a form of rugmaking [...] "A canvas is used like cross-stitch canvas only coarser, which has every third mesh a large one. It is held on the knee or on a table. The pieces of wool yarn are cut exactly the same length by a gauge. The hook used has a catch or latch on it and is inserted in one hole and out the next in the next row, as follows: The wool is held in the left hand and above the canvas, then doubled and the double end is <b>slipped</b> over the <b>hook,</b> the catch being up or open. The hook is then drawn out through the canvas toward the worker, the cut ends being kept in the left hand. The catch by this action drops down and secures the wool. The tool is next pushed forward through the wool loop and catches the two ends held in the left hand, then the loop is held in the left hand and has the two ends pulled through it with the hook. To pull out hook and draw tight the two cut ends finishes the knot. This is really a pile fabric and is known as a Turkey Rug but sprang from the hooking process as the earlier hook used was of the crochet hook form." ...|$|R
25|$|Fred Trueman (0/59) gave Bobby Simpson and Bill Lawry a torrid time, {{his first}} ball to Simpson rolled onto the stumps, {{but failed to}} {{dislodge}} the bail and they survived the day with 16/0. They moved along to 104 by lunch, but not without a few scares. Brian Statham missed a simple caught and bowled off Simpson and Trueman's strong left arm nearly had Lawry run out while backing up. Simpson had made 109, 66 not out, 28, 122, 130, 9, 110 and 50 {{so far in the}} season and looked tired when he edged Ted Dexter (2/78) behind to the vigilant England wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 71 in a stand of 136. Norm O'Neill came in and promptly drove Dexter for 4, then hooked him for another. He took a boundary off Barry Knight and even Lawry joined in the act, hooking Statham to the boundary as they added 80 runs in 79 minutes. Knight was reduced to bowling down the leg-side without a <b>slip</b> and O'Neill <b>hooked</b> to the boundary and smashed him over mid-on, which even brought applause from Dexter. Lawry moved smoothly to 98 then hooked a long hop from Fred Titmus (1/81) into the hands of David Sheppard in the deep. Neil Harvey came out to attack the bowling - he rarely did anything else - and the runs flowed regardless of Dexter's attempts to plug the gaps. O'Neill was out to a beautiful ball from Statham (1/67) that cut back and had him lbw for 56 with 9 fours and Harvey's 57 with 6 fours ended when he tried to hit Dexter out of the ground and was caught by Statham at deep mid-off. Peter Burge (47 not out) had kept Harvey company in a stand of 84, and added 37 runs with Brian Booth (19 not out) in the last half hour and Australia were 362/4, 377 runs ahead {{by the end of the}} fourth day. Benaud's decision to not declare and have a bowl that evening was criticised by the press and several theories were advanced as to why. Some thought he was playing mind-games with the English batsmen, giving them an uncertain and nervous night, others that he was afraid of Dexter's batting power. A more likely explanation was that Benaud had suffered a groin strain after his 42 over marathon in the first innings and he didn't want to declare until he knew he would be fit on the last day. In any case after inspecting the wicket with Neil Harvey and bowling a few balls in front of the pavilion he declared ten minutes before play started. England were given 378 runs to win, a total that they have yet to make in a fourth innings against Australia.|$|R
50|$|The pitch {{itself had}} become slower and slower. Some {{observers}} {{said that it}} was useless to bowlers and batsmen alike.
