40|$|One of the {{important}} bottlenecks to the wider adoption of planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> {{is a lack of}} evidence about whether they improve planning processes. In addition, existing research does not include field studies with high context validity. This paper fills this gap in the literature by reporting the results from a field study evaluating the performance of a planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> used for sketch planning as part of a land use planning project in metropolitan Austin, Texas, USA. Participants reported high levels of learning and dialog quality, the two chosen planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> performance measures. A regression analysis finds both are related to the ability of planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> to change participantsâ€™ perceptions. In addition, as suggested by learning theory, the planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> performance outcomes are significantly related to participantsâ€™ identity as a planner and meeting attendance, but are not related to gender or educational attainment. Finally, for the planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> studied here, participation in the planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> creation is less important than other factors in explaining planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> performance.

Traditionally, such selection is {{on the basis of the}} experience of the design engineer. Nevertheless, the validity of such selection is questionable. A new approach for selecting the optimum tunnel <b>support</b> <b>system</b> based on Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is proposed. In this new approach, {{the selection of}} the tunnel <b>support</b> <b>system</b> is considered as a multi criteria decision-making problem. Firstly, by using the numerical Finite Difference Method (FDM), based on technical and stability parameters of the tunnel, different <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> are specified. Then, by considering the economics and performance indices of each <b>support</b> <b>system,</b> a decision tree based on AHP model is generated and the optimum <b>support</b> <b>system</b> is selected.
