40|$|We {{describe}} Utile Coordination, an algorithm {{that allows}} a multiagent system to learn where and how to coordinate. The method starts with uncoordinated learners and maintains <b>statistics</b> <b>on</b> expected <b>returns.</b> Coordination dependencies are dynamically added if the statistics indicate a statistically significant benefit. This results in a compact state representation because only necessary coordination is modeled. We apply our method {{within the framework of}} coordination graphs in which value rules represent the coordination dependencies between the agents for a specific context. The algorithm is first applied on a small illustrative problem, and next on a large predator-prey problem in which two predators have to capture a single prey...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{investigating}} {{the possibility of}} mean reversion in stock prices with <b>statistics</b> based <b>on</b> multiyear <b>returns</b> have noted difficulties in drawing inferences from these statistics because the approximating asymptotic distributions perform poorly. We develop an alternative asymptotic distribution theory for statistics involving multiyear returns. These distributions diPier markedly from those implied by the conventional theory. The alternative theory provides substantially better approximations to the relevant finite-sample distributions. It also leads to empirical inferences much less {{at odds with the}} hypothesis of no mean reversion...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{empirical}} power and specification of test statistics in event studies designed to detect long-run (one- to five-year) abnormal stock returns. We document that test <b>statistics</b> based <b>on</b> abnormal <b>returns</b> calculated using a reference portfolio, {{such as a}} market index, are misspecified (empirical rejection rates exceed theoretical rejection rates) and identify three reasons for this misspecification. We correct for the three identified sources of misspecification by matching sample firms to control firms of similar sizes and book-to-market ratios. This control firm approach yields well-specified test statistics in virtually all sampling situations considered...|$|R

The results of drug testsfor marijuana, cocaine, phencyclidine (PCP), opiates, and amphetaminesare compared {{with the results of}} alcohol tests for the various types of required tests. Statistics are presented for random, post-accident, reasonable suspicion, and pre- employment tests combined and for each individual test type. Those test results are further compared by employer type (transit agencies and contractors), employer size (large, small, and rural), employee category, FTA region, and the drug type. This is the sixth annual report {{of the results of the}} Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) Drug and Alcohol Testing Program. The report summarizes the new reporting requirements introduced for calendar year 2001, the requirements of the overall drug and alcohol testing program (the revised CFR Part 40 and CFR Part 655), the results from the data reported for 2001, and the violation and positive rates for calendar years 1996 through 2001. <b>Statistics</b> <b>on</b> employees <b>returned</b> to duty and results of return-to-duty tests and follow-up tests are presented separately from results of the other four test types because return-to-duty tests and follow-up tests represent a different segment of the test population and not all employers offer rehabilitation.

50|$|The {{organization}} of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture had begun following the Governor's signing of its Act of Legislation on April 21, 1852, {{around the same time}} that Flint was finishing his studies in law. Led by the Hon. Marshall P. Wilder, a merchant and advocate of agricultural education {{for more than a decade}} prior, the goal was to create a permanent government body that would accurately gather <b>statistics</b> <b>on</b> the crop <b>returns</b> of the county agricultural societies as well as provide a forum for the advancement of the state's agriculture. This Board was to be a representative body reporting to the state's senate and house, connected with to executive government with the Governor, Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of the Commonwealth serving as members ex officiis. The governor and this executive council would then appoint 3 members considered of scientific background, with the remaining membership being elected delegates from each county agricultural society, serving in terms of 3 years each.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} environmental management practices on the financial performance of a South African mining firm. The major aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate whether such practices have a close relationship with the mining firm’s financial performance (represented by <b>return</b> <b>on</b> equity [ROE]). The approach is a case study of a South African mining firm listed under the socially responsible index (SRI) of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). It uses Green-Steel sa (pseudonym used in place of the real name) as a case study. Using multiple regression <b>statistics,</b> the <b>return</b> <b>on</b> equity of Green-Steel sa is regressed on three environmental management practices of Green- Steel (carbon reduction, energy efficiency, and water usage). The result shows there is no significant relationship between the variables and this lends credence to information gathered from Green-Steel environmental reports that Green-Steel’s environmental management practices are driven mostly by a desire to abide by regulations and also by a moral obligation to use environmental management practices to mitigate climate change impact...|$|R
