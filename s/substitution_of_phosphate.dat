40|$|One of {{functional}} {{properties of the}} meat is decrease of water holding capacity (WHC) during rigor mortis. At the time of pre-rigor, WHC is higher than post-rigor. The decline of WHC has implication to the other functional properties such as decreased cooking lost and yields resulting in lower elasticity and compactness of processed meat product. In many cases, the addition of phosphate in the meat will increase the functional properties of the meat such as WHC. Furthermore, liquid smoke has also been known in increasing the WHC of fresh meat. For food safety reasons, liquid smoke {{in the present study}} was used as a substitute to phosphate in production of chicken nuggets. This study aimed to know the effect of <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>phosphate</b> with liquid smoke on the quality of nuggets made from post-rigor chicken thigh and breast. The study was arranged using completely randomized design of factorial pattern 2 x 3 with three replications. Factor 1 was thigh and breast parts of the chicken, and factor 2 was different levels of liquid smoke in substitution to phosphate (0 %, 50 %, and 100 %). The thigh and breast post-rigor broiler aged 40 days were used as the main raw materials in making nuggets. Auxiliary materials instead of meat were phosphate, liquid smoke at concentration of 10 %, tapioca flour, salt, eggs and ice. Variables measured were flexibility, shear force value, cooking loss, elasticity level, and preferences. The results of this study showed that the <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>phosphate</b> with 100 % liquid smoke resulting high quality nuggets. Likewise, the breast part of the meat showed higher quality nuggets than thigh part. This is indicated by high elasticity, low shear force value, low cooking loss, and a high level of preference of the nuggets.

X-ray fluorescence, microprobe, and bulk chemical analyses indicate high variabilities in cations and anions and generally low oxide totals. This is probably related to the <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>phosphate</b> and fluoride aniors by hydroxide and carbonate anions in phosphates and to the depletion of iron, aluminum, and potassium cations and the enrichment in hydroxide and crystal water in glauconites. Gradients in pore-water contents of dissolved phosphate and fluoride at Sites 798 and 799 suggest a depth of phosphate precipitation between 30 and 50 mbsf, with fluoride as the limiting element for phosphate precipitation at Site 798. Phosphate and fluoride appear to be balanced at Site 799. Crude extrapolations indicate that the Japan-Sea sediments may have taken up approximately 7. 2 * 10 ** 10 g P total/yr during the Neogene and Pleistocene. This amount corresponds to approximately 0. 3 % of the estimated present-day global transfer of phosphorus into the sediments and suggests that the Japan Sea constitutes an average sink for this element.

40|$|AbstractThe {{properties}} {{of a new}} class of phospholipids, alkyl phosphocholine triesters, are described. These compounds were prepared from phosphatidylcholines through <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>phosphate</b> oxygen by reaction with alkyl trifluoromethylsulfonates. Their unusual behavior is ascribed to their net positive charge and absence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The O-ethyl, unsaturated derivatives hydrated to generate large, unilamellar liposomes. The phase transition temperature of the saturated derivatives is very {{similar to that of the}} precursor phosphatidylcholine and quite insensitive to ionic strength. The dissociation of single molecules from bilayers is unusually facile, as revealed by the surface activity of aqueous liposome dispersions. Vesicles of cationic phospholipids fused with vesicles of anionic lipids. Liquid crystalline cationic phospholipids such as 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -ethylphosphocholine triflate formed normal lipid bilayers in aqueous phases that interacted with short, linear DNA and supercoiled plasmid DNA to form a sandwich-structured complex in which bilayers were separated by strands of DNA. DNA in a 1 : 1 (mol) complex with cationic lipid was shielded from the aqueous phase, but was released by neutralizing the cationic charge with anionic lipid. DNA-lipid complexes transfected DNA into cells very effectively. Transfection efficiency depended upon the form of the lipid dispersion used to generate DNA-lipid complexes; in the case of the O-ethyl derivative described here, large vesicle preparations in the liquid crystalline phase were most effective...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to verify {{the effect of the}} <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>phosphate</b> by its related compound phosphite on the in vitro growth of sweet potato nodal segments. Segments from a previous culture were incubated in MS media with the following combinations of phosphate:phosphite: Control (100 / 0 %); T 1 (87. 5 / 12. 5 %); T 2 (75 / 25 %); T 3 (50 / 50 %) and T 4 (0 / 100 %) in a 5 x 5 factorial arrangement, with five treatments (Control, T 1, T 2, T 3 and T 4) and five evaluation periods (7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days). The design was completely random, with three replicates of two explants per period. The evaluations were made weekly by counting the number of shoots and the length and dry weight of shoots and roots. Increasing the phosphite concentration decreased all attributes measured, including growth velocity, length and dry weight. These results indicate that phosphite cannot be used as substituted of phosphate in sweet potato tissue cultures. O objetivo deste trabalho foi verificar o efeito da substituição do fosfato pelo composto derivado fosfito no crescimento in vitro de segmentos nodais de batata doce. Os segmentos obtidos de culturas prévias foram incubados em meio MS com as seguintes combinações de fosfato/fosfito: Controle (100 / 0 %); T 1 (87. 5 / 12. 5 %); T 2 (75 / 25 %); T 3 (50 / 50 %) e T 4 (0 / 100 %) respectivamente, em arranjo fatorial de 5 x 5, com cinco tratamentos (Controle, T 1, T 2, T 3 e T 4) e cinco períodos de avaliação (7, 14, 21, 28 e 35 dias). O desenho experimental foi completamente casualizado com três repetições com dois explantes por período. As avaliações foram feitas semanalmente por contagem do número de brotos, comprimento e peso seco de parte aérea de brotos e raízes. O aumento da dose de fosfito diminuiu todos os atributos analisados, como velocidade de crescimento, comprimento e peso seco, significando que o fosfito não pode ser utilizado em substituição ao fosfato na cultura de tecidos de batata doce...|$|E

As dietas experimentais, à base de milho e farelo de soja e P suplementado com a substituição de 33, 33 %, 66, 67 % e 100 % do fosfato bicálcico (FBC) pelo monobicálcico (MBC), foram formuladas com base nos valores de fósforo total, ou seja, isofosfóricas (0, 56 % e 0, 42 % nas fases de crescimento e terminação, respectivamente). Os níveis de substituição do FBC pelo MBC não influenciaram o desempenho, os pesos absoluto e relativo dos rins e do fígado, o rendimento de carcaça e os parâmetros sangüíneos dos suínos. Entretanto, observou-se diminuição linear nos teores de cinza, de fósforo e de cálcio dos ossos e aumento linear na espessura da camada compacta e na relação camada compacta/periósteo dos ossos com a substituição do FBC pelo MBC. A substituição total e/ou parcial do fosfato bicálcico pelo monobicálcico não influenciou o desempenho dos suínos nas fases de crescimento e terminação. Fifty-six pigs (average {{initial weight}} of 28. 47 kg) {{were assigned to}} a randomized blocks design, in a factorial scheme 4 x 2 (levels of dicalcium phosphate substitution x sex) with four repplicates for males and three for females, with two animals per experimental unit, to evaluate the effects of replacement levels of phosphate dicalcium by phosphate monodicalcium on the performance, blood and bone parameters of swine fed during the growing (30 to 60 kg) and finishing (60 to 90 kg) phases. Corn and soybean meal based -diets with phosphorus supplemented with replacement levels of 33. 33, 66. 67 and 100 % of phosphate dicalcium (FBC) by monodicalcium (MBC) were formulated based on the values of total phosphorus, i. e., isophosphoric (0. 56 and 0. 42 % in the growth and finishing phases, respectively). The levels of substitution of FBC for MBC did not influence the performance, absolute and relative weight of the kidneys and liver, carcass yield and blood parameters. However, a linear decrease was observed in the ash, phosphorus and calcium contents of the bones and a lineal increase in {{the thickness of the}} compact layer and in the layer compact/periosteal relationship of the bones with the substitution of FBC by MBC.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that phage lambda site-specific recombination proceeds via two independent strand exchanges: the first exchange forming a Holliday-structure which is then converted into complete recombinant products by the second strand exchange. If this hypothesis is correct, one {{should be able to}} trap the putative Holliday intermediate by preventing the second strand exchange. In this paper, we show that <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> phosphorothioate for <b>phosphate</b> in one strand of a recombination site is an effective way to block recombination while permitting the accumulation of a novel structure. This effect is seen only when phosphorothioate is positioned at a point of potential cleavage by Int recombinase, demonstrating that the inhibition of strand exchange is highly specific. Analysis of the novel structure that accumulates in these reactions proves that it contains a Holliday joint. Holliday-structures can also be detected in unblocked recombinations but are present at very low levels. The characteristics of Holliday-structure formation that we describe substantiate the proposed recombination pathway...|$|R

Mimetite is characterised by a band at 812 - 3 cm- 1 attributed to the Ag mode. For the arsenian pyromorphite this band is observed at 818 cm- 1 and for hedyphane at 819 cm- 1.

Raman spectroscopy clearly identifies bands attributable to isomorphous <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> arsenate by <b>phosphate.</b> The observation <b>of</b> low intensity bands in the 3200 to 3550 cm- 1 region are assigned to adsorbed water and OH units, thus indicating some replacement of chloride ions with hydroxyl ions...|$|R
40|$|These studies {{examine the}} effects of acute changes in the {{availability}} <b>of</b> inorganic <b>phosphate</b> on the function of isolated proximal renal tubules from rabbit kidney. We removed phosphate from the extracellular fluids and measured fluid absorption rates in isolated perfused tubules and oxygen consumption rates in suspensions of cortical tubules. In proximal convoluted tubules, the selective removal <b>of</b> <b>phosphate</b> from the luminal fluid reduced fluid absorption rates from 1. 11 ± 0. 12 to − 0. 01 ± 0. 08 nl/mm · min. This effect on fluid absorption was dependent on the presence of glucose transport and metabolism. The addition of phlorizin to the phosphate-free luminal fluid preserved fluid absorption rates (1. 12 ± 0. 12 nl/mm · min) as did the <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> nonmetabolized α-methyl d-glucopyranoside for glucose (1. 05 ± 0. 21 nl/mm · min) or the addition of 2 -deoxyglucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis, to the bathing medium (1. 01 ± 0. 15 nl/mm · min). There was no effect on fluid absorption if phosphate was removed from the bath only. Additionally, removal <b>of</b> <b>phosphate</b> from the luminal fluid of proximal straight rather than convoluted tubules had no effect on fluid absorption rates.

40|$|Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) {{are major}} {{components}} of the cell surface of Gram-negative bacteria. LPSs comprise a hydrophilic heteropolysaccharide (formed by the core oligosaccharide and the O-specific polysaccharide) that is covalently linked to the glycolipid moiety lipid A, which anchors these macromolecules to the external membrane. LPSs are {{one of a group}} of molecules called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are indispensable for bacterial growth and viability, and act to trigger innate defense responses in eukaryotes. We have previously shown that LPS from the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) can elicit defense responses in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we have extended these studies by analysis of the structure and biological activity of LPS from a nonpathogenic Xcc mutant, strain 8530. We show that this Xcc strain is defective in core completion and introduces significant modification in the lipid A region, which involves the degree of acylation and nonstoichiometric <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>phosphate</b> groups with phosphoethanolamine. Lipid A that was isolated from Xcc strain 8530 did not have the ability to induce the defense-related gene PR 1 in Arabidopsis, or to prevent the hypersensitive response (HR) that is caused by avirulent bacteria as the lipid A from the wild-type could. This suggests that Xcc has the capacity to modify the structure of the lipid A to reduce its activity as a PAMP. We speculate that such effects might occur in wild-type bacteria that are exposed to stresses such as those that might be encountered during plant colonization and disease...|$|R
40|$|High {{temperature}} processing {{is essential}} for the preparation of apatites for biomaterials, lighting, waste removal and other applications. This requires a good understanding of the thermal stability and transitions upon heating. The most widely used is hydroxyapatite (Hap), but increasing interest is being directed to fluorapatite (FAp) and chlorapatite (ClAp). The structural modifications for substitutions are discussed to understand the temperature processing range for the different appetites. This is based on {{a review of the literature}} from the past few decades, together with recent research results. Apatite thermal stability is mainly determined by the stoichiometry (Ca/P ratio and structural substitutions) and the gas composition during heating. Thermal stability is lowered the most by a <b>substitution</b> <b>of</b> calcium and <b>phosphate,</b> leading to loss in phase stability at temperatures less than 900 C. The anions in the hexagonal axis, OH in HAp, F in FAp and Cl in ClAp are the last to leave upon heating, and prevention of the loss of these groups ensures high temperature stability. The information discussed here will assist in understanding the changes of apatites during heating in calcination, sintering, hydrothermal processing, plasma spraying, flame pyrolysis, and other high-temperature processes...|$|R
40|$|Metal ions fold DNA {{junctions}} into {{a compact}} conformation that confers protection of all thymine bases to modification by osmium tetroxide. In {{the absence of}} the cation the arms of the junction are fully extended in an approximately square-planar configuration. Group IIa cations are effective in achieving a folded conformation of the junction at 80 - 100 microM, and there is an excellent agreement between the ionic concentrations that fold the junctions as deduced from gel electrophoretic experiments, and those that prevent osmium tetroxide reaction at the junction. Hexamminecobalt(III) achieves full folding at 2 microM, while spermine and spermidine are effective at 25 microM. Some transition metal ions such as Ni(II) may replace the group IIA cations. Monovalent ions of group IA are only partially effective in folding the junctions. Very much higher concentrations are necessary, gel electrophoretic mobilities suggest that a less symmetrical conformation is adopted and thymine bases at the junction remain reactive to osmium tetroxide. Charge-charge interactions at the centre of the junction are structurally extremely important. <b>Substitution</b> <b>of</b> junction <b>phosphate</b> groups by uncharged methyl phosphonates severely perturbs the structure of the junction. If just two phosphates are substituted, diametrically facing across the junction, the structure always folds in order to place the electrically neutral phosphate on the exchanging strands. We suggest that folding of the junction into the stacked X-structure generates electronegative clefts that can selectively bind metal ions, depending on the chemistry, size and charge of the ion. Moreover, occupation of these cavities is essential for junction folding, in order to reduce electrostatic repulsion. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
