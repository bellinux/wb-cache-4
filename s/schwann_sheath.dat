5000|$|Nerve {{terminals}} are {{the terminal}} {{part of the}} axon filled with neurotransmitters and are the location from which neurotransmitters are released. Nerve terminals may take different forms in different tissues. Nerve terminals appear like a button in the CNS, end plates in striated muscle and varicosities in many tissues including the gut. Buttons, endplates or varicosities all function to store and release neurotransmitters. In many peripheral tissues, the varicose axon branches in its proximal course and carries a covering of <b>Schwann</b> <b>sheath,</b> which is interrupted and finally lost in its most terminal part. The unmyelinated, preterminal axons with very long varicose branches are present in small axon bundles and varicose terminal axons are present as single isolated axons. The small axon bundles run parallel to and between muscle bundles and the “en passage” varicose axons are the main sources of innervations to the gut smooth muscle bundles. [...] Nonsynaptic post-junctional receptors are mostly G-protein coupled metabotropic receptors that produce a slower response. They include metabotropic receptors for the classical neurotransmitters, monoamines, norepinephrine, purines and peptide transmitters. Post-junctional receptors also include some ionotropic receptors such as nicotinic receptors in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) as well as the autonomic nervous system (ANS).|$|E

The tissue distribution of HRF 20 was studied by immunohistochemical analysis using 1 F 5. HRF 20 was predominantly expressed on endothelial cells of systemic arteries, veins and capillaries, {{as well as on the}} surface of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. HRF 20 was also detected, to a lesser extent, on the <b>Schwann</b> <b>sheath</b> of peripheral nerve fibres, ependymal cells and certain epithelial cells such as acinar cells of the salivary gland, bronchial epithelium, renal tubules and squamous epithelium.

40|$|Perifollicular {{nerve endings}} {{of the human}} lanugo hairs have been studied with the {{electron}} microscope. The endorgans are arranged in palisade along {{the periphery of the}} follicle and are composed of an axon and an enveloping <b>Schwann</b> <b>sheath.</b> Spaces between the endorgan are largely free from collagen and cellular elements. This arrangement of endorgans perpendicular to the follicle may be most efficient to detect the movement of the follicle, and the empty spaces between the organs permit a maximum deformation of the terminal axon. The axon produces a subcytomembrane dense layer at the follicular end but is, with rare exceptions, separated from the external root sheath cells by the basal lamina. The endorgan can attach to any portion of the follicle including the cellular junctions, indicating that there is no specialization on the follicular side at the site of attachment. In fact, half-desmosomes and subbasal dense plaques are regularly seen on the basal surface of the follicular basal cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{relationships between}} {{the size of the}} <b>Schwann</b> cell <b>sheath</b> and that of its related axoplasm were studied by electron microscopy in cross sections of bundles of unmyelinated axons (Remak bundles) of the spinal roots of lizard (Lacerta muralis). It was found that (i) the cross sectional area of the <b>Schwann</b> cell <b>sheath</b> is directly proportional to that of its related axoplasm (correlation coefficient 0. 84), and (ii) the ratio between the cross sectional area of the <b>Schwann</b> cell <b>sheath</b> and that of its related axoplasm tends to diminish as the cross sectional area of the latter increases. Thus, under normal conditions, in the bundles of unmyelinated axons of the spinal roots of lizard a quantitative balance exists between the nerve tissue and its associated glial tissue. These results agree with those previously obtained in the myelinated fibres of the same region and in the spinal ganglia of the lizard, gecko, cat and rabbit. Some of the mechanisms probably involved in the control of the quantitative balance between nerve tissue and its associated glial tissue in peripheral nerves are listed...|$|R

40|$|Application {{of black}} widow spider venom to the neuromuscular {{junction}} of the frog causes {{an increase in}} the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials (min. e. p. p.) and a {{reduction in the number of}} synaptic vesicles in the nerve terminal. Shortly after the increase in min. e. p. p. frequency, the presynaptic membrane of the nerve terminal has either infolded or "lifted. " Examination of these infoldings or lifts reveals synaptic vesicles in various stages of fusion with the presynaptic membrane. After the supply of synaptic vesicles has been exhausted, the presynaptic membrane returns to its original position directly opposite the end-plate membrane. The terminal contains all of its usual components with the exception of the synaptic vesicles. The only other alteration of the structures making up the neuromuscular junction occurs in the axon leading to the terminal.

Nonspecific cholinesterase (ChE) is present in relatively low concentrations at the same sites, and in greater concentrations in the teloglial <b>Schwann</b> <b>sheath</b> cells. Significant amounts of reaction product appeared in the junctional cleft only after prolonged incubation with both methods. The identification of AChE and ChE was confirmed by the use of appropriate concentrations of several selective inhibitors. In confirmation of previous studies by light microscopy, the AuThCh method is more specific for AChE and ChE, whereas the AuThAc method allows greater accuracy of localization.

40|$|The Pacinian {{corpuscle}} has {{a framework}} of cytoplasmic lamellae arranged concentrically in the outer zone, and bilaterally in the core. Between these is an intermediate growth zone. The inner core shows an unexpected complexity in that its component lamellae are arranged in two symmetrical groups of nested cytoplasmic sheets. Longitudinal tissue spaces form clefts separating the two groups. The perikarya of the core lamellae lie {{in or near the}} intermediate growth zone, and send arms into the clefts. The arms then branch and terminate as lamellae which interdigitate with those of neighboring cells. The single nerve fiber loses its myelin sheath just before it reaches the inner core but retains its Schwann cell cytoplasmic covering for a short additional distance. The <b>Schwann</b> <b>sheath</b> is not continuous with the lamellae of the inner core. Inside the core the fiber contains a striking circumferential palisade of radially disposed mitochondria. The fiber does not arborize. Vascular capillaries penetrate the hilar region of the corpuscle only as far as the myelinated sheath of the nerve, and they have not been seen elsewhere in the corpuscle. There is direct continuity between the clefts of the core and tissue spaces {{in the vicinity of the}} capillaries. It is likely that this provides a route whereby metabolites reach the active nerve ending, as well as the cells of the growth zone. The outer zone consists of at least 30 flattened concentric cytoplasmic lamellae separated from one another by relatively wide fluid-filled spaces. Collagenous fibrils are present, particularly on the outer surface of lamellae, and tend to be oriented circularly. The girdle of proliferating cells constituting the growth zone, which is prominent in corpuscles from young animals, is the layer from which the outer lamellae are derived. Osmotic forces probably elevate the lamellae, and maintain turgor pressure...|$|E
40|$|As an {{aid in the}} {{interpretation}} of the physiological properties of unmedullated nerve fibers, particularly those having their cells of origin in the dorsal root ganglia, more precise information about their morphology has been acquired through employment of the electron microscope. The appearance of the fibers in the skin nerves is described, with special reference to the structure of their sheaths; and a notation is made about the bearing of the axon-sheath relationship on the biophysical mechanism of conduction (p. 714). There is no basic difference between the sheath systems of the d. r. C and the s. C fibers. Attention is called to a point of similarity between the sheaths of unmyelinated and myelinated axons (p. 715). An assessment was made of the likelihood of interaction between the fibers. In action potentials showing temporal dispersion at several distances, the elevations appeared in their calculated positions. A model of a group of <b>Schwann</b> <b>sheaths</b> was constructed from successive electron microscope sections, showing that the lengths of the sheath branches are short in comparison with the wave lengths of the action potentials. Supported by these and other considerations, the argument is strongly in favor of the conclusion that among d. r. C fibers, as in other fibers, there is no cross-excitation between the axons. A new analysis of the size distribution of the fibers in a sural nerve was made from electron microscope pictures; and from the measurements the action potential was constructed. The result confirmed the view, previously expressed, that the velocities of conduction in the fibers can be precisely accounted for by multiplying the diameters by a constant. In the dorsal roots, the striking change that takes place in the appearance of the fibers and their disposition in the <b>Schwann</b> <b>sheaths</b> can be seen in Fig. 11. The axons partake of the special properties of the peripheral branches, which necessitated the creation of the subdivision of d. r. C fibers. But, their diameters are much smaller. At a set of reduced conduction velocities the configuration of the compound action potential in the nerves is repeated in the roots, with the root velocities still conforming to the size-velocity rule derived from nerve axons...|$|R

40|$|Non-essential {{amino acid}} L-serine {{functions}} as a highly potent, glia-derived neurotrophic factor, {{because it is a}} precursor for syntheses of proteins, other amino acids, membrane lipids, and nucleotides, and also because its biosynthetic enzyme 3 -phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3 PGDH) is preferentially expressed in particular glial cells within the brain. Here we pursued 3 PGDH expression in peripheral nerves and its change after crush injury. In the pathway of rat sciatic nerves, 3 PGDH was selectively expressed in non-neuronal elements: <b>Schwann</b> <b>sheaths</b> and endoneurial fibroblasts in sciatic nerves, satellite cells in dorsal root ganglia, and astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the spinal ventral horn. In contrast, 3 PGDH was immunonegative in axons, somata of spinal motoneurons and ganglion cells, and endoneurial macrophages. One week after crush injury, 3 PGDH was upregulated in the distal segment of injured nerves, where 3 PGDH was intensified in activated Schwann cells and fibroblasts. 3 PGDH was still negative in activated macrophages, which were instead associated or surrounded by activated Schwann cells with intensified 3 PGDH. These results suggest that in the peripheral nervous system, these non-neuronal cells synthesize and may supply L-serine to satisfy metabolic demands for maintenance and regeneration of peripheral nerves and for proliferation and activation of macrophages upon nerve injury...|$|R

Indirect immunofluorescence (IFL) was carried out on rat, mouse and human somatic nerves and rat sympathetic nerves with initial serum dilutions of 1 : 10, and the staining reached a final titre of 1 : 320 in some cases. The antibodies fixed complement and were absorbed out by lyophilized epimastigotes of T. cruzi. Lipid extraction of the tissue sections enhanced the staining of myelinated nerve, whereas unfixed unmyelinated sympathetic nerve was strongly reactive. Central nervous tissue did not display any positive staining on neurons, glial cells or periaxonal sheaths. Furthermore, by using a double-labelled IFL technique, it was possible to show that a rabbit antiserum raised against guinea-pig spinal cord and the chagasic anti-nerve antibodies reacted with different structures in the rat sciatic nerve. These findings suggest that the reactive antigen(s) could be located on Schwann cells. The majority, but not all, of the chagasic individuals with anti-nerve antibodies also showed the sarcolemmal and endothelial staining (EVI) previously described in Chagas' disease. The possible recognition of Schwann cell antigens by circulating antibodies in Chagas' disease could be relevant, since an autonomic denervation has been postulated as a pathogenic mechanism of cardiomyopathy and megaviscera in this condition...|$|R

However, little information is available concerning the functional significance of these caveolae. The present study was undertaken to examine the immunolocalization of caveolin- 1, - 3 (Cav- 1, Cav- 3) and Ca 2 +-ATPase in the periodontal Ruffini endings of the rat incisor. Decalcified sections of the upper jaws were processed for immunocytochemistry at the levels of light and electron microscopy. Some immunostained sections were treated with histochemistry for nonspecific cholinesterase (nChE) activity. Observations showed the periodontal Ruffini endings were immunopositive for Cav- 1, but not Cav- 3. Immunoreactive products for Cav- 1 were confined to caveola-like structures in the cell membranes of the cytoplasmic extensions and cell bodies of the terminal Schwann cells associated with the periodontal Ruffini endings. However, the axonal membranes of the terminals did not express any Cav- 1 immunoreaction. Double staining with Ca 2 +-ATPase and either protein gene product 9. 5 (PGP 9. 5) or S- 100 protein disclosed the co-localization of immunoreactions in the axonal branches of the periodontal Ruffini endings, but not in the terminal Schwann cells.

The two cell types have shown their plasticity in islet injury, but their roles in transplantation remain unclear. In this research, we applied 3 -dimensional neurovascular histology with cell tracing to reveal the participation of Schwann cells and pericytes in mouse islet transplantation. Longitudinal studies of the grafts under the kidney capsule identify that the donor Schwann cells and pericytes re-associate with the engrafted islets at the peri-graft and perivascular domains, respectively, indicating their adaptability in transplantation. Based on the morphological proximity and cellular reactivity, we propose that the new islet microenvironment should include the peri-graft <b>Schwann</b> cell <b>sheath</b> and perivascular pericytes {{as an integral part of}} the new tissue...|$|R

40|$|Cross {{sections}} of olfactory nerves present a unique appearance. They {{indicate the presence}} {{of large numbers of}} very small nerve fibers, with a modal diameter of about 0. 2 µ and a narrow range for their size variation. From one side of the nasal septum of a pig the yield of fibers was estimated at 6, 000, 000; the number arising from the turbinates would be considerably larger. The fibers are attached to the membranes of the <b>Schwann</b> <b>sheaths</b> in large bundles through mesaxons longer and more branched than those that have been seen in other nerves. Continuity of the axons between the nerves and the bipolar cells was traced in an examination of the olfactory mucous membrane; and the indication of a one-to-one relationship between cells and axons was reinforced by a comparative count. After the axons leave the bipolar cells they become incased in the central projections of the sustentacular cells. Where the latter come into contact with the basal cells the axons emerge to push back the plasma membranes of the basal cells in the first step in acquiring their nerve sheaths. Later steps are described. When the axons are delivered by the basal cells to the collecting Schwann tubes, they are already aggregated into small bundles with sheaths fundamentally the same as those they will possess until they are delivered to the glia in the olfactory bulb. Some of the aspects of the cytology of the bipolar cells and adjoining sustentacular cells are described. A survey of the physiological properties of olfactory nerve fibers was made in some experiments on the olfactory nerve of the pike. Almost all of the action potential is encompassed within a single elevation, manifesting at its front a conduction velocity of 0. 2 m. /sec. For a comparison, the last elevation in the C action potential in the sciatic nerve of the frog is cited as an example of conduction at the same velocity. Though expressed through long time constants, the properties of the pike olfactory fibers conform to the generalized schema for properties of vertebrate nerve fibers. This conformity signalizes that they differ from the exceptional properties of the unmedullated fibers of dorsal root origin. An afferent function for unmedullated nerve fibers does not imply that the fibers concerned are alike in their physiological properties...|$|R
5000|$|MAG (Myelin-associated glycoprotein) is {{expressed}} on cells that form myelin <b>sheaths</b> (<b>schwann</b> cells and oligodendrocytes) around neurons. MAG binds to sialylated ligands on the neuron. Knock-out of MAG in the {{peripheral nervous system}} leads to decreased myelination of neurons. Knock-out of MAG in {{the central nervous system}} of mice does not appear to affect myelination, but the interaction between the myelin and the neuron does deteriorate with age. This leads to neurological defects as the action potential can not pass so rapidly {{down the length of the}} axon during nerual stimulation. Removing the ligand for MAG, by knocking-out the GalNAc transferase gene required for ligand formation, has similar effects to that of the MAG knock-out mice ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In the lymphatic {{vessels of}} man and most animals the nerve fibers are {{confined}} to the adventitia. However, immunohistochemical studies suggest that acetylcholinesterase-positive and monoamine-containing fibers reach {{as far as the}} endothelium in bovines. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify the presence of subendothelial nerve fibers by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in bovine mesenteric lymphatics and to determine whether typical sensory neurotransmitters such as Substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) could be detected in these fibers. TEM revealed numerous unmyelinated nerve fibers in the subendothelial connective environment in close association with endothelial cells. Their axons were devoid of <b>Schwann</b> cell <b>sheath</b> on the endothelial side and contained small clear vesicles and large nerve fibers were demonstrated to be SP and CGRP-immunoreactive with mouse monoclonal antibodies against SP and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against CGRP. It is hypothesized that these fibers act as mechanoceptors capable of detecting intraluminal pressure and vessel wall tension variations and of locally releasing SP and CGRP. Since SP, potentiated by CGRP, is known to be a vasoconstrictor in lymphatics, we propose that the contraction of bovine mesenteric lymphatics may also be neurogenic...|$|R
40|$|Carotid {{bodies were}} removed from cats, fixed in {{buffered}} 1 per cent osmic acid, embedded in deaerated, nitrogenated methacrylate, and cut into thin sections for electron microscopic study. The carotid body is seen to be composed of islands of chemoreceptor and sustentacular cells surrounded by wide irregular sinusoids. These cells are separated from the sinusoids by relatively broad interstitial spaces which are filled with collagen, fibroblasts, and many unmyelinated nerve fibers with their <b>Schwann</b> cell <b>sheaths.</b> The chemoreceptor cells are surrounded by the flattened, multiprocessed sustentacular cells which serve to convey the axons from an interstitial to a pericellular location. These sustentacular cells {{are assumed to be}} lemmoblastic in origin. Relatively few axons are seen to abut on the chemoreceptor cells. The cytoplasm of the chemoreceptor cell is characterized by numerous small mitochondria, units of granular endoplasmic reticulum, a small Golgi complex, and a variety of vesicles. There are many small vesicles diffusely scattered throughout the cytoplasm. In addition, there is a small number of dark-cored vesicles of the type which has been previously described in the adrenal medulla. These are usually associated with the Golgi complex. These findings are discussed in relation to the concepts of the origin of the chemoreceptor cell {{and the nature of the}} synapse...|$|R
40|$|The ultrastructural {{features}} of pulmonary arteries {{are described in}} lung biopsy material from 6 children with congenital heart defects. Right ventricular hypertrophy was found in all 6 children and increased pulmonary artery pressure in all but one. The presence of muscle in smaller and more peripheral arteries than expected for {{the age of the}} child was detected in all cases. Ultrastructural examination of the peripheral arteries revealed, for the first time, in the nonmuscular regions of human arterial walls, pericytes and intermediate cells (previously shown to be precursor smooth-muscle cells); in addition, new arterial muscle was found in the normally nonmuscular region. In the 4 cases where medial thickness of the normally muscular arteries was increased, the smooth-muscle cells were hypertrophied and the extracellular connective tissue increased. In all cases, junctions between endothelial cells and smooth-muscle cells, intermediate cells, or pericytes were found. These changes are similar to those described in the rat with hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. In addition, in 2 of the 6 cases, bundles of nerve axons in <b>Schwann</b> cell <b>sheaths</b> were found in adventitial layer of small, intraacinar muscular arteries (not previously demonstrated ultrastructurally at this site in the human lung); varicosities with agranular and granular vesicles, probably adrenergic, were also identified...|$|R
