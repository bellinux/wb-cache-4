40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{hypothesized}} that one minus {{the slope of}} diastolic on systolic blood pressure in individual 24 -h ambulatory blood pressure recordings (ambulatory arterial <b>stiffness</b> <b>index)</b> might reflect arterial stiffness and predict cardiovascular mortality. METHODS: In volunteers and a population recruited in China, we studied concordance between ambulatory arterial <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> and established indexes of arterial stiffness. We assessed the predictive value of ambulatory arterial <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> in relation to cardiovascular outcome in Irish hypertensive patients. RESULTS: In 166 healthy volunteers, aged 22 - 83 years, the correlation coefficient between ambulatory arterial <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> and pulse wave velocity was 0. 51 (P< 0. 001). In 348 randomly recruited Chinese, the correlations between ambulatory arterial <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> and both the central and peripheral systolic augmentation indexes were significantly stronger than those for 24 -h ambulatory pulse pressure, particularly in study participants younger than 40 years. Among normotensive participants, the 95 th percentile of the ambulatory arterial <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> was 0. 55 in 234 Chinese and 0. 57 in 1617 Europeans enrolled in the International Database on Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring. The upper boundary of the 95 % prediction interval of the ambulatory arterial <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> in relation to age ranged from 0. 53 at 20 years to 0. 72 at 80 years. In 11 291 patients enrolled in the Dublin Outcome Study, both ambulatory arterial <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> and 24 -h ambulatory pulse pressure significantly predicted cardiovascular mortality. Ambulatory arterial <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> was a strong predictor of fatal stroke in normotensive participants, whereas pulse pressure better predicted heart attack in hypertensive patients.

Here, we wanted to demonstrate the appropriateness of pulse contour analysis to assess large artery stiffness in children. Digital volume pulse analysis, with the computation of the <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> and pulse wave velocity between carotid and femoral artery, were simultaneously determined in 79 healthy children between 8 years and 15 years (mean age 11. 4 years, 32 girls). The <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> of 42 healthy adults (mean age 45. 6 years, 26 women) served as control.

Increased pulse pressure is seen as a marker of increased arterial stiffness and can be readily measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.

A quantitative US device to calculate the <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> at the heel was used. Baseline characteristics, known risk factors for osteoporosis and fall, and the quantitative US <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> were used to elaborate a predictive rule for osteoporotic fracture.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} left ventricular diastolic function and its relation to aortic wall stiffness in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus without coronary artery disease or hypertension. PATIENTS: Sixty-six patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus were examined by echocardiography and divided into two groups according to the diastolic filling pattern determined by mitral annulus tissue Doppler velocities. Group A patients (n = 21) presented diastolic dysfunction with a peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity (Em) /peak late diastolic mitral annular velocity (Am) ratio 1. Coronary artery disease was excluded based on normal thallium scintigraphy. Aortic <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> was calculated from aortic diameters measured by echocardiography, using accepted criteria.

40|$|Background—Indicators of carotid {{atherosclerosis}} may confer additional prognostic {{value and}} guide clinicians in cardiovascular risk assessment. Carotid artery morphology (plaque burden) and function (<b>stiffness</b> <b>indexes)</b> {{as predictors of}} all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were prospectively evaluated in elderly men. Methods and Results—Cardiovascular risk profile was measured in 367 independently living men (mean SD age, 784 years). The number of carotid plaques was assessed by B-mode ultrasound, and arterial stiffness was quantified with a wall tracker system. During 48 months of follow-up, 70 deaths (28 cardiovascular) occurred. The total number of carotid plaques was the parameter most closely related to prognosis. In the age-adjusted multivariate Cox model, all-cause mortality was predicted by number of plaques (hazard ratio [HR] per 1 -unit increase, 1. 35; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 12 to 1. 64). Predictors of cardiovascular mortality in the respective model were number of plaques (HR, 1. 18; 95 % CI, 1. 04 to 1. 33) and Young’s elastic modulus (HR, 1. 68; 95 % CI, 1. 26 to 2. 26). Number of plaques improved the prognostic utility in any prognosis model when added to commonly available cardiovascular risk information. In contrast, <b>stiffness</b> <b>indexes</b> offered no consistent additive value.

40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY: Highly {{prevalent}} superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) injury {{results in}} compromised tendon function through fibrosis and high frequency of re-injury due to altered biomechanical function.

OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate a noninvasive in vivo assessment of tendon mechanics to investigate the effect of recent SDFT injury on limb <b>stiffness</b> <b>index,</b> providing an objective method to assess quality of healing. HYPOTHESES: Limb <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> would reduce as a consequence of SDFT injury and progressively increase during tendon healing and correlate with in vitro mechanical properties of the respective SDFTs. METHODS: Kinematic analysis was performed at walk in 10 horses that had sustained career-ending SDFT injury. <b>Stiffness</b> <b>index</b> was derived from limb force recorded via a series of force plates and measurement of change in metacarpophalangeal joint angle using 3 D motion analysis software. Horses were subjected to euthanasia 7 months after injury, the SDFTs removed and subjected to nondestructive in vitro mechanical testing. RESULTS: Limb <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> was reduced following SDFT injury in comparison with the contralateral limb and increased during the convalescent period, approximating that of the contralateral limb by 7 months post injury. There was a significant positive correlation between in vivo limb <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> and in vitro SDFT stiffness. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The ability to assess and monitor SDFT mechanical competence through limb stiffness measurement techniques in horses recovering from SDFT injury and the possibility of corroborating this with functional tendon healing may permit a more objective and accurate assessment of optimal tendon repair in the horse. This technique may be a useful method for assessing the efficacy of treatment regimens for tendinopathy and could be utilised to predict time to safe return to performance or re-injury...|$|E

We evaluated plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10), E-selectin, P-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM- 1), von Willebrand Factor (vWF), tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1). Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (Aix) were evaluated. RESULTS: There was a significant positive relationship, corrected for age, and gender, between PWV and CRP, TNF-α, IL 1 β, VWF and IL- 6.

METHODS: Twenty-four young women (18 - 30 years) in the third trimester of a normal pregnancy and 20 healthy nonpregnant women {{of the same age}} were enrolled.

40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the {{mechanical}} characterization of co-cultured spheroids of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) (HUVEC/MSC spheroids). HUVEC/MSC spheroids aggregate during culture, thereby decreasing in size. Since this size decrease can be caused by the contractility generated by the actomyosin of MSCs, which are intracellular frames, we can expect that there is a temporal transition for the mechanical characteristics, such as stiffness, during culture. To measure the mechanical characteristics, we use a microfluidic chip that is integrated with force sensor probes. We show the details of the measurement configuration and the results of mechanical characterization of the HUVEC/MSC spheroids. To evaluate the stiffness of the spheroids, we introduce the <b>stiffness</b> <b>index,</b> which essentially shows a spring constant per unit size of the spheroid at a certain time during measurement. From the measurement results, we confirmed that the <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> firstly increased during the days of culture, although after four days of culture, the <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> decreased.

40|$|Objective: In this study, {{we sought}} to assess the {{differences}} in cardiac and vascular end-organ damage in type 2 diabetics, with and without diabetic retinopathy. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 131 diabetic patients (44 with diabetic retinopathy and 87 without diabetic retinopathy). Retinography was performed with a Topcon TRC NW 200 non-mydriatic retinal camera. Using the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study Severity Scale, two independent observers graded the retinopathy. Pulse-wave velocity, ambulatory arterial <b>stiffness</b> <b>indices,</b> ambulatory arterial <b>stiffness</b> <b>indices</b> to blood pressure variability ratio, carotid intima and ndash;media thickness, and ankle/brachial index were used as markers of vascular damage. Left ventricular hypertrophy was evaluated by the Cornell voltage and ndash;duration product and Lewis Index. Results: A total of 33. 60 % of the subjects had diabetic retinopathy. The patients with diabetic retinopathy {{were more likely to}} be women (p= 0. 031), be insulin users (p= 0. 001), have a longer duration of disease (p= 0. 033), and have poorer blood glucose control (HbA 1 c 6. 98 in patients with diabetic retinopathy versus 6. 40 in patients without diabetic retinopathy) (p= 0. 012). Patients with diabetic retinopathy did not statistically differ from diabetics without retinopathy with regards to cardiac or vascular target organ damage. However, patients with diabetic retinopathy showed a trend (defined as a p-value ranging from 0. 051 to 0. 15) toward a higher resting heart rate, higher ratio of night/day SBP, higher ratio of night/day DBP, higher resting ambulatory systolic blood pressure measure (mmHg), higher resting ambulatory diastolic blood pressure measure (mmHg), higher ASSI-BPVR, and higher Lewis Index. Conclusions: Although the sample size limited the conclusions that could be drawn between diabetic retinopathy and levels of vascular and cardiac target organ damage, trends were observed in a number of indices for these conditions and measures thereof.

40|$|BACKGROUND Recent {{community-based}} {{research has}} linked aortic stiffness {{to the development}} of atrial fibrillation. We posit that aortic stiffness contributes to adverse atrial remodeling leading to the persistence of atrial fibrillation following catheter ablation in lone atrial fibrillation patients, despite the absence of apparent structural heart disease. Here, we aim to evaluate aortic stiffness in lone atrial fibrillation patients and determine its association with arrhythmia re currence following radio-frequency catheter ablation. METHODS We studied 68 consecutive lone atrial fibrillation patients who underwent catheter ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation and 50 healthy age- and sex-matched community controls. We performed radial artery applanation tonometry to obtain central measures of aortic stiffness: pulse pressure, augmentation pressure and augmentation index. Following ablation, arrhythmia recurrence was monitored at months 3, 6, 9, 12 and 6 monthly thereafter. RESULTS Compared to healthy controls, lone atrial fibrillation patients had significantly elevated peripheral pulse pressure, central pulse pressure, augmentation pressure and larger left atrial dimensions (all P< 0. 05). During a mean follow-up of 2. 9 ± 1. 4 years, 38 of the 68 lone atrial fibrillation patients had atrial fibrillation recurrence after initial catheter ablation procedure. Neither blood pressure nor aortic <b>stiffness</b> <b>indices</b> differed between patients with and without atrial fibrillation recurrence. However, patients with highest levels (≥ 75 th percentile) of peripheral pulse pressure, central pulse pressure and augmentation pressure had higher atrial fibrillation recurrence rates (all P< 0. 05). Only central aortic <b>stiffness</b> <b>indices</b> were associated with lower survival free from atrial fibrillation using Kaplan-Meier analysis. CONCLUSION Aortic stiffness is an important risk factor in patients with lone atrial fibrillation and contributes to higher atrial fibrillation recurrence following catheter ablation procedure.

Its portability {{allowed us to}} study the relationships between ultrasonic parameters of bone with age and with non-vertebral fractures in elderly women living in 19 nursing homes. Broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA) and speed of sound (SOS) of the calcaneus were measured (and the <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> calculated) {{in a sample of}} 270 institutionalized women, aged 85 +/- 7 years, using an Achilles bone densitometer (Lunar). The effects of age, history of non-vertebral and non-traumatic fractures, body mass index, triceps skinfold and arm circumference were assessed on BUA, SOS and <b>stiffness</b> <b>index.</b> Furthermore, to evaluate longitudinally the influence of aging on the ultrasound parameters of bone, 60 subjects from the same group had a second ultrasound measurement after 1 year. The cross-sectional analysis of the data on all 270 women showed a significant decrease (p < 0. 001) with age in BUA, SOS and <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> (- 0. 47 %, - 0. 06 %, and - 1. 01 % respectively per year). In the 94 women, (35 %) with a history of previous non-vertebral fractures, ultrasound parameters were significantly lower (p < 0. 0001) than in the 176 women with no history of fracture (- 8. 3 % for BUA, - 1. 3 % for SOS, - 18. 9 % for <b>stiffness</b> <b>index).</b> In contrast, {{there was no significant difference}} in anthropometric measurements between the groups with and without previous non-vertebral fractures, although the measurements decreased significantly with age.

40|$|Abstract Background It {{has been}} {{reported}} that there is an inverse association between osteoarthritis (OA) and osteoporosis. However, the relationship of bone mass to OA in a Japanese population whose rates of OA are different from Caucasians remains uncertain. Methods We studied the association of appendicular bone mineral density (second metacarpal; mBMD) and quantitative bone ultrasound (calcaneus; <b>stiffness</b> <b>index)</b> with knee and hand OA among 567 Japanese community-dwelling women. Knee and hand radiographs were scored for OA using Kellgren-Lawrence (K/L) scales. In addition, we evaluated the presence of osteophytes and of joint space narrowing. The hand joints were examined at the distal and proximal interphalangeal (DIP, PIP) and first metacarpophalangeal/carpometacarpal (MCP/CMC) joints. Results After adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI), <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> was significantly higher in women with K/L scale, grade 3 at CMC/MCP joint compared with those with no OA. Adjusted means of <b>stiffness</b> <b>index</b> and mBMD were significantly higher in women with definite osteophytes at the CMC/MCP joint compared to those without osteophytes, whereas {{there were no significant differences}} for knee, DIP and PIP joints. <b>Stiffness</b> <b>index,</b> but not mBMD, was higher in women with definite joint space narrowing at the CMC/MCP joint compared with those with no joint space narrowing. Conclusions Appendicular bone mass was increased with OA at the CMC/MCP joint, especially among women with osteophytes. Our findings suggest that the association of peripheral bone mass with OA for knee, DIP or PIP may be less clearcut in Japanese women than in other populations. </p...|$|E

Currently, vessel diameter is the principal imaging parameter used in clin-ical assessments [1]. Other imaging based measure-ments, including unique geometries [2 - 4] and wall stress [5, 6], have been proposed for further risk-stratification, predominantly for the abdominal and the descending routine. Aortic stiffness is a promising measure that has shown importance as an independent predictor of cardiovascu-lar morbidity and all-cause mortality [7]. It is a broad and early manifestation of pathologic changes within the vessel wall that can be measured with imaging using pulse wave velocity (PWV) or aortic distensibility.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} on trajectory planning and control of cable-driven parallel robots to improve the system performance. Stiffness and dexterity are the performance indices widely used in design and control of robotic systems. No previous work on adaptive cable-driven systems has discussed how to control {{the position of the}} pulley blocks to achieve optimal dexterity and stiffness. Considering a quasi-static motion of the end-effector, we neglected the active stiffness of the system and proposed pulley blocks trajectory planning strategies that maximize dexterity and elastic <b>stiffness</b> <b>indices</b> simultaneously for some cases of adaptive cable-driven designs by taking advantage of the increased redundancy. For non-adaptive design of cable-driven parallel robots, it is impossible to change the dexterity and elastic <b>stiffness</b> <b>indices</b> for a certain position of end-effector due to fixed orientation and length of cables; however, active stiffness can be modified by changing the tension in cables. Tension increment can be desirable due to stiffness augmentation, higher trajectory tracking performance, more precise motion and disturbance rejection; however, it can increase power consumption, and saturation in actuators may occur. Usually, cable tension distribution methods work based on a fixed minimum tension in cables. Such values are chosen through experiments to gain the desired trajectory tracking performance of the system, considering capability of actuators at the same time. To improve the system performance we proposed Dynamic Minimum Tension Control (DMTC) method. In this approach, the minimum tension is changing on-the-fly according to stiffness, dynamics of the system, and error values as feedback. We used a simple test bed to compare traditional fixed minimum tension utilization, and the proposed approach. Experimental results showed that the DMTC is more efficient than traditional approaches in terms of accuracy and energy consumption. Also an appropriate control algorithm can improve the system performance. The linear quadratic optimal control can {{play an important role in}} controlling cable-driven parallel robots by providing all the states of the system for the feedback, including velocity and position, in addition to optimal results. A linear quadratic optimal controller was designed and tested. The significant experimental results are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{protocol}} for measuring in vivo aortic stiffness in mice using high-resolution ultrasound imaging. Aortic diameter {{is measured by}} ultrasound and aortic blood pressure is measured invasively with a solid-state pressure catheter. Blood pressure is raised then lowered incrementally by intravenous infusion of vasoactive drugs phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside. Aortic diameter is measured for each pressure step to characterize the pressure-diameter relationship of the ascending aorta. <b>Stiffness</b> <b>indices</b> derived from the pressure-diameter relationship can be calculated from the data collected.

This technique {{can be used to}} investigate mechanisms underlying increased aortic stiffness associated with cardiovascular disease and aging. The technique produces a physiologically relevant measure of stiffness compared to ex vivo approaches because physiological influences on aortic stiffness are incorporated in the measurement. The primary limitation of this technique is the measurement error introduced from the movement of the aorta during the cardiac cycle.
