25|$|Apparently part of {{the royal}} agenda for the Council of Husillos of 1088 was the {{enhancing}} of royal control over Coimbra and its environs. The sole preserved document of the council was confirmed by a Martim, bishop-elect of Coimbra. Later {{in the same year}} a private document of Coimbra cited him, although still just as bishop-elect. Pierre David identified him as prior of the cathedral chapter of Coimbra and as the protégé of Sisnando Davides, who opposed the substitution of the Mozarabic rite (also known as Visigothic or Hispanic rite) for the Roman rite. But if Sisnando had proposed him and Alfonso had accepted him it is difficult to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> was never consecrated. This obscure dispute continued for in the following year (1089) one Julian appears as bishop and in 1091 a John. They are probably the same person. In the 1091 document the bishop was given permission to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land.|$|E

Two years later, {{he and his}} [...] co-author Roy Carr remarked of Harrison's religious beliefs: [...] "it's difficult to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> travelled {{all the way to}} India to import a God who, by the sound of him ('The Lord Loves the One [...] Loves the Lord') is as intractable and selfish as the petulant Jehovah of Victorian Sunday schools." ...|$|E
500|$|The tower's {{public spaces}} are clad in Breccia Pernice, a pink white-veined marble. Four gold-painted {{elevators}} transport visitors from the lobby to higher floors; a dedicated elevator leads {{directly to the}} penthouse where the Trump family lives. Mirrors and brass are used throughout the well-furnished apartments and the kitchens are outfitted with [...] "standard suburban" [...] cabinets. The building contains thirteen office floors on levels 14 to 26, then another 39 condominium floors containing 263 condominiums on levels 30–68. Trump later stated that he had placed the first residential floor on the level numbered 30 {{as part of a}} marketing strategy for all of his towers, and that he [...] "did not <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> should be forced to call the first residential floor something mundane like the second floor, or even the 20th floor". Many of the apartments are furnished, but some of the upper-floor commercial spaces come unfurnished.|$|E

500|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is {{planning}} to marry his girlfriend Elisa (Salma Hayek) as he believes she is [...] "", but Elisa tells Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) she has a secret. After asking Liz to tell Jack of her reluctance to get married, Elisa kisses Liz and walks away. Liz simply says [...] "I <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> (Jack) likes it". She confesses to Jack and Liz that she killed her first husband in a crime of passion after he cheated on her, and {{did not go to}} prison because she could not get an impartial jury due to her consequent notoriety. Jack considers marrying her anyway, saying that love requires one to overlook another's flaws, but worries about what would happen if he would ever be unfaithful. Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tells Jack that he has never cheated on his wife, Angie (Sherri Shepherd), which makes Jack think that he too can be faithful. However, when Elisa grows too suspicious of Jack's relationship with Liz, he calls off the engagement.|$|E

The names of many special attacks, as well as other concepts in the manga, consist of a form of punning in which phrases written in kanji are paired with an idiosyncratic reading. The names of Luffy, Sanji, Chopper, Robin, and Franky's techniques are often mixed with other languages, and the names of several of Zoro's sword techniques are designed as jokes; some of them look fearsome when read by sight but sound like kinds of food when read aloud. For example, Zoro's signature move is Onigiri, which is rendered as demon's cut but may also mean rice ball. Eisaku Inoue, the animation director, has said that the creators did not use these kanji readings in the anime since they [...] "might have cut down the laughs by about half". Nevertheless, Konosuke Uda, the director, said that he believes that the creators [...] "made the anime pretty close to the manga".|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2001–02 season, he had an {{unsuccessful}} trial with Cambridge United. He was then set to sign for Northampton Town, however, Kevin Wilson was sacked and the club's plans to sign the defender were halted. Stuart eventually joined Bury in October 2001 on a short-term contract, which was later extended to a two-and-a-half-year deal in February 2002. He made his debut for the club in the 1–0 away win at Hartlepool United in the Football League Trophy on 16 October 2001. He was sent-off in his third game for Bury in the 5–1 defeat to Brentford. Stuart scored his only goal for Bury on 22 December 2001, in the 1–1 draw at home to Blackpool. Bury went 1–0 down in the first-half, before Stuart equalised in the 53rd minute, with a shot that went in off the post. During his 18-month spell with Bury, Stuart was a first-team regular, making 61 appearances in the Third Division, scoring once. Bury finished seventh in the league during the 2002–03 season, qualifying for the play-offs. He also gained a total of four red cards and four yellows in the 18-months he was with Bury, including a red card in the 2002–03 play-off semi-final first leg against Bournemouth. Stuart was allegedly elbowed in the face by Wade Elliott, which resulted in his nose being broken and Stuart reacting by grabbing Elliott's shirt. Referee, Jeff Winter, adjudged Stuart had thrown a punch, whilst Andy Preece criticised Stuart for raising his arms to another player, defended him saying [...] "I can't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> thinks Jamie has punched him in the face...the explanation from the ref doesn't add up with what you see on the video." ...|$|E

2500|$|At Northampton, Worcestershire Royals captain Vikram Solanki {{led from}} the front, scoring 119 off 137 balls, {{including}} 13 fours and 1 six. Support from his colleagues took the visitors up to 211 for 4 off their 45 overs. Worcestershire director of cricket Tom Moody said of Solanki: [...] "I can't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> won't be in the mix for England section this summer. It depends how the selectors shuffle the deck, but I would imagine {{he will be in}} their minds for consideration at the very least. We were very confident he was ready for the challenge of captaincy and he has had a great start." ...|$|E
2500|$|Giladi relates that {{he became}} politicized after an {{experience}} at the Socialist/Zionist party headquarters. He had received a letter asking for help with their Arabic newspaper, and {{when he showed up}} at the headquarters and tried to show them the letter, he was dismissively told to report to the [...] "Department for Jews from Islamic Countries" [...] by many people who had not even looked at his letter to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> had been invited. He says that he [...] "was disgusted and angry. Either I am a member of the party or I'm not. Do I have a different ideology or different politics because I am an Arab Jew? It's segregation, I thought, just like a Negroes' Department. I turned around and walked out. That was the start of my open protests. That same year I organized a demonstration in Ashkelon against Ben-Gurion's racist policies and 10,000 people turned out." ...|$|E

Strangle what — the city? The country? No, {{something}} much, much bigger," [...] — she wrote in her 26 October 1917, diary entry. In late 1917 Gippius was still able to publish her anti-Bolshevik verses in what remained of the old newspapers, but the next year was nightmarish, according to her Diaries. Ridiculing H. G. Wells ("I can <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> is so attracted to the Bolsheviks: they’ve leapfrogged him"), she wrote of Cheka atrocities ("In Kiev 1200 officers killed; legs severed, boots taken off."

2500|$|Gun in Your Pocket {{was finally}} {{released}} in October 2012 as the B-side to Cool Zombie, the eventual first single from the album (which finally emerged in January 2013). [...] In {{addition to this}} song, Baillie and Adam Ant composed a second track about the Ross-Brand affair, Rubber Medusa, a song focussed mainly on Brand and written from Baillie's perspective. [...] Baillie's band, the Poussez Posse, performed this second song regularly in live support slots for Ant's UK tours during 2011–2012. [...] Commenting on the two songs in an interview by John Robb, Baillie noted [...] "The first one that Adam and I wrote was about an ex of mine- guess who! Which {{is not on the}} album, which is called Gun in Your Pocket ...(Subsequently) the first one Adam and I wrote together was Rubber Medusa, which was about Russell, Adam came up with the title which is a quote from the Jubilee film, (Brand) does look like a rubber Medusa so I <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> said it." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Witt, a close {{personal}} friend who introduced Landis to {{his future wife}} (the daughter of Witt's then girlfriend and future wife), shot himself with a handgun in the North Park community of San Diego on August 15, 2006. Landis and Witt met as roommates in 1998 when Landis moved to San Diego. Witt and Landis shared the same cycling coach, and Witt was instrumental in Landis' transition from mountain biking to road bicycle racing. Witt and his wife attended the 2006 Tour de France and were in Paris with Landis to celebrate his victory. Witt's North Park restaurant was adorned with Landis memorabilia, including two of Landis' jerseys. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that a Landis family spokesman read the following from a statement: [...] "Floyd, Amber and the family are devastated by the news of David's death. They loved him dearly, and they miss him. [...] hope their privacy is respected {{in this time of}} mourning." [...] Many years later, Landis claimed that Witt may have killed himself because of his knowledge of Landis' doping practices. In a 2010 ESPN interview, Landis acknowledged that Witt knew about Landis' doping and said, [...] "I'm not saying that's the reason he's dead, but without that, I don't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't still be here." [...] Even before the USADA's ruling on the matter, the controversy resulted in the disbandment of Landis's former team Phonak.|$|E
