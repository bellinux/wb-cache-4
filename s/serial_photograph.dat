40|$|Recent {{high-profile}} cases have made paediatricians {{very aware of}} the serious implications of either missing or wrongly diagnosing non-accidental injury. Subdural fluid collections in non-mobile infants usually represent haemorrhage caused by non-accidental injury. We report a 6 -month-old male who presented to the Accident and Emergency Department of Birmingham Heartlands Hospital with bilateral subdural fluid collections and skin ulcers resembling cigarette burns. Non-accidental injury {{was considered to be}} the most likely diagnosis. However, while under observation in hospital, the child's neurological condition deteriorated with progressive cerebral infarctions, and <b>serial</b> <b>photographs</b> of the skin lesions showed failure to heal. The revised diagnosis, confirmed histologically, was Degos disease, an extremely rare and often fatal occlusive vasculopathy. The child was treated palliatively and died 8 weeks after presentation.

40|$|Within {{international}} discourses on security, North Korea {{is often}} associated with risk and danger, emanating paradoxically from what can be called its strengths - particularly military strength, as embodied by its missile and nuclear programs - and its weaknesses - such as its ever-present political, economic, and food crises - which are considered to be imminent threats to international peace and stability. We argue that images {{play an important role in}} these representations, and suggest that one should take into account the role of visual imagery in the way particular issues, actions, and events related to North Korea are approached and understood.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Extensive {{alopecia}} areata {{is known}} to respond to daily oral corticosteroids. To minimize {{the side effects of}} daily corticosteroids, oral mini-pulse therapy with betamethasone has been used in vitiligo and other dermatoses. There are a few studies in alopecia areata also. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of oral mini-pulse therapy in extensive alopecia areata. METHODS: It is an open study on sixteen adolescents and adults with alopecia areata/ totalis/universalis treated with oral mini-pulse therapy for a minimum period of six months. The patients were evaluated clinically and with <b>serial</b> <b>photographs</b> for response and periodical investigations were undertaken to look for the side effects. All the patients were followed up for 5 - 8 months to look for any relapse. RESULTS: Seven (43. 7 &#x 0025;) patients showed an excellent response and five (31. 2 &#x 0025;) patients had good response. Two patients (12. 5 &#x 0025;) had unsatisfactory response and another two (12. 5 &#x 0025;) were non-responders. There were insignificant / minimal side effects.

A nonrandomized phase II prime-boost vaccine trial was conducted. Women with biopsy-proven anogenital intraepithelial neoplasia (AGIN) 3 were vaccinated with three doses of a recombinant fusion protein comprising HPV 16, E 6 /E 7 /L 2 (TA-CIN) followed by one dose of a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding HPV 16 and 18 E 6 /E 7 (TA-HPV).

This is the first trial of a prime-boost vaccination regimen using heterologous HPV vaccines (TA-CIN followed by TA-HPV) in the management of AGIN. Since the prime-boost approach in this cohort offered no significant advantages over single TA-HPV vaccination, there are no further studies planned using this protocol. Future studies are warranted to define responders to immunotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{physiology}} of the streptococci {{has been the}} subject of numerous investigations (see Sherman, 1938), the study of their morphology has received little attention, and yet the importance of the group makes such a study desirable. The present investigation is concerned with certain morpho-logical aspects of Streptococcus fecalis, one of the most common members of the genus. TECHNIQUE The organism was grown on paper-filtered meat-infusion agar on a slide, and <b>serial</b> <b>photographs</b> in dark-field were taken at short time intervals. The details of technique were recently described by the author (Knaysi, 1940). The temperature was kept in the neighborhood of 320 C., and the total range of fluctua-tion remained below 1. 50 C. The serial photomicrographs ob-tained were then subjected to the necessary measurements and calculations. FORM AND DIMENSIONS OF SINGLE CELLS 1. Form. The cell form of Streptococcus fecalis approaches the ellipsoidal. At the start of its life span, the cell resembles a flattened ellipsoid of revolution which gradually evolves to become an elongated ellipsoid of revolution. During this transition, the cell assumes momentarily the spherical shape. Strictly spherical cells are, therefore, seldom encountered in a growing culture of Streptococcus fecalis as represented by the strain used in these experiments...|$|R
40|$|Architectural media {{operate at}} {{different}} speeds. This fact was evident to the French engineers who routinely documented {{the construction of}} industrial buildings and infrastructure with photography in Paris during the late nineteenth century. In this period, French engineers principally worked as managers, as the industrialization of the Parisian worksite emerged in concert with preoccupations about oversight and supervision. Such concerns had surfaced with changing conceptions of time under industrial capitalism as exemplified by the standardization of timekeeping after 1884 that was necessitated by new technologies such as the telegraph and the railroad. Working under new regimes of time, engineers consistently commissioned <b>serial</b> <b>photographs</b> of the construction process taken at timed intervals. Such images visualized and verified the expediency and efficiency of labor, building materials, and methods of construction within the expanding bureaucracy of the state’s administrations for building. This paper contends that construction photographs, as they clocked the phases of construction, played a supportive role {{in the production of}} engineering knowledge at a moment when engineers operated according to a managerial paradigm. Accordingly, construction photographs participated in a broader cultural field, contributing to the industrialization of the worksite and of time itself {{in the wake of the}} expansion of urban capitalism during the second half of the nineteenth century...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a number of}} reports have {{appeared}} giving the results of analytical studies on viruses by high speed centrifugation. In most of these studies two general procedures have been used. One {{of these is the}} so called inverted capillary method developed by Elford (1) from the original Bechhold and Schlesinger (2) technique. It employs an electrically driven centrifuge of commercial type and depends on correlating after each of a series of runs the activity of sampled material with the time of centrifugation. No preliminary concentration or purification of the virus is required. The other procedure is an adaptation of the ultracentrifugafion method developed by Svedberg (3) for the study of proteins. The original method utilizes the principle of recording photographically the sedimentation of the material while the centrifuge is actually in rotation. The light used is of a wave length which is absorbed considerably more by the solute than by the solvent. <b>Serial</b> <b>photographs</b> are taken while the material is being centrifuged in a transparent cell, the sedimentation being indicated by differences in the amount of light transmitted at various levels in the eeU.

Both of the works create an environment for viewers to navigate either in New York City 2 ̆ 7 s Central Park or in the Seattle Art Museum, to feel soft textures and airy movements of fabrics the gates are made out of, and to experience the visual by being exposed to either interactions between nature and orange gates or a multi-media display {{on the surface of}} the gate featuring animations based on traditional East Asian paintings and <b>serial</b> <b>photographs</b> of the artist 2 ̆ 7 s childhood home. Since viewers are asked to pass the gates in these, there is no separation between the pictorial world of art and our mundane world of daily existence.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare two methods of scoring radiation-induced changes. Materials and methods Five-year photographs of 400 patients randomised to receive either 42. 9 or 39 Gy in 13 fractions to the whole breast after tumour excision of early breast cancer were compared with a post-surgery baseline and scored for change in breast appearance on a three-point graded scale. Two alternative methods of scoring using three observers were compared: (a) scores allocated independently, with independent resolution of discrepancies, and (b) scores allocated by consensus. Results Treatment effects estimated from the consensus and independent scores were very similar (odds ratio 1. 89, 95 % confidence interval 1. 21 – 2. 96 vs 2. 28, 95 % confidence interval 1. 50 – 3. 47, respectively). Agreement between the scores obtained from each method was reasonable, and the repeatability of the consensus method was good. Conclusions The consensus method of scoring photographic change in breast appearance seems to be no less sensitive to randomised dose as the independent method of assessment, but is much quicker to administer.

Vitiligo patches {{on one side of}} the body were treated 2 times per week for a maximum of 20 treatments with the excimer laser, and NBUVB phototherapy was used on patches on the other side. Improvement (repigmentation) was assessed on a visual scale via <b>serial</b> <b>photographs</b> taken every five treatments and scored as follows: 0, ≤ 1 % improvement; 1, ≤ 25 % improvement; 2, 26 - 50 % improvement; 3, 51 - 75 % improvement; and 4, ≥ 75 % improvement. At five treatments, the excimer laser-treated patches had an average score of 0. 26, compared with 0. 04 for patches treated with NBUVB phototherapy. A slightly higher repigmentation (p> 0. 05) in the excimer treated area was thus observed. At 10, 15, or 20 treatments, the differences between the average scores were significant: 0. 83, 1. 17, and 1. 39 for the excimer-treated patches, and 0. 17, 0. 30, and 0. 74 for the NBUVB phototherapy-treated areas (p< 0. 05).

Aims: To determine the efficacy and side-effect profile of Q switched Nd:YAG Laser (QSNYL) in fifty Indian patients. Methods: Fifty patients of nevus of Ota underwent multiple treatments (average 5 sessions) at monthly intervals carried out over a period of 2 years with QSNYL (Med-lite C 6). Of the 50 patients, 2 were males; and the rest were females. Skin types treated included phototype IV and V. The response after subsequent treatments was documented through <b>serial</b> <b>photographs</b> that were taken before and after every treatment session.

Isolated breast development progressed despite pubertal suppression with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue, which was stopped after 3 yr because of growth deceleration. Facial coarsening was documented with <b>serial</b> <b>photographs.</b> Sequencing and in vitro analysis identified a homozygous base pair substitution in exon 6 of the proband 2 ̆ 7 s GH receptor (GHR), which changed amino acid 131 from proline to glutamine (P 131 Q) and disrupted GH binding. Both the P 131 Q-mutated human GHR and wild-type (wt) hGHR were transiently expressed in COS- 1 cells, as demonstrated by Western blotting, but the P 131 Q- transfected cells did not bind I-hGH. Similarly, FDC-P 1 cells transfected with wthGHR bound I-hGH with high affinity and proliferated in response to GH, whereas the P 131 Q hGHR cells did neither. In CHO-K 1 cells cotransfected with wthGHR and the Egr- 1 promotor linked to a luciferase reporter gene, GH evoked a 2. 14 ± 0. 21 -fold increase in luciferase activity, {{but there was no}} response in the cells carrying the P 131 Q hGHR mutation.

Materials and Methods: This is a long-term study of the fate of facial asymmetry in four children who have undergone operation for muscular torticollis in early childhood. All the patients presented late, i. e., {{after the age of}} 4 years with a scarred sternomastoid and plagiocephaly, so conservative management with physiotherapy was not considered. All the patients had an x-ray of cervical spine and eye and dental checkup before making a diagnosis of muscular torticollis. Preoperative photograph of the patient′s face was taken to counsel the parents about the secondary effect of short sternomastoid on facial features and the need for surgery. After division of sternomastoid muscle and release of cervical fascia when indicated, the head was maintained in a hyperextended position supported by sand bags for three days.

40|$|Retinal fundus {{photographs}} are employed as standard diagnostic tools in ophthalmology. <b>Serial</b> <b>photographs</b> {{of the flow}} of fluorescein and indocyanine green (ICG) dye are used to determine the areas of the retinal lesions. For objective measurements of features, the registration of the images is a necessity. In this paper, we employ optimization techniques for registration with the help of 2 -parameter translational motion model of retinal angiograms, based on non-linear pre-processing (Wiener filtering and morphological gradient) and computation of the similarity criteria for the alignment of the two gradient images for any given rigid transformation. The optimization methods are effectively employed to minimize the similarity criterion. The presence of noise, the variations in the background and the temporal variation of the fluorescence level pose serious problems in obtaining a robust registration of the retinal images. Moreover, local search strategies are not robust in the case of ICG angiograms, even if one uses a multiresolution approach. The present work makes a systematic comparison of different optimization techniques, namely the minimization method derived from the optical flow formulation, the Nelder-Mead local search and the HCIAC ant colony metaheuristic, each optimizing a similarity criterion for the gradient images. The impact of the resolution and median filtering of gradient image is studied and the robustness of the approaches is tested through experimental studies, performed on macular fluorescein and ICG angiographies. Our proposed optimization techniques have shown interesting results especially for high resolution difficult registration problems. Moreover, this approach seems promising for affine (6 -parameter motion model) or elastical registrations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Alopecia areata {{is one of}} {{the most}} common human {{autoimmune}} disorders and its severe types are refractory to all conventional therapies. Corticosteroids have been used in severe alopecia areata since 1950 s but there is concern over complications caused by high doses of corticosteroids. Methotrexate has been used as an adjunctive therapy in some autoimmune disorders and has been proposed to be effective in the treatment of severe alopecia areata both as a monotherapy and in combination with corticosteroids. Methods: In this study, 120 patients of intractable alopecia areata totalis and universalis with a mean duration of 3. 27 ± 1. 60 years were studied. We treated them with methotrexate in combination with intravenous and low dose of prednisolone for one year. Methotrexate 10 mg per week was administered in combination with three monthly methylprednisolone and oral prednisolone 15 mg per day for one year. Response to the treatment was evaluated clinically and by <b>serial</b> <b>photographs.</b> Results: Sixty four patients (57. 7 %) gained total hair regrowth after treatment with no significant difference between alopecia totalis and universalis. Almost half of the patients (44. 75 %) remained disease free until the end of the one-year follow-up. Relapse occurred in 34 patients (56. 25 %); of them 20 % were focal relapses. Nine patients out of 120 patients (7. 5 %) experienced severe adverse effects of the therapy. Conclusion: Our study suggested that methotrexate could be used as a safe and well tolerated adjunctive therapy for severe alopecia areata although careful monitoring of adverse effect is necessary. Furthermore, controlled prospective clinical trials are warranted to answer many of the questions regarding methotrexate therapy for severe alopeci...|$|R
