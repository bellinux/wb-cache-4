Segments were color-keyed scene by scene so the colors in a single shot would harmonize between proceeding and following ones. Before a segment's narrative pattern was complete, an overall color scheme was designed to the general mood of the music, and patterned to correspond with the development of the subject matter.

5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{internal}} assessment (IA) varies by subject. There may be oral presentations (used in languages), practical work (in experimental sciences and performing arts), or written work. Internal assessment accounts for 20 to 50 percent of the mark awarded for each subject and {{is marked by a}} teacher in the school. A sample of at least five per subject at each level from a school will also be graded by a moderator appointed by the IB, in a process called external moderation of internal assessment. Based on this moderation, the grades of the whole <b>subject</b> <b>from</b> that school will change.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{newspapers}} Bosanski vjestnik, Bosna, and Sarajevski cvjetnik, the Vilayet Printing House published around fifty books and booklets in Serbo-Croatian, Ottoman Turkish, and Hebrew. While {{most of these}} publications were concerned with various Ottoman laws and legislation, the printing house also published a number of textbooks. The textbooks for Serb elementary schools in the vilayet were prepared by Miloš Mandić {{on the basis of}} those that were used in Serbia. These include an alphabet book (Буквар), a short Biblical history (Кратка свештена историја), a basal reader (Прва читанка), and the First Knowledges (Прва знања); they were published in 1867 and 1868. Mandić's alphabet book, the printing house's first textbook, was the second Serbian alphabet book using the reformed Serbian Cyrillic. The First Serbian Alphabet Book (Први Српски Буквар), authored by Vuk Karadžić, had been published in Vienna in 1827. The original plan was to print fifteen textbooks for Serb schools, ranging in <b>subject</b> <b>from</b> grammar, arithmetic, geography and religious teaching, but only four were printed. Although they were based on the textbooks used in Serbia, the vilayet's authorities made sure that every mention of Serbs and the Serbian language was erased from them.|$|E

5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the <b>subject</b> <b>from</b> his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig from her head, to reveal that the person he thought was a female was not a woman at all.|$|E
5|$|Odes {{were first}} {{developed}} by poets writing in ancient Greek, such as Pindar, and Latin, such as Horace. Forms of odes appear {{in many of}} the cultures that were influenced by the Greeks and Latins. The ode generally has three parts: a strophe, an antistrophe, and an epode. The antistrophes of the ode possess similar metrical structures and, depending on the tradition, similar rhyme structures. In contrast, the epode is written with a different scheme and structure. Odes have a formal poetic diction, and generally deal with a serious subject. The strophe and antistrophe look at the <b>subject</b> <b>from</b> different, often conflicting, perspectives, with the epode moving to a higher level to either view or resolve the underlying issues. Odes are often intended to be recited or sung by two choruses (or individuals), with the first reciting the strophe, the second the antistrophe, and both together the epode. Over time, differing forms for odes have developed with considerable variations in form and structure, but generally showing the original influence of the Pindaric or Horatian ode. One non-Western form which resembles the ode is the qasida in Persian poetry.|$|E

40|$|Day care {{at green}} care farms (GCFs) {{is a new}} care {{modality}} for community-dwelling older people with dementia. In view of the more physical and normal daily life activities available at GCFs than at RDCFs, we investigated whether functional decline differed between <b>subjects</b> <b>from</b> both day care settings. In this observational cohort study, primary caregivers of 47 <b>subjects</b> <b>from</b> GCFs and 41 <b>subjects</b> <b>from</b> RDCFs rated the subjects’ functional performance three times during one year. They also provided information on the subjects’ diseases and medication use. Generally, no significant change over time in functional performance, the number of diseases {{and the number of}} medications was observed, and no differences in these rates of change were found between <b>subjects</b> <b>from</b> both day care settings. This study suggests that GCFs are not more effective in maintaining functional performance or slowing down its decline in community-dwelling older people with dementia than RDCFs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{intelligibility}} of spoken Low German and Standard German for speakers of Dutch. Two aspects are considered. First, the relative potential for intelligibility of the Low German variety of Bremen and High German variety of Modern Standard German for speakers of Dutch is tested. Second, the question is raised whether Low German is understood more easily by <b>subjects</b> <b>from</b> the Dutch-German border area than <b>subjects</b> <b>from</b> {{other areas of the}} Netherlands. This is investigated impirically. The results show that in general Dutch people are better at understanding Standard German than the Low German variety, but that <b>subjects</b> <b>from</b> the border area are better at understanding Low German than <b>subjects</b> <b>from</b> other parts of the country. A larger amount of previous experience with the German Standard variety than with Low German dialects could explain the first result, while proximity on the sound Level could explain the second result...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE - : White matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed {{vascular}} origin {{increase the}} risk of stroke and dementia. Despite strong WMH heritability, few gene associations have been identified. Relevant experimental models may be informative. METHODS - : We tested the associations between genes that were differentially expressed in brains of young spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats and human WMH (using volume and visual score) in 621 <b>subjects</b> <b>from</b> the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC 1936). We then attempted replication in 9361 <b>subjects</b> <b>from</b> the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE). We also tested the <b>subjects</b> <b>from</b> LBC 1936 for previous genome-wide WMH associations found in <b>subjects</b> <b>from</b> CHARGE. RESULTS - : Of 126 spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat genes, 10 were nominally associated with WMH volume or score in <b>subjects</b> <b>from</b> LBC 1936, of which 5 (AFP, ALB, GNAI 1, RBM 8 a, and MRPL 18) were associated with both WMH volume and score (P< 0. 05); 2 of the 10 (XPNPEP 1, P= 6. 7 × 10; FARP 1, P= 0. 024) plus another spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat gene (USMG 5, P= 0. 00014), on chromosomes 10, 13, and 10 respectively, were associated with WMH in <b>subjects</b> <b>from</b> CHARGE. Gene set enrichment showed significant associations for downregulated spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat genes with WMH in humans. In <b>subjects</b> <b>from</b> LBC 1936, we replicated CHARGE's genome-wide WMH associations on chromosomes 17 (TRIM 65 and TRIM 47) and, for the first time, 1 (PMF 1). CONCLUSIONS - : Despite not passing multiple testing thresholds individually, these genes collectively are relevant to known WMH associations, proposed WMH mechanisms, or dementia: associations with Alzheimer's disease, late-life depression, ATP production, osmotic regulation, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and cognitive impairment. If replicated further, they suggest a multifactorial nature for WMH and argue for more consideration of vascular contributions to dementia...|$|R
