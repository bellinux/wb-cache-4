40|$|In the four-annual Belgian <b>social</b> <b>elections</b> 1. 7 million {{employees}} elect {{in their}} enterprise or organization approximately 65. 000 {{of their colleagues}} to a formal position as employee representative. These formal elections are also the main moment employees are recruited as representatives, and have known strong gender equalization w. r. t. formal participation – presence and position on the ballot, chance of being elected, etc. At the same time, women remain underrepresented in trade union structures, have a lower chance of having a leading position amongst representatives at the enterprise level, have a higher turnover as representative, etc. In this paper we explore the drivers of this gender inequality by focusing on both the formal and informal recruitment processes at the enterprise level. More specifically {{we look at the}} experience of employee representatives of the largest Belgian trade union ACV-CSC, during the most recent <b>social</b> <b>elections</b> of May 2016. We do so by drawing on an unique longitudinal four wave survey (2014 - 2016) of candidate- and elected representatives, with waves bridging the <b>social</b> <b>elections</b> of 2016. This longitudinal datasets is linked with administrative data on individual characteristics, and matched with enterprise characteristics and a longitudinal dataset of individual candidate and enterprise-level social election outcomes (1995 - 2016). Using this linked individual-enterprise dataset, we look at the determinants of gender differences in both formal outcomes (probability of standing for re-election, being elected, fulfilling a complete term, etc.) and gender differences in the subjective experience being an employee representative.

40|$|Recently, the Internet {{has become}} a very {{important}} medium of communication. Many people go online and conduct {{a wide range of}} business. They can sell and buy goods, perform different banking activities and even participate in political and <b>social</b> <b>elections</b> by casting a vote online. The parties involved in any transaction never need to meet and a buyer can sometimes be dealing with a fraudulent business that does not actually exist. So, security for conducting businesses online is vital and critical. All security-critical applications (e. g. online banking login pages) that are accessed using the Internet are at the risk of fraud. A common risk comes from so-called Phishing websites, which have become a problem for online banking and e-commerce users. Phishing websites attempt to trick people into revealing their sensitive personal and security information in order for the fraudster to access their accounts. They use websites that look similar to those of legitimate organizations and exploit the end-user's lack of knowledge of web browser clues and security indicators. This thesis addresses the effectiveness of Phishing website detection. It reviews existing anti-Phishing approaches and then makes the following contributions. First of all, the research in this thesis evaluates the effectiveness of the current most common users' tips for detecting Phishing websites. A novel effectiveness criteria is proposed and used to examine every tip and rank it based on its effectiveness score, thus revealing the most effective tips to enable users to detect Phishing attacks. The most effective tips can then be used by anti-Phishing training approaches. Secondly, this thesis proposes a novel Anti-Phishing Approach that uses Training Intervention for Phishing Websites' Detection (APTIPWD) and shows that it can be easily implemented. Thirdly, the effectiveness of the New Approach (APTIPWD) is evaluated using a set of user experiments showing that it is more effective in helping users distinguish between legitimate and Phishing websites than the Old Approach of sending anti-Phishing tips by email. The experiments also address the issues of the effects of technical ability and Phishing knowledge on Phishing websites' detection. The results of the investigation show that technical ability has no effect whereas Phishing knowledge has a positive effect on Phishing website detection. Thus, there is need to ensure that, regardless their technical ability level (expert or non-expert), the participants do not know about Phishing before they evaluate the effectiveness of a new anti-Phishing approach. This thesis then evaluates the anti-Phishing knowledge retention of the New Approach users and compares it with the knowledge retention of users who are sent anti-Phishing tips by email.

He shows the importance of market incentives from different angles, without denying the central role of the institutions. His careful approach has not been reflected in the resulting laws, which end up contaminated by the simplistic spirit of technocracy. Wiesner studies the passage from individual choice to collective choice from the optic of public choice theory, and plays down the importance of the impossibilities derived from the <b>social</b> <b>election</b> theory. The article criticizes this option because it leads people to wrongly think that the market logic can be applied {{to a wide range of}} goods, including education and health.

40|$|The growing {{importance}} of the Internet Of Things in our society leads to the necessity of developing systems where each thing reacts to the environment, taking its own decisions. Agent based systems fit perfectly in resolving those challenges. The aim of this thesis is to study the communication in multi-agent systems through coordination and negotiation techniques, applying them in a practical case and analyzing the results given after the execution. The implementation of the study-case has been developed using the Gaia methodology  since it is easy, but complex enough to develop a small multi-agent system from an initial set of requirements. The strategies analyzed are the Global Planning, Structural Organizations, Contractual Networks, <b>Social</b> <b>Election,</b> Coalitions and Negotiation based on Game Theory. Analysis of the results leads {{to the conclusion that}} no strategy is the best in all cases. Each strategy has different strengths, such as efficiency, scalability and robustness. Besides, negotiation techniques yield to poor results when all the agents try to achieve a common goal...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{paper is}} based on the author's two-year research and fieldwork in Iran and examines the process of political and social changes since the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and the subsequent impact of the Iran-Iraq War of 1980 - 88. This paper focuses on the transition of traditional, small villages into rusta-shahr or small rural cities and the first and second nation-wide elections of shoura or councils which were the first steps toward self-government. The author is guardedly optimistic regarding this democratic process but warns of possible future social unrest if changes are not more "balanced" between cities and rural areas and if the employment needs of the burgeoning younger generation are not met, political and social consequences may be catastrophic.

Seven characteristics of a health system that support this thesis are mentioned: 1) the impossibility to make a demand of health goods and services exclusively from the supposed goodness of the demand theory (rationality); 2) our phobias, caprices, hypochondrias are a barrier between the preventive medicine or health requirements and the demand theory; 3) the oligopolic structure of pharmaceutical enterprises destroys the so called merits -efficient allocations- of competitive markets; 4) the insufferable assumption of the transplant regulation by the market; 5) the externalities derived from {{the formation of the}} health professionals; 6) the failure of the vaccination campaigns made only by the private companies; 7) the Impossibility Arrow Theorem defeats the ordinal criteria about the <b>social</b> <b>election</b> from the market. health, privates goods, publics goods, generics, transplants, pharmaceutics enterprises, market, frees, global, pharmaceutics enterprises, no discriminatio...|$|R
