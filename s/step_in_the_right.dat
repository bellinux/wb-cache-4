5|$|After the Square Enix merger, {{however, the}} {{individual}} teams still continued to program and customize their own tools for each game, which would eventually {{go to waste}} as only their respective creators {{knew how to use}} them. With the amount of assets and tools required by the in-development Final Fantasy XII and the impending advent of the seventh console generation, a common data format for the company was proposed in 2004. It was to be developed in-house and replace general-purpose formats such as FBX and COLLADA. Realizing the goal of an engine with a common set of tools proved to be difficult, as many production teams wanted to further their own interests rather than those of the company as a whole. Select staff members from different company divisions teamed up to work on the project on a voluntary basis, but their loose organizational structure failed to yield results. Nevertheless, Murata considered this group effort a first <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction. In 2005, he was appointed general manager of the newly formed Technology Division. Although this enabled Murata and his subordinates to talk about a company-wide engine more extensively, the lack of manpower again prevented any significant achievements.|$|E
25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is a <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E

Women in the video game industry describe the character as both a positive and negative influence. Ismini Roby of WomenGamers.com commented that Croft was not a sexist influence in 1996, attributed {{to the lack of}} prominent female characters in video games at the time. She stated that the over-sexualized appearance was overlooked because the character was a [...] "breath of fresh air". However, Roby felt that though Lara Croft's proportions have become more realistic, the character's personality was diluted by the developer's actions to appeal to a male audience. LesbianGamers.com's Tracy Whitelaw called the character a dichotomy, stating that though Croft is viewed as [...] "idealized" [...] with an [...] "unattainable body", the character was a great stride for the propagation of female characters as video game protagonists.|$|E

500|$|Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club wrote a mixed {{review and}} gave it a C+.

[...] Kościuszko argued that the peasants and Jews should receive full citizenship status, as this would motivate them to help defend Poland {{in the event of}} war.

A year after the Constitution's adoption, on May 14, 1792, reactionary magnates formed the Targowica Confederation, which asked Russia's Tsaritsa Catherine II for help in overthrowing the Constitution.

500|$|The Naval Institute's Proceedings {{magazine}} devoted {{space in}} two of its 1902 issues to possible improvements in battleship design. The first article was authored by Lieutenant Matt H.

500|$|The Maniac Mansion team {{wanted to}} retain the {{structure}} of a text-based adventure game, but without the standard command-line interface. Gilbert and Winnick were frustrated by the genre's text parsers and frequent game over screens. While in college, Gilbert had enjoyed Colossal Cave Adventure and the games of Infocom, but he disliked their lack of visuals. He found the inclusion of graphics in Sierra On-Line games, such as King's Quest, to be a <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> direction. However, these games still require the player to type, and to guess which commands must be input. In response, Gilbert programmed a point-and-click graphical user interface that displays every possible command. Fox had made a similar attempt to streamline Lucasfilm's earlier [...] and he conceived the entirety of Maniac Mansions interface, according to Gilbert. Forty input commands were planned at first, but the number was gradually reduced to 12. Gilbert finished the Maniac Mansion engine—which he later named [...] "Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion" [...] (SCUMM)—after roughly one year of work. Although the game was designed for the Commodore 64, the SCUMM engine allowed it to be ported easily to other platforms.|$|E
