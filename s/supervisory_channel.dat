2500|$|Optical <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Channel</b> (OSC). This is {{data channel}} which uses an {{additional}} wavelength usually outside the EDFA amplification band (at 1,510nm, 1,620nm, 1,310nm or another proprietary wavelength). The OSC carries {{information about the}} multi-wavelength optical signal as well as remote conditions at the optical terminal or EDFA site. It is also normally used for remote software upgrades and user (i.e., network operator) Network Management information. It is the multi-wavelength analogue to SONET's DCC (or <b>supervisory</b> <b>channel).</b> ITU standards suggest that the OSC should utilize an OC-3 signal structure, though some vendors have opted to use 100 megabit Ethernet or another signal format. [...] Unlike the 1550nm multi-wavelength signal containing client data, the OSC is always terminated at intermediate amplifier sites, where it receives local information before re-transmission.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} failure {{localization}} from both a practical and a theoretical perspective. After summarizing the state-of-the-art of failure localization algorithms and monitoring techniques, {{an overview of}} the most prevalent failures in optical core networks is presented. We review the role of the Optical <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Channel</b> and how it reports problems to the management plane. We analyze different equipment, investigating where most failures occur and how these failures can be monitored. We conclude that in-band OSNR monitoring is the most important monitoring technique for failure localization purposes. We give a general probabilistic model for failure localization and assess its limitations using the mutual information metric. We give a simple example for computing this mutual information and show that is it a valid metric for evaluation of the failure localization problem. For practical applications, with imperfect monitoring equipment and countless possible failures, the mutual information may be prohibitingly low. Initial analysis of the problem shows that we need intense and accurate monitoring in order to increase the mutual information for the problem {{and to be able to}} localize failures accurately...|$|E
40|$|A light-trail is a {{generalized}} lightpath that enables multiple nodes to statistically share an optical communication path (wavelength bus). A light-trail {{is different from}} a lightpath on account of its unique node architecture - that enables formation of unidirectional wavelength buses. A node in a light-trail supports signal flow characteristics of drop-and-continue as well as passive addition leading to formation of the bus. Apart from the node architecture, another differentiation between light-trails and lightpaths is {{in the use of}} out-of-band control channel (Optical <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Channel</b> - OSC) for dynamic communication. The combined effect of a unique node architecture and out-of-band control channel enables light-trails to provide capability of sub-wavelength grooming, dynamic provisioning and optical multicasting. These features offered by light-trails are critical for next generation emerging applications such as VoIP, Video-on-demand (VoD), Triple-play and Pseudo-Wire Edge-to-Edge Emulation (PWE 3). Current OSC based control channel requires engineering enhancement to provision dynamic and bandwidth efficient services over light-trails. We investigate into the control channel hierarchies in light-trail networks to provision these emerging services. Centralized, distributed, static and dynamic control mechanisms are proposed. Light-trail control for provisioning next generation services is considered through theory and simulation. © IEE...|$|E

40|$|Survivable mechanisms, {{including}} fault localization {{and connection}} restoration, are achieved {{by means of}} electronically analyzing overhead bits in opaque optical networks. However, unlike opaque networks, transparent all-optical networks are unable to examine signal quality at transponders. Consequently, locating and isolating failures and attacks (intentional failures) in transparent optical networks are much harder than in opaque networks. Likewise, connection restoration and path rectification are more complex. Therefore, previously defined survivable terminologies, models, and techniques should be evolved and re-designed {{with respect to the}} dissimilarities to be applicable to all-optical networks. Accordingly, this thesis proposes several fault detection protocols, including Fault Localization Signaling Protocol, Rolling-back Signaling Protocol, and Limited-perimeter Vector Matching Protocol, and a number of connection restoration and re-routing techniques, such as Open Link Restoration Protocol, Minimum Weighted-path Restoration Protocol, and Signaling Nested Reservation Protocol, which are feasible in all-optical communication networks. The proposed protocols are all implemented by signaling in the <b>supervisory</b> <b>channels</b> of the overlay model. Since these protocols use controlling signals only as triggering signs, they are not involved in substantial processes and delays. As a result, they are compatible to high-speed all-optical networks. However, the signaling mechanisms embedded in these protocols utilize additional bandwidth from the control network...|$|R

40|$|Currently, optical {{communications}} {{plays an}} important role in the transmission aspect of backbone fiber networks. However, there still remain two challenges in this field: one is the bottleneck between high-capacity local area networks (LANs) and the backbone network, where the answer is the broadband optical fiber access networks; the other is the bottleneck of low-speed electrical signal processing in high capacity optical networks, where one possible solution is all-optical nonlinear signal processing. This thesis will cover both of the two topics. In the first topic, the emphasis will be put on the novel optical access network infrastructure design to improve the access network reliability and functionality as well as the reduction of system complexity. In the second topic, the focus is how to utilize the newly-emerging photonic devices or newly-designed configurations to improve the performance of current optical signal processing subsystems for applications in lightwave transmission systems. In summary, this thesis introduces a series of novel optical access network architecture designs and transmission system technologies for optical fiber communications and discusses their feasibilities in practice from the research perspective. We hope that these proposed technologies can contribute to the further developments in this field. In the area of broadband optical fiber access networks, two aspects are considered: survivability and monitoring function. For the first part, several new network protection schemes among various access network topologies (i. e. tree and ring) are proposed and experimentally demonstrated, which could reduce the access network cost and simplifying the operation of the access network. For the second part, an interesting in-service fault surveillance scheme in the current TDM-PON is proposed via analyzing the composite radio-frequency (RF) spectrum of the common <b>supervisory</b> <b>channel</b> at the central office (CO). Experiment proves its effectiveness with negligible influence on the signal channels. In addition, a system demonstration of the WDM-based optical broadband access network with automatic optical protection function is presented, showing the potential of WDM technologies in the broadband optical access networks. In the area of nonlinear optical signal processing, the technology innovation is in two areas: new architecture design and the new photonic devices. For the issue of architecture design, the focus is on the Nonlinear Optical Loop Mirror (NOLM) structure. A new polarization-independent OTDM demultiplexing scheme is proposed and demonstrated by incorporating a polarization-diversity loop into a conventional NOLM, which offers stable operation using the conventional components without sacrificing the operation speed or structural simplicity. In another study the design of a novel OFSK transmitter based on phase-modulator-embedded NOLM is conceived and implemented, which features data-rate transparent, continuous tuning of the wavelength spacing and stable operation. For the aspect of new photonic devices, this thesis focuses on the applications of photonic crystal fibers (PCF). In one work, a relatively short-length of dispersion-flattened high-nonlinearity PCF (gamma= 11. 2 (W-km) - 1, D<- 1 ps/nm/km 1500 - 1600 nm, S< 1 x 10 - 3 ps/km/nm 2) is integrated into a dispersion-imbalanced loop mirror (DILM) to form a nonlinear intensity discriminator and its application in the nonlinear suppression of the incoherent interferometric crosstalk has been successfully demonstrated. The special characteristics of the PCF ensure a broadband signal quality improvement and make the DILM more compact and stable. In the other work, the small birefringence of this PCF helps to simply achieve the polarization-insensitive wide-band wavelength converter based on four-wave-mixing in PCF. Wang Zhaoxin.

40|$|Resolving {{disruptions}} is {{a continual}} challenge to providing quality, cost-effective transit service. While {{a number of}} recovery techniques exist to recover from disruptions, detecting a disruption, choosing a response and implementing it {{in a timely manner}} is a difficult task. Different agencies use different combinations of field supervision, centralized control, and traditional and advanced communication technology. While these different service management strategies have different results, there is no consensus on what makes a good strategy, nor a systematic method for evaluating a proposed strategy and predicting its strengths and weaknesses. The purpose of this thesis is to create a framework for studying bus service management strategies and draw general lessons from an application of that framework. This thesis categorizes 15 distinct disruptions in bus service, the most common responses to each, and the information and resources necessary both to reach a decision on the most appropriate response and to implement it. It introduces a spreadsheet model for starting with the number of disruptions an agency faces and its chain of command for dealing with them and calculating the number of conversations that take place and the demand those conversations put on communications channels. Values gathered from studying Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) supervisor radio recordings allow this model to show the unused capacity of communications channels, if any, so that the feasibility of a prospective strategy can be determined. This method of studying strategy is applied to CTA. It is found that CTA bus operations suffer from two bottlenecks. The control center relays delay reports too slowly for them to be useful, and the communications channels allotted to supervisors are less than they would be required to air all messages related to service restoration. As a result, street supervisors have few service restoration options available to respond to delays, and they lack the information needed to choose an option effectively. The net result is that minor delays typically go unaddressed until they deteriorate into major ones, and major delays impose greater cost on passengers than they should. The impact of adding handheld computers with real-time location information is studied, and it is found that this would let supervisors use a wider range of restoration techniques, allow them to choose the best technique more accurately, let them address minor delays before they become more serious and free the <b>supervisory</b> radio <b>channels</b> for more effective management of breakdowns, accidents and disturbances. It is concluded that there are inherent advantages in managing schedule adherence from the field and managing incidents from a control center, regardless of an agency's level of communication investment. It is further concluded that digital messaging has a natural strength in dealing with routine and well-understood instructions, while voice communication is essential for tasks that are less predictable or require collaboration. Digital messaging can play a substantial role in a good service management strategy but can never replace voice radio. by David P. Barker. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The basic task of a manager, in {{all types}} of {{organizations}} and at all levels, is defined as "the achievement of harmony ofindividual effort toward the accomplishment of group goals" Most managers {{have a variety of}} experiences of communicating withcolleagues, superiors and teams {{during the first half of}} their careers: some may have given presentations to internal or externalclients; others may even have addressed large audiences at meetings or conferences. Communication is vital for coordination andcollaboration within a firm, and for establishing relationships with clients. It is an essential skill for a manager. Today's businessworld places greater expectations on those who seek to lead. When recruiting new employees, increasingly companies say theylook for people with razor-sharp communication skills more than analytical ability. Boundaries have fallen at the national level,and this has been mirrored by an equivalent effect at the personal level. It is not enough to say what you want people to do - theywant to know why. "Knowing why" is as important as "knowing how". Beyond the extensive research done in job performance the past few decades, researchers have done some work on theorganization communication [...] job satisfaction construct. The prevailing evidence indicates these factors relate positively. Onlythree studies, though, have documented correlations specifically between. Jain's (1973) early study used a questionnaire interviewformat to examine the relationship between communication effectiveness of hospital supervisors and their job performance asperceived by their subordinates. Effectiveness criteria were supervisor communication behavior, supervisor-subordinatecommunication frequency and amount, employee knowledge of policies and procedures, employee communication satisfaction,and non- <b>supervisory</b> formal communication <b>channels</b> use. Results showed positive correlations between communicationeffectiveness and job performance, communication frequency and amount and job performance, and employee communicationsatisfaction and supervisor job performance. the positive relationship between organizational communication and job satisfactionappears to be well documented, while there is less reason to say this about the relationship between organizational communicationand job performance. Nor do we know much about the factors that compose organizational communication satisfaction andtheir interrelationships. Strong, continuing interest in the construct has appeared in books, conference proceedings, and doctoraldissertations. In summary, investigation of the organizational communication-job performance research indicates a need forfurther empirical study Pearce and Segal, 2004). Life consists of every single factor affecting a person’s life conditions. All the details in a person’s life compose his life itself. For working people that composition is more mingled as working life comes with a number of different subtitiles. As the thinkersstate the mostly seeked target of humanbeings is happiness. Happiness has always been the best motive of many actions. It ismost powerful incentive to make people perform their tasks. That vital emotion can be gained through some certain satisfactions,including life satisfaction, work satisfaction, communicational satisfaction and so on. Those are also interrelated, so one of thoseaffect the other one or two or all directly and intensely. In other words, with a deep dissatisfaction in one course, it is almostimpossible to reach absolute satisfaction in another one. Life satisfaction can be associated with health, wealth, achievements,relations etc by and large; however, the ranking varies for people and they set different standartds for happiness according to theirpersonal traits,life conditions such as their gender, age, educational background, religion, nation etc. and their voluntary controls on their lives (not like genetic and environmental factors). As to job satisfaction, it is more easy to define and confine it when itis compared to life satisfaction as it is associated with small number of factors such as, salary, promotion opportunities, theadministrators, extra amendments, rewards, work flow, co-workers, the work itself and the organizational communication matter. In today’s world the working people spend most of their times in working areas, so one can not deny the fact thet job satisfactionhas a major role in the perception of life satisfaction. A person’s job also determines a working person’s social circle to a bigextend, so job satisfaction inserts iteslf in the center of life satisfaction. Communicational satisfaction is also attached a lotimportance in literature on the satisfaction issue. Communicational satisfaction consists of tree main titles as satisfaction withinterpersonnal communication, satisfaction with a group communication and satisfaction with the organizational communication [...] The amount of information a working person receives, organizational communication climate, the transparency of verticalcommunication and the frequency of interaction among the working people are some of the factors affecting commnunicationalsatisfaction. There exists a strong realtionship between job satisfaction and communicational satisfaction. Being able tocommunicate in a healtyh way has a great impact at a work place, it makes the people have confidence and create a sense ofsecurity. This study suggests that there is a need to do more research to find out the relation between the life satisfaction andcommunicational satisfaction. Alas, there is not satisfactory evidence to shoe that correlation. Working prevails upon all the activities people perform for the big percentage of populations. In a modern world, having ajob is regarded as having confidence and retaining it. Working even in hard and poor conditions can be preferrable to beingunemployed. It is obvious that the satisfaction with the job has a lot impact on the satisfaction with the life itself. Similary, thesatisfaction with life has a lot to do with the job satisfaction. Today, it is impossible to take job satisfaction only as the financialsatisfaction as having a job means having a social life within its circle which determines a person’s likes and dislikes, ethics andprinciples, most of hid world views etc.. Creating healthy interpersonal relations and having qualified social sharings are vitalfactors to improve life satisfaction, so communicational satisfaction is a direct variation for life satisfaction. From this point of view, this study is important to show effects of communication on the workers. This study aims to form aframe to show the relatedness of life, job and communicational satisfaction. The key words, phrases and relations of the phraseshave been clarified, and also, the analysis of related studies in literature have been placed...|$|R
