5|$|Hanging scroll: Hanging <b>scrolls</b> {{originated}} in their earliest form from literature and other texts written on bamboo strips and silk banners in ancient China. The earliest hanging <b>scrolls</b> {{are related to}} and developed from silk banners in early Chinese history. These banners were long and hung vertically on walls. Such silk banners and hanging scroll paintings were found at Mawangdui {{dating back to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). By the time of the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the aesthetic and structural objectives for hanging <b>scrolls</b> were summarized, which are still followed to this day. During the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), the <b>scrolls</b> became well suited to the art styles of the artists, consequently hanging <b>scrolls</b> were made in many different sizes and proportions.|$|E

5|$|Today {{there remain}} four paper <b>scrolls</b> of the emaki in varying {{condition}} {{and stored in}} different collections: Hachisuka, Matsudaira, Hinohara <b>scrolls</b> (Tokyo), and Fujita scroll (Fujita Art Museum, Osaka).

This difference in time indicates that the original emaki most likely consisted of more <b>scrolls</b> than exist today.|$|E

40|$|<b>Scroll</b> profile plays a {{key role}} in {{determining}} the performance of a <b>scroll</b> compressor. In this study geometric and dynamic characteristics of the <b>scroll</b> profile are analyzed to investigate the influence of its geometric continuity on property of a <b>scroll</b> compressor. Firstly, <b>scroll</b> profiles are created to redesign the geometry of <b>scroll</b> wrap by using the equidistant-curve approach on the basis of a generation line consisting of involute of circle and circular arc. Subsequently, the geometric and dynamic models of the <b>scroll</b> compressor are established. These models are related to parameters of the generation line of <b>scroll</b> profile and rotation angle of a moving <b>scroll.</b> Lastly, some simulation examples of second-order continuity (SOC) <b>scroll</b> profile are compared with first-order continuity (FOC) <b>scroll</b> profiles and some important conclusions are obtained. Results show that SOC <b>scroll</b> profile is superior to FOC profile in terms of volume ratio, stability of gas force, and possible leakage loss in a <b>scroll</b> compressor...|$|R

50|$|The arrow {{buttons on}} the {{keyboard}} may be clicked to <b>scroll</b> up, down, left, or right on a page.

40|$|Flick <b>scrolling</b> is {{a natural}} <b>scrolling</b> method for mobile touch devices such as the iPhoneTM. It is useful {{not only for its}} {{performance}} but perhaps even more so for its ease of use and user experience. Tilt <b>scrolling</b> instead uses the device’s tilt to determine the rate of <b>scrolling,</b> which offers several potential interaction advantages over touch sensitive alterna-tives: <b>scrolling</b> can be achieved without occluding {{a large proportion of the}} screen with a hand, finger, or thumb; it frees drag input events for other important actions such as text selection and drag-and-drop; and it works regardless of the hand’s state (e. g. moist or gloved). Although previously described, the performance of tilt <b>scrolling</b> has not been com-pared to flick <b>scrolling,</b> which is now the state of the art. Furthermore, it is unclear how such an empirical compari-son should be conducted. To better understand interaction with mobile <b>scrolling,</b> we propose a new method of evaluat-ing <b>scrolling</b> interfaces in the context of reading or analysis tasks. These activities typically involve slow subtle <b>scroll</b> movements rather than large movements typical investigated in most <b>scrolling</b> evaluations. We use this method to thor-oughly compare flick <b>scrolling</b> and tilt <b>scrolling.</b> We show that tilt <b>scrolling</b> results in better performance for tasks per-formed while stationary while there is no significant differ-ence while moving. However, we find that participants prefer flick <b>scrolling</b> and walk faster when completing moving tasks with flick <b>scrolling</b> than tilt <b>scrolling.</b> Author Keywords Accelerometer, flick <b>scrolling,</b> mobile device, tilt scrollin...|$|R
50|$|<b>Scrolling</b> can be {{controlled}} in other software-dependent ways by a PC mouse. Some <b>scroll</b> wheels can be pressed down, functioning like a button. Depending on the software, this allows both horizontal and vertical <b>scrolling</b> by dragging in the direction desired; when the mouse is moved to the original position, <b>scrolling</b> stops. A few <b>scroll</b> wheels can also be tilted, <b>scrolling</b> horizontally in one direction until released. On touchscreen devices, <b>scrolling</b> is a multi-touch gesture, done by swiping a finger on the screen vertically in the direction opposite to where the user wants to <b>scroll</b> to.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of Hurricane Katrina and the {{subsequent}} 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans, the congregation's building at 7000 Canal Boulevard filled with at least ten feet of water, and Beth Israel garnered national attention after {{attempts were made to}} save its Torah <b>scrolls.</b> Beth Israel's rabbi, Yisroel Shiff, who had evacuated to Tennessee before Katrina hit, contacted Rabbi Isaac Leider, who had worked on ZAKA search-and-rescue teams in Israel for five years. After contacting federal officials and the Louisiana National Guard, Leider hired a helicopter to fly him to within a mile of Beth Israel, met with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) search-and-rescue team appointed to retrieve the <b>scrolls.</b> The group used rubber rafts to reach Beth Israel and enter it, where Leider waded into the sanctuary and rescued the Torah <b>scrolls</b> and their silver ornaments.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>scroll</b> {{compressor}} has the conjugate {{motion of}} meshing by the fixed <b>scroll</b> {{and the planet}} <b>scroll.</b> Several kinds of geometrical curves can be adopted to form the <b>scroll</b> compressor profile such as involute of circle with variable and constant radius, algebraic spiral, and so on, to improve the performance of <b>scroll</b> compressor. This study proposes a new <b>scroll</b> profile design using elliptic involute and two-envelope method {{to create a new}} conjugate meshing <b>scroll</b> of variable cross section. The curve of the <b>scroll</b> section on both sides can be specified as an arbitrary mathematical function. First, the base <b>scroll</b> swept out by the central base circle. Next, the base circle translation path envelope of the planet <b>scroll</b> is moved by the basic involute curve. The base circle translation path envelope is the first envelope. The second envelope generated by the planet <b>scroll</b> conjugate profile is the fixed <b>scroll.</b> By using two-envelope method, the variety of conjugate <b>scroll</b> can be produce with the cross section and symmetrical variables for parametric design...|$|R
