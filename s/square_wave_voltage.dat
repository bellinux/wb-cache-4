50|$|ESTASI is a {{contactless}} electrospray ionization (ESI) method, like dielectric barrier ESI and induced or inductive ESI. In ESTASI, an electrode {{is placed}} {{close to a}} sample only separated by an insulation layer. The sample {{is covered with a}} droplet of solution (nano-liters to micro-liters); and a square wave HV is applied between the electrode and the mass spectrometer inlet capillary. Sample ionization occurs and ions are collected for mass spectrometry analysis. The square wave HV can be generated by amplifying the <b>square</b> <b>wave</b> <b>voltage</b> of a function generator. Alternatively, it can be produced by an electric circuit comprising one direct current HV power source and two switches that connect the electrode either to the HV source or to the ground.When a positive HV is applied to the electrode with respect to the mass spectrometer, a spray of cations is generated out of the droplet containing the sample analytes because of the strong electric filed between the electrode and the mass spectrometer. Excess anions stay inside the droplet on the substrate and are subsequently sprayed when grounding the electrode. In this way, both cations and anions are subsequently measured by mass spectrometry in one experiment.|$|E

A voltage of approximately 100 V was applied across the electrodes {{as a means to}} mechanically excite the devices and the frequency swept from 400 to 600 KHz for the device in Figure 3 a and from 10 to 35 KHz for the device in Figure 3 b. The optical microscope was initially in focus {{on the surface of the}} Au/PC film. As the frequency of the applied voltage reaches the resonant frequency of the nano resonator, the Au/PC film is exited and starts to vibrate. As a result, the surface of the Au/PC film in the microscope becomes out of focus. The frequency as a change in focus of the Au/PC film surface was recorded as the resonate frequency. In this way, the resonant frequencies were estimated to be 520 and 25 KHz, respectively. It is expected that the resonant frequency of a hybrid nano resonator depends on both the geometric parameters of the design (i.e., the width of the cavity over which Au/PC is fabricated, the thickness of the Au/PC film) and the mechanical properties of the constituent materials (i.e., elastic moduli of Au and PC). For example, a similar nano resonator fabricated over a narrower cavity has a higher resonant frequency, with all other parameters remaining the same.|$|R
