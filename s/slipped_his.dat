5|$|Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset, was a {{prominent}} Lancastrian and one of Margaret's trusted men. Interactions between Somerset and Warwick were less than cordial; the Nevilles and Beauforts had been feuding over estates since the early 1450s. Adding to their animosity was the death of Somerset's father, the 2nd Duke, at the First Battle of St Albans. The Yorkists won the engagement after Warwick <b>slipped</b> <b>his</b> force past the Lancastrian defence and attacked from behind. The Beauforts largely blamed the Earl for the Duke's death. Somerset is listed in early chronicles as {{a participant in the}} Battle of Barnet; however, this has been disputed. When the Lancastrians retook England, Warwick ordered the duke to watch over Henry VI in London. Several historians, such as Ross and Anthony Goodman, agree that Somerset left London to welcome Margaret in the south. Michael Jones points out that the Duke is recorded as having been in Salisbury {{on the day of the}} battle, trying to recruit townsmen for the Lancastrian cause. Trevor Royle suggests that due to Somerset's distrust of Warwick, the Duke would rather await his queen and her army than voluntarily aid the Earl. Therefore, it is unlikely that he fought at Barnet.|$|E
5|$|Lhermitte {{approached}} the anchored ships at 18:00, flying false Danish colours, and anchored nearby. A ship's boat from Camel {{approached the}} new arrival, rapidly realising that Preneuse was a hostile frigate {{and returning to}} their ship. Lieutenant William Fothergill, the most senior officer with the convoy, fired warning shots close to the frigate, which Lhermitte ignored. Both British ships then prepared for action. At 20:30, Preneuse began to approach Rattlesnake and Fothergill opened fire immediately, joined by Camel. Lhermitte returned fire, focusing its broadside on Camel. By midnight Camel had taken several shot in the hull causing widespread flooding, and the crew ceased firing to man the pumps. Lhermitte apparently believed that Camel had abandoned the fight and he switched fire towards Rattlesnake, the engagement continuing until 03:30 at which point Lhermitte <b>slipped</b> <b>his</b> anchor and pulled out of range. Remaining in the bay until 10:00 before standing out to sea. British losses were two killed and twelve wounded, both Camel and Rattlesnake badly damaged. It was later reported in French sources that Lhermitte believed the schooner Surprise to be a well armed naval brig, prompting his withdrawal. Preneuses loss in the action was around 40 killed and wounded, and the frigate {{was reported to be}} badly damaged; messages to this effect were hastily sent to the commander at the Cape, Captain George Losack who sent the 50-gun HMS Jupiter in pursuit.|$|E

500|$|The Bombardment of San Juan or the First Battle of San Juan (not to be {{confused}} with the Battle of San Juan Hill or the Battle for the Río San Juan de Nicaragua) refers to an American naval attack on the fortifications of San Juan, Puerto Rico during the Spanish–American War. The American Naval commanders believed the bulk of the Spanish Fleet under Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete was steaming from the Cape Verde Islands to the Antilles and ultimately to Puerto Rico. [...] With this understanding, Rear Admiral William T. Sampson and a squadron of ten American warships, the battleships , , , cruisers [...] and , monitors [...] and , torpedo boat , two unidentified auxiliary cruisers, and an unarmed collier had stood out from Havana at noon on May 2 bound for Puerto Rico.

Oswin agrees to deactivate the force-field in return for the Doctor coming to rescue her. Rory tries to give Amy his bracelet reasoning if loves slows the Dalek puppet conversion he will be less susceptible because he has always loved Amy more than she loves him. Amy angrily replies that she loves him equally, but divorced him because of her infertility.

2500|$|By {{withdrawing}} {{their ships}} from the Hellespont to Samos, the Athenians {{were able to}} reestablish their naval superiority in the Aegean, but in doing so they {{opened the door for}} Sparta to shift the theater of war. Accordingly, in late July, the Spartan commander Clearchus made an attempt to slip 40 ships past the Athenian fleet to the Hellespont. These were turned back by a storm, but shortly afterwards 10 ships under the Megarian general Helixus reached the Hellespont, where they triggered revolts in Byzantium, Chalcedon and other important cities. Several months later, the new Spartan navarch Mindarus, deciding that the promises of support made by Pharnabazus, the Persian satrap of Anatolia, were more promising than those of Tissaphernes in Ionia, <b>slipped</b> <b>his</b> entire fleet past the Athenians. [...] He joined up with the Peloponnesian ships already operating in the Hellespont and established his base at Abydos, forcing the small Athenian fleet at Sestos to flee, with losses, to Imbros and Lemnos.|$|E
