5000|$|In the Punjab region, Kabaddi {{is played}} on a {{circular}} pitch of a diameter of 22 meters and an inner circle with a line {{through the middle of}} the pitch: the pitch is called [...] "Kaudi da bharha". There are two teams of 8 players; one on one raid; and no player leaves the field. If 2 <b>stopers</b> attack a player, a foul is declared. Punjab style Kabaddi does not require the raider saying [...] "Kabaddi, Kabaddi" [...] throughout the raid. The game lasts for 40 minutes with a change in sides after 20 minutes.|$|R
40|$|Background The noise-exposed {{population}} in the mining industry in South Africa poses unique problems to the occupational audiologist working in this environment, due to the broad linguistic and cultural diversity in the audiology and mining environment. Unfortunately, the problems are also exacerbated by {{a high incidence of}} pseudohypacusis within this population who are incentivised by compensation for NIHL. A solution to these specific problems would be the reliable and valid use of an objective test of function such as the DPOAE. The rationale for the study therefore was to extend the body of knowledge about the use of DPOAEs in the noise-exposed mining population. Methodology The current study was divided into two phases: phase one’s objectives entailed the investigation of the characteristics of DPOAEs in a noise-exposed mining population; phase two aimed to develop a multivariate regression model that would facilitate the prediction of the hearing threshold levels from the DPOAE levels in this population. Objectives The objectives in phase one of the study were to investigate the bivariate correlations between DPOAE levels and air-conduction hearing threshold levels in noise-exposed gold miners, for the three stimulus procedures. The study also aimed to investigate the bivariate correlations between various pure-tone averages (PTA) and the DPOAE averages of f 2 frequencies closest to those pure-tone frequencies. Similarly, the Speech Recognition Thresholds (SRT) were correlated with DPOAE averages of f 2 frequencies closest to the PTA. xx The study further aimed to investigate the characteristics of DPOAEs in noiseexposed gold miners by comparing the average DPOAE levels for different age category groups, different ethnic groups and for different occupation types. Finally, phase one aimed to describe the characteristics of emission level and noise floor differences (DP-NF) in a DPOAE database of a noise-exposed gold mining population. Phase two of the study had the objective of developing a multivariate prediction model using stepwise regression analysis to identify which of the DPOAE frequencies produced the best prediction of the audiogram frequencies when multivariate inputs were used for each stimulus procedure. The objective was also to evaluate the use of the predicted audiograms’ calculated percentage loss of hearing (PLH) with that of the actual PLH. This retrospective record review used an audiological database from a mine in the North West province of South Africa that contained 4800 records. The required sample size to be representative of the population was statistically determined. The records were randomly selected resulting a sample size for the FB 2 -S group of 161, for the FB 1 -S group of 177 and the FB 1 -S group of 155 respectively. The hearing loss characteristics in the samples ranged from normal to profound losses with the majority being mild to moderate hearing losses. Results The findings of phase one showed negative correlations ranging from - 0. 327 to - 0. 573 for Frequency Band 1 - Replicated (FB 1 -R) between DPOAE levels and air conduction hearing threshold levels. Similarly, Frequency Band 1 -Single (FB 1 -S) and Frequency Band 2 -Single (FB 2 -S) also showed negative correlations (ranging from - 0. 203 to - 0. 609 and - 0. 274 to - 0. 738 respectively). These correlation strengths have been confirmed previously by other published studies. xxi Correlations between groups of frequencies on an audiogram and averaged match groups of DPOAE frequencies by intensity levels, both for PTA and SRT, ranged between - 0. 323 and - 0. 661. No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the DPOAE measurements and ethnic groups of African and Caucasian (Sample size of 175 for FB 1 -S, 137 for FB 1 -R and 161 for FB 2 -S). No differences were found between the DPOAE levels and the occupation types of mining team members, <b>stopers</b> and drillers. There was, however, a relational finding of a progressive decrement of DPOAE intensity levels by decade of age increase (Sample size of 37 for FB 1 -S, 45 for FB 1 -R and 155 for FB 2 -S). Mean DP levels in this population ranged from 1. 5 to - 14 dB SPL, and mean NF levels in the sample ranged from 0. 1 to - 16. 8 dB SPL with the mean DP-NF difference ranges form 0. 4 to 9. 3 dBSPL.

[...] "'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss <b>Stoper</b> {{has very}} kindly given me your address, and I write {{from here to}} ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much {{attracted}} by my description of you. We {{are willing to give}} 30 pounds a quarter, or 120 pounds a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train. Yours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.' ...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of blood contamination and haemostatic agents such as Ankaferd Blood Stopper (ABS) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) on the microtensile bond strength between dual cured resin cement-dentin interface. Material and MethodsTwelve pressed lithium disilicate glass ceramics were luted to flat occlusal dentin surfaces with Panavia F under the following conditions: Control Group: no contamination, Group Blood: blood contamination, Group ABS: ABS contamination Group H 2 O 2 : H 2 O 2 contamination. The specimens were sectioned to the beams and microtensile testing was carried out. Failure modes were classified under stereomicroscope. Two specimens were randomly selected from each group, and SEM analyses were performed. ResultsThere were significant differences in microtensile bond strengths (&# 181;TBS) between the control and blood-contaminated groups (p 0. 05). ConclusionsContamination by blood of dentin surface prior to bonding reduced the bond strength between resin cement and the dentin. Ankaferd Blood <b>Stoper</b> and H 2 O 2 could be used safely as blood stopping agents during cementation of all-ceramics to dentin to prevent bond failure due to blood contamination...|$|E
