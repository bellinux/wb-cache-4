50|$|One of {{important}} tasks of the Institute in start was {{the development of}} project of all-welded bridge across Dnepr river in Kiev - the Paton bridge, executed in cooperation with E.O. Paton Electric Welding Institute. Many pedestrian bridges across rivers were constructed according to the Institute projects: across river Dnieper - in city Kiev, across river Teterev - in city Zhytomir, across river Uzh - in city Korosten, and also suspension piping bridges across rivers Angara and Ural. Project of curvilinear bridge across Dnepr with lightweight <b>steel</b> <b>roadway</b> was developed during reconstruction of passage on Dnieper hydroelectric station dam.|$|E
50|$|All {{the member}} {{companies}} of the Eiffage group had some {{role in the}} construction work. The construction consortium {{was made up of}} the Eiffage TP company for the concrete part, the Eiffel company for the <b>steel</b> <b>roadway</b> (Gustave Eiffel built the Garabit viaduct in 1884, a railway bridge in the neighbouring Cantal d√©partement), and the Enerpac company for the roadway's hydraulic supports. The engineering group Setec has authority in the project, with SNCF engineering having partial control. Appia was responsible for the job of the bituminous road surface on the bridge deck, and Forclum (fr) for electrical installations. Management was handled by Eiffage Concessions.|$|E
50|$|Overall {{condition}} of the bridge was poor due to increasing deterioration of the superstructure and substructure, {{which resulted in the}} posted load limit. It was functionally outdated because the deck geometry provided a one-lane roadway for two-way traffic. The <b>steel</b> <b>roadway</b> stringers, floor beams, and trusses were corroded. It also had severe deterioration of the truss connection plates, and loss of bearing beneath the trusses and the bearing blocks at the pivot pier. Also, the northern and southern approach roadways reduced in width to a single lane upon approaching the bridge. Both northern and southern roadway approaches to the bridge sat on a sag profile that created sight distance issues for drivers.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, an {{overweight}} dump truck caused a small {{segment of the}} <b>steel</b> grate <b>roadway</b> on the bridge to sag about 1 ft. A quick survey promised to reopen the roadway, but automotive traffic was banned thereafter by the railroad.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the strong}} impacts or rockbursts in Ostrava-Karvina coalfield, which affect {{especially}} roadways and cross-cuts of longwall panels, {{it is necessary to}} strengthen standard <b>steel</b> <b>roadways</b> and breakthroughs supports. However it is a little different task in comparison with main solved problems of mining safety (Kidybinski, 2011), the use of reinforcing complementary bolts seems to be very effective. A varieties of numbers and locations of such rockbolts have been analyzed and compared from the viewpoint of the stability under dynamic events on the base of 3 D mathematic modeling. The method used for computer modeling has been FEM applied by ANSYS code. It deals with the shape and nature the following issues: the deformation of a steel support, strain and deformation of reinforcing bolts, the critical energy by which a permanent strain is caused and the influential interaction of the adjacent rock on the above mentioned characteristics. A recommendation for number and location of reinforcing complementary bolts is also contained. Web of Science 57120819...|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge is}} made up of 21,000 short tons (19,000 tonnes) of <b>steel,</b> and the <b>roadway</b> rises as high as 152 feet (46 m) above the Detroit River. Only the main span over the river is {{supported}} by suspension cables; the approaches to the main pillars are held up by steel in a cantilever truss structure.|$|R
50|$|Following Winston Churchill's famous memo 'Piers For Use On Beaches' dated 30 May 1942 the Mulberry project gained {{momentum}} {{under the}} direction of Major General D J McMullen and civil engineer Brigadier Bruce White. An early priority was the construction of trial installations in the Clyde estuary at Gare Loch. Hughes designed and supervised construction of a prototype jetty consisting of 'Hippo' concrete caissons sunk on the sea bed supporting 'Crocodile' <b>steel</b> <b>roadway</b> bridge units which spanned between the Hippos. The prototype was built at Conwy Morfa near Hughes' home town of Conwy and towed to Garlieston Wigtownshire in Scotland, where it was installed and tested against two other designs, both of which were floating roadways; the 'Swiss Roll' designed by R M Hamilton was made of canvas and steel cables, while the 'Whale' roadway designed by Allan Beckett consisted of flexible bridge spans mounted on pontoons. During the testing a storm washed away the Swiss Roll and created scour of the sea bed around the Hippo units, which in turn led to them tilting, resulting in the failure of the Crocodile spans. The Whale roadway design survived the tests undamaged and was consequently selected for use on the Mulberry harbours. One of Hughes' Hippo units did survive at Rigg Bay off Garlieston until it collapsed in a storm on 16 March 2006.|$|E
40|$|The {{work was}} focused on {{reinforcing}} of <b>steel</b> <b>roadway</b> support (reinforcing of particular arches and reinforcing of whole support facility) and measures for strenghtening and change of physical-mechanical properties of rocks and coal {{in the vicinity of}} gateroad which increase dynamic resistance of support...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology for evaluating alternative corrosion management strategies for a <b>steel</b> <b>roadway</b> bridge {{based on a}} total cost-benefit analysis. In this analysis, the impacts of girder type and preservation intervention selection on the bridge owner, users, and public are considered. The methodology is demonstrated for a steel girder bridge in Wallis, Switzerland. Painted carbon steel and unpainted weathering steel girders are investigated. The investigated preservation interventions are the following: protection by painting, protection by metalizing, and replacement. Deterioration of the girders by corrosion is modeled probabilistically. Following the methodology demonstration, sensitivity studies are performed, wherein the corrosion environment, traffic volume, and detour length during interventions are varied. The effects of these variations on the various benefit types are then discussed and {{the conditions under which}} the various corrosion management strategies may be optimal are identified...|$|E
50|$|The Edmundston-Madawaska Bridge is an {{international}} bridge which connects the cities of Edmundston, New Brunswick, in Canada and Madawaska, Maine, in the United States, across the Saint John River. The bridge consists of four steel through truss spans, each 70.71 m in length, for a total length of 287.12 m, which carries a two lane open <b>steel</b> grid deck <b>roadway.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The bridge also {{featured}} a rotating swing span opening for {{the passage of}} ships in high water. The bridge was only opened four times, twice for testing in 1913 and 1915, then in 1916 for {{the passage of the}} steamer [...] "Tarascon" [...] and in 1920 for passage of the Australian convict ship [...] "Success". In 1948 it refused opening of the span for passage of the steamer [...] "Gordon C. Greene" [...] citing inconvenience and costs of cutting power and communication lines, an action for which K&I and LG&E both paid damages to that ship's company. In 1955 the K&I sought and received permission to permanently tie down the swing span from the Corps of Engineers. In 1952, creosoted wood block roadways of the second bridge were eliminated and replaced by a <b>steel</b> gridwork <b>roadway.</b>|$|R
25|$|On Sunday 5 January 1975, a {{disaster}} occurred in Hobart when the handyweight {{bulk ore carrier}} MV Lake Illawarra collided with the Tasman Bridge in what would later {{be referred to as}} the Tasman Bridge disaster. The ship crashed into pylon 19, and then bounced across to strike pylon 18, knocking both pylons down, and also causing a 127-metre section of <b>steel</b> and concrete <b>roadway</b> to collapse onto the deck of the ship. The Illawarra sank, killing seven crew, and five motorists were killed when they drove off the gap, plunging into the river below.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In many {{design codes}} for roadway bridges, fatigue design {{involves}} passing a loadmodel over an influence {{line for a}} critical location on the bridge and then determining the resulting nominal stress range. For fatigue design in the finite-life domain, this stress range is then mul-tiplied by a damage equivalence factor to account for differences in the fatigue damage because of the loadmodel and the expected real traffic. In general, the effects of simultaneous vehicle crossings are not considered in the calibration of the damage equivalence factor. In this paper, fa-tigue design procedures in the U. S., Canadian, European, and Swiss codes applicable {{for the design of}} <b>steel</b> or aluminum <b>roadway</b> bridges are first reviewed. A simulation-based study, conducted to investigate the effects of simultaneous vehicle crossings on the damage equivalence factors for North American roadway bridges, is then presented. Based on the results of this study, recommendations are made for amplifying the North American damage equivalence factors in cases where the effects of simultaneous vehicle crossings are expected to be significant...|$|R
50|$|The Dodd Ford Bridge {{is one of}} {{only two}} {{surviving}} bridges known to have been built by Johnson while he operated as a contractor under his own name. In its design and engineering it is a conventional, pin-connected, nine-panel, 148.5 ft, steel truss of the overhead Pratt variety. During {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries, this general type of truss was commonly used throughout the United States for highway crossings of approximately 90 to 150 feet in length. Reflecting the prevailing bridge-engineering practices of its time, this bridge has relatively light construction by later automobile-inspired standards. The bridge employs laced channel sections for vertical compression members, paired eyebars for horizontal tension members and lower chord members, angle sections for overhead sway bracing and portal bracing, and crossed eyebars for top-lateral and bottom-lateral bracing. The bridge further evokes its period by virtue of its narrow 15 ft roadway with a plank deck supported on wood stringers. Such design was later prohibited by the Minnesota Highway Commission (established in 1905). The Commission advocated a 16-foot minimum <b>roadway,</b> <b>steel</b> stringers, and preferred a reinforced-concrete deck.|$|R
40|$|Fatigue of {{structural}} elements {{has been a}} major cause of many catastrophic failures of steel bridges. Corrosion is considered to be an influential factor that significantly contributes to the reduction of the fatigue life of steel structures. The objective of this research is to develop a numerical tool that is capable of predicting the fatigue life of steel members and connections while accounting for the effects of corrosion. To reach this goal, the research is divided into three phases. In the first phase, a stress-life damage accumulation model (called the VTLC, for Virtual Target Life Curves) is proposed and validated using the experimental work available in the literature. The model has the advantage of including the effect of overloading. The VTLC model was verified using a case study of a riveted railway bridge. In the second phase, a numerical tool is developed (named CorrFLP for Corrosion Fatigue Life Predictor). It acts as an add-on and uses available FEM packages as solvers. This tool is useful in predicting the fatigue life of railway or <b>roadway</b> <b>steel</b> bridges with riveted or bolted connections. CorrFLP uses the strain-life approach along with the theory of critical distances. CorrFLP is validated using several test results in the literature with and without the effect of corrosion. To account for corrosion, a new fatigue strain-life model based on the Smith-Watson-Topper model is proposed in the third phase of this research. The model takes into account the corrosivity of the environment, the stress level, and the corrosive behaviour of the material used. A method is proposed to standardize a testing protocol to evaluate some new material constants that describe its behaviour in corrosive environments. The proposed strain-life method is implemented in CorrFLP and the resulting fatigue life predictions matched well with reported experimental results of twenty-four steel beams subjected to various fatigue and weathering conditions. It is seen that the developed numerical tool, along with the corrosion-fatigue strain-life based model, would help structural engineers by generating several stress-life design charts to predict the fatigue life of several commonly-used structural components while accounting for different levels of corrosion...|$|R
