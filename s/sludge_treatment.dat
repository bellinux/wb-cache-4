5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air activated <b>sludge</b> <b>treatment.</b> This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E

Addition of water <b>treatment</b> <b>sludge</b> reduced water soluble C, microbial biomass C, CO 2 evolution, extractable P, and extractable heavy metals during composting. The decrease in CO 2 evolution (i. e., C sequestration) was greatest for poultry manure and least for biosolid composts. The effects of addition of water <b>treatment</b> <b>sludge</b> to mature green waste-based poultry manure and biosolid composts were also determined in a 24 -week incubation experiment. The composts were either incubated alone or after addition to a soil. Extractable P and heavy metal concentrations were decreased by additions of water <b>treatment</b> <b>sludge</b> in all <b>treatments,</b> and CO 2 evolution was also reduced from the poultry manure compost over the first 16 - 18 weeks. However, for biosolid compost, addition of water <b>treatment</b> <b>sludge</b> increased microbial biomass C and CO 2 evolution rate over the entire 24 -week incubation period. This was attributed to the greatly reduced extractable heavy metal concentrations (As, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn) present following addition of water <b>treatment</b> <b>sludge,</b> and thus increased microbial activity. It was concluded that addition of water <b>treatment</b> <b>sludge</b> reduces concentrations of extractable P and heavy metals in composts and that its effect on organic matter stabilization is much greater during the composting process than for mature compost because levels of easily decomposable organic matter are initially much higher in the feedstock than those in matured composts...|$|R

The three wastes were applied at 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 20 % w/w to three different composts, all containing extremely high concentrations of extractable P, and were incubated for 60 days. Water-soluble P was measured regularly throughout the incubation period, and at the end, P extractable with resin, 0. 05 M NaHCO(3), and 0. 005 M H(2) SO(4) were also measured. In the water extracts, inorganic P made up more than 85 % of the total P present. All three materials {{had the ability to}} adsorb P and thus lowered water-soluble P concentrations. Water <b>treatment</b> <b>sludge</b> was clearly the most effective material, and this was attributed to its amorphous nature (thus, large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area) and its acid pH (6. 8) compared with the alkaline pH (10 - 11) of the other two materials. Water <b>treatment</b> <b>sludge</b> was also the most effective at lowering resin- and NaHCO(3) -extractable P.

The power potential from sewage works is limited – in the UK, there are about 80MW total of such generation, with the potential to increase to 150MW, which is insignificant compared to the average power demand in the UK of about 35,000MW. The scope for biogas generation from nonsewage waste biological matter – energy crops, food waste, abattoir waste, etc. - is much higher, estimated to be capable of about 3,000MW.

25|$|The term biosolids {{is used to}} {{differentiate}} treated sewage sludge that can be beneficially recycled. Environmental advantages of sewage sludge consist of, application of sludge to land due to its soil condition properties and nutrient content. Advantages also extend to reduction in adverse health effects of incineration, decreased chemical fertilizer dependency, diminishing greenhouse gas emissions deriving from incineration and reduction in incineration fuel and energy costs. Beneficial reuse of sewage sludge is supported in EPA policies: the 1984 Beneficial Reuse Policy and the 1991 Inter-agency Policy on Beneficial Use of Sewage Sludge, with an objective to reduce volumes of waste generated. Sewage sludge contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus but also contains significant numbers of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and eggs of parasitic worms. Sludge also contains more than trace amounts of organic and inorganic chemicals. Benefits of reusing sewage sludge from use of organic and nutrient content in biosolids is valuable source in improving marginal lands and serving as supplements to fertilizers and soil conditioners. Extension of benefits of sludge on agriculture commodities include increase forest productivity, accelerated tree growth, re-vegetation of forest land previously devastated by natural disasters or construction activities. Also, sewage sludge use to aid growth of final vegetative cap for municipal solid waste landfills is enormously beneficial. Opposing benefits of sludge water result from high levels of pathogenic organisms that can possibly contaminate soil, water, crops, livestock, and fish. Pathogens, metals, organic chemical content and odors are cause of major health, environmental and aesthetic factors. <b>Sludge</b> <b>treatment</b> processes reduce the level of pathogens which becomes important when applying sludge to land as well as distributing and marketing it. Pollutants of sewage sludge come from domestic wastewater, discharge of industrial wastewater, municipal sewers and also from runoffs from parking lots, lawns and fields that were applied fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides.|$|E

Soil exchangeable Ca and ammonium oxalate-extractable Fe and Al were also determined at 100 d of incubation. The small decrease in P sorption in the litter and <b>sludge</b> <b>treatments</b> (25 %), compared with that in the slurry and KH 2 PO 4 treatments (52 %) between 20 and 100 d of incubation was attributed partly to the formation of new adsorption sites for P.

On average, the rate of P release decreased in the order: KH 2 PO 4 and slurry > litter > sludge, and was inversely related to exchangeable Ca content of the incubated soils (R- 2 = 0. 57). The slower rates of P release in the litter and <b>sludge</b> <b>treatments</b> (P < 0. 001) are attributed to the large values for exchangeable Ca (1050 - 2640 and 1070 - 2710 mg kg(- 1), respectively) in these amended soils.
