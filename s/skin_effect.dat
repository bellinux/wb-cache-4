25|$|An {{erroneous}} {{explanation for}} the absence of electric shock that has persisted among Tesla coil hobbyists is that the high frequency currents travel through the body close to the surface, and thus do not penetrate to vital organs or nerves, due to an electromagnetic phenomenon called <b>skin</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
25|$|Here ε and µ {{denote the}} {{dielectric}} constant and magnetic permeability {{of the medium}} that the conductors are embedded in. There is no electric and no magnetic field inside the conductors (complete <b>skin</b> <b>effect,</b> high frequency). Current flows down on one line and returns on the other.

25|$|Alpha and beta {{radiation}} have low penetrating power and {{are unlikely to}} affect vital internal organs from outside the body. Any type of ionizing radiation can cause burns, but alpha and {{beta radiation}} {{can only do so}} if radioactive contamination or nuclear fallout is deposited on the individual's skin or clothing. Gamma and neutron radiation can travel much further distances and penetrate the body easily, so whole-body irradiation generally causes ARS before <b>skin</b> <b>effects</b> are evident. Local gamma irradiation can cause <b>skin</b> <b>effects</b> without any sickness. In the early twentieth century, radiographers would commonly calibrate their machines by irradiating their own hand and measuring the time to onset of erythema.|$|R
25|$|Each winding is also {{limited to}} a single layer of wire, which reduces {{proximity}} effect losses. The primary carries very high currents. Since high frequency current mostly flows {{on the surface of}} conductors due to <b>skin</b> <b>effect,</b> it is often made of copper tubing or strip with a large surface area to reduce resistance, and its turns are spaced apart, which reduces proximity effect losses and arcing between turns.|$|E
25|$|Lightning {{protection}} systems {{are designed to}} mitigate the effects of lightning through connection to extensive grounding systems that provide a large surface area connection to earth. The large area is required to dissipate the high current of a lightning strike without damaging the system conductors by excess heat. Since lightning strikes are pulses of energy with very high frequency components, grounding systems for lightning protection tend to use short straight runs of conductors to reduce the self-inductance and <b>skin</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the most}} general case, {{inductance}} {{can be calculated}} from Maxwell's equations. Many important cases can be solved using simplifications. Where high frequency currents are considered, with <b>skin</b> <b>effect,</b> the surface current densities and magnetic field may be obtained by solving the Laplace equation. Where the conductors are thin wires, self-inductance still depends on the wire radius {{and the distribution of}} the current in the wire. This current distribution is approximately constant (on the surface or in the volume of the wire) for a wire radius much smaller than other length scales.|$|E

25|$|In 1880, Heaviside {{researched}} the <b>skin</b> <b>effect</b> in telegraph transmission lines. That same year he patented, in England, the coaxial cable. In 1884 he recast Maxwell's mathematical analysis {{from its original}} cumbersome form (they had already been recast as quaternions) to its modern vector terminology, thereby reducing twelve of the original twenty equations in twenty unknowns down to the four differential equations in two unknowns we now know as Maxwell's equations. The four re-formulated Maxwell's equations describe the nature of electric charges (both static and moving), magnetic fields, {{and the relationship between}} the two, namely electromagnetic fields.|$|E
25|$|Thonemann {{continued}} {{working on}} the idea and began a rigorous programme to explore the basic physics of plasmas in a magnetic field. Starting with linear tubes and mercury gas, {{he found that the}} current tended to expand outward through the plasma until it touched the walls of the container (see <b>skin</b> <b>effect).</b> He countered this with the addition of small electromagnets outside the tube, which pushed back against the current and kept it centred. By 1949, he had moved on from the glass tubes to a larger copper torus, in which he was able to demonstrate a stable pinched plasma. Frederick Lindemann and Cockroft visited and were duly impressed.|$|E
25|$|For low {{to medium}} frequencies, {{conductors}} {{can be divided}} into stranded wires, each insulated from one another, and the relative positions of individual strands specially arranged within the conductor bundle. Wire constructed using this technique is called Litz wire. This measure helps to partially mitigate <b>skin</b> <b>effect</b> by forcing more equal current throughout the total cross section of the stranded conductors. Litz wire is used for making high-Q inductors, reducing losses in flexible conductors carrying very high currents at lower frequencies, and in the windings of devices carrying higher radio frequency current (up to hundreds of kilohertz), such as switch-mode power supplies and radio frequency transformers.|$|E

40|$|Based on Mindlin's {{theory for}} {{material}} micro-structure interesting surface effects {{under conditions of}} equilibrium are studied in this paper.

Experimental as well as fracture mechanics based considerations show that this surface-layer is extremely thin for metals while for brittle materials its magnitude is {{of the order of}} 1 cm. Material microstructure introduces a singular perturbation to the original Hill and Hutchinson problem; here we introduce a single perturbation parameter and we obtain a "dispersion" law for the surface buckling load. It is found that surface degradation and <b>skin</b> <b>effects</b> can be attributed to localized surface buckling instabilities.

25|$|A {{direct current}} flows uniformly {{throughout}} the cross-section of a uniform wire. An alternating current of any frequency is forced {{away from the}} wire's center, toward its outer surface. This is because the acceleration of an electric charge in an alternating current produces waves of electromagnetic radiation that cancel the propagation of electricity {{toward the center of}} materials with high conductivity. This phenomenon is called <b>skin</b> <b>effect.</b> At very high frequencies the current no longer flows in the wire, but effectively flows {{on the surface of the}} wire, within a thickness of a few skin depths. The skin depth is the thickness at which the current density is reduced by 63%. Even at relatively low frequencies used for power transmission (50Hz – 60Hz), non-uniform distribution of current still occurs in sufficiently thick conductors. For example, the skin depth of a copper conductor is approximately 8.57mm at 60Hz, so high current conductors are usually hollow to reduce their mass and cost. Since the current tends to flow in the periphery of conductors, the effective cross-section of the conductor is reduced. This increases the effective AC resistance of the conductor, since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. The AC resistance often is many times higher than the DC resistance, causing a much higher energy loss due to ohmic heating (also called I2R loss).|$|E

In particular, R is heavily influenced by the <b>skin</b> <b>effect.</b> [...] Furthermore, while G has virtually no effect at audio frequency, it can cause noticeable losses at high frequency {{with many of the}} dielectric materials used in cables due to a high loss tangent. [...] Avoiding the losses caused by G is the reason many cables designed for use at UHF are air-insulated or foam-insulated (which makes them virtually air-insulated). [...] The actual meaning of constant in this context is that the parameter is constant with distance. [...] That is the line is assumed to be homogenous lengthwise.

2500|$|This {{theory is}} false. [...] RF current does tend to flow {{on the surface}} of conductors, but the depth to which it penetrates, called skin depth, depends on the {{resistivity}} and permittivity of the material as well as the frequency. [...] Although <b>skin</b> <b>effect</b> limits currents of Tesla coil frequencies to the outer fraction of a millimeter in metal conductors, the skin depth of the current in body tissue is much deeper due to its higher resistivity and lower permittivity. [...] The depth of penetration of currents of Tesla frequency (0.1 - 1MHz) in human tissues is roughly 24 to 72cm (9 to 28 inches). [...] Thus <b>skin</b> <b>effect</b> has little influence on the path of the current through the body; it takes the path of lowest electrical impedance to ground, and can easily pass through the core of the body. [...] In the medical therapy called longwave diathermy, RF current of Tesla frequencies was used for decades for deep tissue warming, including heating internal organs such as the lungs. [...] Modern shortwave diathermy machines use a higher frequency of 27MHz, which would have a correspondingly smaller skin depth, yet these frequencies are still able to penetrate deep body tissues.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{situation}} for which this formula is not exact is with alternating current (AC), because the <b>skin</b> <b>effect</b> inhibits current flow {{near the center}} of the conductor. For this reason, the geometrical cross-section is different from the effective cross-section in which current actually flows, so resistance is higher than expected. Similarly, if two conductors near each other carry AC current, their resistances increase due to the proximity effect. At commercial power frequency, these [...] effects are significant for large conductors carrying large currents, such as busbars in an electrical substation, or large power cables carrying more than a few hundred amperes.|$|E

In common with other PS4/Xbox One generation rendering engines the Panta Rhei engine used physically based rendering methods for calculating lighting reflectance; demonstrations based around the Deep Down Panta Rhei development videogame used a Oren-Nayar model for diffuse reflectance, Cook-Torrance model for specular highlights (replacing a Blinn-Phong shading model used in earlier demonstrations). Demonstrations used tile-based deferred rendering generally, with forward rendering also applied for simulations of translucent <b>skin</b> <b>effects,</b> and other transparent objects. Indirect lighting was demonstrated again, using a 128x128x128 voxel grid representing local light intensity, and voxel cone tracing along 12 directions (dodecahedral).

40|$|The {{flowback}} {{performance of}} multi-fractured horizontal wells completed in an ultra-low permeability (shale) reservoir often includes an anomalous flowrate feature at early times {{prior to the}} development of a characteristic reservoir flow regime (i. e., linear or bilinear flow). This flowrate feature is evident in all of the flow phases (gas, oil, water, and total fluid) and is caused by the "unloading" of the well (essentially the "clean-up" behavior following well stimulation). Our concept is that this flowrate feature is caused by decaying <b>skin</b> <b>effects,</b> a changing wellbore storage effect, or a combination of both a decaying <b>skin</b> <b>effects</b> and changing wellbore storage effects. For simplicity ? and as a proof-of-concept, this research considers only the case of a vertical well with a single vertical fracture, but the concept and relations developed in this work can be directly extended to the solution for a multi-fractured horizontal well. As noted, the goal of this research is to develop series of time-dependent skin and wellbore storage models to characterize the early-time flowrate behavior observed in practice, under the constraint of a constant wellbore flowing pressure. Our procedure is to couple case of time-dependent wellbore storage and <b>skin</b> <b>effects</b> with a set of reservoir flow models (i. e., power-law, bilinear and formation linear flow) and by applying the convolution integral to the constant pressure condition, we generate various scenarios of production performance. Specifically, in this work we provide derivations of the development of each constant pressure solution, where all work is performed Laplace domain and the Stehfest Algorithm is used to numerically invert each case to the real domain. A graphical illustration of the performance of each model is provided and a generalized workflow is presented (we note that this workflow can easily be extended to more complex fracture structures ? i. e., the multi-fractured horizontal well case). Although these models represent different physical phenomena, we observe that all of the proposed models provide some mechanism for representing early-time variations in flowrates. We demonstrate the relevance of these models, which are based on empirical time-dependent models for wellbore storage and <b>skin</b> <b>effects,</b> as proxies that can be used to represent early-time flowrate behavior. In short, we demonstrate that each time-dependent model has unique characteristics which could theoretically allow for characterization of fracture behavior prior to the onset of an undistorted "reservoir" flow regime (i. e., formation linear or bilinear flow) ...|$|R
