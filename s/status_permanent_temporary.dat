40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the effects of}} contemporary employment arrangements {{on the quality of}} nursing work life, and the implications of these employment arrangements for individual nurses, the hospitals, and also for the organization. First we look at nurse work status (full-time, part-time or casual job), contract <b>status</b> (<b>permanent</b> or <b>temporary),</b> and employment preference as factors affecting commitment to the hospital and profession, job satisfaction, retention in the organization, and absenteeism from work. Second, we examine stress, burnout, and physical occupational health problems (in particular, musculoskeletal disorders), as affecting nurse and hospital outcomes. This project investigated how the quality of nursing worklife and career choices differ for nurses in full-time, part-time and casual employment, and whether nurses who have the employment arrangements they prefer enjoy a standard of worklife that encourages retention. We collected data for the study from 1, 396 nurses employed at three large teaching hospitals in Southern Ontario (Hamilton Health Sciences, Kingston General Hospital, and St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto) using the New Health Care Worker Questionnaire. Results indicate that although a substantial majority of the nurses were employed in the type of job that they preferred, problems of stress, burnout and physical health problems were reported. Further, these problems affected the nurses' job satisfaction, commitment, and propensity to leave the hospitals. health care workers, employment status, nurses, job satisfaction, commitment, stress, burnout, physical health problems, MSD, propensity to leave...|$|R
40|$|An {{estimated}} 9 million Filipinos, about 10 % of the population, now reside abroad as permanent {{immigrants in}} advanced economies and as temporary migrant workers. The permanent immigrants who are {{mostly in the}} US, Australia and Canada comprise about 45 % of the total. The migrant workers are employed in varied occupations in very varied destinations encompassing all the world continents. The migrants' remittances have contributed greatly to GNP and foreign exchange earnings averaging 6 - 7 % and 20 %, respectively, over the past decade. The paper analyzes the migrants' remittance behavior using individual observations from an Asian Development Bank 2004 survey of vacationing migrants. The paper assumes altruism to be the principal motivation for remitting foreign income and finds empirical support from the data. A two-stage regression model that estimates the effect of predicted foreign income, immigration <b>status,</b> (<b>permanent</b> immigrant or <b>temporary</b> worker) and demographic variables was run. Immigration status {{is found to be}} a significant explanatory variable for it determines the migrant's family location. Temporary workers tend to send proportionately higher income to the families they have left behind.

40|$|Introduction: Insects as {{the largest}} {{category}} of arthropods include numerous groups and families {{that the most important}} of them belong to order Diptera, family Culicidae. Because of feeding on the human's blood, a number of species of this family have been known as responsible for the transmission of pathogens for many diseases such as malaria, filariasis, encephalitis, yellow fever and dengue fever in the world. Given that no research has been conducted to determine the fauna of existing mosquitoes in the city of Poldokhtar, Lorestan Province, the present study aimed to exactly determine the mosquitoes' fauna in this city to perform appropriate prevention measures. Methods: In this faunistic and cross-sectional descriptive study, four urban areas and four rural areas in four geographic directions in the city of Poldokhtar were determined. In each urban area, two places and in each designated rural area, four places including two human places and two animal places were selected. From the early of April 2015 to the early of January 2016, larvae, pupae and adult mosquitoes of the Culicidae family were collected. Sampling methods for larvae, pupae and mature were ladling, night catch, total and hand catch with an aspirator. Characteristics including the name of the collector, date of collection, code related to habitat, habitat <b>status</b> (<b>permanent</b> or <b>temporary),</b> type of vegetation cover, type of substrate, and the situation of sunlight were recorded in the related form. The samples were identified by resources and valid identification keys. The data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 19. Results: Totally, 5392 mosquito adults of the Culicidae family including 1818 mosquito adults and 3574 larvae in designated areas in the city as well as four rural areas were collected. The three genera Anopheles (21. 9...|$|R
5000|$|Not every worker {{enjoys the}} {{benefits}} of such employment practices and work environments. Although 64% of households in 1985 depended on wages or salaries {{for most of their}} income, most of these workers were employed by small and medium-sized firms that could not afford the benefits or achieve the successes of the large companies, despite the best intentions of owners. Even in the large corporations, distinctions between <b>permanent</b> and <b>temporary</b> employees made many workers, often women, ineligible for benefits and promotions. These workers were also the first to be laid off in difficult business conditions. Japan scholar Dorinne K. Kondo compares the <b>status</b> of <b>permanent</b> and <b>temporary</b> workers with Bachnik's distinctions between <b>permanent</b> and <b>temporary</b> members of an [...] "ie" [...] (家, see Japanese family), creating degrees of inside and outside within a firm. Traditions of entrepreneurship and of inheritance of the means of livelihood continued among merchants, artisans, farmers, and fishermen, still nearly 20% of the work force in 1985. These workers gave up security for autonomy and, when economically necessary, supplemented household income with wage employment. Traditionally, such businesses use unpaid family labor, but wives or even husbands are likely to go off to work in factories or offices and leave spouses or retired parents to work the farm or mind the shop. On the one hand, policies of decentralization provide factory jobs locally for families that farm part-time; on the other hand, unemployment created by deindustrialization affects rural as well as urban workers. Whereas unemployment is low in Japan compared with other industrialized nations (less than 3% through the late 1980s), an estimated 400,000 day laborers share none of the security or affluence enjoyed by those employees with lifetime-employment benefits.|$|R

The difference among <b>permanent</b> and <b>temporary</b> migrant behavior indicated that decision-making does matter in the process of <b>permanent</b> and <b>temporary</b> migration.|$|R
