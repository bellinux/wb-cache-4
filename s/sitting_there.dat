5|$|I {{remember}} {{being in the}} back part of the studio, and we were <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> {{late at night and}} writing. I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a particular sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, and we came up with the basis for the song. I put a little drum groove down {{and it was one of}} the easier songs to write with her.|$|E
5|$|I was <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> in {{the theater}} at the back, showing it to people for the first time. I mean, {{it was like a}} puddle of sweat around my feet. It was like, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E

5|$|It was {{possible}} {{to look into the}} back yard from the road...the corpses in British uniform were lying in the yard near the buildings. They were lying in such a position that one can assume they were killed by machine-gun bursts. It struck me at once that the dead soldiers were not wearing helmets, nor did they have any equipment on them...I took pictures of the dead bodies, and the whole farm. At Thum's request these were to be placed at the disposal of the division...I believe I was already <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> in the vehicle when Thum...told me that in the field which he had returned the equipment...the shot British soldiers were lying in a heap, from which he had {{come to the conclusion that}} a summary trial had taken place.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand, {{still part}} of the colony of New South Wales, became a {{separate}} Colony of New Zealand on 1 July 1841. The colony gained a representative government in 1852 and the first Parliament met in 1854. In 1856 the colony effectively became self-governing, gaining responsibility over all domestic matters other than native policy. (Control over native policy was granted in the mid-1860s.) Following concerns that the South Island might form a separate colony, premier Alfred Domett moved a resolution to transfer the capital from Auckland to a locality near the Cook Strait. Wellington was chosen for its central location, with Parliament officially <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> {{for the first time}} in 1865. As immigrant numbers increased, conflicts over land led to the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s and 1870s, resulting in the loss and confiscation of much Māori land.|$|E
25|$|The Strangers' Bar {{is one of}} the {{numerous}} bars, cafeterias and restaurants in the Palace of Westminster, with differing rules regarding who is allowed to use their facilities; many of them never close while the House is <b>sitting.</b> <b>There</b> is also a gymnasium, and even a hair salon; and a rifle range. Parliament also has two souvenir shops, where items on sale range from House of Commons key-rings and china to House of Commons Champagne.|$|E

25|$|The station's {{terminal}} layout has posed some unique problems {{ever since}} the late 20th century, since all trains have to change directions and reverse {{out of the station}} to continue on to their destination. This causes long turn-around times and places the passengers in the opposite direction of where they had been <b>sitting.</b> <b>There</b> have been several attempts to change this. The last project, called Frankfurt 21, was to put the whole station underground, connect it with tunnels also to the east, and so avoid the disadvantages of the terminal layout. This would be financed by selling the air rights over the area now used for tracks as building ground for skyscraper, but this soon proved unrealistic, and the project was abandoned.|$|E
500|$|Among the Canadians, {{only two}} players were not suspended: goalie Jimmy Waite and forward Pierre Turgeon. [...] Waite {{felt he could}} not risk being ejected for {{fighting}} under {{the belief that the}} game would resume, and that the Canadian backup goaltender, Shawn Simpson, was injured. [...] Steve Nemeth would later apply for early reinstatement arguing that he was not fighting, but trying to help break the players apart. [...] Many of their teammates never forgave Turgeon for failing to defend his teammates. In the words of Everett Sanipass: [...] "I'm looking for someone to help (Stéphane) Roy out and I look over at the bench. [...] There's this dog Turgeon, just <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> with his head down. He wouldn't get his ass off the bench ... just <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> when everyone's off the Soviet bench and at least one of our guys is in real trouble getting double-teamed." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Rothchild, {{producer}} of The Doors' first five albums, recalled the elation that an American musician {{had made a}} record that successfully challenged {{the primacy of the}} British Invasion groups. He said, [...] "What I realized when I was <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> is that one of US—one of the so-called Village hipsters—was making music that could compete with THEM—the Beatles, and the Stones, and the Dave Clark Five—without sacrificing any of the integrity of folk music or the power of rock'n'roll." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{reasoned}} that [...] "part of {{the pleasure of}} movie-going is pure spectacle—of just <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> and looking at great stuff and knowing it looks terrific. There wasn't much Schumacher could have done with the story or the music he was handed, but in the areas over which he held sway, he has triumphed." [...] In contrasting between {{the popularity of the}} Broadway musical, Michael Dequina of Film Threat magazine explained that [...] "it conjures up this unexplainable spell that leaves audiences sad, sentimental, swooning, smiling—in some way transported and moved. Now, in Schumacher's film, that spell lives on." ...|$|E
500|$|With his {{increasing}} {{exposure to}} technology and science fiction, Idol decided to base his upcoming album on the cyberpunk genre, and quickly set about educating himself in Cyberdelic counter culture. Idol saw {{the convergence of}} affordable technology with the music industry and anticipated its impact on a new era for DIY punk music. [...] "It's 1993," [...] Idol said during a New York Times interview. [...] "I better wake up {{and be part of}} it. I'm <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> a 1977 punk watching Courtney Love talk about punk, watching Nirvana talk about punk, and this is my reply." ...|$|E
500|$|Bakshi had {{originally}} intended to cast Drew Barrymore and Brad Pitt in the film's leading roles. Brad Pitt was cast as Frank Harris instead, with Gabriel Byrne as Deebs and Kim Basinger as Holli. The film's voice cast includes Maurice LaMarche, Charlie Adler and Candi Milo. According to Bakshi, Basinger had attempted to rewrite the film halfway into its production because she [...] "thought {{it would be great}} [...] if {{she would be able to}} show this picture in hospitals to sick children [...] I said, 'Kim, I think that's wonderful, but you've got the wrong guy to do that with.'

60|$|In consequence, {{in a great}} measure, of Henrietta's {{efficient}} help, the king's affairs greatly improved, and, for a time, {{it seemed}} as if he would gain an ultimate and final victory over his enemies, and recover his lost dominion. He advanced to Oxford, and made his head quarters there, and commenced the preparations for once more getting possession of the palaces and fortresses of London. He called together a Parliament at Oxford; some members came, and were regularly organized in the two houses of Lords and Commons, while the rest remained at London and continued their <b>sittings</b> <b>there.</b> Thus there were two governments, two Parliaments, and two capitals in England, and the whole realm was rent and distracted by the respective claims of these contending powers over the allegiance of the subjects and the government of the realm.|$|R

In an interview with MTV News, Tyler confessed that she felt [...] "scared and vulnerable" [...] while filming Jersey Girl, adding [...] "I was so used to those {{other elements of the}} character [...] On The Lord of the Rings, a lot of things were done in post-production, whereas this was really just about me and Ben <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> just shooting off dialogue."

500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He {{described}} holding hands with her: [...] "I was, like, in heaven. It {{was the most}} magical thing. It was better than kissing her, {{it was better than}} anything." [...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed. But that means nothing to kids today. She grew up too fast. She wasn't into innocence, and I love that.|$|E
500|$|... "Eat, Pray, Queef" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker. It first aired on April 1, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. Although Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone acknowledged it was a particularly juvenile episode, Parker said it was his favorite show of the season to produce. He said, [...] "I seriously never laughed as hard doing retakes, just going shot-by-shot, <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> in the editing room laughing." [...] During the writing process, the female producers and employees with the show found the script largely unfunny, disgusting and offensive. They reportedly claimed vaginal flatulence would not bloom into a proud women's movement {{as it did in the}} episode, but Parker and Stone insisted that was what made the concept even funnier.|$|E

500|$|Responders and paramedics {{from a local}} New Haven fire {{department}} arrived at the hotel, and paramedic Daniel Dolphin stated that a woman met him and his crewmember outside the hotel and escorted them inside. [...] "People were laughing. They were crying. My first impression {{was that it was}} a comedy show and the guy who was lying on the stage was faking it," [...] said Dolphin in a statement to the New Haven Journal-Courier. Dolphin's ambulance partner, Tony Deluise of the New Haven Ambulance Company, said to the Boston Phoenix that he witnessed odd behavior while responding to Slee: [...] "They were all in seats, just <b>sitting</b> <b>there</b> and facing the stage, like an audience. Most were quiet; a few you could hear crying, a few laughing." ...|$|E

Around this time McMahan and Walford began writing together for the band's next record, creating six new songs which the band practiced throughout the summer of 1990. Slint entered River North Records in August 1990 to record Spiderland. At that time there were no vocals or lyrics prepared for the album, so the band wrote them while in the studio. The album's producer, Brian Paulson, {{was known for his}} [...] "live" [...] recording style in the studio, with minimal takes. Paulson recalled [...] "It was weird while I was doing [...] because I remember <b>sitting</b> <b>there,</b> and I just knew there was something about it. I've never heard anything like this.
