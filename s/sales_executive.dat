40|$|Summary Companies {{that rely}} on Management By Objectives systems {{typically}} encounter two types of difficulty: objectives may be too difficult to attain, especially when there is top-down pressure; and reference to objectives defined {{at the start of}} the year may be a questionable basis for year-end performance evaluation when managers' results have been affected by unforeseen events. Our purpose is to examine how MBO is used when managers simultaneously face high pressure to achieve objectives and high environmental uncertainty. Based on a study of fourteen <b>sales</b> <b>executives,</b> this article identifies two types of organizational adjustments brought into play by executives to cope with this type of situation: a more collective management approach to ensure achievement of overall corporate objectives, and development of close interpersonal relationships that build mutual trust between <b>sales</b> <b>executives</b> and their staff. <b>Sales</b> <b>executives</b> <b>Sales</b> quotas Sales management Shareholder pressure Management by objectives Risk sharing Leadership...|$|R
5|$|In {{the race}} for city commissioners, each party nominates two {{candidates}} and the top three are elected. The office was a county office, a holdover from the time before consolidation of the townships in Philadelphia County into one city. The most important of the remaining duties of the commissioners in Philadelphia was {{the conduct of the}} city's elections; they also had responsibility for regulating weights and measures. As in the other races, the Democrats triumphed, electing both Maurice S. Osser and Thomas P. McHenry. McHenry was an incumbent who had served as commissioner since 1945, while Osser was new to the office, having previously worked as a lawyer and {{as the leader of the}} 16th ward. The Republican spot on the county commission went to Walter I. Davidson, a <b>sales</b> <b>executive.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although {{originally}} {{conceived as}} {{the first part of}} a franchise aimed specifically at Western markets, Shadow of Rome did not sell well in either North America or Europe (entering the UK PlayStation 2 charts at #5), and ultimately, Capcom considered it a failure.

During his fifteen-year career he produced over 85 films, most of them between 1934 and 1941 {{while he was at}} RKO Studios. Prior to his production career, Marcus worked for FBO and then RKO as a <b>sales</b> <b>executive,</b> reaching the level of vice president in both organizations. At RKO, he was head of production of the studio's b-films during the late 1930s {{and the beginning of the}} 1940s.

25|$|WMUR was {{the first}} {{television}} station {{in the country to}} develop a significant Internet presence beginning in 1996. It {{was the first}} television station to hire a full-time employee dedicated to streaming its newscast live and archived online for later viewing. It was also the first television station to use the Internet to supplement its broadcast news by posting additional information online like the Megan's Law list. After posting a 3D virtual tour of its TV studio facilities online it briefly became the most visited attraction online in the world. Beginning in 1998 the station made significant financial, technical and staff investments into its internet strategy. This included 24-hour original news segments, weather coverage from a professional meteorologist and <b>Sales</b> <b>Executive</b> dedicated to TV and online advertising. In 2000 WMUR, CNN and WMUR.COM simulcasted their New Hampshire Primary Debates held at the TV station. This was the first widely promoted and executed worldwide live streaming video event.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} part of the decade, sales were strong, thanks in no small part to the company's history of {{building}} small cars, which came into vogue in 1961. In both 1960 and 1961, Ramblers ranked in third place among domestic automobile sales, up from third on the strength of small-car sales, even in the face of a lot of new competition. Romney's strategic focus was very successful as reflected in the firm's healthy profits year after year. The company became completely debt-free. The financial success allowed the company to reach an agreement on August 26, 1961 with the United Auto Workers for a profit sharing plan that was new in the automobile industry. Its new three-year labor contract also included generous annual improvement pay increases, as well as automatic cost-of-living raises. However, in 1962, Romney resigned to run for Governor of Michigan. His replacement was Roy Abernethy, AMC's successful <b>sales</b> <b>executive.</b>|$|E

Upon its release, the song became a hit and was Motown's fastest-selling single at the time, peaking at number 1 on the Hot Soul Singles Chart, and peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Gordy {{was stunned by the}} news and drove to Gaye's home to discuss him making a complete album, stating Gaye could do what he wanted with his music if he finished the record within 30 days before the end of March and thus effectively giving him the right to produce his own albums. Gaye returned to Hitsville to record the rest of What's Going On, which took a mere ten business days between March 1 and March 10. The album's rhythm tracks and sound overdubs were recorded at Hitsville, or Studio A, while the strings, horns, lead and background vocals were recorded at Golden World, or Studio B.|$|E

The study made use of triangulation research designs (exploratory and questionnaire). A purposive sampling method was adopted to sample 50 <b>sales</b> <b>executives</b> (past and present workers) from Fidelity Bank, Eco Bank and Standard Chartered Bank. The value of Cronbach’s Alpha was calculated on employee loyalty 0. 804, engagement 0. 707 and employee performance 0. 839 to determine {{the reliability and validity}} level of the both independent and dependent variables by using the statistical package for social science, version 20. The findings revealed that there are significant linear correlations among employee loyalty, engagement and performance.
