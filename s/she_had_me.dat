25|$|While Duke University’s {{reputation}} grew as {{a national}} educational institution, its attitudes towards black workers remained unchanged. The same year the Duke Employees Benevolent Society was established in 1965, Duke revealed a new $200 million plan to promote Duke’s status as a top national university. The funds were used to advance the renovation of new libraries, science research labs, and more modern facilities. Despite Duke University’s reputation as an institution for higher education and its growing expertise in preparing its students for the professional society, the working environments and attitudes towards black, blue-collar workers had not changed. Workers were not given health insurance, received little pay, had inconsistent and demanding schedules, often working ten to twelve days without a day off, and were treated unprofessionally. One nurse’s maid, Helen Johnstone, recalled being treated like a servant: “When I was a nurse’s maid, our second head nurse, Joan Ashley, she used to run me everywhere—uptown to get the immunizations and {{to put them in}} my refrigerator. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> run to the library to return her books for her on time.” It was not unusual for black workers to be treated this way, especially as a result of unclear job descriptions that gave those with higher power control over the tasks assigned to black workers.|$|E
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN. Just so. Thats where <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>me.</b> I shouldn't have {{believed}} her a bit if she'd {{turned her back}} to me.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> {{with the}} first shot. I couldn't think of {{anything}} to say. I couldn't tell her that Rocky was down in the country, watching worms.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dear father!' cried Blockhead-Hans, 'I {{must have}} a horse too. What a desire for {{marriage}} <b>has</b> seized <b>me!</b> If <b>she</b> will <b>have</b> <b>me,</b> <b>she</b> WILL <b>have</b> <b>me,</b> and if <b>she</b> won't <b>have</b> <b>me,</b> I will <b>have</b> her.' ...|$|R
60|$|Oakhurst. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> gone,--gone! But hear <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> deceived you as <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> <b>has</b> gone,--gone {{with her}} first husband, Henry Pritchard.|$|R
6000|$|I {{knew now}} why <b>she</b> <b>had</b> looked guilty at my appearance, what {{had brought her}} out that afternoon, why <b>she</b> <b>had</b> hurried <b>me</b> in, {{the nature of the}} [...] "book" [...] <b>she</b> <b>had</b> run back to fetch, the reason why <b>she</b> <b>had</b> wanted <b>me</b> to go back by the high-road, and why <b>she</b> <b>had</b> pitied <b>me.</b> It was all in the instant clear to me.|$|R
6000|$|She went out. She {{returned}} presently with a dressmaker. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> measured. [...] "I mean," [...] said she, [...] "to {{follow my}} own taste, {{and to have}} my own way in this little matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is a lie!" [...] cried Gartok, {{springing}} up and looking fierce. [...] "Old Uleeta is, {{as you all}} know, my mother. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> to hunt for her when father was killed, and she has me still." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, I saw her. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> taken {{upstairs to}} her room. She asked if I was your servant, and when I said yes, {{she told me}} that she hoped I would take great care of you. I said that was my duty.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{has good}} looks, certainly. I'll own to that. As for her romance and good-feeling, that I leave to you. I think <b>she</b> <b>has</b> treated you no more cruelly, {{as you call}} it, than <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>me,</b> come to that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hiram Yorke, I {{certainly}} believed <b>she</b> loved <b>me.</b> I <b>have</b> seen her eyes sparkle radiantly when <b>she</b> <b>has</b> found <b>me</b> {{out in a}} crowd; <b>she</b> <b>has</b> flushed up crimson when <b>she</b> <b>has</b> offered <b>me</b> her hand, and said, 'How do you do, Mr. Moore?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{have seemed}} lukewarm {{sometimes}} of late," [...] Brott said, [...] "there is the cause. She is an aristocrat, and my politics are hateful to her. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> told <b>me</b> so seriously, playfully, angrily. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> let <b>me</b> {{feel it in}} a hundred ways. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> drawn <b>me</b> into discussions and shown the utmost horror of my views. I have cared for her all my life, and she knows it. And I think, Grahame, that lately <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been trying constantly, persistently, to tone down my opinions. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> let <b>me</b> understand {{that they are a}} bar between us. And it is a horrible confession, Grahame, but I believe that I was wavering. This invitation from Letheringham seemed such a wonderful opportunity for compromise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove!" [...] {{he said a}} day later, [...] "Mrs. Everleigh's {{an awfully}} fine woman, isn't she? I was telling her about my having been in the oil {{business}} for a little while, and she thinks that I'd really be awfully good in money things. She said she wished <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> to manage her money for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{she asked}} me if this {{narrative}} of yours was a strongly accentuated love-story. Here <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> at a disadvantage, for I have not heard it; but I assured her that, knowing the scope and purpose of your work, I did not believe that you would accentuate any portion of it more than was absolutely necessary.|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely! I {{remember}} now. My wife lugged {{me to see}} her perform one night. It {{all comes}} back to me. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> wedged in an orchestra-stall before I knew what I was up against, {{and then it was}} too late. I remember reading in some journal or other that she had a pet snake, given her by some Russian prince or other, what?" ...|$|E
60|$|I was disgusted {{to think}} that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> caught <b>me</b> napping, and that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been near <b>me</b> in the House and I had not known it, but I said nothing of this.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I am very {{grateful}} to your mother for what <b>she</b> <b>has</b> done for <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> not only cured my mother of cancer--she <b>has</b> cured <b>me</b> of despair. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> taught <b>me</b> to believe again in {{the mystery of the}} world." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{woodlands}} I {{have known}} her, [...] When boughs were mourning loud, In the rain-reek <b>she</b> <b>has</b> shown her [...] Wild-haired and watery-browed. And {{once or twice}} <b>she</b> <b>has</b> cast <b>me</b> [...] As she pomped along the street Court-clad, ere quite <b>she</b> <b>had</b> passed <b>me,</b> [...] A glance from her chariot-seat.|$|R
60|$|I wished Joan {{could have}} seen his conduct, but she was busy {{thinking}} what she would do. Then <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> fetch the knight Jean de Metz, and in a minute he was off for La Hire's quarters with orders for him and the Lord de Villars and Florent d'Illiers to report to her at five o'clock next morning with five hundred picked men well mounted. The histories say half past four, {{but it is not}} true, I heard the order given.|$|E
6000|$|TARLETON. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> there, {{though she}} doesnt know it, poor {{innocent}} lamb! Public scandal exaggerates enormously, of course; but moralize as you will, superabundant vitality {{is a physical}} fact that cant be talked away. [He sits down between the writing table and the sideboard]. Difficult question this, of bringing up children. Between ourselves, it has beaten me. I never was so surprised in my life as when I came to know Johnny {{as a man of}} business and found out what he was really like. How did you manage with your sons? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I never could," [...] {{answered}} the dejected parasite. [...] "There was my Lord Castle-Cuddy--we were hand and glove: I rode his horses, borrowed money both {{for him and}} from him, trained his hawks, and {{taught him how to}} lay his bets; and when he took a fancy of marrying, I married him to Katie Glegg, whom I thought myself as sure of as man could be of woman. Egad, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> out of the house, as if I had run on wheels, within the first fortnight!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They each left a girl. I admit. But Jane {{has never}} favored them {{any more than}} <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>me.</b> And this invitation, coming; when Jane is {{practically}} on her death bed, is a warrant that Beth will get the money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What does {{it matter}} being odd? You could learn the truth at any rate. If she does not care for any one else why shouldn't <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>me?</b> I could make her a baronet's wife,--that is, some day when the governor--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Marcia {{is a fine}} woman," [...] she said, [...] "and I {{love her}} ever so much, but you know <b>she</b> <b>has</b> caused <b>me</b> {{a great deal of}} pain; that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> {{actually}} made <b>me</b> cry when I was in bed at night." ...|$|R
60|$|While I {{had been}} away from home lately, Traddles had called twice or thrice. Finding Peggotty within, and being {{informed}} by Peggotty (who always volunteered that information to whomsoever would receive it), that she was my old nurse, he had established a good-humoured acquaintance with her, and had stayed {{to have a little}} chat with her about me. So Peggotty said; but I am afraid the chat was all on her own side, and of immoderate length, as she was very difficult indeed to stop, God bless her! when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> for her theme.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{began to}} tremble and blush; and then I told her what you, Mr. Sam, had told {{me the other day}} about your money matters; and no sooner did she hear it than she sprung to her bonnet, and said, 'Come, come:' and in five minutes <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> by the arm, and we walked {{together}} to Grosvenor Square. The air did her no harm, Mr. Sam, and during the whole of the walk she never cried but once, and then it was at seeing a nursery-maid in the Square.|$|E
6000|$|She {{knew that}} she had the more {{substance}} of the two--you needn't try any cheap jokes, I am not talking of their weights. She was just a little anxious while he was away, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> who, being a tried confidant, took the liberty to whisper frequently [...] "The sooner the better." [...] But there was a peculiar vein of obstinacy in Miss Freya, and her reason for delay was characteristic. [...] "Not before my twenty-first birthday; so that there shall be no mistake in people's minds as to me being old enough to know what I am doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>she</b> <b>has</b> {{never made}} <b>me</b> cry," [...] Ah Kim disclaimed hastily. [...] "Never, {{from the time}} I was a little boy, <b>has</b> <b>she</b> made <b>me</b> cry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> {{no doubt}} <b>she</b> {{will tell you}} all. But do not suppose, Mrs. Fenwick, that I am not thankful. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> behaved very well,--and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> {{accepted}} <b>me.</b> <b>She</b> <b>has</b> explained to <b>me</b> in what way her acceptance has been given, and I have submitted to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Father, it is Mother's doing. It {{has been}} her plan, {{ever since she}} heard that you were wrecked, that we should come out here to find you, and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> {{regularly}} trained for it. I had masters for fencing and gymnastics, we always talked Hindustani when we were together, and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> encouraged <b>me</b> to fight with other boys, so that I should get strong and quick." ...|$|R
60|$|We examined, {{with other}} tourists, at a {{shilling}} apiece historic mansions with endless drawing-rooms, halls, libraries, galleries filled with family portraits; elaborate, formal bedrooms where famous sovereigns had slept, all roped off and carpeted with canvas strips {{to protect the}} floors. Through mullioned windows we caught glimpses of gardens and geometrical parterres, lakes, fountains, statuary, fantastic topiary and distant stretches of park. Maude sighed with admiration, but did not covet. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>me.</b> But I was often uncomfortable, resenting the vulgar, gaping tourists with whom we were herded and the easy familiarity of the guides. These did not trouble Maude, who often annoyed me by asking naive questions herself. I would nudge her.|$|E
60|$|I waited {{her coming}} stiffly, in great {{depression}} of spirits, {{and noted that}} her first attentions were for David, who, somewhat shabbily, gave her {{the end of a}} smile which had been begun for me. It seemed to relieve her, for what one may call the wild maternal look left her face, and trying to check little gasps of breath, the result of unseemly running, she signed to her confederates to remain in the background, and turned curious eyes on me. Had she spoken as she approached, I am sure her words would have been as flushed as her face, but now her mouth puckered as David's does before he sets forth upon his smile, and I saw that she thought <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> in a parley at last.|$|E
6000|$|... "There was a time, years ago," [...] {{she began}} in a low voice, [...] "when you were very rich and your sister Violet, my mother, was very poor. Her health was bad, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> to care for, while my father was very ill with a fever. She was proud, too, and for herself {{she would never have}} begged a penny of anyone; but for my sake she asked her rich sister to loan her a little money to tide her over her period of want. What did you do, Jane Merrick, you who lived in a {{beautiful}} mansion, and had more money than you could use? You insulted her, telling her she belonged to a family of beggars, and that none of them could wheedle your money away from you!" ...|$|E
60|$|But as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> taken <b>me</b> {{in before}} when others <b>had</b> cast <b>me</b> out, so she now proved the friend in need.|$|R
6000|$|He {{no longer}} {{thought of her}} as his victim--as {{something}} to be ruthlessly enjoyed--he trembled before her, big and brave and relentless {{as he was in}} the world of men. [...] "What has come over me?" [...] he asked himself. [...] "Sure <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>me</b> on me knees--the witch. Me mind is filled with her." ...|$|R
60|$|Tim. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> persuaded <b>me</b> so damnably, that I {{begin to}} think she's my {{mistress}} indeed.|$|R
