40|$|Abstract. The {{relationship}} among the thermal parameters of <b>supercharging</b> system of {{internal combustion engine}} is very complicated. They affect and constrain each other. It is comparatively difficult to find out their changing rules and interactions, let alone the special <b>supercharging</b> system of natural gas engine. This paper is aimed to calculate and find out the internal connections among all parameters by rationally selecting parameters collected from experiences and establishing mathematical model for the <b>supercharging</b> thermal parameters of natural gas engine based on diesel engine’s <b>supercharging</b> estimation method, so as to provide theoretical basis for matching the <b>supercharging</b> system. 1. Overview The independently developed natural gas engines (NGE) in China are mostly transformed from diesel engines. Due to the change of such factors as air-fuel ratio, air inflow method and excess air coefficient, the NGE’s flow of combination gas is obviously reduced; the usable exhaust energy is decreased; the <b>supercharging</b> degree and <b>supercharge</b> pressure are naturally lowered; and meanwhile, excessive thermal load problem also comes along comparing with diesel engine under the same working condition. Therefore, the major <b>supercharging</b> thermal parameters of the engin...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} Bond stories Fleming gave Bond a battleship-grey Bentley 4½ Litre with an Amherst Villiers <b>supercharger.</b> After Bond's car was written off by Hugo Drax in Moonraker, Fleming gave Bond a Mark II Continental Bentley, {{which he used}} in the {{remaining}} books of the series. During Goldfinger, Bond was issued with an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device, which he used to track Goldfinger across France. Bond returned to his Bentley for the subsequent novels.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} version to {{incorporate}} changes brought about through experience in operational service was the XX, {{which was designed}} to run on 100 octane fuel. This fuel allowed higher manifold pressures, which were achieved by increasing the boost from the centrifugal <b>supercharger.</b> The Merlin XX also utilised the two-speed superchargers designed by Rolls-Royce, resulting in increased power at higher altitudes than previous versions. Another improvement, introduced with the Merlin X, was the use of a 70%–30% water-glycol coolant mix rather than the 100% glycol of the earlier versions. This substantially improved engine life and reliability, removed the fire hazard of the flammable ethylene glycol, and reduced the oil leaks that had been a problem with the early Merlin I, II and III series.|$|E

50|$|<b>Supercharge,</b> {{denoted by}} the symbol Q, is an {{operator}} which transforms bosons into fermions, and vice versa.

40|$|We {{systematically}} analyze Riemannian manifolds M that admit rigid supersymmetry, {{focusing on}} four-dimensional N= 1 theories with a U(1) _R symmetry. We find that M admits a single <b>supercharge,</b> if {{and only if}} it is a Hermitian manifold. The <b>supercharge</b> transforms as a scalar on M. We then consider the restrictions imposed by the presence of additional <b>supercharges.</b> Two <b>supercharges</b> of opposite R-charge exist on certain fibrations of a two-torus over a Riemann surface. Upon dimensional reduction, these give rise to an interesting class of supersymmetric geometries in three dimensions. We further show that compact manifolds admitting two <b>supercharges</b> of equal R-charge must be hyperhermitian. Finally, four <b>supercharges</b> imply that M is locally isometric to M_ 3 x R, where M_ 3 is a maximally symmetric space. Comment: 39 pages; minor change...|$|R
5|$|The {{pre-production}} Griffon I {{shared the}} R engine's bore and stroke, but was otherwise {{a completely new}} design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although this single engine was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. A {{significant difference between the}} R and the production Griffon was the re-location of the camshaft and <b>supercharger</b> drives {{to the front of the}} engine to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved to the front of the engine.|$|E

These albums featured rapping by Robb Flynn and simpler guitar riffs, but retaining part of their aggressive sound. This change in direction resulted in criticism from many fans because of the popularity of nu metal at the time.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war the Merlin I, II and III ran on the then {{standard}} 87 octane aviation spirit and could generate just over 1,000 horsepower (750kW) from its 27-litre (1,650-cuin) displacement: the maximum boost pressure at which the engine could be run using 87 octane fuel was +6 pounds per square inch (141kPa; 1.44atm). However, as early as 1938, at the 16th Paris Air Show, Rolls-Royce displayed two versions of the Merlin rated to use 100 octane fuel. The Merlin R.M.2M was capable of 1,265 horsepower (943kW) at 7,870 feet (2,400m), 1,285 horsepower (958kW) at 9,180 feet (2,800m) and 1,320 horsepower (984kW) on take-off; while a Merlin X with a two-speed <b>supercharger</b> in high gear generated 1,150 horsepower (857kW) at 15,400 feet (4,700m) and 1,160 horsepower (865kW) at 16,730 feet (5,100m).|$|E
5|$|Mercedes-Benz {{returned}} to Grand Prix racing {{at the start}} of the 1937 season with a new car. The W125 was a vast improvement on its predecessor, its supercharged eight cylinder 5.6-litre engine delivered significantly more power than the W25: 650 brake horsepower compared to 500. The first major race of 1937 was the Avusrennen where 300,000people turned out to see the cars race on the newly re-constructed track. In order to keep speeds consistently high, the north curve was turned into a steeply banked turn, apparently at the suggestion of Adolf Hitler. Driving a streamlined Mercedes-Benz, Caracciola won his heat against Rosemeyer, averaging around , although a transmission failure forced him to retire in the final. Following the AVUS race, Caracciola, along with Rosemeyer, Nuvolari and Mercedes' new driver, Richard Seaman, went to race in the revived Vanderbilt Cup in America, and in doing so missed the Belgian Grand Prix, which took place six days later. Caracciola led until lap22, when he retired with a broken <b>supercharger.</b>|$|E
5|$|Toyota Australia {{planned to}} sell 50 to 70 TRD Aurion units per month with the {{majority}} of the sales coming from Australia. However, the project was unsuccessful, and as of 31 March 2009, TRD Australia halted production of the Aurion TRD (and TRD Hilux), and the division was shut down. When available, the range comprised two variants, the 3500S and 3500SL. The former features performance mufflers, 19-inch alloy wheels, red alcantara leather seats with black alcantara fabric bolsters and other high-performance upgrades. The range-topping 3500SL adds clearance and reverse parking sensors, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, a colour-coded transmission selection lever, and an eight-way adjustable driver's seat. Furthermore, the SL gains an aluminium rear bumper reinforcement addition, and is the first production car in the world to use the Eaton twin-vortices <b>supercharger.</b> This substantially reduces engine noise while bringing gains to power and torque.|$|E
