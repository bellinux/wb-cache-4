The flight from Cape Town to George was cleared for an instrument landing (ILS) approach and prevailing weather conditions {{at the time were}} overcast, with light rain. The landing appeared normal, however the aircraft did not vacate the runway but instead veered to the right and collided with approach lights before it burst through the airport's perimeter fence, coming to rest in a nose-down attitude on a public road. The aircraft was damaged beyond economical repair. Probable cause: The crew were unable to decelerate the aircraft to a safe stop due to ineffective braking of the aircraft on a wet runway surface, resulting in an overrun. Two months before the accident the runway was resurfaced with a <b>fog</b> <b>spray</b> sealant. The George area was experiencing a drought at the time and {{on the day of the}} accident it was the first rain they had received since the resurfacing.

Utilization of symmetry operators and search space restriction allows to detect and track vehicles even in pouring rain conditions. Furthermore, we present two applications of the above-described methods. Estimation of the strength of spray produced by preceding vehicles allows to draw conclusions about the overall visibility conditions and to adjust the intensity of one's own rear lights.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Grain dust, {{a health}} and safety risk, is {{generated}} whenever grain is loaded into or unloaded from hoppers and equipment. This research investigated airflow models and evaluated the particle dynamics from a high−pressure water−fog-ging system for potential dust control at a grain−receiving hopper. Experiments were performed in a test chamber, represent-ing a narrow section of a grain−receiving hopper. A 0. 2 mm (0. 008 in.) spray nozzle was used to produce a plume of fog directed across a free−falling grain column. More than 90 % of the fog droplets ranged from 10 to 40 m in diameter. Average droplet velocities in the plume cross−section were over 10 m s− 1 at 7. 6 cm from the nozzle. The air−velocity pressures at 7. 6 cm were parabolic in the radial direction, with maximum pressures over 275 Pa (1. 1 in. H 2 O). Airflow distributions, grain dust transport, and spray droplet trajectories within the test chamber were modeled in three dimensions using FLUENT, which is a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software program. Induced airflow from the <b>spray</b> <b>fog</b> caused recirculation {{of the air and}} dust particles in {{the lower part of the}} chamber. This recirculation pattern transported the dust from the grain pile back into the spray plume, where it mixed with the <b>spray</b> <b>fog.</b> The spray produced deposits on the surface of the grain pile ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 4 mg cm− 2 s− 1. However, when the grain pile filled the chamber and was positioned directly in the spray plume, the grain surface deposits were 1. 2 mg cm− 2 s− 1 at the grain peak. The spray produced deposits on the sidewall of the chamber. Sidewall spray deposits were 11 mg cm− 2 min− 1 in the middle of the test chamber and 1. 5 mg cm− 2 min− 1 near the outlet.

To achieve this, the particle size and composition of the smokes has to be adjusted. One of the approaches is using an aerosol of burning red phosphorus particles and aluminium coated glass fibers; the infrared emissions of such smoke curtains hides the weaker emissions of colder objects behind it, but the effect is only short-lived. Carbon (most often graphite) particles present in the smokes can also serve to absorb the beams of laser designators. Yet another possibility is a water <b>fog</b> <b>sprayed</b> around the vehicle; the presence of large droplets absorbs in infrared band and additionally serves as a countermeasure against radars in 94 GHz band.

50|$|The salt <b>spray</b> (or salt <b>fog)</b> test is a {{standardized}} and popular corrosion test method, used to check corrosion resistance {{of materials and}} surface coatings. Usually, the materials to be tested are metallic (although stone, ceramics, and polymers may also be tested) and finished with a surface coating which is intended to provide a degree of corrosion protection to the underlying metal. Salt spray testing is an accelerated corrosion test that produces a corrosive attack to coated samples in order to evaluate (mostly comparatively) the suitability of the coating {{for use as a}} protective finish. The appearance of corrosion products (rust or other oxides) is evaluated after a pre-determined period of time. Test duration depends on the corrosion resistance of the coating; generally, the more corrosion resistant the coating is, the longer the period of testing before the appearance of corrosion/ rust.The salt spray test {{is one of the most}} widespread and long established corrosion tests.
