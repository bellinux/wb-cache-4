500|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{referred}} to the film as [...] "Alternately gripping and laughable" [...] and that [...] "The scenes of gore and destruction are even more spectacular than Hong Kong's fog-shrouded skyline". Variety gave a positive review, describing the film as an [...] "extremely violent and superbly made actioner demonstrates the tight grasp that director John Woo has on the crime meller genre". Kathleen Maher of The Austin Chronicle praised the film stating that it [...] "defies all categorization but demands comparisons, if only to prove that there's never been anything like this before." [...] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote a positive review, describing the film as [...] "like eating popcorn, but it's not just any old brand; it's escape-velocity popcorn, popcorn with a <b>slurp</b> of rocket fuel... ideas overreach themselves with such a virile swagger that they border on comedy. With excess like this you can't help but laugh. This is a rush of a movie". The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a mixed review, stating that [...] "This violent Hong Kong thriller has more psychological depth than most of its kind, but ultimately seems like a pointless exercise in style".|$|E
2500|$|The rice or {{the soup}} is eaten {{by picking up}} the bowl with the left hand and using chopsticks (hashi) with the right, or vice versa if one is left-handed. Traditionally, chopsticks were held in the right hand and the bowl in the left. Japanese {{children}} were taught to distinguish left from right as [...] "the right hand holds the chopsticks, the left hand holds the bowl" [...] – but left-handed eating is acceptable today. Bowls may be lifted to the mouth, but should not be touched by the mouth except when drinking soup. The Japanese customarily <b>slurp</b> noodle soup dishes like ramen, udon, and soba. When slurping noodles quickly, the soup clings to the noodles, making the dish more flavourful.|$|E

40|$|<b>Slurping</b> (e. g., as when {{consuming}} a hot liquid such as soup) is {{a common}} practice {{in many parts of}} Asia. The practice is also encouraged amongst many professional wine and coffee tasters in order to help enhance the release of volatile aromas. Would <b>slurping</b> enhance flavour perception in western participants (regular consumers) too, and/or simply make them feel self-conscious? These were the key questions addressed in the present study. Specifically, we investigated the impact of <b>slurping</b> vs. sipping on ratings of flavour of hot soup samples served in either a bowl or mug at one of two temperatures. 207 participants (regular consumers) rated the flavour intensity of the soup, how much they liked it, and how self-consciousness they felt after having tasted each of the four samples. The results revealed that the soup was rated as having a significantly more intense flavour when it was <b>slurped</b> rather than sipped, though the participants also felt a little more self-conscious. Additionally, the participants preferred the soup when served from the mug rather than when served from the bowl (this difference was more pronounced for the hotter of the two soup samples), and they felt less self-conscious. Participants liked the soup significantly more when they sipped rather than when they slurped; this difference was more pronounced when participants sampled the soup from the bowl. These results therefore highlight the impact of plateware, temperature, and consumption style on our perception and enjoyment of food...|$|R
