50|$|Practical {{applications}} of the methods of geometrical acoustics {{can be found in}} very different areas of acoustics. For example, in architectural acoustics the rectilinear trajectories of <b>sound</b> <b>rays</b> make it possible to determine reverberation time in a very simple way. The operation of fathometers and hydrolocators is based on measurements of the time required for <b>sound</b> <b>rays</b> to travel to a reflecting object and back. The ray concept is used in designing sound focusing systems. Also, the approximate theory of sound propagation in inhomogeneous media (such as the ocean and the atmosphere) has been developed largely {{on the basis of the}} laws of geometrical acoustics.|$|R

50|$|Generally {{the models}} trace <b>sound</b> <b>ray</b> bundles and {{calculate}} spreading loss along with ray bundle divergence (or convergence) from refractive phenomena. Diffraction is usually addressed by establishing secondary emitters at any points of topographic or anthropomorphic “sharpness” (such {{as noise barriers}} or building surfaces). Meteorology can be addressed in a statistical manner allowing for actual wind rose and wind speed statistics (along with thermocline data).

40|$|In Room Acoustics, the {{quantity}} that fully describes the hall {{is a set}} of room impulse responses (RIRs), which are composed of the succession of arrivals (i. e., some <b>sound</b> <b>rays</b> which have undergone one or more reflections on their way from the source to the receiver). The mixing time is defined as the time it takes for initially adjacent <b>sound</b> <b>rays</b> to spread uniformly across the room. This paper proposes to investigate the temporal distribution of arrivals and the estimation of mixing time. A method based on maxima of correlations (Matching Pursuit) between the source impulse and the RIR allows to estimate in practice arrivals. This paper compares the cumulative distribution function of arrivals of experimental and synthesized RIRs (using a stochastic model). The mixing time is estimated when the arrival density becomes constant. The dependance of mixing time upon the distance source/receiver is investigated with measured and synthesized RIRs...|$|R

5000|$|Geometrical {{acoustics}} or ray acoustics is {{a branch}} of acoustics that studies propagation of sound {{on the basis of}} the concept of rays considered as lines along which the acoustic energy is transported. This concept is similar to the concept of geometrical optics, or ray optics, that studies light propagation in terms of rays. Geometrical acoustics is the approximate theory, which is valid in the limiting case of very small acoustic wavelengths, or very high frequencies. The principal task of geometrical acoustics is to determine the trajectories of <b>sound</b> <b>rays.</b> The rays have the simplest form in a homogeneous medium, where they are straight lines. If the acoustic parameters of the medium are functions of spatial coordinates, the ray trajectories become curvilinear, describing sound reflection, refraction, possible focusing, etc. The equations of geometric acoustics have essentially the same form as those of geometric optics. The same laws of reflection and refraction hold for <b>sound</b> <b>rays</b> as for light rays. Geometrical acoustics does not take into account such important wave effects as diffraction. However, it provides a very good approximation when the wavelength is very small compared to the characteristic dimensions of inhomogeneous inclusions through which the sound propagates.|$|R

50|$|In {{underwater}} acoustics, refraction is the bending or curving of a <b>sound</b> <b>ray</b> {{that results}} when the ray {{passes through a}} sound speed gradient from a region of one sound speed to a region of a different speed. The amount of ray bending {{is dependent on the}} amount of difference between sound speeds, that is, the variation in temperature, salinity, and pressure of the water.Similar acoustics effects are also found in the Earth's atmosphere. The phenomenon of refraction of sound in the atmosphere has been known for centuries; however, beginning in the early 1970s, widespread analysis of this effect came into vogue through the designing of urban highways and noise barriers to address the meteorological effects of bending of sound rays in the lower atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|In acoustics, {{the sound}} speed {{gradient}} is {{the rate of}} change of the speed of sound with distance, for example with depth in the ocean,or height in the Earth's atmosphere. A sound speed gradient leads to refraction of sound wavefronts in the direction of lower sound speed, causing the <b>sound</b> <b>rays</b> to follow a curved path. The radius of curvature of the sound path is inversely proportional to the gradient.|$|R

It is found that vertical oscillations of a sound-speed perturbation can affect rays in a resonant manner. Such resonances give rise to chaos in certain regions of phase space. It is shown that stability of steep rays, being observed in experiments, is connected with suppression of resonances in the case of small-scale vertical sound-speed oscillations...|$|E
