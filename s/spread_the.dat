40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>The</b> notion <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of {{a matrix}} was first {{introduced}} fifty years ago in algebra. In this article, we define <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of <b>the</b> shape operator by applying the same idea to submanifolds of Riemannian manifolds. We prove that <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of shape operator is a conformal invariant for any submanifold in a Riemannian manifold. Then, we prove that, for a compact submanifold of a Riemannian manifold, <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of <b>the</b> shape operator is bounded above by a geometric quantity proportional to the Willmore-Chen functional. For a complete non-compact submanifold, we establish a relationship between <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of <b>the</b> shape operator and the Willmore-Chen functional. In the last section, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a surface of rotation to have finite integral of <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of <b>the</b> shape operator...|$|R

5|$|A key {{assessment}} {{that is made}} after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see Staging), as {{this is the only}} cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has <b>spread.</b> <b>The</b> exact location of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age in itself is not an obstacle to surgery.|$|E
5|$|After Spike recovers {{and has a}} final {{talk with}} Rashid, he and Elektra are {{captured}} by Cherious Medical, who want to suppress all knowledge of the nanomachines' existence. The two escape from Cherious Medical, grabbing the newly produced vaccine on the way. In turn, Faye escapes after Vincent goes to trigger {{an attack on the}} city that will eventually kill everyone on Mars. After the group reunites, it is determined that Vincent will <b>spread</b> <b>the</b> nanomachines by exploding the giant jack-o'-lantern balloons used in the Halloween parade: Jet has a troop of old aircraft <b>spread</b> <b>the</b> antibodies over the city while Faye heads for the weather control center and causes it to rain on the city, aiding the spread of the vaccine. Spike and Elektra separately head to confront Vincent. Spike arrives first and the two battle to a standstill, then the nanomachines are released and Spike is temporarily weakened by them. As Vincent prepares to kill him, Elektra arrives and shoots Vincent. Having wanted to die since Titan, Vincent does not defend himself and thanks Elektra for their time together before dying.|$|E

5|$|After {{his death}} from cancer in 1941 his manuscripts were curated by his {{linguist}} friends who also worked to <b>spread</b> <b>the</b> influence of Whorf's {{ideas on the}} relation between language, culture and cognition. Many of his works were published posthumously in the first decades after his death. In the 1960s Whorf's views fell out of favor and he {{became the subject of}} harsh criticisms by scholars who considered language structure to primarily reflect cognitive universals rather than cultural differences. Critics argued that Whorf's ideas were untestable and poorly formulated and that they were based on badly analyzed or misunderstood data.|$|E

5|$|As a countermeasure, {{cultures}} of the nematode Deladenus siricidicola {{have been used as}} biological control to protect trees since the 1980s. This parasite feeds on the mycelia of A.areolatum and is therefore a food competitor of wood wasp larvae. Where S.noctilio larvae are present, the parasite infects and sterilizes the eggs of female wasps, causing them to be infertile. These infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus <b>spread</b> <b>the</b> nematode. This control method has proven to be relatively successful to combat the Sirex–Amylostereum complex. In the Southern Hemisphere, where the technique has been widely employed, reductions of parasitism levels of 70%–100% have been achieved.|$|E
