50|$|Once {{the paper}} is liberated from the spine, it can be scanned one sheet at a time using a {{traditional}} flatbed <b>scanner</b> or automatic <b>document</b> <b>feeder.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Document</b> <b>scanners</b> have <b>document</b> <b>feeders,</b> usually {{larger than}} those {{sometimes}} found on copiers or all-purpose scanners. Scans are made at high speed, perhaps 20 to 150 pages per minute, often in grayscale, although many scanners support color. Many scanners can scan both sides of double-sided originals (duplex operation). Sophisticated <b>document</b> <b>scanners</b> have firmware or software that cleans up scans of text as they are produced, eliminating accidental marks and sharpening type; this would be unacceptable for photographic work, where marks cannot reliably be distinguished from desired fine detail. Files created are compressed as they are made.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the dedicated OMR device, desktop OMR software allows a user {{to create their own}} forms in a word processor and print them on a laser printer. The OMR software then works with a common desktop image <b>scanner</b> with a <b>document</b> <b>feeder</b> to process the forms once filled out.|$|R
5000|$|In {{multifunction}} or all-in-one printers, fax machines, photocopiers and <b>scanners,</b> {{an automatic}} <b>document</b> <b>feeder</b> or ADF is a feature which takes several pages and feeds the paper one page {{at a time}} into a scanner or copier, allowing the user to scan, and thereby copy, print, or fax, multiple-page documents without having to manually replace each page. Most copiers allow scanning on the flatbed or platen (the [...] "glass") or through a <b>document</b> <b>feeder.</b> The vast majority of fax machines have an ADF, allowing the unattended sending of multi-page faxes. Due to the ubiquity of ADF in fax machines, some fax machine owners use the fax machine as a <b>scanner,</b> faxing multi-page <b>documents</b> to themselves. <b>Document</b> <b>feeders</b> are described by speed, in pages per minute or ppm, and capacity, usually in a range from 10 sheets to 200.|$|R

Every test created with AATE is stored in the database together with its parameters {{and it can be}} printed when needed. After the examination the filled forms are imported to the system {{with the help of a}} <b>scanner</b> equipped with <b>document</b> <b>feeder.</b> Then the system analyzes the forms and compares the detected answers with a template stored in the database. When the document processing is completed, the final results are also added to the database, from which they can be retrieved and printed at any moment...|$|R
50|$|In November 1992, Avision {{made its}} first <b>{{document}}</b> <b>scanners</b> (AV800C, ODM) with an ADF (auto <b>document</b> <b>feeder)</b> which can hold a 50-page document at one time.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of <b>document</b> <b>feeders</b> capable of two-sided (duplex) scanning: a {{reversing}} automatic <b>document</b> <b>feeder</b> or RADF scans one side of a page, then flips it and scans the other side. A duplexing automatic <b>document</b> <b>feeder</b> or DADF scans both sides in one pass. The advantage of the DADF is faster speed for two-sided originals. RADFs and DADFs are rated in images per minute (IPM), the number of sides they can scan each minute; this may depend upon the resolution being used (rather than the maximum resolution supported).|$|R

50|$|Another {{category}} of <b>document</b> <b>scanner</b> is the <b>document</b> camera. Capturing images on document cameras {{differs from that}} of flatbed and Automatic <b>document</b> <b>feeder</b> (ADF) <b>scanners</b> in that there are no moving parts required to scan the object. Conventionally either the illumination/reflector rod inside the scanner must be moved over the document (such as for a flatbed <b>scanner),</b> or the <b>document</b> must be passed over the rod (such as for feeder scanners) in order to produce a scan of a whole image. Document cameras capture the whole document or object in one step, usually instantly. Typically, documents are placed on a flat surface, usually the office desk, underneath the capture area of the document camera. The process of whole-surface-at-once capturing has the benefit of increasing reaction time for the work flow of scanning. After being captured, the images are usually processed through software which may enhance the image and perform such tasks like automatically rotating, cropping and straightening them.|$|R

5000|$|In 1938 Chester Carlson, a {{physicist}} working independently, invented {{a process for}} printing images using an electrically charged photoconductor-coated metal plate and dry powder [...] "toner".

50|$|Duplex {{scanning}} {{is usually}} implemented on multifunction printers using a Reversing Automatic <b>Document</b> <b>Feeder</b> (RADF), which removes, reverses, and re-feeds the document after scanning one side. Duplex scanning is achieved on scanners by either RADF or by single pass duplex scanning using two cameras, {{one for each}} side of the document; two-camera scanners scan twice as fast as a similar two-pass scanner.|$|R
50|$|Xerox's {{first foray}} into duplicating, as {{distinct}} from copying, was with the Xerox 2400, introduced in 1966. The model number denoted the number of prints produced in an hour. Although not as fast as offset printing, this machine introduced the industry's first automatic <b>document</b> <b>feeder,</b> paper slitter and perforator, and collator (sorter). This product was soon sped up by fifty percent to become the Xerox 3600 Duplicator.|$|R
50|$|Consumer and low-to-medium volume office {{printers}} use a duplexing {{unit that}} reverses {{a piece of}} paper after the first side has been printed. Duplex multifunction printers that also support duplex scanning have a reversing automatic <b>document</b> <b>feeder</b> (RADF) for scanning both sides. Higher volume printers may effectively have two print engines in a single device, and are able to print both sides of the paper in a single pass.|$|R

5000|$|Various {{types of}} {{unsupervised}} batch scanning are also possible {{with a minimum}} of support needed in the backend (driver). Many scanners support the attachment of <b>document</b> <b>feeders</b> which allow a large number of sheets of paper to be automatically scanned in succession. Using the SANE API, the frontend simply has to [...] "play back" [...] the same set of options for each scan, driving the document feed in between scans to load the next sheet of paper. The frontend only has to obtain the set of options from the user once.|$|R

5000|$|The {{very first}} DocuTech system, {{known as the}} DocuTech Production Publisher was {{announced}} on October 2, 1990. Its 135 page-per minute, black and white, xerographic print engine and attached finisher module were largely based on ones previously developed for the Xerox 5090 Duplicator system (announced by Xerox in 1988). However, image generation in the DocuTech was performed using a digitally driven, dual-beam, Laser ROS (Raster Output Scanner) {{rather than by the}} light-lens optics and exposure lamps found in the [...] "analog" [...] 5090 system. The system's <b>scanner</b> module allowed <b>document</b> scanning in a number of modes including manually from the platen or automatically using a 23 page-per-minute recirculating <b>document</b> <b>feeder.</b> The <b>scanner</b> also had a semi-automatic side feeder which could be used to scan large originals and computer fan-fold (CFF) input. The entire system was controlled by an electronic sub-system (ESS) of a proprietary Xerox design. The ESS incorporated a large number of Xerox proprietary Mesa processors which were specifically designed for high-speed image processing, 32 MegaBytes of RAM, I/O control interfaces for communicating with the Printer and Scanner modules, as well as 3 disk drives which contained system software and space for storing images (including those for saved jobs).|$|R

50|$|For book {{scanning}} {{on a low}} budget, {{the least}} expensive method to scan a book or magazine is {{to cut off the}} binding. This converts the book or magazine into a sheaf of looseleaf papers, which can then be loaded into a standard automatic <b>document</b> <b>feeder</b> (ADF) and scanned using inexpensive and common scanning technology. While this is not a desirable solution for very old and uncommon books, it is a useful tool for book and magazine scanning where the book is not an expensive collector's item and replacement of the scanned content is easy. There are two technical difficulties with this process, first with the cutting and second with the scanning.|$|R

This paper presents a study of the methodology of process monitoring for a RDF system. A fault tree has been established that shows the cause-and-effect relationship regarding possible malfunctions of a RDF system. Critical components of the RDF system have been identified for condition monitoring. The signature from the measurements of position, vibration, vacuum pressure, and drive motor current have been analysed. A data separation scheme was used in signal processing to demodulate the strong signal component associated with paper passage. Unique index extraction algorithms based on time series analysis and modeling have been developed to detect failures of these components.

50|$|In {{the past}} and presently, some OMR systems require special paper, special ink and a special input reader (Bergeron, 1998). This restricts the types of {{questions}} that can be asked and {{does not allow for}} much variability when the form is being input. Progress in OMR now allows users to create and print their own forms and use a scanner (preferably with a <b>document</b> <b>feeder)</b> to read the information. The user is able to arrange questions in a format that suits their needs while still being able to easily input the data. OMR systems approach one hundred percent accuracy and only take 5 milliseconds on average to recognize marks. Users can use squares, circles, ellipses and hexagons for the mark zone. The software can then be set to recognize filled in bubbles, crosses or check marks.|$|R
