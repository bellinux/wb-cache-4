5|$|In 2007, Dunst reprised {{her role}} as Mary Jane Watson in Spider-Man 3. In {{contrast}} to the previous two films' positive reviews, Spider-Man 3 received mixed reviews from critics. Nonetheless, with a total worldwide gross of $891million, it stands as the most commercially successful film in the series and Dunst's highest-grossing film {{to the end of}} 2008. Having initially signed on for three Spider-Man films, she revealed that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> a fourth, but only if Raimi and Maguire also returned. In January 2010, it was announced that the fourth film was cancelled and that the Spider-Man film series would be restarted, and therefore dropping Dunst, Maguire and Raimi from the franchise.|$|E
25|$|Charlie asks Sarah what <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if Leslie {{went away}} {{and did not}} come back. Nancy becomes angry at him for asking. Sarah is upset by the {{question}} and {{wants to go back}} to the sea. Leslie hits and chokes Charlie for making Sarah cry. Leslie and Sarah decide to go back. Nancy tells them to stay because eventually they will have to come back. Nancy, and to some degree Charlie, offer their help. Leslie accepts their offer.|$|E
60|$|He {{dropped his}} hands to the counter by habit and {{stood for a moment}} {{regarding}} her awkwardly. What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> <b>Would</b> <b>she</b> cut him? She came across the shop to him.|$|R

25|$|Leslie acts {{most often}} on instinct, like an animal. When birds and jets fly overhead, he runs {{to find an}} escape route. Leslie is very {{protective}} of Sarah. When Charlie hurts Sarah—asking her what <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if Leslie left and never came back—Leslie attacks him. After hitting him, Leslie nearly chokes him until the females intercede. After the incident, Leslie decides that he and Sarah will {{go back into the}} sea, to escape this threat. When Nancy tells him that they will have to come back eventually and offers them help, it is Leslie who accepts this fate.|$|E
25|$|The lizards' {{communication}} is somewhat {{similar to their}} human counterparts. Like Nancy, Sarah is more open to the humans and more interested in their world. She is also emotional, and when Charlie asks her a question that is {{hard for her to}} understand (what <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if Leslie disappeared), she becomes distraught, leading to a confrontation. Leslie shares Charlie's attitude; he does not trust the humans and regards most everything they say with skepticism. Despite these problems, {{at the end of the}} play, some measure of trust is reached between all of them. Leslie decides that he and Sarah will stay on land when Nancy and Charlie, albeit reluctantly, offer to help them.|$|E
25|$|Though Sarah is more deferential than Nancy, {{she does}} assert herself to Leslie when an {{experience}} is important. For example, she insists on accompanying Leslie when {{he approaches the}} humans in act II after they have taken their submissive pose. Sarah wants to see everything for herself. Most of the new things she encounters intrigue her: the handshakes; Nancy's breasts; human gestation; and the birds flying above them, among other things. But she is also fearful. The jets frighten her, as does Charlie when he asks her what <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if Leslie went away and never came back. Like Leslie, Sarah does not grasp many human concepts like emotions and nonaquatic animals, though she tries.|$|E

60|$|Before {{taking down}} the spar and sail, he had deliberated {{as to whether}} {{it would be better to}} run before the coming gale or to lie to, and had decided on the latter alternative, as, were it to {{continue}} to blow long, he might be driven on to the Egyptian coast. Moreover, the felucca's bow was much higher out of water than the stern, and he thought that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> ride over the waves with greater safety than <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>did</b> they sweep down upon her stern.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, Nathan-Turner {{was trying}} to figure out what to do about K-9. The robot dog was very popular among {{children}} but was difficult to deal with technically and Nathan-Turner felt that it made the TARDIS crew almost overwhelmingly formidable. He decided that a child-orientated spin-off series with K-9 might be just the thing. However, such a series would require a human as the lead, and his prime candidate for this role was Sladen. He pitched the part to the actress as a departure from what she had previously done: she would be returning as Sarah Jane Smith, but <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so as the heroine and not just a sidekick. This offer Sladen accepted.|$|E
25|$|Miss Eirlys Edwards, a {{clerk in}} Newport Education Department (with no {{training}} or experience in matters of child welfare), testified {{on the second day}} that she visited Bank Farm on 20 December 1944, and observed that the boys were treated with little affection, and while Terence appeared to be well cared for, Dennis appeared ill and frightened; she asked Mrs Gough to call a doctor to examine him, which she said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do.</b> She had recommended to her superiors that the boys be removed and Mr W. J. Edmonds, Newport's Deputy Director of Education, confirmed that he had requested Shropshire Education Committee to do so, although the Goughs had not yet been informed of this decision.|$|E
25|$|A mid-2012 Pew Research {{study of}} public {{opinions}} found that Clinton was viewed positively in Japan and most European countries {{in terms of}} people having confidence that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> the right thing in world affairs. She received mixed marks in China, Russia, and some Central and South American countries, and low marks in Muslim countries, on this question. Overall, Clinton's attempts to improve the image of America in Muslim countries did not find any immediate success due to many factors, including the unpopularity of drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere. Perceptions of the U.S. in those countries declined during her tenure according to a Pew Research, which found that only 15 percent of Muslims had a favorable impression of the U.S. in 2012, compared to 25 percent in 2009. Specifically in Pakistan, only 12 percent of Pakistanis had a favorable impression of the U.S. in 2012, compared to 16 percent in 2009, and only 3 percent had confidence in Clinton compared to 37 percent not.|$|E

25|$|After Elvis Presley's {{death in}} 1977, Vernon Presley served as {{executor}} of his estate. Upon {{his death in}} 1979, he chose Priscilla {{to serve as the}} estate executor for Elvis' only child, Lisa Marie who was only 11. Graceland itself cost $500,000 a year in upkeep, and expenses had dwindled Elvis' and Priscilla's daughter Lisa Marie's inheritance to only $1 million. Taxes were due on the property, those and other expenses due came to over $500,000. Faced with having to sell Graceland, Priscilla examined other famous houses/museums, and hired a CEO, Jack Soden, to turn Graceland into a moneymaker. Graceland was opened to the public on June 7, 1982. Priscilla's gamble paid off; after only a month of opening Graceland's doors the estate made back all the money it had invested. Priscilla Presley became the chairwoman and president of Elvis Presley Enterprises, or EPE, stating at that time <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so until Lisa Marie reached 21 years of age. The enterprise's fortunes soared and eventually the trust grew to be worth over $100 million.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} book, after seeing Harry fly masterfully {{his very first}} time on a broom, she {{recommends}} him to fill the position of Seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team and sends him a broom, even though first-year students are normally prohibited from playing the sport or owning brooms. Despite {{the fact that she}} can often be heard to caution Lee Jordan's biased remarks while commenting Hogwart's Quidditch matches, it is often indirectly revealed that McGonagall herself is an avid Quidditch fan, resulting in a few occasions of her dropping her usual demeanour. Furthermore, although a rigorous disciplinarian, she often assists Harry indirectly with activities that are not strictly within the rules of Hogwarts; for example, she allows Harry and his friends to use the Transfiguration classroom to practice for tasks in the Triwizard Tournament. She promises Harry <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> everything in her power to help him to achieve his goal of becoming an auror, and she keeps her promise. Despite her stern front, McGonagall is shown to have good intentions at heart and has been known to display a range of emotions, which can often be a shock to her colleagues and students.|$|E
500|$|According to Nancy Milford, Scott and Zelda's first {{encounter}} {{was at a}} country club dance in Montgomery, which Scott later portrayed fictionally by writing it into his novel, The Great Gatsby, when he describes Jay Gatsby's {{first encounter}} with Daisy Buchanan, although he transposed the location in the novel to a train station. Scott {{was not the only}} man courting Zelda, and the competition only drove Scott to want her more. In the ledger that he meticulously maintained throughout his life, Scott noted in 1918, on September 7, that he had fallen in love. Ultimately, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> the same. Her biographer Nancy Milford wrote, [...] "Scott had appealed to something in Zelda which no one before him had perceived: a romantic sense of self-importance which was kindred to his own." ...|$|E

She also sings the lines [...] "Let me feed you, let me run your bath water, {{whatever}} you desire" [...] after the thins she had previously listed. Rowland was noted for nearly rapping her solo part during which she promises to [...] "keep my figure right," [...] "keep my hair fixed" [...] and acknowledges that if her man comes later home while she's asleep, [...] "all he's gotta do is tap her {{on the shoulder and}} 'I'll roll over.'" [...] Williams sings her solo verses during the song's bridge.|$|E
500|$|She {{would start}} her day at 4am with calisthenics, {{meditation}} {{and an hour}} of yoga exercises. At night, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> yoga again, then read until midnight. She picked up yoga at age 69, when she bought a book titled Forever Young, Forever Healthy. She also taught yoga to the young and old at temples, associations, hospitals and schools. She ate sparely; her breakfast was {{a glass of water}} or milk. Lunch was often milk and salad, unless [...] "people bring me food", and it was milk or yogurt for dinner. At home, she had a 2,000-volume private library she called Prema, which in Sanskrit means [...] "divine love". Her final days were kept busy with trips to help needy senior citizens, reading and yoga practice at her sparsely-furnished single-storey house attached to the Society for the Aged Sick.|$|E
500|$|Spector, {{also in the}} album's 1957 liner notes, {{reported}} on another of Angelou's concerts in the Beverly Hills nightclub The Keyboard, when she performed many of the songs on Miss Calypso. [...] He called her a polite, soft-spoken, calm, and poised young woman [...] "that completely mystified the audience". [...] He found that Angelou's performance made an indelible impression {{and that she had}} an unusual voice and striking appearance. [...] Spector stated, [...] "She had captured the audience swiftly and effectively with her calm and affectionate manner", and promised that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> the same for listeners of the album. [...] He also predicted that she was [...] "destined to become a very big name in show business". [...] Spector characterized Angelou's music as [...] "calypso style with a liberal sprinkling of Afro-Cuban, and a dash of blues mixed together with delicate jazz".|$|E

500|$|On 30 June, the [...] "Immortal Seven" [...] {{secretly}} requested William—then in the Dutch Republic with Mary—to come to England with an army to depose James. William {{had made}} known earlier that a military intervention, {{for which he}} had been assembling forces, would be conditional on such an invitation. At first, William was still reluctant; possibly he was jealous of his wife's position as the heiress to the English Crown and feared she would become more powerful than he was. According to Gilbert Burnet, however, Mary convinced her husband that she did not care for political power, and told him [...] "she would be no more but his wife, and that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> all that lay in her power to make him King for life". She would, she assured him, always obey her husband as she had promised to do in her marriage vows.|$|E
500|$|Minogue was {{eventually}} signed to Mushroom Records (folded today as Warner Music Australia, Warner owns the Mushroom catalogue) in early 1987. The first song that Minogue had ever considered to record was the successful [...] "The Loco-Motion", which she instantly {{fell in love}} with when she first heard it. When she performed for a fundraiser in Australia, she performed Sonny & Cher's song [...] "I Got You Babe". Alan Hardy, who asked Minogue to perform at the fundraiser, noticed that she was very nervous in performing. However, the crowd were estatic of her performance. Hardy later asked if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> another and, to her surprise, she performed [...] "The Loco-Motion", already rehearsing the song before the performance. Minogue went to record the song in Melbourne but could not record the song in the same key as the backing track, so she went to improve her vocals so she could change her pitch to a E minor.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{of the new}} {{characters}} for series 1 {{was announced}} on 25 November 2009.

Yorke said [...] "She was so good that we suddenly went, 'It's her! Kenny said, [...] "I'm really thrilled to have been given the opportunity to both write for and act in a show connected with such an iconic drama as EastEnders. Kids these days use their laptops more than their televisions, so it's really exciting {{to be a part of}} a project that's taking drama online and connecting with these viewers." [...] To prepare for the role, Kenny had to disguise her [...] "posh" [...] accent, saying that when the director asked her what <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> about her voice, she travelled around the East End to listen to the way people spoke.|$|E
