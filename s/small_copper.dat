5|$|There {{are several}} local nature {{reserves}} {{in and around}} Taunton, which are protected under a statutory designation in Section 21 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. South Taunton Streams is an urban wetland, and in the northern suburbs is the Children's Wood riverside reserve which provides a movement corridor for animals including otters {{along the banks of}} the River Tone. Birds occurring at the site include: kingfisher, dipper, grey wagtail, mute swan, grey heron and reed warbler. It is also home to butterflies such as the small and large skipper, marbled white, small heath and <b>small</b> <b>copper,</b> and to dragonflies and damselflies.|$|E
5|$|Aurelian's {{attempt to}} reform the {{currency}} had failed; the denarius was dead. Diocletian restored the three-metal coinage and issued better quality pieces. The new system consisted of five coins: the aureus/solidus, a gold coin weighing, like its predecessors, one-sixtieth of a pound; the argenteus, a coin weighing one ninety-sixth of a pound and containing ninety-five percent pure silver; the follis, {{sometimes referred to as}} the laureatus A, which is a copper coin with added silver struck at the rate of thirty-two to the pound; the radiatus, a <b>small</b> <b>copper</b> coin struck at the rate of 108 to the pound, with no added silver; and a coin known today as the laureatus B, a smaller copper coin struck at the rate of 192 to the pound. Since the nominal values of these new issues were lower than their intrinsic worth as metals, the state was minting these coins at a loss. This practice could be sustained only by requisitioning precious metals from private citizens in exchange for state-minted coin (of a far lower value than the price of the precious metals requisitioned).|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, English Nature {{identify}} a further 117 species that use ragwort as a nectar source whilst travelling between feeding and breeding sites, or between metapopulations. These consist mainly of solitary bees, hoverflies, moths, and butterflies {{such as the}} <b>small</b> <b>copper</b> butterfly (Lycaena phlaeas). Pollen is collected by solitary bees.|$|E
50|$|Dance aprons and {{leggings}} {{were also}} worn during ceremonies. The aprons were often decorated with trinkets such as <b>small</b> <b>coppers,</b> puffin beaks, deer hoofs, etc., which produced pleasing sounds while dancing.|$|R

25|$|In the 1220 {{inquiries}} it {{was said}} that in the Royal Land of Varzim, a royal butler area, there were 20 families, who gave to the King, when he came into town, 6 dinheiros for the stay; and by Royal Charter, if they did not go to the sea on Friday, they paid 5 mealhas (<b>small</b> <b>copper</b> coin with little value); and paid from the fisheries, the navão (one fish for each boat).|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} the economy and trade meant that <b>small</b> <b>copper</b> {{currency}} became insufficient to cover the amounts that were being exchanged. During the Sengoku period, the characteristics of the future Edo Period system began to emerge. Local Lords developed trade, abolishing monopolistic guilds, which led to the need for large-denomination currencies. From the 16th century, local experiments started to be made, with the minting of local coins, sometimes in gold. Especially the Takeda clan of Kōshū minted gold coins which were later adopted by the Tokugawa shogunate.|$|E
500|$|Firstly, a cloth is washed, soaked {{and beaten}} {{with a large}} mallet. Patterns are drawn with pencil and later redrawn using hot wax, usually made from a mixture of {{paraffin}} or beeswax, sometimes mixed with plant resins, which functions as a dye-resist. The wax can be applied {{with a variety of}} tools. A pen-like instrument called a canting ( [...] , sometimes spelled with old Dutch orthography tjanting) is the most common. A tjanting is made from a <b>small</b> <b>copper</b> reservoir with a spout on a wooden handle. The reservoir holds the resist which flows through the spout, creating dots and lines as it moves. For larger patterns, a stiff brush may be used. Alternatively, a copper block stamp called a cap ( [...] ; old spelling tjap) is used to cover large areas more efficiently.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{formerly}} {{part of the}} medieval Royal Forest of Rockingham. It has diverse habitats, with hay meadows, parkland and recently planted woodland. There are many butterflies such as large skippers, orange-tips, small skippers and <b>small</b> <b>coppers.</b> Mammals include baders and red foxes.|$|R
50|$|The {{sand dunes}} and {{shoreline}} plants support large numbers {{and a wide}} variety of insect species. Butterflies and moths present include common blues (Polyommatus icarus), small heaths (Coenonympha pamphilus), <b>small</b> <b>coppers</b> (Lycaena phlaeas), the sub-species caeruleopunctata, graylings (Hipparchia semele) and the six-spot burnet (Zygaena filipendulae).|$|R

2500|$|West Mexican smiths worked {{primarily}} in copper {{during the initial}} period, with some low-arsenic alloys, as well as occasional employment of silver and gold. Lost-wax cast bells were introduced from lower Central America and Colombia during this phase, along with several classes of cold-worked ornaments and hand tools, such as needles and tweezers. [...] The prototypes for these small, often utilitarian items appear rooted in southern Ecuador and northern Peru. <b>Small</b> <b>copper</b> rings, generally found in burial contexts, are also common to Ecuador and Western Mexico and are abundant during this phase.|$|E

The legend reads QUIESCAT PLEBS (May the People Be at Peace).|$|R
2500|$|The line did pick up {{significant}} {{traffic from}} sawmills in the area, {{some of which}} had their own sidings. A connection was made with the Tyers Valley Tramway at Collins siding, between Watson and Erica. While the tramway used the same gauge as the railway, there was no physical connection, timber being transhipped by hand. A temporary connection {{had to be put}} in place to move locomotives to and from the tramway. A <b>small</b> <b>copper</b> mine and two lime kilns near Platina provided additional traffic. A series of [...] "Back to Walhalla" [...] days in the 1930s caused the railways to put on special passenger trains for these occasions, and such was the demand some were double-headed.|$|E
2500|$|In Denmark, {{large areas}} of forested land were cleared {{to be used for}} pasture and the growing of cereals during the Single Grave culture and in the Late Neolithic Period. [...] Faint traces of Bell Beaker {{influence}} can be recognized already in the pottery of the Upper Grave phase of the Single Grave period, and even of the late Ground Grave phase, such as occasional use of AOO-like or zoned decoration and other typical ornamentation, while Bell Beaker associated objects such as wristguards and <b>small</b> <b>copper</b> trinkets, also found their way into this northern territories of the Corded Ware Culture. [...] Domestic sites with Beakers only appear 200–300 years after the first appearance of Bell Beakers in Europe, at {{the early part of the}} Danish Late Neolithic Period (LN I) starting at 2350 BC. These sites are concentrated in northern Jutland around the Limfjord and on the Djursland peninsula, largely contemporary to the local Upper Grave Period. In east central Sweden and western Sweden, barbed wire decoration characterised the period 2460–1990 BC, linked to another Beaker derivation of northwestern Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Around 950, Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus {{recorded}} that Hungarians {{inhabited the}} region {{to the north of}} the Iron Gates. He mentioned five riversthe Timiș, the [...] "Toutis", the Mureş, the Criş and the Tiszathat flow through the Hungarians' territory. Medieval settlements named after Hungarian tribes confirm that Hungarian communities settled in the lowlands already in the [...] Rivers, mountains and settlements bearing Hungarian names in the Middle Ages also show the presence of Hungarian-speaking groups. The Byzantine historian  John Skylitzes wrote of a Hungarian chieftain, Gylas, who was baptized in Constantinople in the early 950s. On this occasion, a Greek monk, Hierotheus was ordained [...] "bishop of Turkey" [...] (that is bishop of Hungary) to accompany Gylas back to his homeland. Bishop Hierotheus [...] "converted many from the barbaric fallacy to Christianity", according to Skylitzes. Traditional scholarly consensus holds that Gylas ruled Transylvania (to the east of Banat), but the concentration of Byzantine coins minted between 948 and 959 at the confluence of the Tisza and the Mureş may indicate that Gylas's seat was located in Banat. The only 10th-century pectoral cross (a <b>small</b> <b>copper</b> cross) in the region was discovered at Deta.|$|E
5000|$|The {{site was}} {{formerly}} a [...] "gathering ground" [...] for water from springs {{and was used}} as a water source until the 1970s. It is mainly woodland with some marsh, meadow and open rides. One area has semi-natural birch and ash woods, and the marsh has moschatel and mature hazel and alder coppice. There are badgers and foxes, and butterflies including common browns and <b>small</b> <b>coppers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>smaller</b> <b>copper</b> medallion, with a {{diameter}} of 47 mm, was created at the same time. The medal was made for White's personal servant, William Broughton and omits the ship scene, being inscribed simply with an abridged version of the journey.

It {{has been suggested that}} this medal should [...] "rank as equal in rarity and significance" [...] as its silver counterpart.|$|R
25|$|The Nationalists issued {{their first}} {{official}} coins in 1937. These were holed 25 céntimos featuring a rising sun and {{a clutch of}} arrows. These coins were minted in Vienna. A <b>smaller</b> <b>copper</b> 25 céntimos followed in 1938. Following {{the end of the}} Civil War in 1939, the victorious Nationalist government introduced aluminium 5 and 10 céntimos in 1940 featuring a conquistador, followed by reduced size aluminium-bronze 1-peseta coins in 1944 featuring the state crest and national symbols.|$|R
2500|$|The {{town house}} has been {{described}} as having a [...] "flat roofline, rectangular profile and somewhat delicate lintel detail - in addition to neo-classical window spacing and a main facade with spindly belfry steeple". The building has been compared to the Scottish National Library on George IV Bridge in Edinburgh for having a modern style with classical or traditional elements and recognised for Scandinavian influences. The base of the town house features Darney stone from East Woodburn, with the walls being made from Blaxter stone, both of which were brought north to the town from Northumberland quarries. The surroundings of the main entrance are made of Elverwater stone. The stone on the walls was done by retired masons from around the ages of 65 to 80. The clock tower of Nordic influence, which sits on top of the building, complete with a weather vane, shows St Bryce, the patron saint of Kirkcaldy. The unique design was done by David Carr of Edinburgh. A <b>small</b> <b>copper</b> ball, [...] in diameter, {{at the bottom of the}} vane, is supposed to represent the world. The figure is located at the top of the [...] weather vane with the intention he can look across the town as the vane turns around in the wind, with the world at his feet. The vane, probably made of wrought iron, was designed by Thomas Hadden of Edinburgh.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{presence}} of either quicklime or saltpeter in the mixture cannot be entirely excluded, they were consequently not the primary ingredient. Most modern scholars agree that Greek fire was based on petroleum, either crude or refined; comparable to modern napalm. The Byzantines had easy access to crude oil from the naturally occurring wells around the Black Sea (e.g., the wells around Tmutorakan noted by Constantine Porphyrogennetos) or in various locations throughout the Middle East. An alternate name for Greek fire was [...] "Median fire" [...] (...) , and the 6th-century historian Procopius, records that crude oil, called [...] "naphtha" [...] (in Greek: [...] naphtha, from Old Persian [...] naft) by the Persians, was known to the Greeks as [...] "Median oil" [...] (...) [...] This seems to corroborate the use of naphtha as a basic ingredient of Greek fire. Naphtha was also used by the Abbasids in the 9th century, with special troops, the naffāṭūn, who wore thick protective suits and used <b>small</b> <b>copper</b> vessels containing burning oil, which they threw onto the enemy troops. There is also a surviving 9th century Latin text, preserved at Wolfenbüttel in Germany, which mentions the ingredients of {{what appears to be}} Greek fire and the operation of the siphōns used to project it. Although the text contains some inaccuracies, it clearly identifies the main component as naphtha. Resins were probably added as a thickener (the Praecepta Militaria refer to the substance as , [...] "sticky fire"), and to increase the duration and intensity of the flame. A modern theoretical concoction included the use of pine tar and animal fat along with other ingredients.|$|E
