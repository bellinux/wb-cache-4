The author examines the overall structure of relationships involved in Le Play’s typology and observes that both the stem-family and the unstable family area in the Southern Europe are marked by a small, close-knit network of strong ties, with kinship predominance. Vice versa, the social <b>support</b> <b>hinges</b> upon a network of kin in the stem-family area, upon an alliance among different kindred units in the unstable Mediterranean area. All this leads to formulating a hypothesis of a tri-partite model for Western European relationship models. How can we explain the relationship between family predominance as anthropological embedding and family collapse as demographic reaction? The author reconsiders this question {{in the light of}} Festinger’s cognitive dissonance theory and Elder’s ‘principle of accentuation’: different, regionally rooted, family and kinship patterns "react" in contact with an appropriate reagent, such as the macro-process of modernisation, generating different patterns of today’s demographic behaviour. anthropological demography, family patterns, fertility change, Mediterranean Europe, social networks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—As they guide {{people in}} {{performing}} a task, procedures are {{the heart of}} most manuals. It is, therefore, somewhat surprising that the theoretical and empirical knowledge of their nature has remained somewhat elusive. This paper describes a theoretical framework for procedures, summarized as the four components model, which is grounded in systems theory and rhetoric. The study addresses two research questions: (1) What are procedures made of? and (2) Which design guidelines for procedures can be abstracted from theory and research? The model distinguishes between: goals, prerequisite states, unwanted states (warnings and problem-solving information), and actions and reactions. For each component pertinent research findings are summarized and lead to the formulation of design guidelines. Occasionally these guidelines are compared with existing procedures from a sample of 104 manuals {{to see how well}} theory and practice agree. The model offers a manageable and expandable framework for creating user support that is based on scientific research. It can be used for a systematic analysis of procedures and for their (re) design. Index Terms—Design guidelines, information typology, instructional design, screen captures.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{intrinsic}} fully-gapped odd-parity superconducting order in doped nodal-loop materials with a torus-shaped Fermi surface. We {{show that the}} mirror symmetry, which protects the nodal loop in the normal state, also protects the superconducting state as a topological crystalline superconductor. As a result, the surfaces preserving the mirror symmetry host gapless Majorana cones. Moreover, for a Weyl loop system (two-fold degenerate at the nodal loop), the surfaces that break the mirror symmetry (those parallel to the bulk nodal loop) contribute a Chern (winding) number to the quasi-two-dimensional system in a slab geometry, {{which leads to a}} quantized thermal Hall effect and a single Majorana zero mode bound at a vortex line penetrating the system. This Chern number {{can be viewed as a}} higher-order topological invariant, which <b>supports</b> <b>hinge</b> modes in a cubic sample when mirror symmetry is broken. For a Dirac loop system (four-fold degenerate at the nodal loop), the fully gapped odd-parity can be either time-reversal symmetry-breaking or symmetric, similar to the A- and B- phases of ^ 3 He. In a slab geometry, the A-phase has a Chern number two, while the B-phase carries a nontrivial Z_ 2 invariant. We discuss the experimental relevance of our results to nodal-loop materials such as CaAgAs. Comment: 15 pages, 7 figures, 2 appendice...|$|R

In line with the purpose mentioned, a total of two hundred representative female survivors of domestic violence taken {{from all over the country}} were assessed through a single-time questionnaire survey by using Social Support questionnaire and Conflict Tactic Scale Questionnaire. By materializing mean comparison method of statistics, the research findings have apparently divulged that there was no remarkable mean difference in social support based on any aforesaid demographic factors. Likewise, different forms of wife abuse were not noteworthy contributing to the mean difference of social support among them. Accordingly, these results have indicated that social support has undoubtedly been paramount to helping the female survivors of abuse in healing process regardless of their different background.

25|$|Even well-intentioned support can {{negatively}} {{impact the}} care recipient's psychological adjustment to stressful events {{if it is}} inappropriate or excessive, or inadvertently highlights {{the fact that the}} care recipient does not have sufficient skills or resources to handle the stressor by him- or herself. Consequently, Niall Bolger and colleagues have put forward the idea that support is most effective when it is invisible, or operates outside of the care-recipient's direct awareness. To investigate this proposition, the researchers recruited couples in which one member was a law student preparing to undergo a highly stressful event, the New York State Bar Examination, and had both members of the couple complete daily diary entries about given and received emotional support. They found that the law students exhibited heightened levels of depression on days they reported receiving support, but lowered levels of depression on the days when their partners reported providing more support than the law students reported receiving. That is, participants in this study gained most psychological benefits from support they were not explicitly aware of having received. However, other researchers have argued that the responsiveness of enacted support is a more important factor than the visibility of the support. One study examining the effects of visible and invisible support on emotional and relationship well-being showed that visible support was linked to neutral or positive outcomes when it was high in responsiveness, and invisible support was linked to negative outcomes when it was low in responsiveness. That is, visible support is not always negative and invisible support is not always positive, but the effectiveness of both types of <b>support</b> <b>hinges</b> on responsiveness.|$|R

Bronze drums {{are important}} to the culture of the Karen people, who live mainly in Burma and the mountainous region between Burma and Thailand. A Karen bronze drum, which is cast in one piece, consists of an overlapping tympanum that may range from nine to thirty inches in diameter and a cylinder that is slightly longer than the diameter. Bronze drums have a variety of use, both musical and nonmusical. The acoustical properties of this drum, which have never previously been studied, are presented. Both the sound spectrum and the vibration spectrum of the Karen drum show a large number of modes of vibration, especially in the frequency range up to 2 kHz. Although there is no single dominant strike tone, prominent partials can be heard around 330 Hz, 277 Hz, and 247 Hz plus a low hum tone around 55 Hz. With the exception of the hum tone, these are associated with identifiable modes of vibration or mode combinations. The many modes observed with TV holography can be classified as 1) primarily modes of the cylinder, 2) primarily modes of the tympanum, or 3) mode mixtures. When arranged into families according to the number of nodal circles n, the cylinder mode frequencies for n = 1 and n - 2 families appear to have a minimum at some value of m, as predicted by the theory of vibrations in a capped cylindrical shell. The tympanum mode frequencies are in better agreement with those calculated for a flat brass plate with a simply <b>supported</b> (<b>hinged)</b> edge as compared to a clamped edge. The observed mode frequencies are consistently less than the calculated frequencies, however, because of increased mass due to the lead impurity and to the mass of the portion of the tympanum overhanging the cylinder.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} roots of white support for capital {{punishment}} in the United States. Our analysis addresses individual-level and contextual factors, paying particular attention to how racial attitudes and racial composition influence white support for capital punishment. Our findings suggest that white <b>support</b> <b>hinges</b> {{on a range of}} attitudes wider than prior research has indicated, including social and governmental trust and individualist and authoritarian values. Extending individual-level analyses, we also find that white responses to capital punishment are sensitive to local context. Perhaps most important, our results clarify the impact of race in two ways. First, racial prejudice emerges here as a comparatively strong predictor of white support for the death penalty. Second, black residential proximity functions to polarize white opinion along lines of racial attitude. As the black percentage of county residents rises, so too does the impact of racial prejudice on white support for capital punishment. States, as Max Weber famously observed, are distinguished in part by their claim to a legitimate monopoly over the use of violence within a given territory (Gerth and Mills 1946, 78). This claim is nowhere more evident, or controversial, than when the state kills an individual it has convicted of a capital crime (Sarat 2001). In a majority of countries, laws permit the state to impose lifelong incarceration, but withhold the authority to take life. At present 109 countries reject the death penalty in law or practice; 86 retain and use the death penalty, but most do not do so with great regularity (AI 2001). No country in Western Europe currently practices capital punishment; and in 1999, the U. N. Commission on Human Rights called for a worldwide moratorium on executions (Dieter 1999). Between 1990 and 2001, over 30 countries abolished this mode of pun...|$|R
