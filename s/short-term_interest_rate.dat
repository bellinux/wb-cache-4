25|$|Under {{inflation}} targeting, {{open market}} operations target a specific <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> in the debt markets. This target is changed periodically to achieve and maintain an inflation rate within a target range. However, other variants of monetary policy also often target interest rates: the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank use variations on interest rate targets to guide {{open market operations}}.|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} an {{increased}} demand for base money, the central bank must act if it wishes to maintain the <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> It does this by increasing the supply of base money: {{it goes to the}} open market to buy a financial asset, such as government bonds. To pay for these assets, new central bank money is generated in the seller's loro account, increasing the total amount of base money in the economy. Conversely, if the central bank sells these assets in the open market, the base money is reduced.|$|E

In this context, we aim to determine the efficient level of <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> on dollar rate.

25|$|The {{alternate}} case {{is where}} the government receives more taxes on a particular day than it spends. In this case, {{there may be a}} system-wide deficit of reserves. As a result, surplus funds will be in demand on the interbank market, and thus the <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> will rise towards the discount rate. Thus, if the central bank wants to maintain a target interest rate somewhere between the support rate and the discount rate, it must manage the liquidity in the system to ensure that there is the correct amount of reserves in the banking system.|$|E
25|$|Cash {{settlement}} − a {{cash payment}} is made {{based on the}} underlying reference rate, such as a <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> index such as 90 Day T-Bills, or the closing value of a stock market index. The parties settle by paying/receiving the loss/gain related to the contract in cash when the contract expires. Cash settled futures are those that, as a practical matter, could not be settled by delivery of the referenced item—for example, {{it would be impossible}} to deliver an index. A futures contract might also opt to settle against an index based on trade in a related spot market. ICE Brent futures use this method.|$|E
25|$|Under an MMT {{framework}} where {{government spending}} injects new reserves into the commercial banking system, and taxes withdraw {{it from the}} banking system, government activity would have an instant effect on interbank lending. If on a particular day, the government spends more than it taxes, reserves {{have been added to}} the banking system (see vertical transactions). This will typically lead to a system-wide surplus of reserves, with competition between banks seeking to lend their excess reserves forcing the <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> down to the support rate (or alternately, to zero if a support rate is not in place). At this point banks will simply keep their reserve surplus with their central bank and earn the support rate.|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the links}} between long and <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> is crucial for {{monetary}} policy makers, since Central Banks decide and set <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in order to affect indirectly long-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> which affects aggregate spending. This paper studies whether VAR/VEC models are useful in predicting long-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> for Brazil.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} regime-switching in a two-factor stochastic volatility (SV) {{model to}} explain the behavior of <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> We model the volatility of <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> as a stochastic volatility process whose mean is subject to shifts in regime. We estimate the regime-switching stochastic volatility (RSV) model using a Gibbs Sampling-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm.

25|$|In the U.S., the Federal Reserve most {{commonly}} uses overnight repurchase agreements (repos) to temporarily create money, or reverse repos to temporarily destroy money, which offset temporary {{changes in the}} level of bank reserves. The Federal Reserve also makes outright purchases and sales of securities through the System Open Market Account (SOMA) with its manager over the Trading Desk at the New York Reserve Bank. The trade of securities in the SOMA changes the balance of bank reserves, which also affects short-term interest rates. The SOMA manager is responsible for trades that result in a <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> near the target rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), or create money by the outright purchase of securities. More rarely will it permanently destroy money by the outright sale of securities. These trades are made with a group of about 22 banks and bond dealers called primary dealers.|$|E
25|$|An {{open market}} {{operation}} (OMO) is an activity by a central bank to give (or take) liquidity in its currency to (or from) a bank {{or a group of}} banks. The central bank can either buy or sell government bonds in the open market (this is where the name was historically derived from) or, in what is now mostly the preferred solution, enter into a repo or secured lending transaction with a commercial bank: the central bank gives the money as a deposit for a defined period and synchronously takes an eligible asset as collateral. A central bank uses OMO as the primary means of implementing monetary policy. The usual aim of {{open market operation}}s is - aside from supplying commercial banks with liquidity and sometimes taking surplus liquidity from commercial banks - to manipulate the <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> and the supply of base money in an economy, and thus indirectly control the total money supply, in effect expanding money or contracting the money supply. This involves meeting the demand of base money at the target interest rate by buying and selling government securities, or other financial instruments. Monetary targets, such as inflation, interest rates, or exchange rates, are used to guide this implementation.|$|E
2500|$|The Federal Reserve sets {{monetary}} policy by influencing {{the federal funds}} rate, which is the rate of interbank lending of excess reserves.

2500|$|Usually, the {{short-term}} goal of {{open market operations}} is to achieve a specific <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> target. In other instances, monetary policy might instead entail the targeting of a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency or else relative to gold. For example, {{in the case of}} the United States the Federal Reserve targets the federal funds rate, the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight. The other primary means of conducting monetary policy include: (i) Discount window lending (as lender of last resort); (ii) Fractional deposit lending (changes in the reserve requirement); (iii) Moral suasion (cajoling certain market players to achieve specified outcomes); (iv) [...] "Open mouth operations" [...] (talking monetary policy with the market).|$|E

40|$|When the Bank of Japan {{raises the}} uncollateralized {{overnight}} call rate, {{and if the}} market expects a deceleration of the economy, the increase in government bond yields is small, resulting in the diminution of the spread between long- and <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> This is because the spread between long- and <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> increases or decreases in anticipation of economic conditions and the inflation rate. Hence, the Cabinet Office uses this spread {{as one of the}} leading indicators in its diffusion index. This study has made an estimation of a model, which examines the yield curve (which contains more information than the spread between long- and <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates)</b> in order to forecast economic conditions and the inflation rate.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the stochastic behavior of <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in eleven countries. Following Chan et al.

40|$|During {{the past}} two decades of {{economic}} stagnation and persistent deflation in Japan, chronic fiscal deficits have led to elevated and rising ratios of government debt to nominal GDP. Nevertheless, long-term Japanese government bonds' (JGBs) nominal yields initially declined and have stayed remarkably low and stable since then. This is contrary to the received wisdom of the existing literature, which holds that higher government deficits and indebtedness shall exert upward pressures on government bonds' nominal yields. This paper seeks to understand the determinants of JGBs' nominal yields. It examines the relationship between JGBs' nominal yields and <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and other relevant factors, such as low inflation and persistent deflationary pressures and tepid growth. Low <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> induced by monetary policy, have been the main reason for JGBs' low nominal yields. It is also argued that Japan has monetary sovereignty, which gives the government of Japan the ability to meet its debt obligations. It enables the Bank of Japan to exert downward pressure on JGBs' nominal yields by allowing it to keep <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> low and to use other tools of monetary policy. The argument that current <b>short-term</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and monetary policy are the primary drivers of long-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> follows Keynes's (1930) insights...|$|R
