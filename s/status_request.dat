500|$|At 02:25 MYT, the aircraft's {{satellite}} communication system sent a [...] "log-on request" [...] message—the first {{message on the}} system since the ACARS transmission at 01:07—which was relayed by satellite to a ground station, both operated by satellite telecommunications company Inmarsat. After logging on to the network, the satellite data unit aboard the aircraft responded to hourly status requests from Inmarsat and two ground-to-aircraft phone calls, at 02:39 and 07:13, which went unanswered by the cockpit. The final <b>status</b> <b>request</b> and aircraft acknowledgement occurred at 08:10, about 1 hour and 40 minutes after it was scheduled to arrive in Beijing. The aircraft sent a log-on request at 08:19:29, which was followed, after a response from the ground station, by a [...] "log-on acknowledgement" [...] message at 08:19:37.

50|$|<b>Status</b> <b>request</b> failures, {{such as when}} a {{connection}} cannot be established, it times-out, or the document or message cannot be retrieved, usually produce an action from the monitoring system.

5000|$|OCSP {{stapling}} resolves both {{problems in}} a fashion reminiscent of the Kerberos ticket. In a stapling scenario, the certificate holder queries the OCSP server themselves at regular intervals, obtaining a signed time-stamped OCSP response. When the site's visitors attempt to connect to the site, this response is included ("stapled") with the TLS/SSL handshake via the Certificate <b>Status</b> <b>Request</b> extension response (note: the TLS client must explicitly include a Certificate <b>Status</b> <b>Request</b> extension in its ClientHello TLS/SSL handshake message). [...] While it may appear that allowing the site operator to control verification responses would allow a fraudulent site to issue false verification for a revoked certificate, the stapled responses can't be forged as {{they need to be}} directly signed by the certificate authority, not the server. If the client does not receive a stapled response, it will just contact the OCSP server by itself. [...] However, if the client receives an invalid stapled response, it will abort the connection. The only increased risk of OCSP stapling is that the notification of revocation for a certificate may be delayed until the last-signed OCSP response expires.|$|E
5000|$|OCSP stapling, {{formally}} {{known as}} the TLS Certificate <b>Status</b> <b>Request</b> extension, is an alternative approach to the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) for checking the revocation status of X.509 digital certificates. [...] It allows the presenter of a certificate to bear the resource cost involved in providing OCSP responses by appending ("stapling") a time-stamped OCSP response signed by the CA to the initial TLS handshake, {{eliminating the need for}} clients to contact the CA.|$|E

30|$|ZeroMQ {{provides}} the communication {{backbone of the}} Nanosurveyor infrastructure. Using the publisher–subscriber model for the core components enables Nanosurveyor to provide a load-balancing scheme, which uses a backlog queue to avoid losing data when sufficient resources are not be available. The execution pipeline creates a command port and a data port. The command port allows metadata to reach and update parameters as well as return responses to keep <b>status</b> <b>requests</b> alive and provide feedback on {{the current state of}} the running module. The data port moves data through the pipeline, running the actionable item within each module and moving the result to the output queue to be processed by the next stage of the pipeline.|$|R

The presence of these features on admissions’ Web sites was content analyzed. Admissions professionals rated a prospective student link, an online application, internal links, an online tour/visit registration, and active e-mail addresses as most important. Students rated application <b>status,</b> <b>requesting</b> information by a mailing address and e-mail, internal links, and a consistent main menu as most important. The most present features were links within the admissions site, graphics, links outside of the admissions site, active e-mail, and cookies.

Therefore, if we require continuous data, these two commands must be issued every 2  s to acquire the data set. It has become clear that incorrect STOP pulses were being detected at the lower threshold because of noise thought to originate from the analog–digital converter. Note that a lower threshold value compared to the value used for normal ranging near the asteroid was set so that faint laser pulses could be detected during the spacecraft scan in this experiment.|$|E
