40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} trends in <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use by age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, {{and type of}} <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> law. METHODS: We analyzed Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data on <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use from 33 states for 1987 through 1993 and used linear regression models to determine trends in prevalence. RESULTS: Asian/Pacific Islanders and Hispanics had the highest <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use among racial/ethnic groups. Prevalence varied little from age 25 through 64 years in all years, but averaged 25 percentage points higher in states with primary laws than in states with no <b>belt</b> laws. Overall <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use increased by an average 2. 7 +/- 0. 1 percentage points per year and varied little across most demographic groups, {{but there was no}} significant increase for Black males aged 18 through 29 years. CONCLUSIONS: The generally consistent increased in <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use across demographic groups is in sharp contrast to trends in other health-risk behaviors. States should enact primary <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> laws and focus <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use efforts towards young Black males...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Safety</b> <b>belt</b> use is 80 % nationally, {{yet only}} 63 % in Massachusetts. <b>Safety</b> <b>belt</b> use among {{potentially}} at-risk groups in Boston is unknown. We sought {{to assess the}} prevalence and correlates of belt non-use among emergency department (ED) patients in Boston. Methods A cross-sectional survey with systematic sampling was conducted on non-urgent ED patients age ≥ 18. A closed-ended survey was administered by interview. <b>Safety</b> <b>belt</b> use was defined via two methods: a single-item and a multiple-item measure of <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use. Each was scored using a 5 -point frequency scale. Responses were used to categorize <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use as 'always' or less than 'always'. Outcome for {{multivariate logistic regression analysis}} was <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use less than 'always'. Results Of 478 patients approached, 381 (80 %) participated. Participants were 48 % female, 48 % African-American, 40 % White, median age 39. Among participants, 250 (66 %) had been in a car crash; 234 (61 %) had a valid driver's license, and 42 (11 %) had been ticketed for belt non-use. Using two different survey measures, a single-item and a multiple-item measure, <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use 'always' was 51 % and 36 % respectively. According to separate regression models, factors associated with belt non-use included male gender, alcohol consumption > 5 drinks in one episode, riding with others that drink and drive, ever receiving a citation for belt non-use, believing that <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use is 'uncomfortable', and that 'I just forget', while 'It's my usual habit' was protective. Conclusion ED patients at an urban hospital in Boston have considerably lower self-reported <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use than state or national estimates. An ED-based intervention to increase <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use among this hard-to-reach population warrants consideration. </p...|$|R

Eby, Kostyniuk, & Vivoda 1 The {{main purpose of}} the present study was to explore the relationship between cellular phone and <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use. <b>Safety</b> <b>belt</b> use rates of drivers using and drivers not using hand-held cellular phones were compared. All <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> and hand-held cellular phone use data were collected through direct observation while vehicles were stopped at intersections and freeway exit ramps in Michigan. Data were weighted to be representative of drivers during daylight hours in Michigan. Analyses included statistical comparisons of <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use rates and a logistic regression model to determine the effect of hand-held cellular phone use on <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use. The study found that <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use for drivers using a hand-held cellular phone was significantly lower than for drivers not using cellular phones. This same significant relationship was found within nearly all demographic categories analyzed. The logistic regression model showed that the odds of a hand-held cellular phone user not using a <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> was 1. 77 times that of a driver not using a cellular phone. These results stress the importance of the public health issue posed by cellular phone use; not only are those who are conversing on cellular phones potentially more likely to be in a motor vehicle crash, they are also more likely to sustain greater injury due to the lack of <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use...|$|R

25|$|Another {{intervention}} study, conducted among U.S. and Canadian drivers, evaluated {{a device}} that prevents drivers from shifting vehicles into gear for up to 8 seconds unless <b>safety</b> <b>belts</b> are buckled. Participants were 101 commercial drivers who operated vans, pickups, and other light trucks. The driver could escape or avoid the delay by fastening his or her safety belt before shifting out of park. Unbelted participants experienced either a constant delay of 8 seconds, or a variable delay of 8 seconds on average. A 16-second delay was introduced for those U.S. drivers who did not show significant improvement. Safety belt use increased from 48% to 67% for U.S. drivers and from 54% to 74% for Canadian drivers.

25|$|NHTSA has {{produced}} models and guidance {{on the economic}} burden of traffic crashes on employers. Because public and private employers in the U.S. generally subsidize at least a portion of health insurance premium costs for employees and their dependents, employers bear some {{of the costs of}} crashes involving employees and families away from work in addition to at-work crashes. Employers are also liable for damages awarded in the courts for crashes for which employees are found to be at fault. In 1998-2000, motor vehicle crash injuries occurring on and off the job were estimated to cost employers nearly US $60 billion annually. On average, a fatality occurring on the job cost a business over $500,000 USD in direct and liability costs, and each nonfatal injury cost nearly $74,000 USDs. For on- and off-the-job crashes combined, the study estimated the cost of non-use of <b>safety</b> <b>belts</b> at more than $6 billion each year, and the cost of alcohol-related crashes at more than $9 billion each year.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{relevance}} of non-specific <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use data for interventions to rural teens and to pilot a data collection project to provide more specific data to traffic safety stakeholders and educators in rural areas. Methods: Twelve high schools in Southeast Georgia were used for observed <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> data collection over a 16 month period. Observational surveys were conducted at the entrance to student parking lots of the studied schools in the morning or afternoon. Observers were trained and survey methods were standardized to maintain comparability between results. Results: Observational surveys revealed a <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> usage rate of 38. 6 % among high schools teens at the studied high schools. <b>Safety</b> <b>belt</b> usage rates ranged from 9. 5 % to 66. 9 %. Observed <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use for female vehicle occupants was 48. 4 % compared to 35. 6 % for males. Conclusion: The observational survey results from this study support research showing that rural teens have lower <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> usage rates than adults or urban teens. Despite efforts to target rural areas, programs must specifically target sub populations, especially rural male teens, in order to hold any traction. Because of the wide gap between measured <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> use in rural Georgia (79. 9 %) and the studied rural high schools (38. 6 %), local program planners must assess actual <b>safety</b> <b>belt</b> usage in their high risk rural teen population in order to use accurate metrics for intervention and education efforts.
