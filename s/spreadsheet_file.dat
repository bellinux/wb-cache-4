50|$|Apache Forrest is a web-publishing {{framework}} {{based on}} Apache Cocoon. It is an XML single source publishing framework that allows multiple types of data-files as input, such as various popular word processing and <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>files,</b> {{as well as}} two wiki dialects. Plugins are available to support additional formats, both for input as well as output (such as PDF).|$|R
40|$|Spreadsheet use in {{educational}} environments has become widespread, likely {{because of the}} flexibility {{and ease of use}} of these tools. However, they have serious shortcomings if the teacher is to understand exactly what students or others have done. It is far too easy for students to replace a formula that gives an apparently unacceptable answer with a number that they believe to be correct. The same concern applies to recorded marks, as well as to business spreadsheets and to other reports that are used for decision-making. While intentionally misleading changes to <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>files</b> receive much attention, simple mistakes are probably more common. Some of these, such as the Trans-Alta Utilities (Globe and Mail, 2003) cut and paste error that cost the firm $ 24 million (US), have extreme consequences. Few are merely embarrassing. A log file or audit trail, enhanced by suitable filters, can allow both intentional and accidental changes that cause erroneous results to be caught. In order to meet these requirements, we have developed server based software tool (“TellTable”) which allows editing, version control, and auditing of <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>files.</b> Users connect to the server using a standard web browser, and are able to access and edit <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>files</b> in a Java applet in the browser window. TellTable has been used for a pilot study to maintain marks and course information for a multi-section courses with several instructions and teaching assistants. This paper describes the TellTable software and preliminary results of the pilot test...|$|R
50|$|MacLinkPlus Deluxe was a {{file format}} {{translation}} tool for PowerPC-era Mac OS X. It could convert and open files created for another operating system, or by programs {{that may not}} be available on the user's computer. Thus, it could open a Word or Excel file even if Microsoft Office was not installed. MacLink Plus supported, among others, word processing <b>files,</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>files,</b> database programs and graphic formats.|$|R
50|$|The DDM {{stream file}} model {{consists}} of file attributes, {{such as its}} creation date {{and the size of}} the stream and a continuous stream of bytes. The stream can be accessed by means of the Stream Access Method. Application programs write data onto portions of the stream, even if that data consists of records. They keep track of the location of data items in the stream in any way they want. For example, the data stream of document files is defined by a text processing program such as Microsoft Word and that of a <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>file</b> by a program such as Microsoft Excel.|$|E
5000|$|In most implementations, a cell, {{or group}} of cells in a column or row, can be [...] "named" [...] {{enabling}} the user to refer to those cells by a name rather than by a grid reference. Names must be unique within the spreadsheet, but when using multiple sheets in a <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>file,</b> an identically named cell range on each sheet can be used if it is distinguished by adding the sheet name. One reason for this usage is for creating or running macros that repeat a command across many sheets. Another reason is that formulas with named variables are readily checked against the algebra {{they are intended to}} implement (they resemble Fortran expressions). Use of named variables and named functions also makes the spreadsheet structure more transparent.|$|E
50|$|The REDCap {{software}} is distributed from Vanderbilt to institutional consortium partners, {{who in turn}} give research teams access to REDCap. REDCap project design has an intended workflow outlined by the developers. Upon request, the informatics core gives the research team a demonstration of REDCap, highlighting the most relevant user interface features. The researchers then fill out a Microsoft Excel <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>file</b> with key metadata (i.e. field name, data-type, data range, etc.) about each measurement in their CRF. The informatics core converts this spreadsheet template into study-specific database tables which are linked to a working web-based EDC forms and applications environment. The researchers then test this prototype web application by filling out dummy data, and the metadata spreadsheet is revised and refined in an iterative process. Once the REDCap project design is finalized, the application is deployed from development to production mode, all dummy data is lost, and researchers begin committing actual patient data.|$|E
