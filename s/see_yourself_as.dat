I have been interested in the concept of collaboration for many years. First, as a teacher, I quickly learned the value of collaboration with colleagues and worked hard to create my own networks and/or spaces for collaboration. I constantly sought opportunities to take advantage of working with other teachers around specific student issues or on school teams about school-wide problems. As my interest developed, I found myself wanting to work in collaboration with school staffs for program improvement. Ultimately, I sought a principalship in large part because I felt that leadership should be focused on empowering adults to work collaboratively for the benefit of all students, and I wanted to try and provide that kind of leadership. I truly believe that learning to work together toward “shared goals ” is more critical for our children and adults now than it has ever been. There is a special sense of “belongingness ” that comes when a group of people collectively accomplish a goal or task. It may be defined as “belonging for a purpose. ” Children and adults experience a growth in self worth as they work with others to make something positive happen in their world. I have learned that working together toward shared goals involves pain and struggle. Peopl...|$|R

Urie said [...] "It was a new start when Spencer Smith and I started writing, so it was gonna end up sounding different, sonically." [...] The music {{has been described as}} a combination of buzzsaw riffs, punchy percussion and literate, multi-layered lyrics. The song's title is, of course, an allusion to Mona Lisa, the famous Renaissance-era oil painting by Leonardo da Vinci. The painting inspired Panic!, which pulls their style from the nostalgic romanticism of the Elizabethan and Victorian eras. In a 2011 interview, Urie regarded the name and theme of the song as neither male nor female. “That whole thing with Mona Lisa was the idea that there is this character. For us, you look at the painting, and you can’t tell what this person is thinking. Not showing too much emotion, there’s this Mona Lisa smile masking what’s going on in that person’s head," [...] he explained. [...] "The song is about a battle in yourself … an inner struggle in oneself. The duality in nature, where you <b>see</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>as</b> a bad person, and the good person trying to correct your bad habits. That’s what it was about.

6000|$|... 135. And now I {{must state}} to you another {{principle}} of veracity, both in sculpture, and all following arts, of wider scope than any hitherto examined. We {{have seen that}} sculpture {{is to be a}} true representation of true external form. Much more is it to be a representation of true internal emotion. You must carve only what you <b>yourself</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> you see it; but, much more, you must carve only what you <b>yourself</b> feel, <b>as</b> you feel it. You may no more endeavour to feel through other men's souls, than to see with other men's eyes. Whereas generally now in Europe and America, every man's energy is bent upon acquiring some false emotion, not his own, but belonging to the past, or to other persons, because he has been taught that such and such a result of it will be fine. Every attempted sentiment in relation to art is hypocritical; our notions of sublimity, of grace, or pious serenity, are all second hand; and we are practically incapable of designing so much as a bell-handle or a door-knocker without borrowing the first notion of it from those who are gone--where we shall not wake them with our knocking.
