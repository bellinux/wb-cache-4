5000|$|<b>Strike</b> <b>plate</b> {{reinforcement}} {{can involve}} reinforcing the <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> and/or the door frame, {{to prevent the}} <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> from being rammed out of the frame.|$|E
50|$|A <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> is a {{metal plate}} affixed to a doorjamb {{with a hole}} or holes for the bolt of the door. When the door is closed, the bolt extends into {{the hole in the}} <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> and holds the door closed. The <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> protects the jamb against {{friction}} from the bolt and increases security {{in the case of a}} jamb made of a softer material (such as wood) than the <b>strike</b> <b>plate.</b> A plate on the lockset itself (on the door, not the jamb) is instead called a face plate.|$|E
5000|$|Dust Socket - A (nearly always) plastic socket {{that sits}} under the <b>Strike</b> <b>plate</b> concealing the rough {{wood of the}} mortise.|$|E
50|$|Hammermills are impact {{grinders}} with swinging or stationary steel bars forcing ingredients {{against a}} circular screen or solid serrated section {{designated as a}} <b>striking</b> <b>plate.</b> Material is held in the grinding chamber until it is reduced {{to the size of}} the openings in the screen. The number of hammers on a rotating shaft, their size, arrangement, sharpness, the speed of rotation, wear patterns, and clearance at the tip relative to the screen or <b>striking</b> <b>plate</b> are important variables in grinding capacity and the appearance of ground feed.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>strike</b> <b>plates</b> {{have their}} hole size and {{placement}} calculated so a spring-bolt extends into the hole, but an adjacent anti-retraction device remains depressed, preventing the bolt from being retracted unless the lock is turned.|$|R
50|$|Terry - Terry's door {{installation}} {{goes without}} a hitch, until {{he tries to}} close the shed door. It closes, but only from the inside (due to his <b>strike</b> <b>plates</b> not matching up), locking Terry inside his own shed.|$|R
5000|$|Deadlocking {{latchbolt}} (deadlatch) is an elaboration on the latchbolt {{which includes}} a guardbolt to prevent “shimming” or “jimmying” of the latch bolt. When the door is closed, the latchbolt and guardbolt are retracted together, and the door closes normally, with the latchbolt entering the <b>strike</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>strike</b> <b>plate,</b> however, holds the guardbolt in its depressed position: a mechanism within the lockset holds the latchbolt in the projected position. This arrangement prevents the latchbolt from being depressed {{through the use of}} a credit card or some other tool, which would lead to unauthorized entry.|$|E
50|$|A single-throw bolt. The bolt can {{be engaged}} in its <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> only after the door is closed. The locking {{mechanism}} typically prevents the bolt from being retracted by force.|$|E
5000|$|Vacuum arc {{remelting}} (VAR): This {{is done by}} striking {{an electrical}} arc between the raw material and a water-cooled copper <b>strike</b> <b>plate.</b> Melting is done in a high vacuum, and the mold itself is water-cooled copper.|$|E
50|$|Jeff - Footage {{was shown}} of Jeff's {{installation}} {{was limited to}} the use of a chisel to create recessions for the <b>strike</b> <b>plates,</b> although the door itself was later shown to be correct {{in the sense that it}} closes correctly (but was also incorrect in the sense that it was secured with only one or two screws per hinge).|$|R
60|$|Kipps {{examined}} {{these objects}} {{one by one}} and wished he knew more about them. Turning over the pages of the Physiology again he came upon a <b>striking</b> <b>plate</b> in which a youth of agreeable profile displayed his interior in an unstinted manner to the startled eye. It was a new view of humanity altogether for Kipps, and it arrested his mind.|$|R
5000|$|Bussemacher {{was active}} as an engraver, printer and art dealer in Cologne from about 1580 to 1613. His many works include several images of saints and a <b>striking</b> <b>plate</b> of Frau Richmuth Rising {{up from a}} Trance, taken from a wall {{painting}} once in the Church of the Apostles. Variations of his signature included [...] "Jans. Busse", [...] "J. Bussm.", [...] "Jo Buss", [...] "Johan Bussemec" [...] and [...] "I. Busem".|$|R
5000|$|The <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> next to {{the forward}} latch of Columbias {{external}} tank door was melted and distorted due to excess heat exposure during reentry. This heat was attributed to an improperly installed tile adjacent to the plate.|$|E
50|$|More {{expensive}} safe {{rooms have}} {{walls and a}} door reinforced with sheets of steel, Kevlar, or bullet-resistant fiberglass. The hinges and <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> are often reinforced with long screws. Some safe rooms may also have externally vented ventilation systems and a separate telephone connection. They might also connect to an escape shaft.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Strike</b> <b>plate</b> - A {{plate with}} a hole in the middle made to receive a bolt. If the strike is for a latchbolt, it {{typically}} also includes a small ramped area to help the bolt move inward while the door is being closed. (Also known as just [...] "strike") It's also available as electric strike which allows you to open the door even though the mechanical lock is locked.|$|E
50|$|From 1976 to 1979, the Hawkins was {{assigned}} as a Naval Reserve training ship in Philadelphia. By {{that time she}} was {{nearing the end of}} her designed lifespan. Science fiction writer James D. Macdonald, then a ensign in the United States Naval Reserve, {{was assigned}} to her during this period, and reported to the captain one morning that the sounding tape used to check the water level in the ship's tanks had punched through the <b>striking</b> <b>plate</b> in one of the sounding tubes and the hull plate beyond it, indicating the hull was becoming unsound.|$|R
25|$|At the Lavachicha site (municipality of Castrejón, Valladolid) {{several pieces}} of typical Roman pottery named terra sigillata hispanica have been {{unearthed}} {{and there was}} also an archaeological excavation in the 1980s that revealed a necropolis from late Roman times or, perhaps, from Visigothic times. Similar remains of late Roman pottery, have been found in Carpio (Valladolid), but only at ground level, and not from archaeological excavation. Another municipality crossed by the Trabancos River is Nava del Rey (a small town located in Valladolid), where, once again, are found superficial pieces of terra sigillata hispanica and a <b>striking</b> <b>plate</b> fragment with red gloss, resembling those that were carried by Roman legionaries on military campaigns.|$|R

5000|$|Results from {{intensive}} impact deformation testing {{have shown}} that EvoShield products disperse the force of impact better than EVA foam and hard plastic, the most common materials found in sports protection. The results, shown below, are measures of backface deformation. Backface deformation {{is the effect of}} a non-penetrating projectile on the rear face of a <b>strike</b> <b>plate.</b> It essentially measures how far an object is allowed to protrude against a protective surface. The extent of allowable deformation set by NIJ is 44 mm.” ...|$|E
50|$|A second {{option is}} wooden matches, but the smoker must ensure the {{chemical}} {{head of the}} match has burned away and only the burning wooden section is used to light the cigar. Depending on the manufacturer, the chemical head portion of the matchstick may contain {{one or more of}} the following: gelatin, paraffin wax, potassium chlorate, barium chlorate, glue, polyvinyl chlorides, phosphorus trisulfide, and clay. The <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> to ignite the match may contain one more of the following: glass particles, red phosphorus, and glue.|$|E
5000|$|Latchbolt or Latch bolt An {{extremely}} common latch type, typically {{part of a}} lockset, it is a spring-loaded bolt with an angled edge. When {{the door}} is pushed closed, the angled edge of the latchbolt engages with {{the lip of the}} strike plate; a spring allows the bolt to retract. Once the door is fully closed, the bolt automatically extends into the <b>strike</b> <b>plate,</b> holding the door closed. The latchbolt is disengaged (retracted) typically when the user turns the door handle, which via the lockset's mechanism, manually retracts the latchbolt, allowing the door to open.|$|E
5000|$|The {{plate is}} visualized. As some plates are {{pre-coated}} with a phosphor such as zinc sulfide, allowing many compounds to be visualized by using ultraviolet light; dark spots appear where the compounds block the UV light from <b>striking</b> the <b>plate.</b> Alternatively, plates can be sprayed or immersed in chemicals after elution. Various visualising agents react with the spots to produce visible results.|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{dependence}} of power balance on input power, shape, and plasma current was conducted for neutral-beam-heated plasmas in the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX). Measurements of heat to the divertor <b>strike</b> <b>plates</b> and divertor and core radiation were taken {{over a wide range}} of plasma conditions. The different conditions were obtained by inducing a L-mode to H-mode transition, changing the divertor configuration [lower single null (LSN) vs. double-null (DND) ] and conducting a NBI power scan in H-mode. 60 - 70 % of the net input power is accounted for in the LSN discharges with 20 % of power lost as fast ions, 30 - 45 % incident on the divertor plates, up to 10 % radiated in the core, and about 12 % radiated in the divertor. In contrast, the power accountability in DND is 85 - 90 %. A comparison of DND and LSN data show that the remaining power in the LSN is likely to be directed to the upper diverto...|$|R
40|$|In {{the near}} future the {{interior}} materials of JET will be changed to a beryllium wall and tungsten divertor so as to resemble the ITER design. Initially {{there will be no}} carbon <b>strike</b> <b>plates</b> in the divertor but there is the possibility of adding these later for an exact match. Such a change requires upgraded spectroscopic diagnostics in order to measure the spatially dependent influx of these impurities and their concentrations in the confined plasma. With 74 ionization stages (many of them very complex) the high Z of tungsten also places new demands on the atomic physics required to model its behavior which in turn informs the design of potential diagnostic systems. Modeled emission patterns from the upgraded JET are used as part of the diagnostic specification. We describe a suite of spectroscopic diagnostics in the visible, extreme ultraviolet, vacuum ultraviolet, and x-ray spectral regions suitable for these tasks.

50|$|The parts {{included}} in the typical US mortise lock installation are the lock body (the part installed inside the mortise cut-out in the door); the lock trim (which may be selected from any number of designs of doorknobs, levers, handle sets and pulls); a <b>strike</b> <b>plate,</b> or a box keep, which lines {{the hole in the}} frame into which the bolt fits; and the keyed cylinder which operates the locking/unlocking function of the lock body. However, in the United Kingdom, and most other countries, mortise locks on dwellings do not use cylinders, but have lever mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|A lockset (alternatively lock set) is the {{hardware}} and components {{that make up}} the locking or latching mechanism that can usually be found on a door or other hinged object but can also include sliding doors and dividers.The components of a lockset can include (but are not limited to) the door handles (commonly both inside and outside), latchbolt, dead bolt, face plate, <b>strike</b> <b>plate,</b> escutcheon, thumbturn, push button, turn button, and other trim. The lockset and associated hardware typically defines a door's function and how a user could (or could not) access the two adjacent spaces defined by the opening associated with the lockset.|$|E
50|$|The RSM {{in command}} of the FSB joined in the action, he brought forward the CO's HQ team to {{reinforce}} A Sqn when he believed the assault was stalling, they were several hundred meters from the enemy positions when he was shot in the leg by an AK-47 round, making him the second SAS soldier to be wounded. Several SAS soldiers were prevented from getting inured and/or killed by their body armour and helmets (they were equipped with MSA MICH TC-2000 helmets and Blackhawk Industries <b>STRIKE</b> <b>plate</b> carrier body armour-most disliked wearing the helmets and allegedly had to be ordered to do so). Eventually, the A Sqn assault force reached the objective, using their Maglite torches on their weapons they cleared the caves, in one cave they found 3 fighters sleeping, who were killed when they started scrambling for their weapons, they also cleared the HQ building, gathering all intelligence materials they could find. More fighters closed in on the SAS assault force who were then engaged by SAS snipers as both sides were now too close for air support to be called in, after 2 hours and finally mopping up the last remnants of al-Qaeda fighters at the facility, the objective had been cleared. In the al-Qaeda HQ, A Sqn members found an intelligence bounty- two laptops and a mass of paperwork with information. The mission lasted 4 hours and a total of 4 SAS operators were wounded, both squadrons withdrew and rendezvoused with a US CH-47 Chinook to extract their wounded, whilst the rest were extracted by C-130 Hercules from a TLZ (Temporary Landing Zone).|$|E
5000|$|COFC (container on flat car) {{cars are}} {{typically}} 89 ft long and carry four 20 ft intermodal containers or two 40 ft/45 ft shipping containers (the two 45 ft containers are carryable {{due to the}} fact that the car is actually 92 ft long, over the <b>strike</b> <b>plates).</b> With the rise of intermodal freight transport-specific cars, and given the age of most of these flats, numbers will decline over the next several years. Indeed, when the first well cars appeared, allowing double stacking, many container flats were re-built as autoracks. The few [...] "new build" [...] container flats are identifiable by their lack of decking, welded steel frame, and standard 89 ft length. One variant is the 50 ft car (which usually carries one large container as a load); these are actually re-built old boxcars. Common reporting marks are FEC, CP, SOO and KTTX. The ATTX cars, which feature non-sparking grips and sides, are built for hauling dangerous goods (ammunition, flammable fluids, etc.).|$|R
40|$|Future fusion reactors, like ITER, {{will rely}} on an active exhaust system to pump tritium (T) in the {{divertor}} and then recirculate it to the fuel stream. Estimation of the T inventory requires a detailed T balance, which determines if T is preferentially enriched relative to D in its pathway from the main plasma to the divertor and pump. On the Joint European Torus (JET), the neutral T concentration in the sub-divertor (pumping plenum and region below the divertor <b>strike</b> point <b>plate)</b> is measured with a modified Penning gauge coupled to a high-resolution spectrometer. In addition, T concentration measurements {{are made in the}} plasma edge and strike point region with a spectrometer viewing these regions. The sub-divertor and divertor (region above the <b>strike</b> point <b>plate)</b> T concentration measurements show differences during initial T uptake and retention which are characteristic of wall deposition properties. Since wall retention is one of the factors in calculating the eventual T inventory in a reactor, a detailed study of this process has been undertaken. I...|$|R
60|$|A {{couple of}} tables were put {{together}} {{in the middle of}} the parlour, covered with three or four cloths of different ages and dates of washing, arranged to look as much like one as the circumstances of the case would allow. Upon these were laid knives and forks for six or eight people. Some of the knife handles were green, others red, and a few yellow; and as all the forks were black, the combination of colours was exceedingly <b>striking.</b> <b>Plates</b> for a corresponding number of guests were warming behind the fender; and the guests themselves were warming before it: the chief and most important of whom appeared to be a stoutish gentleman in a bright crimson coat with long tails, vividly red breeches, and a cocked hat, who was standing with his back to the fire, and had apparently just entered, for besides retaining his cocked hat on his head, he carried in his hand a high stick, such as gentlemen of his profession usually elevate in a sloping position over the roofs of carriages.|$|R
40|$|Bird strikes are {{a common}} problem for the {{aerospace}} industry and can cause serious damage to an aircraft. Ballistic gelatin is frequently used as a surrogate for actual bird carcasses in bird strike tests. Numerical simulations of these tests are used to supplement experimental data, therefore {{it is necessary to}} use numerical modeling techniques that can accurately capture the dynamic response of ballistic gelatin. An experimental technique is introduced to validate these modeling techniques. A ballistic gelatin projectile is fired into a <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> attached to a 36 in. long sensor tube. Dynamic load is measured at two locations relative to the <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> using strain gages configured in a full Wheatstone bridge. Data from these experiments are used to validate a gelatin constitutive model. Simulations of the apparatus are analyzed to investigate its performance...|$|E
40|$|An {{electromagnetic}} attachment {{mechanism for}} use as an end effector of a remote manipulator system. A pair of electromagnets 15 A, 15 B, each with a U-shaped magnetic core with a pull-in coil 34 and two holding coils 35, 36 are mounted by a spring suspension system 38, 47 on a base plate 25 of the mechanism housing 30 with end pole pieces 21, 22 adapted to move through openings in the base plate when the attractive force of the electromagnets is exerted on a <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> 65 of a grapple fixture 20 affixed to a target object 14. The pole pieces are spaced by an air gap from the <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> when the mechanism first contacts the grapple fixture. An individual control circuit and power source is provided for the pull-in coil and one holding coil of each electromagnet. A back-up control circuit connected to the two power sources and a third power source is provided for the remaining holding coils. When energized, the pull-in coils overcome the suspension system and air gap and are automatically de-energized when the pole pieces move to grapple and impose a preload force across the grapple interface. A battery back-up 89 A, 89 B is a redundant power source for each electromagnet in each individual control circuit and is automatically connected upon failure of the primary power source.

40|$|In a magnetically {{diverted}} tokamak, the scrape-off layer (SOL) and divertor plasma provides {{separation between}} the first wall and the core plasma, intercepting impurities generated at the wall {{before they reach the}} core plasma. The divertor plasma can also serve to spread the heat and particle flux over a large area of divertor structure wall using impurity radiation and neutral charge exchange, thus reducing peak heat and particle fluxes at the divertor <b>strike</b> <b>plate.</b> Such a reduction will be required in the next generation of tokamaks, for without it, the divertor engineering requirements are very demanding. To successfully demonstrate a radiative divertor, a highly radiative condition with significant volume recombination must be achieved in the divertor, while maintaining a low impurity content in the core plasma. Divertor plasma properties are determined by a complex interaction of classical parallel transport, anomalous perpendicular transport, impurity transport and radiation, and plasma wall interaction. In this paper the authors describe a set of experiments on DIII-D designed to provide detailed two dimensional documentation of the divertor and SOL plasma. Measurements have been made in operating modes where the plasma is attached to the divertor <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> and in highly radiating cases where the plasma is detached from the divertor <b>strike</b> <b>plate.</b> They also discuss the results of experiments designed to influence the distribution of impurities in the plasma using enhanced SOL plasma flow. Extensive modeling efforts will be described which are successfully reproducing attached plasma conditions and are helping to elucidate the important plasma and atomic physics involved in the detachment process...|$|E
