40|$|A {{large signal}} {{stability}} {{analysis of the}} <b>solar</b> array <b>regulator</b> system is performed to facilitate the design and analysis of a Low-Earth-Orbit satellite power system. The effective load characteristics of every controllable method in the <b>solar</b> array <b>regulator</b> system, such as the constant power load, variable power load, constant voltage load, constant current load, and constant resistive load, are classified to analyze the large signal stability. Then, using the state plane analysis technique, the large signal behavior of the solar array system is portrayed and the stability of various equilibrium points is analyzed. Thus, this approach can be contributed to organize the optimal controller structure of the system by representing {{the relationship between the}} control method of the <b>solar</b> array <b>regulator</b> and the large signal stability.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the design, implementation, {{and testing of}} a buck converter with peak power tracking. The peak power tracker uses a perturb and observe algorithm to actively track the solar panel's peak power point and a global sweep algorithm accounts for startup and multiple local maxima. The tracker {{takes the place of}} the current mode loop in the converter's control scheme by providing a battery with peak charging current. A voltage mode loop is also designed to take over control from the tracker to complete the multi-loop structure. A solar panel simulator is designed to mimic the characteristics of an actual solar panel to allow careful testing of the tracking algorithms. A test circuit board is built and its operation is verified. Finally, the power extracting potential of the active tracking method from this thesis is compared to two simpler <b>solar</b> <b>regulators.</b> by Jeremy Michael Cohen. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|A {{satellite}} {{power system}} should generate and supply sufficient electric power {{to perform the}} satellite mission successfully during the satellite mission period, {{and it should be}} developed to be strong to the failure caused by the severe space environment. A satellite power system must have a high reliability with respect to failure. Since it cannot be repaired after launching, different from a ground system, the failures that may happen in space as well as the effect of the failures on the system should be considered in advance. However, it is difficult to use all the hardware to test the performance of the satellite power system to be developed in order to consider the failure mechanism of the electrical power system. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an accurate model for the main components of a power system and, based on that, to develop an accurate model for the entire power system. Through the power system modeling, the overall effect of failure on the main components of the power system can be considered and the protective design can be devised against the failure. In this study, to analyze the failure mode of the power system and the effects of the failure on the power system, we carried out modeling of the main power system components including the <b>solar</b> array <b>regulator,</b> and constituted the entire power system based on the modeling. Additionally, we investigated the effects of representative failures in the <b>solar</b> array <b>regulator</b> on the power system using the power system model...|$|R

40|$|In {{the design}} of a power converter, the maximum output voltage {{transient}} under load change {{is one of the main}} drivers. The ECSS-E-ST- 20 C imposes specific requirements on the power quality of a regulated bus, which result most of the time in the use of a large capacitor bank to cope with the linear loop dynamics. Moreover, this sometimes results in slow dynamic response. In this paper a combined linear and non-linear control applied to a buck converter is proposed. This control technique enhances the transient performance with a faster recovery time and allows smaller output filter capacitors to be used. The proposed control is a combination of a linear control based on a conductance control principle, and a non-linear control, which intervenes only during transients. The latter is based on the detection of the output voltage variation and on the immediate application of maximum or minimum inductor current, as consequence of voltage undershoot or overshoot. Once the controlled output voltage is within the allowed range, the linear control takes back the voltage regulation control. The buck converter is chosen as a reference topology since most of the current <b>solar</b> array <b>regulators</b> (SARs) use a buck or super buck topology. Most Battery Discharge Regulators (BDRs) are also based on buckderived topologies. This concept can find application in the three-domain regulated bus control...|$|R

The solar charge station is constructed on Classrooms Building in Engineering Faculty of Izmir Institute of Technology. Sixteen monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic modules having the dimensions of 1. 293 mx 0. 329 mx 0. 034 m and 55 W power rating are used as the photovoltaic generator of the solar charge station. Modules are mounted as if they create an. Omega Shape. which gives its name to the station (Omega Type Solar Charge Station). Vertical and tilted reflectors are used to enhance the electricity generation. Generated electricity is used to charge a lead acid battery, which is protected by five <b>solar</b> charge <b>regulators</b> in order to prevent discharging and overcharging. 50 W halogen lamps working with direct current are chosen as the loads.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this thesis, the design of a {{femtosecond}} Ti:Sapphire laser oscillator and laser amplification system including stretcher, multipass amplifier, and compressor is described, with particular attention to the dispersion compensation of the laser amplification system. In addition, the design of an achromatic degenerate third order autocorrelator is presented as it represents an important tool for evaluating the quality of the laser pulses. In the second part, the ultrafast optical spectroscopic properties of several carotenoids were studied. Carotenoids are comprised of two subgroups, xanthophylls and carotenes, and play numerous important roles in nature. These studies seek to unravel the complex photophysics of the molecules and discover the mechanism by which they function as harvesters of <b>solar</b> energy and <b>regulators</b> of energy flow in photosynthesis. Three xanthophylls, violaxanthin, lutein, and zeaxanthin; five open-chain carotenoids, neurosporene, spheroidene, rhodopin glucoside, rhodovibrin, and spirilloxanthin; and four light-harvesting pigment-protein complexes, denoted LH 2 complexes, prepared from four different strains of photosynthetic bacteria, Rhodobacter (Rb.) sphaeroides GIC containing neurosporene, Rb. sphaeroides 2. 4. 1 (anaerobically grown) containing spheroidene, Rb. sphaeroides 2. 4. 1 (aerobically grown) containing spheroidenone, and Rps. acidophila 10050 containing rhodopin glucoside were studied. Experiments employed steady-state absorption, fluorescence, fluorescence excitation and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out immediately prior to the spectroscopic experiments to obtain highly pure molecules of the xanthophylls and open-chain carotenoids. Column chromatography using DEAE Sephacel (Sigma-Aldrich) of protein extracts from the bacteria was carried out to purify the LH 2 complexes. Ultrafast optical spectroscopic experiments on the xanthophlylls were carried out at cryogenic temperatures in ether/isopentane/ethanol (EPA) glasses which provided enhanced spectral resolution compared to room temperature studies previously done. Methods of global fitting analysis were developed to analyze the spectral and temporal datasets. The data were found to be consistent with a model partitioning energy flow among various excited states including S 1 (11 A g-), vibronically excited S 1 (11 A g-), S 2 (11 Bu +) and the nebulous, S*. The spectral properties of the all- trans open-chain carotenoids were investigated in acetone and CS 2 solution at room temperature to explore the effect of solvent and in EPA glasses at 77 K, using steady-state absorption and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy in the visible region. The data support a model for S* as an excited state having a twisted conformational structure, the yield of which was increased in molecules having elongated systems of π-electron conjugation. The experiments were backed up by theoretical quantum computations done by Professor Robert Birge as a collaborator. Steady-state absorption, fluorescence, fluorescence excitation, and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy in both the visible and near-infrared (NIR) regions were carried out on LH 2 complexes containing carotenoids with systematically increasing numbers of π-electron conjugated double-double bonds. One goal of this part of the work is to explain the structural features of carotenoids that control the rate and efficiency of energy transfer from carotenoids to bacteriochlorophyll in photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes. ...|$|R
