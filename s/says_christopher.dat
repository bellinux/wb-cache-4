The group is also asking for the demolition of the toll plazas and for future operation of the former Toll Road as a free public highway. [...] "Route 267 is the only full time tolled highway in the DC area and has been fully paid for," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Christopher</b> W. Walker, founder of the Group. [...] "It is not a cash cow for Dulles Rail, a subsidy for Dulles Airport, nor a source for upgrading western and southern access to Dulles, as the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority intends.

5000|$|Meanwhile, Tony's entire crew, {{including}} Uncle Junior, play an unintentional game of [...] "telephone" [...] {{with the}} story of the accident. The details get more elaborate and lurid with each retelling. The FBI gets wind of the story and believes the distorted version of an affair. Christopher has become a laughing stock. When Christopher goes to Satriale's, he sees Vito Spatafore and some others laughing over the story. Christopher, having only heard the laughter and wanting to know what the joke was about, becomes frustrated over the crew's subsequent evasiveness. Christopher bursts into a rage and throws his sandwich at Vito, a major faux pas since Vito is now a capo. Vito gets up to retaliate but is restrained by the others. Later, Christopher shows up at home and angrily confronts Adriana and chokes her. He has heard the distorted story about Adriana's being caught performing fellatio on Tony by the EMTs, and believes it was the reason for the accident. When he assaults her and chokes her again, she admits that she and Tony were going to see her drug dealer, but insists that nothing happened between them. Christopher then beats her and drags her by the hair out of the apartment, saying that he never wants to see her again. Seconds later, he relapses by guzzling vodka straight out of the bottle after rifling through Adriana's purse for drugs. Later, Tony Blundetto warns Tony that Christopher was drunk at the Belleville Tavern and was talking loudly about the situation. Tony <b>says</b> <b>Christopher</b> knows where to find him and tells Tony B to tell Christopher that if he sees him.|$|E

The paper pursues three major goals. First, it delves into the maze of Shanghai memory embedded in this novel, which is typically formulated by two contrasting aspects: Christopher Banks 2 ̆ 7 s naïve and beautiful childhood memory of Shanghai, and his unhappy adulthood memory of it. Second, it explores how memory plays a dual function of deception and decoration. That is to <b>say,</b> <b>Christopher</b> deliberately uses his memory to create positive images of female characters and to build up negative images of male characters, which makes both of them look deceptively true. Third, it proceeds to discuss the central issue of 2 ̆ 2 orphanhood 2 ̆ 2 suggested by the title of novel, specifically considering how the notion 2 ̆ 2 orphan 2 ̆ 2 is reconfigured by both Christopher 2 ̆ 7 s memory and Ishiguro 2 ̆ 7 s conception of 2 ̆ 2 unprotectedness. 2 ̆...|$|R

5000|$|Little {{is known}} about the life of Christopher; the lack of reliable, {{consistent}} sources make it difficult to establish a concise biography. It is believed that he was a Roman, and that his father's name was Leo. He was cardinal-priest of the title of St. Damasus when he became Pope. His predecessor, Leo V, was deposed and imprisoned, most likely around October 903. As it is believed that Leo died in prison, Christopher may be regarded as Pope after his death. However, the account of Auxilius of Naples says that Sergius III murdered both Leo V and Christopher. An eleventh-century Greek document <b>says</b> that <b>Christopher</b> was the first pope to state that the Holy Ghost proceeded [...] "from the Father and from the Son." [...] However, the document claims that Christopher made this profession to Sergius, Patriarch of Constantinople. At that time, however, Nicholas Mystikos was Patriarch of Constantinople, making the account historically suspect. (Sergius I was Patriarch in 610-638, and Sergius II in 1001-1019.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Morello was a {{recurring}} character {{for the first}} and second seasons of Orange Is the New Black. In March 2014, series creator Jenji Kohan said Morello's backstory would be revealed in the second season. While Stone commented there would be some [...] "pretty hard hitting truths coming out" [...] and that she was amazed at what happens to her character. The episode, titled [...] "A Whole Other Hole", revealed that Morello's often mentioned fiancé, Christopher MacLaren (Stephen O'Reilly), was not actually her fiancé and she had been incarcerated for stalking and terrorizing him. Stone learned the truth about Morello's backstory the day she got the script for the episode. Prior to that, she had imagined her own version of Morello's history, believing that she might have committed an assault or been charged for the mail fraud. Stone pointed out that there had been some hints that Morello was not telling the truth during previous episodes, including Nicky mentioning that Christopher had not been to visit and Morello's sister, Francine (Kristen Sieh), calling her to <b>say</b> that <b>Christopher</b> was getting married.|$|R
