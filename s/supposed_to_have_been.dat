5|$|In Tlingit and Haida cultures, raven {{was both}} a trickster and creator god. Related beliefs are {{widespread}} among the peoples of Siberia and northeast Asia. The Kamchatka Peninsula, for example, was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> created by the raven god Kutkh. There are several references to common ravens in the Old Testament of the Bible {{and it is an}} aspect of Mahakala in Bhutanese mythology.|$|E
5|$|Andersen {{was accused}} of crimes on several {{occasions}} in the post-war years, but was most often acquitted in court. Amongst the crimes {{of which he was}} charged but acquitted in court was the theft of building materials in 1954. Another time he was tricked into lending his car to two people who broke into a goldsmith's shop in Tønsberg. Strongly intoxicated {{at the time of the}} crime, he was charged but fully acquitted. In 1955 he was, however, convicted and sentenced to 36days in prison for selling 30bottles of denatured alcohol, alcohol that was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used at his factory.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{a little}} after noon Wilton arrived at the inquest, and gave a full account of the incident. Lord Granville (half-brother of the Marquess of Stafford) told the jury that Huskisson had been {{suffering}} from numbness in his leg from a previous operation, and that this may have caused his apparent problems with movement. No witnesses recollected seeing any signal flags raised {{from any of the}} locomotives involved, including Rocket, although a system of warning flags was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in place.|$|E
50|$|In a funny way, {{the song}} <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>been</b> {{recorded}} in a submarine {{while it was}} at 300 metres of deep. Dvorjak, Olaff and Piotr, who are indicated as writers and composers of the song, are actually the singers under a pseudonym. All three appear bare buttocks {{on the back of}} the single cover.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Shalit ben Eliezer Riqueti (Richetti) was a Jewish-Italian scholar born at Safed, and {{who lived}} {{in the second half of}} the 17th century at Verona, where he {{directed}} a Talmudical school. He was the author of Ḥokmat ha-Mishkan or Iggeret Meleket ha-Mishkan (Mantua, 1676), on the construction of the First Temple. He also published a map of Palestine which Zunz <b>supposes</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> prepared as one of the illustrations of a Passover Haggadah.|$|R
50|$|On February 15, 1945, Mundy {{was sent}} to Hamilton Army Airfield where he became {{operations}} and training staff officer of the XXI Bomber Command. In March {{of the same year}} he was named commanding officer of the 39th Bomb Group of Andersen Air Force Base. During that time, he flew fourteen missions on City of Galveston aircraft along with John Miranda's squadron against Nagoya. After the war, he and Miranda were honored with Silver Stars, and Miranda even was promoted to lead crew commander even though he <b>suppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> punished by Mundy for misconduct with military personnel.|$|R
5|$|In 1797, Emerald was one {{of several}} vessels sent to hunt down and capture the {{crippled}} Santisima Trinidad, which had escaped from the British at the Battle of Cape St Vincent. Emerald was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> present at the Battle of the Nile but in May 1798 a storm separated her from Horatio Nelson's squadron and she arrived in Aboukir Bay nine days too late. She was part of Rear-Admiral John Thomas Duckworth's squadron during the Action of 7 April 1800 off Cadiz.|$|E
5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943–44. Three turbines were delivered by Brown Boveri in 1939 to Arkhangelsk for the Sovetskaya Rossiya, but the Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. A prototype boiler was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> built ashore for evaluation, {{but it was not}} completed until early 1941, which further complicated the production plan.|$|E
5|$|The manga was {{licensed}} for English-language distribution by ADV Manga, which released five volumes between 2005 and 2007. Volume six was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{released in}} February 2008, but was delayed indefinitely {{in order to}} focus on ADV's core business of anime. At New York Comic Con 2009, Yen Press announced that it had acquired the North American license for the series; it reprinted the first five volumes with new translations along with volume six in September 2009, and is continuing with later volumes.|$|E

50|$|Tiran may be {{the island}} that Procopius called Iotabe (in Ἰωτάβη), which was an {{important}} toll station for shipping in the area, but other islands in the Gulf of Aqaba <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proposed as alternative identifications. In 473 a Saracen named Amorkesos captured the island and appropriated the revenues, but the Byzantine Empire retook it 25 years later, granting its inhabitants autonomy, subject to payment of taxes on goods exported to India. Around 534, the Byzantines <b>had</b> <b>to</b> retake it again from a group whom Choricius of Gaza called an unholy race, and whom some scholars <b>suppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the Jewish inhabitants who <b>had</b> refused <b>to</b> pay the taxes.|$|R
25|$|According {{to another}} theory, {{the name is}} a {{corruption}} of two words which mean the Friars’ Hill; those who favour this idea allege that St. Ninian, by planting a religious house near the head {{of what is now}} the Friars’ Vennel, {{at the close of the}} fourth century, became the virtual founder of the Burgh; however Ninian, so far as is known, did not originate any monastic establishments anywhere and was simply a missionary. In the list of British towns given by the ancient historian Nennius, the name Caer Peris occurs, which some modern antiquarians <b>suppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> transmuted, by a change of dialect, into Dumfries.|$|R
5|$|Monica begins dating Dr. Richard Burke (Tom Selleck), {{an older}} man who {{is also one of}} her father's best friends and 21 years her senior. However, the couple {{mutually}} agrees to end their long-running relationship after realizing that Richard does not want children, while Monica aspires to eventually raise a family of her own one day. While in England attending Ross' second wedding, to Emily (Helen Baxendale), Monica sleeps with Chandler. Initially <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a casual, one-time thing which grew more recurrent, Monica and Chandler eventually develop feelings for each other, but attempt to conceal it from their friends for as long as possible. After finally revealing their relationship to their friends, who are delighted by the news, Monica proposes to Chandler, and they marry.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, 2007, six AGM-129 ACM cruise missiles, each {{loaded with}} a W80-1 {{variable}} yield nuclear warhead, were mistakenly loaded onto a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52H heavy bomber at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and transported to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The nuclear warheads in the missiles were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> removed before the missiles {{were taken from}} their storage bunker. The missiles with the nuclear warheads were not reported missing, and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for 36 hours. During this period, the warheads were not protected by the various mandatory security precautions for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Parachute Brigade had a {{secondary}} objective of capturing Le Muy. It was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> assaulted by the 4th Parachute Battalion with the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion providing fire support. With the forces {{he had at}} hand, Pritchard was unable {{to carry out the}} task. The objective was then given to the 550th Glider Infantry Battalion, which had arrived with the second wave of aircraft. At 02:15 16 August the American battalion moved through the British positions and assaulted the village. The village was defended in strength by the Germans and the attack failed, causing several casualties to the Americans. A second attempt at 11:40 was more successful, killing or wounding 300 Germans and taking 700 prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|... "By Malachi": literally, by {{the hand}} of Malachi (comp. Jeremiah 37:2). Malachi is the proper name of the prophet, and not a mere {{official}} designation. The LXX. renders, ἐν χειρὶ ἀγγέλου αὐτοῦ, [...] "{{by the hand}} of his angel," [...] or" [...] messenger," [...] and some curious theories <b>have</b> <b>been</b> founded on this translation; e.g. that an angel was the real author of the book, or came and explained it to the people. A similar legend once obtained concerning Haggai, called" [...] The Lord's Messenger" [...] (Haggai 1:13). At {{the end of the}} verse the LXX. adds, [...] "fix it in your hearts," [...] which Jerome <b>supposes</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> imported hither from Haggai 2:15.|$|R

A cross in memory of York's son, Rutland, was erected at the Park Street end of Kirkgate in Wakefield.|$|R
5000|$|Aggenus Urbicus was {{an ancient}} Roman {{technical}} writer {{on the science}} of the Agrimensores, that is, land surveying. [...] It is uncertain when he lived; but he appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a Christian, {{and it is not}} improbable from some expressions which he uses, that he lived at {{the latter part of the}} 4th century. [...] There are three extant works ascribed to him. Aggeni Urbici in Julium Frontinum Commentarius, a commentary upon the work De Agrorum Qualitate, which is ascribed to Frontinus. Aggenus' commentary was not well regarded by later writers; Karl Lachmann called it [...] "the wretched work of some Christian schoolmaster". [...] The other two works are In Julium Frontinum Commentariorum Liber secundus qui Diazographus dicitur; and Commentariorum de Controversiis Agrorum Pars prior et altera. The latter of which Carsten Niebuhr <b>supposes</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> actually been written by Frontinus, and in the time of Domitian, that is, the end of the 1st century, since the author speaks of [...] "praestantissimus Domitianus," [...] an expression which some feel would <b>be</b> unlikely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> applied <b>to</b> this tyrant after his death.|$|R
5|$|The Bundeswehr {{gave the}} {{remaining}} border guards and other ex-NVA soldiers {{the task of}} clearing the fortifications, which was completed only in 1994. The scale of the task was immense, involving both the clearing of the fortifications and the rebuilding of hundreds of roads and railway lines. A serious complication was the presence of mines along the border. Although the 1.4million mines laid by the GDR were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> removed during the 1980s, {{it turned out that}} 34,000 were unaccounted for. A further 1,100mines were found and removed following reunification at a cost of more than DM250million, in a programme that was not concluded until the end of 1995.|$|E
5|$|This {{station was}} not {{intended}} to be the terminus of the Concourse Line or the D train; both tracks were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> extended east past Bronx Park and the IRT White Plains Road Line along Burke Avenue to serve the northeast section of the Bronx. This idea was postponed due to lack of funding, and ultimately abandoned when the City of New York bought the right-of-way of the bankrupt New York, Westchester and Boston Railway and converted it for subway use in 1941. Another proposal in the 1970s involved extending the Concourse Line to White Plains Road, but financial troubles caused the plan to be aborted.|$|E
5|$|With the Mongol {{invasion}} of Rus' by Batu Khan in 1237-40, the monastery is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> completely destroyed. These legends were written down much later. The monastery {{is known to}} have existed in the 14th century, though. In 1482, it was attacked by the Crimean Tatars under Meñli I Giray. Reconstruction on the monastery began only 40 years later. In 1523, the monastery was transferred to the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund I. In addition, the monastery was given a full reign over its territory. In 1555, the complex consisted of four churches, including and one cave church.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} explanation suggested {{during the}} early nineteenth century, was that the name might be derived from an Etruscan root, Pumpu or Pumpili. [...] In her History of Etruria, Mrs. Hamilton Gray <b>supposed</b> Pumpu <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the name of Numa's mother, adopted as a surname according to a tradition common to the Etruscan and Sabine cultures.|$|R
50|$|The body of {{buildings}} measured {{in excess of}} one hundred and sixty five feet from east to west, and in some places up to two hundred and ten feet from north to south. The South Battery, which Grose <b>supposes</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the citadel or keep, is situated on a detached perpendicular rock, only accessible on one side, seventy two feet high, and {{is connected to the}} main part of the castle by a passage of masonry measuring sixty nine feet. The interior of the citadel measures fifty four feet by sixty within the walls. Its shape is octagonal. Five of the gun-ports remain, which are called the 'arrow-holes'. They measure four feet at the mouth and only sixteen inches at the other end. The buildings are arched and extend eight feet from the outer walls, and look into an open court, whence they derive their light.|$|R

5|$|At 05:45, Lieutenant-Colonel Mehmet Sefik of the Turkish 27th Infantry Regiment {{received}} {{orders to}} move his 1st and 3rd Battalions {{to the west and}} support the 2nd Battalion around Gaba Tepe. The two battalions were already assembled, having spent that night carrying out military exercises. They could not be sent to Ari Burnu as it was not marked on the Turkish maps. Colonel Halil Sami, commanding the 9th Division, also ordered the division's machine-gun company and an artillery battery to move in support of the 27th Infantry Regiment, followed soon after by an 77mm artillery battery. At 08:00 Lieutenant-Colonel Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division, was ordered to send a battalion to support them. Kemal instead decided to go himself with the 57th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battery towards Chunuk Bair, which he realised was the key point in the defence; whoever held those heights would dominate the battlefield. By chance, the 57th Infantry were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> on an exercise that morning around Hill 971 and had been prepared since 05:30, waiting for orders.|$|E
5|$|By tradition, Anna {{is said to}} {{have had}} a fourth daughter, Wihtburh, an abbess at Dereham (or {{possibly}} West Dereham), where there was a royal double monastery. She may never have existed: Bede fails to mention her and she first appears in a calendar in the late 10th century Bosworth Psalter. She may have been a character specifically created by the religious community at Ely, where her remains were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> taken after being stolen from Dereham and subsequently used as visual proof of the incorruptibility of a saint's body, a substitute for her sister Æthelthryth, whose body had to remain unexamined in her tomb. Manuscript F of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which dates from about 1100, mentions Wihtburh's death when it records that her body was found uncorrupted in 798, 55 years after she died. The resulting date for her death of 743 is too far too late for her to have been a sister of Æthelthryth, who was born in 636.|$|E
5|$|Development {{plans for}} Kingdom Hearts II began around the {{completion}} of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix, but specific details were undecided until July 2003. Nomura noted several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel. One such obstacle was the development team's desire to showcase Mickey Mouse more, which required Disney's approval. The game was developed by Square Enix's Product Development Division-1, {{with most of the}} original staff from the first game. The game was originally <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> released after Kingdom Hearts. Nomura had planned for the sequel to take place a year after the first and originally intended for the events of that year to be left unexplained. To bridge the gap between the two games, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories was developed. To explain the loss of all the abilities from the first game at the beginning of Kingdom Hearts II, Nomura had Sora's memories scrambled in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories.|$|E
50|$|In Horace Balatro {{is used as}} {{a proper}} name — Servilius Balatro. An old scholiast, in commenting on this word, derives the common word from the proper names; buffoons being called balatrones, because Servilius Balatro was a buffoon: but this is opposed to the natural {{inference}} from the former passage, and was said {{to get rid of a}} difficulty. Festus derives the word from blatea, and <b>supposes</b> buffoons <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> called balatrones, because they were dirty fellows, and were covered with spots of mud (blateae) with which they got spattered in walking; but this is opposed to sound etymology and common sense. Another writer has derived it from barathrum, and <b>supposes</b> buffoons <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> called balatrones, because they, so to speak, carried their jesting to market, even into the very depth (barathrum) of the shambles (barathrum macelli) Perhaps balatro may be connected with balare (to bleat like a sheep, and hence) to speak sillily. It is probably connected with blatero, a busy-body.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1913, there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{scholars}} who questioned whether al-Eizariya was the actual {{site of the}} ancient village of Bethany:Some believe that the present village of Bethany does not occupy {{the site of the}} ancient village; but that it grew up around the traditional cave which they <b>suppose</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> at some distance from the house of Martha and Mary in the village; Zanecchia (La Palestine d'aujourd'hui, 1899, I, 445f.) places the site of the ancient village of Bethany higher up on the southeastern slope of the Mount of Olives, not far from the accepted site of Bethphage, and near that of the Ascension. It is quite certain that the present village formed about the traditional tomb of Lazarus, which is in a cave in the village... The site of the ancient village may not precisely coincide with the present one, but {{there is every reason to}} believe that it was in this general location." ...|$|R

5|$|One of the {{principal}} French diversionary operations during 1806 was by a force that {{had been sent to}} sea in October 1805 as a diversion during the Trafalgar campaign, which by then was almost over. Sailing from Lorient to West Africa, L'Hermite was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> reinforced by a squadron under Jérôme Bonaparte and attack and capture British forts on the West African coast, thus forcing the detachment of British forces from the main campaign in pursuit. The events {{of the end of the}} Trafalgar campaign cancelled these plans, and the scheduled reinforcements were instead attached to Willaumez's squadron. Despite this setback, L'Hermite continued with elements of the original plan and attacked British merchant ships and slave ships off West Africa during the spring of 1806, inflicting some local damage but failing to capture a trading post or to affect the wider strategic situation. In June, L'Hermite sailed to Cayenne for supplies and then returned to Europe the following month, encountering part of the British blockade squadron under Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis on his return and losing the frigate Président.|$|E
5|$|Despite Bricius's earlier appeal, it was {{not until}} Andreas de Moravia's episcopate that Pope Honorius III issued his bull on 10 April 1224 authorising his legates Gilbert de Moravia, Bishop of Caithness, Robert, Abbot of Kinloss and Henry, Dean of Ross to examine the {{suitability}} of transferring the cathedra to Elgin. The Bishop of Caithness and the Dean of Ross performed the translation ceremony on 19 July 1224. On 10 July, Alexander II (Alaxandair mac Uilliam) had agreed to the transference in an edict that referred to his having given the land previously for this purpose. The land grant predated the Papal mandate and there is evidence that building had started in around 1215.Construction of the cathedral was completed after 1242. Chronicler John of Fordun recorded without explanation that in 1270 the cathedral church and the canons' houses had burned down. The cathedral was rebuilt in a larger and grander style to form the greater part of the structure that is now visible, work that is <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> completed by the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence in 1296. Although Edward I of England took an army to Elgin in 1296 and again in 1303, the cathedral was left unscathed, as it was by his grandson Edward III during his assault on Moray in 1336.|$|E
5|$|Six {{weeks after}} D-Day, the Allied {{invasion}} of Normandy on 6 June 1944, the German Army was in turmoil. While the Allied Army experienced great difficulty in {{breaking through the}} German lines (the city of Caen was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> captured {{on the first day}} of the invasion and was not taken until late in July) the German Army's defence of this area of Normandy was expending irreplaceable resources. The Allied air forces controlled the skies (up to 100km behind enemy lines), bombing and strafing Axis troops, reinforcements, and necessary army supplies, such as fuel and ammunition. On the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union's Operation Bagration and the Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive were in the midst of destroying the German Army Group Centre. In France, the German Army had used its available reserves (especially its armour reserves) to buttress the front lines around Caen, and there were few additional troops available to create successive lines of defence. To make matters worse, the 20 July plot—in which officers of the German Army, including some stationed in France, tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler and seize power—had failed, and in its aftermath there was very little trust between Hitler and his generals.|$|E
50|$|Shakespeare's {{primary source}} for Henry IV, Part 2, as {{for most of}} his chronicle histories, was Raphael Holinshed'sChronicles; the {{publication}} of the second edition in 1587 provides a terminus a quo for the play. Edward Hall's The Union of the Two Illustrious Families of Lancaster and York appears also <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> consulted, and scholars <b>have</b> also <b>supposed</b> Shakespeare <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> familiar with Samuel Daniel's poem on the civil wars.|$|R
