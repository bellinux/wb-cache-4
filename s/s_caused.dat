This study exam-ined {{the effects of}} steaming and roasting treat-ments on the enzyme activities, nutritional con-tents, and flour pasting properties of OR kernels. Results showed that a peeling time of 20 <b>s</b> <b>caused</b> 16. 13 % β-glucan loss, while a peeling time 25 <b>s</b> <b>caused</b> 34. 29 % β-glucan loss in the kernels. OR kernels with a 20 s peeling treatment demonstrated significantly higher starch levels and kernel whiteness compared with normal oat kernels (P< 0. 01). It was also found that normal pressure steaming, autoclaved steaming and infrared roasting treatments could exterminate lipase activities in the OR kernels, and provide the OR kernels with significantly lower final viscosities and setback values than normal kernels (P< 0. 01) ...|$|E

Baking absorption (500 Brabender Units line) decreased {{in the case of}} substitution of a limited proportion of flour (1 % and 2 %) with wheat flour WE-AGP, LW-AG and AT-GX. AT-GA decreased baking absorption less than wheat flour WE-AGP or LW-AG. Extended mixing times were required to obtain optimum Torfrida flour doughs (consistency of 500 Brabender Units) in the case of arabinogalactan(-peptide) substitution. However, this effect was not clear in the case of Soissons flour dough-making. Micro-extension tests on doughs (consistency of 500 Brabender Units and optimum mixing) illustrated that all arabinogalactan(-peptide) <b>s</b> <b>caused</b> a significant increase in maximum resistance to extension and a significant decrease in dough extensibility.

(3) S aureus is {{a major cause of}} hospital acquired (nosocomial) infection of surgical wounds and, with <b>S</b> epidermidis, <b>causes</b> infections associated with indwelling medical devices. (4) <b>S</b> aureus <b>causes</b> food poisoning by releasing enterotoxins into food. (5) <b>S</b> aureus <b>causes</b> toxic shock syndrome by release of superantigens into the blood stream. (6) <b>S</b> saprophiticus <b>causes</b> urinary tract infections, especially in girls. (7) Other species of staphylococci (S lugdunensis, S haemolyticus, S warneri, S schleiferi, S intermedius) are infrequent pathogens. Structure Staphylococci are Gram-positive cocci 1 µm in diameter. They form clumps. Classification S aureus and S intermedius are coagulase positive. All other staphylococci are coagulase negative. They are salt tolerant and often hemolytic. Identification requires biotype analysis. Natural Habitat S aureus colonizes the nasal passage and axillae. S epidermidis is a common human skin commensal. Other species of staphylococci are infrequent human commensals. Some are commensals of other animals. Pathogenesis S aureus expresses many potential virulence factors. (1) Surface proteins that promote colonization of host tissues. (2) Factors that probably inhibit phagocytosis (capsule, immunoglobulin binding protein A). (3) Toxins that damage host tissues and cause disease symptoms. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are normally less virulent and express fewer virulence factors. S epidermidis readily colonizes implanted devices. Host Defenses Phagocytosis is the major mechanism for combatting staphylococcal infection. Antibodies are produced which neutralize toxins and promote opsonization. The capsule and protein A may interfere with phagocytosis. Biofilm growth on implants is impervious to phagocytosis...|$|R
