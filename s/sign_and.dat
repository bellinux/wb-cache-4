30|$|Second, {{while driving}} speed is {{definitely}} the predominant measure for consideration around schools, the selection of appropriate traffic control devices should also consider other factors, such as visibility, legibility, and comprehension. All of these <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> markings are explicitly defined in China’s Road Traffic <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> Markings Manual (2009). Since {{a thorough understanding of}} traffic <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> markings is one of the prerequisites for obtaining a driver’s license, we assumed that all drivers are familiar with the <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> markings. Consequently, we did not evaluate drivers’ cognitive ability. Certainly, if possible, the legibility of <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> markings and drivers’ cognitive ability should be studied in further research.|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} work {{is focused}} on describing principles, procedures, effects, benefits and usage posibility of two comnunication methods: Baby <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Signing</b> with babies.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} and testing of a tool designed to assess chronic wounds for the clinical <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> symptoms of localized infection. Thirty-one wounds were assessed by two independent nurse observers for the <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> symptoms of infection using the Clinical <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> Symptoms Checklist. The Clinical <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> Symptoms Checklist delineates 12 <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> symptoms of infection (i. e., pain, erythema, edema, heat, purulent exudate, serous exudate with concurrent inflammation, delayed healing, discoloration of granulation tissue, friable granulation tissue, pocketing {{at the base of}} the wound, foul odor, and wound breakdown) and their definitions. The reliability of each sign or symptom on the checklist was calculated using percent agreement and the Kappa statistic. Percent agreement ranged from 65 % to 100 %, and Kappa statistics ranged from 0. 53 to 1. 00, excluding pocketing of the wound base. The reliability estimates obtained for <b>signs</b> <b>and</b> symptoms on the Clinical <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> Symptoms Checklist compare favorably with other data regarding interclinician agreement on wound assessment. Incorporating a structured approach to assess and monitor for wound infection, such as the Clinical <b>Signs</b> <b>and</b> Symptoms Checklist, may improve clinician skill and accuracy in identifying this condition...|$|R

5|$|Gowariker {{had always}} aspired {{to make a}} romantic comedy and was {{inspired}} to adapt Rye's novel into a feature film after watching a play {{based on the same}} source material. Later, he bought the rights and co-wrote the screenplay with playwright Naushil Mehta. In the process, several plot changes were made for the cinematic adaptation, notably the similarity between the twelve girls, and the ending. Since Gowariker was against using prosthetics to create the twelve characters, Chopra worked on her body language and her voice to make them distinct. Principal photography was extensively done at sixty-seven locations across Mumbai, and partly in Baroda and Chicago. The soundtrack, consisting of thirteen songs, each representing an astrological <b>sign</b> <b>and</b> one compilation, was composed by Sohail Sen, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar.|$|E

It also featured on-screen sexual intercourse, framed in a medium shot, which Lee intended as a <b>sign</b> <b>and</b> not simply a sex scene. Although Priceless, meant as a sequel to Subrosa, went through more than thirty drafts, it was ultimately cancelled despite interest from Alliance Atlantis and Citytv.|$|E
