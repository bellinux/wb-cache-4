[...] Research into passenger comfort resulting from vibrations, acceleration, lighting, heating and cooling, <b>seat</b> <b>spacing,</b> cushion height, space for arms, legs, standing passengers, economies of weight affecting maintenance, cost of power, reduced wear of components and track. [...] Dimensions were established to fit the majority but could easily be changed for special situations. [...] Windows were spaced to match seating.|$|E

This paper will discuss relative performance of compartmentalization, lap belt restraints and lap/shoulder belt restraints, {{as well as}} the effects of seat back height and <b>seat</b> <b>spacing</b> on the performance of these safety restraint strategies. Results of NHTSA’s frontal sled testing efforts with an inflatable airbag belt system are reviewed. The agency’s efforts on researching side impact protection are also briefly discussed.

40|$|Previous {{work in the}} {{development}} of quantitative models for the prediction of passenger reaction to motion and vehicle environment parameters in flight was extended to include a class of aircraft appropriate for low-density, short-haul service. The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} obtain quantitative response inputs from an usually small special test-subject group which will be representative of the general traveling public. Additional data which indicate the importance of comfort as a factor in evaluating ride quality was obtained, and identification of the factors which contribute to judgments regarding comfort level was improved. Seat comfort and <b>seat</b> <b>spacing</b> is very vital in the smaller aircraft. Mathematical modeling applied in conjuction with passenger reaction data was shown to be very useful for establishing ride-quality design criteria...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering"December 2007. "Buses {{and coaches}} form {{a vital part}} of the {{national}} as well as city public transportation network. Buses are still one of the safest modes of transportation. Nevertheless, bus accidents resulting in passenger injuries and fatalities do occur. According to the Traffic Safety Facts statistical reports from 1999 to 2003, an average of 40 fatalities and 18, 430 injuries of bus occupants occurred per year. These accidents involved normal vehicle impacts, such as head-on or rear-end collisions. In this thesis the crashworthiness of the passenger compartment in a mass transit bus is evaluated and interior design guidelines that will mitigate the fatalities and injuries of the occupants during a crash event are recommended. Computational modeling and crash sled testing are used to analyze the frontal, side and rear accident scenarios in the passenger compartment. This report includes the evaluation of occupant injury during three accident scenarios by validating numerical models through MADYMO and LSDYNA codes versus experimental sled tests using Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSSs) 208 injury criteria. Interior components are evaluated against crashworthiness requirements from the FMVSS and the Standard Bus Procurement Guidelines (SBPG). The sled pulses were generated from validated bus model finite element (FE) simulations of critical real-crash scenarios for frontal, rear and side conditions. The validated numerical model was then subjected to parametric studies to analyze the influence of the current vehicle interior design parameters, e. g., <b>Seat</b> <b>spacing,</b> seat height, location etc. on passenger kinematics and biomechanical performance. This study was carried out through a Design of Experiments (DOE). Optimization studies were carried out to define new bus interior designs that would reduce or mitigate passenger injuries...|$|E
