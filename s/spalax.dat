25|$|In blind mole rats (genus <b>Spalax),</b> {{the process}} of {{necrosis}} replaces {{the role of the}} systematic apoptosis normally used in many organisms. Low oxygen conditions, such as those common in blind mole rats' burrows, usually cause cells to undergo apoptosis. In adaptation to higher tendency of cell death, blind mole rats evolved a mutation in the tumor suppressor protein p53 (which is also used in humans) to prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis. Human cancer patients have similar mutations, and blind mole rats were thought to be more susceptible to cancer because their cells cannot undergo apoptosis. However, after a specific amount of time (within 3 days according to a study conducted at the University of Rochester), the cells in blind mole rats release interferon-beta (which the immune system normally uses to counter viruses) in response to over-proliferation of cells caused by the suppression of apoptosis. In this case, the interferon-beta triggers cells to undergo necrosis, and this mechanism also kills cancer cells in blind mole rats. Because of tumor suppression mechanisms such as this, blind mole rats and other spalacids are resistant to cancer.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Spalax</b> mole rats {{are truly}} blind. [...] Their very small eyes are {{completely}} {{covered by a}} layer of skin. Unlike many other fossorial rodents, <b>Spalax</b> mole rats do not have enlarged front claws and {{do not appear to}} use their forearms as a primary digging tool. Digging is almost exclusively conducted using their powerful front teeth, which are separated {{from the rest of the}} mouth by a flap of skin. When a <b>Spalax</b> mole rat closes its mouth, its incisors are still on the outside. Blind mole rats may have evolved from spalacids that used their front limbs to dig, because their olecranon processes are relatively large relative to the rest of their arms. The olecranon process is a part of the ulna bone where muscles attach, and digging animals tend to have enlarged olecranon processes to provide a large surface for their large and powerful muscles to attach.|$|E

Because of tumor suppression mechanisms such as this, blind mole rats and other spalacids are resistant to cancer.The involvement of interferon in the so called concertated cells death of <b>Spalax</b> cells via necrosis (see ref. 4) was highly criticized.
