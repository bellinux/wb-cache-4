5|$|Holland Arms' {{functionality}} {{as a staff}} {{station was}} only useful for the Red Wharf Bay branch, but a signalman was still required for all Amlwch services. In about 1925, LMS introduced a switching-out <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> turn the Gaerwen-Holland Arms and Holland Arms-Llangefni sections into one long section. This was of particular advantage in early mornings and evenings, when the only services were on the Amlwch line.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{showcase}} the PlayStation Portable's capabilities, {{the team had}} to develop a download <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> provide the game with future downloadable content, which included new tracks, music and ships. In addition, Burrows realised that new downloadable content {{had the potential to}} bring in more revenue for Studio Liverpool. In order to achieve this, the team {{had to find a way}} to bypass the problems involved in getting the PlayStation Portable to recognise download files. The solution required the use of piggybacking game data to a valid format recognised by the PlayStation Portable; in which a dummy file would be used on a web-based Java application.|$|E
5|$|Miss Honora Sneyd {{would not}} admit the {{unqualified}} {{control of a}} husband over all her actions; she did not feel, that seclusion from society was indispensably necessary to preserve female virtue, or to secure domestic happiness. Upon terms of reasonable equality, she supposed, that mutual confidence might best subsist; she said, that, as Mr Day had decidedly declared his determination to live in perfect seclusion from what is usually called the world, it was fit she should decidedly declare, {{that she would not}} change her present mode of life, with which she had no reason to be dissatisfied, for any dark and untried <b>system,</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be proposed to her.|$|E
5000|$|Google (Google Modular Data Center) have {{developed}} <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> {{be used for}} this purpose.|$|R
50|$|Ideas for {{computational}} microscale models {{arose in}} {{the earliest days of}} computing and were applied to complex <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not accurately be described by standard mathematical forms.|$|R
50|$|March - Toyota Motor Corp {{issued a}} recall about 22,000 sport utility {{vehicles}} and pickup trucks over tire-deflation monitoring <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> cause failure. No such crashes or injuries were reported.|$|R
5|$|Triton had {{a number}} of {{attributes}} that made her a potential NECPA platform. Her size allowed ample room for additional shipboard systems and personnel accommodations. Her designed speed provided the capability for rapid transit, and her nuclear power plant offered virtually unlimited endurance and range. The Combat Information Center (CIC) provided substantial command and control capabilities as did the communication buoy <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> receive and send radio transmissions while submerged. As she was a submarine, Triton offered superior protection against nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) contaminants over surface ships or an airborne command centre. However, the record remains unclear if such an explicit NECPA conversion was ever undertaken for Triton.|$|E
5|$|Wallace's 1904 book Man's Place in the Universe was {{the first}} serious attempt by a {{biologist}} to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets. He concluded that the Earth was the only planet in the solar <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> possibly support life, mainly {{because it was the}} only one in which water could exist in the liquid phase. More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets with the necessary properties (the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time).|$|E
5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to be rotated at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|E
500|$|... "The Civilizing Process" [...] – Consolidation of {{centralized}} {{states and}} kingdoms throughout Europe {{results in the}} rise of criminal justice and commercial infrastructure, organizing previously chaotic <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> lead to raiding and mass violence.|$|R
50|$|The 2741's {{existence}} {{encouraged the}} development of other remote terminal systems for the IBM System/360, particularly <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> benefit from the high print quality, interchangeable typing elements, and other advantages of its Selectric mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Originally, desk {{accessories}} {{were developed}} to provide a small degree of multitasking in operating <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> only held one main application at a time, but when real multitasking OSes became available, these were replaced by normal applications.|$|R
25|$|In 2014, Google {{engineers}} {{demonstrated a}} <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> defeat CAPTCHA challenges with 99.8% accuracy.|$|E
25|$|AFSS is {{a project}} to develop an {{autonomous}} on-board <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> augment or replace traditional ground-commanded Range Safety flight termination systems. The AFSS would use redundant sensors and processors on board a launch vehicle to monitor its trajectory, and if necessary initiate pyrotechnic devices to terminate the flight.|$|E
25|$|Land Rover {{presented}} at the 2008 London Motor Show its new ERAD diesel-electric hybrid {{in a pair of}} Freelander 2 (LR2) prototypes. The new hybrid system is being designed as a scalable and modular <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be applied across a variety of Land Rover models and powertrains.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Land Information New Zealand {{published}} the first list of official place names with macrons, which indicate long vowels. Previous place name lists {{were derived from}} systems (usually mapping and geographic information <b>systems)</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not handle macrons.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was assumed}} <b>that</b> current {{technology}} <b>could</b> not produce gravitational waves for means of communication, however recent experiments have proven successful in detecting these waves {{and as a}} result give scientists an opportunity to start developing the technology for <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> radicalize space exploration.|$|R
40|$|Porosity in {{composite}} media using ultrasonic waves is characterized. The derivation {{of local}} approximations to the Kramers-Kronig relations are presented {{and it is}} shown that {{they may also be}} applicable to <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> conceivably exhibit considerable dispersion such as composite laminates containing porosity...|$|R
25|$|The U.S. poured massive funding into {{development}} of SAGE, a <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> track and intercept enemy bomber aircraft using information from remote radar stations. It {{was the first}} computer system to feature real-time processing, multiplexing, and display devices. It was the first general computing machine, and a direct predecessor of modern computers.|$|E
25|$|Amidst {{all of this}} {{there was}} {{the need for a}} {{high-speed}} transportation <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> link the Whitewater Valley to the Ohio River. Before the canal, farmers had to transport their goods and livestock to Cincinnati, Ohio on badly rutted and often impassable roads. The journey to Cincinnati could take several days.|$|E
25|$|The GL {{team had}} already started plans for a greatly {{improved}} version of the <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> also provide accurate bearing and elevation information. They had always wanted the GL system {{to be able to}} direct the guns in all measurements, but the pressing need to get the system into the field as soon as possible precluded this.|$|E
5000|$|STS-1 was {{the first}} test flight of what was, at the time, the most complex {{spacecraft}} ever built. Numerous anomalies were observed {{during and after the}} flight, owing to the many components and <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not otherwise be adequately tested. Notable anomalies included: ...|$|R
25|$|The famine {{resulted}} from combined effects of economic disturbance—which {{had already started}} during World War I, and continued through the disturbances of the Russian Revolution—and Russian Civil War with its policy of War Communism, especially prodrazvyorstka, exacerbated by rail <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not distribute food efficiently.|$|R
40|$|Boundary {{representations}} (defined following (1. 1) below) are the noncommuta-tive counterparts {{of points}} in the Choquet boundary of a function system in C(X).

25|$|A 2013 {{report from}} the U.S. National Research Council called for {{attention}} to the abrupt impacts of climate change, stating that even steady, gradual change in the physical climate system can have abrupt impacts elsewhere—in human infrastructure and ecosystems for example—if critical thresholds are crossed. The report emphasizes {{the need for an}} early warning <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> help society better anticipate sudden changes and emerging impacts.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Senator Barbara Boxer (CA-D) and Congressman Steve Israel (NY-D) {{introduced}} legislation {{in both the}} House and Senate (H.R. 580/S. 311 The Commercial Airline Missile Defense Act) that directed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to sponsor a research and development program {{that would result in}} a missile defense <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be installed on commercial airliners; the bill also authorized funding for the program.|$|E
25|$|Europa {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of the locations in the Solar <b>System</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> possibly harbor microbial extraterrestrial life. Immediately following the Galileo spacecraft's discoveries, JPL conducted preliminary mission studies that envisioned a capable spacecraft such as the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (a $16B mission concept), the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (a $4.3B concept), an orbiter ($2B concept), and a multi-flyby spacecraft: Europa Clipper.|$|E
50|$|The XT/370 {{came with}} an XT-style 83-key {{keyboard}} (10 function keys). Newer {{revisions of the}} XT/370 dropped the PC3277-EM {{in favor of the}} IBM 3278/79 boards. The XT/370 was among the XT <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> use a second hard drive mounted in the 5161 expansion chassis.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, {{organizations}} outside of libraries began developing more sophisticated information retrieval systems. Web search engines like Google and popular e-commerce {{websites such as}} Amazon.com provided simpler to use (yet more powerful) <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> provide relevancy ranked search results using probabilistic and vector-based queries.|$|R
50|$|The famine {{resulted}} from combined effects of economic disturbance—which {{had already started}} during World War I, and continued through the disturbances of the Russian Revolution—and Russian Civil War with its policy of War Communism, especially prodrazvyorstka, exacerbated by rail <b>systems</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not distribute food efficiently.|$|R
25|$|The MSSR was {{developed}} {{due to the}} need of a sniper rifle <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> effectively use 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition (most other sniper rifles use the larger 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge). This was done mainly for cost-saving and availability reasons since the Armed Forces of the Philippines are actively engaged in counter-insurgency and internal security operations, especially against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Abu Sayyaf Group.|$|E
25|$|The Metro was {{originally}} {{built as a}} <b>system</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> offer shelter {{in case of a}} nuclear attack. Every station is equipped with CCTV surveillance following recent terrorist threats. Until the summer of 2009, all photography and video filming in the Metro required a written permit. However, because of a legal challenge by an amateur photographer, after 24 August 2009, photography without a flash can be done without a permit.|$|E
25|$|On 26 January 1926, Baird {{repeated}} the transmission {{for members of}} the Royal Institution and a reporter from The Times in his laboratory at 22 Frith Street in the Soho district of London, where Bar Italia is now located. By this time, he had improved the scan rate to 12.5 pictures per second.
