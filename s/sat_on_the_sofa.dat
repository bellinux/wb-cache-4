2500|$|I've {{been getting}} fan mail from maximum {{security}} penitentiaries and death row. What are the authorities thinking of in playing a show with young teenage girls to Death Row inmates? They write everything – disgusting {{things that you}} don't even want to know about. And they send me pictures – [...] "Oh, here's {{a picture of me}} before I was incarcerated!" [...] – and there's some guy <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> with a bottle of beer and a moustache, and a big gut. It's so creepy. Way more creepy than Buffy.|$|E
60|$|His {{words were}} evidently a {{surprise}} to her. She threw away her cigarette and came and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> by his side.|$|E
60|$|She <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> calmly sewing, as the mate, whose hardihood {{was rapidly}} failing him, entered Her manner gave him no {{assistance}} whatever, and coming sheepishly in {{he took a}} chair.|$|E
60|$|Anne <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> her dauntless spirit subdued at last.|$|R
60|$|All {{the time}} Lily <b>sat</b> miserably <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b> He {{turned to her}} swiftly.|$|R
60|$|When I {{returned}} to the drawing-room, Aunt Emma <b>sat</b> there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> crying silently, <b>the</b> very picture of misery.|$|R
6000|$|... "Eve," [...] I whispered, as we <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> together, while Mrs Liston was {{wiping her}} spectacles, [...] "I've been earnestly {{considering}} that last attempt of yours, and I think upon the whole, that `Geo'ge' is better." ...|$|E
60|$|Peter {{stood before}} the fire and {{surveyed}} Eve as she <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b> They {{were alone in the}} room, Mr. Rastall-Retford having drifted silently away {{in the wake of his}} mother. Suddenly Eve began to laugh helplessly.|$|E
6000|$|The Countess {{sprang from}} her chair and came and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> beside her visitor. [...] "Ah, you must send me the paper! My husband won't like it, but he need never see it. Besides, he doesn't know how to read." ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> as he {{said the}} words, cherishing the plump peachey cheek that lay {{uppermost}} on his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Fanny did not answer, but she <b>sat</b> upright <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> {{as he came}} up to her--and he {{then sat}} down beside her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Without {{waiting for}} Bluebeard's {{asking for the}} key! Oh, Maria!' cried Albinia, {{in a fit of}} laughter, while Sophia <b>sat</b> up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> in {{speechless}} indignation.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Davenant got up {{and came}} and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> beside her: {{she put her arms}} round her and the two women embraced. 'Your room is all ready,' the old lady remarked. And then she said, 'When did she leave you? When did you see her last?' ...|$|E
60|$|One morning, a {{considerable}} {{time after the}} events narrated in the last chapter, I <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> waiting for breakfast, and engaged in an interesting conversation with Dumps. The only difference in our mode of communication was that Dumps talked with his eyes, I with my tongue.|$|E
6000|$|They {{went downstairs}} and 'ad tea together, and young Alf soon see {{the truth of}} his uncle's remarks. Mrs. Pearce--that was the 'ousekeeper's name--called his uncle [...] "dear" [...] every time she spoke to 'im, and arter tea she <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> {{side by side with}} 'im and held his 'and.|$|E
60|$|Lilly felt in his pocket, {{and gave}} the {{policeman}} half a crown. But he was watching Aaron, who <b>sat</b> stupidly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> very pale and semi-conscious.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{send her}} here too, an' look alive, lass." [...] So saying, Captain Dunning <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> {{and began to}} beat the floor with his right foot {{somewhat}} impatiently.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Jeff, this is dreadful!" [...] said my poor mother, as she untied her bonnet-strings, and <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> beside Bella, {{who could}} not for some time utter a word.|$|R
60|$|And in the evening, after supper, {{he stood}} on the {{hearthrug}} whilst she <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> and he seemed to hate her. In the afternoon he had left her whilst he went to see some old friend. She had sat looking at a book. After supper William wanted to write a letter.|$|E
60|$|The girl {{came and}} {{clustered}} close against {{her as she}} <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> and so contrived as to creep in under her arm. No one had ever crept in under her arm, or clung close to her before. Such outward signs of affection as {{that had never been}} hers, either to give or to receive.|$|E
6000|$|I had {{scarcely}} {{said how}} good it was in Dermot, when he sauntered in. [...] "There you are, Vi; I'm come to your rescue, you know," [...] he said, in his lazy way, and disposed himself on the bear-skin as we <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b> I tried again to utter a protest. [...] "Oh Dermot, it was all your doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's too bad," [...] said Jordan. [...] "Old cat," [...] {{he muttered}} after the {{retreating}} and serenely unconscious Mrs. William. Then he shambled in and <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> beside Aunty Nan.|$|R
60|$|Tom's {{eyes flashed}} out one look of {{surprise}} at her, {{before he turned}} pale, and trembled visibly. He said nothing, but <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> again, looking vaguely out of the opposite window.|$|R
60|$|Ellen {{went away}} to her state-room and <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> {{opposite}} Lottie, and she lost herself in a muse {{in which she was}} found by the voice of the sufferer in the berth.|$|R
60|$|Paul {{was in bed}} {{for seven}} weeks. He got up white and fragile. His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips. They used to flame in {{the window in the}} March {{sunshine}} as he <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> chattering to his mother. The two knitted together in perfect intimacy. Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.|$|E
60|$|But it did {{not look}} as if the {{engagement}} was broken off. Not at any rate on this raw November evening, {{when there was a}} dense fog outside, but a bright, cheery fire and plenty of light in the little sitting room at the Langham, and Luke <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> beside Louisa, and plain Louisa--in last autumn's gown--looking at him with her candid, luminous eyes.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he told me}} {{that there}} had been no time, and how useless my {{presence}} would have been. We <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> and he gasped out something of the sad story, though not by any means all that I afterwards learnt from himself and from the Yollands, but enough to make me feel the reality of the terrible loss. And I will tell the whole here.|$|E
6000|$|I {{went with}} him at once. Arrived there, he put his head out, glanced {{up and down the}} saloon warily, then closed the door and locked it. He <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> and he said-- ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>sat</b> by her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> and {{finished}} <b>the</b> {{story of the}} Sicilian lovers.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Vansuythen <b>sat</b> down helplessly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> overborne by <b>the</b> {{trouble of}} her questioner.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Woodward twined her arm {{round her}} daughter's waist, as they <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> {{close to each}} other. Linda tried to compose herself, but {{she felt that she}} was {{trembling}} in her mother's arms. She would have given anything to be calm; anything to hide her secret. She little guessed then how well her mother knew it. Her eyes were turned down, and she found that she could not raise them to her mother's face.|$|E
60|$|They came to {{the silent}} house. He took the key out of the scullery window, and they entered. All the time he went on with his discussion. He lit the gas, mended the fire, and brought her some cakes from the pantry. She <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> quietly, with a plate on her knee. She wore a large white hat with some pinkish flowers. It was a cheap hat, but he liked it. Her face beneath was still and pensive, golden-brown and ruddy. Always her ears were hid in her short curls. She watched him.|$|E
60|$|Marco {{cast his}} eyes {{occasionally}} toward the office, {{expecting to see}} Forester come out. He thought Forester {{would want to know}} whether he went a-fishing or not. But he did not come. Marco spent some time in the garden with James, who was at work there raking over the ground, and gathering in such things as might be hurt by any sudden frost. Marco worked with him for some time, and endeavored to converse with him, but he did not find him very communicative, and at last he went into the house and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> in the parlor, reading, until supper time.|$|E
6000|$|Marian <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> {{and looked}} at him for some time gravely and a little wistfully. [...] "I think," [...] she said, [...] "I should feel very angry if any woman made such a {{confession}} to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|At Marget's it {{was like}} a funeral. She and Wilhelm <b>sat</b> {{together}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> but said nothing, and not even holding hands. Both were steeped in gloom, and Marget's eyes were red from the crying she had been doing. She said: ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Pendyce <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b> She {{had been}} {{brushing}} her hair; though silvered, {{it was still}} thick and soft, {{and the sight of}} it about her shoulders struck George. He had never thought of her having hair that would hang down.|$|R
