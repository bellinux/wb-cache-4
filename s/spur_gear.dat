25|$|Mounted in this carrier are {{one or more}} {{pairs of}} {{identical}} pinions, generally longer than their diameters, and typically smaller than the spur gears on the individual half-shafts. Each pinion pair rotates freely on pins supported by the carrier. Furthermore, the pinion pairs are displaced axially, such that they mesh only for the part of their length between the two spur gears, and rotate in opposite directions. The remaining length of a given pinion meshes with the nearer <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> on its axle. Therefore, each pinion couples that <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> to the other pinion, and in turn, the other <b>spur</b> <b>gear,</b> {{so that when the}} drive shaft rotates the carrier, its relationship to the gears for the individual wheel axles is the same as that in a bevel-gear differential.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{the angular}} {{velocity}} of the carrier of a <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> differential is {{the average of the}} angular velocities of the sun and annular gears.|$|E
25|$|Gears {{inside a}} {{windmill}} convey {{power from the}} rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between {{the front and rear}} bearing. It has the brake around the outside of the rim and teeth {{in the side of the}} rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In grist mills, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> arrangement. Additional gear wheels drive a sack hoist or other machinery.|$|E

25|$|Hobbing uses a {{hobbing machine}} with two skew spindles, one mounted {{with a blank}} {{workpiece}} {{and the other with}} the hob. The angle between the hob's spindle (axis) and the workpiece's spindle varies, {{depending on the type of}} product being produced. For example, if a <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> is being produced, then the hob is angled equal to the helix angle of the hob; if a helical gear is being produced then the angle must be increased by the same amount as the helix angle of the helical gear. The two shafts are rotated at a proportional ratio, which determines the number of teeth on the blank; for example, for a single-threaded hob if the gear ratio is 40:1 the hob rotates 40 times to each turn of the blank, which produces 40 teeth in the blank. If the hob has multiple threads the speed ratio must be multiplied by the number of threads on the hob. The hob is then fed up into the workpiece until the correct tooth depth is obtained. Finally the hob is fed through the workpiece parallel to the blank's axis of rotation.|$|E

Two gears are studied from kinematic theoretically point of view: a gear with identically oval <b>spur</b> <b>gears</b> and another gear with identically elliptical <b>spur</b> <b>gears,</b> and simulation diagrams are presented. As for the educational model, a gear with identically oval <b>spur</b> <b>gears</b> has been used. The researchers are able to draw with high precision the variation curve of output angle with respect to input angle. By using numerical methods for integration and differentiation other diagrams could be drawn and a comparison with simulation diagrams could be made...|$|R
2500|$|Henry Ford {{experimented with}} both auto-plows and heavier tractors. In August 1915, at a plowing {{demonstration}} in Fremont, Nebraska, he introduced a newly designed tractor {{known as the}} Model B. It used a 16horsepower, two-cylinder, horizontally opposed engine, a <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> transmission and three wheels - two front drivers and one rear steerer. The Model B was never produced, but did gain enough publicity to let the world know Ford was interested in developing a tractor.|$|E
2500|$|The Marchant, however, has, {{for every}} one of its ten columns of keys, a nine-ratio [...] "preselector transmission" [...] with its output <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> {{at the top of the}} machine's body; that gear engages the {{accumulator}} gearing. When one tries to work out the numbers of teeth in such a transmission, a straightforward approach leads one to consider a mechanism like that in mechanical gasoline pump registers, used to indicate the total price. However, this mechanism is seriously bulky, and utterly impractical for a calculator; 90-tooth gears are likely to be found in the gas pump. Practical gears in the computing parts of a calculator cannot have 90 teeth. They would be either too big, or too delicate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ignition}} system {{was similar to}} that of the Model T,with a flywheel-mounted low-tension magneto and trembler coils. The ignition timing was manually advanced or retarded with the spark advance lever mounted near the steering column, which rotated the timer. The cooling was by thermosiphon. (In later decades, a high-tension magneto and a water pump would be added.) The transmission was a three-speed <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> (the three forward speeds ranged from approximately 2 to 6mph). A worm drive reduction set and a differential made up the rear. The design of the rear was patented for its ease of manufacture and service. Brakes were not provided on early Fordsons, as high-ratio worm sets generally transmitted rotation in one direction only, from the worm element to the gear element, because of the high power loss through friction. To stop the tractor, the driver depressed the clutch.|$|E

As a result of these analyses conducted, it has been determined that the wear behaviors of these newly manufactured curvilinear involute-profile gears are better than the behaviors of the <b>spur</b> <b>gears,</b> and in the increasing number of cycles, the curvilinear involute-profile gears had less wear than the <b>spur</b> <b>gears</b> have...|$|R

The FEA results from the various model settings are used to develop a common formula for the combined torsional stiffness of <b>spur</b> <b>gears</b> in mesh. The torsional mesh stiffness of gears in mesh consists of three main components which are the body, teeth and contact stiffnesses.
