5|$|The {{limestone}} {{sculpture of}} Seneb {{and his family}} {{is part of the}} collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. It depicts Seneb and his wife sitting next to each other with their children in the lower register. Seneb is depicted <b>sitting</b> <b>cross-legged</b> on a block of stone with his arms folded in a position characteristic of a scribe. His wife Senet sits alongside him, wearing a long robe with long sleeves and a wig covering her natural hair, which can be glimpsed on her forehead. She encircles him with her arms in a gesture of affection and support. She is shown with a slight smile on her face to signify her contentment and happiness.|$|E
5|$|Seneb is {{depicted}} {{with his wife}} and children in a painted sculpture from his tomb, rediscovered in 1926, that is a famous example of Old Kingdom art. It shows him <b>sitting</b> <b>cross-legged</b> on a block of stone with his wife embracing him and his children standing below him where the legs of a full-size person would ordinarily have been. The composition of the scene thus achieves a harmonious symmetry. It depicts Seneb realistically with the facial features and shortened limbs of an individual with achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism. Paintings and carvings in the tomb give his titles and depict various scenes from his life, such as carrying out inspections of his estate and holding symbols of his office.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} erect sitting, slouched posture with <b>cross-legged</b> <b>sitting,</b> and erect posture with <b>cross-legged</b> <b>sitting</b> on the lumbar and pelvic angles, and gluteal pressure. [Subjects] For the ex-periments, 17 healthy women were recruited. [Methods] All {{subjects were asked to}} perform three sitting postures: erect sitting, slouched posture with <b>cross-legged</b> <b>sitting,</b> and erect posture with <b>cross-legged</b> <b>sitting.</b> Lumbar and pelvic angles were measured using a three-dimensional motion-capture system, and gluteal pressure was measured using a pressure mat. [Results] Compared to erector sitting, slouched posture with <b>cross-legged</b> <b>sitting</b> showed significantly greater lumbar flexion, posterior pelvic tilt, and left pelvic tilt. Compared to erect sitting, erect posture with <b>cross-legged</b> <b>sitting</b> showed significantly greater lumbar flexion and posterior pelvic tilt. Compared to erect posture with <b>cross-legged</b> <b>sitting,</b> slouched posture with <b>cross-legged</b> <b>sitting</b> showed significantly greater lumbar flexion and posterior pelvic tilt. Compared to erect sitting and erect posture with <b>cross-legged</b> <b>sitting,</b> slouched pos-ture with <b>cross-legged</b> <b>sitting</b> showed significantly greater left gluteal pressure; {{there was no significant difference}} in right gluteal pressure. [Conclusion] An erect posture can reduce changes in lumbar and pelvic angles, and gluteal pressure compared to a slouched posture during <b>cross-legged</b> <b>sitting...</b>|$|R

This study assessed the contribution of physical factors including lumbar posture to scoliosis in non-ambulatory youth with DMD in Nepal. Methods: Linear regression {{was used to assess}} effects of time since loss of ambulation, muscle strength, functional severity and lumbar angle as a binary variable on coronal Cobb angle; again logistic regression was used to assess effects of muscle strength and <b>cross-legged</b> <b>sitting</b> on the presence of a lordotic lumbar posture in 22 non-ambulant boys and young men. Results: The boys and young men had a mean (SD) age of 15. 1 (4. 0) years, had been non-ambulant for 48. 6 (33. 8) months and used a median of 3. 5 (range 2 to 7) postures a day. The mean Cobb angle was 15. 1 (range 0 to 70) degrees. Optimal accuracy in predicting scoliosis was obtained with a lumbar angle of - 6 ° as measured by skin markers, and both a lumbar angle ≤- 6 ° (P= 0. 112) and better functional ability (P= 0. 102) were associated with less scoliosis. Use of <b>cross-legged</b> <b>sitting</b> postures during the day was associated with a lumbar angle ≤- 6 ° (OR 0. 061; 95 % CI 0. 005 - 0. 672; P= 0. 022).

25|$|After {{consolidating}} {{his political}} position through military campaigns, diplomacy, and a firm domestic administration, Suryavarman launched into {{the construction of}} Angkor Wat as his personal temple mausoleum. Breaking with {{the tradition of the}} Khmer kings, and influenced perhaps by the concurrent rise of Vaisnavism in India, he dedicated the temple to Vishnu rather than to Siva. With walls nearly half a mile long on each side, Angkor Wat grandly portrays the Hindu cosmology, with the central towers representing Mount Meru, home of the gods; the outer walls, the mountains enclosing the world; and the moat, the oceans beyond. The traditional theme of identifying the Khmer devaraja with the gods, and his residence with that of the celestials, is very much in evidence. The measurements themselves of the temple and its parts in relation to one another have cosmological significance. Suryavarman had the walls of the temple decorated with bas reliefs depicting not only scenes from mythology, but also from the life of his own imperial court. In one of the scenes, the king himself is portrayed as larger in size than his subjects, <b>sitting</b> <b>cross-legged</b> on an elevated throne and holding court, while a bevy of attendants make him comfortable with the aid of parasols and fans.|$|E

60|$|May 24.--We were awakened at {{daylight}} by the discordant orisons of the Lama; these commenced by {{the boys}} beating the great tambourine, then blowing the conch-shells, {{and finally the}} trumpets and thigh-bone. Shortly the Lama entered, clad in scarlet, shorn and barefooted, wearing a small red silk mitre, a loose gown girt round the middle, and an under-garment of questionable colour, possibly once purple. He walked along, slowly muttering his prayers, {{to the end of}} the apartment, whence he took a brass bell and dorge, and, <b>sitting</b> down <b>cross-legged,</b> commenced matins, counting his beads, or ringing the bell, and uttering most dismal prayers. After various disposals of the cups, a larger bell was violently rung for some minutes, himself snapping his fingers and uttering most unearthly sounds. Finally, incense was brought, of charcoal with juniper-sprigs; it was swung about, and concluded the morning service to our great relief, for the noises were quite intolerable. Fervid as the devotions appeared, to judge by their intonation, I fear the Lama felt more curious about us than was proper under the circumstances; and when I tried to sketch him, his excitement knew no bounds; he fairly turned round on the settee, and, continuing his prayers and bell-accompaniment, appeared to be exorcising me, or some spirit within me.|$|R

Later that day he phoned Ono, whose own husband Tony (Anthony Cox) was in Paris on business, and invited her to Kenwood. Shotton left the two alone, whereupon Lennon invited Ono (who had also taken LSD) up to the attic to hear his largely experimental non-Beatles' recordings. For the rest of the night, the two collaborated on what became the [...] album, and then [...] "made love at dawn", according to Lennon. Cynthia returned early from her vacation, and discovered Lennon and Ono <b>sitting</b> <b>cross-legged</b> on the floor and staring intently into each other's eyes (Ono was wearing one of Cynthia's bathrobes). In a state of shock, Cynthia then left to stay with friends for a few days, although Lennon and Cynthia were reconciled for a time upon her return to Kenwood. It was during Cynthia's next holiday in Italy that Lennon and Ono finally entered into a permanent relationship, and Lennon asked for a divorce. Cynthia, together with Julian and her mother, moved back into Kenwood for the summer, where Paul McCartney visited her to offer his support. On the journey to Kenwood he composed the song [...] "Hey Jude", which eventually became The Beatles' biggest selling single. Lennon and Ono, meanwhile, were without a permanent address for a time. They stayed with McCartney at his house in Cavendish Avenue (where it is alleged that a further breach occurred in the Lennon–McCartney relationship when Lennon discovered a derogatory note written by McCartney) and with Peter Brown and then Neil Aspinall, before moving into an apartment leased by Starr at 34 Montagu Square, Marylebone in London. They were evicted from this flat by the owner following a raid by the drug squad on 18 October 1968, and subsequent November trial, and so moved back into Kenwood for a short time, which had been vacated by Cynthia. In the new year Ono and Lennon moved into the Dorchester Hotel in London, leaving Kenwood for the last time.|$|E

40|$|Years ago I {{was invited}} to spend some weeks in Japan. On {{the advice of a}} friend I read about the history and the culture of the people. Nevertheless I found myself totally {{unprepared}} for what I found. Like the Japanese, I was born on a small island in a temperate zone between a continent and a vast expanse of ocean. Through the centuries their ancestors and mine had faced closely similar daily problems not only of survival, but of making survival acceptable, yet the solutions to those problems were bewilderingly different. Brown soup for breakfast, <b>sitting</b> shoeless and <b>cross-legged</b> on the floor in houses which, though glassless, were bright and warm, were never the Irish, nor indeed the English, way. Even the method of catching fish from the sea and the intimacies of personal hygiene were different in Japan. I was reminded of this when I began seriously to read some health economics before writing this paper. Again the problems were the same, but the approach of health economists to solving them was startlingly different from that of social medicine men. Although I was aware of the rationale of curves ofdemand and supply, the concepts ofmaximisation, opportunity costs, and the problems of measuring benefit, I was again unprepared for what I was to find. An example of the economist's unfamiliar approach is Grossman's proposal (1972) that health is an 'investment commodity', a form of capital stock with which one is born; that 'death occurs when the stock falls below a certain level, and [...] . that therefore individuals "choose " their length of life'.

30|$|The femoral neck {{fracture}} {{is probably}} the fracture for which there exists the larger number of methods of osteosynthesis. Internal fixation of femoral neck fracture is followed by certain incidence of fixation failure. Non-union may occur in one-third of patients, with higher rate in vertical or displaced fractures [14]. Number of methods of internal fixation when used alone have failed to achieve the desired end result. Osteoporosis directly influences degree of displacement and quality of internal fixation. The deficient bone stock and posterior comminution {{play a significant role}} in biological failure to unite the fracture. Age and sex of patient, osteoporosis, degree of displacement and quality of fracture reduction are the factors that have been found to affect the end result [15, 16]. The appropriate treatment for non-union of a femoral neck fracture depends on the age of the patient, his or her medical status, viability of the femoral head, size of the remnant femoral neck, osteoporosis, duration of the disease and finally the state of joint space. Considering the fact that the majority of patients with femoral neck fracture are over 60  years of age, have extreme osteoporosis and are poor surgical candidates, it is better to replace the femoral neck with a femoral prosthesis or a total joint replacement. In the case of infection of the joint with non-union of the femoral neck, when it is not possible to do total joint replacement, it is better to perform resection arthroplasty (Girdlestone procedure). In patients younger than 55  years who are in good general medical condition, with no osteoporosis and with a reasonable size of femoral neck and normal joint space, it is desirable to preserve the femoral head, particularly if the patient’s lifestyle and social and religious customs require squatting and <b>sitting</b> in a <b>cross-legged</b> position [17].|$|R

We investigated what is the capability for performing various HF activities, and whether high flexion activities increase the chance of aseptic loosening after HF-TKA. Methods: We retrospectively analysed 260 patients who underwent HF-TKA using the NexGen LPS Flex between 2001 and 2009. The mean follow-up was 6. 7 years (range, 5 – 13). We evaluated range of motion, Knee Society scores, WOMAC, and serial radiographs for aseptic loosening. Responses to questions on individual HF activities were recorded on 5 -point Likert scales based on difficulty (0 – 4). Patients were divided two groups based on their responses to squatting and kneeling, which were important weight-bearing HF activities in Asian population (HF group vs. non-HF group) for comparisons of aseptic loosening and clinical outcomes. Results: More than 80 % of patients positively responded for various HF activities. The capability of HF activities showed that <b>cross-legged</b> <b>sitting,</b> squatting, and kneeling were 97. 7, 51. 1 and 52. 7 % at the latest follow-up, respectively.

There was no significant difference of aseptic loosening based on HF activities (0. 8 % vs. 0 %, p = 0. 063).
