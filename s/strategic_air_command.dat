5|$|Following the {{development}} of the Glenn L. Martin Company bomber manufacturing plant in Bellevue at the beginning of World War II, the relocation of the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command</b> to the Omaha suburb in 1948 provided a major economic boost to the area.|$|E
5|$|For the {{majority}} of its operational lifetime, Loring was a heavy bomber, aerial refueling, and interception facility for military aircraft, equipment, and supplies first as part of <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command</b> (SAC) (1947–1992), then as part of the succeeding Air Combat Command (ACC) (1992–1994).|$|E
5|$|Hambleton had Top Secret {{access to}} <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command</b> {{operations}} {{and was an}} expert in surface-to-air missile countermeasures. The North Vietnamese Army may have possessed information about his presence in Vietnam and his capture would have meant a huge intelligence bonanza for the Soviet Union.|$|E
50|$|Active {{for over}} 60 years, the 28th was a {{component}} wing of <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> deterrent force throughout the Cold War.|$|R
50|$|The Fairchild Trophy was <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> top Bombardment Award, {{for which}} the Group {{administered}} flight checks and evaluated standardization and training activities.|$|R
50|$|The wing {{conducted}} strategic-bombardment training from 1946 to 1960, and air refueling from 1949 to 1960, to meet <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> (SAC) global commitments.|$|R
5|$|The base {{also came}} {{with its own}} {{newspaper}}, named Limelite. The on-base newspaper helped to provide readers with information on the USAF and <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command,</b> {{as well as information}} on the events happening around the facility.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the 20 {{years of}} {{foundational}} {{work by the}} bomber mafia resulted in {{the separation of the}} United States Air Force from the Army to become an independent military arm. The bomber mafia's strategic doctrine, changed by war and experience, helped shape the mission of the new Air Force and its <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{commander}} of the 3rd Air Division and later the Third Air Force, he was subordinate to United States Air Forces in Europe, but also {{had to deal with}} USAF headquarters and the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command.</b> He was also designated the point of contact for dealing with the British government. Despite his lowly rank of major general, he was able to hold his own in dealings with more senior British officers, and with senior British officials, including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Clement Attlee. His command was understaffed, lacked a clear mission, and there was no agreement with the British government regarding base rights or financial responsibilities. Nor was it easy dealing with his <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command</b> colleagues like Archie J. Old, Jr., who were not renowned for diplomatic skill. Johnson's deft touch was perhaps exemplified by his order that the Royal Air Force Ensign be flown over US bases in the UK alongside the flag of the United States.|$|E
50|$|Trained for <b>strategic</b> {{bombardment}} and <b>air</b> refueling {{operations to}} meet <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> global commitments, equipped with B-29 Superfortresses. Deployed to Sidi Slimane AB, French Morocco, 5 Oct-6 Nov 1952.|$|R
50|$|Active {{for over}} 40 years, the 380th Bombardment Wing was a {{component}} organization of <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> deterrent force during the Cold War, {{as a strategic}} bombardment wing.|$|R
50|$|The 397th Bombardment Wing was {{organized}} in 1963 {{as a component}} organization of <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> deterrent force during the Cold War. It was inactivated when Dow closed.|$|R
5|$|F-84s were {{assigned}} to the 27th Fighter Wing, 27th Fighter Escort Wing, 27th Strategic Fighter Wing, 31st Fighter Escort Wing, 127th Fighter Day Wing, 127th Fighter Escort Wing, 127th Strategic Fighter Wing, 407th Strategic Fighter Wing and the 506th Strategic Fighter Wing of the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command</b> from 1947 through 1958.|$|E
5|$|In April 1946, Kenney {{became the}} first {{commander}} of the newly formed <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command</b> (SAC), but his performance in the role was criticized, and he was shifted to become commander of the Air University, a position he held from October 1948 until his retirement from the Air Force in September 1951.|$|E
5|$|In {{the postwar}} era, the 509th Composite Group {{was one of}} the {{original}} ten bombardment groups assigned to <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command</b> on 21 March 1946 and the only one equipped with Silverplate B-29 Superfortress aircraft capable of delivering atomic bombs. It was standardized as a bombardment group and redesignated the 509th Bombardment Group, Very Heavy, on 10 July 1946.|$|E
50|$|At this point, the White House is {{completely}} evacuated, with the President, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other White House officials evacuated onto the National Emergency Airborne Command Post plane with the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> airborne command center Looking Glass in accompaniment, and the Emergency Broadcast System is activated.|$|R
5000|$|The 17th <b>Air</b> Division (Provisional) <b>commanded</b> {{primarily}} provisional <b>air</b> refueling wings {{created from}} active-duty KC-135/KC-10 {{units of the}} <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> Fifteenth <b>Air</b> Force and SAC Air National Guard KC-135 units deployed within the CENTAF AOR.|$|R
50|$|From March 1954 until August 1955, Saxer was {{assigned}} to the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> 6th Aviation Depot Squadron, in French Morocco, as an electronics officer; mechanical officer; and special weapons assembly section supervisor.|$|R
5|$|While at Paramount, in 1955, he {{produced}} the highly commercially successful <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command,</b> starring James Stewart. After {{the success of}} <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command,</b> Paramount obtained the rights to The Sons of Katie Elder, and assigned the project to Briskin to produce, with Alan Ladd starring. However, when Ladd brought out {{the remainder of his}} contract with Paramount, the film was put on hold, and would not be produced until 1965, by a different producer, Hal B. Wallis. In May 1956, Briskin asked to be released from the final two years of his agreement with Paramount, to which the studio agreed. The one condition was that Briskin finish work on his remaining film commitment to the studio, The Joker is Wild, starring Frank Sinatra, which was being produced by an independent film company, A.M.B.L. Productions, under an agreement with Paramount.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{the army}} air base was {{reactivated}} as Amarillo Air Force Base and expanded {{to accommodate a}} <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command</b> B-52 Stratofortress wing. The arrival of servicemen and their families ended the city's depression. Between 1950 and 1960, Amarillo's population grew from 74,443 to 137,969. However, the closure of Amarillo Air Force Base on December 31, 1968, contributed to a decrease in population to 127,010 by 1970.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council {{approved}} MC 48, a key {{document in}} the evolution of NATO nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized that NATO would have to use atomic weapons from the outset of a war with the Soviet Union whether or not the Soviets chose to use them first. This gave SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic use of nuclear weapons as existed for the commander-in-chief of the US <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command.</b>|$|E
50|$|In March 1946 Lieutenant-Colonel Gillem was {{a member}} of the {{original}} cadre that set up the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> headquarters at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. Gillem graduated from <b>Air</b> <b>Command</b> and Staff School in 1948. He was then seconded to the CIA from 1948 to 1950.|$|R
50|$|In June 1955, Nazzaro was {{appointed}} commander of <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> 15th <b>Air</b> Division in Morocco. He {{returned to the}} United States in July 1957 and was assigned to U.S. Air Force Headquarters as director of personnel planning.|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} {{flew the}} Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter, providing air refueling to USAF units {{until it was}} inactivated in October 1962. In 1961, the squadron was selected to represent Second <b>Air</b> Force in <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> annual bombing competition.|$|R
5|$|The Bold Orion missile was {{developed}} {{as part of}} Weapons System 199, initiated by the United States Air Force (USAF) {{in response to the}} U.S. Navy's Polaris program, with funding authorised by the United States Congress in 1957. The purpose of WS-199 was the development of technology that would be used in new strategic weapons for the USAF's <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command,</b> not to deliver operational weapons; a primary emphasis was on proving the feasibility of an air-launched ballistic missile.|$|E
5|$|The Thunderjet {{became the}} USAF's primary strike {{aircraft}} during the Korean War, flying 86,408 sorties and destroying 60% of all ground {{targets in the}} war as well as eight Soviet-built MiG fighters. Over half of the 7,524 F-84s produced served with NATO nations, {{and it was the}} first aircraft to fly with the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds demonstration team. The USAF <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command</b> had F-84 Thunderjets in service from 1948 through 1957.|$|E
5|$|In April 1946, Kenney {{became the}} first {{commander}} of the newly formed <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command</b> (SAC). He was encouraged by Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington {{to join him in}} the political battle surrounding the establishment of an independent United States Air Force. Separately, the two men gave promotional speeches around the country. As a result, SAC's efficiency suffered. On 8 May 1946, Kenney publicly presented the Medal of Honor to the family of Thomas B. McGuire, Jr, the second-highest scoring US fighter pilot, who had been killed in action.|$|E
50|$|Hunter AFB was {{assigned}} to the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> (SAC) Second <b>Air</b> Force. Two major SAC medium bombardment wings were assigned to Hunter during the 1950s. Both came under the 38th Air Division which was also headquartered at Hunter.|$|R
5000|$|Construction of <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> Weapons Storage Area at Goose Air Base {{was officially}} {{completed}} in 1954. [...] The area {{was surrounded by}} two fences, topped with barbed wire. It was the highest security area in Goose Air Base and comprised ...|$|R
50|$|In 1951, pilot {{training}} was discontinued {{and replaced with}} academic and flight training for navigators, radar operators, and bombardiers, with particular emphasis for those officers slated for eventual assignment to <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> B-36 Peacemaker and its ever-increasing fleet of B-47 Stratojets.|$|R
5|$|<b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command</b> {{found itself}} in an uncomfortable position; bombers had been tuned for {{efficiency}} at high speeds and altitudes, performance that had been purchased at great cost in both engineering and financial terms. Before the B-70 was to replace the B-52 in the long-range role, SAC had introduced the B-58 Hustler to replace the Boeing B-47 Stratojet in the medium-range role. The Hustler was expensive to develop and purchase, and required enormous amounts of fuel and maintenance {{in comparison to the}} B-47. It was estimated that it cost three times as much to operate as the much larger and longer-ranged B-52.|$|E
5|$|The Air Force did {{possess an}} {{aircraft}} which had an all-weather capability, radar-guided bombing equipment, and awesome destructive potential – the B-52 Stratofortress. The civilian administration, however, never considered utilizing the big bombers (whose operations remained {{under the control}} of the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command)</b> very far north of the DMZ, believing that it was too overt an escalation. Air Force Chief of Staff John P. McConnell also opposed sending the bombers into the air defense environment in the north and limited B-52 strikes to Route Package One.|$|E
5|$|The Joint Chiefs of Staff {{issued a}} {{directive}} in January 1948 for the modification of 225 B-29, B-50, and B-36 bombers to carry nuclear weapons, along with eight C-97 Stratofreighter aircraft to carry bomb assembly teams. There were already 32 Silverplate B-29s in service with the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command,</b> so the Air Materiel Command {{was directed to}} carry out Saddletree modifications on a further 80 B-29s, 36 B-50As, 23 B-50Bs and 18 B-36Bs. The B-36A could not carry nuclear weapons without major modifications.|$|E

Examples: 1st Fighter Wing, 21st Space Wing, and the <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> 509th Bomb Wing. All constituted wings have one, two, or three digits in their numerical designations.|$|R
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{came under}} <b>Strategic</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Command's</b> 7th <b>Air</b> Division, with the 3909th Combat Support Group as its administrative unit on the base, {{responsible for all}} non-flying activities as well as maintenance and logistical support of the flying units attached to RAF Greenham Common.|$|R
50|$|The unit {{initially}} {{arrived at}} Seymour Johnson in October 1985 {{as a small}} advance team until October 1986.
