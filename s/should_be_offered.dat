5|$|Knights of the Old Republic II was {{developed}} by Obsidian Entertainment and published by LucasArts. It is the sequel to BioWare's Knights of the Old Republic, and it uses the same Odyssey Engine as the original game. BioWare suggested that Obsidian <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> the Knights of the Old Republic license due to their familiarity with Obsidian's past work and the good {{relationship between the two}} developers, as well as due to finding LucasArts' development schedule for the sequel to be too tight. The game was released in PC and Xbox versions, but due to the Xbox version being released two months prior to the PC version, it has multiple unfixed bugs.|$|E
5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} who do {{not feel}} well despite optimal levothyroxine dosing may request adjunctive treatment with liothyronine. A 2012 guideline from the European Thyroid Association recommends that support <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> {{with regards to the}} chronic nature of the disease and that other causes of the symptoms should be excluded. Addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially only for a trial period of 3 months, and in a set ratio to the current dose of levothyroxine. The guideline explicitly aims to enhance the safety of this approach and to counter its indiscriminate use.|$|E
5|$|Early in development, it {{was decided}} that the Jaguar <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> for export. In 1969, while still in the {{prototype}} stage of development, formal approaches had been made to Switzerland, India, Japan, Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, promoting the aircraft for sale. Japan began negotiations towards licensed production of the Jaguar, but these plans failed {{in part because of the}} high royalty payments sought by SEPECAT. A proposal for Turkey to construct Jaguars under licence for their own air force also did not come to fruition. Attempts to export to Kuwait and Pakistan did not transfer into orders. Kuwait initially ordered 50 Jaguars and 16 Mirage 5s, but instead firmed up for F1s. Pakistan approached SEPECAT after the US refused to sell their aircraft of choice, the LTV A-7 Corsair II, due to an arms embargo; Pakistan eventually opted for Mirage 5s.|$|E

50|$|Von der Decken's {{hornbill}} is omnivorous, taking insects, {{fruit and}} seeds. It feeds {{mainly on the}} ground and will form flocks outside the breeding season. In captivity the Von Der Decken hornbill will readily eat papaya, cantaloupe, blueberries, bananas, and apples. Live food such as crickets and mealworms <b>should</b> also <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> daily. Small rodents are readily taken but <b>should</b> only <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> {{two or three times a}} week.|$|R

25|$|After {{obtaining a}} sexual history, a {{healthcare}} provider should encourage risk reduction by providing prevention counseling. Prevention counseling {{is most effective}} if provided in a nonjudgmental and empathetic manner appropriate to the person's culture, language, gender, sexual orientation, age, and developmental level. Prevention counseling for STIs <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> to all sexually active adolescents and to all adults who have received a diagnosis, have had an STI in the past year, or have multiple sex partners.|$|E
25|$|Screening for rubella {{susceptibility}} {{by history}} of vaccination or by serology is recommended in the United States {{for all women}} of childbearing age at their first preconception counseling visit to reduce incidence of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). It is recommended that all susceptible non-pregnant {{women of childbearing age}} <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> rubella vaccination. Due to concerns about possible teratogenicity, use of MMR vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy. Instead, susceptible pregnant women should be vaccinated as soon as possible in the postpartum period.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{inherent}} {{common law}} right to legal representation before a domestic tribunal. A tribunal has the discretion to admit either a legally qualified or unqualified counsel {{to assist the}} person appearing before it, based on {{the facts of the}} case. When assessing whether a party <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> legal assistance, the adjudicator should first ask whether the right to be heard applies, and, secondly, whether counsel's assistance is needed for an effective hearing given the subject matter, bearing in mind the consequences of such a denial.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{relative}} {{carrying capacity}} of resources {{was used to}} analyze the dynamic changes of Dongting Lake’s flood detention basin. The relative carrying capacity of resources of flood detention basin compared with Hunan province from 2004 to 2011 was calculated. The results shown that the flood detention basin is in population relatively surplus state, but its severe overloading in economy resources. The consultation was drawn as the economic compensation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>offer</b> by downstream areas. Flood detention basin should transform economic growth mode, strict control population in resources lack and environmental vulnerability areas <b>should</b> <b>be</b> taken to reduce population growth pressures on resources...|$|R

25|$|Important {{forms of}} {{intangible}} rewards include praise, recognition and rewards. Intangible rewards are ones from which an employee does not derive any material gain. Such rewards {{have the greatest}} impact when they soon follow the desired behavior and are {{closely tied to the}} performance. If an organization wants to use praise or other intangible rewards effectively, praise <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> for a high level of performance and for things that they employee has control over. Some studies have shown that praise can be as effective as tangible rewards.|$|E
25|$|The {{guidelines}} {{also say}} women aged between 40 and 42 <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> one cycle of IVF on the NHS {{if all of}} the following additional criteria are also met: They have never had IVF treatment before, have no evidence of low ovarian reserve (this is when eggs in the ovary are low in number or low in quality) and have been informed of the additional implications of IVF and pregnancy at this age. However, if tests show IVF is the only treatment likely to help them get pregnant, women should be referred for IVF straight away.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{disagreed}} with the majority's view that Congress had consented to {{the transfer of the}} two counties when it debated the proposed West Virginia constitution. There was nothing in the debates to ever suggest that, he wrote. What Congress agreed to was that the two counties <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> the chance to join West Virginia {{by the time of the}} new state's admission to union with the United States. These conditions had not been met by the time of admission, and thus no transfer could be constitutionally made. Congress had not agreed to additional legislative acts of transfer, and thus they could not be made without Virginia's assent (which was now withdrawn).|$|E

25|$|In 2014, {{the high}} court {{addressed}} the issue of whether it could sanction a judge without a formal recommendation from the JSC. In this case, a District Court judge had voluntarily admitted his misconduct, and the JSC recommended public censure to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held that it could accept the JSC's recommendation, but was not bound by it. It could, if it wished, impose a harsher sanction (and did so). However, the court also held that because the judge had voluntarily admitted misconduct but had not agreed to submit to sanction, the judge <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> the opportunity to withdraw his voluntarily admission. This would trigger a new, formal JSC investigation.|$|E
500|$|Locker-Lampson also {{submitted}} {{a bill to}} parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein {{made a number of}} public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe. In one of his speeches he denounced Germany's treatment of Jews, {{while at the same time}} he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere. In his speech he described Einstein as a [...] "citizen of the world" [...] who <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> a temporary shelter in the U.K. Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, in the U.S., to become a resident scholar.|$|E
500|$|The Khazar Khagan {{sent his}} envoys to the Magyars {{shortly after they}} fled from Levedia and settled in Etelköz, {{according}} to Porphyrogenitus. The Khagan invited Levedi to a meeting, proposing to make Levedi the supreme head of the confederation of the Magyar tribes {{in exchange for the}} acceptance of his suzerainty. Instead of accepting the offer, Levedi suggested the new rank <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> to another voivode, Álmos, or the latter's son, Árpád. The Khagan accepted Levedi's proposal and upon his demand the Magyar chiefs proclaimed Árpád their head. According to Kristó and Spinei, Porphyrogenitus' report preserved the memory of the creation of a central office within the federation of the Magyar tribes. Róna-Tas says the story relates only a [...] "change of dynasty"; the fall of Levedi's family and the emergence of the Árpád dynasty. In contrast with Porphyrogenitus's story, the Gesta Hungarorum says it was not Árpád, but his father who was elected the first supreme prince of the Magyars.|$|E

5000|$|Leopard geckos <b>should</b> <b>be</b> fed insects, such as crickets and mealworms, {{because they}} are {{insectivores}} (they eat insects).

5000|$|The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) {{does not}} {{recommend}} routine testing for GBS, stating: [...] "Pregnant women <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> routine antenatal screening for group B streptococcus because evidence of its clinical and cost effectiveness remains uncertain." ...|$|R
500|$|The Yorkshire committee, {{prompted}} by the influential county president, Lord Hawke, approached Herbert Sutcliffe, one of the side's leading professionals. After Sutcliffe's provisional acceptance of the captaincy, controversy arose. Some members objected to the appointment on the traditional grounds that Sutcliffe was not an amateur; others felt that if a professional was to be appointed, the post <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> to the county's senior professional, Wilfred Rhodes, who had been playing much longer than Sutcliffe. [...] Rhodes himself was offended {{that he had not}} been approached. When Sutcliffe became aware of the controversy, he withdrew his acceptance. No offer was made to Rhodes, and the county subsequently appointed amateur William Worsley as captain. He was respected by the team but had little personal success, lasted for just two seasons, and was followed by two further short-term leaders. In 1933 Brian Sellers, a more competent amateur, was appointed and became the long-serving captain that Yorkshire had sought.|$|E
500|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of state courts accept {{that there must be}} a duty of care for there to be liability: the courts of Wisconsin, though, have stated that they have adopted Andrews' approach, and impose liability when there was a duty to any person, whether or not that person is the plaintiff. The Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965) amended the earlier formulation only slightly, but the third Restatement (2009), takes an approach closer to that of Andrews in focusing on whether the defendant engaged in an activity that carried a risk of harm to another (not necessarily the plaintiff), and on whether the defendant exercised reasonable care. The new formulation makes foreseeability, or the scope of the risk, not a hurdle that must be overcome, as in Palsgraf, but a factor to be weighed with others when determining whether there was negligence. Thus, according to law professor David Owen in his 2009 article, [...] "the Restatement (Third) discards Judge Cardozo's elemental work in Palsgraf so long ago. And... also rejects Judge Andrew's [...] valuable insight that juries <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> a wide range of fairness factors, beginning with foreseeability, in figuring how far responsibility should extend".|$|E
500|$|Arguably {{the most}} notable resident, however, is Mary Elizabeth Wilson; a serial killer who {{achieved}} worldwide notoriety as the [...] "Merry Widow of Windy Nook". Wilson was born in Hebburn but lived with her first husband John Knowles, along with her lover, John Russell {{in the same house}} at Windy Nook for 43 years. Knowles died in 1955 and she married Russell five months later. He died two years later and both were attributed to natural causes. Wilson remarried again but her third marriage, to Oliver Leonard, lasted just twelve days and he died leaving £50 to his wife in his will. [...] A short time later, Wilson married for a fourth time to Ernest Wilson. At her wedding reception, Wilson joked to a guest that the sandwiches left over could be saved for the funeral. When Ernest died soon after, Wilson joked with the funeral director that she <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>offered</b> a trade discount for all of the trade she passed his way. Local residents heard of these comment and began speculating as to the spate of deaths, so that Police eventually exhumed Oliver Leonard and Ernest Wilson in 1958 and found traces of phosphorus caused by rat poison. Despite claiming that sexual stimulation pills were the source of the phosphorus, Wilson was convicted of both murders at Leeds in 1958 and sentenced to hang at Durham; the last woman to be so sentenced. Due to her age, her execution was commuted to a life sentence, and she died in Holloway prison in 1962. A later exhumation of her first two husbands also resulted in phosphorus being found, but Wilson died before she could be tried again.|$|E
