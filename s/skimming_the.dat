5|$|Skimmers are a {{small family}} of {{tropical}} tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and <b>skimming</b> <b>the</b> water for small fish.|$|E
5|$|Laridae is {{a family}} of medium to large seabirds, the gulls, terns, and skimmers. Gulls are {{typically}} grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and <b>skimming</b> <b>the</b> water for small fish.|$|E
5|$|Gulls are {{typically}} medium to large birds, usually gray or white, often with black markings {{on the head}} or wings. They have stout, stout, longish bills and webbed feet. The large species take up to four years to attain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small gulls. Terns are in general medium to large birds, typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. Skimmers are tropical and subtropical species. They have an elongated lower mandible. They feed by flying low over the water surface with the lower mandible <b>skimming</b> <b>the</b> water for small fish. Thirty-two species of Laridae have been recorded in North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Gulls are {{typically}} medium-to-large birds, usually gray or white, often with black markings {{on the head}} or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. The large species take up to four years to attain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small gulls. Terns are in general medium-to-large birds, typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. They have longish bills and webbed feet. They are lighter bodied and more streamlined than gulls and look elegant in flight with long tails and long narrow wings. Skimmers are tropical and subtropical species. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use by flying low over the water surface <b>skimming</b> <b>the</b> water for small fish. Twenty-nine Laridae species have been recorded in South Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Pallid {{sturgeon}} {{are generally}} bottom feeders, <b>skimming</b> <b>the</b> sandy {{reaches of the}} various rivers and streams in their habitat. Though {{little is known about}} the precise eating habits of the species, they are thought to be opportunistic feeders. One study which examined the contents from the stomachs of juvenile pallid sturgeon revealed that their diets were seasonally dependent. Various insects were consumed during some seasons and various fish species during others. These results support the description of the pallid sturgeon's eating habits as opportunistic. Fish is a more important dietary staple for pallid sturgeon than it is for shovelnose sturgeon. In one study comparing dietary tendencies between adult shovelnose sturgeon and immature pallid sturgeon, the pallid sturgeon was found to consume far greater numbers of small fish such as cyprinids (minnows). In another study conducted in the upper Missouri River region, an examination of the stomach contents of hatchery-reared pallid sturgeon showed that 82% of the wet weight was small fish and the balance was mosquito-like insects, mayflies, and caddis flies and small amounts of detritus and plant material.|$|E

25|$|Beriev {{developed}} unique {{fire-fighting equipment}} for the Be-200, allowing it to scoop water while <b>skimming</b> <b>the</b> water surface at 90-95% of takeoff speed. This system was developed using a specially modified Be-12P, coded '12 Yellow'. After installation of the fire-fighting system, the aircraft was registered RA-00046 and given the designation Be-12P-200. This modified Be-12 was used to develop both the fire-fighting system and methods of operation.|$|E
25|$|The Miller {{process was}} invented by Francis Bowyer Miller in 1860's Australia. It is able to refine gold up to 99.5% purity. The process {{involves}} blowing a stream of chlorine gas over and through a crucible filled with molten impure gold. Impurities in the gold form chlorides before the gold does and these insoluble salts are removed from the melt by <b>skimming</b> <b>the</b> surface.|$|E
25|$|Variations on {{the flavor}} are gained by adding root {{vegetables}} such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves or tomatoes and black pepper. The soup {{should be brought}} slowly {{to a boil and}} then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by <b>skimming</b> <b>the</b> drops of fat {{off the top of the}} soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.|$|E

500|$|Clarke {{was never}} {{sure if she}} would finish her novel or {{if it would be}} published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, {{beginning}} at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule. Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together. Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not for the reader, [...] "clung to this method" [...] "because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [...] would lack depth, and I would just be <b>skimming</b> <b>the</b> surface of what I could do. But if I had known {{it was going to take}} me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next."

500|$|Some [...] of {{floating}} containment boom had been deployed {{to contain the}} oil by the next day. Boats and helicopters identified patches of slick in the ocean so cleanup vessels could mop up the oil. More than a dozen vessels corralling and <b>skimming</b> <b>the</b> oil from the water were working in the days immediately following the spill. Three days after the spill more than 650 workers and 17 boats were cleaning the shoreline, gathering up an oily water mixture from the ocean, and hauling away more than [...] of oil-contaminated soil, sand and vegetation from the coastal bluff. A month after the spill, efforts continued to clean the [...] portion of shoreline that was most heavily damaged. The sandstone cliff face along with large boulders that were splashed by the oil {{coming out of the}} culvert were difficult to clean. While sandy beaches farther south were inundated with tar balls, the beaches and rocky shoreline south of the spill had been drenched with a slick of fresh crude oil that had not been in the ocean long enough to be altered into tar balls by the wind and waves.|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{spent the}} next ten years working on the novel in her spare time, while editing cookbooks {{full-time}} for Simon & Schuster in Cambridge. She also published stories in Starlight 2 and Starlight 3; according to the New York Times Magazine, her work was known and appreciated by a small group of fantasy fans and critics on the internet. She was never sure, however, if she would finish her novel or if it would be published. Clarke tried to write for three hours each day, beginning at 5:30am, but struggled to keep this schedule.

This exploit did not amuse the authorities, and for his return journey he was obliged to taxy the aircraft down the Thames as far as Shadwell Basin, where on attempting take off the aircraft sideslipped, damaging one of the floats: the aircraft was returned to Eastchurch by road.|$|E
