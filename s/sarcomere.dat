5|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a common}} condition (prevalence >1:500) characterized by abnormal thickening of the ventricular muscle, classically in the intraventricular septal wall. HCM {{is described as a}} disease of the <b>sarcomere,</b> because mutations in the contractile proteins of the <b>sarcomere</b> have been identified in about half of patients with HCM. The cTnC mutations that have been associated with HCM are A8V, L29Q, A31S, C84Y, D145E. In all cases, the mutation was identified in a single patient, so additional genetic testing is needed to confirm or refute the clinical significance of these mutations. With most of these mutations (and with HCM-associated thin filament mutations in general), an increase in cardiac calcium sensitivity has been observed.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of a}} {{synthesized}} protein can {{be measured}} {{by the number of}} amino acids it contains and by its total molecular mass, which is normally reported in units of daltons (synonymous with atomic mass units), or the derivative unit kilodalton (kDa). The average size of protein increases from Archaea, Bacteria to Eukaryote (283, 311, 438 residues and 31, 34, 49 kDa respecitvely) due bigger number of protein domains constituting proteins in higher organisms. For instance, yeast proteins are on average 466 amino acids long and 53 kDa in mass. The largest known proteins are the titins, a component of the muscle <b>sarcomere,</b> with a molecular mass of almost 3,000 kDa and a total length of almost 27,000 amino acids.|$|E
5|$|The calcium {{sensitivity}} of the <b>sarcomere,</b> that is, the calcium concentration at which muscle contraction occurs, is directly determined by the calcium binding affinity of cNTnC. To date, there are no known post-translational modifications of cTnC that impact its calcium binding affinity. However, calcium binding by cNTnC is a dynamic process that can be impacted by the closed-to-open conformational equilibrium of cNTnC, the domain positioning of cNTnC, or the relative availability of cTnI148-159, the physiologic binding partner of cNTnC. The closed-to-open equilibrium of cNTnC can be shifted towards the open state by small compounds (see section below on troponin-binding drugs). Domain positioning of cNTnC can be impacted by phosphorylation of cTnI, of which the most important site in humans is Ser22/Ser23. The availability of cTnI148-159 depends on the blocked-closed-open equilibrium of tropomyosin on actin, which can be impacted by any interactions involving the thin filament, including actin-myosin cross-bridging and length dependent activation (also known as stretch activation or the Frank Starling law of the heart). All of these processes can be impacted by mutations (see section below on disease-causing mutations).|$|E
40|$|A contraction-induced injury {{results when}} an {{activated}} skeletal muscle {{or a single}} fiber is stretched in a ‘lengthening contraction’. This type of injury to muscle fibers is {{a leading cause of}} the loss of mobility that is associated with old age. Manifestations of the injury revealed by electron microscopy show focally disrupted single <b>sarcomeres,</b> or small groups of <b>sarcomeres,</b> that are surrounded by intact <b>sarcomeres.</b> The purpose of this dissertation was to study the dynamic behavior of <b>sarcomeres</b> during lengthening contractions of single muscle fibers. The working hypothesis was that contraction-induced injury occurs during a lengthening contraction when <b>sarcomeres</b> undergo elongation at varying rates and those lengthened at the highest rates reach longer lengths and are damaged. To test this hypothesis, a laser scanning system was developed that recorded rapidly (500 s− 1) the lengths of <b>sarcomeres</b> contained in each of 20 contiguous regions along ~ 1 mm segments of a fiber. The fiber segments were obtained from soleus muscles of adult male rats and the membranes of the fibers were permeabilized chemically. The experiments performed with the laser scanning apparatus, indicated that: (i) during a lengthening contraction, the regions of fibers that contain the longer <b>sarcomeres</b> {{at the onset of the}} lengthening elongate more compared with the regions that contain shorter sarcomeres; (ii) lengthening contractions increased the variability in the lengths of <b>sarcomeres</b> in relaxed fibers; and (iii) during a lengthening contraction, within any given fiber region, the rate of elongation of <b>sarcomeres</b> was stable, but different regions stretched at different rates as the contraction proceeded. The present findings support the hypothesis that, within single fibers, non-uniformities develop in the lengths of <b>sarcomeres</b> that are increased by a lengthening contraction. The finding that all fiber regions elongate at stable rates during lengthening contractions contradicts a previous hypothesis that during lengthening contractions, the longest <b>sarcomeres</b> undergo rapid and sudden elongation to extreme lengths. The conclusion is that during lengthening contractions, the longer <b>sarcomeres</b> in series with shorter <b>sarcomeres</b> undergo elongation at higher velocities and upon return to original length, structural elements within some of these longer <b>sarcomeres</b> are functionally compromised...|$|R
5000|$|Cardiac and {{skeletal}} {{muscles are}} [...] "striated" [...] {{in that they}} contain <b>sarcomeres</b> that are packed into highly regular arrangements of bundles; the myofibrils of smooth muscle cells are not arranged in <b>sarcomeres</b> and so are not striated. While the <b>sarcomeres</b> in skeletal muscles are arranged in regular, parallel bundles, cardiac muscle <b>sarcomeres</b> connect at branching, irregular angles (called intercalated discs). Striated muscle contracts and relaxes in short, intense bursts, whereas smooth muscle sustains longer or even near-permanent contractions.|$|R
40|$|Background: Effects of extramuscular {{connective}} tissues on muscle force (experimentally measured) and {{lengths of}} <b>sarcomeres</b> (modeled) were investigated in rat. It {{was hypothesized that}} changes of muscle-relative position affect the distribution of lengths of <b>sarcomeres</b> within muscle fibers. Method of approach: The position of extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL) relative to intact extramuscular connective tissues of the anterior crural compartment was manipulated without changing its muscle-tendon complex length. Results: Significant effects of EDL muscle relative position on proximal and distal EDL forces were found, indicating changes of extramuscular myofascial force transmission. EDL isometric force exerted at its proximal and distal tendons differed significantly. Finite-element modeling showed that the distribution of lengths of <b>sarcomeres</b> is altered by changes of muscle-relative position. Conclusions: It is concluded that forces exerted on a muscle via extramuscular myofascial pathways augment distributions of lengths of <b>sarcomeres</b> within that muscle...|$|R
25|$|Titin {{is a large}} {{abundant}} protein of striated muscle. Titin's primary {{functions are}} to stabilize the thick filament, center it between the thin filaments, prevent overstretching of the <b>sarcomere,</b> and to recoil the <b>sarcomere</b> like a spring after it is stretched. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the <b>sarcomere,</b> respectively, so that a single titin molecule spans half {{the length of a}} <b>sarcomere.</b> Titin also contains binding sites for muscle-associated proteins so it serves as an adhesion template for the assembly of contractile machinery in muscle cells. It has also been identified as a structural protein for chromosomes. Considerable variability exists in the I-band, the M-line and the Z-disc regions of titin. Variability in the I-band region contributes to the differences in elasticity of different titin isoforms and, therefore, to the differences in elasticity of different muscle types. Of the many titin variants identified, five are described with complete transcript information available.|$|E
25|$|The trigger muscles {{found in}} O. bauri {{are also found}} in the fastest {{synchronous}} muscles of cicadas. The muscles appear to have been sculpted for fast contraction. This is because the <b>sarcomere</b> length, which is the fundamental unit of muscle structure, is similar in length.|$|E
25|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} is {{the most}} common cause of sudden death in young people, including trained athletes, and is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins of the cardiac <b>sarcomere.</b> Mutations in the Troponin C gene (TNNC1) are a rare genetic cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A recent study has indicated that a frameshift mutation (c.363dupG or p.Gln122AlafsX30) in Troponin C was the cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (and sudden cardiac death) in a 19-year-old male.|$|E
40|$|This review {{focuses on}} recent {{developments}} in the molecular mechanisms by which Ca activates cardiac <b>sarcomeres</b> and how these mechanisms play out in the cardiac cycle. I emphasize the role of mechanisms intrinsic to the <b>sarcomeres</b> as significant determinants of systolic elastance and ventricular stiffening during ejection. Data are presented supporting the idea that processes intrinsic to the thin filaments may promote cooperative activation of the <b>sarcomeres</b> and {{be an important factor}} in maintaining and modifying systolic elastance. Application of these ideas to translational medicine and rationale drug design forms an important rationale for detailed understanding of these processes...|$|R
25|$|Desmin IFs are {{structural}} {{components of}} the <b>sarcomeres</b> in muscle cells.|$|R
50|$|Actinin is a microfilament protein. α-Actinin is {{necessary}} for the attachment of actin filaments to the Z-lines in skeletal muscle cells, and to the dense bodies in smooth muscle cells. The functional protein is an anti-parallel dimer, which cross-links the thin filaments in adjacent <b>sarcomeres,</b> and therefore coordinates contractions between <b>sarcomeres</b> in the horizontal axis.|$|R
25|$|The actin {{protein is}} found in both the {{cytoplasm}} and the cell nucleus. Its location is regulated by cell membrane signal transduction pathways that integrate the stimuli that a cell receives stimulating the restructuring of the actin networks in response. In Dictyostelium, phospholipase D {{has been found to}} intervene in inositol phosphate pathways. Actin filaments are particularly stable and abundant in muscle fibres. Within the <b>sarcomere</b> (the basic morphological and physiological unit of muscle fibres) actin is present in both the I and A bands; myosin is also present in the latter.|$|E
25|$|The cloning of {{the human}} MYBPC3 cDNA and {{localization}} of the gene on human chromosome 11p11.2 has assisted the structure and function of cMyBP-C. MYBPC3 became therefore the “best” candidate gene for the CMH4 locus for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that was initially mapped by the group of Schwartz. MYBPC3 mutations segregating in families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have been identified. MYBPC3 was thus the fourth gene for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, following MYH7, encoding β-myosin heavy chain, TNNT2 and TPM1, encoding cardiac troponin T and α-tropomyosin, respectively, earmarking hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as a disease of the <b>sarcomere.</b>|$|E
25|$|The myosin-binding protein C, cardiac-type is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the MYBPC3 gene. cMyBP-C is a myosin-associated protein that binds at 43nm {{intervals}} along the myosin thick filament backbone, stretching for 200nm {{on either side}} of the M-line within the crossbridge-bearing zone (C-region) of the A band in striated muscle. The approximate stoichiometry of cMyBP-C along the thick filament is 1 per 9-10 myosin molecules, or 37 cMyBP-C molecules per thick filament. In addition to myosin, cMyBP-C also binds titin and actin. The cMyBP-C isoform expressed in cardiac muscle differs from those expressed in slow and fast skeletal muscle (MYBPC1 and MYBPC2, respectively) by three features: (1) an additional immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain on the N-terminus, (2) a linker region between the second and third Ig domains, and (3) an additional loop in the sixth Ig domain. cMyBP-C appears necessary for normal order, filament length and lattice spacing within the structure of the <b>sarcomere.</b>|$|E

30|$|Further {{histological}} {{analysis of}} transverse sections (Fig. 3 c) demonstrated substantial deposits of connective tissues or fibrosis, {{as demonstrated by}} MSB staining, while immunofluorescent staining for fibrin(ogen) demonstrated marked co-localization to areas of necrotic <b>sarcomeres</b> in plasminogen deficient animals. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining detected substantial F 4 / 80 + cellular infiltrate surrounding necrotic <b>sarcomeres</b> in plasminogen deficient animals, but limited F 4 / 80 + cells within regenerated <b>sarcomeres</b> of control ASO treated animals. Taken together, these results indicated that following peri-elbow injury, an investigator-induced plasminogen deficiency, is sufficient to induce characteristically similar impaired soft tissue healing seen clinically in patients following traumatic elbow injuries.|$|R
2500|$|... cMyBP-C is not {{essential}} for <b>sarcomere</b> formation during embryogenesis, but is crucial for <b>sarcomere</b> organization and maintenance of normal cardiac function. Absence of cMyBP-C (Mybpc3-targeted knock-out mice) results in severe cardiac hypertrophy, increased heart-weight-to-body-weight-ratios, enlargement of ventricles, increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and depressed diastolic and systolic function. Histologically, Mybpc3-targeted knock-out hearts display structural rearrangements with cardiac myocyte disarray and increased interstitial fibrosis similar to patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, without obvious alterations in shape or size of single cardiac myocytes. Ultrastructural examination revealed a loss of lateral alignment of adjacent myofibrils with their Z-lines misaligned.|$|E
2500|$|... cMyBP-C {{regulates the}} {{positioning}} of myosin and actin for interaction and {{acts as a}} tether to the myosin S1 heads, limiting their mobility. This results in a decreased number of crossbridges formed, which hinders force generation, due to its N-terminal C1-M-C2 region interacting with the myosin-S2 domain. Furthermore, cMyBP-C contributes to the regulation of cardiac contraction at short <b>sarcomere</b> length and is required for complete relaxation in diastole.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mutation}} {{alters the}} structure and function of skeletal muscles producing one of three forms of myopathy: type 3 nemaline myopathy, congenital myopathy with an excess of thin myofilaments (CM) and Congenital myopathy with fibre type disproportion (CMFTD). Mutations have also been found that produce “core” myopathies). Although their phenotypes are similar, in addition to typical nemaline myopathy some specialists distinguish another type of myopathy called actinic nemaline myopathy. In the former, clumps of actin form instead of the typical rods. It is important to state that a patient can show {{more than one of}} these phenotypes in a biopsy. The most common symptoms consist of a typical facial morphology (myopathic faces), muscular weakness, a delay in motor development and respiratory difficulties. The course of the illness, its gravity and the age at which it appears are all variable and overlapping forms of myopathy are also found. [...] A symptom of nemalinic myopathy is that “Nemaline rods” appear in differing places in Type 1 muscle fibres. These rods are non-pathognomonic structures that have a similar composition to the Z disks found in the <b>sarcomere.</b>|$|E

50|$|Fiber {{length is}} also a key {{variable}} in muscle anatomy. Fiber length {{is the product of}} both the number of <b>sarcomeres</b> in series in the fiber and their individual lengths. As a fiber changes length, the individual <b>sarcomeres</b> shorten or lengthen, but the total number does not change (except on long timescales following exercise and conditioning). To standarize fiber length, length is measured {{at the peak of the}} length-tension relationship (L0), ensuring all <b>sarcomeres</b> are at the same length. Fiber length (at L0) does not affect force generation, much as the strength of a chain is unaffected by the length. Similarly, increased fiber cross-section or multiple fibers increase the force, like having multiple chains in parallel. Velocity is affected in the reverse manner - because <b>sarcomeres</b> shorten at a certain percentage per second under a certain force, fibers with more <b>sarcomeres</b> will have higher absolute (but not relative) velocities. Muscles with short fibers will have higher PCSA per unit muscle mass, thus greater force production, while muscle with long fibers will have lower PCSA per unit muscle mass, thus lower force production. However, muscles with longer fibers will shorten at greater absolute speeds than a similar muscle with shorter fibers.|$|R
40|$|The embryo of a {{tarsonemid mite}} {{was found to}} be {{suitable}} for in vivo observations of muscle development by polarization microscopy. The four dorsal muscles of the metapodosoma each contain three <b>sarcomeres,</b> the anterior two of which can be seen clearly. These <b>sarcomeres</b> can be identified and followed during much of their development. <b>Sarcomeres</b> are about 2. 5 micra long when first detected and increase in length until they are about 10 micra long. The change in length is associated with a slow, approximately constant rate of increase in the length of the A region, and an initially slow then much more rapid increase in the length of the I band. Preceding the period when the I band elongates rapidly there is an increase in the diameter of the muscle fibers and an increase in the retardation of the A band. A, I, Z, and H bands are visible during most of these changes. The change in A band length has been interpreted in terms of the growth of the A filaments which have been observed by electron microscopy in muscles of other animals. It is suggested that the exceptionally long <b>sarcomeres</b> in this mite result from the early fixing of the number of <b>sarcomeres</b> in a given muscle fiber...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to test whether {{mechanical}} strain uniquely regulates muscle fibre atrophy/hypertrophy and adaptation of the number of <b>sarcomeres</b> in series within mature muscle fibres in vitro. Mature single muscle fibres from Xenopus laevis illiofibularis muscle were cultured (4 - 97 days) while kept at negative strain (∼ 20 % below passive slack length, 'short fibres') or at positive strain (∼ 5 % over passive slack length, 'long fibres'). Before and after culture the number of <b>sarcomeres</b> in series was determined using laser diffraction. During culture, twitch and tetanic force characteristics were measured every day. Survival time of long fibres was substantially less than that of short fibres. Of the long fibres 40 % died or became inexcitable within 1 week, whereas this did not occur for short fibres. During culture, twitch and tetanic force of all short fibres increased substantially. Regression analysis showed that the post-culture number of <b>sarcomeres</b> in series was not significantly changed compared to the number before culture. It is concluded that culture at negative strain does not result in atrophy or a reduction of the number of <b>sarcomeres</b> in series, even after 97 days. For the long fibres we did not detect any hypertrophy as tetanic force remained stable or decreased slowly, while twitch force varied. Regression analysis of the change of the number of <b>sarcomeres</b> in series {{as a function of the}} culture time showed a positive slope (P = 0. 054). Two out of four long fibres that were cultured for at least 2 weeks showed an increase in the number of <b>sarcomeres</b> of 4 - 5 %. Compared with in vivo adaptation to mechanical stimuli this is much less than would be expected. The data suggest that strain may not be the only factor that regulates hypertrophy and the number of <b>sarcomeres</b> in series. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|R

50|$|The {{structure}} of the <b>sarcomere</b> affects its function in several ways. The overlap of actin and myosin {{gives rise to the}} length-tension curve, which shows how <b>sarcomere</b> force output decreases if the muscle is stretched so that fewer cross-bridges can form or compressed until actin filaments interfere with each other. Length of the actin and myosin filaments (taken together as <b>sarcomere</b> length) affects force and velocity - longer sarcomeres have more cross-bridges and thus more force, but have a reduced range of shortening. Vertebrates display a very limited range of <b>sarcomere</b> lengths, with roughly the same optimal length (length at peak length-tension) in all muscles of an individual as well as between species. Arthropods, however, show tremendous variation (over seven-fold) in <b>sarcomere</b> length, both between species and between muscles in a single individual. The reasons for the lack of substantial <b>sarcomere</b> variability in vertebrates is not fully known.|$|E

Finally, desmin may be important in mitochondria function. When desmin is not functioning properly there is improper mitochondrial distribution, number, morphology and function. Since desmin links the mitochondria to the <b>sarcomere</b> it may transmit information about contractions and energy need and through this regulate the aerobic respiration rate of the muscle cell.|$|E
40|$|To {{answer the}} {{question}} whether the muscle contracture in patients with cerebral palsy is caused by overstretching of in-series <b>sarcomeres</b> we studied the active and passive force-length relationship of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle (FCU) in relation to its operating length range in 14 such patients with a flexion deformity of the wrist. Force-length relationship was measured intra-operatively using electrical stimulation, a force transducer, and a data-acquisition system. Muscle length was measured in maximally flexed and maximally extended position of the wrist. The spastic FCU was found to exert over 80 % of its maximum active force at maximal extension of the wrist and this indicates abundant overlap of the <b>sarcomeres.</b> At maximal wrist extension, FCU passive force corresponded with only 0. 7 - 18 % of maximum active force. Both findings imply that the FCU <b>sarcomeres</b> are not overstretched when the wrist is extended.
