40|$|AbstractTo {{observe the}} {{formation}} process of compound I in horseradish peroxidase (HRP), {{we developed a}} new freeze-quench device with ∼ 200 μs of the mixing-to-freezing time interval and observed the reaction between HRP and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). The developed device consists of a submillisecond <b>solution</b> <b>mixer</b> and rotating copper or silver plates cooled at 77 K; it freezes the small droplets of mixed solution {{on the surface of}} the rotating plates. The ultraviolet-visible spectra of the sample quenched at ∼ 1 ms after the mixing of HRP and H 2 O 2 suggest the formation of compound I. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the same reaction quenched at ∼ 200 μs show a convex peak at g= 2. 00, which is identified as compound I due to its microwave power and temperature dependencies. The absence of ferric signals in the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the quenched sample indicates that compound I is formed within ∼ 200 μs after mixing HRP and H 2 O 2. We conclude that the activation of H 2 O 2 in HRP at ambient temperature completes within ∼ 200 μs. The developed device can be generally applied to investigate the electronic structures of short-lived intermediates of metalloenzymes...|$|E

Next, an appropriate amount of GO {{corresponding to the}} desired weight percentage {{was taken from the}} stock solution and mixed with the GnP <b>solution.</b> Vortex <b>mixer</b> was subsequently used for dispersing the mixture to preserve the GO size. The pH was later adjusted using 1  M HCL and NaOH to reach the desired value while keeping the solution in stirring mode to promote homogenized chemical reaction.

In the past, RF designers have used passive down-conversion mixers to obtain the best overall linearity and spurious performance for their high performance receiver designs. There are several disadvantages when using discrete passive mixers in these designs. Passive mixers have insertion loss that requires compensation in either the RF or IF gain stages to establish the overall desired receiver noise figure performance. For these passive mixers, the user must not only consider the third-order input intercept points (IIP 3), but should also consider the output third-order intercept point (OIP 3) when comparing the performance to integrated mixers.

40|$|Robust {{control is}} {{an aspect of}} control theory which {{explicitly}} considers uncertainties and how they affect robust stability in the analysis and design of control decisions. A basic requirement for optimal robust guaranteed control in a real life scenario is the stabilization of systems {{in the presence of}} uncertainties or perturbations. In this thesis, the system uncertainties are embedded into a norm bounded uncertainty elements. The perturbation function is modelled as a class of nonlinear uncertainty influencing a neutral system with infinite delay. It is assumed to have delay in state and is input dependent; which implies the effect of control action can directly or indirectly influence the nonlinear perturbation function. In recognition of the fact that stability and controllability are fundamental in obtaining the optimal robust guaranteed cost control design for neutral functional integro-differential systems with infinite delays (NFDSID), total asymptotic stability results were developed using Razumikhin technique, unique properties of eigenvalues, and the uniform stability properties of the functional difference operator for neutral systems. The new results, obtained using Razumikhin’s technique, extend and complement basic stability results in neutral systems to NFDSID. Novel sufficient conditions were developed for the null controllability of nonlinear NFDSID when the controls are constrained. By exploring the knowledge gained through other controllability results; conditions are placed on the perturbation function. This guaranteed that, if the uncontrolled system is uniformly asymptotically stable, and the controlled system satisfies a full rank condition, then the control system is null controllable with constraint if it satisfies some algebraic conditions. The investigation of optimal robust guaranteed cost control method has resulted in a novel delay dependent stability criterion for a nonlinear NFDSID with a given quadratic cost function. The new design is based on a model transformation technique, Lyapunov matrix equation and Lyapunov-Razumikhin stability approach. The Lyapunov-Razumikhin technique is adopted for this investigation because it is considered more scalable for optimal robust guaranteed cost control design for NFDSID. It is demonstrated that a memory less feedback control can be synthesized appropriately to ensure: (i) the closed-loop systems robust stability, and (ii) guarantee that the closed-loop cost function value remains within a specified bound. The problem of designing the optimal guaranteed cost controller is also realized in terms of inequalities. The Lyapunov-Krasovskii method is used to obtain stability conditions in comparison to the Razumikhin method. This method leads to linear matrix inequality (LMI) for the delay-independent case which is known to be conservative. To illustrate the potential practical applicability of the theoretical results; a cascade connection of two fully filled chemical <b>solution</b> <b>mixers,</b> and an integrated lossless transmission line which has a capacitance, inductance, resistance and terminated by a nonlinear function are modelled. A neutral control system model for NFDSID is derived from each of these systems. Simulation studies on the transmission line system confirm the theoretical robust stability results. The new results and methods of analysis expounded in this thesis are explicit, computationally more effective than existing ones and will serve as a working document for the present and future generations in the comity of researchers and industries alike...|$|R

Passive mixers seldom have second order linearity performance as good as an integrated balanced mixer design, which is important for receiver half-IF spurious considerations. Because a mixer's linearity performance {{is directly related to}} the LO drive level, rather large LO injection signals must be generated and then routed on the PC board to the passive mixer's LO port. External RF stages are needed to amplify these signals making the whole design susceptible to both LO radiation and pickup. Finally, passive mixers typically lead to an all-discrete design resulting in higher cost, larger PC board space...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} highly integrated millimeter waves function in multilayer LTCC and Liquid Crystal Polymer technology. Both ceramic and organic technologies are candidate of choice for the 3 D integration, following the system-on-package concept, of compact, low cost, millimeter-wave high data rate wireless systems. Compact and easy-to-design passive functions such as directional filter and band pass filter have been demonstrated with excellent performances and high integration potential. Directional filter represents a fundamental device class enabling a compact hybrid passive <b>mixer</b> <b>solution</b> for millimeter wave direct modulator since they combine multiple filtering functions, reducing complexity while maintaining compactness. Easy implementation in standard LTCC technology has been demonstrated by using vertically coupling mechanism. Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) is a organic material that offers a unique combination of electrical, chemical and mechanical properties, enabling high frequency designs due to its ability to act as both the substrate and package for multilayer constructions. A band pass filter was designed to enable a low cost, very easy to design filtering solution to be integrated into a wireless millimeter-wave gigabit link system. The design exploits successfully the ripple of modified stepped impedance Tchebyscheff low pass filter combined with a rejection stub to create a wideband band-pass response center at 60 GHz. Insertion loss as low as 1. 5 dB has been measured demonstrating the potential of LCP for millimeter-wave applications. E I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA novel freeze-quench {{instrument}} with {{a characteristic}} «dead-time» of 137 ± 18 μs is reported. The prototype has several key features that {{distinguish it from}} conventional freeze-quench devices and provide a significant improvement in time resolution: (a) high operating pressures (up to 400 bar) result in a sample flow with high linear rates (up to 200 m s− 1); (b) tangential micro-mixer with an operating volume of ∼ 1 nl yields short mixing times (up to 20 μs); (c) fast transport between the mixer and the cryomedium results in short reaction times: the ageing <b>solution</b> exits the <b>mixer</b> as a free-flowing jet, and the chemical reaction occurs “in–flight” {{on the way to}} the cryomedium; (d) a small jet diameter (∼ 20 μm) and a high jet velocity (∼ 200 m s− 1) provide high sample-cooling rates, resulting in a short cryofixation time (up to 30 μs). The dynamic range of the freeze-quench device is between 130 μs and 15 ms. The novel tangential micro-mixer efficiently mixes viscous aqueous solutions, showing more than 95 % mixing at η≤ 4 (equivalent to protein concentrations up to 250 mg ml− 1), which makes it an excellent tool for the preparation of pre-steady state samples of concentrated protein solutions for spectroscopic structure analysis. The novel freeze-quench device is characterized using the reaction of binding of azide to metmyoglobin from horse heart. Reaction samples are analyzed using 77 K optical absorbance spectroscopy, and X–band EPR spectroscopy. A simple procedure of spectral analysis is reported that allows (a) to perform a quantitative analysis of the reaction kinetics and (b) to identify and characterize novel reaction intermediates. The reduction of dioxygen by the bo 3 -type quinol oxidase from Escherichia coli is assayed using the MHQ technique. In these pilot experiments, low-temperature optical absorbance measurements show the rapid oxidation of heme o 3 in the first 137 μs of the reaction, accompanied by the formation of an oxo-ferryl species. X-band EPR spectroscopy shows that a short-living radical intermediate is formed during the oxidation of heme o 3. The radical decays within ∼ 1 ms concomitant with the oxidation of heme b, and can be attributed to the PM reaction intermediate converting to the oxoferryl intermediate F. The general field of application of the freeze-quench methodology is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Copper(III) {{complexes}} of Gly 2 His, Ala 2 His, Aib 2 His, Gly 2 Ha, Aib 2 Ha, Gly 2 HisGly, and Aib 2 HisGly, where L-histidine (His) or histamine (Ha) is {{the third}} residue (Aib is α-aminoisobutyryl residue, Ala is the L-alanyl residue, and Gly is the glycyl residue) are characterized {{in terms of their}} oxidizing power, pKa values for amine deprotonation, rates of self-decomposition, oxidation products, and decomposition mechanisms. ^ The histidine containing copper(III) tripeptide complexes undergo very rapid oxidative decarboxylation. The reactivity of these complexes increases in the order Aib 2 His 3 ̆c Ala 2 His 3 ̆c Gly 2 His, which parallels the increase in reduction potential. The tripeptides complexes with histamine as the third residue and tetrapeptides complexes decompose via proton abstraction of the α-proton on the third residue. The rate of decomposition of Cu III(H- 2 Gly 2 Ha) + and Cu III(H- 2 Gly 2 HisGly) are general-base assisted with a Bronsted β values of 0. 59 and 0. 63, respectively. Cu III(H- 2 Gly 2 His) is 105 to 106 times more reactive than Cu III(H- 2 Gly 2 Ha) +; although, their reduction potentials are similar. The decomposition rate of Cu III(H- 2 Gly 2 HisGly) is 29 times greater than that of Cum(H- 2 Gly 2 Ha) + due to the more acid proton at the α position of Cu III(H- 2 Gly 2 HisGly). ^ Pulsed-Accelerated-Flow spectroscopy with Position-Resolved Observation (PAF-PRO) has been developed for the study of rapid reaction in solution. The PAF-PRO instrument has been calibrated for the measurement of first-order reaction with half-lives of 0. 06 to 4. 3 ms and second-order reactions with initial half-lives of 0. 4 to 1. 7 ms. The technique involves combining two reagents by flowing the two <b>solutions</b> through a <b>mixer</b> and into an observation cell while the solution flow velocity constantly changes during a short-lived pulse. Absorbance measurements are made perpendicular to the direction of flow at 128 positions down a 2 cm observation tube. This positional information is collected at solutions velocities from 2 to 21 m/s. Variation of the flow velocity allows reaction rate constant to be resolved from the physical mixing process. The reaction of NH 2 OH with I 2, the Dushman reaction, the reaction of NH 2 Cl with I-, and the hydrolysis of iodine were studied with the PAF-PRO. ...|$|R
