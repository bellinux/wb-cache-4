50|$|There are {{numerous}} theories {{as to why}} frog species have declined and disappeared, a possible cause is the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis which {{has been attributed to}} the decline of 14 montane specialist frogs in undisturbed rainforest habitat. Epidemics of the chytrid fungus have also occurred in Eungella National Park in North Queensland around 1985-1986 causing the decline of the Eungella gastric brooding frog Rheobatrachus vitellinus. The fungus is highly pathogenic and rapidly causes the decline and death of the host. In the case of the Eungella gastric brooding frog the population was able to persist and recover however the chytrid fungus still persists in the frog population. The federal government has identified the chytrid fungus as a key threatening process for <b>stream</b> <b>frogs</b> in Australia and has subsequently developed a threat abatement plan for the disease.|$|R
50|$|Its natural {{habitats}} are submontane and montane forest at 750 - 1700 m above sea level. Breeding takes place small, clear, rocky <b>streams.</b> These <b>frogs</b> are often found at night perching 1-2 m high on tree trunks or branches by rocky streams. The tadpoles {{cling to the}} rocks where the current is strong, presumably feeding on lithophytic algae.|$|R
50|$|This key {{distinguishes between}} the {{physical}} differences {{of the leaf}} green tree frog (L. phyllochroa), southern leaf green tree frog (L. nudidigitus) and frogs that represent species described as Pearson's green tree frog (L. pearsoniana) and mountain <b>stream</b> tree <b>frog</b> (L. barringtonensis). All of these are very closely related and look similar. Their taxonomy species is under review.|$|R

50|$|In 1992 an {{experimental}} translocation experiment was being {{conducted to determine}} the cause of population declines in T. acutirostris. Frogs and tadpoles from a stream in the north of the species range were collected and placed into observation enclosures at five sites to the south where the species had disappeared and in a control enclosure at the collection site. During this experiment, the scientist, Michael Mahony (Newcastle University) and Andrew Dennis (James Cook University, observed sick and dying frogs of T. acutirostris and several other <b>stream</b> <b>frogs</b> (Litoria rheocola, Litoria nannotis) in the enclosures and on the stream from where the frogs and tadpoles were being collected. They collected specimens and dispatched them to veterinary pathologists at James Cook University. This was the first observation of the cause of amphibian declines in Australia and directly led to the identification of a fungal pathogen (Batrachochytridium dendrobatididis) as the cause.|$|R
50|$|The {{mountain}} <b>stream</b> tree <b>frog</b> is {{a relatively}} small tree frog growing up to 45 mm in length. It is light green to dark/olive green on the dorsal surface and sometimes brown morphs are encountered. The thighs are a mango-yellow colour and the belly is off-white. A pale brown (almost light yellow) stripe runs from the nostril, across the eye, over the tympanum, {{and down to the}} shoulder, where the line widens and dissipates. Randomly placed black dots are scattered over the dorsal surface. Metamorphs closely resemble the adults, although they are mostly brown in colour. The tadpoles of the L. phyllochroa complex (leaf green tree frog, L. phyllochroa, Pearson's green tree frog, L. pearsoniana, southern leaf green tree frog, L. nudidigitus and the mountain <b>stream</b> tree <b>frog,</b> L. barringtonensis) are very similar in appearance and are very hard to tell apart. Range is best used to distinguish the species.|$|R
50|$|The site of Chalcedon {{is located}} on a small {{peninsula}} on the north coast of the Sea of Marmara, {{near the mouth of}} the Bosphorus. A stream, called the Chalcis or Chalcedon in antiquity and now known as the Kurbağalıdere (Turkish: <b>stream</b> with <b>frogs),</b> flows into Fenerbahçe bay. There Greek colonists from Megara in Attica founded the settlement of Chalcedon in 685 BC, some seventeen years before Byzantium.|$|R
