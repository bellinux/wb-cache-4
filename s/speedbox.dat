However, few limitations, such as low temperatures and relatively long exposure time, limit the phosphine use. In order to improve phosphine application, a special devise, containing a heater and a ventilator, called "Speedbox" has been developed by Detia Degesch GmbH Germany. For studying the effectiveness of phosphine fumigation using <b>Speedbox,</b> we have conducted two kinds of experiments: one in a fumigation room (Pilot) and other in commercial warehouse. For pilot fumigation, adults, pupae and late larvae of Sitophilus oryzae,, Rhyzopertha dominica, Oryzaephilus surinamensis, Trogoderma granarium and Callosobruchus maculatus, and all stages of Tribolium castaneum Herbst, Plodia interpunctella and Ephestia cautella were used as test insects. One to three Degesch Plates (about 2 - 6 g of phosphine gas per m³) were used. Exposure time was 1 to 3 days. The phosphine concentration was monitored by Bedfont device model 415. At 4 g/m³ for 48 h a maximum of phosphine concentration of 1460 ppm was reached. The total mortality of all tested insects and stages was recorded, except the eggs of E. cautella (98 %). The commercial stack fumigation was done at the dosages of 2 - 4 g/m³, exposure time of 2 - 4 days and commodity temperatures of 6 - 17 ºC. At a target concentration of 4 g/m³, 2 hours after beginning of the treatment, the concentration of the gas has reached 414 ppm, with a maximum of 1480 ppm. The total mortality of tested insects at adult, late larvae and pupae stages was recorded. The use of <b>Speedbox</b> allows one-day decrease in the plates degassing time, recirculation of the gas and its event distribution in the treated space and controlling major stored product insects for shorter exposure time at low temperatures...|$|E
