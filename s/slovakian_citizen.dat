40|$|The Eastern part of Austria and {{the regions}} Bratislava and Trnava in Slovakia form an {{economic}} growing region (called Twin-City region). A steadily increase of cross-border traffic {{between these two}} countries is expected. However, no compatible transport demand and mobility data are currently available. In particular, in Slovakia no comprehensive mobility survey has been organised since 30 years, despite a lots of efforts in the past. Up to now, only in Austria mobility data has been collected on a regular basis, but comparable cross border data are missing. In 2013 the Austrian and Slovakian Ministries of Transport decided to organise a cross-border survey conjointly. The aim of this survey was to quantify {{the number of people}} crossing the border at each cross-border station between Austria and Slovakia and to collect information about the purpose of the trip, the modes used as well as the tripâ€™s origin and destination. In total, information about more than 12. 000 trips was collected at ten cross-border stations between Austria and Slovakia. The survey consisted of two parts: (1) manual traffic counts and (2) face-to-face interviews on trains and busses {{as well as on the}} street. Respondents could choose between bi-lingual questionnaires (German or Slovak language), additionally the interviewer offered translation into English, if requested. The collected data were stored in an electronic database accessible from Austria and Slovakia. In order to avoid spelling problems more than 600 municipalities were pre-coded to be selected by the staff entering the data. To achieve a high level of quality, plausibility checks were included in the database. Reference data were used for weighting and grossing up: data of manual traffic counts, data of road site automatic count stations as well as passenger counts provided by the public transport operators were used to calculate average traffic volumes on workdays and Sundays. In total, more than 50. 000 persons cross the border between Austria and Slovakia on an average workday. More than four out of five of these trips are made by car, around one in ten by train and three percent by bus. The proportion of trips made by bicycle or on foot paths is negligible. On Sundays the share of car trips is even higher than on workdays. People crossing the border are mainly <b>Slovakian</b> <b>citizens</b> (more than 2 / 3 of all trips). The majority of trips is undertaken in order to get to or to return from work (about 50...|$|R
