5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive success than non-aposematic males if they can survive long enough to mate.

5|$|Ordinary {{quantum field}} theories, which {{form the basis}} of modern {{elementary}} particle physics, are defined in flat Minkowski space, which is an excellent approximation when it comes to describing the behavior of microscopic particles in weak gravitational fields like those found on Earth. In order to describe situations in which gravity is <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to influence (quantum) matter, yet not <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to require quantization itself, physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime. These theories rely on general relativity to describe a curved background spacetime, and define a generalized quantum field theory to describe the behavior of quantum matter within that spacetime. Using this formalism, it can be shown that black holes emit a blackbody spectrum of particles known as Hawking radiation leading to the possibility that they evaporate over time. As briefly mentioned above, this radiation plays an important role for the thermodynamics of black holes.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} three {{dimensional}} compartmental model {{to investigate the}} impact of media coverage to the spread and control of infectious diseases (such as SARS) in a given region/area. Stability analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is globally-asymptotically stable if a certain threshold quantity, the basic reproduction number (R 0), is less than unity. On the other hand, if R 0 > 1, it is shown that a unique endemic equilibrium appears and a Hopf bifurcation can occur which causes oscillatory phenom-ena. The model may have up to three positive equilibria. Numerical simu-lations suggest that when R 0 > 1 and the media impact is <b>stronger</b> <b>enough,</b> the model exhibits multiple positive equilibria which poses challenge to the prediction {{and control of the}} outbreaks of infectious diseases...|$|R

5|$|With {{the growth}} of {{scholarly}} criticism in the 17th and 18th centuries, fewer historians believed Philip to be a Christian. Historians had become increasingly aware of secular texts, which did not describe Philip as a Christianand which, indeed, recorded him participating as pontifex maximus (chief priest) over the millennial Secular Games in 248. Modern scholars are divided on the issue. Some, like Hans Pohlsander and Ernst Stein, argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are ambiguous, based on oral rumor, and do not vouch for a Christian Philip; others, like John York, Irfan Shahîd, and Warwick Ball, argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are clear and dependable enough that Philip {{can be described as}} a Christian; still others, like Glen Bowersock, argue that the sources are <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to describe Philip as a man interested in and sympathetic to Christianity, but not <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> to call him a Christian.|$|E

The results were purely study projects intended to determine the size of a ship with <b>strong</b> <b>enough</b> armor to counter the rapidly increasing power of bombs deployed by the Allies during the war. The Commission did not discuss its activities with Raeder or his successor, Admiral Karl Dönitz, or with other branches in the OKM. As the designs for the H-42, H-43, and H-44 battleships were purely conjectural, no actual work was begun. The German navy did not seriously consider construction on any of the designs, which were so large that they could not have been built in a traditional slipway. Indeed, the Construction Office of the OKM sought to disassociate itself from the projects, which they found to be of doubtful merit and unnecessary for German victory.|$|E
