The Hero then meets Captain Blade, leader of Somnia's {{military}} {{which gives the}} potential soldier candidates a task to find a special item in a tower. The hero manages to find this item successfully and formally becomes a soldier of Somnia. After a task which the Hero and Carver work together to get a horse for an old man, Carver also becomes a soldier of Somnia and himself and the hero are given permission {{to talk to the}} king where they learn to defeat Murdaw, they need the Mirror of Ra. The Hero and Carver discover another portal similar to the one near Haggleton, which eventually leads them to Port Haven, another town where they can not be seen. Milly, also appearing to have lost her memory, does see them and helps them become visible via Madame Luca's help.|$|E

Lois later awakes from her coma at the hospital, with Jonathan Carroll at her side. Lois manifests psychic powers and helps Superman fight the Psychic Pirate. During the fight, Lois learns that Clark is Superman but falls back into a coma. After defeating the Psychic Pirate, Superman brings Lois back to the hospital.

[...] "Daddy's Little Monster" [...] features Finn and Jake discovering that Hunson Abadeer has turned Marceline into a giant demon. The duo manage to save Marceline.|$|E
500|$|As a final {{tribute to}} Pauline and Wendy Richard, the BBC aired a special {{television}} programme, EastEnders Revealed: Goodbye Pauline, which provided an emotional {{look back at}} Pauline's pivotal storylines during her time in Walford. It also reunited Wendy Richard with prior cast-mates Todd Carty and James Alexandrou (Mark and Martin respectively), and featured character commentary and tributes from television critics and EastEnders actors such as Anna Wing and Pam St. Clement (Lou and Pat). During the programme—which aired on New Year's Day, 2007—Wendy Richard reflected upon how [...] "proud" [...] she was of her character, commenting: [...] "Pauline had everything in life thrown at her and I think she coped with it very well. It showed how people deal with their problems... She wasn't always grumpy... she did have lots of laughs, but sadly people don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that, which is a shame... they still harp on about her wearing her cardigans and Pauline stopped wearing cardigans three years after EastEnders started. She is a good woman, she's a kind woman, a loving woman and all she ever thought about was her family. That {{was the most important}} thing in her life." ...|$|E

500|$|The shipwrecks continued, nonetheless, {{with one}} of the most {{profitable}} of all being the 1931 wreck of the 6,000-ton Danish freighter Pennsylvania on the neighbouring island of Swona. The vessel was plundered by the inhabitants of Stroma, Swona and South Ronaldsay. Much of her cargo of slot machines, spark plugs, clothing, tobacco, watches and car parts was looted and concealed in haystacks, oatfields, lochs and caves. David Stogdon, a lifeboatman, recalled seeing what the islanders did with their illicit salvage: [...] "Every house was stuffed with wreck ... clocks, telescopes, binnacles... I <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> enormous dining-room tables in small cottages. And then of course from time to time they'd have cargo parts of lorries or something like that which could be put together to make a lorry and taken ashore on two or three fishing boats in calm weather. They'd land it quietly somewhere, drive it along and sell it." [...] Customs officers, policemen, coastguards and Receivers of Wreck were not generally welcome – the island had no police force – and the islanders let it be understood that unfortunate things could happen to the boats of unwanted visitors: [...] "Police boats could go missing, develop an unexpected leak or spontaneously combust." [...] The area still presents hazards to passing ships; in January 1993, the Danish coaster Bettina Danica ran aground off the southern end of Stroma. The wreck was broken apart by the action of the sea in 1997 and only her stern section is still visible.|$|E

2500|$|Nonetheless, {{writing in}} the {{afterword}} of Doctor Sleep, King professed continued dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film. He said of it [...] "...of course there was Stanley Kubrick's movie which many <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> — for reasons I have never quite understood — {{as one of the}} scariest films they have ever seen. [...] If you have seen the movie but not read the novel, you should note that Doctor Sleep follows the latter which is, in my opinion, the True History of the Torrance Family." ...|$|E
2500|$|At a party held at Simmons' {{residence}} in Bel Air, Los Angeles {{to celebrate the}} success of The Robe, Burton met Elizabeth Taylor for the first time. Taylor, {{who at the time}} was married to actor Michael Wilding and was pregnant with their first child, recalled her first impression of Burton being [...] "rather full of himself. I <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that he never stopped talking, and I had given him the cold fish eye." [...] Hamlet was a challenge that both terrified and attracted him, as it was a role many of his peers in the British theatre had undertaken, including Gielgud and Olivier. He shared his anxiety with de Havilland whilst coming to terms with her. Bogart too, didn't make it easy for him when he retorted: [...] "I never knew a man who played Hamlet who didn't die broke." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{seemingly}} octogenarian blues player {{played by}} McKinney in blackface. He {{first appeared in}} a sketch in which {{he talked about his}} failed relationship with [...] "Kathy with a K" [...] (McCulloch) from the Secretary sketches and soon grew into a recurring character. [...] His name and style of speech suggest that he may be a parody of the blues guitarist Mississippi Fred McDowell, and an early sketch reveals that Gary is actually a white college graduate who imitates a bluesman due to an affection for the musical style. Gary would always begin a long, blues-related story with the words [...] "Now, I <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> a time..." [...] in a deep Mississippi accent before launching into a harmonica solo or blues song. His songs include [...] "The 'There is a Very Effective Heckler in My Audience' Blues" [...] (in a sketch where Dave Foley, in the audience, points out that Gary actually has very little to complain about as he makes over $10,000 a night) and [...] "Smokin' On the Night Train".|$|E
2500|$|The {{past and}} present are {{constantly}} intertwined in The House in Paris, and the middle section, [...] "The Past," [...] is an imagined history. Characters in the past already have in mind future characters and events. For example, hours after conceiving Leopold, Karen thinks about her son as if he already exists: [...] "the idea of you, Leopold, began to be present with her." [...] This thought of Karen's is, in the end, Leopold's, since he imagines these events; the reader learns Leopold's past while he does, [...] "simultaneously gaining information from disconnected fragments derived {{from a combination of}} hints and opinions filtered through all he experiences in the house in Paris." [...] Bowen herself discussed the [...] "bendability" [...] of time in an essay published in 1951, in which she discusses [...] "factitious memory": [...] "one route to the past (or the idea of the past) is factitious memory. That is to say, by art we are made to <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that which we have not actually known." ...|$|E
