5|$|Originally, the {{athletic}} teams had no official colors and often used gray or maroon and gray for their uniforms. <b>Senior</b> <b>classes</b> would sometimes select colors {{of their own}} choosing. In modern times, the uniforms {{have been based on}} some combination of the four colors of the Maryland flag: red, white, black, and gold. The dominant colors have occasionally changed back and forth with changes of the head coach. In 1904, Maryland adopted a state flag based on the heraldry of Lord Calvert: the Calvert family arms (black and gold) quartered with his mother's Crossland family arms (red and white). From the early 1920s until 1942, the black and gold were adopted as the official school colors.|$|E

25|$|In 1989 the new Catholic co-educational school, Kavanagh College, {{resulting}} from the amalgamation of Moreau College for girls and St Paul's High School (i.e. the Christian Brothers School) for boys, commenced. The <b>senior</b> <b>classes</b> of St Edmund's School (i.e. years 7 and 8) transferred to the new college. The junior classes (Years 5 and 6) were accommodated in Dunedin Catholic primary schools and St Edmund's closed.

25|$|The University of Texas at Austin {{is home to}} the Friar Society. The Friar Society {{was founded}} in 1911 by Curtice Rosser and Marion Levy.

Originally, four men were chosen from the junior and <b>senior</b> <b>classes</b> every year {{on the basis of a}} significant contribution to The University of Texas. The Friar Society recognizes students who have made a significant contribution to The University of Texas. In 1936, the Friars decided to start taking larger classes to accommodate the growing size of the university. Women were first admitted to the Friar Society on March 25, 1973. In 1982, the Friars decided to create a teaching fellowship in honor of the upcoming centennial celebration for The University of Texas. Friar alumni raised $100,000 for this purpose, and this amount was matched by the Board of Regents to create an endowment. The Friar Centennial Teaching Fellowship is an annual award given to a UT professor who has demonstrated excellence at the undergraduate teaching level. With a prize of $25,000, the award is the largest monetary award annually given to a UT professor.|$|E

500|$|The Masons relinquished {{control of}} the school to a shared board of {{trustees}} with the East Alabama Male College in the late 1850s, {{and in the early}} 1860s, the school began admitting boys to the secondary division. When the American Civil War began in 1861, virtually the entire male junior and <b>senior</b> <b>classes</b> of the school, as well as much of the faculty, joined Confederate States of America military units, particularly the 37th Alabama Regiment. [...] As the [...] "principal teacher", W.F. Slaton, was a major in the regiment, classes in Auburn stopped {{for the remainder of the}} war. The regiment was captured at Corinth, Mississippi, and exiled to the Johnson's Island prisoner of war camp on Lake Erie. While imprisoned there, Slaton held the school's classes in the camp. Notably, the African American Union guards, who were prohibited by law from attending school in their native Wisconsin, were invited to join the classes, making Auburn High one of the first Southern schools to integrate, some 90years before Brown v. Board.|$|E
2500|$|The issued {{securities}} {{are often}} split into tranches, or categorized into {{varying degrees of}} subordination. Each tranche has a different level of credit protection or risk exposure: there is generally a senior ("A") class of securities and one or more junior subordinated ("B", [...] "C", etc.) classes that function as protective layers for the [...] "A" [...] class. The <b>senior</b> <b>classes</b> have first claim on the cash that the SPV receives, and the more junior classes only start receiving repayment after the more <b>senior</b> <b>classes</b> have been repaid. Because of the cascading effect between classes, this arrangement {{is often referred to}} as a cash flow waterfall. If the underlying asset pool becomes insufficient to make payments on the securities (e.g. when loans default within a portfolio of loan claims), the loss is absorbed first by the subordinated tranches, and the upper-level tranches remain unaffected until the losses exceed the entire amount of the subordinated tranches. The senior securities might be AAA or AA rated, signifying a lower risk, while the lower-credit quality subordinated classes receive a lower credit rating, signifying a higher risk.|$|E
