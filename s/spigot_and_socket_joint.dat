50|$|<b>Spigot</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> {{involve a}} normal pipe end, the spigot, being {{inserted}} into the socket or bell of another pipe or fitting with a seal being made between the two within the <b>socket.</b> Normal <b>spigot</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joints</b> do not allow direct metal to metal contact with all forces being transmitted through the elastomeric seal. They can consequently flex and allow some degree of rotation, allowing pipes to shift and relieve stresses imposed by soil movement. The corollary is that unrestrained <b>spigot</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joints</b> transmit essentially no compression or tension along the axis of the pipe and little shear. Any bends, tees or valves therefore require either a restrained joint or, more commonly, thrust blocks, which transmit the forces as compression into the surrounding soil.|$|R
50|$|Simpson {{was born}} in Blackwell, Carlisle and began his career in 1778 as a {{millwright}} until being appointed an inspector and engineer of the Chelsea Waterworks. He later also became an engineer at Lambeth Waterworks Company. He contributed {{to the introduction of}} iron fresh water pipes and replacement of wooden mains in London and throughout the United Kingdom, testifying before a Parliamentary select committee in 1821 that he had invented a method of making <b>spigot</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joints</b> watertight by filling them with hemp or flax and then covering them in lead. He also built a workshop to repair and maintain steam engines in 1785, which his son James Simpson took over and developed into James Simpson and Co. Ltd, later Worthington-Simpson Ltd, which after several further mergers currently trades as Flowserve.|$|R

Circumduction {{is a combination of}} flexion, extension, adduction and abduction. Circumduction can be best performed at ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joints,</b> such as the hip and shoulder, but may also be performed by {{other parts of the body}} such as fingers, hands, feet, and head. For example, circumduction occurs when spinning the arm when performing a serve in tennis or bowling a cricket ball.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a Ellipsoid joint is the wrist; it {{functions}} similarly to the ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> except is unable to move 360 degrees.|$|R

5000|$|... {{synovial}} joint (also {{known as a}} diarthrosis) - freely movable.

50|$|Shoulder {{arthritis}} {{can be one}} {{of three}} types of arthritis in the glenohumeral joint of the shoulder. The glenohumeral joint is a ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint,</b> which relies on cartilage to move smoothly and to operate normally.|$|R

50|$|The single bone in {{the thigh}} {{is called the}} femur. This bone is very thick and strong (due to the high {{proportion}} of cortical bone), and forms a ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> at the hip, and a modified hinge joint at the knee.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>spigot</b> <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> {{cast iron}} pipes were jointed by filling the socket {{with a mixture}} of water, sand, iron filings and sal-ammoniac (ammonium chloride.) A gasket ring was pushed into the socket round the spigot to contain the mixture which was pounded into the socket with a caulking tool and then pointed off. This took several weeks to set and produced a completely rigid joint. Such pipe systems are often to be seen in nineteenth century churches in the heating system.|$|R
50|$|The {{steam pipes}} were routed {{across the front}} tube-plates into {{fittings}} which formed a prolongation of the bottom part of the smokeboxes. From there, steam passed through a swivelling and sliding joint to the cylinders. The exhaust pipes back to the smokeboxes were equipped with ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{there are}} {{numerous}} variations, stockless anchors consist {{of a set of}} heavy flukes connected by a pivot or ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> to a shank. Cast into the crown of the anchor is a set of tripping palms, projections that drag on the bottom, forcing the main flukes to dig in.|$|R
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is biocompatible (non-toxic and not {{rejected by}} the body), it has many medical uses, including surgical implements and implants, such as hip balls <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b> (<b>joint</b> replacement) <b>and</b> dental implants that can stay in place for up to 20 years. The titanium is often alloyed with about 4% aluminium or 6% Al and 4% vanadium.|$|R
50|$|Early {{underwater}} lights were fixed electric flood lamps or portable lamps with dry batteries {{for use by}} divers in standard diving dress. Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd developed a model of portable lamp with a parabolic lens and attached to the divers corselet via a ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> allowing the diver to use both hands while working.|$|R
50|$|The {{procedure}} {{exposes the}} head {{section of the}} femur bone (the ball of the ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint),</b> <b>and</b> then the head is removed using a small saw or a bone hammer and chisel. Rarely both sides are done in one operation, most times one side is done and allowed to heal before {{the other side is}} done.|$|R
50|$|The pack has two levers, rigidly {{connected}} to the engine installation. Pressing on these levers, the pilot deflects the nozzles back, and the pack flies forward. Accordingly, raising this lever makes the pack move back. It is possible to lean the engine installation to the sides (because of the ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint)</b> to fly sideways.|$|R
50|$|The {{shoulder}} joint (or glenohumeral joint from Greek glene, eyeball, + -oid, 'form of', + Latin humerus, shoulder) is structurally {{classified as a}} synovial ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> functionally as a diarthrosis and multiaxial joint. It involves articulation between the glenoid cavity of the scapula (shoulder blade) {{and the head of}} the humerus (upper arm bone).|$|R
50|$|Spines are {{ossicles}} {{that project}} {{from the body}} wall and articulate with other ossicles through ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joints</b> mounted on tubercles. They are formed from crystals of calcite and can be solid or hollow, long or short, thick or thin and sharp or blunt. The spines serve a protective function and are also used for locomotion.|$|R
50|$|The intake ports are narrow {{enough to}} ensure that piston rings {{do not need to}} be pegged. Instead of using a gudgeon pin, each piston is {{connected}} to its connecting rod via a ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint,</b> to enable the piston to rotate. This feature has been abandoned for the Gen-2 version in favour of conventional gudgeon pins.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shape of}} {{the ends of the}} bones—Some joints {{normally}} have a large range of movement, such as the shoulder and hip. Both are ball <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joints.</b> If a shallow rather than a deep socket is inherited, a relatively large range of movement will be possible. If the socket is particularly shallow, then the joint may dislocate easily.|$|R
40|$|Building {{automobile}} {{bodies from}} lightweight materials using space-frame construction techniques is increasingly popular because of exhaust emission legislation. One proposed method of achieving {{this is by}} using plug <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joints,</b> which are injected with adhesive after assembly. A method for controlling this process, irrespective of component tolerances, is proposed here. A test rig representing a plug <b>and</b> <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> was injected with the adhesive and a method for successfully filling the butt-jointed end of the joint found. The addition of a restriction to the joint's open end gave a method of filling the cavity without creating any air gaps. The use of neoprene O-ring seals for creating the restriction was investigated. The pressure of the adhesive at the joint inlet (gate) was recorded (data logger), and an analysis {{of this has been}} used to determine the point when adhesive injection can be arrested and the joint correctly filled...|$|R
