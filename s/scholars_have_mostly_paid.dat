Popular initiatives and more intense campaigns also generate a higher share of negative campaigning. Overall, then, a number of causal factors identified in (U.

While analyzing Boris Pasternaks translations of eight plays by Shakespeare, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Antony and Cleopatra, Othello, two parts of Henry IV, King Lear, and Macbeth, critics <b>have</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>paid</b> attention to the fidelity of the translations to the originals and have not scrutinized the relationship between the style of Pasternaks translations and of his original poetry and prose. Such critics of Pasternaks renditions of Shakespeare, especially of Hamlet, as L. Borovoi, V. Levik, and Iu. Levin, have found that the language of his translations is similar to that of his own poetry, while others, Anna Akhmatova in particular, that it is not. Anna Kay France and Henry Gifford, among others, believe that Pasternaks translations are closer to his style after 1940, which is more traditional and simple than the style of his previous writings. Undoubtedly, Pasternaks translations have features marking them apart from other Russian renderings of Shakespeare. Among the peculiarities of their lexicon are appositional compounds, substantive adjectives, folkloric elements, allusions to contemporary events, and a great number of idiomatic expressions and other colloquialisms. The frequent ellipses in Pasternaks translations, though not necessarily in the spirit of Shakespeare, sometimes lead to distortions or ambiguity...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} years, {{political}} science <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> increasingly questioned {{the role of}} democracy in producing human welfare and public goods provision, as many democracies tend to fail in these aspects. In attempts {{to track down the}} causes behind these failures, <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> lifted the issue of bad governance as a central factor. When investigating how to improve human well being, the political science research community <b>have</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>paid</b> attention to what can been referred to as the input side of the political system – namely access to power, while the output side of the system – exercise of power, to a large extent has been overlooked. As a consequence, {{it has been argued that}} if focus is shifted from representative democracy to measures of Quality of Government (QoG) or state capacity the picture of what politics can do for human well being will change dramatically. Similar arguments are present also within food security literature, where scholars are increasingly questioning democracy as a determinant of food security and instead turning their attention to strong institutions and the role of governments. The objective of this study is to empirically contribute to the yet mainly theoretical debate on the role of democracy and Quality of Government in human welfare with a food security focus. This is done by examining the role of democracy and QoG, measured as perception of corruption, on access to food. In addition, corruption is challenged as a determinant of food security by more traditional explanation within previous literature. The results of the study indicate that democracy does not have an effect on access to food, but corruption does. The only competing explanation that proved to play a significant role in access to food was poverty, while factors such as GDP, population and trade did not. Hence, the results of this study suggest that food security is indeed a governance issue – and more specifically a governance output issue...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} commit the vast {{majority}} of crimes, corporations must, in some sense, have mental states. Lawmakers and scholars assume that factfinders need fundamentally different procedures for attributing mental states to corporations and individuals. As a result, they saddle themselves with unjustifiable theories of mental state attribution, like respondeat superior, that produce results wholly at odds with all the major theories of the objectives of criminal law. This Article draws on recent findings in cognitive science to develop a new, comprehensive approach to corporate mens rea that would better allow corporate criminal law to fulfill its deterrent, retributive, and expressive aims. It does this by letting factfinders attribute mental states to corporations at trial as they ordinarily do to similar groups out of the courtroom. Under this new approach, factfinders would be asked to treat corporate defendants much like natural person defendants. Rather than atomize corporations into individual employees, factfinders would view them holistically. Then, factfinders could do just what they do for natural people—in light of surrounding circumstances and other corporate acts, infer what mental state most likely accompanied the act at issue. Such a theory harmonizes with recent cognitive scientific findings on mental state and responsibility attribution, developments that corporate liability <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> <b>mostly</b> ignored...|$|R
40|$|Impact and {{evaluation}} {{of research in the}} humanities {{has been the subject of}} several recent publications (e. g. Benneworth et al. 2016, Ochsner et al. 2016, Severinson 2017). A common theme is the need for a re-evaluation of how the humanities are evaluated, as well as for research on the effects of evaluation practices on the humanities (Ochsner et al. 2016, p. 9). Another important idea is that this re-evaluation should consider the nature of the public value of the humanities (Benneworth et al. 2016, especially ch. 7). The dominant model of research evaluation has as its focus societal economic benefits of research, a focus humanities <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> <b>mostly</b> been uncomfortable with (Benneworth et al., ch. 2). One of the main tools of research evaluation, bibliometric analysis, is problematic – to say the least – for the humanities (Ochsner et al. 2016). As the policy and practice of research evaluations influences the way research is conducted (van Leeuwen 2016, Severinson 2017) there is a potential danger that the inherent value of the humanities will be eroded and their value to society diminished through evaluation.

Participant-observation in subsistence activities like fishing and gathering supplemented the interview material. The key local institutions involve resource harvesting, resource processing, and resource sharing. The analysis of interview and observation data show that local institutions help households and communities cope with fluctuations in harvest amounts due to ecological perturbations, formal management regulations, and high fuel prices. Although local institutions can be fragile in the face of market pressures, and rationale for some institutions are not known by the younger generation, the strong role of sharing suggests that Yup’ik local institutions are expected to persist as climatic, environmental, economic, and social change continues...|$|R

40|$|Carlos Fuentes {{is one of}} {{the best}} known writers of the Boom of Latin American Literature in the 1960 s. <b>Scholars</b> <b>have</b> <b>mostly</b> focused on Fuentes'search for Mexican {{identity}} in his works. The other aspects of his works, however, such as his uses of points of view, his international experience, and especially the 'relativity'in his use of parody and in his descriptions of otherness, families and politics, have not sufficiently be focused on. This paper aims to show how the "relativity" functions in "Vlad," a fantastic story by Fuentes which was published in 2004 along with five others in Inquieta compañía. I also aim to examine the recent interest of Fuentes by focusing on European Dracula and other texts and movies, which are referred to in "Vlad. " Dracula, the famous novel by Bram Stoker, has been read as an expression of oppositions between countries and between communities, or of xenophobia. By reading "Vlad" we find that Dracula also contains an aspect of cultural amalgamation, which appears in the descriptions of vampire bats that in reality inhabit only Middle and South America. "Vlad" draws attention to that cultural mixture in Dracula. And a close reading of the story makes it clear that vampires once were gods in Mexican indigenous culture. The metamorphosis from European Dracula to Mexican Dracula shows Fuentes's text's "relativity. " It is possible to read "Vlad" as a parody, because the story contains many details from previous texts and movies about vampires. The European vampire becomes a god in Mexico, and this can be seen by examining characters'names in "Vlad. " Even though it is one of Fuentes's fantastic stories, "Vlad" indicates his recent interest in relativity, which can only be expressed in the relation of otherness. 論...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{countries}} participating in large-scale international assessments has grown dramatically {{during the past two}} decades and the use of assessment results in national-level education policy debate has increased commensurately. Recent literature on the role of international assessments in education politics suggests that rankings and performance indicators can shape national educational discourse in important ways. This dissertation examines the use of one such assessment, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), in education discourse in the United States from 2000 to 2012. The United States played a key role in the development of PISA and has participated in almost every international assessment of the past fifty years. Yet <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> <b>mostly</b> overlooked the reception of international assessment in the United States. This dissertation seeks to address this gap. Using an original dataset of one hundred and thirty texts from American academic literature, think tanks and the media, I examine the use of references to PISA and to top scoring countries on PISA, e. g., Finland and China (Shanghai), during the first decade of PISA testing. I find that PISA has rapidly become an accepted comparative measure of educational excellence throughout US discourse. However, despite consistently middling American scores, attempts to turn America’s PISA performance into a crisis of the US education system have not stuck. Instead, I suggest that both global and domestic politics play a stronger role in shaping the interpretations of student achievement on PISA than does student performance. I show how the American PISA discourse: (1) is driven by political, not empirical, realities; (2) contains few calls for policy borrowing from top-scoring countries and has not engendered any direct efforts at policy reform; (3) is framed with remarkable consistency across the political spectrum; and (4) is a profoundly elite enterprise, privileging the voices of international organizations and policy makers over those of parents, teachers and students...|$|R

The bulk of the contributions to this recent trend, however, have focused on Kant’s remarks on organic life in the Critique of Judgment, such that Kant’s “theory of biology” is now seen to be firmly located in that text. Amidst such consolidation, there are a few pieces that have begun to address Kant’s appeal to organic vocabulary within the context of his theory of cognition, though these too remain dominated by the interpretive template set by the third Critique. My own strategy in this essay will be different. Kant did indeed borrow from the life sciences for his model of the mind, but in a manner that would reject a naturalized account. His preference for epigenesis as a theory of organic generation needs to be carefully distinguished, therefore, from the use he would make of it when discussing a metaphysical portrait of reason...|$|R

So far scientific attention <b>has</b> <b>mostly</b> been <b>paid</b> to the evaluation of their acute ecotoxicological effects with data on long-term effects for non-target organisms still largely missing. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to evaluate the potential toxicities of five sulphonamides to duckweed (Lemna minor) after prolonged exposure time (14 days). To elucidate whether their phytotoxic effects result from potential photodegradation products, the toxicity of standard solutions of selected sulphonamides was also investigated in a standard 7 -day test but after irradiation (by keeping them under the test conditions) for the selected time (after 7 and 14 days). The ecotoxicological tests were accompanied by chemical analyses to be able to link the observed effects to the concentrations and nature of the exposed compounds. The results showed a shift in the toxicity of SAs: a strong decrease in toxicity for the two most toxic sulphonamides (sulphamethoxazole and sulphadimethoxine) and a slight increase in toxicity for three other SAs (sulphadimidine, sulphathiazole, sulphamerazine) in the prolonged test. However, a decrease in the toxicity and concentration of all the SAs was observed when stock solutions were irradiated prior to the toxicity experiment, which suggests that the observed effects towards L. minor of five SAs in the prolonged test cannot be directly associated with the degradation of these compounds under the test conditions but with their different mode of toxic action towards these organisms...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to the recent academic study of WhatsApp, the instant messaging (IM) tool that enables people to communicate in a multimodal way mainly via their smartphones and which has impressively become a core form of communication in many social communities (Church & Oliveira, 2013; Sultan, 2014). This study presents research on the most salient discursive realisations and pragmatic uses in WhatsApp statuses, this is, the communicative output of a 139 -character blank where WhatsApp users are prompted to write any message in order to complete their profile information. Research on both the discourse of Computer-Mediated-Communication (CMC) and communicative practices associated to it is vast (Barton & Lee, 2013; Crystal, 2006). Perhaps due to its more established status as communication media, studies in this field <b>have</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>paid</b> attention to the discourse of text messages (Thurlow & Brown, 2003), commonly referred to as textese. More specifically, possibly driven by the apocalyptic and somewhat mediatised visions attributed to the language used in these online communication tools (Thurlow, 2006), academic research has largely aimed to prove the not-so-negative effects of textese in communicative practices and contexts (Tagliamonte & Denis, 2008; Plester et al., 2009; Drouin, 2011). Nonetheless, due to its crucial role in plenty of social communities, research has gradually shed light on the discourse used in IM tools (Baron, 2005; Lee, 2007). The great and rather recent impact of WhatsApp as a form of communication is triggering academic research on the discourse that characterises this IM system. In spite of being remarkably under-researched from a discursive perspective, existing studies explore some language features of WhatsApp (Calero-Vaquera, 2014), making great emphasis on its multimodal character. Far less attention has been devoted however to the discourse of the 139 -character blank provided by WhatsApp to allow users update their statuses, even though similar types of communicative outcome has widely been investigated in other systems of online communication, namely Facebook (Garcia & Sikström, 2014; Eisenlauer, 2014). As far as methodology is concerned, the objectives of this study are to examine recurrent discursive realisations and how these are realised from a discursive perspective, to identify the most frequent pragmatic uses and to put forward the possible reasons behind this choice. Thus, this paper analyses a corpus of 400 WhatsApp statuses randomly selected from the total sample of 523 contacts. Once the final corpus was computerised, a set of tags was designed in order to quantify the most frequent instances. As regards the analytical framework, partly driven by the character of the analysed status, this research relies on contributions in which multimodality is at core of their theoretical underpinnings (Kress & van Leeuwen, 2001; Machin, 2013). Findings outline the most common discursive realisations and pragmatic uses in a corpus of 400 WhatsApp statuses. Apart from elucidating already existing research on the discourse of WhatsApp, they also demonstrate the centrality of multimodal discourse in this sort of communication (Vincent, 2012) and pave the way for further research within this field of study...|$|R

The {{story of}} the Gerasene demoniac in Mark 5 : 1 - 20 {{is one of the}} great stories of the bible. Yet the full {{implications}} of this story remain largely unexplored. <b>Scholars</b> <b>have</b> focused <b>mostly</b> on it as a single pericope with interesting historical features. Its function within the whole of the Markan redaction has, surprisingly, been neglected. This thesis seeks to redress this neglect by showing how the {{story of the}} exorcism of the Gerasene demoniac acts as a hermeneutical key which helps us access the fuller dimensions of Mark's narrative.

40|$|Recovering the Iberian Peninsula {{from the}} Moorish {{occupation}} of seven hundred years (711 - 1492), Spaniards attempted to project new self-images of Spain with nationalistic zeal. From the late 15 th {{century to the}} 16 th century, the Spanish patriotic passion was further heightened by the Renaissance and the Discovery of America. A variety of ways to celebrate the political and cultural dominance of Spain were explored; nevertheless, no other than the concept of honor neatly encapsulated the national obsession of Spanish Gold Age literature. Among all {{the authors of this}} period, Miguel de Cervantes epitomized this prominent fascination of Spanish literature. As Antonio Maravall pointed out, Spanish Baroque authors, poets, and playwrights were preoccupied with repression, power, and authority during the transition from the plenitude of the Renaissance to the instability of the Baroque period. The 17 th century literature embodies ideological, social and artistic discourses that underscore social conditions of crisis and conflicts, in which each human being desperately searches for liberating forces of the individual existence. Miguel de Cervantes uniquely condenses those sociopolitical predicaments into the theme of jealousy in his writings. This historical context is also one that has been witness to the rise of the novelistic genre, with Don Quijote being considered the first modern novel. Cervantine <b>scholars</b> <b>have</b> <b>mostly</b> focused on novelistic concepts in the study of Don Quijote, and I argue in this presentation that those elements are inscribed in many of Cervantes 2 ̆ 7 s other works, thanks to his capacity to integrate and describe characters 2 ̆ 7 senses and their psychological effects. In his works, the concept of jealousy is always present, and I propose that the roots of the novel as a genre were supported by his use of this particular sensory emotion, which is novelistic in nature. Indeed, in Cervantes, jealousy brings together novelistic components: it can trigger humor, as fictional cuckoldry can be a source of laughter in some texts; it also revolves around dialogue, as jealousy plots always involve at least three perspectives; and it is open-ended, as it allows revisiting traditional plots in innovative ways. ^ By viewing emotion and cognition as a path toward human subjectivity, this presentation opens up multidisciplinary and holistic perspectives to interpret jealously in Cervantes. Within both a historical and cognitive framework, we can shed light on the importance of this emotion not only in the field of Early Modern literature but also in the new interdisciplinary field of cognitive science and literary studies. In the spirit of a call for consilience among the sciences and the humanities, my theoretical approach is grounded in affective and cognitive science, a field of research that aims to explain the mechanisms underlying intelligent behavior by modeling psychological systems that considers the mind and body as a single entity. In light of this cognitive conception of senses, jealousy can be recognized not only as a literary emotion, but also as a mean to explore its effect as both narrative and psychological mechanism in a historical context that generated the birth of the novel, therefore modifying readers 2 ̆ 7 minds and thoughts as they faced new ways of experiencing characters 2 ̆ 7 personal and emotional lives. ...|$|R
