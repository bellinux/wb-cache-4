5|$|For its 1908–09 {{season the}} Metropolitan {{management}} {{brought in the}} Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini to share duties with Mahler, who made only 19appearances in the entire season. One of these was a much-praised performance of Smetana's The Bartered Bride on 19 February 1909. In {{the early part of}} the season Mahler conducted three concerts with the New York Symphony Orchestra. This renewed experience of orchestral conducting inspired him to resign his position with the opera house and accept the conductorship of the re-formed New York Philharmonic. He continued to make occasional guest appearances at the Met, his last performance being Tchaikovsky's The Queen of <b>Spades</b> on 5 March 1910.|$|E

5|$|Tchaikovsky wrote many {{works that}} are {{popular with the}} {{classical}} music public, including his Romeo and Juliet, the 1812 Overture, his three ballets (The Nutcracker, Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty) and Marche Slave.

The player can play a card in any of their columns as long as the subsequent total is 21 or less; if the card cannot be played in any column, it must be discarded.

5|$|Often {{armed with}} no more than shovels and <b>spades,</b> {{soldiers}} and civilians dug for bodies in the rubble. Other than this, rescue workers were faced with a number of obstacles, including the temperatures of the villages damaged. They were warm during the day, although the villages grew colder at night, making rescue work harder and threatening the health of the homeless and anyone alive and trapped under the debris. Many civilians were discouraged from helping due to fear of aftershocks. According to Gary Oshea of International Rescue, the volunteers did not have enough technical equipment, and the religious leaders seemed unwilling to contribute much. Official rescue work ended on June 24, 2002, when rescue workers said there were no more survivors.|$|E

The style of Jack <b>Spade</b> reflects {{different aspects than}} the Kate <b>Spade</b> New York Company does, {{and not only because}} it is a male line. While Kate <b>Spade</b> is a clean cut line that represents a sleek, upper east side, preppy style, Jack <b>Spade</b> is more of a rugged style. The styles are completely different because they are based on what trends that specific gender is wearing in the upper east side. Jack <b>Spade</b> is composed more of darker colors rather than bright lively colors(Winters 36). Its founder and principal designer was Andy <b>Spade.</b> In recent years, Kate <b>Spade</b> has been featuring designs and special editions by guest designers and is no longer the sole artistic vision of the husband and wife team.All the Jack <b>Spade</b> stores were permanently closed in January 2015, but the brand continued to sell online and at Nordstrom.|$|R

5|$|The {{momentum}} {{behind the}} NWOBHM also benefited already established bands, which reclaimed the spotlight with new and acclaimed releases.

His former Deep Purple bandmate Ritchie Blackmore also climbed the UK charts with his hard rock group Rainbow's releases Down to Earth (1979) and Difficult to Cure (1981). Black Sabbath recovered and returned to success with the albums Heaven and Hell (1980) and Mob Rules (1981), featuring the ex-Rainbow singer Ronnie James Dio. 1980 saw several other entries by hard rock and heavy metal bands in the top 10 of the British charts: MSG's first album peaked at No.8, Whitesnake's Ready an' Willing at No.6, Judas Priest's best-seller British Steel and Motörhead's Ace of <b>Spades</b> at No.4, while Back in Black by AC/DC reached number one.|$|E

5|$|Of Tchaikovsky's Western contemporaries, Robert Schumann {{stands out}} as an {{influence}} in formal structure, harmonic practices and piano writing, according to Brown and musicologist Roland John Wiley. As mentioned earlier, Asafyev comments that Schumann left his mark on Tchaikovsky {{not just as a}} formal influence but also as an example of musical dramaturgy and self-expression. Leon Botstein claims the music of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner also left their imprints on Tchaikovsky's orchestral style. The late-Romantic trend for writing orchestral suites, begun by Franz Lachner, Jules Massenet, and Joachim Raff after the rediscovery of Bach's works in that genre, may have influenced Tchaikovsky to try his own hand at them. His teacher Anton Rubinstein's opera The Demon became a model for the final tableau of Eugene Onegin. So did Léo Delibes' ballets Coppélia and Sylvia for The Sleeping Beauty and Georges Bizet's opera Carmen (a work Tchaikovsky admired tremendously) for The Queen of <b>Spades.</b> Otherwise, it was to composers of the past that Tchaikovsky turned—Beethoven, whose music he respected; Mozart, whose music he loved; Glinka, whose opera A Life for the Tsar made an indelible impression on him as a child and whose scoring he studied assiduously; and Adolphe Adam, whose ballet Giselle was a favorite of his from his student days and whose score he consulted while working on The Sleeping Beauty. Beethoven's string quartets may have influenced Tchaikovsky's attempts in that medium. Other composers whose work interested Tchaikovsky included Hector Berlioz, Felix Mendelssohn, Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Henry Litolff.|$|E

25|$|Although for {{discussion}} purposes the Zhou coins are divided up into categories of knives, <b>spades,</b> and round coins, {{it is apparent}} from archaeological finds {{that most of the}} various kinds circulated together.
