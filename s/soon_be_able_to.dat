500|$|The British fire ceased after {{less than}} twenty minutes, which limited the damage inflicted. Admiral Esteva, Admiral Sud (C. in C.

Since Dunkerque was beached just in front of a village, Admiral Sommerville, preferred to attack with torpedo bombers to avoid [...] causing serious collateral damages to civilians. The second attack took place on July 6. One of the torpedoes hit the small patrol ship Terre-Neuve, which carried a load of depth charges, and was moored alongside Dunkerque. The explosion of fourteen depth charges, equivalent of 1,400kg of TNT, ripped an enormous hole in the battleship's hull and killed a further 40 seamen. Dunkerque sank in shallow water. Another torpedo struck the ship and tore a hole in two compartments. The ship probably escaped a total loss by flooding the 330mm gun magazines which had been ordered as soon as the torpedo-bombers appeared. The total number killed on Dunkerque during the two attacks of July 3 and July 6 reached 210.|$|E

2500|$|By {{strengthening}} the continuity assumption slightly {{one can easily}} show that the Fourier series converges everywhere.

This was proved by Dirichlet, who expressed his belief that he would <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> extend his result to cover all continuous functions. [...] Another way to obtain convergence everywhere {{is to change the}} summation method.

2500|$|The Porte {{probably}} {{believed it}} had bought off Russian {{support for the}} Greeks, neutralising the Anglo-Russian protocol of April. But Tsar Nicholas {{had no intention of}} forgetting Greece. Negotiations proceeded on a formal treaty based on the protocol, now with France included. (Metternich refused an invitation to participate, and continued to support the Porte). But progress stalled, largely because of continuing opposition within the British Cabinet to intervention, led by the Duke of Wellington. The Tsar became impatient, and stepped up pressure on Great Britain by despatching in October 1826 a naval squadron to the Mediterranean from St Petersburg, sending them off by expressing confidence that they would <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> despatch the Ottoman fleet à la Russe. The squadron pointedly visited the British naval base of Portsmouth en route. This implied threat of unilateral action by Russia strengthened Canning's hand in the Cabinet: [...] when, in April 1827, Liverpool was obliged by illness to step down as prime minister, Canning won the contest to succeed him.

2500|$|Roberto Mignani at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Milan who led {{the team}} of astronomers has commented that [...] "“When Einstein {{came up with the}} theory of general {{relativity}} 100 years ago, he had no idea that it would be used for navigational systems. The consequences of this discovery probably will also have to be realised on a longer timescale.” The team found that visible light from the star had undergone linear polarisation of around 16%. If the birefringence had been caused by light passing through interstellar gas or plasma, the effect should have been no more than 1%. Definitive proof would require repeating the observation at other wavelengths and on other neutron stars. At X-ray wavelengths the polarization from the quantum fluctuations should be near 100%. Although no telescope currently exists that can make such measurements, there are several proposed X-ray telescopes that may <b>soon</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> verify the result conclusively such as ESO's European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), China's Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) and NASA's Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE).|$|E

[...] In response, Emperor Xuanzong considered passing the throne to Li Heng and personally lead the troops against An—a proposal that Yang feared, believing that Li Heng would then take actions against the Yangs.

[...] Yang, after this incident, began to be apprehensive of Geshu as well.

[...] Yang therefore sent his associate Du Qianhui (杜乾輝) with a separate army command to the front as well to watch Geshu, and Geshu, in turn apprehensive that Yang was going to act against him, found an excuse to execute Du, further causing Yang's suspicions. [...] Yang therefore had Emperor Xuanzong order Geshu to engage An's forward commander Cui Qianyou (崔乾祐), despite Geshu's repeated protestations that a battle was inadvisable.
