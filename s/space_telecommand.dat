The most important result is that under imperfect carrier reference the command subcarrier and the ranging tone frequencies can be selected to suppress the cross-modulation interference and interference from the ranging channel for the specified command bit rate and ranging code component. Recommendations as to use of specific command subcarrier frequency, command bit rate, and ranging tone frequency are made for consideration in future standards systems...|$|E
30|$|TC links are {{currently}} evolving to include {{new and more}} challenging mission profiles, characterized by much more demanding requirements. Compliance with these new requirements imposes the use of more advanced coding techniques than the BCH(63, 56) code. In <b>space</b> <b>telecommanding,</b> it is always of fundamental importance to ensure the integrity of very short emergency commands, with a very low data rate and limited latency. Such constraints impose the adoption of short codes.|$|R
30|$|Reliable <b>space</b> <b>telecommanding</b> is of {{fundamental}} importance as {{the success of}} a mission may be compromised because of an error corrupting a TC message. This imposes strict constraints on the maximum tolerable error rates. In particular, the codeword error rate (CER) is defined as the ratio of the number of decoding failures to the total number of received codewords. Requirements are often specified in terms of average CER, and a typical value is CER ≤ 10 − 5.|$|R

30|$|The {{performance}} of short low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes {{that will be}} included in the standard for next-generation <b>space</b> <b>telecommanding</b> is analyzed. The paper is focused on the use of a famous ordered statistics decoder known as most reliable basis (MRB) algorithm. Despite its complexity may appear prohibitive in space applications, this algorithm is shown to actually represent a realistic option for short LDPC codes, enabling significant gains over more conventional iterative algorithms. This is possible by a hybrid approach which combines the MRB decoder with an iterative decoding procedure in a sequential manner. The effect of quantization is also addressed, by considering two different quantization laws and comparing their performance. Finally, the impact of limited memory availability onboard of spacecrafts is analyzed and some solutions are proposed for efficient processing, towards a practical onboard decoder implementation.|$|R

Taking as a reference the solutions recently emerged as the most promising ones, based on Low- Density Parity-Check codes, we explore the behavior of alternative schemes, based on parallel concatenated turbo codes and soft-decision decoded BCH codes.

Besides some more consolidated proposals, using low-density parity-check codes, we characterize and assess the performance of alternative schemes, based on parallel turbo codes and soft-decision decoded BCH codes. The analysis considers relevant metrics AQ 2 like the codeword error rate, the frame error rate, and the undetected frame error rate. The considered codes include binary and non-binary low-density parity-check codes, parallel turbo codes and extended BCH codes, with different decoding algorithms.

In this paper, we face the problem of carrier phase synchronization for these modulation and coding schemes. I...|$|R

The currently defined and implemented SLE recommendations are oriented around a traditional CCSDS telecommand and telemetry protocol set, which uses discrete telecommand frames that are encapsulated in Communication Link Transmission Units (CLTUs) for transport over the ground segment, and telemetry data encapsulated in Transfer Frames at the spacecraft. This paper discusses several non-traditional uses of the SLE services. The applications addressed within lie outside the discrete packet telecommand/telemetry subset of the SLE recommendations that are fully defined by CCSDS. This paper will focus {{on the use of the}} currently implemented SLE model to enable the transport of other forms of data, which may be subject to various transmission constraints, across the ground segment...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} been {{conducted}} {{within the framework of}} the STAR project involving Intecs (Pisa) and Sitael (Pisa) companies. The project aims at the realization of the up-link section of a telemetry and <b>telecommand</b> <b>space</b> transponder for Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite missions. Based on the Software Defined Radio paradigm, the work will focus on the development and realization of a flexible receiver chain that allows the reception of data at different modulation types and data-rates with the possibility of re-configuration on the fly. An high-level MATLAB model has been developed to validate the system performance (BER) including the effect of the quantization on the system. After that the VHDL description of the receiver chain has been developed and subsequently implemented on Xilinx-Virtex Space-Grade FPGAs...|$|R

The SLE recommendations define protocols for extending the space link from ground terminals to other facilities deeper within a ground network, allowing distributed access to <b>space</b> link <b>telecommand</b> and telemetry services. The SLE protocols are widely used to provide cross support between sites, programs, and agencies. Traditional SLE protocol implementations have been limited in their ability to support high data rates and large numbers of concurrent service instances. Such limited solutions were sufficient to support the needs of spacecraft health and status or older, low-rate science data. More recent missions, however, have required significantly increased data rates on both uplink and downlink paths, necessitating a new approach to SLE implementation. This paper discusses the design principles involved in implementing the SLE protocols in support of high channel and aggregate mission data rates, with particular focus on the tradeoffs necessary to provide SLE link capability at sustained single-channel rates above 1 Gigabit per second. The paper addresses significant performance bottlenecks in the conventional SLE protocol stack and proposes potential mitigation strategies for them...|$|R

The SLE recommendations define protocols for extending the space link from ground terminals to other facilities deeper within a ground network, allowing distributed access to <b>space</b> link <b>telecommand</b> and telemetry services. The SLE protocols are widely used to provide cross support between sites, programs, and agencies. In traditional SLE deployments, individual service instances have been manually provisioned well in advance of the commencement of cross support for a particular mission, and hardware and software resources have been allocated to those service instances at the time of provisioning. While valid, this approach requires that dedicated resources be provided for each mission and service instance, and limits an SLE provider's ability to reallocate resources in real time based on system availability or other factors. This paper discusses an alternative approach to SLE service provisioning, in which individual service instances are assigned resources from a common resource pool at the time that each service instance is initialized. The paper addresses the key design elements and technical tradeoffs involved in this approach, and discusses the potential benefits with regard to load balancing, equipment reuse, and resiliency against system failure...|$|R
