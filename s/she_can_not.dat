25|$|The {{effects of}} such high incarceration rates are also shown in other ways. For example, {{a woman who has}} been {{recently}} released from prison is ineligible for welfare in most states. She is not eligible for subsidized housing, and for Section 8 she has to wait two years before she can apply. In addition to finding housing, she also has to find employment, but most likely <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> find a job because she has a criminal record so no one wants to hire her. Essentially, a woman who has been recently released from prison comes into a society that is not prepared structurally or emotionally to welcome her back.|$|E

After her defeat, Kirakisho uses her illusions to create a middle school student named [...] to replace Rozen and to craft imitated Rozen Maidens to be her sister.

500|$|Ben H. Grimm's {{review in}} The Moving Picture World was {{completely}} negative and {{described it as}} [...] "one of the most insidious, moral-destroying pictures ever produced. It will lower {{to the level of}} a bawdy house any theater in which it is shown. It reeks of a filthy sex element that struts across the screen in the sheep's clothing of alleged propaganda advocating the segregation of vice." [...] Grimm highlights how the film's prostitute sells herself and finds not ill, but instead gets worldly gains. Grimm also notes that the production is based on the premise that a prostitute is a prostitute by choice, does not want reform and infers that <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be reformed. Grimm's review stated that the great production was even more detrimental with a metaphor that stated a well-dressed criminal was less likely to be suspected than a poorly dressed criminal.|$|E

Calvin discovered that Mercedes was behind the threats, and the pair go on to have a [...] "day of passion"; Metcalfe explained that their relationship is [...] "all about the sex". Mercedes tried everything to convince Calvin not {{to go through with}} the wedding. As Metcalfe stated, [...] "They talk, shout and cry and she tells him she loves him".

500|$|The video premiered on MTV and BET in September 1997 and {{was shot}} in [...] Puerto Rico on July 26, 1997. The video begins with Carey, playing as [...] "Agent M," [...] being held hostage in a large mansion. The captors are played by Eddie Griffin, Frank Sivero, and Johnny Brennan of The Jerky Boys, who {{continue}} to taunt Carey over her capture and eventual death. [...] "Agent M" [...] speaks in Spanish to the captors, saying <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> understand them. After a series of dialogue, Carey escapes her Griffin's character and dives into a swimming pool from the mansion's roof. After an ensemble change, Carey dons a swimsuit and escapes the island via a watercraft. The video's antagonists continue their pursuit of Carey throughout {{a large body of}} water, until she arrives aboard a large ship. It is unclear if both scenes are happening separately or side by side. Throughout most of the video, Carey is seen posing on a large sailboat, while wearing a white bikini. After boarding the ship, Carey begins dancing and is soon joined by a group of male sailors. After a sequence of dance light dance routines, Carey is seen on an island with her lover, male model David Fumero, and her real life dog, Jack. They frolic together on the island, while Carey happily enjoys her romance.|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Silber from Space.com {{was very}} {{negative}} towards the episode, saying, [...] "This episode conveys {{a strong sense}} of a writer, director and actors merely going through the motions, collecting their sizable paychecks while running out the clock on the season and series. The plot is not compelling, the agents themselves seem not to take it seriously, and the doppelgangers around whom the action revolves are little more than ciphers." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two wrote, [...] "'Fight Club' is a marker for a series that seems to want to die now, please. [...] it's tonally one of the most atypical episodes the series ever made, conceived in spite and self-loathing and sheer exhaustion." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris criticized the use of Kathy Griffin and asserted, [...] "the guest cast {{is one of the worst}} ever. [...] Griffin [...] simply is not up to the task; <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> differentiate Betty and Lulu at all [...] and she reads every line as if she were still on her cancelled sitcom." [...] i09 reviewer Cyriaque Lama named [...] "The Kathy Griffin Twins" [...] the tenth [...] "Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters of the Week", and derided her performance as the Templeton twins. In 2016, in a ranking of all episodes of the series from best to worst, Vulture.com named [...] "Fight Club" [...] the worst episode of the series.|$|E

500|$|Ayane {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a top-tier character {{in many of the}} games she is playable in, especially in the DOA fighting games where she was noted for being very unpredictable and confusing for the opponent as well as fast and hard to counter. Previewing the original Dead or Alive for the PlayStation, Computer & Video Games opined she [...] "has an unusual floaty kind of fighting style, but has some great moves. Her quick punches make stringing combos together easy, and her throws are great for hitting people into the Danger Zone" [...] (an interactive feature within some arenas). In Prima Games' official guide for Dead or Alive Ultimate (a remake version of Dead or Alive and Dead or Alive 2), Eric Mylonas declared Ayane the [...] "tougher of the two siblings" [...] as she [...] "brings strings of blindingly fast combos into play and has devastating holds and throws." [...] Mylonas wrote Ayane has a major weakness in that <b>she</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> stop moving without becoming [...] "an easy prey," [...] and she may not be favored by those who prefer [...] "huge, over-the-top moves," [...] but for a [...] "more patient sort, there's probably no better character in the game." [...] According to GameSpy's guide to Ultimate by Andrew Alfonso, Ayane's key moves include her high kickâwhich is [...] "a lot" [...] better than Kasumi'sâwith another move so powerful [...] "it's almost unfair to use it." [...] He also noted how she can be actually more effective with her back turned towards her opponent, {{despite the fact that the}} characters cannot block when facing away from an enemy. In his guide to Dead or Alive 3, Alfonso wrote Ayane is a very unpredictable and quick attacker, even more than in the previous games in the series, and should be played primarily for her backwards position, hers being the best such stance of all the characters in the game. Ayane's speed and deceiving attacks make her a [...] "pretty good" [...] partner for slower fighters for tag team battles, but her primary partners are other ninja characters.|$|E
