40|$|Mild steels {{are often}} {{employed}} in high volume of screw machine parts such as shafts, <b>spindles,</b> <b>pins,</b> rods and varieties of component parts where high hardness is required. Although mild steel provides various advantages such as ease of formability, machinability and weldability {{but it is}} unimpressive {{in terms of strength}} and hardness. The most common problem encountered is the short tool life. Hence, the ability to make mild steels hard enough to be the tools that shape all other material is important. Mild steel ability to be hardened is produced in heat treatment and quenching process. Thus, the main objective of this project is to determine the effect of cutting speed and depth of cut on surface roughness of oil-quenched mild steel. Material is prepared by heating mild steel followed by quenching in oil. The hardness of quenched mild steel was tested with Rockwell hardness tester to determine suitable machining parameters. Taguchi and orthogonal array DOE was employed to set up experiments. The surface of oil-quenched mild steel was measured with perthometer and data were collected. Analysis of data obtained were made by using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and validation test were carried out to determine significant parameter affecting surface quality of specimen studied. Conclusions were then made based on results obtained...|$|R
40|$|Condition {{monitoring}} systems of manufacturing processes have been recognised {{in recent years}} as one of the key technologies that provide the competitive advantage in many manufacturing environments. It is capable of providing an essential means to reduce cost, increase productivity, improve quality and prevent damage to the machine or workpiece. Turning operations are {{considered one of the most}} common manufacturing processes in industry. It is used to manufacture different round objects such as shafts, <b>spindles</b> and <b>pins.</b> Despite recent development and intensive engineering research, the development of tool wear {{monitoring systems}} in turning is still ongoing challenge. In this paper, force signals are used for monitoring tool-wear in a feature fusion model. A novel approach for the design of condition monitoring systems for turning operations using novelty detection algorithm is presented. The results found prove that the developed system can be used for rapid design of condition monitoring systems for turning operations to predict tool-wear...|$|R
50|$|The rotors (alternatively wheels or drums, Walzen in German) {{formed the}} heart of an Enigma machine. Each rotor was a disc {{approximately}} 10 cm in diameter made from hard rubber or bakelite with 26 brass, spring-loaded, electrical contact pins arranged in a circle on one face; the other side housing the corresponding number of circular plate electrical contacts. The pins and contacts represent the alphabet—typically the 26 letters A-Z (this will be assumed {{for the rest of this}} description). When the rotors were mounted side-by-side on the <b>spindle,</b> the <b>pins</b> of one rotor rested against the plate contacts of the neighbouring rotor, forming an electrical connection. Inside the body of the rotor, 26 wires connected each pin on one side to a contact on the other in a complex pattern. Most of the rotors were identified by Roman numerals, and each issued copy of rotor I was wired identically to all others. The same was true for the special thin beta and gamma rotors used in the M4 naval variant.|$|R
50|$|A better {{solution}} was to use a single double-sided gab. These were initially X-shaped and sat between the two connecting pins. X-gabs were also usually reversed, so that the gab {{was placed on the}} valve <b>spindle</b> and the <b>pins</b> were instead connected to the eccentric rods. The gab now stayed still vertically and the pins were moved up and down to engage them. This was done by joining both pins with a short vertical bar. The driver's reversing lever moved the centre of this bar, thus the pins, up and down to engage one at a time with opposite faces of the X-gab. This valve gear was used on Stephenson's locomotives of the early 1830s, such as Rocket.|$|R
40|$|SummaryDuring development, {{directional}} {{cell division}} {{is a major}} mechanism for establishing the orientation of tissue growth. Drosophila neuroblasts undergo asymmetric divisions perpendicular to the overlying epithelium to produce descendant neurons on the opposite side, thereby orienting initial neural tissue growth. However, the mechanism remains elusive. We provide genetic evidence that extrinsic GPCR signaling determines the orientation of cortical polarity underlying asymmetric divisions of neuroblasts relative to the epithelium. The GPCR Tre 1 activates the G protein oα subunit in neuroblasts by interacting with the epithelium to recruit <b>Pins,</b> which regulates <b>spindle</b> orientation. Because <b>Pins</b> associates with the Par-complex via Inscuteable, Tre 1 consequently recruits the polarity complex to orthogonally orient the polarity axis to the epithelium. Given the universal role of the Par complex in cellular polarization, we propose that the GPCR-Pins system is a comprehensive mechanism controlling tissue polarity by orienting polarized stem cells and their divisions...|$|R
40|$|Asymmetric {{division}} of neural progenitors {{is a key}} mechanism by which neuronal diversity in the Drosophila central nervous system is generated. The distinct fates of the daughter cells derived from these divisions are achieved through preferential segregation of the cell fate determinants Prospero and Numb {{to one of the}} two daughters. This is achieved by coordinating apical and basal mitotic spindle orientation with the basal cortical localization of the cell fate determinants during mitosis. A complex of apically localized proteins, including Inscuteable (Insc), Partner of Inscuteable (Pins), Bazooka (Baz), DmPar- 6, DaPKC, and Gi, is required to mediate and coordinate basal protein localization with mitotic <b>spindle</b> orientation. <b>Pins,</b> a molecule which directly interacts with Insc, is a key component required for the integrity of this complex; in the absence of Pins, other components become mislocalized or destabilized, and basal protein localization and mitotic spindle orientation are defective. Here we define the functional domains of Pins. We show that the C-terminal region containing the Gi binding GoLoco motifs is necessary and sufficient for targeting to the neuroblast cortex, which appears to be a prerequisite for apical localization of Pins. The N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat-containing region of Pins is required for two processes; TPR repeats 1 to 3 plus the C-terminal region are required for apical localization but are insufficient to recruit Insc to the apical cortex, whereas TPR repeats 1 to 7 plus C-terminal Pins can perform both functions. Hence, the abilities of Pins to cortically localize, t...|$|R

Turning {{is the most}} common process used {{in manufacturing}} sector to produce smooth finish on cylindrical surfaces. Surface roughness is the important performance characteristics to be considered in the turning process is affected by several factors such as cutting tool material, spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut and material properties. In this research Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to determine the optimum machining parameters leading to minimum surface roughness in turning process. The main purpose of this research is to study the effect of carbide inserts on EN- 24 Alloy Steel surface by using three parameters (spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut). This research was conducted by using 100 HS Stallion CNC Lathe machine. Seventeen sets of experiments were performed. In this work empirical models were developed for surface roughness by considering spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut as main controlling factors using response surface methodology. The optimum value of the surface roughness (Ra) comes out to be 0. 48 µm. It is also concluded that feed rate is the most significant factor affecting surface roughness followed by depth of cut. As Cutting speed is the less significant factor affecting surface roughness. Optimum results are finally verified with the help of confirmation experiments. Keywords...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring {{asymmetric}} cell divisions, mitotic spindles align {{along the}} axis of polarization. In invertebrates, <b>spindle</b> positioning requires <b>Pins</b> or related proteins and a G protein α subunit. A mammalian Pins, called LGN, binds Gαi and also interacts through an N-terminal domain with the microtubule binding protein NuMA. During mitosis, LGN recruits NuMA to the cell cortex, while cortical association of LGN itself requires the C-terminal Gα binding domain. Using a FRET biosensor, we find that LGN behaves as a conformational switch: in its closed state, the N and C termini interact, but NuMA or Gαi can disrupt this association, allowing LGN to interact simultaneously with both proteins, resulting in their cortical localization. Overexpression of Gαi or YFP-LGN causes a pronounced oscillation of metaphase spindles, and NuMA binding to LGN is required for these spindle movements. We propose that a related switch mechanism might operate in asymmetric cell divisions in the fly and nematode...|$|R
40|$|During {{asymmetric}} cell division, {{alignment of}} the mitotic spindle with the cell polarity axis ensures that the cleavage furrow separates fate determinants into distinct daughter cells. The protein Inscuteable (Insc) is thought to link cell polarity and spindle positioning in diverse systems by binding the polarity protein Bazooka (Baz; aka Par- 3) and the spindle orienting protein Partner of Inscuteable (Pins; mPins or LGN in mammals). Here we investigate the mechanism of spindle orientation by the Insc-Pins complex. Previously, we defined two <b>Pins</b> <b>spindle</b> orientation pathways: a complex with Mushroom body defect (Mud; NuMA in mammals) is required for full activity, whereas binding to Discs large (Dlg) is sufficient for partial activity. In the current study, we have examined the role of Inscuteable in mediating downstream Pins-mediated spindle orientation pathways. We find that the Insc-Pins complex requires Gai for partial activity and that the complex specifically recruits Dlg but not Mud. In vitro competition experiments revealed that Insc and Mud compete for binding to the Pins TPR motifs, while Dlg can form a ternary complex with Insc-Pins. Our results suggest that Insc does not passively couple polarity and spindle orientation but preferentially inhibits the Mud pathway, while allowing the Dlg pathway to remain active. Inscregulated complex assembly may ensure that the spindle {{is attached to the}} cortex (via Dlg) before activation of spindle pulling forces by Dynein/Dynactin (via Mud) ...|$|R
40|$|Signaling systems {{regulate}} {{the flow of}} cellular information by organizing proteins {{in space and time}} to coordinate a variety of cellular activities that are critical for the proper development, function, and maintenance of cells. Signaling molecules can exhibit several levels of complexity through the utilization of modular protein interactions, which can generate simple linear behaviors or complex behaviors such as ultrasensitivity. Protein modularity also serves {{as the basis for the}} vast protein networks that form the regulatory networks that govern several biological activities. My work focuses on the importance of protein modularity in complex biological systems, in particular the regulatory pathways of spindle positioning. 	The first part of my work involves the construction of a synthetic regulatory network using modular protein interactions in an effort to understand the complex behavior of the natural <b>spindle</b> orientation regulator <b>Pins.</b> Utilizing well-characterized protein domains and their binding partners, I built an autoinhibited protein switch that can be activated by a small protein domain. We found that the input-output relationship of the synthetic protein switch could be tuned by the simple addition of "decoy" domains, domains that bind and sequester input signal, thereby impeding the onset of the output response to generate an input threshold. By varying the number and affinities of the decoy domains, we found that we could transform a simple linear response into a complex, ultrasensitive one. Thus, modular protein interactions can serve as a source of complex behaviors. 	The second part of my work focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying spindle positioning in the Drosophila neuroblast. I found that Pins orients the mitotic spindle by coordinating two opposite-polarity microtubule motors Dynein and Kinesin- 73 through its multiple domains. Kinesin- 73 also relies on its modular domain architecture to perform its duties in Pins-mediated spindle positioning, where its N-terminal half functions in coordinating cortical-microtubule capture while its C-terminal half functions as a region necessary for the activation of Dynein. Thus, modular protein design allows for the organization of spindle orientation regulators in space to achieve the complex biological activity that is spindle positioning.
