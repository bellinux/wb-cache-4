Once a DFIG is subjected to a large voltage dip, a large rotor voltage induces in the rotor windings.

3000|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this research}} is a multi-layered phishing detection method using previously developed modeling techniques that includes topic modeling technique Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), classifier ensemble technique AdaBoost and Co-Training algorithm that employs labeled and unlabeled data. The main goal of our novel approach is to detect phishing before it gets to the user. Towards that goal, we have developed the detection method, called phishGILLNET, by incorporating the power of natural language processing techniques. Similar to a [...] "gillnet" [...] that catches fish by its gill thus preventing its movement once caught, phishGILLNET tries to catch phishing attacks by the tone, wordings, and other linguistic variations in the content. By serving as a server <b>side</b> <b>filter,</b> phishGILLNET prevents movement of a phish towards the end user. The first layer of phishGILLNET (phishGILLNET 1) employs PLSA to build a topic model and uses a topic level similarity function for classification. Unlike earlier approach that employed topic models, our model employed editing function and dictionary lookups to specifically account for intentionally misspelled words in phishing emails. The second layer of phishGILLNET (phishGILLNET 2) employs classifier ensemble technique AdaBoost and topic probabilities as features to build a robust classifier using several base learners. To further expand phishGILLNET to handle labeled and unlabeled email data, the third layer (phishGILLNET 3) employs Co-Training to build a classifier using topic distributions as features and the best classification technique obtained in the second layer. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt that demonstrates the power of topic model using Co-Training for phishing detection. The size of the corpus we employed is significantly larger (approximately 400, 000) than that employed by authors of the Co-Training technique (few thousands) as well as by earlier researchers. Thus, our research is an additional proof of concept of the Co-Training algorithm in employing unlabeled data.|$|E
40|$|For {{transportation}} of fuel from {{the fuel tank}} to the engine a mechanical pump, driven by and mounted on the engine, is generally used in heavy-duty vehicles today. The main reason for using such a pump {{is that it is}} considered being the most robust solution for the simple task of delivering and pressurizing fuel. Today’s pumps are oversized in order to deliver sufficient flow and pressure at engine starting conditions. It is desirable to be able to continuously control fuel flow to reduce the required pump work in cases where today’s pump has overcapacity. An electrically driven pump can be controlled to deliver fuel on demand and also provides other advantages, e. g. free placement, possible downsizing of the pump and additional software features, such as priming and automatic deaeration. The project has been conducted as an exploratory study containing concept generation for component placement and testing of today’s common rail fuel system for specification. Suppliers of fuel pumps and filters have been contacted as an investigation of what the market has to offer today to make an electrified low pressure fuel circuit possible. Since switching to an electric pump enables free placement, a concept was developed where an already planned catch tank solution was combined with the idea of mounting the low pressure fuel pump in-tank. The result came out as a small tech tank, intended to hold all functional components of the fuel system, upstream of the main pressure <b>side</b> <b>filter.</b> This tech tank could be delivered with all Scania products with common rail injection.

Indirect rotor-flux-oriented control and direct torque control are designed and compared for the control of an exemplary high-speed induction machine drive. The 2 L VSC is the most widely applied converter for high-speed drives. However, the 3 L-NPC VSC is an attractive topology if drastically increased switching frequencies are required. A detailed comparison between a 2 L VSC and a 3 L-NPC VSC as the machine side converter of the exemplary high-speed induction machine drive is carried out. Voltage-oriented control is applied for the control of the grid side PWM active front end converter. In several industrial applications PWM active front end converters commonly operate in parallel to thyristor converter fed dc drives. Behavior of the voltage-oriented controlled active front end converter with L-filter in the presence of a parallel thyristor converter is investigated.

40|$|Power {{electronics}} {{applications are}} usually accompanied by high {{voltage and current}} amplitudes, and steep voltage and current transients. The EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) issue {{is regarded as the}} main side effect of power electronics applications. Noise level prediction is a vital task for filter design, but many difficulties are encountered. For instance, a large amount of experience is needed to build equivalent circuits, the use of simplified models often requires sacrificing details in the high frequency range, individual approaches must be developed for various topologies, etc [...] A new method for EMI prediction of power electronics applications is thus desirable. The universal method should overcome the following common characteristics of power electronics circuits: (a) the large difference between the time constants, and (b) the long time required to reach steady state. The time domain approach is very time-consuming. The assumptions used in the frequency domain approach, namely, periodic noise sources and a fixed propagation path, are also not valid. For example, the slopes of voltage and current transients depend on the operating points, and the assumption of periodic noise sources does not apply. Because the junction capacitors of power rectifiers and switches change with the reverse voltage, the values of the components in the noise propagation path also change. In this thesis, a hierarchical approach is proposed for the EMC design of inverters in motor drive systems. It combines the advantage of the time domain and frequency domain approach to achieve a fast, universal and accurate result. The approach is validated by observations in the time domain and the frequency domain. The proposed approach has three steps. In the first step (functional level), a simple model of switches in the system is developed. The operating points of each switching transient and all time intervals are derived and the narrowband signals of the EMI noise can be derived. The second step (transient level) results in detailed transient waveforms which take the variation of the nonlinear switching transient into account. In the third step (propagation level), the noise propagation through the system is described by the transfer ratio, and the EMC performance is evaluated. The approach is described in detail, and then a PWM voltage source inverter feeding an induction motor is analyzed using this approach. This approach is also applied to a resonant inverter that operates under ZVS conditions. The experimental results are compared to calculated results. Two approaches are proposed for EMI suppression in this thesis. The first approach is by adding a passive filter on the dc-bus. It can be concluded that the same noise suppression performance can be achieved using a dc-bus filter as the conventional ac <b>side</b> <b>filter.</b> The advantage of this approach is that the connections can be made very short which can significantly improve the suppression. A new active filter called the "fourth leg compensator" is proposed in this thesis. The fourth leg inverter generates a signal to compensate the transients of other three legs. It can suppress the fast transients of common mode voltages while reducing the amplitude of the common mode voltage by 50 %. A method to determine the values of the additional components is described. It is shown that the CM voltage can be compensated, even with nonideal coupling in the CM transformer and when leakage inductance is present.

40|$|Modern society uses {{electrical}} energy {{for a wide}} range of needs and requirements. Electrical energy is considered high value as it requires a prior conversion step from kinetic/thermal or solar energy. However, electrical power is always defined by certain properties which typically need to be adjusted in multiple stages to satisfy the specifications of electrical loads such as motors, lighting and consumer electronics. For DC (direct current) power systems, switching DC-DC power converters are the state-of-the-art solution to achieve a low-loss modification of the voltage magnitude. The Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converter is an attractive DC-DC conversion topology that can widely satisfy the future needs of DC power management and the integration of electro-chemical storage. It offers an unmatched capability to transfer energy in either direction between two DC sources while its inherent Zero Voltage Switching capability offers potential for high conversion efficiency and high power density. The current and future research activities on DAB converters mainly focus on maximising the power density through a volume reduction of the embedded passive power devices. This trend is encouraged by the market introduction of wide bandgap fast-switching semiconductor devices using Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium-Nitride (GaN) to replace conventional Silicon material in many applications. The reduced parasitic capacitance and transition time of these devices allow to significantly increase the converter operating frequencies, which is the only way to increase the power density unless the material specifications of passive power devices drastically evolve. However, a higher operating frequency inevitably leads to a stronger influence of practical second-order effects, which for a DAB, particularly address the non-ideality of the switch devices, the parasitic coupling impedances in the high-frequency transformer, the peripheral connecting traces of the AC link network and the DC bus filter. Hence, all these effects have to be accommodated by a universal design framework which is yet to be found in literature. A DAB is conventionally designed using time domain analysis of the modulation sequence and device waveforms to evaluate its key performance design criteria such as active power transfer, Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) and AC link circulating power. This analysis technique typically presumes an idealized single parameter AC link inductance to substitute for the more complex circuit model of a practical high-frequency transformer. This becomes particularly relevant as the operating frequencies increase, causing both active and passive power devices to become less ideal. More than that, advanced multi-level DAB Phase Shifted Square Wave (PSSW) modulation strategies lead to a wide solution space of control parameters that can be used to enhance the performance of a DAB by shaping the AC link current in certain ways. Within the time domain, such volatile modulation strategies require a complicated structure model analysis. This thesis now shows how to apply frequency domain harmonic analysis techniques to a DAB DC-DC converter. The approach readily accommodates the influence of complex impedance structures, practical switching effects and advanced multi-level modulation concepts, and leads to generic numerical and analytical solution expressions that significantly enhance the converter design process. The work thus establishes a new analysis strategy in the advancing field of DAB research. The thesis begins with the harmonic decomposition of the bridge output voltages and the expression of the DAB coupling network as a generic two-port impedance model. These steps establish the frequency domain analysis (FDA) framework. Next, the FDA approach is applied to derive explicit solution terms for the ZVS regions of single and three-phase DAB converters, which are crucial to minimise the power loss of the semiconductor devices during the switching transition. These expressions are used to separately investigate the impact of single impedance parameters, non-ideal switching transitions and PSSW modulation concepts on the ZVS limiting conditions, which determine the preferable operating regions to achieve minimum switching loss operation and best possible controllability of the DAB. From this work, it is shown how a single element high-frequency transformer with a reduced coupling factor is sufficient to ensure continuous and reliable ZVS operation without adding software or auxiliary hardware complexity. More than that, the strategy quantifies the impedance design parameters of the coupling network in correlation with the selected PSSW modulation concept. In this context, the benefit of adaptive 3 -level DAB modulation is presented to support continuous ZVS operation and thus allow for high-efficient operation of a single phase DAB across its entire operating range. Finally, the established modeling framework is extended to identify the DC bus harmonics injected by the PSSW modulation process, for any particular DAB design and operating context. It is also shown how adaptive modulation can be used to mitigate certain harmonic frequencies that can otherwise cause severe harmonic interferences, DC bus oscillations, and thus impact on the DC <b>side</b> <b>filter</b> design process. To complete the work, experimental results are presented to verify the analytical development, using a laboratory DAB converter that can operate across a wide range of DC voltages at power levels up to 1 kW. Simultaneously, as part of an industry project with BOSCH, a customised 1. 2 kW DAB prototype was built using the presented design guidelines, which achieved a conversion efficiency between 96. 5 % and 98. 5 % across the operating range...|$|E

Power transformers {{are an integral}} part of power systems. In many applications, like wind energy conversion and electric ship, the large weight and volume of present 60 Hz power transformer is a limitation. The size of transformers can be reduced by replacing the power transformers with high frequency transformers. For use of high frequency transformer in power systems, first the low frequency voltages are converted to high frequency by a power electronic converter and then it is stepped up or down by the high frequency transformer and finally the high frequency voltage is converter to low frequency by a second power electronic converter. The whole system is termed as power electronic transformer (PET). Matrix converter(MC) based power electronic transformers are the focus of this doctoral research. Direct AC to AC conversion using matrix converters have the major advantage of absence of storage capacitors over AC-DC-AC based conversion systems. A matrix converter based PET with open ended primary is described in this thesis. It has the salient features of controllable output voltage frequency, controllable input power factor, bi-directional power flow, zero common mode voltage and voltage transfer ratio of 1. 5. The described PET is analyzed and simulation results are presented. Commutation of current in the leakage inductance is one of the challenges in the matrix converter based PET. The effect on voltage regulation due to increase in leakage inductance is studied using extensive simulation. An alternative path is needed for change of direction of current during commutation time. One of the ways to provide alternative path is use of clamp circuits. But use of clamp circuits lead to energy loss unless efficient energy recovery systems are designed. A source based commutation method is proposed to eliminate the use of clamp circuits. Depending on the direction of current in the HF transformer, the matrix converters on primary side of the transformer are switched such that natural commutation takes place in the leakage inductances. The overall efficiency of the PET is significantly improved. The commutation time is dependent on the value of leakage inductance. So, higher the leakage inductance, larger the commutation time and therefore, lower is the switching frequency. The nano-crystalline materials used for making HF transformers have very low core losses at very high frequencies as compared to 60 Hz power transformers. Also, power devices made of SiC devices are available which can operate at very high switching frequencies with very low switching losses. Therefore, leakage inductance is the only factor that limits the switching frequency. To solve the above mentioned problem, three novel PET topologies are proposed in which the switching frequency is independent of the value of leakage inductance. The first one is sinusoidal input output three phase HF transformer. It has a three phase low pass filter and a matrix converter on both primary and secondary side of the HF transformer. Three square wave voltages at switching frequency, phase shifted by 120 ◦ are produced by the primary side MC. The square wave voltages are filtered by the primary <b>side</b> <b>filter</b> to give three sine waves at high frequency shifted by 120 ◦. The switched currents at the input of secondary side MC are filtered by the secondary side low pass filter. The HF transformer works like a three phase power transformer. The second topology proposed is sinusoidal input output three winding HF transformer. In this topology, the supply voltages are first converted to square wave voltage at high frequency by a three phase to single phase MC and then filtered to a sine wave by a low pass filter connected to primary of the HF transformer. Two opposite sine voltages at high frequency are produced by the three winding transformer, on the secondary side, which is further connected to two capacitors. The switched currents on the input of MC, connected to load, are filtered by these two capacitors. The transformer again sees sinusoidal voltages and currents as in the first topology. Zero common mode voltage is achieved in this topology by use of a modified pulse density modulation(PDM) strategy proposed. The third one proposed is sinusoidal current HF transformer. Unlike the first two, it does not has a filter on the primary side. A high frequency square wave voltage is produced by a three phase to single phase MC. A MC is connected between the secondary terminals and the load. PDM is used for secondary side MC. A low pass filter is formed with the transformer by connecting a capacitor at the secondary terminals. Both, the switched currents at input of secondary side MC and the square wave voltages across the primary windings are filtered by the low pass filter. Thus, only sinusoidal currents flow through the HF transformer. In all the above three mentioned topologies, the leakage inductance is used to form the low pass filter, minimizing the amount of reactive elements required. As these low pass filters are required to filter very high frequency voltages, the size of reactive elements are reduced. For the sinusoidal current HF transformer only one additional capacitor is needed. Also because of use of PDM, zero voltage switching is possible for the sinusoidal three winding and sinusoidal current transformers. All the proposed topologies are analyzed and simulated in MATLAB/ SIMULINK environment and the simulation results are presented. Mathematical model for filter design is provided. A laboratory prototype is built for sinusoidal current HF transformer and the experimental results are presented...|$|E

40|$|The OBSERVER {{design pattern}} {{is one of}} the most widely used {{patterns}} from the original GoF book [1]. With the proliferation of mobile devices in worklife and information systems serving data to such devices is paramount to maintaining data integrity in a work process. The idiosyncracies of mobile devices have placed new requirements on the mechanisms for updating resource limited clients 1 with an OBSERVER style solution. This work provides an adapted pattern named INTELLIGENT SUBJECT that allows for a SUBJECT <b>side</b> <b>filtering</b> mechanism to avoid propagating all updates to all OBSERVERS if the cost of notification is high. This cost could be either due to resource or network constraints. OBSERVERS define threshold values, and are only notified when the data value is changed beyond their individual threshold. The pattern introduces slightly more complexity, but allows for a separation of concerns on the SUBJECT side and a life of blissful ignorance on the OBSERVER side...|$|R
