25|$|In {{the warmer}} summer months, common box turtles {{are more likely}} to be seen near the edges of swamps or marshlands, {{possibly}} in an effort to <b>stay</b> <b>cool.</b> If common box turtles do become too hot, (when their body temperature rises to around 32°C), they smear saliva over their legs and head; as the saliva evaporates it leaves them comfortably cooler. Similarly, the turtle may urinate on its hind limbs to cool the body parts it is unable to cover with saliva.|$|E
25|$|A cool box, cooler, {{portable}} ice chest, chilly bin, or esky {{most commonly}} is an insulated box {{used to keep}} perishable food or beverages cool. Ice cubes, which are very cold, are most commonly placed in it to make the things inside <b>stay</b> <b>cool.</b> Ice packs are sometimes used, as they either contain the melting water inside, or have a gel sealed inside that also stays cold longer than plain water. The cooler was invented in 1951 by Richard C. Laramy of Joliet, Illinois. Laramy filed a patent for the cooler on February 24, 1951 and was issued U.S. patent #2,663,157 on December 22, 1953.|$|E

While designed to use the 600hp Curtiss H-1640-1 Chieftain engine, (a novel 12-cylinder two-row air-cooled radial with the rear cylinders directly behind the front cylinders rather than staggered as normal in a two-row radial) for which the XP-13 incorporated a complex system of baffles to direct cooling air over the engine, the engine simply would not <b>stay</b> <b>cool</b> enough, and in September 1930 it was replaced with a Pratt & Whitney SR1340C Wasp of 450hp. Ironically, the lower-power engine actually resulted in a speed increase of 15mph, at least {{partly because of the}} weight savings.|$|E

25|$|The {{emergence}} of Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble in 1989 and 1990 was to herald {{an era of}} Indian cricket that was dominated by stars and individual brilliance. Sachin Tendulkar became arguably the best batsman in the world, along with Brian Lara of the West Indies and in 1998, Sir Donald Bradman himself remarked that Tendulkar batting style was similar to his. Mohammed Azharuddin, who captained India {{for most of the}} 1990s, proved a captain whose main strength, if not his motivational skills, was an ability to <b>stay</b> <b>cool</b> under pressure. Azharuddin's artistic batting however declined during the later years of his captaincy, and his best innings during this time were mostly when playing at home. The Hyderabadi stylist's career ended after 99 Tests when he was banned for life after being implicated in the match-fixing scandal. Under his captaincy, the Indian team became virtually unbeatable at home, with big wins against teams such as England, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Australia. Their performances abroad, however, left a lot to be desired.|$|E
500|$|Pinnipeds {{conserve}} {{heat with}} their large and compact body size, insulating blubber and fur, and high metabolism. In addition, {{the blood vessels}} in their flippers are adapted for countercurrent exchange. Veins containing cool blood from the body extremities surround arteries, which contain warm blood received from {{the core of the}} body. Heat from the arterial blood is transferred to the blood vessels, which then recirculate blood back to the core. The same adaptations that conserve heat while in water tend to inhibit heat loss when out of water. To counteract overheating, many species cool off by flipping sand onto their backs, adding a layer of cool, damp sand that enhances heat loss. The northern fur seal [...] to help <b>stay</b> <b>cool,</b> while monk seals often dig holes in the sand to expose cooler layers to rest in.|$|E

In the April 2007 issue of Stuff Magazine Nelson was interviewed about his long locks. [...] "I started braiding my hair when it started getting too long, and that was, I don't know, probably in the 70's." [...] On May 26, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Nelson had cut his hair, and Nashville music journalist Jimmy Carter published {{a photograph of the}} pigtail-free Nelson on his website.

500|$|The Morrison Formation {{environment}} in which Amphicoelias lived would have resembled a modern savanna, though since grass did not appear until the Late Cretaceous, ferns were probably the dominant plant and main food source for Amphicoelias. Though Engelmann et al. (2004) dismissed ferns as a sauropod food source due to their relatively low caloric content, Carpenter argued that the sauropod digestive system, well adapted to handle low-quality food, allows for the consumption of ferns as {{a large part of}} the sauropod diet. Carpenter also noted that the occasional presence of large petrified logs indicate the presence of [...] tall trees, which would seem to conflict with the savanna comparison. However, the trees are rare, and since tall trees require more water than the savanna environment could generally provide, they probably existed in narrow tracts or [...] "gallery forests" [...] along rivers and gulleys where water could accumulate. Carpenter speculated that giant herbivores like Amphicoelias may have used the shade of the gallery forests to <b>stay</b> <b>cool</b> during the day, and done most of their feeding on the open savanna at night.|$|E
500|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman {{was first}} {{described}} by the French zoologist Georges Cuvier in 1807 {{and is one of}} only two species in the genus Paleosuchus, the other species being P.trigonatus. Their closest relatives are the other caimans in the subfamily Caimaninae. With a total length averaging [...] for males and typically up to [...] for females, Cuvier's dwarf caiman is not only the smallest extant species in the alligator and caiman family, but also the smallest of all crocodilians. An adult will typically weigh around [...] Its lack of size is partly made up for by its strong body armour, provided by the bony bases to its dermal scales, which provides protection against predators. Juvenile dwarf caimans mainly feed on invertebrates, but also small fish and frogs, while adults eat larger fish, amphibians and invertebrates, such as large molluscs. This caiman sometimes uses a burrow as shelter during the day and in the Pantanal may aestivate in the burrow in order to <b>stay</b> <b>cool</b> in the dry season. The female buries her eggs on a mounded nest and these take about three months to hatch. She helps the hatchlings to escape from the nest and provides some parental care for the first few weeks of their life. This caiman has a wide range and large total population and the IUCN lists its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E

The issues centered on the bassist, Sami Vänskä, who had started misbehaving towards the band, according to Holopainen, by missing appointments and failing to take gigs as seriously as the other members did. After the band discussed his behavior with Vänskä several times, without getting any change, everyone simply stopped caring and tensions grew. Meanwhile, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen had started complaining about his role in the band, feeling like [...] "a hired gun who would only do what he's asked to".
