The contents of triacylglycerols, fatty acids, aliphatic and terpenic alcohols, desmethyl-, methyl-, and dimethylsterols, squalene, and tocopherols were determined. Oleic, palmitic, and linoleic acids were the main fatty acids. Desmethylsterols were the principal minor compounds with β-sitosterol being the most abundant component. Low amounts of aliphatic and terpenic alcohols were also found. The major tocopherol in hazelnut and <b>sweet</b> <b>almond</b> <b>oils</b> was α-tocopherol, whereas γ-tocopherol prevailed in pecan nut oil.

Methods: This study was a nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design. The subjects were 58 hospice patients with terminal cancer who were hospitalized. Twenty eight hospice patients with terminal cancer were assigned to the experimental group (aroma hand massage), and 30 hospice patients with terminal cancer were assigned to the control group (general oil hand massage).

In the present study, the amount and constituents of oil of six Amygdalus species including A. communis, A.

Methods: The oil of the plants fruits were obtained with hot and cold methods using n-hexane and their percentages were compared. Then, the oils were analysed by GC after methylation of their constituents. Results: The results demonstrated that the hot method gave higher oil yield than cold method. The amounts of the species oils were almost similar except for A. Iranshahrii which contained the least amount of the oil. The most dominant constituents of the oils comprised of palmitic, stearic, oleic and linoleic acids with almost the same pattern, consisting of mostly oleic acid followed by linoleic and palmitic acids.

Among them Trichophyton equinum, which mostly infects equids, can cause extensive outbreaks in stud farms. The conventional treatment of equine trichophytosis is topic, based upon medicated shampoos to reduce the spread of infection among the animals. Nevertheless the popularity of phytotherapy is at an all-time peak, and the interest for natural alternatives or complements to conventional drug therapy is challenging both in human and veterinary field. Among herbal remedia Tea Tree Oil (TTO) shows a wide range of antimicrobial activities. A randomized open clinical trial was carried out on 60 thoroughbred breeding horses affected by equine ringworm. The animals were randomly divided into 2 groups of 30 subjects. Diagnostic criteria were the presence of clinical signs and positive T equinum culture. Specificity control using TTO mixture in 5 not dermatophyte affected animals was achieved also. The antimycotic activity against T equinum of a mixture containing 25 % TTO in <b>sweet</b> <b>almond</b> <b>oil,</b> was evaluated in vivo treating 30 subjects, the others were administered enilconazole 2 % solution. The animals of both groups were topically treated twice a day for 15 days with a 25 % mixture of TTO diluted in <b>sweet</b> <b>almond</b> <b>oil</b> and every 3 days, four times with enilconazole rinses, respectively.

T. serpillum and O. vulgare showed the lowest MICs, followed by I. verum, R. officinalis and C. limon. The assay performed on mixture showed that antimycotic activity of each component was enhanced. Four out of seven treated cats recovered both clinically and culturally. T serpillum and O. vulgare EOs showed a strong antifungal activity.
