40|$|The study {{investigated}} the relationship among three cognitive styles and summarization abilities. Both summarization products and processes were examined. <b>Summarizing</b> products were scored and a canonical correlation analysis was performed to determine their relationship with three cognitive styles. <b>Summarizing</b> processes were examined by videotaping students as they provided think aloud protocols. Their processes were recorded on composing style sheets and analyzed qualitatively. Subjects were sixth-grade students in self-contained classes in a suburban school district. <b>Summarizing</b> products were collected over a two week period in the fall. <b>Summarizing</b> processes were collected over an eight week period {{in the spring of}} the same school year. The results of the <b>summarizing</b> products analysis suggest that cognitive styles are related to summarization abilities. Two canonical correlations among the two variable sets were statistically significant at the. 05 level of significance (. 33 and. 29). The results further suggest that students who are field independent, reflective, and flexible in their attentional style may be more adept at organizing their ideas and using written mechanics while <b>summarizing.</b> Students who are impulsive and constricted in attentional style may exhibit strength in expressing their ideas while <b>summarizing.</b> Results of the <b>summarizing</b> processes analysis suggest that students of one cognitive style combination may exhibit different behaviors while <b>summarizing</b> than those of other cognitive style combinations. Students who are field independent, reflective, and flexible in their attentional style seem to display more mature, interactive behaviors while <b>summarizing</b> than their peers of other cognitive style combinations...|$|R
