40|$|Abstract ― It is {{commonly}} known that water repellency {{of the fabric}} treated with fluorocarbon resin brings about a decrease by the washing and recovers by the subsequent heat treatment. In this article, effect of the water repellency was investigated on the nylon 6, triacetate and silk fabrics treated with hydrocarbon and <b>silicon</b> <b>resins.</b> Hydrocarbon and <b>silicon</b> <b>resins</b> {{have been widely used}} in the textile finishing as the softening and water proofing agents. The fabrics were treated with hydrocarbon resins, Paragium JQ and RC (Ohara Paragium Chemical Co.) and a silicon resin, Poron MR (Shinetsu Chemical Co.), and then washed and subsequently heat treated. Although the water repellency increased by the resin treatment, it decreased by the washing apparently and recovered a little by the heat treatment. The effect of the heat treatment was small comparing with that of the fluorocarbon resin. Furthermore, as a mechanical property of the treated fabric, KES shearing and bending hysteresis parameters, modulus and hysteresis width of the hydrocarbon resin-treated nylon 6, triacetate and silk fabrics decreased by the heat treatment after washing. Therefore, the treatment is effective at improving the softening of the fabric in water repellent finish...|$|E

(1999), {{as a means of}} delaying concrete deterioration due to sulfate attack, carbonation, and chloride-induced reinforcement corrosion. The following sealers and coatings were investigated: sodium silicate; <b>silicon</b> <b>resin</b> solution; silane/siloxane; silane/siloxane with an acrylic topcoat; alkyl-alkoxy silane; and a two-component acrylic coating. Silane/siloxane with an acrylic topcoat and a two-component acrylic coating were reported to be most effective in preventing the carbonation of concrete. Silane and silane/siloxane with a topcoat were effective in reducing chloride-induced reinforcement corrosion of in-service structures. Silane/siloxane with an acrylic topcoat was the most effective in minimizing the damage due to sulfate attack. On the other hand, silane/siloxane with acrylic topcoat and acrylic coating were effective in reducing ingress of CO 2. The study ranked the treatments investigated in the following order (from best performance to worst performance): silane/siloxane with an acrylic topcoat; silane, silane/siloxane; <b>silicon</b> <b>resin</b> solution; and, sodium silicate (Ibrahim et al. 1999).|$|R

Dense, pure, crack free mullite were prepared by the heating in air of a mixture of silicone resin and alumina nanoparticles in the temperature range 1200 - 1500 °C. The high reactivity of Al 2 O 3 towards silica, coupled with nanometric size, led to a large volume fraction of mullite crystals even at low firing temperatures (1250 °C). β-SiAlON ceramics were prepared by the heating of mixture a mixture of silicone resin and nanoparticles consisting of both Al 2 O 3 and Si 3 N 4, in the temperature range 1450 - 1550 °C in nitrogen atmosphere. The formation of SiAlON {{was found to be}} preceded by the formation of intermediate alumino-silicate phases like mullite and sillimanite, successively reduced (due to the carbon content of the ceramic residue of <b>silicon</b> <b>resins)</b> and nitrided.

40|$|In this work, the {{experimentation}} {{of protective}} treatments on yellow and grey tuff-stones, characteristic materials {{of the historic}} buildings of Salerno (Italy), was performed. Tuff-stones, due to their high porosity, are often interested by damage phenomena from salt crystallization and other deterioration mechanisms mediated by water. As a consequence, they show a weak durability and require frequent maintenance and restorations. The study was carried out using several commercial polymericresins, with different chemical composition, as protective coatings suitable for prevent water from entering into the porous material. In particular, siloxane, silicon and fluorinated resins, in solvent and/or in water solution, were considered. The protectiveness of the treatments was evaluated performing capillary absorption and total immersion tests and salts crystallization cycles, both on untreated and treated samples. Moreover, the hydrophobic properties of the surface were determined by static contact angle measurements on the treated samples. In order to estimate the over time effectiveness of the treatments, colorimetric measurements and UV weathering tests were also carried out. Finally, using the experimental data, a static durability indicator was calculated as proposed in the literature, in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of each treatment on the potential durability of the treated tuff samples.

30|$|Generally, the EP {{toughening}} methods mainly include {{thermoplastic resin}} toughening, rubber toughening, organic <b>silicon</b> <b>resin</b> toughening, rigid particle toughening and nano-particles toughening, etc. Rubber toughening mechanism is the “silver streaks—nail anchor” mechanism and “silver lines—shear zone” mechanism (Yahyaie and Ebrahimi 2013). After having toughened with rubber, {{the resistance to}} impact and bending performances have been significantly improved (Rahman et al. 2013), however, the strength, modulus and heat resistance performance is weakened due to the lower strength and modulus of rubber. Thermoplastic resin modified by rubber can improve the toughness (Giannotti et al. 2003), but the stiffness and heat resistance are reduced. Nano-particles have large surface activity, which is easy to produce physical or chemical combination with the polymer (Al-Turaif 2010), which can resist micro-crack initiation. Compared with EP composite material toughened by rubber, the strength and rigidity are decreased (Créac’hcadec et al. 2014).|$|R

40|$|In many cases, {{service life}} of {{reinforced}} concrete structures is severely limited by chloride penetration until the steel reinforcement or by carbonation of the covercrete. Water repellent treatment on {{the surfaces of}} cement-based materials has often been considered to protect concrete from these deteriorations.

Penetration profiles of <b>silicon</b> <b>resin</b> in treated concrete have been determined by FT-IR spectroscopy. Water capillary suction, chloride penetration, carbonation, and reinforcement corrosion in both surface impregnated and untreated specimens have been measured. Results indicate that surface impregnation reduced the coefficient of capillary suction of concrete substantially. An efficient chloride barrier can be established by deep impregnation. Water repellent surface impregnation by silanes also can make the process of carbonation action slow. In addition, it also has been concluded that surface impregnation can provide effective corrosion protection to reinforcing steel in concrete with migrating chloride. The improvement of durability and extension of service life for reinforced concrete structures, therefore, can be expected through the applications of appropriate water repellent surface impregnation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are photosensors {{widely used}} for imaging in a vari-ety of high energy and nuclear physics experiments. In noble-gas {{detectors}} for double-beta decay and dark matter experiments, SiPMs are attractive photosensors for imaging. However they are {{insensitive to the}} VUV scintillation emitted by the noble gases (xenon and argon). This difficulty is overcome in the NEXT experiment by coating the SiPMs with tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) to con-vert the VUV light into visible light. TPB requires stringent storage and operational conditions to prevent its degradation by environmental agents. The development of UV sensitive SiPMs is thus of utmost interest for experiments using electroluminescence of noble-gas detectors. It is in partic-ular an important issue for a robust and background free ββ 0 ν experiment with xenon gas aimed by NEXT. The photon detection efficiency (PDE) of UV-enhanced SiPMs provided by Hamamatsu was determined for light in the range 250 – 500 nm. The PDE of standard SiPMs of the same model (S 10362 - 33 - 50 C), coated and non-coated with TPB, was also determined for comparison. In the UV range 250 – 350 nm, the PDE of the standard SiPM is shown to decrease strongly, down to about 3 %.

Results: Plastinated bones prepared by this technique were found to be dried, non-fragile, durable, odorless, non-greasy, and demonstrating all detailed structures of the bones. Tensile and weight tests results indicated that plastinated decalcified femurs have owned higher flexibility and strength but lesser weight than plastinated undecalcified femurs. The characteristics of both experimental and control groups of plastinated decalcified specimens were found to have no significant difference. Conclusions: Our synthesized resin found to be much more economical than conventional plastination method. In more details, properties of these new products were the same as, S 10 method, from points of strength, flexibility and weight, but, since the money cost for producing them was about one fifth that of S 10 method...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a chapter}} from the book, Engineering Aspects of Food Emulsification and Homogenization [© Taylor & Francis Group]. This chapter {{deals with the}} production, properties, and macrofluidic {{applications}} of Shirasu Porous Glass (SPG) membrane. The first section {{provides an overview of}} the membrane microfluidic processes used for production and modification of liquid-liquid and gas-liquid micro- and nano-dispersions, such as direct and premix membrane emulsification with and without phase inversion, membrane demulsification, membrane micromixing / direct precipitation and micro- and nano-bubbling. In the last section of this chapter, SPG membranes are compared with conventional homogenisers and microfluidic drop generators in terms of production rate, droplet size uniformity, and applied shear stresses. The second section deals with the fabrication of SPG membrane by spinodal decomposition in Na 2 O– CaO–Al 2 O 3 –B 2 O 3 –SiO 2 type glass and morphological, mechanical, and hydrodynamic properties of SPG membrane. This chapter also covers modification of surface charge, contact angle and porosity of SPG membrane using different physical and chemical methods, such as deposition of silica nanoparticles onto membrane surface, coating with <b>silicon</b> <b>resin,</b> filling the pores with solvent-responsive polymer chains and chemical modification with silane coupling agents. The fourth section is focused on the effects of physical properties of the dispersed and continuous phase, operating parameters and membrane properties on the droplet size in direct and premix SPG membrane emulsification. In addition, the most common classes of micro- and nano-particles fabricated using SPG membrane were reviewed and their fabrication routes were discussed. It was concluded that a broad variety of different chemical and physicochemical processes can be combined with SPG membrane emulsification to convert droplets into uniform particle. The last section briefly discusses the generation of micro- and nano-bubbles using SPG membrane...|$|R
40|$|Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are photosensors {{widely used}} for imaging {{in a variety}} of high energy and nuclear physics experiments. In noble-gas {{detectors}} for double-beta decay and dark matter experiments, SiPMs are attractive photosensors for imaging. However they are insensitive to the VUV scintillation emitted by the noble gases (xenon and argon). This difficulty is overcome in the NEXT experiment by coating the SiPMs with tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) to convert the VUV light into visible light. TPB requires stringent storage and operational conditions to prevent its degradation by environmental agents. The development of UV sensitive SiPMs is thus of utmost interest for experiments using electroluminescence of noble-gas detectors. It is in particular an important issue for a robust and background free neutrinoless double-beta experiment with xenon gas aimed by NEXT. The photon detection efficiency (PDE) of UV-enhanced SiPMs provided by Hamamatsu was determined for light in the range 250 - 500 nm. The PDE of standard SiPMs of the same model (S 10362 - 33 - 50 C), coated and non-coated with TPB, was also determined for comparison. In the UV range 250 - 350 nm, the PDE of the standard SiPM is shown to decrease strongly, down to about 3 %. The UV-enhanced SiPM without window is shown to have the maximum PDE of 44 % at 325 nm and 30 % at 250 nm. The PDE of the UV-enhanced SiPM with <b>silicon</b> <b>resin</b> window has a similar trend in the UV range, although it is about 30 % lower. The TPB-coated SiPM has shown to have about 6 times higher PDE than the non-coated SiPM in the range 250 - 315 nm. This is however below the performance of the UV-enhanced prototypes in the same wavelength range. Imaging in noble-gas detectors using UV-enhanced SiPMs is discussed.

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>silicon</b> modified <b>resins</b> for graphite fiber laminates which will prevent the dispersal of graphite fibers when the composites are burned is discussed. Eighty-five silicone modified resins were synthesized and evaluated including unsaturated polyesters, thermosetting methacrylates, epoxies, polyimides, and phenolics. Neat resins were judged {{in terms of}} Si content, homogeneity, hardness, Char formation, and thermal stability. Char formation was estimated by thermogravimetry to 1, 000 C in air and in N 2. Thermal stability was evaluated by isothermal weight loss measurements for 200 hrs in air at three temperatures. Four silicone modified epoxies were selected for evaluation in unidirectional filament wound graphite laminates. Neat samples of these resins had 1, 000 C char residues of 25 to 50 %. The highest flexural values measured for the laminates were a strength of 140 kpsi and a modulus of 10 Mpsi. The highest interlaminar shear strength was 5. 3 kpsi...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This work {{is aimed}} at {{optimizing}} the various parameters of the electro discharge machining process in order to Maximize material removal rate (MRR) and Minimize electrode wear rate (EWR) for machining <b>silicon</b> or <b>resin</b> bonded <b>silicon</b> carbide, which is widely used in various applications like high-temperature gas turbines, bearings, seals and linings of industrial furnaces. The five parameters being optimized are intensity supplied by the generator of the EDM machine, open voltage, pulse on time, duty cycle and pressure of flushing fluid. The polynomial models for MRR and EWR proposed by Luis, Puertas and Villa [1] {{in terms of the}} five input parameters was used for formation of the objective function. Optimization was carried out using the multi objective genetic algorithm, which is a heuristic search technique that mimics natural selection. A Pareto-optimal front was obtained using this technique, and the points lying on this front represent the set of optimal solutions for the optimization problem. The resultant Pareto – optimal front can be used to select the appropriate operating conditions depending on the specific MRR, EWR or combination requirements...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a way of harvesting electrical energy from ocean power, e. g. tide, current wave, breaking wave and vortex, using a Flexible PiezoElectric Device (FPED) consisting of polyvinyledene fluoride (PVDF) and elastic material such as rubber, <b>silicon</b> and <b>resin.</b> The proposed FPED has a multi-layered structure with a distance between FPEDs located away from centerline of the FPED. When the FPED can be easily deformed by ocean power, the PVDF laminated in the FPED can be expanded and compressed and then the internal strain energy {{can be stored in}} the FPED. The electric power is generated when the electric polarization occurs in the PVDF. In this study, we have proposed an ocean power generator of EFHAS (Elastic Floating unit with HAnging Structures) consisting of floating unit and hanging unit using the FPEDs to obtain electric power from ocean energy. We investigated a structure of the EFHAS and also examined characteristics of motion and electric performance of the EFHAS (1 / 50 - 1 / 75 scale model.

40|$|The effects the {{thickness}} of epoxy resin on the stress intensity factors (SIFs) of the edge-cracked adhesive joints subjected to external loads are investigated in the current paper. The three-layered joints composed of <b>Silicon,</b> epoxy <b>resin</b> and FR- 4. 5 are widely seen in the package solutions of CSP/FBGA for electronic devices. Cracks or delaminations from resin-substrate interface or resin-silicon interface are the common failure modes in plastic IC packages. However, {{it is difficult to}} determine the exact stress state of a bi-material interface due to the oscillatory singularity. In this paper, the SIFs of the single edge-cracked joints are determined accurately by using the Crack Tip Stress Method. Then, the effects of resin thickness on the SIFs of various edge interface cracks under uniform tension are investigated by varying the resin thickness and crack length. It was found that the SIFs grow with the increment of resin thickness and reach constants when the resin thickness is larger than the width of the joint. 2014 15 th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology (ICEPT 2014), August 12 - 15, 2014, Chengdu, Chin...|$|R

40|$|Black manganese-rich crusts {{are found}} {{worldwide}} on the façades of historical buildings. In this study, they were studied exemplarily on the façade of the Freiburger Münster (Freiburg Minster), Germany, and measured in-situ by portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The XRF was calibrated {{to allow the}} conversion from apparent mass fractions to Mn surface density (Mn mass per area), {{to compensate for the}} fact that portable XRF mass fraction measurements from thin layers violate the assumption of a homogeneous measurement volume. Additionally, 200 -nm femtosecond laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (fs LA-ICP-MS) measurements, scanning transmission X-ray microscopy-near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (STXM-NEXAFS), Raman spectroscopy, and imaging by light microscopy were conducted to obtain further insight into the crust material, such as potential biogenic contributions, element distributions, trace element compositions, and organic functional groups. While black crusts of various types are present at many places on the minster's facade, crusts rich in Mn (with a Mn surface density > 150 μg cm− 2) are restricted to a maximum height of about 7 m. The only exceptions are those developed on the Renaissance-Vorhalle (Renaissance Portico) at a height of about 8 m. This part of the façade had been cleaned and treated with a <b>silicon</b> <b>resin</b> as recently as 2003. These crusts thus accumulated over a period of only 12 years. Yet, they are exceptionally Mn-rich with a surface density of 1200 μg cm− 2, and therefore require an accumulation rate of about 100 μg cm− 2 Mn per year. Trace element analyses support the theory that vehicle emissions are responsible for most of the Mn supply. Lead, barium, and zinc correlate with manganese, indicating that tire material, brake pads, and resuspended road dust are likely to be the element sources. Microscopic investigations show no organisms on or in the Mn-rich crusts. In contrast, Mn-free black crusts sampled at greater heights (> 8 m) exhibited fungal and cyanobacterial encrustation. Carbon-rich spots were found by STXM-NEXAFS underneath one of the Mn-rich crusts. However, these carbon occurrences originate from soot and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) deposited on top of the crust, rather than from organisms responsible for the crust's formation, as shown by STXM-NEXAFS and Raman spectroscopic measurements. Our results suggest that the crusts develop abiogenically, with vehicle emissions as dominant element sources...|$|R

The investigation focuses {{on the effect of}} wheel speeds on material removal mechanisms and ground surface quality. With a wheel of grit size 160 mum, the effect of wheel speed on the ground surface quality was insignificant because brittle fracture was prevalent during grinding. When using a wheel of grit size 20 mum, the ground surfaces exhibited predominantly ductile flow and were significantly influenced by wheel speed. The maximum chip thickness was used to interpret the associated material removal mechanisms. It was also found that the spindle vibration caused by high wheel speeds could limit the improvement of surface quality. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the change in}} the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of five polymerised resin blends of increasing hydrophilicity, after ageing in distilled water or <b>silicon</b> oil. <b>Resin</b> blocks were prepared from each resin blend by dispensing the uncured resin into a flexible, embedding mould, containing multiple cavities. The resins were polymerised in the moulds under nitrogen at 551. 6 kPa and light-activated at 125 °C for 10 min. After dry ageing for 24 h at 37 °C, the middle third of each resin specimen was trimmed into an 'I' shape. Fifteen control specimens were randomly selected from each resin blend for baseline UTS evaluation. The UTS of the experimental specimens were determined after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months of ageing in water or oil. The UTS of each group of resins at different storage periods in water or oil were analysed using the Friedman multiple ANOVA on ranks and Dunn's multiple comparison tests at 95 % confidence level. Significant reduction (p 0. 05) in the same period. The percentage reduction in UTS increased with the hydrophilicity of the resin blends. Long-term water storage of hydrophilic resin blends such as those employed in dentine adhesives, resulted in a marked reduction in their mechanical strength that may compromise the durability of resin-dentine bonds. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
