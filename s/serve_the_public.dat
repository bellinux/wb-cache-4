5|$|In 1992, having {{arranged}} for a private investigation of Hendrix's death, Etchingham supplied {{the results of the}} effort to UK authorities and requested they reopen the coroner's inquest. After a several-month inquiry by Scotland Yard, during which every interested party to the events was interviewed, officials were confident the request would be granted. The investigation eventually proved inconclusive in 1993, when Attorney General Sir Nicholas Lyell decided that proceeding with the investigation would not <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> {{due in part to the}} excessive time that had passed since Hendrix's death.|$|E
5|$|The case {{established}} {{the doctrine of}} fair abridgement, which allowed that abridgements displaying {{a fair amount of}} labour {{on the part of the}} editor, and that differed from the original published work in a significant way, could not be copyright violations. This in effect raised the abridger to the level of an author. The decision did not define the exact parameters that would qualify a work as a valid abridgement. This distinction came with a later case involving an abridgement of Hawksworth's Voyages, in a decision written by Lord Chancellor Apsley. This concept of fair abridgement eventually evolved through common law, initiated from Gyles v Wilcox, into the current concept of fair use. Hardwicke's decision also added the exercise of personal judgement to the list of admissible defences against the charge of copyright infringement, adding to the growing case law establishing that British copyright would be based on labour and not on originality. The opinion advanced the position that copyright law should <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> interest by promoting the creation of new educational and useful works, rather than focusing on publishing rights. The case played a significant role in the development of English copyright law. The United States federal courts have cited the case as recently as the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|The augurs {{read the}} will of the gods and {{supervised}} the marking of boundaries as a reflection of universal order, thus sanctioning Roman expansionism as a matter of divine destiny. The Roman triumph was at its core a religious procession in which the victorious general displayed his piety and his willingness to <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> good by dedicating a portion of his spoils to the gods, especially Jupiter, who embodied just rule. As a result of the Punic Wars (264–146 BC), when Rome struggled to establish itself as a dominant power, many new temples were built by magistrates in fulfillment of a vow to a deity for assuring their military success.|$|E
25|$|Science {{policy is}} an area of public policy {{concerned}} with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including research funding, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>public.</b>|$|E
500|$|According to Parsons and Morris, {{the use of}} Wright's {{publications}} {{by later}} mathematicians is the [...] "greatest tribute to his life's work". Wright's work was relied on by Dutch astronomer and mathematician Willebrord Snellius, noted for the law of refraction now known as Snell's law, for his navigation treatise Tiphys Batavus (Batavian Tiphys, 1624); and by Adriaan Metius, the geometer and astronomer from Holland, for Primum Mobile (1631). Following Wright's proposals, Richard Norwood measured a degree on a great circle of the earth at , publishing the information in 1637. Wright was praised by Charles Saltonstall in The Navigator (1642) and by John Collins in Navigation by the Mariners Plain Scale New Plain'd (1659), Collins stating that Mercator's chart ought [...] "more properly to be called Wright's chart". The Caius annals contained the following epitaph: [...] "Of him it may truly be said, that he studied more to <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> than himself".|$|E

500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1878, {{at the age of}} 20, Emmeline Goulden met and began a {{courtship}} with Richard Pankhurst, a barrister who had advocated women's suffrage – and other causes, including freedom of speech and education reform – for years. Richard, 44 years old when they met, had earlier resolved to remain a bachelor to better <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>public.</b> Their mutual affection was powerful, but the couple's happiness was diminished by the death of his mother the following year. Sophia Jane Goulden chastised her daughter for [...] "throwing herself" [...] at Richard and urged her without success to exhibit more aloofness. Emmeline suggested to Richard that they avoid the legal formalities of marriage by entering into a free union; he objected on the grounds that she would be excluded from political life as an unmarried woman. He noted that his colleague Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy had faced social condemnation before she formalised her marriage to Ben Elmy. Emmeline Goulden agreed, and they were wed in St Luke's Church, Pendleton on 18 December 1879.|$|E
500|$|On March 12, 2014, the FCC Media Bureau {{released}} a notice {{that it would}} further analyze television station transactions that include sharing agreements, particularly those that include a purchase option that [...] "may counter any incentive the licensee has to increase {{the value of the}} station, since the licensee may be unlikely to realize that increased value." [...] Under the new provisions, broadcasters must demonstrate in their transaction applications as to how such deals would <b>serve</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> interest. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) – which, along with station groups such as Sinclair Broadcast Group, have disapproved of the proposal to ban JSAs – presented a compromise proposal, in which the brokered licensee in a sharing agreement would retain control over at least 85 percent of the station's programming, maintain at least 70 percent of ad sales revenue and [...] "maintain at least 20 percent of station value in the license itself". FCC commissioner Ajit Pai, and Gordon Smith, president of the NAB, were also opposed to the new rules on joint sales agreements, believing that they would discourage the ownership of television stations by minority-owned companies. Tom Wheeler, however, proposed the restrictions in the hopes of encouraging more women and minorities to own stations, due to the ongoing consolidation in the television industry through company mergers and sharing agreements.|$|E
