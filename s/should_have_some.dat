Therefore, on 28 February 1714, he issued a decree calling for compulsory education, which dictated that all Russian 10- to 15-year-old children of the nobility, government clerks, and lesser-ranked officials, must learn basic mathematics and geometry, and should be tested on it {{at the end of their}} studies.|$|E

The judge ruled that Hinckley could have up to three visits of three nights and then four visits of four nights, each depending on the successful completion of the last. All of the experts who testified at Hinckley's 2005 conditional release hearing, including the government experts, agreed that his depression and psychotic disorder were in full remission and that he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> expanded conditions of release.|$|E

The scribe <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> knowledge of dressage terminology, be smartly dressed and have legible handwriting.

From the academic year 2005/2006 onwards, access rules have enforced minimum grades of 95 (out of 200) in the national access examinations for all candidates in every sector of public higher education. In practical terms, and unlike what happened in the past, the new rule meant the exclusion {{of a large number of}} applicants who otherwise would have been admitted with negative grades to the less selective courses of some public institutions, and consequently lead to a number of available places for students left vacant every year in many courses.|$|E
25|$|The Common Pursuit, another {{collection}} of his essays from Scrutiny, {{was published in}} 1952. Outside of his work on English poetry and the novel, this is Leavisâ€™s best-known and most influential work. A decade later Leavis was to earn much notoriety when he delivered his Richmond lecture, Two Cultures? The Significance of C. P. Snow at Downing College. Leavis vigorously attacked Snow's suggestion, from a 1959 lecture and book by C. P. Snow (see The Two Cultures), that practitioners of the scientific and humanistic disciplines <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> significant understanding of each other, and {{that a lack of}} knowledge of twentieth-century physics was comparable to an ignorance of Shakespeare. Leavis's ad hominem attacks on Snow's intelligence and abilities were widely decried in the British press by public figures such as Lord Boothby and Lionel Trilling.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Gemini 10, Collins was {{assigned}} to the backup crew for the second manned Apollo flight, with Commander Frank Borman, Command Module Pilot (CMP) Thomas Stafford and Collins as Lunar Module Pilot (LMP). Along with learning the new Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) and the Apollo Lunar Module (LM), Collins received helicopter training, as these were thought to {{be the best way to}} simulate the landing approach of the LM. After the completion of Project Gemini, it was decided to cancel the Apollo 2 flight, since it would just repeat the Apollo 1 flight. In the process of crews being reassigned, Collins was moved to the CMP position on the Apollo 8 prime crew, since his new crew was Borman, Collins and William Anders. Deke Slayton had decided that the CMP <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> spaceflight experience, something that Anders did not have. Three years later, this change would be the reason Collins orbited the Moon while Armstrong and Aldrin walked on its surface.|$|E

500|$|On February 2, 2015, Paul {{generated}} controversy {{by suggesting}} that states should not require parents to vaccinate their children, because parents should {{have the freedom to}} make that decision for their children. In an interview with CNBC on February 2, Paul clarified this statement, commenting [...] "I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea. I think they are a good thing, but I think the parent <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> input. The state doesn't own your children. Parents own the children, and it is an issue of freedom."

500|$|With {{help from}} Mimi and Lennon's headmaster, Lennon was {{accepted}} into the Liverpool College of Art because his aunt insisted that he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> sort of academic qualifications, even though Lennon was beginning to show an interest in music. She opposed the idea of him forming a band and disapproved of McCartney because he was, [...] "working class", calling him [...] "John's little friend". When she later met Harrison, she [...] "hated him" [...] because of his thick Liverpudlian accent and Teddy Boy clothes. Lennon and McCartney often met at Mendips to write songs, and rehearsed in the glass-panelled porch {{at the front of}} the house, which was the only place they were allowed to play. She once asked Parkes to take her to The Cavern to see Lennon and the Beatles play, but when she descended into the damp, dark cellar; full of screaming teenagers, she shouted to Parkes, [...] "Get him [...] out, get him out! Tell him to come off the stage! He can't stay here.... We'll have to stop this!" [...] The band's first residency in Hamburg exasperated her because she wanted Lennon to continue his studies, but he placated her by greatly exaggerating the sum of money he would earn.|$|E

[...] He wrote in The Guardian: [...] "By gathering this level of support Jeremy Corbyn has already shown that there is a strong nascent progressive movement in this country. He's shown the others in his party that there's a well of commitment for them to tap, if they have the will and the courage to do it. If nothing further happens with his campaign, that would be an undeniable and valuable contribution. I admit it: PM Corbyn is a long shot right now â€“ but only four weeks ago bookies were giving 100-1 against him even becoming the candidate. Now it's 7-4 on. Things can change, and quickly.

Vanessa then claims that Jerry only took her to Vermont because he lost so much money. Back in New York, George is celebrating the rising price of his stock, which has increased by $8,000.

2500|$|The Silver Surfer debuted as an {{unplanned}} {{addition to}} the superhero-team comic Fantastic Four #48 (March 1966). The comic's writer-editor, Stan Lee, and its penciller and co-plotter, Jack Kirby, had, by the mid-1960s, developed a collaborative technique known as the [...] "Marvel Method": the two would discuss story ideas, Kirby working from a brief synopsis to draw the individual scenes and plot details, with Lee finally adding the dialogue and captions. When Kirby turned in his pencil art for the story, he included a new character he and Lee had not discussed. [...] As Lee recalled in 1995, [...] "There, {{in the middle of}} the story we had so carefully worked out, was a nut on some sort of flying surfboard". He later expanded on this, recalling, [...] "I thought, 'Jack, this time you've gone too far'". Kirby explained that the story's agreed-upon antagonist, a god-like cosmic predator of planets named Galactus, <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> sort of herald, and that he created the surfboard [...] "because I'm tired of drawing spaceships!" [...] Taken by the noble features of the new character, who turned on his master to help defend Earth, Lee overcame his initial skepticism and began adding characterization. The Silver Surfer soon became a key part of the unfolding story.|$|E
2500|$|President Barack Obama {{signed the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) into law on March 23, 2010 in the East Room before a select {{audience}} of nearly 300.

[...] The primary purpose of the PPACA was to increase coverage to the American people either through public or private insurance and control healthcare costs. [...] The Congressional Budget Office(CBO) estimated that the PPACA would reduce the number of uninsured by 32 million increasing coverage for the non-elderly citizens from 83 to 94 per cent. [...] Insurers were not allowed to deny insurance to applicants with pre-existing conditions. [...] The Sunlight Foundation has stated that at least forty-seven private company contractors have been involved with the PPACA in some capacity as of fall 2013, with the measure causing a wide variety of policy changes. Journalists writing for The New York Times have called the PPACA [...] "the most expansive social legislation enacted in decades".|$|E
2500|$|Hebert {{claims that}} postmodernist {{discourse}} no longer offers an adequate explanation for contemporary musical practices. Rather, he advocates a global-historical perspective: that humanity has recently exited {{a period of}} [...] "digital prehistory" [...] to enter a phase of [...] "data saturation" [...] through ubiquitous mass surveillance, causing conditions he describes as [...] "glocalimbodied," [...] meaning that local and global forces converge to [...] "stamp" [...] the identities of individual actors suspended within a social structure shaped by participatory media. In his view, this context results in music creation and consumption increasingly transcending earlier connections to space and time, engendering both a blurring and reactionary institutionalization of local genres and historical styles. Consequently, Hebert contends that music education policies and practices should be re-envisioned to emphasize individual originality and empowerment via a musicianship of [...] "flexibility", with inclusion of marginalized traditions and rejection of any ties to [...] "aesthetic fundamentalism", techno-utopianism, militarism and nationalism. Music scholars have noted that Hebert [...] "believes music education will become more relevant and effective when it attends more completely to 'creative agency via technology and musical hybridity'," [...] and that [...] "Music learned in school <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> connection to the music the student engages with outside of school and that musicianship should be understood as an â€˜embodied practice situated in sociocultural contextsâ€™." [...] An advocate for increased contemporary music, music technology, and popular music in schools, Hebert nevertheless warns that these should {{not be seen as}} panacea for poor teaching or inadequate funding and facilities, and that historical traditions â€“ including the heritage of [...] "classical" [...] art music â€“ still legitimately require ample space in school education. Hebert's work especially promotes the value of internationalization in teacher education, and emphasizes the importance of an international-comparative perspective for envisioning improvements to educational policies and practices.|$|E
