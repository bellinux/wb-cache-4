500|$|In Interstellar, Nolan {{explored}} {{the laws of}} physics as represented in Einstein's theory of general relativity, identifying time as the film's antagonist. Reality is often an abstract and fragile concept in Nolan's work. Alec Price and M. Dawson of Left Field Cinema noted that the existential crisis of conflicted male figures [...] "struggling with the slippery nature of identity" [...] is a prevalent theme in Nolan's work. The actual (or objective) world is of less importance than {{the way in which we}} absorb and remember, and it is this created (or subjective) reality that truly matters. [...] "It is solely in the mind and the heart where any sense of permanency or equilibrium can ever be found." [...] According to film theorist Todd McGowan, these [...] "created realities" [...] also reveal the ethical and political importance of creating fictions and falsehoods. Nolan's films typically deceive spectators about the events that occur and the motivations of the characters, but they do not abandon the idea of truth altogether. Instead, [...] "They <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> truth must emerge out of the lie if it is not to lead us entirely astray." [...] McGowan further argues that Nolan is the first filmmaker to devote himself entirely to the illusion of the medium, calling him a Hegelian filmmaker. He has also noted that retroactive causality populates many of Nolan's films.|$|E

From a Tantric perspective, Biernacki’s piece <b>shows</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> a nuanced understanding of the imagination {{can be used in}} contemplative practice to help us remedy the disintegrated, mechanistic world produced by the Cartesian mind-body split.
