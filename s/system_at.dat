30|$|Dorigo and Schnepf (1993) {{present an}} {{approach}} for developing behavior-based robots using multiple classifier systems {{running in parallel}} in a hierarchical structure. Each classifier system learns simple behaviors through interactions with the environment. The hierarchical organization distinguishes two learning activities, one for learning behavioral sequences and another for learning coordination sequences. Classifier <b>systems</b> <b>at</b> the lowest level in the hierarchy learn behavioral sequences which are real actions activated by sensory input from the environment. Only the classifier <b>systems</b> <b>at</b> the lowest level have {{direct access to the}} environment via the sensors and actuators of the robot. On the other hand, classifier <b>systems</b> <b>at</b> a higher level learn to coordinate the activities of classifier <b>systems</b> <b>at</b> lower levels. Their work is modular, allowing more classifier components to be added to learn more behaviors. However, that is at the expense of increased resource consumption.|$|R

5|$|A spherical shell Dyson sphere in the Solar System with a {{radius of}} one astronomical unit, {{so that the}} {{interior}} surface would receive {{the same amount of}} sunlight as Earth does per unit solid angle, would have a surface area of approximately , or about 550 million times the surface area of Earth. This would intercept the full 384.6 yottawatts (3.846 × 1026 watts) of the Sun's output. Non-shell designs would intercept less, but the shell variant represents the maximum possible energy captured for the Solar <b>System</b> <b>at</b> this point of the Sun's evolution. This is approximately 33 trillion times the power consumption of humanity in 1998, which was 12 terawatts.|$|E
5|$|After the 5.5 Richter Scale {{magnitude}} 1968 Illinois earthquake, scientists {{realized that}} there was a previously unknown fault under Saline County, just north of Eldorado, Illinois near Harrisburg.

The fault is connected to the north–south trending Wabash Valley Fault <b>System</b> <b>at</b> its eastern end. Seismographic mapping completed by geologists reveal that monoclines, anticlines, and synclines are present within the region; these signs suggest deformation during the Paleozoic era coincident to strike-slip faulting nearby.|$|E

5|$|AirTrain JFK is free {{within the}} {{terminal}} area {{and to the}} hotel and car rental shuttle buses at Federal Circle.

Transferring to the Q3, Q10, or B15 from Terminal 5 requires an extra $2.75 fare, since the MTA does not offer free transfers from the AirTrain. Consequently, entering the subway at either Jamaica or Howard Beach costs $7.75, and entering the LIRR at Jamaica costs $14.25 during peak hours and $9 during off-peak with the LIRR CityTicket.|$|E
