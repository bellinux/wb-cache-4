40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{estimate}} {{the value of the}} water supply system Mrzlek {{on the basis of the}} Cadastre of public infrastructure. The analysis of the key factors that affect the value of public infrastructure was conducted in general, as well as a comparison of data from the Cadastre and management cadastre. Based on the statistical analysis it is identified, in which period the majority network was built, which water pipe material is most commonly used and which pipe sizes are the most frequent within the water supply system. The water supply system Mrzlek was classified in various network types according to the size of the <b>serviced</b> <b>area</b> as well. By comparing the data from both cadastres differences in the data were identified, especially in the data management and content of the data. In the conclusion the current value of the water supply system Mrzlek was assessed on the basis of a simplified model...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of Early Start, an early intervention program for teenage parents with newborn babies, was evaluated. The program {{was designed to}} reach teenage parents in a rural Maine area. Some teenagers attended classes with their babies. Others received individualized service at home. Programming focussed on teaching parents about infant behavior and development. Considerable time was spent coaching parents in play with their babies by using guided interaction and videotaping. Baseline and post-test data measuring maternal, support, and interaction variables were collected on both Early Start participants and a matched control group from outside of the <b>serviced</b> <b>area.</b> A preliminary {{analysis of the data}} showed some beneficial, short-term effects for Early Start, mother-infant pairs. Specifically, mothers who participated in the Early Start Program reported less 2 ̆ 2 unpredictability 2 ̆ 2 in their babies and fewer family worries than did their control counterparts. Early Start mothers also had more realistic developmental expectations and more desirable childrearing attitudes. ...|$|E
40|$|Potable water {{distribution}} systems (WDS) require upgrade strategies {{based on a}} pre-defined time interval which is identified by the responsible water authorities. The main goal of a potable water system upgrade is maintaining the standard and acceptable level of service after the occurrence of increases in the serviced population, asset ageing, and/or development of the <b>serviced</b> <b>area.</b> Defining the level of service varies by location according to the codes and regulations adopted by the water authority. In general, two main factors are notable in planning of WDS upgrade strategies: (1) the 'Level of Service' and (2) the 'Upgrade Cost'. In the presented paper a new index has been introduced to evaluate the level of service for WDS from pressure point of view. The new index that is {{presented in this paper}} is named the 'Pressure Index (PI) ', and incorporates a number of water connections for five different pressure regimes. As a case study three existing water network systems in the Castlemaine township area, located in central Victoria, Australia, have been investigated and the relationship between the 'Upgrade Costs' and improvement in PI factors is presented...|$|E

40|$|Several {{statutory}} restrictions {{have recently}} been lifted {{on the use of}} Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) in South Africa. Previously, VoIP could only be utilised by the incumbent telecommunications operator, Telkom, the Second National Operator (SNO) and under <b>serviced</b> <b>area</b> licensees (USALs). This means new opportunities and cost savings for both network service providers and consumers. However, in rural and remote regions, further liberalisation is required so that service providers can take advantage of wireless technologies to provide connectivity in these areas. This paper discusses the legislative environment in South Africa and around the world with respect to VoIP and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi). In addition, examples are provided of how these technologies have been combined to provide last mile solutions around the world and particularly in South Africa. The paper concludes that further liberalisation in the telecommunications environment in South Africa is required if the goal of providing affordable access in rural areas is to be attained. Specifically, it is recommended that wireless technologies be deregulated since the combination of VoIP and WiFi may benefit rural areas. Also, the paper finds that USALs may not be the right model for underserviced areas in South Africa. Lastly, it is apparent that applications drive development and dictate which technologies are relevant for rural areas. VoIP WiFi South Africa...|$|E
40|$|Potable Water Distribution Systems (WDS) need {{augmentation}} strategies {{based on}} a determined and pre-defined time intervals. The main aim of potable water systems augmentation is maintaining the standard and acceptable level of service after occurrences of increase in design serviced population, asset ageing and/or <b>serviced</b> <b>area.</b> It is obvious that systems augmentations require significant amount of budget allocation, which is the main constraint for the water authorities {{for the implementation of}} any augmentation plan. In general, two main factors are playing roles in planning of WDS augmentation strategies; namely, the parameter of 'Level of Service' on one hand and the factor of 'Augmentation Cost' on the other. The main goal of a proper planning in a WDS is the prediction of a system's water demand in future and suggestion of an appropriate and efficient solution for the predicted demand. Till now, no research has been conducted to establish a relationship between 'Level of Service' and 'Augmentation Cost'. In this paper, a new index is introduced to measure the level of service of a water distribution system from its pressures point of view. Since there is no existing factor for the rating of a water network from its pressures point of view, a new factor named 'Pressure Index (PI) ' incorporating number of pipe nodes for five different pressure regimes is defined. The PI factor is expected to show improvement after a WDS augmentation which is the indicator of that WDS pressures improvement and therefore the effectiveness of proposed planning scheme. As a case study, three existing water network systems in Castlemaine area near central Victoria is investigated and relationship with the augmentation costs and PI factors is presented...|$|E
40|$|Planning and {{hydraulic}} modelling {{phase in}} Water Distribution Systems (WDS) are playing an enormous role for water authorities. Making wise decisions in planning phase will ease the future recurrent budget for Capital Expenditures (Capex) and Operating Expense (Opex) to guarantee achieving the acceptable {{quality of service}} in WDS encountering population growth and land developments. The conventional methodology for planning of WDS includes the population growth impact assessment on the system and then proposing new assets {{to comply with the}} local water distribution code. Potable water networks need asset planning, augmentation strategies and rehabilitation schemes in consistence with the new assigned loads to them. Planning strategies are usually based on sophisticated hydraulic models and a determined and pre-defined time intervals to maintain the level of service after occurrences of increase in design serviced population, asset ageing and/or <b>serviced</b> <b>area.</b> Systems rehabilitation studies require significant amount of budget which is the main constraint for the water authorities for the implementation of any augmentation plan. Two main factors are playing roles in WDS asset planning strategies. The first parameter is the acceptable Level of Service and the second factor is the 'Associated Cost' of the asset planning. The main goal of a proper planning in a WDS is the prediction of a system's behavior in future and suggestion of efficient set of solutions for the predicted demand. The most critical criteria to be addressed and augmented in a typical urban WDS are water pressures and water velocities. Water pressure is the first tangible measure that customers feel and the water velocity has impact on energy loss in the system which is an indicator of applied shear stress from water to inner side of the pipes. The water pressure and the water velocity are two main hydraulic factors which are affected by population growth and therefore capital expenditure needed to rectify them. Authors earlier introduced a Pressure Index (PI) for WDS and studied the relationship between PI improvements and augmentation costs per connection. Authors' earlier publication considered the modification and improvement of pressures in the water systems. In the current paper, development and calibration of further hydraulic models (using Innovyze InfoWorks WS model) for water systems are presented. In addition to the introduced PI factors, in this paper a new index (Velocity Index, VI) is introduced for the assessment of WDS from the water velocity point of view. Relationships between improvements of Level of Service (considering VI) and 'Associated Cost' in WDS are presented...|$|E

40|$|The <b>service</b> <b>areas</b> for {{electric}} power substations {{can be estimated}} using a Cellular Automata (CA) model. The CA model is a discrete, iterative process whereby substations acquire <b>service</b> <b>area</b> by claiming neighboring cells. The <b>service</b> <b>area</b> expands from a substation until a neighboring substation <b>service</b> <b>area</b> is met or the substation`s total capacity or other constraints are reached.

The rule set is based on a hierarchy of quantitative metrics that represent real-world factors such as land use and population density. Together, the metrics determine the rate of cell acquisition and the upper bound for <b>service</b> <b>area</b> size. Assessing the CA-model accuracy requires comparisons to actual <b>service</b> <b>areas.</b> These actual <b>service</b> <b>areas</b> can be extracted from distribution maps. Quantitative assessment of the CA-model accuracy can be accomplished by a number of methods.
