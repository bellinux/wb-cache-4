50|$|More highly jeweled watches add jewels {{to other}} pivots, {{starting}} with the pallet fork, then the escape wheel, fourth wheel, third wheel, then finally the center <b>wheel.</b> <b>Jeweling</b> like this to the third <b>wheel</b> adds eight <b>jewels,</b> giving 15 jewels in total. Jeweling to the center wheel adds two more giving 17 jewels in total. Thus, a 17 jewel watch {{is considered to be}} fully jeweled.|$|R

50|$|Additional jewels beyond 17 {{are used}} to either add cap jewels, or to jewel the {{mainspring}} barrel of the watch. Watches with 19 jewels, particularly those made by Elgin and Waltham, will often have a jeweled mainspring barrel. Alternatively a 19 jewel watch will have additional cap jewels on the escape <b>wheel.</b> 21 <b>jewel</b> watches commonly have cap jewels on both the pallet fork and escape <b>wheel.</b> 23 <b>jewel</b> watches will have a jeweled barrel and fully capped escapement. The timekeeping value of jewels beyond 17 for a time-only movement is often debated.|$|R

50|$|Center or <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> - {{which turns}} once per hour. Its pinion is turned by the teeth on the {{mainspring}} barrel in watches and spring driven clocks, {{and by the}} weight pulley in weight driven clocks. Its arbor projects {{through a hole in}} the face and drives, via a friction coupling, the cannon pinion, which carries the minute hand. It also drives the pinion of the third wheel. In wrist watches with centre seconds, that is with the seconds hand pivoted coaxially with the minute and hour hands, this wheel is positioned off centre to allow the fourth wheel to be placed at the centre of the movement. In this arrangement the wheel is called the <b>second</b> <b>wheel,</b> because it is still the <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> in the train but no longer at the centre of the movement.|$|R

5000|$|The calibre {{was quickly}} adopted {{throughout}} France and today its basic design is what characterizes all mechanical watches. It {{is important to}} note that the term [...] "Lépine" [...] can refer to both the calibre itself or a type of pocket watch with a flat, open-faced case in which the <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> is placed in the axis of the winder shaft and the crown positioned at XII, in opposition to the savonete (or hunter-case) watch where the <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> and winder shaft are placed on perpendicular axes and the crown at III.

5|$|Virginia's second Convention of 1861 was a Unionist {{response}} to the secessionist movement in Virginia. The First Wheeling Convention meeting at Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia), sat on May 13–15. It called for elections to another meeting if Virginia's Ordinance of Secession were to pass referendum. After the vote was taken on May 23, the First Session of the <b>Second</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Convention met from June 11 June 25 to establish the Restored Government of Virginia, electing Arthur I.

50|$|The ride {{comprised}} a 116-foot cross beam, {{each end}} carrying a 12-arm wheel, with a circular eight-passenger cabin suspended {{from each of}} the wheel arms. One end of the cross beam would rise approximately one hundred feet as its wheel spun in a clockwise motion. The cabins could also be spun in the horizontal plane using a central steering wheel, similar to a teacup ride. After being up in the air for several minutes, and after the <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> was loaded, the first wheel was lowered to the ground and the <b>second</b> <b>wheel</b> raised in the air. When shut down, the cross beam would rest at , both wheels dangling 40-to-50 feet off the ground.|$|R

25|$|Unionist {{sentiment}} {{was so high}} in {{the northwestern}} counties that civil government began to disintegrate, and the Wheeling Intelligencer newspaper called for a convention of delegates {{to meet in the}} city of Wheeling to consider secession from the commonwealth of Virginia. Delegates duly assembled, and at the First Wheeling Convention (also known as the May Convention), held May 13 to 15, the delegates voted to hold off on secession from Virginia until Virginia formally seceded from the United States. Concerned that the irregular nature of the First Wheeling Convention might not democratically represent the will of the people, elections were scheduled for June 4 to formally elect delegates to a second convention, if necessary. Virginians voted to approve secession on May 23. On June 4, elections were held and delegates to a <b>Second</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Convention elected. These elections were irregular as well: Some were held under military pressure, some counties sent no delegates, some delegates never appeared, and voter turnout varied significantly. On June 19, the <b>Second</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Convention declared the offices of all government officials who had voted for secession vacant, and reconstituted the executive and legislative branches of the Virginia government from their own ranks. The <b>Second</b> <b>Wheeling</b> Convention adjourned on June 25 with the intent of reconvening on August 6.|$|R
