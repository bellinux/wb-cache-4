50|$|The {{series has}} four main {{professional}} classes: Top Fuel Dragster, Funny Car, Pro Stock, and Pro Stock Motorcycle. Top Fuel was the first category, with Funny Cars added in 1966, Pro Stock four years later and Pro Stock Motorcycles in 1987. Both Top Fuel and Funny Cars regularly see top speeds in excess of 300 mph today, and one thousand foot times anywhere from 3.70 to 4 seconds. Both these cars burn fuel consisting of 90% nitromethane and 10% methanol. The Pro <b>Stock</b> <b>record</b> is 214 mph, with times often in the 6.4-6.7 second range and the Pro Stock Motorcycles usually run at 190+ mph (190 mph), with times in the low 7- to high 6-second range. Top Fuel (class designation: AA/D top fuel dragster) and Fuel Funny Car (class designation: AA/FC top fuel coupe) have recently been limited to a 1000 ft track, instead of the historic 1/4 mile 1320 ft, {{as a means to}} limit top speeds and increase safety (there had been a number of engine explosions at or near 300 mph resulting in driver injuries and death). Currently, driver and spectator safety has been enhanced even while top speeds often approach and exceed 300 mph.|$|E

40|$|An {{inventory}} <b>stock</b> <b>record</b> is {{in error}} when the <b>stock</b> <b>record</b> {{is not in}} agreement with the physical stock. Such discrepancies may be introduced due to time lags between flow of information and material, pilferage, incorrect unit of issue, inaccurate physical inventory counts, etc. The primary impact of these errors is that the system fails to order when it should, resulting in "warehouse denials," i. e., the stock records show a balance sufficient to issue a given material release order, but for which insufficient units of stock can physically be found. The object {{of this paper is to}} select the proper frequency and depth of inventory counts, together with modifications to a given stocking policy, so as to minimize the total cost per unit time, subject to the likelihood of a warehouse denial between inventory counts being below a prescribed level. The goal has been to obtain results easily implementable and leads to formulae comparable to those of the classical economic lot-size models.

40|$|The article {{suggests}} {{some changes}} in (the functioning of the service market in Poland. The subjects under consideration are maintenance, repairing and personal services from the aspect of planning and management, prices, wages, and ways of supply. It is suggested that planning and management should belong to {{the activities of the}} people's councils. The district people's councils might work out medium-range plans, where the investment plan {{would be one of the}} elements. This could become the basis to work out yearly assignments for single service enterprises. As it appears synthetic measures supplemented with natural ones may be most adequate because they control the correct trends of their activities. As regards prices the author suggests that (the number of services centrally controlled should be limited and prices should be seasonally changed to be adjusted to the fluctuation of demand. He proposes a formula depending on counting in profil, turnover tax and overhead costs according to the interest on fixed and working assets of the enterprise to direct costs (particularly wages). To secure quantitative and qualitative development of services it is necessary to employ such a system of wages that the earnings of skilled service workers may be as those in the other branches of then national economy or even higher. As regards the supply a general reform in the national economy is needed. A antralization of the <b>stock</b> <b>record</b> of the spare parts is necessary for a proper management. The author suggests that a bonus fund should be built out of the profits to increase an influence upon the extend and direction of economic activities of service enterprises. To make the enterprises take a greater interest in services rendered to the population the rate of turnover tax paid on those activities to the budget should be reduced.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the factors {{influencing}} inventory control in Population Services International Ethiopia. The various factor influencing inventory control were broken into bureaucratic procurement procedure, carrying cost,stock audit practice,stock record practice and staff skill & experience. The particular objective that were analyzed include; evaluation of the effects of procurement procedure to the effectiveness of inventory control, examination of the effect of high inventory carrying cost to the effectiveness of inventory control, determination of the effects of stock audit practices to the effectiveness of Inventory control, analysis of the effects of poor <b>stock</b> <b>record</b> practice to effectiveness of inventory control, and examination of the effects of staff skill & experience to the effectiveness of inventory control. The research adopted descriptive study design. A stratified random sampling technique was applied to the study. The researcher used a sample size of 30 % of the target population to act as the sample size. The researcher used questionnaire to collect data for the research. The questionnaire contained open and closed ended questions and five point Likert scale questions and covered areas of inventory control to come up with good raw data for the research. The collected data were quantitatively analyzed using statistical methods such as SPSS which was commanded to produce frequency tables, graphs and pie charts for effective interpretation. The key findings from the study revealed that: delays in procurement of goods, frequent stock-outs and no use of mathematical model were some of the effects of long bureaucratic procurement procedure. According to the study, some products were over stocked, expired, damage and obsolete that eventually increase carrying cost were some of the effects in inventory control. The study revealed that lack of specific time or date for stock taking exercise and discrepancies between actual and physical stock balances were some of the effects of stock audit practice. The study also revealed that unavailability of fully computerized system all over the organization, lack of specific time or date for posting stock records, lack of adequately trained staff hinders effective performance of the organization. The researcher recommends that cumbersome rules and reliance on rigid rules and policies that slow down procurement process should be avoided; current inventory control practices and procedures need to be reviewed and redesigned. The management should stay up-to-date on inventory carrying cost. Only qualified and adequately trained personnel should be involved in stock control...|$|E
