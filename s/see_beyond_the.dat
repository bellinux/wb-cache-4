25|$|Miss Representation is a {{documentary}} by Jennifer Siebel Newsom, exploring and displaying {{the role that}} mainstream media plays in society today with regards to women and the under-representation of women in influential positions. Prominent women in today's society were featured in discussing how the media has impacted their life along with their views on how the media is impacting {{the lives of people}} from an early age. These media messages have a severe impact on how individuals carry themselves along with what aspects bog them down like insecurities with body image. This film encourages viewers to start to <b>see</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> message and not compare themselves to these picture perfect computer-generated images.|$|E
500|$|According to Gravett {{and fellow}} {{military}} enthusiast Trevor James Halsall, Somerset's decision {{to engage the}} Yorkist army on this plateau was sound. Defending the ground just before Towton would block any enemy advance towards the city of York, whether they moved along the LondonTowton road or an old Roman road to the west. The Lancastrians deployed {{on the north side}} of the dale, using the valley as a [...] "protective ditch"; the disadvantage of this position was that they could not <b>see</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> southern ridge of the dale. [...] The Lancastrian flanks were protected by marshes; their right was further secured by the steep banks of the Cock Beck. The width of their deployment area did not allow for a longer front line, depriving the Lancastrians of the opportunity to use their numerical superiority. [...] Waurin's account gave rise to the suggestion that Somerset ordered a force of mounted spearmen to conceal itself in Castle Hill Wood, ready to charge into the Yorkist left flank at an opportune time in battle.|$|E
500|$|According to Religion News Service writer Steve Rabey, [...] "Within You Without You" [...] "contrast Western individualism with Eastern monism". The lyrics convey basic {{tenets of}} Vedanta philosophy, {{particularly}} in Harrison's {{reference to the}} concept of maya (the illusory nature of existence), in the lines [...] "And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion / Never glimpse the truth". Author Joshua Greene paraphrases the song-wide message as: [...] "A wall of illusion separates us from each other … which only turns our love for one another cold. Peace will come when we learn to see past the illusion of differences and come to know that we are one …" [...] The solution espoused by Harrison is for individuals to <b>see</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> self and each seek change within, further to Vivekananda's contention in Raja Yoga that [...] "Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest that divinity …" [...] According to ethnomusicologist David Reck, aside from the reference to maya, the lyrics convey Indian philosophical concepts such as advait (the one essential reality), satya (perception of truth) and, in the line [...] "With our love we could save the world", universal love.|$|E

500|$|In {{describing}} {{the premise of}} the novel, Le Guin stated [...] "the hero of the book, the protagonist, he has a different gift, it isn’t magic at all, in fact, it’s another kind of talent. And his problem is to realize that he doesn’t have the kind he’s supposed to have, he has this other one. Which is a problem, actually, {{a lot of young people}} face: What is my gift?" [...] Reviewers have described Orrec's search for his own identity, in contrast to the identity that has been thrust upon him, as one of the major themes of the novel. This theme is related to the other major theme of the novel, that of power and responsibility. As he comes to terms with his identity, Orrec questions whether he is betraying his power by refusing to try to use it. Gry, too, is unwilling to use her gift to call animals to be hunted, and wonders whether [...] "all the gifts are backward.... They could have been healing, to begin with." [...] The novel ends with the two protagonists realizing that they are unwilling to remain in the cycle of violence and retribution in the Uplands, and leaving to keep their integrity; but they are also running toward a place where they can use their gifts as they please, rather than simply running away. A part of Orrec and Gry's process of growing up is to <b>see</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> binary choices they are presented with by society. Orrec is faced with a choice of whether to use his power, or to be blindfolded; Gry has to use her power to hunt, or not. Gry realizes that all of the upland powers can be used in two ways: for control and dominion, or for healing and nurturing. This recognition allows them to take a third choice, and leave. This wrestling with choice has been compared to the choices the characters are forced to make in Le Guin's novella The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas.|$|E

Although the last scattering surface is not at any fixed comoving coordinate, the current recession velocity of the points from which the CMB was emitted is 3.2c. At the time of emission their speed was 58.1c, assuming (ΩM,ΩΛ) = (0.3,0.7). Thus we routinely observe objects that are receding faster than the speed of light and the Hubble sphere is not a horizon." ...|$|E

This alternate group played nightclub engagements and was an artistic success, but the paying public preferred the City Slickers and stayed away. Jones wound up paying some of the band's expenses out of his own pocket. Some of the City Slickers band members appeared and recorded with the Other Orchestra, but most of the Other Orchestra personnel consisted of [...] "serious," [...] accomplished studio musicians from the Los Angeles area.|$|E
2500|$|Though Borg costumes are all unique, {{they share}} several common characteristics. Borg {{commonly}} have one eye (most often the left eye) {{replaced with a}} sophisticated ocular implant which allows them to <b>see</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> human visual spectrum, though it {{may not always be}} added to them. This implant usually projects a red laser beam, particularly in later appearances. They also usually have one arm replaced with a prosthetic one, bearing one of a variety of multipurpose tools in place of a humanoid hand. Since different drones have slightly different roles, the arm may be specialized for medical purposes, or weaponized for tactical usage. Another defining feature is flat white skin, giving them an almost zombie-like appearance. This skin was originally dry and human-looking, but it later had a more [...] "slick" [...] look to it, with veins showing.|$|E

2500|$|As Díaz saw it, Indians impeded progress. It was {{not worth}} it to invest {{time and money to}} bring Indians out of their {{intellectual}} darkness and into a modern society through education. Díaz did not think Indians were biologically inferior to Europeans, but felt that centuries of subjugation had psychologically inhibited their ability to modernize. As mentioned in Creelman’s interview, Díaz claimed that Indians did not care to succeed because they could not <b>see</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> scope of a daily life. Indians needed a ruler to dictate their lives. However, this paternalistic approach to the Indian questioned turned from an issue of social welfare {{at the beginning of his}} presidency to one of indifference, so long as the economy kept progressing. On this point, Limantour and other científicos, played a great part because they “helped to alienate Díaz from the native peoples and this resulted in a growing indifference on the President’s part toward a wide sector of the population.” ...|$|E

The German front had several shallow salients, flanks, a bastion at {{the west end of}} Y Ravine and cover in the valleys to the east. Beaumont-Hamel {{commanded}} the valley, which the VIII Corps divisions were to cross and had been fortified. Beaucourt Ridge further back, gave a commanding view to German artillery observers, who could see the gun flashes of British field artillery, despite the guns being dug in. British observers could not <b>see</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> German support trenches and the convex slope on the British side of no man's land, made it difficult for heavy artillery to hit the front position, parts of which was untouched by the preliminary bombardment.|$|E
2500|$|There Buechner {{realized}} {{the challenge of}} writing without the structure of school life around him. He describes the creation of his next novel, The Entrance to Porlock, as follows: [...] "...the labor of writing which was so painful that I find it hard, even now, to <b>see</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> memory of the pain to whatever merit it may have." [...] However, in 1968, Buechner {{received a letter from}} Charles Price, the chaplain at Harvard, inviting him to give the Noble Lectures series in the winter of 1969. His predecessors in this role were none other than Richard Niebuhr and George Buttrick, and Buechner was both flattered and daunted by the idea of joining so august a group. When he voiced his concerns, Price replied that he should write [...] "something in the area of [...] "religion and letters."" [...] Thence came the idea to write about the everyday events of life [...] "as the alphabet through which God, of his grace, spells out his words, his meaning, to us. So The Alphabet of Grace was the title I hit upon, and what I set out to do was to try to describe a single representative day of my life in a way to suggest what there was of God to hear in it." [...] This process showed Buechner {{a way out of the}} frustration he had felt while writing The Entrance to Porlock: by drawing on his own experience, he found the means to convey his thoughts through his writing.|$|E

2500|$|The year 2015 saw Nyong’o make {{a return}} to stage with a {{starring}} role as an unnamed girl in the play Eclipsed, written by Danai Gurira. The play takes place during {{the chaos of the}} Second Liberian Civil War, where the captive wives of a rebel officer band together to form a community, until the balance of their lives are upset by the arrival of a new girl (played by Nyong'o). Eclipsed became The Public Theater's fastest-selling new production in recent history. The play premiered on Broadway at the John Golden Theatre the following year. The production became the first play with an all-black and female creative cast and crew to premiere at Broadway. Nyong'o said that she understudied the play at Yale in 2009 and was terrified to play the character on stage. Her performance met with critical acclaim. The New York Times critic Charles Isherwood called Nyong'o [...] "one of the most radiant young actors to be seen on Broadway in recent seasons, shines with a compassion that makes us <b>see</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> suffering to the indomitable humanity of its characters." [...] Nyong'o's performance in Eclipsed earned her a Theatre World Award for Outstanding Broadway or Off-Broadway Debut Performance, an Obie Award for a Distinguished Performance by an Ensemble, and a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. In addition, she was nominated for Outstanding Actress in a Play at the Outer Critics Circle Award and a Distinguished Performance Award at the Drama League Award. Nyong'o revealed in her Lenny Letter that she turned down Hollywood films in order to bring Eclipsed to life on Broadway.|$|E
