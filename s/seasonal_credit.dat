40|$|There is no {{improved}} seed-fertilizer technology {{available that}} can generate the needed growth in agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa to meet food demand by the rapidly increasing population. This paper identifies {{factors associated with}} inland valley swamp rice farmers' decisions to adopt "improved" varieties and/or fertilizer. To achieve this objective, input-specific logistic models were estimated using survey-generated data collected from {{a random sample of}} 221 rice plots (one per farmer) selected from a purposive sample of 12 Mali-Sud bas-fond villages during the 1995 - 96 cropping season. The model estimation results show that the farther the village is from the closest market, the lower the probability to adopt the "improved" variety, increasing the size of the rice plot will decrease this probability, and men are more likely to adopt "improved" varieties than women because men have access to credit through CMDT, and more alternative sources of income to finance input purchases than women. For fertilizer, the use of "improved" varieties, the presence of water control infrastructure, and the village experience in cotton production increase the likelihood that a farmer will apply this input. The significance of the village experience in cotton production and women limited access to credit suggests that one of the constrains to a wider use of modern inputs is the absence of a reliable source of these inputs and/or <b>seasonal</b> <b>credits.</b> The significance of village distance to the closest market and the presence of water control the likelihood of using these inputs suggests that there exits some technological payoff associated with well-functioning markets and road improvements because such investments reduce the effective distance between the farm and the market.

40|$|The postbellum South lagged {{the rest}} of the nation in terms of {{financial}} development. Interest rates were comparatively high, per capita bank assets were low, and regional interbank networks were slow to develop. We attribute these features of the Southern economy to highly <b>seasonal</b> <b>credit</b> demands arising from the regions extreme specialization in cotton production. The crop cycle created a mismatch between local deposit supply (high in the off season) and local loan demand (high in the production season).

This mismatch meant higher loan rates and a lower equilibrium number of banks and bank assets in the region. Our analysis is consistent with that of contemporary reformer...|$|E
40|$|The {{federal funds}} rate and the {{discount}} rate are familiar monetary policy terms. Textbooks typically describe Federal Reserve monetary policy in terms of setting a policy target for the {{federal funds rate}}, often guided by a Taylor rule–style equation.

Today, the Fed offers three discount programs: primary credit, secondary credit, and <b>seasonal</b> <b>credit,</b> {{each with its own}} interest, or discount, rate. The implementation of monetary policy in developed economies, in addition to a policy target rate and one or more discount rates, features a third, less-discussed interest rate—the “remuneration rate, ” which is the rate of interest the central bank pays on the deposits that banks hold at the central bank. 1 This interest rate, through its interaction with the policy target rat...|$|E

Primary credit {{would be available}} for very short terms, ordinarily overnight, to depository institutions that are in generally sound financial condition. Secondary credit would be available, subject to Reserve Bank approval and monitoring, for depository institutions that did not qualify for primary credit. The interest rate on primary credit would usually be above short-term market interest rates, including the federal funds rate, {{as opposed to the}} current situation in which the discount rate (the interest rate for adjustment credit) is typically below money market interest rates. Because of the above-market rate, the restrictions currently employed to limit access to adjustment credit will be unnecessary for primary credit.

40|$|Most {{countries}} in sub-Saharan Africa have reduced or eliminated fertilizer subsidies and liberalized input marketing {{as part of}} the reform process that began in the early 1980 s. The effect on fertilizer prices and use {{is one of the most}} frequently mentioned criticisms of liberalization. The effect of these reforms, however, has varied widely across countries. The study finds that fertilizer use is closely related to crop mix and access to inputs on credit, but not to household income [...] In Benin, 88 percent of the fertilizer purchased by farmers is bought on credit through the integrated cotton marketing system managed by the parastatal SONAPRA. However, almost one third of this fertilizer is diverted to maize and other crops. In Malawi, tobacco is the most important cash crop among smallholders, but less than half the tobacco growers are able to purchase fertilizers on credit. Maize accounts for about 60 percent of the fertilizer use, compared to less than a third for tobacco. This difference in the tradability of the main crop being fertilized helps explain some of the difference in performance. The results demonstrate some of the paths by which cash crop and food crop production may be complementary. This can occur through the residual effect of fertilizer on food crop production, through the alleviation of cash constraints for the purchase of fertilizer, and through the availability of inputs on credit. Thus, the benefits of export liberalization must be weighed against the risk that it will weaken the enforceability of <b>seasonal</b> agricultural <b>credit,</b> with indirect consequences for food crop productivity.

40|$|Agricultural {{production}} takes time. The lag {{between the}} start of production and the realization of output ranges from {{a few months to}} several years. In this environment, credit transactions serve to finance production and to permit farmers to consume before harvest. Moreover, the agricultural production process depends on a host of external factors, many of which are not {{under the control of the}} farmer. When production is risky and insurance markets are incomplete, credit transactions serve a valuable role by permitting people to smooth consumption in the face of a randomly fluctuating stream of income. Where farmers are poorer, these motivations for credit transactions are stronger- liquidity constraints are more likely to be binding so that production and consumption cannot be financed from savings, and the costs (in terms of utility, health, and even survival) of fluctuations in an already low level of consumption are very high. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>credit</b> transactions, therefore, are found in virtually all poor agricultural economies. The institutional arrangements through which these transactions are effected are varied and often complex. There are formal financial institutions, including banks, credit cooperatives, and group lending schemes. Many financial transactions, however, occur outside the boundaries of the formal financial system. There are specialist moneylenders, informal loans among family and friends, loans tied to purchases, labor transactions, or land rental arrangements, and a variety of informal financial groups. It is commonly the case in rural areas of poor countrie...|$|E
40|$|Small {{farmers in}} Africa {{have long been}} engaged with markets — for produce, inputs such as fertiliser, credit, labour, land and information. Opportunities to do so are {{increasing}} with urbanisation and better roads linking villages to cities, making questions that arise about smallholder commercialisation all the more important. Expectations about process and outcomes differ considerably. Some see small farms as being like any other business: given access to Box A: Poverty traps in rural Africa? Many small farmers in rural Africa use fewer inputs of improved seed, fertiliser, crop chemicals than expected, given the returns in higher yields to their use. Sometimes the cause is that farmers cannot afford the inputs, since they have little cash and cannot get <b>seasonal</b> <b>credit.</b> The transactions costs between smallholders and banks, it seems, are too high: banks are reluctant to lend to them since they know too little about the competence and character of the farmers. This can hinder commercialisation both directly as well as indirectly: if farmers cannot raise food production {{through the use of}} improved technology, {{they may not be able}} to allocate land and labour to produce commercial crops. Some, most notably Jeffrey Sachs (2004), see these problems as so severe as to constitute poverty traps. If small farmers are too poor to afford to buy inputs needed to increase their production, and cannot obtain credit to overcome their lack of liquidity, then they cannot raise production and remain poor, even when the technical means to raise outputs are well known. This argument is one reason for the subsidies on seed and fertiliser that Malawi began to offer its small farmers in 2005 that have aroused so much interest across Africa — see FAC briefing by Chirwa et al...|$|E
40|$|T {{his country}} {{study is a}} {{background}} paper prepared for the comparative analysis of organization and performance of cotton sectors in Sub-Saharan Africa, a study {{carried out by the}} World Bank, with the objective of analyzing the links between sector structure and observed performance outcomes and drawing lessons from reform experience, in order to provide useful guidance to policy-makers, other local stakeholders, and interested donor agencies. It describes and reviews the cotton sector situation in Tanzania, where, after years of uneven growth, production of seed cotton reached record levels in 2004 and 2005. Importantly for wider policy debates, the Tanzanian cotton sector, unlike many others in sub-Saharan Africa, operates in a highly competitive market structure. With high local taxes and transport costs, the sector nevertheless pays reasonably attractive prices to producers. However, the competitive market structure has also presented significant challenges, especially in relation to seed supply, quality control and <b>seasonal</b> <b>credit.</b> Following liberalization in 1994, the state largely withdrew from the cotton sector in Tanzania. However, when production fell sharply {{in the latter part of}} the decade, the state, in the form of the Tanzania Cotton Board, renewed its engagement in the affairs of the sector. Cooperation between a group of leading ginners and TCB has been central to the process of devising new institutional arrangements for the sector that facilitate coordination for seed multiplication and input supply (amongst other things) in a context of the highly competitive market for seed cotton. As long as the sector retains this highly competitive structure, there will be a vital role for TCB in ensuring that important strategic decisions are taken to promote sector development. Tanzania thus represents an interesting study in public-private collaboration and sector governance. It also represents an important test case of whether a competitive market model can be made to work for African cotton...|$|E
40|$|Microfinance {{has been}} {{celebrated in the}} last decade as a new {{paradigm}} shift in lending that has achieved immense success in improving the living standards of the poor through the provision of financial services. Institutions involved in microfinance around the world have used innovative loan contract mechanisms to profitably lend to the poor and achieve very high repayment rates while allowing the borrowers to profit and grow their enterprises. While high repayment rates have been realized by microfinance institutions focused on lending to consumers and to retail-type micro enterprises, few microfinance institutions focused on lending to agricultural producers have achieved comparable success. This article compares the mechanisms employed by major microfinance institutions with a successful lending institution in Zambia that serves agricultural businesses. Findings are: ZATAC uses progressive lending and group lending contracts adapted in some ways to suit <b>seasonal</b> agricultural production <b>credit</b> requirements. The institution also uses various forms of collateral substitutes like other microfinance institutions. We also find that ZATAC uses other mechanisms such as automatic loan repayments tied to production, cooperative sanctions, contracted production and provision of business development services that eventually improve loan repayments significantly and enable the lender to lower interest rates.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} case of a Zambian {{institution}} providing credit for smallholder agribusiness commercialization and compares this lender?s model with the major microfinance institutions, to identify specific mechanisms employed by the lender and how these have been adapted to suit <b>seasonal</b> agricultural production <b>credit</b> requirements. Econometric models are developed to examine the influence of key economic factors such as nominal and real interest rates, loan fees, and loan term on the supply of credit by the lender. Other important factors considered relevant in the lender?s market include availability of contract markets for financed production and the type of borrower (cooperative or investor-owned agribusinesses). The study uses loan-level and firm-level loan data aggregated from an electronic loan database of individual loan files kept by the lender. Cross sectional data over three years (2005 ? 2007) are used in the study. The study finds that loan fees, loan term and availability of contract markets to borrowers are the key determinants of credit supply. In addition, the study finds that interest rates do not significantly influence the lender?s credit supply decisions, a finding that is consistent with literature on credit rationing in markets with asymmetric information. The study finds no evidence of economies of scale benefit to the lender being passed along to borrowers through lower loan fees. The study contributes to the literature and development needs of agricultural lenders and smallholder agribusinesses in Zambia through the analysis of different factors that influence the lender?s credit supply decisions...|$|R
40|$|As {{the locus}} of cotton {{production}} shifted toward the newer southwestern states over {{the first half of}} the nineteenth century, the city of New Orleans became increasingly important to the slave-plantation economy of the U. S. South. Moreover, because of its location near the base of the enormous Mississippi River system, the city also thrived on the export of agricultural commodities from western states farther upriver. Handling this wide-ranging commerce was the city's business community: bankers, factors, and wholesalers, among others. This globally oriented community represented an older and qualitatively unique form of wealth accumulation, merchant capitalism, which was based on the extraction of profit from exchange processes. However, like the slave-based mode of production to which it was closely allied, the New Orleans merchant community faced increasing pressure during the antebellum decades even while its fortunes seemed otherwise secure. The city lost most of its market share in western grain products to railroads and other routes linked directly to northeastern urban centers, and its merchants' failure to maintain port infrastructure or create a viable manufacturing sector reflected their complacency and left them vulnerable to competition from the fast-developing industrially-based economy of the North. These and other weaknesses were fatally exposed during the Civil War and Reconstruction. As a result of many changes to the regional and national political economy after northern victory in the war, the New Orleans merchant community was never able to recover its previous commercial dominance, and the former first-rank American city quickly became a site of notorious political corruption and endemic poverty. Much the same can be said of the postbellum southern economy in which it was embedded, where the practices of merchant capitalism nevertheless managed to persist by becoming dispersed throughout the agricultural interior in the form of "country stores. " Under the sharecropping system that became prevalent in cotton production, rural merchants furnished <b>seasonal</b> <b>credit</b> to the small farming households that had replaced plantation slavery. Although these stores played different roles in Louisiana cotton and sugar parishes, the culture of merchant capitalism hampered economic development in the South for many decades to come...|$|E
40|$|Most of {{the rural}} {{population}} in Mozambique operates totally outside the reach of any financial sector operator. Nearly all {{of the rural}} districts have no formal banking facilities at all. The microfinance sector is small and has an urban and peri-urban orientation, while both the community-based financial arrangements and development credit institutions have a very limited outreach in rural areas. This institutional situation makes {{it very difficult for}} the financial sector to respond to the increasing demands for rural financial services in the country and today practically all <b>seasonal</b> agricultural <b>credit</b> to smallholders is provided by marketing and processing companies under interlocking arrangements. These interlocking arrangements vary from the contract farming to the farmers’ cooperatives. This study focuses on the contract farming type of coordination. It refers to a situation where the contractor agrees on providing inputs and extension services, and expects that the farmer in return provide the input for the agro-processing industry. The contractor can be from the small commercial entity to the enormous agro-processing industry. This arrangement has the potential, according to the literature reviewed, to alleviate the problems arising in the contractual arrangements, like moral hazard and asymmetric information that generates market failures. It also is considered as potential credit channel to the smallholders in rural areas, once they are targeted by the credit market failure. The operations and traditional production technology of the typical family farm, and its associated credit needs, are too small to warrant the economic extension of the formal credit system. In the short term it can not be expected that the commercial banks would reconsider their strategies of market expansion into agricultural commerce. This study aims to assess to what extent contract farming can be considered as one attenuating instrument of the hindered rural financial sector. The study draws upon the contract farming scheme practiced by the MLT – Mozambique Leaf Tobacco Ltd and DIMMON – Tabacos de Moçambique, in the Tete province. The data was collected using standard and simple, but credible, methodology. The data was obtained through the Ministry of Agriculture, Centro de Promoção de Investimentos (CPI) and some private institutions and individuals. For the confirmation and additional information on the CF scheme, the company’s management were contacted. In terms of the data analysis three main approaches were taken to gradually increase confirmation of the proposed hypothesis. One was a triangulation of positivism, post positivism and logical empiricism in order to consider both quantitative and qualitative information. Secondly, Econometrics approach was used. It helped to inspect the sample, through sample mean tests, student t-test and one-way analysis of variance. In addition to this, regression analysis were also used, namely Linear and Logistic (Logit), in order to assess the hypotheses derived for the topic of the study. And finally the case study method which allowed the analysis of a specific case from Mozambique, already mentioned above, being the case of the Tete province’s tobacco agro-industrial companies. The results it’s of the regressions ran, suggest that the location (district), the land proportion reserved for each type of crop, the hand tools endowment, level of credit in terms of value are important determinants for the success of the CF’s credit scheme as alternative source of credit for the tobacco growers of Tete province. The regressions showed also that there is a relation between the income per member of the household and their characteristic, but it is not as strong to support the idea that their characteristics explain why they are better off under the CF scheme. But it also does not reject the idea that growers characteristics, like the household size, their core activities, whether is farming or/and outside farming, do show some important effects on their well being. As to conclusions, the agro-industrial CF scheme was shown to be a good alternative to alleviate the credit constraint problem. The results also suggest that CF {{can be used as a}} way to link small-scale farmers with agribusiness, on condition that the correct governance structures, good relation between the parties and reduction of transaction cost are taken into account. But at the same time it is also clear that company credit is not, and does not aim to be, a substitute for the operations of the financial institutions. The range of financial services provided by the marketing companies is very narrow, consisting in most cases only of small in-kind seasonal loans. From different alternatives of coordination options that came up, it was clear that not a unique one of them could be considered as the most appropriate one in order to attenuate the problem analysed. The problem of the agriculture development goes beyond the credit issue to inputs and technology availability, access to markets, transportation and stocking facilities are few among the many existents. Thus there should by an integrated analysis of these issues in order to compute a strategic plan comprising both sectors, financial and agricultural, for the development of the agricultural sector...|$|R
