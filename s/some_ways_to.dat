5|$|One {{special case}} of Maldacena's {{proposal}} says that N=4 super Yang–Mills theory, a gauge theory similar in <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> quantum chromodynamics, {{is equivalent to}} string theory in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. This result helped clarify the earlier work of 't Hooft {{on the relationship between}} string theory and quantum chromodynamics, taking string theory back to its roots as a theory of nuclear physics. Maldacena's results also provided a concrete realization of the holographic principle with important implications for quantum gravity and black hole physics. By the year 2015, Maldacena's paper had become the most highly cited paper in high energy physics with over 10,000 citations. These subsequent articles have provided considerable evidence that the correspondence is correct, although so far it has not been rigorously proved.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{suggested}} that the unique skull shape of Majungasaurus and other abelisaurids indicate different predatory habits than other theropods. Whereas most theropods were characterized by long, low skulls of narrow width, abelisaurid skulls were taller and wider, and often shorter in length as well. The narrow skulls of other theropods were well equipped to withstand the vertical stress of a powerful bite, but not as good at withstanding torsion (twisting). In comparison to modern mammalian predators, most theropods may have used a strategy similar in <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> that of long- and narrow-snouted canids, with the delivery of many bites weakening the prey animal.|$|E
5000|$|As {{originally}} envisioned, the MiniTSFO {{would be}} a complete system that required only a computer to play. This meant that there had <b>to</b> be <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> see targets on-screen, <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> locate the target coordinates such as a map, and <b>some</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> call for fire. This resulted in a combination of three screens which the user could flip back-and-forth by using function keys. The first screen showed a simutated view through an AN/GVS-5 laser rangefinder. The map screen was a depiction of the fictional German town of Nitzburg and surrounding area. Lastly, the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> enter firing commands was a virtual AN/PSG-2 Digital Message Device (DMD).|$|R

5|$|The female {{is similar}} in <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> the male, but paler and duller. It is sandy grey or brown, with a back {{patterned}} {{like that of the}} male, and white or whitish underparts. The head of the females of the subspecies ammodendri and nigricans is dingy grey with darker smudges on the forehead, behind its eyes, and on its throat. The female of the subspecies stoliczkae is buff-brown with a white throat, a conspicuous pale supercilium, darker forehead, and lighter cheeks. The juvenile is similar to the female, differing in its lack of dark tinges on its throat and crown. In adults, moulting begins in July and ends in late August or early September. The post-juvenile moult is complete, and occurs variously from June to August.|$|E

A second specimen, the holotype of Epidendrosaurus ninchengensis (IVPP V12653), also shows features indicating it was a juvenile.

25|$|Bonsai is a Japanese art using {{miniature}} trees {{grown in}} containers, similar in <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> the Chinese art of penjing and the Vietnamese art of hòn non bộ.

Similar methods may exist in other traditions, but this article deals with the traditional deadwood terminology and techniques used in the Japanese practice of bonsai.|$|E
25|$|Following {{their return}} from exile in Geneva {{during the reign}} of Queen Mary I and King Philip, English Protestants known as Puritans (who {{remained}} within the Church of England) and separatists (who separated from it) began to attempt to introduce some of the more radical reforms they had experienced in Geneva into the worship of the Church of England, and in <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> go beyond them. They sought to rid worship of any element not specifically prescribed in the Bible, though they disagreed on the practical implications of this. They also favored liturgical decisions to be made at the lowest level possible, rather than by a regional or national authority.|$|E

25|$|In Southland, the Model T Ford railcars were {{assigned}} to the Waikaia and the Wyndham (Glenham) branches and began operating in late May 1926. These two lines were similar in <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> the Greytown Branch; although they did not have multiple shuttle services to connect with mainline trains, they served small towns with insufficient demand for locomotive-hauled carriage passenger trains. Previously, the two lines had been served by mixed trains that carried both passengers and freight, and as they had to load and unload freight along the way, trip times were slow and thus unpopular. It was hoped the Model T Ford railcars would rejuvenate traffic and provide some measure of profitability, especially on the section of the Wyndham Branch from Wyndham to Glenham, which was so underutilised that it was facing closure.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{prominent}} styles of old-time music in Canada are the Scottish-derived tradition of Nova Scotia (particularly Cape Breton Island), the French Canadian music of Quebec and Acadia, the old-time music of Ontario, and the prairie fiddling {{traditions of the}} central-western provinces. It is here (primarily in Manitoba and Saskatchewan) that the fiddle tradition of the Métis people is found. The traditional folk music of Newfoundland and Labrador, though similar in <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> that {{of the rest of}} Atlantic Canada, has a distinct style of its own, and is generally considered as its own genre. For the past 11 years, Saskatchewan has annually hosted an Old Time and Bluegrass music camp and festival near Big River Saskatchewan for a week combining both a music festival alongside educational learning sessions.|$|E
500|$|Although Balzac did {{not draw}} {{specifically}} {{from the women}} in his life to create Valérie, parallels have been observed in some areas. The tumultuous end of his affair with Louise Breugniot and the advantage she gains from his devotion to Mme. Hanska is similar in <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> Valérie's manipulation of Steinbock. Critics also connect the pride and anguish felt by Balzac during Mme. Hanska's pregnancy and miscarriage to the same emotions felt by Baron Hulot when Valérie conceives and loses her child. Although he never ascribed to Mme. Hanska any of the traits in Valérie's treacherous character, he felt a devotion {{similar to that of}} Hulot. He once wrote to her: [...] "je fais pour mon Eve toute les folies qu'un Hulot fait pour une Marneffe, je te donnerai mon sang, mon honneur, ma vie" [...] ("I commit for [...] all the follies that a Hulot commits for Madame Marneffe; I give you my blood, my honor, my life").|$|E

500|$|Although Sullivan {{sought in}} <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> be a {{moderate}} {{voice in the}} highly partisan disagreements between Federalists and Republicans, he supported the policy of President Thomas Jefferson in embargoing trade with Great Britain and France, who were then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars. [...] The Embargo Act of 1807 had a significant negative impact on shipping interests based in Massachusetts ports, and Federalists sought to use this, and the threats of war emanating from the Jefferson administration, to unseat Sullivan in 1808. [...] Federalist Senator Timothy Pickering wrote an open letter raising the specter of war and charging Jefferson with failing to publish critical documents in ongoing negotiations. [...] He then asked Sullivan to formally {{send it to the}} state legislature, with the view that this would imply Sullivan's agreement with its content. [...] Sullivan refused, after which Federalists used that fact to charge that Republicans generally were withholding damaging information. [...] Sullivan's defense included letters by Senator John Quincy Adams countering the Federalist charges. [...] While this was sufficient to ensure Sullivan's reelection in 1808, control of the legislature was returned to the Federalists. [...] Republicans were unhappy with Sullivan's handling of the political attacks, and for his refusal to remove Federalists from patronage positions in the government.|$|E
500|$|Gibbons said he {{deliberately}} {{constructed the}} visual look of Watchmen {{so that each}} page would be identifiable {{as part of that}} particular series and [...] "not some other comic book". He made a concerted effort to draw the characters in a manner different than that commonly seen in comics. The artist tried to draw the series with [...] "a particular weight of line, using a hard, stiff pen that didn't have much modulation in terms of thick and thin" [...] which he hoped [...] "would differentiate it from the usual lush, fluid kind of comic book line". In a 2009 interview, Moore recalled that he took advantage of Gibbons' training as a former surveyor for [...] "including incredible amounts of detail in every tiny panel, so we could choreograph every little thing". Gibbons described the series as [...] "a comic about comics". Gibbons felt that [...] "Alan is more concerned with the social implications of [...] and I've gotten involved in the technical implications." [...] The story's alternate world setting allowed Gibbons to change details of the American landscape, such as adding electric cars, slightly different buildings, and spark hydrants instead of fire hydrants, which Moore said, [...] "perhaps gives the American readership a chance in <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> see their own culture as an outsider would". Gibbons noted that the setting was liberating for him because {{he did not have to}} rely primarily on reference books.|$|E
500|$|The Tempest, Hazlitt claims, {{is one of}} Shakespeare's [...] "most {{original}} and perfect" [...] plays, similar in <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> A Midsummer Night's Dream but finer as a play, if not as rich in poetic passages. The Tempest demonstrates the author to be a master of both comedy and tragedy, with a full command over [...] "all the resources of passion, of wit, of thought, of observation". Yet again, Hazlitt here devotes considerable space to not just {{the characters in the}} play, but the character of the play as a whole. The world of the play seems to be created out of nothing; yet, though dream-like, in large part a product of the imagination, its setting resembles that of a painting we may have seen—"Prospero's enchanted island [...] airy music, the tempest-tost vessel, the turbulent waves, all have the effect of the landscape background of some fine picture"—its poetry having a music that conjures up meaning in the listener's mind—"the songs [...] without conveying any distinct images, seem to recall all the feelings connected with them, like snatches of half-forgotten music heard indistinctly and at intervals"—and its characters, many of whom, like Ariel, we know could not really exist, are drawn so as to seem [...] "as true and natural as [...] real characters". All is so artfully unified that [...] "that part which is only the fantastic creation of his mind, has the same palpable texture, and coheres 'semblably' with the rest." ...|$|E
