2500|$|Empire Defender {{departed}} from Southend on 27 September {{as a member}} of Convoy FN 524, which arrived at Methil on 29 September. The next day, she {{departed from}} Methil to join Convoy EC 79, which had departed from Southend on 28 September and arrived at Oban, Argyllshire on 3 October. She sailed on to the Clyde, arriving on 3 October. Empire Defender was ordered to sail from Glasgow to Malta laden with ammunition, as part of Operation Astrologer. On 20 October 1941, 60 lascar sailors refused to sail, claiming that the vessel was cursed and would be sunk before the next new moon. The authorities were unable to persuade them to sail by either threats or inducements. An equivalent number of white sailors were procured with a payment of Â£10 in cash each to accept the lascar accommodation. The ship had been repainted with a black hull, white topsides and a buff funnel, contrary to wartime regulations. All armament had been removed {{in an effort to make}} the ship appear as though it belonged to a neutral country. She departed from the Clyde on 29 October to join Convoy OG 76, which departed from Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire on 26 October and arrived at Gibraltar on 11 November. Empire Defender passed Gibraltar on 11 November, and headed for Malta. The flag of whichever nation's waters she was in at the time was painted on her hull, thus she was passed off as a French, Spanish and Italian <b>ship.</b> <b>Operation</b> Astrologer had probably been compromised following the loss of the merchantman [...] on 2 May 1941 and the subsequent interrogation of her crew who were interned in France. The progress of Empire Defender had probably been monitored from the Spanish coast. On 14 November 1941, she was attacked either by a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 or a Savoia-Marchetti S.84 aircraft of the Regia Aeronautica, which dropped an aerial torpedo. Empire Defender was set on fire and her crew abandoned her. They had only just done this when she blew up and sank [...] south of the Galite Islands, Tunisia. Four of her crew were killed. The survivors became Prisoners of War. Those lost on Empire Defender are commemorated on the Tower Hill Memorial, London.|$|E

40|$|The {{environmental}} impacts generated by <b>shipping</b> <b>operations</b> have increasingly {{become an important}} research topic, where its pollutants often pose negative externalities to natural habitats and economic losses to coastal areas. While the environmental impact costs generated by shipping disasters, notably large scale accidental oil spills, have been widely studied, hitherto, works dedicated to the assessment of environmental impact costs of pollutants generated by routine <b>shipping</b> <b>operations</b> remain scarce due to their relatively implicit nature and thus delays of consequential risks. Hence, by proposing an economic model and calibrating it to Port of Rotterdam, this paper assesses the environmental impact costs generated by routine <b>shipping</b> <b>operations</b> on ports. By shedding light on this important, but under-researched, issue critical {{to the well-being of}} the global shipping industry, this paper provides a decent framework for further research in sustainable shipping and port management for future generations.
