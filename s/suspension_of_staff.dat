5000|$|The story {{starts off}} with Sara being arrested {{for the murder}} of Christina (Scofield) Hampton, during her and Michael's wedding reception. It is implied that {{surveillance}} video was altered by agents loyal to the General (Jonathan Krantz) (Leon Russom) by removing Christina's gun to make it look as if Sara shot Christina in cold blood rather than self-defence. She is held in the Miami-Dade State Penitentiary, where overcrowding necessitates that the female prison and jail inmates are housed in the same building. Gretchen Morgan watches from a distance, having been imprisoned after the events in [...] "The Sunshine State". Sara is attacked as revenge by the Miami-Dade COs for having left the infirmary door unlocked, allowing the [...] "Fox River Eight" [...] to escape and eventual dismissal or <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> several <b>staff</b> members <b>of</b> Fox River.|$|R
2500|$|There {{has also}} been some {{controversy}} and litigation at the university over time. [...] Controversy began over the wording and adoption of new university statutes on <b>suspension</b> and dismissal <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> by the Governing Authority, {{on the recommendation of}} the president, as required by the Universities Act 1997. In 2002, the Labour Court recommended that this statute be rewritten [...] and this has been followed by long-running negotiations between the university and the trade union representing staff, SIPTU; In 2008 a vote organised by SIPTU led to a majority <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> who voted declaring no confidence in the management of the university in its conduct of these negotiations.|$|R
2500|$|It {{has been}} noted that {{disabled}} people are disproportionately affected by disability abuse and bullying, and such activity has been cited as a hate crime. The bullying {{is not limited to}} those who are visibly disabled – such as wheelchair-users or individuals with physical deformities (e.g., cleft lip) – but also those with learning disabilities such as autism and developmental coordination disorder. In the latter case, this is linked to a poor ability in physical education, and this behaviour can be encouraged by an ignorant physical education teacher. Abuse of the disabled is not limited to schools; there are many known cases in which the disabled have been abused by <b>staff</b> <b>of</b> a [...] "care institution", such as the case revealed in a BBC Panorama programme on a Castlebeck care home (Winterbourne View) near Bristol, leading to its closure and <b>suspension</b> or firing <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> members.|$|R

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the operation and}} impact <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> performance and service delivery of the In-service training programme for Junior Library Assistants of the Ghana Library Authority. The ever increasing growth in the volume of publications in all fields of knowledge coupled {{with the advent of}} information and communication technologies in libraries has widened the scope of library services. There is therefore the need for public libraries to train their staff in order to perform effectively and efficiently. The survey method was used and data was collected using open and closed ended questionnaires and interviews. In all, 80 questionnaires were administered to 47 staff and 33 ex-workers of the Ghana Library Authority. The findings showed that most Junior Library <b>Staff</b> <b>of</b> the Authority lack basic skills in library routine work and this could be attributed to the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> the GLA In-service training programme. The study also revealed that the bulk <b>of</b> the Junior <b>Staff</b> at the GLA had qualifications ranging from GCE O’ level and SSSCE to Diploma. The study further revealed that the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> the programme was as a result of several factors such as the absence of a Board, training budget and a non-functioning training department. The study recommended among other things the resumption of the In-service training programme to enable all untrained Junior Library Staff receive training...|$|R

40|$|Arguably, {{eliminating}} <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments [...] {{periods when}} banks jointly refuse to convert their liabilities into outside money or other assets [...] {{was an important}} impetus for creating the Federal Reserve. Friedman and Schwartz suggest that a suspension in 1930 would have decreased {{the severity of the}} Great Depression. More recently, an emerging literature suggests that <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments may well be optimal in some states of the world. We present evidence about <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> payments from an episode that is close to a controlled experiment for examining their effects. In 1861, about 44 percent of the banks in Wisconsin closed, 81 percent of the banks in Illinois closed, and noteholders suffered substantial losses. The historical record suggests a possible explanation: an effective <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments in Wisconsin but not Illinois. Historical and statistical evidence indicate that the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments decreased the number of banks that closed as well as noteholders' losses. Our statistical evidence indicates a 25 percent increase in the probability that an average bank in the two states remains open with the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> payments.

40|$|Article 27 - 2 of the Penal Code in Japan {{requires}} that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> {{execution of the}} sentence' should be judged in view of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing re-offending'. Some, on the other hand, argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be "balanced" with the criminal responsibility of the offender, which is {{greater than that of}} those whose execution of the sentence is fully suspended and is smaller than that of those whose sentence is partially executed. However, I think that this method of judgment ignores the requirements of Article 27 - 2, simply imposing the `penalty' in the community, which has no desirable effect on the offender's rehabilitation. Furthermore, such method of judgment might assign a longer `penalty' to the offender whose sentence had been fully executed with short or no parole term, because of his/her criminal responsibility. In this paper, I reconsider the discussion on `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' and `full <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' in order to clarify the image of those whose sentence is `partially suspended' under Article 27 - 2. Through this process, I argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be determined with sufficient consideration of `the necessity and appropriateness of preventing reoffending...|$|R
5000|$|The term <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> disbelief or willing <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> disbelief {{has been}} defined as a {{willingness}} to suspend one's critical faculties and believe the unbelievable; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment.
