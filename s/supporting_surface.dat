He aimed to obtain more power from the propulsion system, and design drawings show the arrangement of two air-cooled rotary engines {{on the sides of}} the fuselage. The placement of the engines indicates that Coandă did not intend to inject fuel into the jet stream and ignite it as the cooling of the engines would have been compromised. The patent was annotated with an additional claim on 19 July 1911 which brought significant changes including the addition of retractable landing gear with dampers inside aerodynamic fairings with skids, removal of the horizontal stabiliser, a <b>supporting</b> <b>surface</b> was provided for each engine and their accessories were covered to improve aerodynamics. Though Coandă continued to study rotary propulsion mechanisms, Antoniu believes that Coandă never implemented a practical solution because of the lack of funds.|$|E

40|$|Aim: External chest {{compression}} (ECC) efficacy {{is influenced by}} factors including the <b>surface</b> <b>supporting</b> the patient. Air-filled <b>support</b> <b>surfaces</b> are deflated for cardiopulmonary resuscitation, with little evidence to substantiate this. We investigated the effect that differing <b>support</b> <b>surfaces</b> had on ECC efficacy using a CPR manikin model. Methodology: Four participants carried out four cycles of ECC with an assistant ventilating. The subjects were blinded to the seven <b>support</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the order was randomised. For each participant/surface combination, ECC variables and the participants' perceptions were measured. Results: Participants produced effective ECC with the manikin on the floor (mean proportion correct, 94. 5 %; mean depth, 42. 5 mm). Compared with the floor: the proportion of correct ECC was less for the overlay inflated (P < 0. 05); the depth of ECC was less effective (30 - 37 mm) for the overlay inflated/deflated and low-air-loss inflated and foam mattresses (P < 0. 05). The foam mattress, overlay inflated/deflated, and low-air-loss inflated were perceived as being less stable and as having reduced ECC efficacy compared with the floor. There was no difference or agreement, regarding subjects' perceptions or ECC variables, between the <b>support</b> <b>surfaces</b> or between inflated/deflated air-filled <b>support</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Conclusion: The efficacy of ECC {{is affected by the}} <b>support</b> <b>surfaces.</b> There seems little evidence to substantiate deflating all air-filled <b>support</b> <b>surfaces</b> for CPR.

60|$|In young plants the tendrils {{are about}} three inches in length: they bear two lateral and two {{terminal}} branches; and each branch bifurcates twice, with the tips terminating in blunt double hooks, having both points {{directed to the}} same side. All the branches are sensitive on all sides; and after being lightly rubbed, or after coming into contact with a stick, bend in about 10 m. One which had become curved in 10 m. after a light rub, continued bending for between 3 hrs. and 4 hrs., and became straight again in 8 hrs. or 9 hrs. Tendrils, which have caught nothing, ultimately contract into an irregular spire, as they likewise do, only much more quickly, after clasping a support. In both cases the main petiole bearing the leaflets, which is at first straight and inclined a little upwards, moves downwards, with the middle part bent abruptly into a right angle; but this is seen in E. miniatus more plainly than in E. scaber. The tendrils in this genus act in some respects like those of Bignonia capreolata; but the whole does not move from the light, nor do the hooked tips become enlarged into cellular discs. After the tendrils have {{come into contact with}} a moderately thick cylindrical stick or with rugged bark, the several branches may be seen slowly to lift themselves up, change their positions, and again come into contact with the <b>supporting</b> <b>surface.</b> The object of these movements is to bring the double-hooks at the extremities of the branches, which naturally face in all directions, into contact with the wood. I have watched a tendril, half of which had bent itself at right angles round the sharp corner of a square post, neatly bring every single hook into contact with both rectangular surfaces. The appearance suggested the belief, that though the whole tendril is not sensitive to light, yet that the tips are so, and that they turn and twist themselves towards any dark surface. Ultimately the branches arrange themselves very neatly to all the irregularities of the most rugged bark, so that they resemble in their irregular course a river with its branches, as engraved on a map. But when a tendril has wound round a rather thick stick, the subsequent spiral contraction generally draws it away and spoils the neat arrangement. So it is, but not in quite so marked a manner, when a tendril has spread itself over a large, nearly flat surface of rugged bark. We may therefore conclude that these tendrils are not perfectly adapted to seize moderately thick sticks or rugged bark. If a thin stick or twig is placed near a tendril, the terminal branches wind quite round it, and then seize their own lower branches or the main stem. The stick is thus firmly, but not neatly, grasped. What the tendrils are really adapted for, appears to be such objects as the thin culms of certain grasses, or the long flexible bristles of a brush, or thin rigid leaves such as those of the Asparagus, all of which they seize in an admirable manner. This is due to the extremities of the branches close to the little hooks being extremely sensitive to a touch from the thinnest object, which they consequently curl round and clasp. When a small brush, for instance, was placed near a tendril, the tips of each sub-branch seized one, two, or three of the bristles; and then the spiral contraction of the several branches brought all these little parcels close together, so that thirty or forty bristles were drawn into a single bundle, which afforded an excellent support.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} if increasing the potential risk of slipping on <b>support</b> <b>surface</b> materials decreases postural dynamics and task performance. Seated subjects were asked to exert maximum horizontal two-handed isometric pushes as quickly as possible on a dynamometric bar. Reaction forces exerted at seat (Rxs and Rzs) and footrest (Rxf and Rzf) were measured using force sensors. A dynamometric bar measured horizontal push force (Fx). Global adherence ratio (micro) was calculated. Three <b>support</b> <b>surface</b> materials, characterised by different coefficients of friction, were tested. The same surfaces were placed on the seat and the footrest during a series of pushes.

40|$|Background Pressure ulcer {{prevention}} {{has been}} an important and a common health care problem in every health care setting. Pressure ulcers are the clinical situation that can be avoided. To prevent pressure ulcer, the main strategy is to reduce either the pressure contact time, or magnitude of pressure, between a patient and his or her <b>support</b> <b>surface.</b> Pressure-relieving <b>support</b> <b>surfaces</b> are shown to be effective in preventing the development of pressure ulcer with strong evidence support. In Hong Kong, the low compliance of the ward staff to apply pressure-relieving <b>support</b> <b>surfaces</b> for at risk patients is compared with other countries. Therefore, a feasible evidence-based guideline of using pressure-relieving <b>support</b> <b>surfaces</b> to prevent pressure ulcers stands out from the multi-interventions pressure ulcer prevention guideline to maximize its effectiveness in this clinical issue. Purpose Reviewing the needs in modifying the current clinical practice and guidelines in local setting, the aim of the dissertation is to develop evidence-based guidelines for prevention of pressure ulcers using pressure‐relieving <b>support</b> <b>surface</b> for bedbound elderly. The findings are used to develop recommendations for nursing guideline to prevent pressure ulcers through the utilization of pressure‐relieving <b>support</b> <b>surface</b> in Hong Kong public hospital setting. Methods Four electronic databases published from 1937 to 2012 were searched. All the studies extracted were randomised controlled trials while focusing on using pressure-relieving <b>support</b> <b>surfaces</b> to prevent pressure ulcers of adult patients. The quality of each study was assessed by a methodology checklist, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network in order to justify the level of evidence of the studies’ internal validity. Conclusion From the evidence, the clearest conclusion that can be drawn is that a range of pressure‐relieving mattresses and overlays in the prevention of pressure ulcers can outperform the standard hospital mattress. It can be applied to any health care settings. The reviewed studies have shown that pressure‐relieving mattresses are effective on at risk patients, especially they are in advanced age with low mobility. Therefore, this evidence-based guidelines will serve in the medical rehabilitation wards {{to reduce the number of}} elderly from developing pressure ulcer after using the pressure‐relieving <b>supporting</b> <b>surfaces.</b> published_or_final_versionNursing StudiesMasterMaster of Nursin...|$|R
