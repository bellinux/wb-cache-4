25|$|The {{showcasing}} and unorthodoxy of Dilshan {{was best}} highlighted against India on 15 December 2009, where Sri Lanka chased a mammoth target of 414 posted by India. The pitch at Rajkot looked <b>so</b> <b>nice</b> to bat on, Dilshan started the run chase with Tharanga, instead of Jayasuriya. The blistering knock reached fifty from 38 balls and then hundred from 73 balls. His first 150 came from 115 balls and Sri Lanka {{on the brink}} of a sensational win. The knock of 160 was full of hooks, pulls and many scoops of his variety, leading the way to victory. But after Dilshan falls bowled by Harbhajan Singh, the match opened for Indians. They took all the advantages and Sri Lanka bowled out for 411 runs, in an eye margin for the victory. This was Dilshan's third century in ODIs, where the match was described by commentators as one of the best chases in World Cricket.|$|E

Gossip columnist Hedda Hopper (and Parsons' arch rival) showed up to the screening uninvited. Most of the critics at the preview said that they liked the film and gave it good advanced reviews.

In 1988 and again in 1989, 47 mushers entered. In 1989, 31 completed the race—the most that have ever finished it. In 1990, Connie and Terri Frerichs became the first (and so far only) mother and daughter to compete in the same Yukon Quest: Terri finished 21st, beating her mother (22nd) by 26minutes. The 1991 race saw eight teams withdraw in the first quarter because of an outbreak of a canine disease called the [...] "Healy Virus". Thirty-five more dogs were sickened before the spread of the virus was halted by colder weather halfway through the race. In 1992, unseasonable warmth caused problems {{in the first half of}} the race, and the second was affected by bitter cold. The head veterinarian of that race, Jeannie Olson, was replaced after she offered canine acupuncture to several mushers. Though not then forbidden by any rule, this violated equal-treatment guidelines because she did not offer the treatment to every musher. At the end of that race, George Cook became the first musher since 1984 to finish short of Whitehorse when open water on the Yukon River prevented him from continuing. Because he did not quit, race officials gave him the Red Lantern Award.|$|E

Daniel Goldberg of Slant Magazine praised Mary Alice's narration in the series finale in 2012, writing: [...] "There was one resolution that truly resonated. When the ladies all move out of [...] Lane and politely promise {{to keep in touch}} and visit, Mary Alice (Brenda Strong) takes the opportunity to unearth one last lie. With one of her most somber voiceovers ever, she lets us in on a secret that the housewives already know: They won’t keep in touch, and they won’t visit. The moment is far more unsettling and existential than the overblown sequence of the desperately deceased gathering to wave Susan goodbye. Deep friendships and passing acquaintances can never be replicated, and these are the endings we experience every day, even as we try to deny their finality." [...] Writing for Backstage magazine in 2012, Jeffery Self wrote that Strong's narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming [...] "one of the most familiar on television".
