Using maximum likelihood to estimate these parameters often breaks down, with one parameter tending to the <b>specific</b> <b>value</b> that causes the likelihood to be infinite, rendering the other parameters inconsistent.

[...] Making {{the diameter of}} the inner conductor larger will decrease R and decreasing R decreases the loss. [...] On the other hand, Z0 depends on the ratio of the diameters of outer and inner conductors (Dr) and will decrease with increasing inner conductor diameter thus increasing the loss. [...] There is a <b>specific</b> <b>value</b> of Dr for which the loss is a minimum and this turns out to be 3.6. [...] For an air dielectric coax this corresponds to a characteristic impedance of 77Œ©. [...] The coax produced during the war was rigid air-insulated pipe, and this remained the case for some time afterwards. [...] The second requirement is for maximum power handling and was an important requirement for radar. [...] This is not the same condition as minimum loss because power handling is usually limited by the breakdown voltage of the dielectric. [...] However, there is a similar compromise in terms of the ratio of conductor diameters. [...] Making the inner conductor too large results in a thin insulator which breaks down at a lower voltage. [...] On the other hand, making the inner conductor too small results in higher electric field strength near the inner conductor (because the field lines are closer together on the smaller circumference) and again reduces the breakdown voltage. [...] The ideal ratio, Dr, for maximum power handling turns out to be 1.65 and corresponds to a characteristic impedance of 30Œ© in air.

For example, the electrons in a CRT display have a De Broglie wavelength of about 10‚àí13 m. To prevent the wave function for such a particle being spread over all space, de Broglie proposed using wave packets to represent particles that are localized in space. [...] The spatial spread of the wave packet, {{and the spread of}} the wavenumbers of sinusoids that make up the packet, correspond to the uncertainties in the particle's position and momentum, the product of which is bounded by Heisenberg uncertainty principle.|$|E
2500|$|Professor Raymond Andrew at the University of Nottingham in the UK {{pioneered the}} {{development}} of high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. He {{was the first to}} report the introduction of the MAS (magic angle sample spinning; MASS) technique that allowed him to achieve spectral resolution in solids sufficient to distinguish between chemical groups with either different chemical shifts or distinct Knight shifts. In MASS, the sample is spun at several kilohertz around an axis that makes the so-called magic angle Œ∏m (which is ~54.74¬∞, where [...] ) with respect to the direction of the static magnetic field B0; as a result of such magic angle sample spinning, the chemical shift anisotropy bands are averaged to their corresponding average (isotropic) chemical shift values. The above expression involving cos2Œ∏m has its origin in a calculation that predicts the magnetic dipolar interaction effects to cancel out for the <b>specific</b> <b>value</b> of Œ∏m called the magic angle. One notes that correct alignment of the sample rotation axis {{as close as possible to}} Œ∏m is essential for cancelling out the dipolar interactions whose strength for angles sufficiently far from Œ∏m is usually greater than ~10kHz for C‚ÄìH bonds in solids, for example, and it is thus greater than their CSA values.|$|E

It is the most extensive ancient Egyptian mathematical document known to historians. The Rhind Papyrus contains problems where linear equations of the form [...] and [...] are solved, where a, b, and c are known and x, which is referred to as [...] "aha" [...] or heap, is the unknown. or , where a and b and c are known and x is unknown.

[...] A specific false value has been proposed by 1920s scholars and the operations indicated on the left hand side of the equality sign are performed on this assumed number. Recent scholarship shows that scribes had not guessed in these situations. Exact rational number answers written in Egyptian fraction series had confused the 1920s scholars. The attested result shows that Ahmes [...] "checked" [...] result by showing that 16 + 1/2 + 1/8 exactly added to a seventh of this (which is 2 + 1/4 + 1/8), does obtain 19.
