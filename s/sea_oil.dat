40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the properties and utilization of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) and <b>sea</b> buckthorn <b>oil.</b> <b>Sea</b> Buckthorn <b>oil</b> contains wide range of substances important for health, for example vitamin E, vitamin A, carotenoids, flavonoids, sterols and essential unsaturated fatty acids. <b>Sea</b> Buckthorn <b>oil</b> is commonly used in treatment of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Its antioxidant properties are of great importance; it has UV-blocking activity and anti-aging effects. It accelerates healing of injuries and burns. In this work there are methods of thermal analysis such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG) are employed and described. These methods were used to study thermal and thermo-oxidative stability and physical-chemical behavior of the <b>sea</b> buckthorn <b>oil.</b> DSC method {{was used in the}} slow and rapid cooling regime which revealed the sensitivity of oil to the thermal history and also the fact that the resulting endotherms do not correspond to melting temperatures of <b>sea</b> buckthorn <b>oil</b> pure components. Application of TG method revealed that oxygen has only minor effect on thermo-oxidative stability; degradation of <b>sea</b> buckthorn <b>oil</b> is caused mainly by the elevated temperature...|$|R

5|$|England {{is highly}} industrialised, {{but since the}} 1970s {{there has been a}} decline in {{traditional}} heavy and manufacturing industries, and an increasing emphasis on a more service industry oriented economy. Tourism has become a significant industry, attracting millions of visitors to England each year. The export part of the economy is dominated by pharmaceuticals, cars (although many English marques are now foreign-owned, such as Land Rover, Lotus, Jaguar and Bentley), crude oil and petroleum from the English parts of North <b>Sea</b> <b>oil</b> along with Wytch Farm, aircraft engines and alcoholic beverages.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in Shetland since the Mesolithic period. The {{earliest}} written references to the islands date back to Roman times.

When Scotland {{became part of the}} Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, trade with northern Europe decreased. Fishing has continued to be an important aspect of the economy up to the present day. The discovery of North <b>Sea</b> <b>oil</b> in the 1970s significantly boosted Shetland's economy, employment and public sector revenues.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Using {{diamond saw}} wire could cut the <b>seabed</b> <b>oil</b> {{compound}} pipes. There are different advancing velocities {{according to the}} material of pipes; it makes the cutting and advancing velocities under the condition of harmony {{at the time of}} cutting the compound pipes underwater. First of all, the experiment system of diamond saw wire was set up by test cistern, equipment of diamond wire saw underwater, hydraulic pressure system, measuring and controlling system, diamond saw wire and single layer <b>seabed</b> <b>oil</b> compound pipes so on. Next, the cutting parameters, which include pipe sizing, working pressure, tensioning force of diamond saw wire, cutting velocity and advancing velocity were initialized and the first experimentation was done. Then, after adjusting the cutting parameters according to the analysis of cutting test, the next cutting experimentation underwater was done. In the end, the wearing capacity of diamond beads was measured and got the optimal advancing velocity which can minish the wearing capacity and prolong the cutting time of diamond beads. So, using these cutting parameters to cut the <b>seabed</b> <b>oil</b> compound pipes validated the feasibility of engineering application...|$|R

5|$|In the 20th century Scotland {{made a major}} {{contribution}} to the British participation in {{the two world wars}} and suffered relative economic decline, which only began to be offset with the exploitation of North <b>Sea</b> <b>Oil</b> and Gas from the 1970s and the development of new technologies and service industries. This was mirrored by a growing sense of cultural and political distinctiveness, which {{towards the end of the}} century, culminated in the establishment of a separate Scottish Parliament within the confines of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The Economy of Scotland had an {{estimated}} nominal {{gross domestic product}} (GDP) of up to £152 billion in 2015. In 2014, Scotland's per capita GDP {{was one of the}} highest in the EU. Scotland has a Western-style open mixed economy closely linked {{with the rest of the}} UK and the wider world. Traditionally, the Scottish economy has been dominated by heavy industry underpinned by shipbuilding in Glasgow, coal mining and steel industries. Petroleum related industries associated with the extraction of North <b>Sea</b> <b>oil</b> have also been important employers from the 1970s, especially in the north-east of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|There were, however, {{continuing}} gradual economic improvements, {{among the}} most visible {{of which was the}} replacement of the traditional thatched blackhouse with accommodation of a more modern design and with the assistance of Highlands and Islands Enterprise many of the islands' populations have begun to increase after decades of decline. The discovery of substantial deposits of North <b>Sea</b> <b>oil</b> in 1965 and the renewables sector have contributed to a degree of economic stability in recent decades. For example, the Arnish yard has had a chequered history but has been a significant employer in both the oil and renewables industries.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, Scotland's {{economic}} situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes. This only {{began to change}} in the 1970s, partly due to the discovery and development of North <b>Sea</b> <b>oil</b> and gas and partly as Scotland moved towards a more service-based economy. The discovery of the giant Forties oilfield in October 1970 signalled that Scotland was about to become a major oil producing nation, a view confirmed when Shell Expro discovered the giant Brent oilfield in the northern North Sea east of Shetland in 1971. Oil production started from the Argyll field (now Ardmore) in June 1975, followed by Forties in November of that year. Deindustrialisation took place rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s, as most of the traditional industries drastically shrank or were completely closed down. A new service-oriented economy emerged to replace traditional heavy industries. This included a resurgent financial services industry and the electronics manufacturing of Silicon Glen.|$|E

The Institute for Fiscal Studies reported in November 2012 that a geographic share of North <b>Sea</b> <b>oil</b> would more than cover the higher public spending, but warned that oil prices are volatile and that they are drawn from a finite resource. The Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland report for 2012/13 found that North <b>Sea</b> <b>oil</b> revenue had fallen by 41.5% and that Scotland's public spending deficit had increased from £4.6 billion to £8.6 billion.|$|E
