40|$|Private {{security}} is a multi-disciplined industry, requiring a diverse range of knowledge across many domains. Additionally and perhaps due to the diversity of private security, security has not been effectively defined. Security has many meanings dependant on applied context and concept definition. But {{security is}} developing into a discipline that does contain a rich knowledge structure, demonstrated to a degree through the increasing educational offerings of security at the tertiary level. Therefore, if security has not been appropriately defined can a security body of knowledge be presented? The study on which {{this article is based}} critiqued international tertiary security courses (n = 104) to consider what may define a security body of knowledge. Security experts selected international tertiary security courses (n = 7) to provide source data for content analysis. From these selected security courses a table of security concepts (n = 2001) was extracted, resulting in a final knowledge categorisation (n = 13) of private <b>security.</b> <b>Security</b> knowledge <b>categories</b> included the following : criminology; business continuity management; facility management; fire science; industrial security; information and computer security; investigations; physical security; security principles; risk management; security law; security management and security technology. Additionally, these <b>security</b> <b>categories</b> were integrated into previous work to propose a 2 ̆ 7 Science of Security Framework 2 ̆ 7. The development and presentation of the <b>security</b> knowledge <b>categories</b> and <b>security</b> framework will aid, in part, the consensual development of a security body of knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Working with {{existing}} multi-level-security (MLS) models reduces the usability especially when users try to transfer information to persons with different <b>security</b> <b>categories.</b> A {{main reason for}} the problems occurring with the information exchanging is that the existing MLS models assign a specific security level to documents. The assigned security level equals the highest security level of the textual content within the document. Based on the commonly used Bell LaPadula model, an extended model with an increased granularity is introduced. It is shown that users can access to parts of documents with higher security levels without causing a security compromise. This enables information exchange and it leads to an increased usability of the MLS model...|$|R
