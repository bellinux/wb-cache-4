50|$|Saracinesca {{proved to}} be both an {{immediate}} hit and Crawford's greatest critical success. It was also a commercial triumph: he negotiated separate contracts for the <b>serial</b> <b>printing</b> and the simultaneous American and British publication, as well as future royalties. He followed it with two brilliant sequels, Sant' Ilario and Don Orsino, the three of which are usually considered a trilogy. Subsequent sequels, such as Corleone, continue the saga of Saracinesca family, but with a diversion from the previous focus on the drama and status of family members into heavily plotted, incident-heavy melodrama. Characters from Saracinesca and its sequels also appear in A Lady of Rome (1906) and The White Sister (1909).|$|E
40|$|Micrometer- and nanometer-scale {{chemical}} {{patterns are}} indispensable and ubiquitous {{in a range}} of applications, such as optoelectronic devices and (bio) chemical sensors. This thesis studies chemical surface patterning utilizing polyelectrolyte multilayers for electronic and biological applications. It focuses on both fundamental study and application development in the field of layer-by-layer self-assembled composite thin films, with the goal of defining new concepts allowing for technological breakthrough. In the process of completing it, a multicomponent patterning technology that has been a bottleneck in realizing practical devices utilizing the multilayers has been developed. To achieve this goal, a multilayer transfer printing concept was applied to <b>serial</b> <b>printing</b> of individual device components. The main achievements include fundamental studies about uniform multilayer assembly of charged macromolecules on neutral hydrophobic surfaces as the principle of the technique, and the demonstration of multicomponent patterning of polyelectrolyte/nanoparticle composite thin films on a flexible substrate. (cont.) Extending the technique toward nanometer-scale patterning, a new polymeric mold material that was suitable for sub- 100 nm structuring was studied and used for chemical patterning for flow control in microfuidic devices and nanoparticle assembly for potential biological applications, combined with polyelectrolyte multilayers. by Juhyun Park.

50|$|Majority of the {{libraries}} {{these days}} are hybrid libraries. The libraries own and subscribe to different resources in different formats. Some of the common formats are ejournals, <b>serials,</b> <b>print</b> monographs, CD and DVD.

The handle system and search system are the major components that should be designed with interoperability features to search across different repositories owned by different vendors.

The need to publish serials on alkaline paper is just as great as it is for monographs. This study tested two issues from 1993 and two issues from 1988 of 546 titles for the pH level of the paper. An equal number of monographs were tested. Spearman rank order correlation coefficient was performed.

This study uses interviews and documentary techniques to collect the necessary data and analytical techniques used on stage for the provision of accounting information system that includes the provision of credit and lending requirements, organizational structure in relation to the granting of credit, documents / forms used in the provision of credit, credit granting procedures, and reports generated from lending activities.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to address the {{integration}} of SFX link resolver with Evergreen open source integrated library system (ILS). It also aims to describe a method to incorporate <b>print</b> <b>serials</b> into SFX. Design/methodology/approach - A <b>print</b> <b>serials</b> project has been proposed and implemented to integrate <b>print</b> and electronic <b>serials</b> at University of Windsor Leddy Library. It contains two sub-projects: to incorporate all forms of serials in SFX; and to integrate SFX with the Evergreen library catalogue for serials access. Various issues associated with <b>print</b> <b>serials</b> and open source software were also investigated. Findings - A unified view of <b>print</b> and electronic <b>serials</b> is desired and well received by librarians and patrons. There is no technical difficulty uploading <b>print</b> <b>serials</b> data into SFX, but the process can be time-consuming and challenging. Open source software is flexible in terms of customization and interoperability with other library systems though it presents challenges to system staff. Originality/value - This paper has the following contributions: it is the first work on the integration of Evergreen open source ILS and the proprietary link resolver, SFX, in the literature. The issues encountered and their solutions presented in this paper may be applicable to the integration of open source ILSs, such as Evergreen and Koha, with link resolvers or other library systems; and the method described in this paper to facilitate users in accessing all forms of serials may be useful for other institutions having SFX or other link resolver systems...|$|R
