5|$|In 1643, Governor Winthrop became {{embroiled in}} a {{controversy}} over the propriety of taking sides in a power struggle going on in neighbouring French Acadia. Endecott pointed out that he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> the French fight amongst themselves without English involvement, as this would weaken them both. The 1644 governor's election became a referendum on Winthrop's policy; Endecott was elected governor, with Winthrop as his deputy. During his one-year term he oversaw {{the division of the}} colony into four counties: Suffolk, Essex, Middlesex, and Norfolk. The ascent of the Salem-based Endecott also prompted an attempt by other Salem residents to have the colonial capital relocated there; the attempt was rejected by the governor's council of assistants.|$|E
500|$|Skinner takes Mulder's defense, while Scully, Doggett, Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka) and Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) testify on Mulder's behalf. The {{prosecution}} presents Rohrer's body {{as evidence}} against Mulder. Aware that Rohrer is a seemingly-invincible [...] "Super Soldier", Scully performs an unauthorized [...] medical examination and {{proves that the}} body is not that of Rohrer. Despite this, the evidence is rejected and the defense overruled, and Mulder is sentenced to death {{for the murder of}} a military officer. Later, Doggett, Skinner, Reyes, and Scully help Mulder escape, with the unexpected help of Kersh who decided he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> Mulder go in the first place. Despite being advised to immediately leave the continent via Canada, Mulder instead takes Scully to New Mexico. On their way, Mulder receives a visit by three additional ghosts: The Lone Gunmen, who advise him to flee for his life rather than continue his pursuit of the truth. Mulder politely declines. Meanwhile, Doggett and Reyes find their office emptied, suggesting that the X-Files have been closed down for the third time.|$|E
500|$|Stone gave Charlie Sheen {{the choice}} of Jack Lemmon or Martin Sheen to play his father in the film, and Sheen picked his father. The elder Sheen related to the moral sense of his character. Stone cast Daryl Hannah as Bud Fox's materialistic girlfriend Darien Taylor, but {{felt that she was}} never happy with the role and did not know why she {{accepted}} it. He tried to explain the character to Hannah repeatedly, and thought that the materialism of the character conflicted with Hannah's idealism. Stone said later that he was aware early on that she was not right for the part. [...] "Daryl Hannah was not happy doing the role and I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> her go. All my crew {{wanted to get rid of}} her after one day of shooting. My pride was such that I kept saying I was going to make it work". Stone also had difficulties with Sean Young, who made her opinions known that Hannah should be fired and that she should play that role instead. Young would show up to the set late and unprepared. She did not get along with Charlie Sheen, which caused further friction on the set. In retrospect, Stone felt that Young was right and he should have swapped Hannah's role with hers. Stone admits that he had [...] "some problems" [...] with Young, but was not willing to confirm or deny rumors that she walked off with all of her costumes when she completed filming.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Brown criticized President Obama for {{responding}} to Hurricane Sandy faster than he responded to the attacks at Benghazi. [...] He also stated {{that he thought that}} President Obama was overplaying the likely threat from Sandy, and that the storm had hardly formed. [...] He also noted “The storm was still forming, people were debating whether {{it was going to be}} as bad as expected, or not, and I noted that the president <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> the governors and mayors deal with the storm until it got closer to hitting the coastal areas along the Washington, D.C.-New York City corridor.” ...|$|E

Who shows up in Chinatown? None other than the Evil Queen, who claims “Regina never <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> me out to play.” And this is a war now. You thought the Big Bad for season 6 was Hyde? Try Dark Regina instead. And yes, I’m into it. Lana Parrilla {{is one of the best}} things about this show, and I’ll take {{anything}} that gives her a chance to flex her acting chops." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hoover {{began his}} magnum opus Freedom Betrayed in 1944 {{as part of}} a {{proposed}} autobiography. This turned into a significant work critiquing the foreign policy of the United States during the period from the 1930s to 1945. Essentially an attack on the statesmanship of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Hoover completed this work in his 90th year but it was not published until the historian George H. Nash took on the task of editing it. Significant themes are his belief that the western democratic powers <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia assail and weaken each other, and opposition to the British guarantee of Poland's independence.

2500|$|However, Heaven {{had already}} favored someone else, and his chance was over. [...] He {{was at least}} more {{fortunate}} than Chen She. [...] He {{was the first to}} rise in rebellion but was finally willing to surrender to others. [...] Did he not know that this put him in great danger? [...] Further, he could not actually submit, contributing his abilities to serve the emperor, and he finally rebelled, becoming only a madman. [...] He did not accept Wang Bodang's words, and he finally suffered disaster at Taolin. [...] Some have compared him to Xiang Yu. [...] Even if he had sufficient civil and military abilities to match, he was far more lacking in bravery and decisiveness. [...] If Yang Su had favored Li Mi's abilities, he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> Li Mi be a servant of the emperor, but instead he gave Li Mi to his idiotic son , finally leading to the slaughter of his house. [...] How was that appropriate? ...|$|E
2500|$|The main way {{contracts}} {{are brought to}} an untimely end is when one party does not perform the major primary obligations on {{their side of the}} bargain. As a rule, if a breach is small the other party must still go ahead and perform his obligations, but will then be able to claim compensation, or a [...] "secondary obligation" [...] from the party in breach. If, however, the breach is very big, [...] "fundamental" [...] or goes [...] "to the root of the contract", then the innocent party gets the right to elect to terminate his own performance for the future. The same goes where one party makes clear they have no intention of performing their side of the bargain, in an [...] "anticipatory repudiation", so the innocent party can go straight to court to claim a remedy, rather than waiting till the contract's date for performance which never arrives. The test for whether a term's breach will allow for termination essentially depends on construction of the contract's terms as a whole by the court, following the same rules as for any other term. In Bettini v Gye, Blackburn J held that although an opera singer arrived 4 days late for rehearsals, given that the contract was to last three and a half months, and only the first week of performance would be slightly affected, the Opera House owner was not entitled to turn the singer away. The opera owner could have withheld some payment to reflect his loss from the breach, but <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> the show go on. The intentions of the parties manifested in the contract showed that such a breach was not so serious as to give rise to the right to terminate. As Lord Wilberforce said in The Diana Prosperity the Court must, 'place itself in thought in the same factual matrix as that in which the parties were.' ...|$|E
