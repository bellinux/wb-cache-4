40|$|This {{research}} project examined objective measures of driver behaviour and road users' perceptions on the usefulness {{and effectiveness of}} three specific VMS (Variable Message Signs) interventions to improve <b>speeding</b> <b>and</b> headway behaviours. The interventions addressed speeding behaviour alone (intervention 1), headway behaviour alone (intervention 2) and a combination of <b>speeding</b> <b>and</b> headway behaviour (intervention 3). Six VMS were installed along {{a segment of the}} Bruce Highway, with a series of three signs for each of the northbound <b>and</b> southbound traffic. <b>Speeds</b> <b>and</b> headway distances were measured with loop detectors installed before and after each VMS. Messages addressing <b>speeding</b> <b>and</b> headway were devised for display on the VMS. A driver could receive a message if they were detected as exceeding the posted speed limit (of 90 km/hr) or if the distance to the vehicle in front was less than 2. 0 s. In addition to the on-road objective measurement of <b>speeding</b> <b>and</b> headway behaviours, the {{research project}} elicited self-reported responses to the <b>speeding</b> <b>and</b> headway messages from a sample of drivers via a community-based survey. The survey sought to examine the drivers' beliefs about the effectiveness of the signs and messages, and their views about the role, use, and effectiveness of VMS more generally...|$|R

5|$|As enemies {{accumulate}} in the arena, {{the amount of}} safe space decreases. This, alongside the enemies' aggressive behaviour, encourages constant player movement and spatial awareness. The player character can move at high <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> jump to perform evasive manoeuvres. The game employs advanced movement techniques to increase player <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> jump height. The player can gain a speed boost by strafing while jumping. The shotgun-like blast can supplement the jumping mechanism; the player can be propelled further and perform a double jump by firing downwards while still in the air.|$|E
5|$|Barkley also possessed {{considerable}} defensive talents led by {{an aggressive}} demeanor, foot <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> his capacity to read the floor to anticipate for steals, a reason why he established his career as the second All-Time leader in steals for the power forward position {{and leader of the}} highest all-time steal per game average for the power forward position. Despite being undersized for both the small forward and power forward positions, he also finished among the all-time leaders in blocked shots.

5|$|Burst {{frequency}} offset (BFO) – {{the difference between}} the expected and received frequency of transmissions. The difference is caused by Doppler shifts as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU that results from drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the uplink. This measure can be analysed to determine the aircraft's <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> heading, but multiple combinations of <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> heading can be valid solutions.|$|E
5|$|Data error {{optimisation}} – Candidate paths varied <b>speed</b> <b>and</b> heading at each handshake to minimise {{the error}} between the calculated BFO of that path versus the actual BFO recorded from Flight 370.

This paper reports a questionnaire survey in China, {{focusing on the}} effect of Big-Five factors on <b>speeding,</b> drink driving, <b>and</b> distracted driving while Akers' social learning theory and Homel's deterrence theory were applied. The results showed that personalities had significant effect on <b>speeding</b> <b>and</b> drink driving; social factors had significant effect on <b>speeding</b> <b>and</b> distracted driving; deterrence had significant effect on <b>speeding</b> <b>and</b> drink driving; however, social learning theory did not contribute to drink driving; deterrence did not affect distracted driving.

5|$|Early Islamic {{philosophers}} initially {{agreed with}} the Aristotelian view that light had no speed of travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite <b>speed,</b> <b>and</b> that {{the speed of light}} is variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from our senses. Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī agreed that light has a finite <b>speed,</b> <b>and</b> observed that the speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound.|$|E
