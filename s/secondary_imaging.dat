40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONVisually isoattenuating {{pancreatic}} adenocarcinoma {{is defined}} as a mass not directly visible on CT and recognizable only by <b>secondary</b> <b>imaging</b> signs. The frequency of isoattenuating pancreatic adenocarcinomas at dynamic-enhanced CT has been reported to range from 5. 4 % to 14 %. Furthermore, 80 % of the visually isoattenuating pancreatic adenocarcinomas are detectable in dynamic-enhanced MRI. Consequently, a pancreatic adenocarcinoma undetected in both the above imaging studies is an exceptionally rare event. PRESENTATION OF CASEThe present report describes a case of a histologically proved 3. 5 cm pancreatic adenocarcinoma undetected in both dynamic-enhanced CT and MRI. The patient presented with progressive jaundice over the preceding 20 days. Initial abdominal CT showed a dilated pancreatic and common bile duct without demonstration of a lesion responsible for the clinical and imaging findings. Additional diagnostic work-up with dynamic CT and dynamic MRI failed to reveal a definitive mass. ERCP revealed an irregular interruption of the pancreatic and distal common bile duct with upstream dilation. Blind radical pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. Histologic examination showed a pT 3 pN 1 MO pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the head/neck. DISCUSSIONIsoattenuating pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients represent a small but meaningful subset of patients with pancreatic cancer, as they have better survival. The more favorable postsurgical survival makes it even more imperative to correctly diagnose their cases at early stages by obtaining further diagnostic work-up with dynamic pancreatic CT, dynamic MRI and endoscopic ultrasound. CONCLUSIONWhen the above studies fail to unmask the lesion, blind pancreaticoduodenectomy should be based on strong clinical suspicion and <b>secondary</b> <b>imaging</b> findings...|$|E

Despite a lack of robust validation in the literature, computed tomography (CT) is often used as <b>secondary</b> <b>imaging.</b> PurposeTo assess the frequency and clinical utility of non-cortical skeletal and soft tissue lesions as ancillary fracture signs in CT diagnosis of occult hip fractures. Material and MethodsAll fracture signs (cortical and trabecular fractures, bone bruise, joint effusion, and lipohemarthrosis) were recorded in 231 hip low-energy trauma cases with CT performed after normal or equivocal radiography in two trauma centers. ResultsThere were no fracture signs in 110 patients. Twelve of these had a joint effusion. In 121 patients with 46 cervical hip fractures and 75 trochanteric fractures one or more fracture signs were present. Cortical fractures were found in 115 patients. Bone bruise was found in 119 patients, joint effusion in 35, and lipohemarthrosis in 20 patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Radiography {{alone will}} not detect all {{scaphoid}} fractures. There is a reported prevalence between 9 and 33 % of occult scaphoid fractures. The evidence-based literature suggests that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most suitable <b>secondary</b> <b>imaging</b> modality due {{to the ability to}} evaluate the bone marrow directly and to also identify other injuries. However, there is no consensus on the choice of follow-up imaging strategy-computed tomography, MRI, or bone scan-across different institutions. Tomosynthesis is a new digital tomographic method creating multiple thin tomographic sections. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the clinical utility of tomosynthesis in suspected occult fracture. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with a clinically suspected occult scaphoid fracture after initial normal radiography were imaged with repeat radiography and tomosynthesis scan 2 weeks after trauma. RESULTS: Repeat radiography revealed one previously undetected scaphoid tubercle avulsion and one scaphoid waist fracture, confirmed by tomosynthesis. Tomosynthesis revealed two additional scaphoid waist fractures. In total, three initially occult scaphoid waist fractures were detected (9 %). No additional fractures were detected in the remaining 32 patients during a 1 -year follow-up. CONCLUSION: Tomosynthesis can demonstrate occult scaphoid fractures not visible at radiography...|$|E

In our Neurovascular Center we analyzed 372 patients with non traumatic SAH over a 14 -years period. We used CT or CTA followed by DSA to confirm the diagnosis. Secondary examinations, either secondary cerebral angiographies or MR-Angiographies, were reviewed to examine the detection of sources of the SAH during these studies. Repeated DSA demonstrated no causative vascular lesions in all 43 patients (31 with perimesencephalic and 12 with non perimesencephalic SAH). Only by one Patient (1, 1 %) was the secondary DSA positive. Seven patients (4 with perimesencephalic and 3 with non perimesencephalic SAH) received an MRA as secondary diagnostic. None of the MRAs showed pathological vessels. 16 patients (16 %) were lost to follow-up. Repeated DSA should only be necessary in cases with vasospasms and limited sensitivity during initial DSA. Therefore, we believe that repeated DSA should not be recommended as standard procedure in patients with both perimesencephalic and non perimesencephalic SAH after initially negative imaging diagnostics.

40|$|International audienceOnline {{control of}} the range during {{particle}} therapy {{is one of the}} challenges for substantial improvement of the treatment quality. Most of the methods under study rely on the measurement of secondary radiations generated by nuclear reactions (PET imaging [1], prompt gamma <b>imaging</b> [2] or <b>secondary</b> particle <b>imaging</b> for carbon-therapy [3]). In some cases, in addition to the <b>secondary</b> radiation <b>imaging</b> device, a beam monitor is required to register the transverse position of the beam and/or the precise arrival time of particles, or bunches of particles [4].

Both breast MRI and molecular breast imaging (MBI) have been used as <b>secondary</b> <b>imaging</b> techniques. However, breast MRI suffers from low specificity and low sensitivity in MBI. A CZT based detector system has been developed with the goal of simultaneous MBI/MRI imaging to address the shortcomings of each modality. The performance of each modality needs to be addressed separately and together. The CZT system is comprised of four Redlen CZT modules tiled in a 2 x 2 array. Each module consists of 256 pixels and feature a builtin on-board ASIC and FPGA. A custom digital readout circuit board was designed to interface the four modules with a microcontroller to a PC. MR images were acquired with a 3 T GE Discovery MR 750 and Hologic breast coils. A gradient echo imaging sequence was used for all image acquisitions. A tissue mimicking phantom with a plastic grid insert (1 cm spacing) was used to evaluate geometric accuracy with the CZT detectors in the MRI bore. The average distance between the grid markers was 1 Å} 0.2 cm indicating negligible geometric distortion. Field maps were generated with a uniform phantom to quantify the effect on magnetic field homogeneity. Early results indicate a significant distortion (~ 10 ppm) in the magnetic field closest to the coil. Further analysis of the MR images will determine the extent of image quality degradation. A flood map of Tc- 99 m was acquired to evaluate and implement an energy correction map and a uniformity map. In the absence of a magnetic field, the mean energy resolution at 140 keV was 6.3 %.

The development of these alloys {{was part of an}} ongoing effort to develop and discover a new materials system capable of replacing nickel based super alloys. Additions of titanium were found to provide limited oxidation resistance. A discontinuous layer of TiO 2 was observed to from at temperatures above 1100 °C. Alloys containing titanium additions were observed to suffer from pest oxidation at low and intermediate temperatures due to the development of Nb 2 O 5. Poor oxidation resistance at intermediate temperatures for alloys with titanium additions was attributed to a transformation in the structure of Nb 2 O 5 formed. Additions of chromium were observed to increase oxidation resistance through the development of a layered oxide structure containing SiO 2 and CrNbO 4. An intermediate oxidation layer was observed to develop along the oxide metal interface in which the solid solution was not oxidized. These alloys were found to be susceptible to pest oxidation at intermediate and low oxidation temperatures between 700 and 1000 °C.

Quaternary alloy Nb- 5 Re- 5 Si- 5 Cr has Nb 5 Si 3, NbCr 2 and NbSS.

The continued work was to develop and discover a new materials system capable of replacing nickel based super alloys. Additions of aluminum were found to provide limited oxidation resistance. A discontinuous layer of Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 was observed to form at all temperatures adapted for this study. Alloy containing aluminum additions were observed to suffer from pest oxidation at intermediate temperatures due to the development of Nb 2 O 5. Poor oxidation resistance at intermediate temperatures for alloys with aluminum additions was attributed to a transformation in the structure of Nb 2 O 5 formed. Pesting was observed at 900 °C, consuming the metal completely. Additions of chromium were observed to increase oxidation resistance through the development of a layered oxide structure containing SiO 2 and CrNbO 4. Internal oxidation layer was observed to develop oxides {{in the midst of the}} phases formed. ^ Boron addition has helped in the formation of the 3, 5 silicides, NbSS, and Laves phase. The combination of oxides of Nb 2 O 5, CrNbO 4 and SiO 2 has helped improve the oxidation resistance of the alloy. Rhenium in this alloy has been a major element in terms of forming Re-oxides which has resulted in the negative weight gain. Alloys with this type of weight gain is advantageous as it refers to nullifying the formation of bulky Nb 2 O 5. There was no metal left at 1400 °C. Pesting was no observed at low temperature range. However, spalling was noticed at 1200 and 1300 °C. ^ Tungsten additions have helped in the formation of Nb 5 Si 3, Cr 2 Re 3, NbCr 2, and NbSS. All the phases formed were intermetallics, except the solid solution. These high temperature phases have helped to resist oxidation to an extent. The formation of a CrNbO 4 and SiO 2 has helped in lowering the oxidation kinetics. No pesting was observed, spalling of the oxide was noticed only at 1300 °C.

30|$|Charging-free {{images with}} good {{contrast}} and resolution {{have been obtained}} working with the ESEM modality at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV and at gas pressures (water vapor) of 200 – 220 Pa. We have also achieved a good resolution with <b>secondary</b> electron (SE) <b>imaging</b> by adopting the FIB as a primary beam and at the lowest ion current (1 pA).|$|R
40|$|We reveal {{nanoscale}} {{information of}} semi-crystalline polypropyl-ene {{with the use}} of a new secondary electron hyperspectral imag-ing technique. The innovative combination of cryo-SEM and low voltage allows for the optimised imaging of these beam-sensitive materials. Through the collection of <b>secondary</b> electron hyper-spectral <b>imaging</b> data mapping of molecular order on the nano-scale in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) can be achieved...|$|R
