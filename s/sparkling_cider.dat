[...] Some 262 couples obtained licenses, starting with Marcia Hams and Susan Shepherd. The first to wed in Cambridge were Tanya McCloskey and Marcia Kadish at 9:15a.m. Cambridge City Clerk Margaret Drury was the first City Clerk in the U.S. to perform a same-sex marriage. Massachusetts has a three-day waiting period before issuing marriage licenses, but many couples obtained waivers of the waiting period in order to be wed as soon as possible.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} yeast strain and aging {{time on the}} {{chemical}} composition, analytical, and sensory foam properties of <b>sparkling</b> <b>ciders</b> has been studied. The analytical foam parameters (foamability, HM; Bikerman coefficient, ∑; and foam stability time, Ts) were significantly influenced by aging and yeast strain. The sensory attributes (initial foam, foam area persistence, bubble size, foam collar, and overall foam quality) improved with aging time. Likewise, the yeast strain positively influenced the assessment of initial foam, foam area persistence, number of bubble chains, and overall foam quality. Significant and positive correlations were found between alcoholic proof, dry extract, total and volatile acidities, total phenols and total proteins, and ∑, whereas HM was negatively correlated with specific gravity, alcoholic proof, dry extract, and total proteins...|$|R

50|$|Gruyère {{cheese is}} {{generally}} {{known as one}} of the finest cheeses for baking, having a distinctive but not overpowering taste. In quiche, Gruyère adds savoriness without overshadowing the other ingredients. It is a good melting cheese, particularly suited for fondues, along with Vacherin and Emmental. It is also traditionally used in French onion soup, as well as in croque-monsieur, a classic French toasted ham and cheese sandwich. Gruyère is also used in chicken and veal cordon bleu. It is a fine table cheese, and when grated, it is often used with salads and pastas. It is used, grated, atop le tourin, a type of garlic soup from France which is served on dried bread. White wines, such as Riesling, pair well with Gruyère. <b>Sparkling</b> apple <b>cider</b> and Bock beer are also beverage affinities.|$|R

50|$|The flavour of cider varies. Ciders can be {{classified}} from dry to sweet. Their appearance ranges from cloudy with sediment to completely clear, and their colour ranges from almost clear to amber to brown. The variations in clarity and colour are mostly due to filtering between pressing and fermentation. Some apple varieties will produce a clear cider without any need for filtration. Both <b>sparkling</b> and still <b>ciders</b> are made; the sparkling variety is the more common.|$|R
50|$|For larger-scale cider production, ciders from vats {{produced}} from different varieties of apple {{may be blended}} to accord with market taste. If the cider is to be bottled, usually some extra sugar is added for <b>sparkle.</b> Higher quality <b>ciders</b> can be made using the champagne method, but this is expensive in time and money and requires special corks, bottles, and other equipment. Some home brewers use beer bottles, which work perfectly well, and are inexpensive. This allows the cider to become naturally carbonated.|$|R

40|$|Autolytic {{activity}} {{and the production of}} several major volatile compounds were studied for a set of 18 commercial and non-commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiæ strains isolated from <b>sparkling</b> wine, <b>cider</b> and sherry fermentations. No correlation was found between the autolytic capacity of the strains and isobutanol production levels, in contrast with results published by other authors for a limited number of S. cerevisiæ strains. The 18 strains were classified in three groups by cluster analysis; the variables that best discriminated the groups were related with autolysis, with a limited effect of the volatile compounds. All the commercial sparkling wine second fermentation strains appeared in the same group, which was characterized by the release of high amounts of proteins under conditions of accelerated autolysis. This could probably be explained by an indirect selection for efficient autolysis for these commercial strains. Most sherry and cider isolates appeared in a single group. Interestingly, one strain isolated from cider fermentation is grouped with sparkling wine commercial strains.

Many African Americans and Southerners serve baked macaroni and cheese and collard greens, along with chitterlings and sweet potato pie, while some Italian-Americans often have lasagne on the table and Ashkenazi Jews may serve noodle kugel, a sweet dessert pudding. Other Jewish families may consume foods commonly associated with Hanukkah, such as latkes or a sufganiyah; the two holidays are usually in close proximity and on extremely rare occasions overlap. It is not unheard of for Mexican Americans to serve their turkey with mole and roasted corn. In Puerto Rico, the Thanksgiving meal is completed with arroz con gandules (rice with pigeon peas) or arroz con maiz (rice with corn), pasteles (root tamales) stuffed with turkey, pumpkin-coconut crème caramel, corn bread with longaniza, potato salad, roasted white sweet potatoes and Spanish <b>sparkling</b> hard <b>cider.</b> Turkey in Puerto Rico is stuffed with mofongo. Cuban-Americans traditionally serve the turkey alongside a small roasted pork and include white rice and black beans or kidney beans.

40|$|Early 1900 ’s, Kastner, a German brewing scientist, {{reported}} a strong foam and beer overflow after opening normal beer bottles without shaking. This unwanted {{phenomenon known as}} gushing was also described later in other CO 2 supersaturated beverages (champagne, <b>sparkling</b> wine, <b>cider,</b> soda, mineral water) but seems to be most relevant in beer. Gushing represents severe economic losses and bad brand image. In the 1960 - 1970 s, some causes of this phenomenon were proposed and a fungal contamination of raw material by molds such as Fusarium sp. was suggested but molecules responsible remained unknown. In the 1990 s an amphiphilic peptide produced by filamentous fungi (Ascomycetes) was discovered and was called hydrophobin by Wessels et al. {{on the base of}} its amino-acids sequence. At the end of the 1990 s hydrophobins were tackled as the major responsible molecules for primary gushing by a research group in Finland but the mechanisms remained unexplained. More practically, Casey (1996) submitted the hypothesis that some organic materials formed a solid pellicle around CO 2 gas without explaining how and why. Still later research was intensified in Germany, Japan, Finland and other countries. Due to agricultural practice (grain humidity at harvest) and malting practice (germination temperature), the economic damages caused by gushing become more and more frequent (from one or two times pro decade earlier till three or four times pro decade now). Finally, the missing piece of the puzzle was added by Deckers et al. (2010) making the link between gaseous CO 2 (hydrophobic gas) and hydrophobins (hydrophobic patch) and by introducing the concept of “nanobombs”. Hydrophobins form a crystalline layer around CO 2 nanobubbles resulting in the appearance of surpressurized nanobubbles in a closed bottle. At opening of the bottle these surpressurized nanobubbles will explode due to their contact with the atmospheric pressure. This explosion generates the energy required for the formation of nucleation sites allowing some dissolved CO 2 to escape under an uncontrolled bubble form. Considering the physico-chemical properties of both hydrophobins and CO 2 at atmospheric pressure allowed us to develop a new predictive method for primary gushing applicable to all the production steps, starting from barley till bottled beer (2011). The understanding of this mechanism allows us to bring a definitive solution to a worldwide beer sickness. status: publishe...|$|R
