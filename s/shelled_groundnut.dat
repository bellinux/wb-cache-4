40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of <b>groundnut</b> <b>shell</b> were investigated based on varying volume of shell and Urea formaldehyde. Tensile and compressive composite samples were produced from aluminium mould. The material {{used for the}} work were dried grinded <b>groundnut</b> <b>shell,</b> Urea formaldehyde (uf), digital weighing scale, mould material, metallic sieve, electric oven and lubricating oil. Several proportions by volume of shell and Urea formaldehyde was tested which gave yield strength of 41. 56 mpa, 46, 35 mpa; 39. 27 mpa, 43. 20 mpa; 41. 14 mpa, 49. 08 mpa; 35. 22 mpa, 40. 21 mpa; 29. 93 mpa, 35. 09 mpa with a compressive strength of 89. 27 mpa, 94. 37 mpa; 72. 38 mpa, 82. 51 mpa; 80. 65 mpa, 92. 51 mpa; 64 [...] 34 mpa, 74. 22 mpa; 59. 48 mpa, 68. 64 mpa, was achieved. An established value of 12 % volume of shell plus 79 g of urea formaldehyde in the sample gave the best or optimum composite material for application as a particle board or roofing material. Beyond the established value, the strength of sample begins to diminish. It can therefore be inferred that, <b>groundnut</b> <b>shell</b> can be use for low strength application in the building industry most likely as a particle board, roofing sheet and panel board. This material is, light in weight, and resistant to corrosion. The addition of fillers to the shell, e. g. Wood dust or calcium carbonate would improve the composite adhesion; likewise reduction of high grams of Urea in the solution to appropriate ratio may improve adhesion greatly, hence increasing {{the strength of the}} composite...|$|R
40|$|<b>Groundnut</b> <b>shell</b> (GS), after {{separation}} of pod, {{is readily available}} as a potential feedstock for production of fermentable sugars. The substrate was delignified with sodium sulfite. The delignified substrate released 670 mg/g of sugars after enzymatic hydrolysis (50 degrees C, 120 rpm, 50 hrs) using commercial cellulases (Dyadic Xylanase PLUS, Dyadic Inc. USA). The <b>groundnut</b> <b>shell</b> enzymatic hydrolysate (45. 6 g/L reducing sugars) was fermented for ethanol production with free and sorghum stalks immobilized cells of Pichia stipitis NCIM 3498 under submerged cultivation conditions. Immobilization of yeast cells on sorghum stalks were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A maximum of ethanol production (17. 83 g/L, yield 0. 44 g/g and 20. 45 g/L, yield 0. 47 g/g) was observed with free and immobilized cells of P. stipitis respectively in batch fermentation conditions. Recycling of immobilized cells showed a stable ethanol production (20. 45 g/L, yield 0. 47 g/g) up to 5 batches followed by a gradual downfall in subsequent cycles.

40|$|Ten {{agricultural}} wastes in Nigeria {{were subjected to}} ultimate and proximate analyses to determine their energy content using the method of Association of Official Analytical Chemists. The samples are: <b>groundnut</b> <b>shell,</b> yam peels, coconut shell, mango peels, palm oil mill effluents, corn cob, cherry, orange peels, melon shell, and black walnut hull. Results of analysis show that the mean higher heating values of the waste samples are 16505 kJ/kg, 19597 kJ/kg, 20647 kJ/kg, 15891 kJ/kg, 17303 kJ/kg, 19458 kJ/kg, 28203 kJ/kg, 19299 kJ/kg, 21392 kJ/kg and 21143 kJ/kg for <b>groundnut</b> <b>shell,</b> yam peels, coconut shell, mango peels, palm oil mill effluent, corn cob, cherry, orange peels, melon shell and black walnut hull respectively. All the waste samples considered have heat values greater than some well-known biomass-fuels and fall within the limit {{for the production of}} steam in electricity generation. As a result of this, it is envisaged that industries that use their waste biomass for energy would simultaneously solve a waste disposal problem and save money on their energy needs...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of sandcrete blocks using <b>groundnut</b> <b>shell</b> ash (GSA) as cement replacement was investigated. Six number sandcrete blocks were cast for each replacement levels (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 percentage) with GSA. The blocks were cured and crushed at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. The {{results show that}} the compressive strength ranges from 4. 50 N/mm 2 to 0. 26 N/mm 2. The optimum replacement level was achieved at 20...|$|R
50|$|The {{universal}} nut sheller {{has been}} less than successful in Ghana. First hand accounts relate almost universal breakage. Users can mitigate this breakage by pouring the nuts through initially at very broad settings and only later at finer settings, this practice does not eliminate the breakage and destroys the efficiency aspect. <b>Groundnut</b> <b>shelling</b> {{tends to be a}} social activity everyone engages in during their down time and there is rarely a need for a peanut sheller.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{were conducted}} to characterize the thermal insulation properties of different natu-ral low-cost materials (coconut fi bers and <b>groundnut</b> <b>shell).</b> A steady state method {{was used to measure}} the thermal conductivity by holding the sample between two concentric spheres with heat transferred mainly by conduction from the inner sphere (heat source) through the testing material. For comparison, the same experi-mental procedure was done for a standard and man-made insulation material, aluminum silicate fi ber. The results showed that for all the materials, the thermal conductivity increases with temperature; and the rates of increase are very similar. Also, two experimental samples were made to measure the moisture transport of the two natural materials: one with <b>groundnut</b> <b>shell</b> (composed of void space and grain) and the other sample with coconut fi bers (composed of void space and fi bers). The percentage of water accumulation due to vapor absorp-tion was calculated for each layer after a pre-set time of experiment (1 h, 2 h, …). A numerical investigation was performed to simulate the transfer process with a general and sound model, and to present the basic features of the transfer process...|$|R
