NRK also directly invited composers to submit songs for the contest, {{as they did in}} 2007. All entries had to be received by NRK by 1 September. Composers of all nationalities were again welcome in the competition, despite the controversy that has arisen in recent years over the number of songs written by Swedish composers that {{can be found in the}} competition. However NRK said that they support songs composed by Norwegians, but that they would <b>still</b> <b>like</b> to open the contest to foreign composers, hence all entries were under consideration.|$|E

Unlike the Chilean variety, Peruvian pisco is never diluted {{after it is}} distilled and enters the bottle directly at its distillation strength. The production of a regular Peruvian Pisco bottle requires 8 kilograms of grapes, and a Mosto Verde variety needs 12 kg.|$|R

500|$|Iyall {{released}} a solo album entitled Strange Language with former band members Bossi and Smith in 1986. Afterward she pursued {{a career as}} an art teacher. The band reunited briefly for a live performance in 1993. In 2004, Romeo Void was featured on an episode of VH1's Bands Reunited. Bossi had sustained too much hearing damage {{over the years and}} was unable to perform, although he did meet up with the band again and observed the reunion performance in an adjacent room. Iyall has continued to dabble in music related projects and events. [...] "I <b>still</b> <b>like</b> to sing and I <b>still</b> <b>like</b> to perform," [...] she said. In 2003 she was involved in a musical project called Knife in Water. She began collaborating with Peter Dunne, who was known as Peter [...] when he played guitar for Pearl Harbor and the Explosions. Iyall and Dunne performed at a support benefit for Crawdaddy! founder Paul Williams in June 2009, and performed at a concert honoring 415 Records later that September.

500|$|In 2001, Chabon {{reflected}} {{on the success of}} his first novel by saying that while [...] "the upside was that I was published and I got a readership, ... downside ... was that, emotionally, this stuff started happening and I was <b>still</b> <b>like,</b> 'Wait a minute, is my thesis done yet?' It took me a few years to catch up." [...] In 1991, Chabon published A Model World, a collection of short stories, many of which had been published previously in The New Yorker.|$|E
500|$|Publishers Weekly {{thought the}} book [...] "full of holes, as if its raison d'etre were {{to set up}} the action for future books". Like The Guardian, PW commented on the slow start but noted the pace picked up once the Colony was reached. [...] School Library Journal wrote that after a slow start, [...] "the pace picks up", and praised the plot twists and the setting. Kirkus Review wrote [...] "ense but exciting" [...] and Booklist thought [...] " [...] appears to be a very {{promising}} series kickoff". The Horn Book Review felt readers [...] "may lose patience with the slow beginning", but observed that adventure lovers would <b>still</b> <b>like</b> the plot.|$|E
500|$|McCartney played lead guitar {{on several}} Beatles recordings, {{including}} what MacDonald {{described as a}} [...] "fiercely angular slide guitar solo" [...] on [...] "Drive My Car", which McCartney played on an Epiphone Casino. McCartney said of the instrument, [...] "if I had to pick one electric guitar it would be this." [...] He contributed what MacDonald described as [...] "a startling guitar solo" [...] on the Harrison composition [...] "Taxman" [...] and the [...] "shrieking" [...] guitar on [...] "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" [...] and [...] "Helter Skelter". MacDonald also praised McCartney's [...] "coruscating pseudo-Indian" [...] guitar solo on [...] "Good Morning Good Morning". McCartney also played lead guitar on [...] "Another Girl". While in Wings, McCartney tended to leave electric guitar work to other group members, though he played most of the lead guitar on Band on the Run. In 1990, when asked who his favourite guitar players were he included Eddie Van Halen, Eric Clapton and David Gilmour, stating, [...] "but I <b>still</b> <b>like</b> Hendrix the best". He has primarily used a Gibson Les Paul for electric work, particularly during live performances.|$|E

500|$|In early 1993, Roxette {{became the}} first non-native-English {{speaking}} artists to be featured on MTV's Unplugged series, though the songs from the performance were never released on an official Unplugged album. In the same year, Roxette recorded and released [...] "Almost Unreal", a song originally slated for the film Hocus Pocus starring Bette Midler. However, the song {{was moved to the}} soundtrack of the film based on the Nintendo video game Super Mario Bros. Supported by an expensive video and ultimately receiving respectable airplay, [...] "Almost Unreal" [...] managed to briefly reach {{the lower end of the}} Billboard Hot 100 but charted highest in the UK reaching the top 10, the group's first time there since [...] "Joyride" [...] two years before. Roxette themselves were dismissive about the song, with Fredriksson saying it was [...] "not one of our most inspired moments." [...] On the other hand, Gessle stated: [...] "I <b>still</b> <b>like</b> the song in a way... but if you wanted to make a parody of Roxette, it would probably sound something like this." [...] To coincide with the UK television premiere of the film Pretty Woman, [...] "It Must Have Been Love" [...] was re-issued in September 1993 and entered the UK and Irish singles charts for the second time.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Nirvana's success, Michael Azerrad wrote in a 1992 Rolling Stone article, Smells Like Teen Spirit' is an anthem for (or is it against?) the 'Why Ask Why?' generation. Just don't call Cobain a {{spokesman}} for a generation." [...] Nevertheless, the music press awarded the song an [...] "anthem-of-a-generation" [...] status, placing Cobain as a reluctant spokesman for Generation X. The New York Times observed that Smells Like Teen Spirit' could be this generation’s version of the Sex Pistols' 1976 single, 'Anarchy in the U.K.', if it weren’t for the bitter irony that pervades its title," [...] and added, [...] "As Nirvana knows only too well, teen spirit is routinely bottled, shrink-wrapped and sold." [...] The band grew uncomfortable with the song's success, and in later concerts often pointedly excluded it from the set list. Prior {{to the release of}} the band's 1993 follow-up album In Utero, Novoselic remarked, [...] "If it wasn't for 'Teen Spirit' I don't know how Nevermind would have done," [...] and observed, [...] "There are no 'Teen Spirits' on In Utero." [...] Cobain said in 1994, [...] "I <b>still</b> <b>like</b> playing 'Teen Spirit,' but it's almost an embarrassment to play it [...] Everyone has focused on that song so much." ...|$|E

2500|$|Whilst {{working on}} this new material, the band {{embarked}} upon a ten-year [...] "anniversary tour", celebrating the release of their third studio album, Clarity. Vocalist and guitarist Jim Adkins states that the tour {{did not have a}} direct influence on the forthcoming material but notes that [...] "it was an overall confidence booster because it's kind of an amazing that ten years on people <b>still</b> <b>like</b> records we made in the '90s." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine was more positive {{and said the}} album is [...] "warm, welcoming, infused with spirituality and humor. [...] <b>Still</b> <b>like</b> any period of transition, this is somewhat tentative and uneven, with its best moments, being at best, minor masterpieces." [...] Biographer Steve Turner called the album, [...] "lethargic and uninspired" [...] but says that {{perhaps it was the}} album Morrison needed to make after being largely absent from the music business for almost three years.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Davis {{became the}} first woman to receive the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award.

2500|$|A reboot of the {{original}} series had been announced since late 2009, when screenwriter Josh Friedman was hired to write a pilot script. Friedman's script was ultimately rejected, and ABC hired Smallville creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar to pen a new version. In an interview, Alfred Gough expressed his desire to avoid doing anything [...] "campy or retro." [...] He later stated, [...] "The characters are real and emotionally grounded, but they <b>still</b> <b>like</b> to have fun, wear great clothes, solve crime, and kick some serious ass...we hope to surprise people and bring {{a whole new generation}} to Charlie's Angels." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a Harrison solo performance, [...] "I Don't Care Anymore" [...] shared {{common ground}} with the Dylan-styled [...] "Apple Scruffs", a track from All Things Must Pass that was then issued as a 1971 B-side. Asked at his pre-tour press conference on 23 October 1974 whether he planned to perform any songs solo in the {{upcoming}} concerts, Harrison replied: [...] "I hope not. I'd like to do some acoustic tunes, but I <b>still</b> <b>like</b> a little back-beat." [...] Harrison's vocal affliction was evident in his singing throughout the subsequent tour, which the press began calling [...] "the Dark Hoarse Tour".|$|E
2500|$|In September 2013 Salmon {{recalled}} [...] "a {{whole lot}} of what I do is tied up in my past. The Scientists, The Beasts of Bourbon, The Surrealists. This is great, but I <b>still</b> <b>like</b> to make new stuff. I've kept my sanity {{over the years by}} doing new stuff and waiting for it to become old enough to be revived". He described how The Surrealists reformed in 2006, for a one-off concert at Azkena Festival, Spain. The Scientists also reunited in 2006 and recorded their performance at Shepherd's Bush, which was issued as a live album, Sedition in the following year.|$|E
