5|$|Despite the {{infusion}} of cash, the banks of New York were reluctant to make the <b>short-term</b> <b>loans</b> they typically provided to facilitate daily stock trades.

5|$|Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury is an oil {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by Albert Chevallier Tayler completed in 1907. It was commissioned by the Kent County Cricket Club {{at the suggestion of}} chairman Lord Harris to celebrate their first County Championship title win. Tayler painted the picture after taking individual sittings with each of the Kent players. With the exception of <b>short-term</b> <b>loans,</b> the painting remained at the St Lawrence Ground until 1999, at which time it was moved to the Lord's Pavilion as the Kent Club could no longer afford the insurance. In 2006, Kent sold the painting to a charity foundation at an auction. The piece is currently on display at Lord's Cricket Ground in London.|$|E

40|$|A {{financial}} institution involved in commercial lending makes a <b>short-term</b> <b>loan</b> (for example, 90 days) to a borrower under a long-term credit commitment (for example, 5 years). The {{financial institution}} transfers the <b>short-term</b> <b>loan,</b> without recourse, to a third-party purchaser {{for the remaining}} term of the loan. The risk of loss relating to the <b>short-term</b> <b>loan</b> is legally transferred to the purchaser, and the financial institution has no contractual obligation to repurchase the shortterm loan. Under the long-term credit commitment, the financial institution may, at the maturity of the <b>short-term</b> <b>loan,</b> relend to the borrower. However, the financial institution may refuse to relend to the borrower based on a current credit evaluation or if any covenant under the long-term commitment is not satisfied. The issue is whether {{the transfer of the}} <b>short-term</b> <b>loan</b> should be accounted for as a sale or as a financing.

25|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, Turkey's economy had perhaps reached its worst crisis {{since the fall}} of the Ottoman Empire. Turkish {{authorities}} had failed to take sufficient measures to adjust to the effects of the sharp increase in world oil prices in 1973–74 and had financed the resulting deficits with <b>short-term</b> <b>loans</b> from foreign lenders. By 1979 inflation had reached triple-digit levels, unemployment had risen to about 15 percent, industry was using only half its capacity, and the government was unable to pay even the interest on foreign loans. It seemed that Turkey would be able to sustain crisis-free development only if major changes were made in the government's import-substitution approach to development. Many observers doubted the ability of Turkish politicians to carry out the needed reforms.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{what would}} be later called court Jews emerged when local rulers used {{services}} of Jewish bankers for <b>short-term</b> <b>loans.</b> They lent money to nobles and in the process gained social influence. Noble patrons of court Jews employed them as financiers, suppliers, diplomats and trade delegates. Court Jews could use their family connections, and connections between each other, to provision their sponsors with, among other things, food, arms, ammunition and precious metals. In return for their services, court Jews gained social privileges, including up to noble status for themselves, and could live outside the Jewish ghettos. Some nobles wanted to keep their bankers in their own courts. And because they were under noble protection, they were exempted from rabbinical jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|The bank offered {{loans to}} income-producing manor owners (about 70–80% of total loans) or {{property}} owners in cities. Long-term loans were paid not in cash, but in mortgage bonds which provided for a fixed annual interest to their holders. Initially, that interest was 6%. Twice a year, the borrowers {{had to pay}} the interest to mortgage bond holders plus 1% administrative fee to the bank. This fee was lowered several times and in 1900s it was 0.25% for manor owners and 0.5% for city residents. The loans were provided for only up to 60% of the appraised value of the mortgaged real estate. The terms of the long-term loans varied over the years. Initially, the loans for manor owners were offered for 43.5, 48.67, or 54.5 years. More terms were added later, the longest being 66.17 years. The loan terms for city residents were shorter: initially up to 27.5 years and later up to 38.33 years. Most borrowers (more than 80% in 1912–1914) opted for the longest possible loans. <b>Short-term</b> <b>loans,</b> for one to three years, were available only for up to 10% of the appraised real estate value.|$|E

On 8 October, in response to the crisis, the government announced a bank rescue package of £500billion; approximately [...] The plan aimed to restore market confidence, help stabilise the British banking system and provide for a range of <b>short-term</b> <b>loans</b> and guarantees of interbank lending, and up to £50billion of state investment in the banks themselves.

500|$|As a distributor, FBO's {{roster of}} films was about half {{independent}} and foreign productions, half its own studio output. At {{the height of}} its activity (1923–28), it released an average of around 110 features and shorts a year, focusing on distribution to small-town exhibitors and independent theater chains (that is, those not owned {{by one of the}} major Hollywood studios). As a production company, Film Booking Offices concentrated on low-budget movies, with an emphasis on Westerns, romantic melodramas, and comedy shorts. From its first productions in early 1920 through late 1928, when it was dissolved in a merger, the company produced approximately 400 films under the brand of either Robertson-Cole Pictures or FBO Pictures. Between 1924 and 1926, several higher-end productions were made under the rubric of Gothic Pictures. The studio's top-of-the-line movies, aimed at major exhibition venues beyond the reach of most FBO films, were sometimes marketed as FBO [...] "Gold Bond" [...] pictures. Without the backing of large corporate interests, nor the security of its own theater chain, the company faced cash-flow difficulties during its earlier years. <b>Short-term</b> <b>loans</b> at high interest rates posed a significant financial drain.|$|E
500|$|The cost of {{building}} the railway had greatly exceeded the estimates. By September 1825 the company had borrowed £60,000 in <b>short-term</b> <b>loans</b> and needed to start earning an income to ward of its creditors. A railway coach, named Experiment, arrived {{on the evening of}} 26 September 1825 and was attached to Locomotion No. 1, which had been placed on the rails {{for the first time at}} Aycliffe Lane station following the completion of its journey by road from Newcastle earlier that same day. Pease, Stephenson and other members of the committee then made an experimental journey to Darlington [...] before taking the locomotive and coach to Shildon in preparation for the opening day, with James Stephenson, George's elder brother, at the controls. On 27 September, between 7am and 8am, 12 waggons of coal were drawn up Etherley North Bank by a rope attached to the stationary engine at the top, and then let down the South Bank to St Helen's Auckland. A waggon of flour bags was attached and horses hauled the train across the Gaunless Bridge to the bottom of Brusselton West Bank, where thousands watched the second stationary engine draw the train up the incline. The train was let down the East Bank to Mason's Arms Crossing at Shildon Lane End, where Locomotion No. 1, Experiment and 21 new coal waggons fitted with seats were waiting.|$|E

500|$|The Great Depression had a {{significant}} impact on the Brown Company. Berlin at that time had a population of about 20,000 people, most of whom either worked for the company or provided services to the families of company employees. The Brown family had borrowed heavily during the 1920s to fund expansion, and, as stated by a company employee, had become [...] "complacent and overly optimistic." [...] The family's nepotism may also have become a disadvantage. Reduced demand for the company's products forced it to take out <b>short-term</b> <b>loans</b> to provide operating capital, and by 1931 the international financial situation led to major losses in the value of the company's bonds. As a result, in the winter of 1931–32 the Brown Company could not obtain the necessary financing for its logging operations, when it normally needed to employ 4,000 to 5,000 loggers to cut timber each winter. Family members sold off personal holdings to try to keep the company solvent, and W. R. Brown dispersed his entire herd of Arabian horses. [...] In 1933, he negotiated a cooperative financing plan with the City of Berlin and the State of New Hampshire, ratified by the state legislature, to fund the woods operations, keeping Berlin's local residents employed. [...] The company was nevertheless forced to file for bankruptcy in 1935, after having gone into receivership the previous year. A court-appointed president took over, but Brown continued as head of the Woods Division. [...] Brown's agreement with the City of Berlin lasted until 1941, when the company again filed for bankruptcy. [...] Ultimately the Brown family ceased to have {{a significant}} role on the board of directors and the company was sold to outside investors. Brown officially retired from the company in 1943, but his brother O. B. remained on the board of directors until 1960.|$|E

2500|$|Fractional-reserve banking ordinarily {{functions}} smoothly. Relatively few depositors demand payment at {{any given}} time, and banks maintain a buffer of reserves to cover depositors' cash withdrawals and other demands for funds. [...] However, during a bank run or a generalized financial crisis, demands for withdrawal can exceed the bank's funding buffer, and the bank {{will be forced to}} raise additional reserves to avoid defaulting on its obligations. A bank can raise funds from additional borrowings (e.g., by borrowing in the interbank lending market or from the central bank), by selling assets, or by calling in <b>short-term</b> <b>loans.</b> If creditors are afraid that the bank is running out of reserves or is insolvent, they have an incentive to redeem their deposits as soon as possible before other depositors access the remaining reserves.
