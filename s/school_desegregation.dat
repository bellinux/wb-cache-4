Caption: "Jack Parker, retired University of Oklahoma {{education}} professor, was superintendent of OKC public schools in 1961 when the desegregation lawsuit still before the U. S. Supreme Court was filed. He says he believed at the time, and still believes, in integrated <b>schools.</b> (<b>Desegregation</b> move included busing students to achieve racial balance.) ...|$|R

5|$|Due to a <b>school</b> <b>desegregation</b> suit in 1972, {{the court}} {{required}} St. Louis {{to accept a}} busing plan in 1980. Judge William L. Hungate declared that a mandatory plan would go into effect unless other arrangements were made {{to adhere to the}} terms of the suit. In 1983, an unprecedented voluntary busing plan was put into place, integrating the schools without a mandated plan being required.|$|E
5|$|In Mississippi fear of {{violence}} prevented any plaintiff from bringing a <b>school</b> <b>desegregation</b> suit {{for the next}} nine years. When Medgar Evers sued to desegregate Jackson, Mississippi schools in 1963 White Citizens Council member Byron De La Beckwith murdered him. Two subsequent trials resulted in hung juries. Beckwith was not convicted of the murder until 1994.|$|E
5|$|In North Carolina, {{there was}} often a {{strategy}} of nominally accepting Brown, but tacitly resisting it. On May 18, 1954 the Greensboro, North Carolina school board declared that it would abide by the Brown ruling. This {{was the result of}} the initiative of D.E. Hudgins Jr, a former Rhodes Scholar and prominent attorney, who chaired the school board. This made Greensboro the first, and for years the only, city in the South, to announce its intent to comply. However, others in the city resisted integration, putting up legal obstacles to the actual implementation of <b>school</b> <b>desegregation</b> for years afterward, and in 1969, the federal government found the city was not in compliance with the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Transition to a fully integrated school system did not begin until 1971, after numerous local lawsuits and both nonviolent and violent demonstrations. Historians have noted the irony that Greensboro, which had heralded itself as such a progressive city, was one of the last holdouts for <b>school</b> <b>desegregation.</b>|$|E
40|$|This video recording, dated June 22, 1985, {{consists}} of a panel discussion held by the Friends of Marcus Books, located in Oakland, California. The discussion, held {{in honor of the}} 25 th anniversary of the bookstore, was titled “Education for Black Liberation. ” Among the participants was Dr. Asa G. Hilliard, III, who discussed the impact of inappropriate media on the self-image of young African Americans, the importance of reading the scholarly work of Cheikh Anta Diop and other writers available at Marcus Books, and the work he did on the Portland Public <b>Schools</b> <b>desegregation</b> efforts...|$|R
50|$|In 1968 {{there were}} 771 white {{students}} in the county <b>school</b> system. <b>Desegregation</b> occurred in 1969, and that year the white student population decreased to 228. In 1970 no white students were enrolled.|$|R

5|$|Fifty-eight bills about <b>school</b> <b>desegregation</b> {{were filed}} for {{consideration}} by the Virginia Assembly. The administration immediately entered into negotiations {{to amend the}} Stanley plan to allow parents to sue a school district to force it to accept state funds (and resegregate). The Boothe-Dalton and McCue plans were also filed. Backers of the Gray Commission plan filed 14 bills to implement the Commission's proposals, but the Gray plan's supporters said they would abandon their pupil assignment plan {{in favor of the}} Mann-Fenwick pupil assignment plan. Delegate C.W. Cleaton introduced a bill to prohibit school districts from raising private money to operate integrated schools, Senator Eugene Snydor introduced a bill to allow residents to vote on whether integrated schools should be closed and whether closed schools should be reopened as segregated, and Delegate Griffith Purcell introduced a bill to require a statewide referendum in November 1956 on whether school segregation should be state policy.|$|E

50|$|Early in {{the morning}} of October 5, 1958, the Clinton High School {{building}} was severely damaged by a series of dynamite explosions. An estimated 75 to 100 sticks of dynamite had been placed in three locations in the building. No one was injured, but school official estimated damages at $300,000. Clinton was once again the focus of attention over a crime that was universally assumed {{to be related to the}} <b>school's</b> <b>desegregation.</b> While the <b>school</b> was rebuilt, Clinton High School students were bused to Oak Ridge where the school operated in the recently vacated building that had housed Linden Elementary School. Clinton High School reopened in its own building in 1960.|$|R
50|$|As the {{desegregation}} process {{occurred in}} September 1965, M.R.

25|$|The {{history of}} St. Louis, Missouri from 1981 {{to the present}} {{has been marked by}} city {{beautification}} and crime prevention efforts, a major <b>school</b> <b>desegregation</b> case, and gentrification in its downtown area. St. Louis also continues to struggle with crime and a declining population, although some improvement has been made in both of these aspects.|$|E
25|$|In Georgia, the Confederate battle {{flag was}} reintroduced {{as an element}} of the state flag in 1956, just two years after the Supreme Court {{decision}} Brown v. Board of Education. It was {{considered by many to be}} a protest against <b>school</b> <b>desegregation.</b> It was also raised at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) during protests against integration of schools.|$|E
25|$|Little Rock Central High School (LRCHS) is an {{accredited}} comprehensive {{public high}} school in Little Rock, Arkansas, United States. Central High School {{was the site of}} forced <b>school</b> <b>desegregation</b> after the US Supreme Court ruled in 1954 that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. This was during the period of heightened activism in the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
5000|$|Scott {{played a}} {{prominent}} role in numerous cases involving the desegregation of U.S. public schools, including the Morgan v. Hennigan Boston desegregation case of 1974. As the Associate Dean of the School of Education at Boston University, Scott, along with Robert Dentler, then Dean of the School of Education at Boston University, was appointed as a sociological expert. He was appointed to help Judge W. Arthur Garrity to assist in the Boston Public <b>Schools</b> <b>desegregation</b> plan. Scott played a primary role in the desegregation plan, which became paramount in the civil rights struggle within U.S. public education. Scott and Dentler coauthored Schools on Trial, a book published in 1981 about the case and their role in it. In the book, they state, “Desegregation has been achieved in Boston. Quality integrated education will take longer.” ...|$|R

25|$|While {{building}} his company, Lowe {{became involved with}} the lives of others. Lowe {{served as chairman of}} the multiracial Dallas Alliance Education Task Force, which worked to develop a widely accepted <b>school</b> <b>desegregation</b> plan. The plan was adopted almost word-for-word by the United States federal courts. For his work on the Dallas Alliance Education Task Force, Lowe was awarded Dallas' highest community service accolades — the Linz Award — in 1976.|$|E
25|$|The University of Virginia {{began the}} process of {{integration}} even before the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision mandated <b>school</b> <b>desegregation</b> for all grade levels, when Gregory Swanson sued to gain entrance into the university's law school in 1950. Following his successful lawsuit, a handful of black graduate and professional students were admitted during the 1950s, though no black undergraduates were admitted until 1955, and UVA did not fully integrate until the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Like many abolitionists, Douglass {{believed}} that education would be crucial for African Americans {{to improve their}} lives. This led Douglass to become an early advocate for <b>school</b> <b>desegregation.</b> In the 1850s, Douglass observed that New York's facilities and instruction for African-American children were vastly inferior to those for whites. Douglass called for court action to open all schools to all children. He said that full inclusion within the educational system was a more pressing need for African Americans than political issues such as suffrage.|$|E
50|$|In May 2016 the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi {{ordered the}} school {{district}} to consolidate the Cleveland High with East Side High <b>School</b> for <b>desegregation</b> purposes. Cleveland High School will house all high school students, while the former East Side High School will house all middle school students.|$|R
5000|$|Recent {{enrollment}} statistics {{suggest that}} Lee is slowly becoming a multicultural <b>school.</b> Since <b>desegregation,</b> black and whites {{have been the}} largest student ethnic groups, but Hispanic students topped 100 in 2007-08, after 16 years of general growth. If this trend continues, the presence of Spanish in Lee's hallways will become more commonplace.|$|R
50|$|Ryder also {{believed}} strongly that Northeastern {{should play a}} role in the community it inhabited. Looking for ways to develop strong relations between NU and the local community, in 1976 he created the Office of Community Development (renamed the Office of Community Affairs in 1981) to work on various community projects. In 1975, under Ryder’s leadership Northeastern participated in Phase II of the Boston public <b>schools</b> <b>desegregation</b> plan in which 21 Boston area colleges and universities each paired up with a specific Boston public school to assist in educational development. NU was paired with Madison Park High School in District 7. NU also participated in the Southwest Corridor Project, an economic and environmental urban renewal project to improve Boston's transportation by developing the land near NU's property into residential, commercial, and light industrial enterprises. In 1986 the Ruggles Street MBTA Station was created.|$|R
25|$|During {{the later}} years of Morrison's administration, {{and for the}} {{entirety}} of Schiro's, the city was a center of the Civil Rights Movement. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference was founded there, and lunch counter sit-ins were held in Canal Street department stores. A prominent and violent series of confrontations occurred in 1960 when the city attempted <b>school</b> <b>desegregation,</b> following the Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954). When six-year-old Ruby Bridges integrated William Frantz Elementary School in the Ninth Ward, {{she was the first}} child of color to attend a previously all-white school in the South.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Green, many Southern districts replaced freedom-of-choice with geographically based schooling plans; because residential segregation was widespread, little integration was accomplished. In 1971, the Court in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education approved busing as a remedy to segregation; three years later, though, {{in the case}} of Milliken v. Bradley (1974), it set aside a lower court order that had required the busing of students between districts, instead of merely within a district. Milliken basically ended the Supreme Court's major involvement in school desegregation; however, up through the 1990s many federal trial courts remained involved in <b>school</b> <b>desegregation</b> cases, many of which had begun in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Richberg's {{later life}} {{was marked by}} {{increasing}} conservatism and anti-labor attitudes, the practice of law, and writing. He attempted in 1936 to establish his own law firm in Washington, D.C., but this failed. He joined an existing firm, which took the name Davies, Richberg, Beebe, Busick & Richardson. He was frequently consulted by members of Congress for his expertise in drafting legislation, and {{played a major role}} in authoring the Taft-Hartley Act. In 1956, he helped author a bill introduced into the Virginia General Assembly which would have stopped <b>school</b> <b>desegregation.</b> From 1949 to 1952 he was a lecturer at the University of Virginia School of Law.|$|E
