500|$|Before a meal, {{the stomach}} would preferably be [...] "opened" [...] with an apéritif (from Latin aperire, [...] "to open") that was preferably {{of a hot}} and dry nature: {{confections}} made from sugar- or honey-coated spices like ginger, caraway and <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>anise,</b> fennel or cumin, wine and sweetened fortified milk drinks. As the stomach had been opened, it should then be [...] "closed" [...] {{at the end of}} the meal with the help of a digestive, most commonly a dragée, which during the Middle Ages consisted of lumps of spiced sugar, or hypocras, a wine flavoured with fragrant spices, along with aged cheese. A meal would ideally begin with easily digestible fruit, such as apples. It would then be followed by vegetables such as lettuce, cabbage, purslane, herbs, moist fruits, light meats, such as chicken or goat kid, with potages and broths. After that came the [...] "heavy" [...] meats, such as pork and beef, as well as vegetables and nuts, including pears and chestnuts, both considered difficult to digest.

40|$|Background: Essential oil of Pimpinella anisum L. Apiaceae (anise oil) {{has been}} widely used in {{traditional}} Persian medicine to treat a variety of diseases, including some neurological disorders. This study was aimed to test the possible anti-seizure and anti-hypoxia effects <b>of</b> <b>anise</b> oil. Methods: The effects of different concentrations <b>of</b> <b>anise</b> oil were tested on seizure attacks induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) injection and neuronal hypoxia induced by oxygen withdrawal {{as well as on}} production of dark neurons and induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in in vivo and in vitro experimental models of rat brain. Results: Anise oil significantly prolonged the latency of seizure attacks and reduced the amplitude and duration of epileptiform burst discharges induced by injection of intraperitoneal PTZ. In addition, anise oil significantly inhibited production of dark neurons in different regions of the brain in epileptic rats. Anise oil also significantly enhanced the duration of the appearance of anoxic terminal negativity induced by oxygen withdrawal and inhibited induction of LTP in hippocampal slices.

50|$|Western cuisines {{have long}} used anise to flavor dishes, drinks, and candies. The word {{is used for}} both the species of herb and its licorice-like flavor. The most {{powerful}} flavor component of the essential oil <b>of</b> <b>anise,</b> anethole, is found in both anise and an unrelated spice indigenous to northern China called star anise (Illicium verum) widely used in South Asian, Southeast Asian, and East Asian dishes. Star anise is considerably less expensive to produce, and has gradually displaced P. anisum in Western markets.

5000|$|Anethole (anise camphor) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} that {{is widely used}} as a flavoring substance. It is a derivative of phenylpropene, a type of aromatic compound that occurs widely in nature, in essential oils. It contributes a large component of the odor and flavor <b>of</b> <b>anise</b> and fennel (both in the botanical family Apiaceae), anise myrtle (Myrtaceae), liquorice (Fabaceae), camphor, magnolia blossoms, and star anise (Illiciaceae). Closely related to anethole is its isomer estragole, abundant in tarragon (Asteraceae) and basil (Lamiaceae), that has a flavor reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>anise.</b> It is a colorless, fragrant, mildly volatile liquid. Anethole is only slightly soluble in water but exhibits high solubility in ethanol. This difference causes certain anise-flavored liqueurs to become opaque when diluted with water, the ouzo effect.|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the possible use <b>of</b> <b>anise</b> (Pimpinella anisum) and/or α-tocopheryl acetate as dietary supplements on the performance and some egg quality characteristics of laying Japanese quail. One hundred and eight Coturnix japonica quail (72 females and 36 males), 149 days old, were randomly allocated to four equal groups with three subgroups of nine birds each (six females and three males). A commercial laying diet was fed to the control group (Group A). The remaining three groups received the same diet supplemented with anise seed at 10 g/kg (Group B) or 20 g/kg (Group C), or additional 600 mg α-tocopheryl acetate/kg (Group D). The birds were given feed and water ad libitum {{for a period of}} 29 days, while being kept under commercial conditions. During the experiment, egg production, feed consumption and mortality were recorded daily. Also, at the end of experiment, egg weight, egg yolk, albumen and shell weight percentages, egg yolk colour (using the L*a*b * colour space), blood serum total cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations were determined. Neither the supplementation <b>of</b> <b>anise</b> nor that <b>of</b> α-tocopheryl had any effect on the performance of the birds or the quality of their eggs, except for a significant change of the colour of the egg yolk. Cholesterol concentration in the serum tended to decrease with the addition <b>of</b> <b>anise</b> to the diet. _______________________________________________________________________________...|$|R
