40|$|The {{commercial}} {{availability of}} inexpensive fiber optics and <b>small</b> <b>volume</b> <b>pumps</b> {{in the early}} 1990 's provided the components necessary for the successful development of low power, low reagent consumption, autonomous optofluidic analyzers for marine applications. It was evident that to achieve calibration-free performance, reagent-based sensors would require frequent renewal of the reagent by pumping the reagent from an impermeable, inert reservoir to the sensing interface. Pumping also enabled measurement of a spectral blank further enhancing accuracy and stability. The first instrument that was developed based on this strategy, the Submersible Autonomous Moored Instrument for CO 2 (SAMI-CO 2), uses a pH indicator for measurement of the partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2). Because the pH indicator gives an optical response, the instrument requires an optofluidic design where the indicator is pumped into a gas permeable membrane and then to an optical cell for analysis. The pH indicator is periodically flushed from the optical cell by using a valve to switch from the pH indicator to a blank solution. Because of the <b>small</b> <b>volume</b> and low power light source, over 8, 500 measurements can be obtained with a ~ 500 mL reagent bag and 8 alkaline D-cell battery pack. The primary drawback is that the design is more complex compared to the single-ended electrode or optode that is envisioned as the ideal sensor. The SAMI technology has subsequently been used for the successful development of autonomous pH and total alkalinity analyzers. In this manuscript, we will discuss {{the pros and cons}} of the SAMI pCO 2 and pH optofluidic technology and highlight some past data sets and applications for studying the carbon cycle in aquatic ecosystems...|$|R
5000|$|Heavier fuels like {{diesel fuel}} have higher cetane ratings and lower octane ratings, {{resulting}} in increased tendency to ignite spontaneously and burn {{completely in the}} cylinders when injected. Increased compression ratios create higher combustion chamber temperatures to ignite the injected fuel. Higher compression ratios increase pumping losses as more work is required to compress intake air to a <b>smaller</b> <b>volume,</b> but <b>pumping</b> loss increases are offset by increased power and efficiency. Increasing compression ratios in spark-ignition engines requires higher octane fuels that are harder to ignite and burn completely and/or advanced spark timing to avoid pre-ignition, knocking and resulting performance losses and engine damage. Power gains from increased compression ratios are reduced in spark-ignition engines while the pumping losses remain comparable to similar compression ratio increases in diesel engines.|$|R
40|$|Fluid {{simulation}} at the nano/mesoscale is {{a complement}} to direct experimental measurements and a suitable methodology {{to explore new}} physical mechanisms to manipulate and control <b>small</b> <b>volumes</b> of fluids. <b>Pumping</b> of water through nanochannels is an important research topic due to the current advances in micro and nanotechnology, which largely benefits from computer simulations. This research demonstrates via molecular dynamics simulations that a significant water flow production is attainable at the nanoscale, exploiting a new, non-intrusive pumping method which relies upon the use of proper electric fields. Furthermore, it is shown that this new scheme can be employed in a realistic environment, opening up potential applications in biotechnology and desalination, and effective alternative to standard nanopumping techniques...|$|R
40|$|Highest Honors in PhysicsEnclosed {{microfluidic}} devices provide excellent {{systems for}} the study of biological processes such as cell-cell, paracrine, and autocrine signaling systems. By minimizing the fluid volume within the chambers, microfluidic devices diminish the dilution of secreted products which makes the detection of the secreted products a more straightforward task. A major design problem associated with the construction of microfluidic devices for biological research is the need to provide well-controlled fluidic transportation for cells, the nutrients that the cells need, and waste removal. Most precision syringe pumps which can accurately provide low flow rates are expensive and constitute a barrier to experiment design. Electroosmotic pumps could potentially provide a valuable alternative as a low <b>volume</b> flow rate <b>pumping</b> system for many types of microfluidic devices. We have developed a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microfluidic device that incorporates both electroosmotic flow and pressure driven flow. The device is designed to increase the relative strength of the electroosmotic flow (EOF) component of the total flow through the use of an array of <b>small</b> <b>volume</b> parallel <b>pumping</b> channels which provide higher passive resistance to pressure driven flow than a larger <b>volume</b> single-channel EOF <b>pump.</b> Using a novel microfluidic instrumentation device which we call the "Micro Programmable Object Navigation Gadget" (µ-PONG), we investigate how different properties and geometries of the device affect the EOF rate. Â  In addition, we demonstrate that fluid flow driven by a small hydraulic pressure head can be completely canceled by an user initiated EOF in the pumping channels which are incorporated into a microfluidic device. The ability to modulate the flow and to create "stop flow" conditions in microfluidic devices is also important for biological research.

40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>volume</b> provers and {{associated}} technology {{have been in}} use throughout the world by weights and measures jurisdictions and industry for meter verification (pulse-generating meters) since the 1980 ’s. However, field standard test measures and large volume graduated neck-type provers, as described in NBS Handbook 105 - 3, are most commonly used as field standards by weights and measures officials in the United States. The American Petroleum Institute (API) documented the proper design and use of <b>small</b> <b>volume</b> provers in 1988 : “Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards, ” Chapter 4, Proving Systems, Section 3, <b>Small</b> <b>Volume</b> Provers, and Section 6, Pulse Interpolation.
