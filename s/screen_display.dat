5|$|Another {{hardware}} quirk produced one of {{the most}} distinctive aspects of the ZX81's <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> – during loading or saving, moving zigzag stripes appear across the screen. The same pin on the ULA is used to handle the video signal and the tape output, producing the stripes as an interference pattern of sorts. The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations, as it has to operate continuously to maintain the correct baud rate for data transfers. The interference produces the zigzag stripes.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's {{built-in}} RF modulator can output a video {{picture to}} either a UHF 625-line colour or monochrome television (used in the UK, Australia, and most western European countries). France required a slightly {{modified version of the}} machine to match the positive video modulation of SECAM sets, while the USA and Canada required a different ULA chip and modulator to cope with their 525-line VHF (NTSC) television systems. Both the ZX81 and its predecessor, the ZX80, have a significant drawback {{in the way that they}} handle visual output. Neither machine has enough processing power to run at full speed and simultaneously maintain the <b>screen</b> <b>display.</b> On the ZX80, this means that the screen goes blank every time the machine carries out a computation and causes an irritating flicker whenever a shorter computation – such as processing a keystroke – takes place.|$|E

25|$|Drawing {{molecules}} {{requires a}} transformation between molecular coordinates (usually, but not always, in Angstrom units) and the screen. Because many molecules are chiral {{it is essential}} that the handedness of the system (almost always right-handed) is preserved. In molecular graphics the origin (0, 0) is usually at the lower left, while in many computer systems the origin is at top left. If the z-coordinate is out of the screen (towards the viewer) the molecule will be referred to right-handed axes, while the <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> will be left-handed.|$|E
25|$|The 6809 {{was used}} in Commodore's dual-CPU SuperPET computer, and, in its 68A09 incarnation, in the unique vector {{graphics}} based Vectrex home video game console with built-in <b>screen</b> <b>display,</b> and was also used in the Milton Bradley Expansion (MBX) system (an arcade console for use with the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A home computer). The 6809E was featured in the TRS-80 Color Computer (CoCo), the Acorn System 2, 3 and 4 computers (as an optional alternative to their standard 6502), the Fujitsu FM-7, the Canon CX-1, the Welsh-made Dragon 32/64 home computers, and the SWTPC, Gimix, Smoke Signal Broadcasting, etc. SS-50 Bus bus systems, in addition to several of Motorola's own EXORmacs and EXORset development systems. In France, Thomson micro-informatique produced a series of micro-computers based on the 6809E (TO7, TO7/70, TO8, TO8D, TO9, TO9Plus, MO5, MO6, MO5E and MO5NR).|$|E
500|$|Unlike GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark {{features}} three multiplayer systems. The {{first is}} a co-operative mode in which two players, or one player and up to three computer-controlled players, can tackle the missions together. If two humans play, the game uses a split <b>screen</b> <b>display,</b> with the option to split horizontally or vertically. Only one human player is required to survive the mission, but all the objectives must be completed. Additionally, the game features a [...] "Counter Operative" [...] mode in which one player plays the missions as Joanna while another takes {{over the role of}} an enemy and attempts to stop her. If this human-controlled guard is killed, the game continues with the Counter Operative player taking control of a different enemy in the level. The game does not tell the player controlling Joanna which enemy the Counter Operative player is controlling.|$|E

500|$|When {{developing}} Shadow Dragon, {{the team}} {{did not see}} it as a simple remake, but rather a [...] "renewal" [...] of the original on a new platform with new and updated mechanics. The most difficult part was balancing this with maintaining the original version's atmosphere. Numerous features were added to the experience, such as displays for movement and attack range, the ability to change classes and unit recruitment if too many of the original army fell in battle. Expanded difficulty options and tutorials were also added to help ease newcomers into the series. The by-then well established Weapon Triangle was also introduced, replacing the unbalanced systems from the original. The addition of a single mid-battle save was intended to help ease newcomers into the series, so they would not need to restart the entire battle if a key unit fell. The dual <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> of both map and unit placement and status was indirectly inspired by the original version, which allowed players to view character stats without dropping out of the map.|$|E
500|$|The HTC One shipped with Android 4.1.2 [...] "Jelly Bean" [...] and version 5.0 of HTC’s {{proprietary}} Sense software suite. In {{comparison to}} previous {{versions of the}} software, Sense 5 uses a flat, minimalist visual style with refreshed icons and the condensed variant of the Roboto font family. Instead of a traditional home <b>screen</b> <b>display</b> with apps and widgets, Sense 5 defaults to a screen known as BlinkFeed, a news aggregator which displays a scrolling grid of news headlines from selected sources (as syndicated by Mobiles Republic) and social network content {{in a similar fashion}} to Flipboard and Windows Phone’s live tiles. New content is synchronized every two hours when connected to a mobile network, but more frequently while on Wi-Fi. Directly above the BlinkFeed display is a clock which displays the user’s local time and weather forecast; the signature flip clock widget seen on previous HTC devices was replaced by a simpler digital clock for Sense 5. Hundreds of different clock designs by HTC’s designers, narrowed down to 25, were considered before the final design was chosen. As with previous versions of Sense, users can still add or remove pages on the home screen for housing app shortcuts and widgets; one such page is provided by default, and which page to display by default can be set by the user. However, BlinkFeed will always occupy the leftmost page of the home screen. The application drawer uses a 3x4 grid to display application shortcuts by default, but can still be changed back to the denser 4x5 grid used by past versions. Apps can also be sorted into folders within the drawer; a number of preset folders are provided, such as [...] "Google", [...] "Media", [...] "Productivity", [...] "Tools", and pre-loaded apps provided by the user’s wireless carrier, where applicable.|$|E
