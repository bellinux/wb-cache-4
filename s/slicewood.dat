40|$|This {{study was}} {{compared}} and characterized two different alkali (potassium carbonate (PC) and potassium acetate (PA)) -catalyzed acetylations of <b>slicewood</b> with vinyl acetate (VA) by a vapor phase reaction. The {{results revealed that}} the esterification reaction between VA and the hydroxyl groups of <b>slicewood</b> could be improved by using PC or PA as a catalyst. Additionally, a significant weight percent gain was obtained after VA acetylation with 5 % of catalyst. Furthermore, the reactivity of the cellulose hydroxyl groups for VA acetylation was more pronounced at the C 2 reactive site compared to acetylation with acetic anhydride. On the other hand, the apparent activation energy of thermal decomposition between 10 % and 70 % conversion is 174 – 183, 194 – 200, and 183 – 186 kJ/mol for unmodified <b>slicewood</b> and VA-acetylated <b>slicewood</b> with PC and PA, respectively. Accordingly, the thermal stability of the <b>slicewood</b> could be effectively enhanced by VA acetylation, especially for using the PC as a catalyst...|$|E
