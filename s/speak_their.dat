In culture and social life, both the Polish language and Catholicism became dominant, and in 1696, Polish replaced Belarusian as the official language—with the Belarusian language being banned from administrative use.

In addition to these, the Teochew people <b>speak</b> <b>their</b> own dialect that has some degree of mutual intelligibility with Hokkien. Distinctions between the two, however, are accentuated outside of their regions of origin. There were an estimated 2.2 million native speakers of various Chinese varieties in Indonesia in 1982: 1,300,000 speakers of Southern Min varieties (including Hokkien and Teochew); 640,000 Hakka speakers; 460,000 Mandarin speakers; 180,000 Cantonese speakers; and 20,000 speakers of the Eastern Min varieties (including Fuzhou dialect). Additionally, an estimated 20,000 spoke different dialects of the Indonesian language.|$|E

They concluded that communication apprehension is a cross-linguistic trait and that the trait is genetically inherited.|$|R

5|$|There {{have been}} {{speakers}} of Goidelic languages in the Inner Hebrides {{since the time}} of Columba or before, and the modern variant of Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig) remains strong in some parts. However, the Education (Scotland) Act 1872 led to generations of Gaels being forbidden to <b>speak</b> <b>their</b> native language in the classroom, and is now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. Children were being beaten for speaking Gaelic in school as late as the 1930s. More recently the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act was enacted by the Scottish Parliament in 2005 in order to provide continuing support for the language.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-first century AD, Christianity {{took root}} in Egypt {{and it was}} {{originally}} seen as another cult that could be accepted. However, it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from Egyptian Religion and Greco-Roman religion and threatened popular religious traditions. This led to the persecution of converts to Christianity, culminating in the great purges of Diocletian starting in 303, but eventually Christianity won out. In 391 the Christian Emperor Theodosius introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples. Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed. As a consequence, Egypt's native religious culture was continually in decline. While the native population certainly continued to <b>speak</b> <b>their</b> language, {{the ability to read}} hieroglyphic writing slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to churches or abandoned to the desert.|$|E

5|$|Mandarin and Malay, in particular, {{the local}} variety of Malay, that is, Sarawakian Malay or Bahasa Sarawak, are widely spoken here. English is spoken to some extent, with most Mirians being {{incapable}} of speaking English with impeccable grammar. The respective ethnic groups also <b>speak</b> <b>their</b> own languages. Indigenous groups speak languages such as Berawan, Bruneian/Kedayan, Miriek, Iban, Bidayuh, Kayan, Kenyah, and Kelabit. Meanwhile, the Chinese would speak Mandarin, Hakka Chinese, Cantonese, Teochew dialect, Hainanese, and the Fuzhou dialect. However, {{the younger generation}} in Miri tends to use lingua francas (Mandarin and Malay) rather than their indigenous languages (such as Kayan and Kelabit), {{with the exception of}} Iban, which is widely used here, or Chinese dialects (Hokkien and Foochow), and an effort has been made to promote the usage of indigenous languages among the younger generation.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the council}} {{had the right to}} <b>speak</b> <b>their</b> minds freely, and {{although}} {{there is no evidence that}} they voted on affairs of state or that the king was even obligated to implement their ideas, it is clear that he was at least occasionally pressured to do so. The assembly was apparently given the right to judge cases of high treason and assign punishments for them, such as when Alexander III acted as prosecutor in the trial and ultimate conviction of three alleged conspirators in the plot to assassinate Philip II (while many others were acquitted). However, there is perhaps insufficient evidence to allow a conclusion that councils and assemblies were regularly upheld, constitutionally grounded, or that their decisions were always heeded by the king. At the death of Alexander the Great, the companions immediately formed a council to assume control of his empire; however, it was soon destabilized by open rivalry and conflict between its members. The army also used mutiny as a tool to achieve political ends. For instance, when Perdiccas had Philip II's daughter Cynane murdered to prevent her own daughter Eurydice II of Macedon from marrying Philip III of Macedon, the army revolted and ensured that the marriage took place.|$|E
5|$|Mongolian is the {{official}} national language of Mongolia, where it is spoken (but not written) by nearly 3.6 million people (2014 estimate), and {{the official}} provincial language (both spoken and written forms) of Inner Mongolia, China, where {{there are at least}} 4.1 million ethnic Mongols. Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate) However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the language proficiency of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian in Inner Mongolia, has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012. However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanized Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban ethnic communities. The multilingual situation in Inner Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language. Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to <b>speak</b> <b>their</b> language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols. The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols.|$|E
