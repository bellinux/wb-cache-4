25|$|In October 1957, Paul {{took on a}} Ford Foundation {{fellowship}} at CERN in Geneva which Berta Karlik hat procured for him. At CERN, {{the first}} particle accelerator, the <b>synchrocyclotron,</b> had just started operation, and Paul {{got the chance to}} work on the first experiment that was carried out with this machine. It consisted of the search for the rare decay of the charged pion into an electron and a neutrino, which was indeed found to occur with a probability of 0.012% relative to the normal decay into muon and neutrino.|$|E
25|$|In 1950 Ashkin {{joined the}} physics faculty of Carnegie Mellon University (then the Carnegie Institute of Technology) where Edward Creutz was {{department}} head {{and director of}} a new 450 MeV proton <b>synchrocyclotron</b> that CIT had built in nearby Saxonburg, Pennsylvania. Joining fellow scientists Lincoln Wolfenstein and Sergio de Benedetti, at this time Ashkin began to transition from mainly theoretical to mainly experimental work. The cyclotron remained in use at the Saxonburg Nuclear Research Center until the mid-1970s when it was dismantled and, using it, Ashkin was able to produce some of his best-known experimental results.|$|E
25|$|In 1958–1959 Ashkin won a Ford Foundation {{grant to}} spend a sabbatical year in Geneva, Switzerland, at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. There, he {{became a member of}} the first group of {{scientists}} to use that institution's new 600 MeV <b>synchrocyclotron.</b> Using this particle accelerator he helped to make a significant discovery which confirmed an aspect of the V-A Theory of weak interactions. Supported by a grant from the Guggenheim Foundation, in 1968 he also spent a year as a Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford.|$|E
50|$|<b>Synchrocyclotrons</b> are {{attractive}} {{for use in}} proton therapy because {{of the ability to}} make compact systems using high magnetic fields. Medical physics companies Ion Beam Applications and Mevion Medical Systems have developed superconducting <b>synchrocyclotrons</b> that can fit comfortably into hospitals.|$|R

50|$|<b>Synchrocyclotrons</b> {{have not}} been built since the {{isochronous}} cyclotron was developed.|$|R
25|$|The {{spiraling}} {{of electrons}} in a cylindrical vacuum chamber within a transverse magnetic field is also {{employed in the}} magnetron, a device for producing high frequency radio waves (microwaves). The synchrotron moves the particles through a path of constant radius, allowing it to be made as a pipe and so of much larger radius than is practical with the cyclotron and <b>synchrocyclotron.</b> The larger radius allows the use of numerous magnets, each of which imparts angular momentum and so allows particles of higher velocity (mass) to be kept {{within the bounds of}} the evacuated pipe. The magnetic field strength of each of the bending magnets is increased as the particles gain energy {{in order to keep the}} bending angle constant.|$|E
500|$|Returning to the University of California {{as a full}} professor, Alvarez {{had many}} {{ideas about how to}} use his wartime radar {{knowledge}} to improve particle accelerators. Though some of these were to bear fruit, the [...] "big idea" [...] of this time would come from Edwin McMillan with his concept of phase stability which led to the <b>synchrocyclotron.</b> Refining and extending this concept, the Lawrence team would build the world's then-largest proton accelerator, the Bevatron, which began operating in 1954. Though the Bevatron could produce copious amounts of interesting particles, particularly in secondary collisions, these complex interactions were hard to detect and analyze at the time.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>synchro{{cyclotron}}</b> is a cyclotron {{in which}} {{the frequency of the}} driving RF electric field is varied to compensate for relativistic effects as the particles' velocity begins to approach the speed of light. This is in contrast to the classical cyclotron, where the frequency was held constant, thus leading to the <b>synchrocyclotron</b> operation frequency being ...|$|E
50|$|The Grand Accélérateur National d’Ions Lourds (GANIL), or Large Heavy Ion National Accelerator, is a French {{national}} {{nuclear physics}} {{research center in}} Caen. The facility consists primarily of two serialised <b>synchrocyclotrons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The next {{development}} {{step of the}} cyclotron concept, the isochronous cyclotron, {{maintains a}} constant RF driving frequency and compensates for relativistic effects by increasing the magnetic field with radius. Isochronous cyclotrons are capable of producing much greater beam current than <b>synchrocyclotrons.</b> As a result, isochronous cyclotrons became more popular in the research field.|$|R
50|$|One {{hindrance}} {{to universal}} {{use of the}} proton in cancer treatment is the size and cost of the cyclotron or synchrotron equipment necessary. Several industrial teams are working on development of comparatively small accelerator systems to deliver the proton therapy to patients. Among the technologies being investigated are superconducting <b>synchrocyclotrons</b> (also known as FM Cyclotrons), ultra-compact synchrotrons, dielectric wall accelerators, and linear particle accelerators.|$|R
2500|$|Therefore, {{the limit}} to the cyclotron's output energy for a given type of {{particle}} is {{the strength of the}} magnetic field , which is limited to about 2 T for ferromagnetic electromagnets, and the radius of the dees , which is determined by the diameter of the magnet's pole pieces. So very large magnets were constructed for cyclotrons, culminating in Lawrence's 1946 <b>synchrocyclotron,</b> which had pole pieces [...] (15.3 feet) in diameter.|$|E
2500|$|An {{alternative}} to the <b>synchrocyclotron</b> is the isochronous cyclotron, which has a magnetic field that increases with radius, rather than with time. Isochronous cyclotrons are capable of producing much greater beam current than synchrocyclotrons, but require azimuthal variations in the field strength to provide a strong focusing effect and keep the particles captured in their spiral trajectory. For this reason, an isochronous cyclotron is also called an [...] "AVF (azimuthal varying field) cyclotron". This solution for focusing the particle beam was proposed by L. H. Thomas in 1938.|$|E
2500|$|In the nonrelativistic approximation, the {{frequency}} {{does not depend}} upon the radius of the particle's orbit, since the particle's mass is constant. As the beam spirals out, its frequency does not decrease, and it must continue to accelerate, as it is travelling a greater distance {{in the same time}} period. In contrast to this approximation, as particles approach the speed of light, their relativistic mass increases, requiring either modifications to {{the frequency}}, leading to the <b>synchrocyclotron,</b> or modifications to the magnetic field during the acceleration, which leads to the isochronous cyclotron. The relativistic mass can be rewritten as ...|$|E
50|$|The major {{advantage}} {{offered by}} a VFFAG design over a FFAG design is that the path-length is held constant between particles with different energies and therefore relativistic particles travel isochronously. Isochronousity of the revolution period enables continuous beam operation, therefore offering the same advantage in power that isochronous cyclotrons have over <b>synchrocyclotrons.</b> Isochronous accelerators have no longitudinal beam focusing, {{but this is not}} a strong limitation in accelerators with rapid ramp rates typically used in FFAG designs.|$|R
40|$|Computer codes {{suitable}} {{for the study of}} beam dynamics in cyclotronlike (classical and isochronous cyclotrons, <b>synchrocyclotrons,</b> and fixed field alternating gradient) accelerators are reviewed. Computer modeling of cyclotron segments, such as the central zone, acceleration region, and extraction system is considered. The author does not claim to give a full and detailed description of the methods and algorithms used in the codes. Special attention is paid to the codes already proven and confirmed at the existing accelerating facilities. The description of the programs prepared in the worldwide known accelerator centers is provided. The basic features of the programs available to users and limitations of their applicability are described...|$|R
40|$|Tvpical illustrative {{examples}} are cited {{for the use}} of grid-controlled power tubes in the various classes of particle acceler-ators, e. p., cyclotrons, <b>synchrocyclotrons,</b> proton synchrotrons, electron synchrotrons, and linear accelerators, A state-of-the-art review of triode and tetrcde power-tube technology is nresented, together with some anparent trends in the design and develop-ment of new tubes. The use of triodes and tetrodes with integral cavity-resonators enhances the feasibility of their use at increasingly higher freauencies and/or power levels. In addition to their use as radio-freouency generators in <article acceler-ators, grid-controlled power tubes are also applicable as pulse modulators and amplitude regulators. The unique advantages of gridded power tubes for particle accelerators are discussed...|$|R
2500|$|A {{graduate}} student, M. Stanley Livingston, {{did much}} of the work of translating the idea into working hardware. Lawrence read an article about the concept of a drift tube linac by Rolf Widerøe, who had also been working along similar lines with the betatron concept. At the Radiation Laboratory of the University of California at Berkeley Lawrence constructed a series of cyclotrons which were the most powerful accelerators in the world at the time; a [...] 4.8MeV machine (1932), a [...] 8MeV machine (1937), and a [...] 16MeV machine (1939). He also developed a [...] <b>synchrocyclotron</b> (1945). Lawrence received the 1939 Nobel prize in physics for this work.|$|E
2500|$|In 1946, Fred Seitz, head of {{the physics}} {{department}} at Carnegie Tech, recruited Ed Creutz, Jack Fox, Roger Sutton and Bert Corben to the university to develop an important nuclear physics research program. By June 6, 1946, they had built a leading-edge, 450 MeV proton <b>synchrocyclotron</b> at the Nuclear Research Center near Saxonburg, {{just south of the}} city limits. The research program flourished up to the mid-1970s. By then the accelerator had become obsolete and was dismantled. The site was converted to industrial purposes, and is now occupied by II-VI Corporation. [...] As of 1997, only {{one or two of the}} original Nuclear Research Center buildings remained intact, including the original laboratory building.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} {{converted}} hangar that housed ZETA was the Harwell <b>Synchrocyclotron</b> effort run by Basil Rose. This project had also constructed a sensitive high-pressure diffusion cloud chamber as the cyclotron's main detector. Rose was convinced {{it would be}} able to directly measure the neutron energies and trajectories. In a series of experiments, he showed that the neutrons had a high directionality, at odds with a fusion origin which would be expected to be randomly directed. To further demonstrate this he had the machine run [...] "backwards", with the electric current running in the opposite direction. This demonstrated a clear difference in the number of neutrons and their energy, which suggested they were a result of the electrical current itself, not fusion reactions inside the plasma.|$|E
5000|$|Yuasa {{returned}} to France in May 1949 {{as a researcher}} for the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) while remaining a professor-on-leave at Ochanomizu University. She decided to stay in France permanently in 1955, resigning from her post at Ochanomizu. At the CNRS, she began research into beta decay using a Wilson chamber, and published a 1954 article warning {{of the dangers of}} hydrogen-bomb testing at Bikini Atoll. She was promoted to maître de recherche (chief researcher) at CNRS in 1957. Her research shifted into nuclear reactions using <b>synchrocyclotrons</b> around 1960, and in 1962 she received a doctorate in science from Kyoto University for her thesis, [...] "Étude du type d’invariant de l’interaction Gamow-Teller en désintégration β− de 6He" [...] (Form of Gamow-Teller invariant interaction on beta decay of 6He).|$|R
40|$|Fixed Field Alternating Gradient accelerators (FFAGs) offer higher pulse {{repetition}} rates and acceptances than synchrotrons – and therefore much higher beam intensities. With a fixed magnetic field the rep rate is set by purely rf considerations, {{and can be}} several kHz, while the radially extended spiral orbit and high momentum compaction lead to large radial and momentum acceptances – {{at the cost of}} somewhat wider vacuum chambers, magnets and rf cavities. With fixed magnetic fields, modulated rf, and pulsed beams, FFAGs operate just like <b>synchrocyclotrons,</b> but are capable of reaching tens of GeV. The innovations were to break the magnet into radial or spiral sectors to provide edge and strong focusing, and (usually) to remove the central region – the same steps that convert a classic Lawrence cyclotron into a separated-sector isochronous ring cyclotron. The FFAG is the most general type of fixed-field accelerator (cyclotron). Table 1 : Fixed magnetic field accelerators – the cyclotron family. Magnetic field-azimuthal variatio...|$|R
2500|$|The spiral {{path of the}} {{cyclotron}} beam {{can only}} [...] "sync up" [...] with klystron-type (constant frequency) voltage sources if the accelerated particles are approximately obeying Newton's laws of motion. If the particles become fast enough that relativistic effects become important, the beam becomes out of phase with the oscillating electric field, and cannot receive any additional acceleration. The classical cyclotron is therefore only capable of accelerating particles up to a few percent {{of the speed of}} light. To accommodate increased mass the magnetic field may be modified by appropriately shaping the pole pieces as in the isochronous cyclotrons, operating in a pulsed mode and changing the frequency applied to the dees as in the <b>synchrocyclotrons,</b> either of which is limited by the diminishing cost effectiveness of making larger machines. Cost limitations have been overcome by employing the more complex synchrotron or modern, klystron-driven linear accelerators, both of which have the advantage of scalability, offering more power within an improved cost structure as the machines are made larger.|$|R
2500|$|A {{cyclotron}} {{is a type}} {{of particle}} accelerator invented by Ernest O. Lawrence in 1934 in which charged particles accelerate outwards from the centre along a spiral path. The particles are held to a spiral trajectory by a static magnetic field and accelerated by a rapidly varying (radio frequency) electric field. Lawrence was awarded the 1939 Nobel prize in physics for this invention. Cyclotrons were the most powerful particle accelerator technology until the 1950s when they were superseded by the synchrotron, and are still used to produce particle beams in physics and nuclear medicine. The largest single-magnet cyclotron was the [...] <b>synchrocyclotron</b> built between 1940 and 1946 by Lawrence at the University of California at Berkeley, which could accelerate protons to 730MeV. The largest cyclotron is the [...] multimagnet TRIUMF accelerator at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia which can produce 500MeV protons.|$|E
2500|$|Stereotactic {{radiosurgery}} {{was first}} developed in 1949 by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell to treat small {{targets in the}} brain that were not amenable to conventional surgery. The initial stereotactic instrument he conceived used probes and electrodes. The first attempt to supplant the electrodes with radiation {{was made in the}} early fifties, with x-rays. The principle of this instrument was to hit the intra-cranial target with narrow beams of radiation from multiple directions. The beam paths converge in the target volume, delivering a lethal cumulative dose of radiation there, while limiting the dose to the adjacent healthy tissue. Ten years later significant progress had been made, due in considerable measure to the contribution of the physicists Kurt Liden and Börje Larsson. [...] At this time, stereotactic proton beams had replaced the x-rays. The heavy particle beam presented as an excellent replacement for the surgical knife, but the <b>synchrocyclotron</b> was too clumsy. Leksell proceeded to develop a practical, compact, precise and simple tool which could be handled by the surgeon himself. In 1968 this resulted in the Gamma Knife, which was installed at the Karolinska Institute and consisted of several cobalt-60 radioactive sources placed in a kind of helmet with central channels for irradiation with gamma rays. This prototype was designed to produce slit-like radiation lesions for functional neurosurgical procedures to treat pain, movement disorders, or behavioral disorders that did not respond to conventional treatment. The success of this first unit led to the construction of a second device, containing 179 cobalt-60 sources. This second Gamma Knife unit was designed to produce spherical lesions to treat brain tumors and intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). In the 1980s the third and fourth units (with 201 cobalt-60 sources) were installed in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Sheffield, England. The fifth Gamma Knife was installed at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pittsburgh in 1987.|$|E
50|$|After {{the first}} <b>synchrocyclotron</b> was operational, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) funded two <b>synchrocyclotron</b> {{construction}} initiatives. The first funding was in 1946 for Carnegie Institute of Technology {{to build a}} 435-MeV <b>synchrocyclotron</b> led by Edward Creutz and to start its nuclear physics research program. The second initiative was in 1947 for University of Chicago to build a 450-MeV <b>synchrocyclotron</b> {{under the direction of}} Enrico Fermi.|$|E
50|$|In 1950 the 435-MeV <b>synchrocyclotron</b> at Carnegie Institute of Technology was operational, {{followed}} by 450-MeV <b>synchrocyclotron</b> of University of Chicago in 1951.|$|E
50|$|In 1948, University of Rochester {{completed}} {{the construction of}} its 240-MeV <b>synchrocyclotron,</b> followed by a completion of 380-MeV <b>synchrocyclotron</b> at Columbia University in 1950.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two major}} {{differences}} between the <b>synchrocyclotron</b> and the classical cyclotron. In the <b>synchrocyclotron,</b> only one dee (hollow [...] "D"-shaped sheet metal electrode) retains its classical shape, while the other pole is open (see patent sketch). Furthermore, the frequency of oscillating electric field in a <b>synchrocyclotron</b> is decreasing continuously instead of kept constant so as to maintain cyclotron resonance for relativistic velocities. One terminal of the oscillating electric potential varying periodically {{is applied to the}} dee and the other terminal is on ground potential. The protons or deuterons to be accelerated are made to move in circles of increasing radius. The acceleration of particles takes place as they enter or leave the dee. At the outer edge, the ion beam can be removed with the aid of electrostatic deflector. The first <b>synchrocyclotron</b> produced 195 MeV deuterons and 390 MeV α-particles with the first <b>synchrocyclotron.</b>|$|E
