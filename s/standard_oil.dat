5|$|In March 1906, Commissioner of Corporations James Rudolph Garfield {{submitted}} {{a report to}} President Roosevelt, alleging large-scale rebating in <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil</b> shipments. Federal prosecutors in several states and territories sought indictments against components of the <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil</b> Trust. On June 28, 1906, <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil</b> of Indiana was indicted on 6,428counts of violation of the Elkins Act for accepting rebates on shipments on the Chicago & Alton Railroad. The case was assigned to Landis.|$|E

5|$|With {{facilities}} {{prepared in}} Jakarta, Singapore, Bangkok, Saigon, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Kobe, the fledgling Shell company {{was ready to}} become <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil's</b> first challenger in the Asian market. On August 24, 1892, Murex became the first tanker {{to pass through the}} Suez Canal. By the time Shell merged with Royal Dutch Petroleum in 1907, the company had 34 steam-driven oil tankers, compared to <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil's</b> four case-oil steamers and 16 sailing tankers.|$|R

Currents and single rate are the quantities most affected by the surface treatment of the electrodes beyond the optical/mechanical properties. A factor 4 less in currents and at least a factor 10 less in single rate is achieved using <b>standard</b> <b>oiled</b> RPCs operated in streamer mode...|$|R
5|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, a number of {{business}} entities had formed themselves into trusts, which dominated their industries. Trusts often sought to purchase or otherwise neutralize their competitors, allowing the conglomerates to raise prices to high levels. In 1890, Congress had passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but it was not until the Theodore Roosevelt administration (1901–09) that serious efforts were made to break up or control the trusts. The dominant force in the oil industry was <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil,</b> controlled by John D. Rockefeller. Modern-day Exxon, Mobil, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Sohio, Amoco and Continental Oil all trace their ancestry to various parts of <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>Oil</b> {{moved its}} {{headquarters}} to New York City at 26 Broadway, and Rockefeller became {{a central figure}} in the city's business community. He bought a residence in 1884 on 54th Street near the mansions of other magnates such as William Henry Vanderbilt. Despite personal threats and constant pleas for charity, Rockefeller took the new elevated train to his downtown office daily. In 1887, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission which was tasked with enforcing equal rates for all railroad freight, but by then Standard depended more on pipeline transport. More threatening to Standard's power was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, originally used to control unions, but later central to {{the breakup of the}} <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil</b> trust. Ohio was especially vigorous in applying its state anti-trust laws, and finally forced a separation of <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil</b> of Ohio {{from the rest of the}} company in 1892, the first step in the dissolution of the trust.|$|E

5|$|Gulf Oil LP (the Cumberland Farms-owned {{successor}} to the original Gulf Oil after <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil</b> of California—now Chevron—bought Gulf in 1984) replaced the Exxon stations on the turnpike in 1990; Sunoco took over operation of the gas stations from Gulf in 1993, outbidding Shell Oil. In 1995, a farmers market {{was introduced to the}} Sideling Hill service plaza.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1870, Rockefeller {{abolished}} the partnership of Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler, forming <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil</b> of Ohio. Continuing to apply {{his work ethic}} and efficiency, Rockefeller quickly expanded the company {{to be the most}} profitable refiner in Ohio. Likewise, it became one of the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads competed fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company offering special deals to bulk customers like <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil,</b> outside the main oil centers. The cartel offered preferential treatment as a high-volume shipper, which included not just steep discounts/rebates of up to 50% for their product but rebates for the shipment of competing products.|$|E

5|$|<b>Standard</b> <b>Oil</b> {{initially}} {{chose not}} to become directly involved in oil production in Texas, and instead formed Security Oil Company as a refining operation utilizing Guffey-Gulf and Texas Company as suppliers. Following state lawsuits related to anti-trust statutes, Security Oil was reorganized into Magnolia Petroleum Company in 1911. That same year, the Humble Oil Company (today Exxon Corporation) was formed by Ross Sterling and Walter William Fondren in Humble, Texas. The headquarters were moved to Houston, and the company eventually sold half of its shares to <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil</b> of New Jersey, establishing a long-term partnership that lasted for decades. The company built the Baytown Refinery, which became Texas' largest refining operation. In the post-World War II period, Humble became the largest crude oil transporter in the United States, and built pipelines connecting Baytown to Dallas-Fort Worth and West Texas to the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Bahrain Petroleum Company (Bapco), a {{subsidiary}} of the <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil</b> Company of California (Socal), discovered oil in 1931 and production began the following year. This was to bring rapid modernisation to Bahrain. Relations with the United Kingdom became closer, as evidenced by the British Royal Navy moving its entire Middle Eastern command from Bushehr in Iran to Bahrain in 1935.|$|E
5|$|The first {{refining}} {{operations at}} Corsicana were built by Joseph S. Cullinan, a former manager for <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil</b> in Pennsylvania. His company, which was later absorbed by Magnolia Petroleum Company and then acquired by <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil</b> of New York, {{built the first}} modern refinery west of the Mississippi River. Following the strike at Spindletop, Cullinan partnered with Arnold Schlaet to form the Texas Fuel Company in Beaumont with funding from an investment group run by former Texas governor James S. Hogg and other investors. In 1905, as the new company rapidly expanded its operations, it moved its corporate headquarters to Houston. The company's strength {{in the oil industry}} established Houston as the center of the industry in Texas. The company was later absorbed into the Texas Company and then renamed Texaco.|$|E
5000|$|While some {{scholars}} have agreed with Justice Harlan's characterization of prior case law, others have agreed with William Howard Taft, who concluded that despite its different verbal formulation, <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil's</b> [...] "rule of reason" [...] was entirely consistent with prior case law.|$|R

Although she was leaking slightly, Montanan continued {{on to her}} destination, and put in for repairs after a return trip to New York.|$|E
5|$|For decades, Gulf {{operated}} filling stations on the Pennsylvania Turnpike toll {{highway system}} alongside the Howard Johnson's restaurants at the Turnpike's travel plazas (which correspond to European motorway service areas). This began in 1950 {{with the opening}} of the Philadelphia Extension, and Gulf added more filling stations as the system was extended. The <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil</b> Company of Pennsylvania (now part of Exxon) had exclusive rights to provide filling station services on the sections of the system that opened prior to 1950, principally the Irwin-to-Carlisle section.|$|E
5|$|Gulf Oil Corporation (GOC) {{ceased to}} exist as an {{independent}} company in 1985, when it merged with <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil</b> of California (SOCAL), with both re-branding as Chevron in the United States. Gulf Canada, Gulf's main Canadian subsidiary, was sold the same year with retail outlets to Ultramar and Petro Canada and what became Gulf Canada Resources to Olympia & York. However, the Gulf brand name {{and a number of}} the constituent business divisions of GOC survived. Gulf has experienced a significant revival since 1990, emerging as a flexible network of allied business interests based on partnerships, franchises and agencies.|$|E

5|$|The maximum fine that Landis could impose was $29,240,000. To aid {{the judge}} in {{determining}} the sentence, Landis issued a subpoena for Rockefeller to testify as to <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil's</b> assets. The tycoon had often evaded subpoenas, not having testified in court since 1888. Deputy United States marshals visited Rockefeller's several homes, {{as well as the}} estates of his friends, in the hope of finding him. After several days, Rockefeller was found at his lawyer's estate, Taconic Farm in northwestern Massachusetts, and was served with the subpoena. The tycoon duly came to Landis's Chicago courtroom, making his way through a mob anxious to see the proceedings. Rockefeller's actual testimony, proffered after the judge made him wait through several cases and witnesses, proved to be anticlimactic, as he professed almost no knowledge of <b>Standard</b> <b>Oil's</b> corporate structure or assets.|$|R
