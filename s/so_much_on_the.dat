Reaction to the team in the south, where the public school establishment controlled the game, was less positive, and the sportsmanship of the team was criticised. Despite this, Ellison clearly enjoyed the experience of touring with the team, and in 1902 he wrote—"I shall never forget the trip, notwithstanding the extremely heavy programme of fixtures {{we had to go}} through. Perhaps the most delightful part of our experiences was tasted not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field of play as off it".|$|E

25|$|For a {{brief period}} in mid-1996 a {{vigorous}} debate was ignited in Mexico when it emerged that Guillermo Schulenburg, who {{at that time was}} 80 years of age, did not believe that Juan Diego was a historical person or (which follows from it) that it is his mantle which is conserved and venerated at the Basilica. That debate, however, was focused not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> weight to be accorded to the historical sources which attest to Juan Diego's existence as on the propriety of Abbot Schulenburg retaining an official position which – so it was objected – his advanced age, allegedly extravagant life-style and heterodox views disqualified him from holding. Abbot Schulenburg's resignation (announced on September 6, 1996) terminated that debate. The scandal, however, re-erupted in January 2002 when the Italian journalist Andrea Tornielli published in the Italian newspaper Il Giornale a confidential letter dated December 4, 2001 which Schulenburg (among others) had sent to Cardinal Sodano, the then Secretary of State at the Vatican, reprising reservations over the historicity of Juan Diego.|$|E
25|$|I {{never did}} {{know exactly what}} was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the {{original}} meeting, association, comradeship of Allen , myself, Michael , Lawrence , Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory , for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory {{as well as the}} others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come really close together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which none of us had any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's very interesting that we find ourselves <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.|$|E

Its soundtrack was composed by Nobuo Uematsu and Yasunori Mitsuda, with additional tracks provided by Junya Nakano and Masashi Hamauzu. The soundtrack was the second collaboration between Nobuo Uematsu and Yasunori Mitsuda, after Chrono Trigger. According to Uematsu, Mitsuda worked <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack that he eventually had to be hospitalized. The soundtrack has a [...] "mechanical" [...] theme to its music, and incorporates both electronic and traditional instruments. The music from the game was released on an album titled Front Mission Series: Gun Hazard Original Sound Track. It was released by NTT Publishing on February 25, 1996. The two-disc album has 60 tracks, is 2:30:25 long, and has catalog numbers of PSCN-5044~5.|$|E
500|$|Murphy {{has said}} that he has never seen a High School Musical film, to which Glee has been compared, and that his {{interest}} lay in creating a [...] "postmodern musical", rather than [...] "doing a show where people burst into song", drawing more heavily on the format of Chicago. Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism. [...] "There's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. This is a different genre, there's nothing like it on the air at the networks and cable. Everything's so dark in the world right now, that's why Idol worked. It's pure escapism," [...] he said. Murphy intended to make a family show to appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads, and as of October 2009 he had already mapped out plans for the series covering three years of broadcast.|$|E
500|$|Joss Whedon's {{impetus to}} create [...] "Hush" [...] was his {{reaction}} to hearing that the primary reason behind Buffys success was the dialogue. He {{felt that he was}} stagnating as a director, turning into a [...] "hack" [...] by making formulaic episodes. Whedon tended to concentrate <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> visual aspects of the series' production that he was chastised by Fox executives in earlier seasons. Thus, writing and producing [...] "Hush" [...] depended almost solely on visuals and not on dialogue, a prospect that Whedon found terrifying, worried that viewers would find the episode boring. Much like the fourth-season finale [...] "Restless"—which consisted almost entirely of dream sequences—and the sixth season musical [...] "Once More, with Feeling", Whedon was certain he would fail at attempting to present the show in such a novel way. Initially, this was to be the episode where Riley and Buffy have sex, and Whedon took comfort in that plan because he knew people would not mind the silence, but ultimately he decided it was too early for the characters to sleep together, and he scrapped the idea.|$|E

500|$|Taft {{has been}} rated among the {{greatest}} of the chief justices; later Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia noted that this was [...] "not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of his opinions, perhaps because many of them ran counter to the ultimate sweep of history". A successor as chief justice, Earl Warren, concurred: [...] "In Taft's case, the symbol, the tag, the label usually attached to him is 'conservative.' It is certainly not of itself a term of opprobrium even when bandied by the critics, but its use is too often confused with 'reactionary.'" [...] Most commentators agree that as chief justice, Taft's most significant contribution was his advocacy for reform of the high court, urging and ultimately gaining improvement in the court's procedures and facilities. Mason cited enactment of the Judges' Bill of 1925 as Taft's major achievement on the court. According to Anderson, Taft as chief justice [...] "was as aggressive {{in the pursuit of}} his agenda in the judicial realm as Theodore Roosevelt was in the presidential".|$|E
500|$|The {{daughter}} of billionaire Nikolas Natchios {{and the love}} interest of Matt Murdock. At a very young age, she witnessed {{the murder of her}} mother, and since then her father has had her become highly trained in martial arts. For the role of Elektra, many actresses were looked into with considerations including Penélope Cruz, Salma Hayek, Natalie Portman, Lucy Liu, Jessica Alba, and Katie Holmes. A short-list was eventually made, giving the choices of Jennifer Garner, Jolene Blalock, Mía Maestro and Rhona Mitra, with Garner finally becoming the actress to land the role. Garner said of the character, [...] "I think she's strong and cool and beautiful and smart. She'd be a good role model." [...] Garner noted the costume would be different, as Elektra in comics often wears red satin but in the film wears black leather. Garner explained, [...] "he red would never have worked for hiding a harness, and I know this sounds ridiculous, but you have to protect your skin a little bit. They throw me around <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rooftop [...] I got cut through the leather, so imagine if I hadn't had anything." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} women and death is evident in stories as early as [...] "Indian Camp". The theme of death {{permeates}} Hemingway's work. Young believes the emphasis in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] was not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> woman who gives birth or the father who commits suicide, but on Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a [...] "badly scarred and nervous young man". Hemingway sets the events in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] that shape the Adams persona. Young believes [...] "Indian Camp" [...] holds the [...] "master key" [...] to [...] "what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career". Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's work to be more complex with {{a representation of the}} truth inherent in existentialism: if [...] "nothingness" [...] is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life. Francis Macomber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic; the bullfighter in the corrida represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity. In his paper The Uses of Authenticity: Hemingway and the Literary Field, Timo Müller writes that Hemingway's fiction is successful because the characters live an [...] "authentic life", and the [...] "soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature".|$|E

500|$|Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan created Glee. Murphy drew {{inspiration}} from his own childhood, which saw him play the lead role {{in all of his}} high school's musicals. Brennan and producer Mike Novick were also highly involved in their own schools' glee clubs. Brennan originally wrote a script for a Glee movie, but Murphy believed the concept would work better as a TV series. Fox picked up the series pilot within 15 hours of receiving the script, which Murphy attributes in part {{to the success of the}} network's American Idol, commenting: [...] "It made sense for the network with the biggest hit in TV, which is a musical, to do something in that vein". Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism, explaining: [...] "There's <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. This is a different genre, there's nothing like it on the air at the networks and cable. Everything's so dark in the world right now, that's why 'Idol' worked. It's pure escapism." [...] With regards to Glee audience, Murphy intended for it to be a family show which would appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads. Glee is set in Lima, Ohio. Murphy chose a Midwest setting as he himself originates from Indiana, and recalls childhood visits to Ohio to the Kings Island theme park. Although set in Lima, the show is actually filmed at Paramount Studios in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|The South Vietnamese {{eventually}} {{had their}} way. As the generals and Hương {{were unwilling to}} reinstate the HNC, Taylor sent General John L. Throckmorton to meet them and mend relations. Throckmorton told the Vietnamese generals they had read too much into Taylor's comments and that the US {{had no intention of}} pressuring them out of power with aid cuts. Cang appeared unimpressed, while Thiệu and Kỳ made indirect and vague comments about what they perceived to be misleading tactics during the talks. Khánh appeared reassured by Throckmorton's overtures and made a public statement on December 30, saying he was not as hostile to the Americans as reported, and he wanted Thiệu and Cang to meet the Americans to relieve any remaining tension. He also claimed privately that the statements attributed to him by Deepe were false and set up a bilateral committee to discuss tensions. The generals eventually won out, as the Americans did not move against them in any way for their refusal to reinstate the HNC. The South Vietnamese won in large part because the Americans had spent <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> country, and could not afford to abandon it and lose to the communists over the matter of military rule, as a communist takeover would be a big public relations coup for the Soviet bloc. According to Karnow, for Khánh and his officers, [...] "their weakness was their strength".
