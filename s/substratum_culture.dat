40|$|In mKSA cells (a {{simian virus}} 40 -transformed BALB/c mouse tumor cell line), plasma membrane-associated large T antigen (large T) {{is found in}} two subfractions of the plasma membrane; a minor amount of large T is {{recovered}} from the Nonidet P- 40 (NP- 40) -soluble plasma membrane fraction, whereas the majority is tightly bound to a substructure of the plasma membrane, the plasma membrane lamina (PML). Only PML-associated large T is fatty acid acylated (U. Klockmann and W. Deppert, EMBO J. 2 : 1151 - 1157, 1983). We have analyzed whether these two forms of plasma membrane-associated large T might differ in features like cell surface expression or metabolic stability. In addition, we have asked whether {{one of the two}} large Ts might represent the hypothetic, large T-related protein T* (D. F. Mark and P. Berg, Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 44 : 55 - 62, 1979). We show that in mKSA cells grown in suspension culture, large T associated with the PML is also exposed on the cell surface. This form of large T, therefore, exhibits properties of a transmembrane protein. Large T in the NP- 40 -soluble plasma membrane fraction could not be labeled with radioiodine on the cell surface and, for this reason, {{does not seem to be}} oriented towards the cell surface. In contrast, when mKSA cells were grown on <b>substratum</b> (<b>culture</b> dish), we found that in these cells both NP- 40 -soluble large T as well as large T anchored in the PML could be cell surface iodinated. We also have analyzed the plasma membrane association of surface T antigen in mKSA cells grown in a mouse as ascites tumor. In tumor cells, only PML-bound large T is cell surface associated. We conclude that differences in extractibility of cell surface-associated large T most likely depend on cell shape and are not an artifact of cell culture. Both NP- 40 -soluble and PML-bound large Ts are associated with the plasma membrane in a metabolically stable fashion. Neither of the two large Ts represents T*...|$|E

Intact non-dissociated trigeminal ganglia extend neurites only when co-cultured with target tissues and not in isolation. We set out to determine if intact early age murine trigeminal ganglia extend neurites in isolation, is it the culture system involved and whether fibroblast inhibitors could actually prevent the normal outgrowth pattern. Mouse intact trigeminal ganglia before target innervation were given the choice to grow in isolation or with target tissues on three dimensional collagen gels, collagen coated platform and poly-d-lysine <b>substrata.</b> <b>Cultures</b> in this way were {{set up in the}} presence and absence of fibroblast inhibitors. Results demonstrated that; firstly, trigeminal ganglia were capable of extending neurites in isolation, Secondly, poly-d-lysine promoted extensive outgrowth of neurites, a comparable outgrowth was promoted by collagen substrata but not three-dimensional collagen gels. Thirdly, inhibitors used to prevent fibroblast outgrowth radically affected the normal outgrowth pattern of neurite fascicles and morphology. Where fibroblast inhibitors were omitted, neurites grew to several hundred micrometers distance, highly branched and established intricate neurite-non-neuronal networks. Growth cones and filopodia were well developed. Additionally, widespread outgrowth occurred only where ganglia were cultured within the first five or ten minutes after removal from embryos. Lastly, outgrowth of non-neuronal non-fibroblast cells occurred only when ganglia were cultured without fibroblast inhibitors. We conclude that evaluation of in vitro axon outgrowth and directionality should be cautious...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} effects of human {{intervertebral}} disc aggrecan on nerve growth and guidance, using in vitro techniques. Methods: Aggrecan extracted from human lumbar intervertebral discs was incorporated into tissue <b>culture</b> <b>substrata</b> for the <b>culture</b> of the human neuronal cell line, SH-SY 5 Y, or explants of chick dorsal root ganglia. The effects on nerve growth of different concentrations of aggrecan extracted from the anulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus, and of these aggrecan preparations following enzymic deglycosylation, were compared. Results: Disc aggrecan inhibited the growth of neurites from SH-SY 5 Y cells and induced growth cone turning of chick sensory neurites in a concentration-dependent manner. Aggrecan isolated from the anulus fibrosus was more inhibitory than that isolated from the nucleus pulposus, but enzymic pretreatments to reduce the glycosylation of both types of disc aggrecan partially abrogated their inhibitory effects. Conclusion: Nerve growth into degenerate intervertebral discs has been linked {{with the development of}} low back pain, but little is known about factors affecting disc innervation. The finding that disc aggrecan inhibits nerve growth in vitro, and that this inhibitory activity depends on aggrecan glycosylation, has important implications for our understanding of mechanisms that may regulate disc innervation in health and disease...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical cues such as {{extracellular}} matrix stiffness and movement {{have a major}} impact on cell differentiation and function. To replicate these biological features in vitro, soft substrata with tunable elasticity and the possibility for controlled surface translocation are desirable. Here we report on the use of ultra-soft (Young’s modulus < 100 kPa) PDMS-based magnetoactive elastomers (MAE) as suitable cell <b>culture</b> <b>substrata.</b> Soft non-viscous PDMS (< 18 kPa) is produced using a modified extended crosslinker. MAEs are generated by embedding magnetic microparticles into a soft PDMS matrix. Both substrata yield an elasticity-dependent (14 vs. 100 kPa) modulation of ?-smooth muscle actin expression in primary human fibroblasts. To allow for static or dynamic control of MAE material properties, we devise low magnetic field (? 40 mT) stimulation systems compatible with cell-culture environments. Magnetic field-instigated stiffening (14 to 200 kPa) of soft MAE enhances the spreading of primary human fibroblasts and decreases PAX- 7 transcription in human mesenchymal stem cells. Pulsatile MAE movements are generated using oscillating magnetic fields and are well tolerated by adherent human fibroblasts. This MAE system provides spatial and temporal control of substratum material characteristics and permits novel designs when used as dynamic cell <b>culture</b> <b>substrata</b> or cell culture-coated actuator in tissue engineering applications or biomedical devices...|$|R

GO coatings were prepared on the substrata using a modified dip-coating procedure. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy results demonstrated that the as-prepared coatings in this study were homogeneous and had an average thickness of similar to 67 nm. The rapid formation of a hydroxyapatite (HA) layer in the simulated body fluid (SBF) on GO coated substrata at day 14, as proved by SEM and x-ray diffraction (XRD), strongly indicated the bioactivity of coated substrata. In addition, MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells were cultured on the coated substrata to evaluate cellular activities. Compared with the non-coated <b>substrata</b> and tissue <b>culture</b> plates, no significant difference was observed on the coated substrata in terms of cytotoxicity, viability, proliferation and apoptosis. However, interestingly, higher levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin (OC) secretion were observed on the coated substrata, indicating that GO coatings enhanced cell differentiation compared with non-coated <b>substrata</b> and tissue <b>culture</b> plates. This study suggests that GO coatings had excellent biocompatibility and more importantly promoted MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cell differentiation and might be a good candidate as a coating material for orthopedic implants...|$|R
40|$|Heart-cell {{conditioned}} medium (HCM) induces rapid neurite outgrowth from isolated neurons in culture. The following {{evidence indicates}} that this action of HCM {{is due to a}} trypsin-sensitive factor which attaches to the polyornithinecoated culture substratum: (i) Pretreatment of the <b>culture</b> <b>substratum</b> with HCM allows rapid neurite outgrowth to occur even in unconditioned media. The active factor remains bound to the substratum during the period of neurite outgrowth. (ii) The substratum-bound activity is destroyed by trypsin treatment, but is insensitive to collagenase, RNase, and DNase. (iii) The factor that binds to the substratum is essential for neurite outgrowth, because HCM is no longer active when the material that binds to the polyornithine substratum has been removed by passage of the HCM over a series of culture dishes. However, this “depleted” HCM is still able to support the growth of nonneuronal cells. (iv) Most significantly, when neurons are cultured in whole HCM, the extent of neurite outgrowth is proportional to the amount of substratum-bound activity and not to the amount in solution, indicating that the substratum-bound form of the factor is more active. Previous observations [Collins, F. (1978) Dev. Biol. 65, 50 - 57] suggest that HCM promotes neurite outgrowth by increasing the adhesion between nerve cell surface extensions and the polyornithine-coated <b>culture</b> <b>substratum.</b> It is possible, therefore, that the factor in HCM that binds to the substratum possesses sites to which nerve cell surface components adhere...|$|R
40|$|Thin, sub-micron, {{films of}} calcium {{phosphate}} were fabricated on either glass or quartz supports by a colloidal suspension sol-gel method. These films, which varied in both surface chemistry and topography were then employed as <b>culture</b> <b>substrata</b> for osteogenic rat bone marrow cells. During an 18 day culture period, the cells elaborated a morphologically distinguishable bone matrix on all substrata which {{was similar to}} that reported earlier on tissue culture polystyrene. Selected samples of the <b>culture</b> <b>substrata</b> were fractured, critical point dried, and observed by scanning electron microscopy. Particular attention was paid to the morphologies of the interface between the so 1 -gellayer and the underlying support, and that between the sol-gel layer and the elaborated bone tissue. The mechanical disruption of both tissue and thin films resulting from critical point drying affected the morphology of both interfaces dependent upon the film processing conditions. The interfacial bone matrix, which was a cement-line like matrix, interdigitated with the surface of the films. This mechanical interdigitation created a bond which remained intact during tissue processing. With films processed at 1000 °C on quartz supports, but not with those processed at lower temperatures on glass, fracture of the interface revealed pitting in the quartz surface which was associated with areas of adherence of the overlying calcium phosphate film. These preliminary studies demonstrate the intimate relationship which can be established between such thin calcium phosphate thin films and bone matrix...|$|R

OBs cultured on 3 D displayed increased proliferation, differentiation, and matrix protein synthesis, when compared to 2 D cultures on the same <b>substrata.</b> Confluent <b>cultures,</b> however, could not be maintained for long, due to insufficient fluid diffusion within 3 D scaffolds that impaired cell viability. Thus, confluent OB 3 D cultures were implanted on the allantochorial membrane of chick embryos.

In the absence of OBs, when the biomaterial alone was implanted, blood vessels were still present but hematopoietic marrow was absent. In both cases osteoclasts (OCs) derived from the host were found on the implant surface. These results indicated that scaffolds with cells can be easily vascularized and confirmed the role of OBs in the definition of the microenvironment that induce blood marrow differentiation in the intratrabecular spaces...|$|R

40|$|Sub-micron calcium {{phosphate}} ceramic thin films were formed by vertically dipping transparent quartz plates in a particulate sol-gel suspension. Primary adult rat bone marrow cell populations were cultured on the ceramic thin films in conditions known {{to allow the}} differentiation of cells of the osteoclast lineage. Monitoring the cultures for periods of 11 to 28 days revealed the creation of resorption lacunae in the thin films by multinucleate cells. Some cultures were heated at 42 °C overnight to remove adherent cells; using bright field light microscopy (LM), after staining with silver nitrate, the degree of resorption could be easily assessed. Other cultures were fixed and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity and prepared for LM and/ or scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Examination of the cultures, following fixation, showed the multinucleate cells associated with resorption lacunae to be TRAP positive. The nuclearity of the cells varied considerably. SEM showed that the cells had resorbed the thin films to produce discrete resorption lacunae {{similar to those found}} in normal bone tissue. From their morphology, TRAP positive staining, and resorptive activity, the cells were considered to be osteoclasts. The size of individual or combined lacunae varied from 3 ̆c 10 μm to - 1 mm. These thin film <b>culture</b> <b>substrata</b> may be employed to investigate the function of individual resorbing cells or, especially after removal of the adherent cell layer, easily quantify resorption which is the major functional activity of osteoclasts.

Scraping of cells from the tissue <b>culture</b> <b>substratum</b> at 37 degrees C was used to test this possibility. We show that scraping closely mimics in vitro both the transient plasma membrane wounds observed in cells subject to mechanical forces in vivo (McNeil, P. L., and S. Ito. 1989. Gastroenterology. 96 : 1238 - 1248) and the transient plasma membrane wounds shown here to occur in endothelial cells under normal culturing conditions. Scraping of endothelial cells from the <b>culturing</b> <b>substratum</b> released into the culture medium a potent growth-promoting activity for Swiss 3 T 3 fibroblasts. Growth-promoting activity was released rapidly (within 5 min) after scraping but was not subsequently degraded by the endothelial cells for at least 24 h thereafter. A greater quantity of growth-promoting activity was released by cells scraped 4 h after plating than by those scraped 4 or 7 d afterwards. Thus release is not due to scraping-induced disruption of extracellular matrix. Release was only partially cold inhibitable, was poorly correlated with the level of cell death induced by scraping, and did not occur when cells were killed with metabolic poisons. These results suggest that mechanical disruption of plasma membrane, either transient or permanent, is the essential event leading to release. A basic fibroblast growth factor- like molecule and not platelet-derived growth factor appears to be partially responsible for the growth-promoting activity. We conclude that one biologically relevant route of release of basic fibroblast growth factor, a molecule which lacks the signal peptide sequence for transport into the endoplasmic reticulum, could be directly through mechanically induced membrane disruptions of endothelial cells growing in vivo and in vitro...|$|R

Radiolabelled glycosaminoglycans were then analysed in the spent media and trypsin extracts from cells on plastic and in the medium, trypsin and collagenase extracts from cells on collagen gels. All enzyme extracts and spent media contained hyaluronic acid, heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate. Hyaluronic acid was the main 3 H-labelled component in media and enzyme extracts from cells on both substrata, although it was distributed mainly to the media fractions. Heparan sulphate was the major [35 S]sulphated glycosaminoglycan in trypsin extracts of cells on plastic, and dermatan sulphate was the minor component. In contrast, dermatan sulphate was the principal [35 S]sulphated glycosaminoglycan in trypsin and collagenase extracts of cells on collagen gels. The <b>culture</b> <b>substratum</b> also influenced the amounts of [35 S]sulphated glycosaminoglycans in media and enzyme extracts. With cells on plastic, the medium contained most of the heparan sulphate (75 %) and dermatan sulphate (> 90 %), whereas the collagenase extract was the main source of heparan sulphate (60 %) and dermatan sulphate (80 %) from cells on collagen gels; when cells were grown on collagen, the medium contained only 5 - 20 % of the total [35 S]sulphated glycosaminoglycans. Depletion of the medium pool was probably caused by binding of [35 S]sulphated glycosaminoglycans to the network of native collagen fibres that formed the insoluble fraction of the collagen gel. Furthermore, cells on collagen showed a 3 -fold increase in dermatan sulphate synthesis, which could be due to a positive-feedback mechanism activated by the accumulation of dermatan sulphate in the microenvironment of the cultured cells. For comparative structural analyses of glycosaminoglycans synthesized on different substrata labelling experiments were carried out by incubating cells on plastic with [3 H]glucosamine, and cells on collagen gels with [14 C]glucosamine. Co-chromatography on DEAE-cellulose of mixed media and enzyme extracts showed that heparan sulphate from cells on collagen gels eluted at a lower salt concentration than did heparan sulphate from cells on plastic, whereas with dermatan sulphate the opposite result was obtained, with dermatan sulphate from cells on collagen eluting at a higher salt concentration than dermatan sulphate from cells on plastic. These differences did not correspond to changes in the molecular size of the glycosaminoglycan chains, but they may be caused by alterations in polymer sulphation...|$|R

The asymmetric distribution of proteins between apical and adherence sides was also profiled. Apart from classical proteins with clear involvement in cell-material interactions, proteins previously not known to be involved in cell attachment were also discovered. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The lack of {{procedures}} for isolating or reconstituting intact focal adhesions has hindered studies of how focal adhesions are organized {{and of how}} their assembly/disassembly is controlled. A method for isolating large quantities of the ventral portion of plasma membranes from transformed keratinocytes (A- 431 cells) in culture is described. Plasma membranes are stabilized using Zn 2 + and the ventral portion isolated attached to the <b>culture</b> <b>substratum</b> after {{the body of the}} cell has been sheared away. Compared with complete plasma membranes isolated from cells scraped from the dish, these ventral-membrane preparations are enriched 18. 5 -fold and 5. 1 -fold in the focal-adhesion components talin and vinculin respectively. While the epidermal-growth-factor receptor-kinase is less abundant in preparations of ventral membranes, a recently described tyrosine kinase which localizes to focal adhesions in mouse fibroblasts is enriched 19. 9 -fold. Extracellular matrix components, as well as their integrin receptors, are also enriched in these preparations of the ventral portion of plasma membranes compared with preparations of complete plasma membranes...|$|R
40|$|Reported methane {{oxidation}} activity (MOA) {{varies widely}} for common landfill cover materials. Variation is expected due {{to differences in}} surface area, the composition of the <b>substratum</b> and <b>culturing</b> conditions. MOA per methanotrophic cell has been calculated in the study of natural systems such as lake sediments to examine the inherent conditions for methanotrophic activity. In this study, biomass normalised MOA (i. e., MOA per methanotophic cell) was measured on stabilised compost, a commonly used cover in landfills, and on graphite granules, an inert substratum widely used in microbial electrosynthesis studies. After initially enriching methanotrophs on both substrata, biomass normalised MOA was quantified under excess oxygen and limiting methane conditions in 160 ml serum vials on both substrata and blends of the substrata. Biomass concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid assay for microbial protein. The biomass normalised MOA as consistent across all compost-to-graphite granules blends, but varied with time, reflecting the growth phase of the microorganisms. The biomass normalised MOA ranged from 0. 069 +/- 0. 006 mu mol CH 4 /mg dry biomass/h during active growth, to 0. 024 +/- 0. 001 mol CH 4 /mg dry biomass/h for established biofilms regardless of the substrata employed, indicating the substrata were equally effective in terms of inherent composition. The correlation of MOA with biomass is consistent with studies on methanotrophic activity in natural systems, but biomass normalised MOA varies by over 5 orders of magnitude between studies. This is partially due to different methods being used to quantify biomass, such as pmoA gene quantification and the culture dependent Most Probable Number method, but also indicates that long term exposure of materials to a supply of methane in an aerobic environment, as can occur in natural systems, leads to the enrichment and adaptation of types suitable for those conditions.

40|$|Our aim was {{to replace}} the {{proteins}} and peptides, generally used for the biocompatibilization of polymer substrata, with synthetic molecules mimicking the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) active sequence. Based on the (L) -tyrosine template, RGD peptidomimetics were constructed; one molecule 3 was equipped with an anchorage arm that allowed its covalent grafting on a <b>culture</b> <b>substratum</b> made from poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) microporous membrane. The amount of fixed molecules was readily determined by XPS, using a fluorine tag incorporated in the peptidomimetic structure. The binding of peptidomimetics 1 - 3 to the vitronectin (VN) and fibronectin (FN) receptors could not be revealed in a test of inhibition of MSC 80 cells adhesion, by the synthetic compounds in solution placed in competition with the adhesive proteins (VN and FN) coating polystyrene plates. However, the cell-attachment activity of peptidomimetic 3 was shown by culturing CaCo 2 cells, {{in the absence of}} serum, on the PET substratum grafted with 3. The performance of this support was similar to that of PET grafted with the reference peptide RGDS (Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser), and only reduced by half comparatively to the PET grafted with FN...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMaintaining stable {{differentiated}} {{somatic cell}} function in culture {{is essential to}} a range of biological endeavors. However, current technologies, employing, for example, primary hepatic cell culture (essential {{to the development of a}} bio-artificial liver and improved drug and toxicology testing), are limited by supply, expense, and functional instability even on biological cell <b>culture</b> <b>substrata.</b> As such, novel biologically active substrates manufacturable to GMP standards have the potential to improve cell culture-based assay applications. Currently hepatic endoderm (HE) generated from pluripotent stem cells is a genotypically diverse, cheap, and stable source of “hepatocytes”; however, HE routine applications are limited due to phenotypic instability in culture. Therefore a manufacturable subcellular matrix capable of supporting long-term differentiated cell function would represent a step forward in developing scalable and phenotypically stable hESC-derived hepatocytes. Adopting an unbiased approach we screened polymer microarrays and identified a polyurethane matrix which promoted HE viability, hepatocellular gene expression, drug-inducible metabolism, and function. Moreover, the polyurethane supported, when coated on a clinically approved bio-artificial liver matrix, long-term hepatocyte function and growth. In conclusion, our data suggest that an unbiased screening approach can identify cell culture substrate(s) that enhance the phenotypic stability of primary and stem cell-derived cell resources...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In vitro ovarian {{follicle}} {{culture is a}} new frontier in assisted reproductive technology with tremendous potential, especially for fertility preservation. Folliculogenesis within the ovary is a complex process requiring interaction between somatic cell components and the oocyte. Conventional two-dimensional culture on tissue <b>culture</b> <b>substrata</b> impedes spherical growth and preservation of the spatial arrangements between oocyte and surrounding granulosa cells. Granulosa cell attachment and migration can leave the oocyte naked and unable to complete the maturation process. Recognition {{of the importance of}} spatial arrangements between cells has spurred research in to three-dimensional culture system. Such systems may be vital when dealing with human primordial follicles that may require as long as three months in culture. In the present work we review pertinent aspects of in vitro follicle maturation, with an emphasis on tissue-engineering solutions for maintaining the follicular unit during the culture interval. We focus primarily on presenting the various 3 -dimensional culture systems that have been applied for in vitro maturation of follicle:oocyte complexes. We also try to present an overview of outcomes with various biomaterials and animal models and also the limitations of the existing systems. </p...|$|R
40|$|Alix (ALG- 2 -interacting protein X), a cytoplasmic adaptor protein {{involved}} in endosomal sorting and actin cytoskeleton assembly, {{is required for}} the maintenance of fibroblast morphology. As Alix has sequence similarity to adhesin in Entamoeba histolytica, and we observed that Alix is secreted, we determined whether extracellular Alix affects fibroblast morphology. Here, we demonstrate that secreted Alix is deposited on the substratum of non-immortalized WI 38 fibroblasts. Antibody binding to extracellular Alix retards WI 38 cell adhesion and spreading on fibronectin and vitronectin. Alix knockdown in WI 38 cells reduces spreading and fibronectin assembly, and the effect is partially complemented by coating recombinant Alix on the cell substratum. Immortalized NIH/ 3 T 3 fibroblasts deposit less Alix on the substratum and have defects in α 5 β 1 -integrin functions. Coating recombinant Alix on the <b>culture</b> <b>substratum</b> for NIH/ 3 T 3 cells promotes α 5 β 1 -integrin-mediated cell adhesions and fibronectin assembly, and these effects require the aa 605 – 709 region of Alix. These findings demonstrate that a sub-population of Alix localizes extracellularly and regulates integrin-mediated cell adhesions and fibronectin matrix assembly...|$|R
40|$|Echinoderm Mutable Collagenous Tissues (MCTs) undergo nervously mediated, drastic and {{reversible}} {{changes in}} their passive mechanical properties. MCT mutability is involved in autotomy,posture maintenance and motility, and, as a consequence, it influences all aspects of echinoderm biology (nutrition, reproduction, habitat selection, self-defense and predatory behavior) representing a key-factor for the ecological success of the phylum. Besides this, MCT performance represents a topic of remarkable interest for many different applied fields. A biomimetic research route looks at MCTs {{as a source of}} inspiration for the development of smart and innovative biomaterials with great potential for in vitro and in vivo applications when controlled and reversible plasticization and/or stiffening of the extracellular matrix is required. The MIMESIS (Marine Invertebrates Models & Engineered Substrates for Innovative bio-Scaffolds) project has been developed within this scientific context. The selected echinoderm model is the common sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. This project is based on a multidisciplinary approach combining functional biology with biomaterial engineering. A brief review of recent morphological, biomolecular, biomechanical and biochemical results on P. lividus MCTs are here presented in a biotechnological perspective, taking into account also a promising application regarding the use of MCT-derived <b>substrata</b> for cell <b>culture</b> studies...|$|R
