5|$|Justus was {{a member}} of the Gregorian mission sent to England by Pope GregoryI. Almost {{everything}} known about Justus and his career is derived from the early 8th-century Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum of Bede. As Bede does not describe Justus' origins, nothing is known about him prior to his arrival in England. He probably arrived in England with the <b>second</b> <b>group</b> of missionaries, sent at the request of Augustine of Canterbury in 601. Some modern writers describe Justus as one of the original missionaries who arrived with Augustine in 597, but Bede believed that Justus came in the <b>second</b> <b>group.</b> The <b>second</b> <b>group</b> included Mellitus, who later became Bishop of London and Archbishop of Canterbury.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine which is {{important}} for motor skill learning, shot interval or trial number. Participants were 36 novice students in the university. Task was free throwing shot in the basketball. Participants were divided into three groups; 3 seconds, 6 seconds, and 9 <b>seconds</b> <b>groups.</b> Participants of 3 <b>seconds</b> <b>group</b> threw 102 trials in 3 seconds interval in a set. Participants of 6 <b>seconds</b> <b>group</b> threw 51 trials in 6 seconds interval. And participants of 9 <b>seconds</b> <b>group</b> threw 34 trials in 9 seconds interval. 20 trials pretest was employed in free shot intervals before the first day in acquisition trials. An acquisition trials session were composed of three days. Participants performed two sets of 306 seconds trial set each day. Participants also performed 20 trials posttest in free shot intervals each day. 20 trials retention test was employed in free shot intervals 24 hours later of the last day in acquisition trials. In the pretest there were no differences between groups. In the acquisition trials session all three groups improved their performance although there were no differences between groups. In the posttest in 2 nd day 6 <b>seconds</b> <b>group</b> was significantly better than 3 seconds and 9 <b>seconds</b> <b>groups.</b> However, in the retention test and other posttests there were no significant differences between groups. Although the results were not clear, it seemed that motor skill learning on a free throw shot task in basketball were affected by not only trial number but also trial interval. More studies need to be employed for this topic...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} the plasma arc curing (PAC) unit for composite curing. To compare its effectiveness with conventional quartz tungsten halogen (QTH) light curing units, the microhardness of two composites (Z 100 and Tetric Ceram) that had been light cured by the PAC or QTH units, were compared according to the depth from the composite surface. In addition, linear polymerization shrinkage was compared using a custom-made linometer between composites which were light cured by PAC or QTH units. Measuring polymerization shrinkage for two resin composites (Z 100 and Tetric Ceram) was performed after polymerization with either QTH or PAC units. In the case of curing with the PAC unit, the composite was light cured with Apollo 95 E for two (Group 1), three (Group 2), six (Group 3) or 2 x 6 (<b>Group</b> 4) <b>seconds.</b> For light curing with the QTH unit, the composite was light cured for 60 seconds with Optilux 500 (Group 5). The linear polymerization shrinkage of composites was determined in the linometer. Two resin composites were used to measure microhardness. Two-mm thick samples were light cured for three <b>seconds</b> (<b>Group</b> 1), six <b>seconds</b> (<b>Group</b> 2) or 12 (2 x 6) <b>seconds</b> (<b>Group</b> 3) with Apollo 95 E or they were conventionally light cured with Optilux 500 for 30 <b>seconds</b> (<b>Group</b> 4) or 60 <b>seconds</b> (<b>Group</b> 5). For 3 mm thick samples, the composites were light cured for six <b>seconds</b> (<b>Group</b> 1), 12 (2 x 6) <b>seconds</b> (<b>Group</b> 2) or 18 (3 x 6) <b>seconds</b> (<b>Group</b> 3) with Apollo 95 E or they were conventionally light cured with Optilux 500 for 30 <b>seconds</b> (<b>Group</b> 4) or 60 <b>seconds</b> (<b>Group</b> 5). Twenty samples were assigned to each group. The microhardness of the upper and lower surfaces was measured with a Vickers hardness-measuring instrument under load. The difference in microhardness between the upper and lower surfaces in each group was analyzed by paired t-test. For the upper or lower surfaces, one-way ANOVA with Tukey was used. For Tetric Ceram, the amount of polymerization shrinkage was lower when cured with the Apollo 95 E for two or three seconds than when cured for six and 12 (2 x 6) seconds, or for 60 seconds with Optilux 500 (p< 0. 05). For Z 100, the amount of linear polymerization shrinkage was lower when cured with the Apollo 95 E for two, three and six seconds than for 12 (2 x 6) seconds with Apollo 95 E or for 60 seconds with the Optilux 500 (p< 0. 05). The results of the microhardness test indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in microhardness between groups for the upper surface. However, for the lower surface, when the composites were light cured with Apollo 95 E for three seconds as recommended by the manufacturer, microhardness of the lower surface was usually lower than that of the upper surface and did not cure sufficiently. Conclusively, when compared with conventional QTH unit, the PAC unit, Apollo 95 E did not properly cure the lower composite surface when the layer thickness exceeded 2 mm. In addition, three seconds of curing time, which the manufacturer recommended, was insufficient for optimal curing of composites...|$|R

40|$|Background: A burn is {{the most}} common injury occured in the world and it is a type of trauma which have high {{morbidity}} and mortality. A high incidence of burns become a challenge to the investigators, forensic experts, and law enforcement officers to distinguish wether the burns occured before death, around the time of death, or after death. Aim: to know the difference of intravital, perimortem and postmortem histopathological changes of lower respiratory tract in Balb/c mice with fire exposure. Methods: This study was an experimental study with Post Test-Only Control Group Design. Samples were 49 Balb/c mice that devided into 7 groups. Group K was a control (without fire exposure). Group P 1 was given intravital fire exposure for 10 <b>seconds.</b> <b>Group</b> P 2 was given intravital fire exposure for 20 <b>seconds.</b> <b>Group</b> P 3 was given perimortal fire exposure for 10 <b>seconds.</b> <b>Group</b> P 4 was given perimortal fire exposure for 20 <b>seconds.</b> <b>Group</b> P 5 was given postmortal fire exposure for 10 <b>seconds.</b> <b>Group</b> P 6 was given perimortal fire exposure for 20 seconds. After the intervension, the lungs were taken for microscopic. The data was analysed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney test. Results: Kruskal-Wallis test showed significant difference of all groups in vascular dilatation parameter (p bronchial= 0, 022; p bronchioles= 0, 010; p alveolar= 0, 000) and inflammatory cells parameter (p bronchial= 0, 005; p bronchioles= 0, 024; p alveolar= 0, 002). In soot parameter, there was significant different of bronchial and alveolar group (p bronchial= 0, 005; p alveolar= 0, 002), but in bronchioles group showed no significant difference (p bronchioles= 0, 709). Conclusions: There was significant difference of bronchial, bronchioles, and alveolar group in vascular dilatation and inflammatory cells parameter. In soot parameter, significant difference was showed in bronchial and alveolar group, but not in bronchiolus group.
