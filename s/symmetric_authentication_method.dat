40|$|Abstract—The {{mandatory}} {{and most}} deployed <b>authentication</b> <b>method</b> {{used in the}} Session Initiaton Protocol, the Digest Access <b>Authentication</b> <b>method,</b> is weak. Other, more secure authentica-tion methods have emerged, but have seen little adoption yet. In this paper, support for using a generic <b>authentication</b> <b>method,</b> the Generic Security Services API, {{is added to the}} Session Initiaton Protocol. When using this method, the Session Initation Protocol does not need to support nor implement other <b>authentication</b> <b>methods,</b> only use the provided API library. This enables the Session Initiation Protocol to transparently support and use more secure <b>authentication</b> <b>methods</b> in a unified and generic way. As the suggested method includes a modification of the Session Initiation Protocol, an initial deployment strategy towards the Generic Security Services API <b>authentication</b> <b>methods</b> is added.

40|$|Abstract Tool-supported proofs of {{security}} protocols typically rely on abstractions from real cryptography by term algebras, so-called Dolev-Yao models. However, until recently {{it was not}} known whether a Dolev-Yao model can be implemented with real cryptography in a provably secure way under active attacks. For public-key encryption and signatures, this was recently shown, if one accepts a few additions to a typical Dolev-Yao model such as an operation that returns {{the length of a}} term. Here we extend this Dolev-Yao-style model, its realization, and the security proof to include a first <b>symmetric</b> primitive, message <b>authentication.</b> This adds a major complication: we must deal with the exchange of secret keys. For <b>symmetric</b> <b>authentication,</b> we can allow this at any time, before or after the keys are first used for authentication, while working only with standard cryptographic assumptions.

40|$|IEEE 802. 1 X is a {{key part}} of IEEE 802. 11 i. By {{employing}} EAP it supports a variety of upper layer <b>authentication</b> <b>methods</b> each with different benefits and drawbacks. Any one of these <b>authentication</b> <b>methods</b> can be the ideal choice for a specific networking environment. The fact that IEEE 802. 11 i leaves the selection of the most suitable <b>authentication</b> <b>method</b> to system implementers makes the authentication framework more flexible {{but on the other hand}} leads to the question of how to select the <b>authentication</b> <b>method</b> that suits an organisation’s requirements and specific networking environment.

40|$|There {{is a lot}} of {{internet}} shopping done nowadays. People are buying goods from electronic shops and paying for them in online payment systems. These systems need to provide secure user <b>authentication</b> <b>method</b> for user to log in and to pay for the goods. The main purpose of this work is to create and investigate new online payment system with better user <b>authentication</b> <b>method.</b> This method is based on user’s electronic signature. In this work there were investigated the most popular online payment systems to find out which <b>authentication</b> <b>method</b> they are using to authenticate user. All of those systems provide password based user authentication which we found to be not secure enough because there are some ways for third party to find out users passwords. There were also investigated most popular user <b>authentication</b> <b>methods</b> to find out their advantages and disadvantages. After implementation of new online payment system’s user <b>authentication</b> <b>method</b> there was done investigation of this method. There were done some researches to find out this <b>authentication</b> <b>method</b> advantages and disadvantages. It was found that this method is more secure because it uses PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) which ensures integrity and authenticity. New <b>authentication</b> <b>method</b> was compared with existing <b>authentication</b> <b>method</b> used in real online payment systems and found that it takes twice longer time for user to be authenticated than it is done in existing online payment systems. But it takes only about 100 ms to be authenticated which user won’t feel. Also new <b>authentication</b> <b>method</b> may be difficult for user to use so before using it in real life he needs to be trained.

This research study developed a benchmarking instrument intended to assess <b>authentication</b> <b>methods</b> used in Web-based information systems (IS). It developed an <b>Authentication</b> <b>Method</b> System Index (AMSI) to analyze collected data from representative samples of e-learning systems in the U. S. and from healthcare ISs, also in the U. S. This data were used to compare <b>authentication</b> <b>methods</b> used by those systems. The AMSI measured 1) password strength requirements, 2) password usage methods, and 3) password reset requirements. Those measures were combined into the single index that represents the current <b>authentication</b> <b>methods.</b> This study revealed {{that there is no}} significant difference in the ways that <b>authentication</b> <b>methods</b> are employed between the two groups of ISs. This research validated the criteria proposed for the AMSI using a panel of experts drawn from industry and academia. Simultaneously, the same panel provided preferences for the relative weight of specific criteria within some measures. The panel of experts also assessed the relative weight of each measure within the AMSI. Once the criteria were verified and the elicited weights were computed, an opportunity sample of Web-based ISs in the two groups identified earlier were assessed to ascertain the values for the criteria that comprise the AMSI. After completion of pre-analysis data screening, the collected data were assessed using the results of the AMSI benchmarking tool. Results of the comparison within and between the two sample groups are presented. This research found that the AMSI can be used as a mechanism to measure some aspects of the <b>authentication</b> <b>methods</b> used by Web-based systems. There was no measurable significance in the differences between the samples groups. However, IS designers, quality assurance teams, and information security practitioners charged with validating ISs methods may choose to use it to measure the effectiveness of such <b>authentication</b> <b>methods.</b> This can enable continuous improvement of <b>authentication</b> <b>methods</b> employed in such Web-based systems...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{challenges}} involved in authentication over wireless networks including wireless LANs, IEEE 802. 11, and WIMAX, IEEE 802. 16 are described. Both IEEE 802. 11 i and 802. 16 e support EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) for authentication, {{but do not}} specify the EAP <b>method</b> required for <b>authentication.</b> This paper examines four different categories of EAP methods: legacy methods such as EAP-MD 5 and CHAP, certificate-based <b>authentication</b> <b>methods</b> such as EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, and PEAP; password-based <b>authentication</b> <b>methods,</b> such as EAP-LEAP and EAP-FAST; and strong password-based <b>authentication</b> <b>methods</b> such as EAP-SPEKE. The EAP methods are examined {{with respect to their}} vulnerabilities as well as their convenience of utilization. The legacy methods do not meet the criteria established by RFC 4017 to be used for wireless communication. The conclusion is that although certificate-based <b>authentication</b> <b>methods</b> such as EAP-TLS which is specifically mentioned in 802. 16 e have the strongest security, these methods are not very convenient to use. Password-based <b>authentication</b> <b>methods,</b> on the other hand, are very convenient to use, but provide the least amount of security.
