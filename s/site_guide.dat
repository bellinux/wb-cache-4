40|$|Many viruses use a {{powerful}} terminase motor to pump their genome inside an empty procapsid shell during virus maturation. The large terminase (TerL) protein contains both enzymatic activities necessary for packaging in such viruses: the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) that powers DNA translocation and an endonuclease that cleaves the concatemeric genome at both initiation and completion of genome packaging. However, how TerL binds DNA during translocation and cleavage remains mysterious. Here we investigate DNA binding and cleavage using TerL from the thermophilic phage P 74 - 26. We report {{the structure of}} the P 74 - 26 TerL nuclease domain, which allows us to model DNA binding in the nuclease active site. We screened a large panel of TerL variants for defects in binding and DNA cleavage, revealing that the ATPase domain is the primary site for DNA binding, and is required for nuclease activity. The nuclease domain is dispensable for DNA binding but residues lining the active <b>site</b> <b>guide</b> DNA for cleavage. Kinetic analysis of DNA cleavage suggests flexible tethering of the nuclease domains during DNA cleavage. We propose that interactions with the procapsid during DNA translocation conformationally restrict the nuclease domain, inhibiting cleavage; TerL release from the capsid upon completion of packaging unlocks the nuclease domains to cleave DNA...|$|E

40|$|Braamfontein, Johannesburg {{is being}} {{significantly}} overhauled. The community can soon reclaim the Egoli Gasworks, where that site will be declared as a brown field site seeking development opportunity and integration with its adjacent surroundings.

The culturally significant industrial heritage of the site serves as {{starting point for the}} decision-making. Facilities and communities in direct adjacency to the <b>site</b> <b>guide</b> decision making regarding the function of new edifices in the precinct. The assessed surrounding characters solicited functions geared for a media and film orientated precinct. The Gauteng Film Office, in conjunction with Gauteng premier Mbhazima Shilowa and the MEC for finance and economic affairs, Jabu Moleketi, recently hosted a two-day film indaba at the Johannesburg council chambers in Braamfontein aimed at exploring avenues for making the film industry lucrative to both local and international filmmakers. The indaba addressed the challenges facing Gauteng and South Africaâ€™s film industry, such as encouraging and promoting local filmmakers and actors, upgrading the skills of filmmakers, and marketing South African films so they appeal to an international audience. (Johannesburg News Agency: www. joburg. org. za;) A film centre, comprising of a museum and cinema is the chosen function for the design dissertation. The centre serves as a medium to draw people into the precinct and as a middling to communicate to the public. Both the museum and cinema serve as mediums to promote the South-African film industry locally and internationally. Consequently, the treatise design is a binary response to the influences posed by the cultural significant site of urban-industrial character, and that of an ever-changing world of digital film and video technologies. The investigation for the new architecture for the Film Centre explores the territories of film in the digital age, and its relevance in the making of place. Assessed existing patterns in the architectural landscape form the base of the design regarding form, scale and visual appropriateness. Dissertation (MArch (Prof)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{strategy}} is to identify the Fiscal Year (FY) 2001 Hanford Site waste reduction, sanitary recycling and affirmative procurement goals and identify the action required {{to ensure that the}} Secretary of Energy's FY 2005 pollution prevention and the FY 2001 Hanford Site goals are met. The strategy and plan to ensure that the Secretary of Energy's routine waste reduction, recycling, cleanup/stabilization waste and affirmative procurement goals are met consists of four phases. The first phase is to ensure that the infrastructure is in place to support planning and organization. This phase involves ensuring that roles and responsibilities are identified; requirement documents are current; goals and successes are communicated; and accurate and current waste information is available. Roles and responsibilities are identified and the RL requirement documents (i. e., the Hanford Site Waste Minimization and Pollution Prevention Awareness Program Plan and Hanford <b>Site</b> <b>Guide</b> for Preparing and Maintaining Generator Group Pollution Prevention Program Documentation) will specify the Secretary of Energy's goals. Goals will be communicated formally and informally via the Hanford Reach, training sessions, meetings and correspondence. Sharing of pollution prevention successes and goal progress are encouraged at the Pollution Prevention/Waste Minimization (PZ/WMin) quarterly meetings. Existing site waste generation databases will be utilized to provide current waste generation data. The second phase of the strategy and plan is to establish and allocate goals by prime contractor (i. e. Fluor Hanford, Inc. (FH), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Bechtel Hanford Inc. (BHI), and CH 2 MHill Hanford Group (CHG)). This requires determining current status toward meeting the Secretary of Energy's goals; establishing the Hanford Site FY goals, and allocating waste reduction goals by prime contractor. The third phase of the strategy and plan is goal implementation. This phase involves the identification and implementation of corrective actions for problem areas identified either during the development of the Hanford Site goals or during monthly monitoring of the goals. Areas of concern identified during the development of the goals were the Mixed Low Level Waste (MLLW), Hazardous, and cleanup waste goal. The fourth phase of the strategy and plan is measuring results. This phase consists of: Measuring Results; Development of performance measures; and Reporting progress quarterly. The performance measures have been developed for the tracking of the waste reduction, sanitary recycling, affirmative procurement, and toxic chemical release goals. The first quarter performance measures tracking the recommended goals will be issued by January 3 I, 2001...|$|E
