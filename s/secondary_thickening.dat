40|$|The rice {{bacterial}} blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae is a vascular pathogen that elicits {{a defensive}} response through interaction with metabolically active rice cells. In leaves of 12 -day-old rice seedlings, the exposed pit membrane separating the xylem lumen from the associated parenchyma cells allows contact with bacterial cells. During resistant responses, the xylem <b>secondary</b> walls <b>thicken</b> within 48 h and the pit diameter decreases, effectively reducing {{the area of}} pit membrane exposed for access by bacteria. In susceptible interactions and mock-inoculated controls, the xylem walls do not thicken within 48 h. Xylem <b>secondary</b> wall <b>thickening</b> is developmental and, in untreated 65 -day-old rice plants, {{the size of the}} pit also is reduced. Activity and accumulation of a secreted cationic peroxidase, PO-C 1, were previously shown to increase in xylem vessel walls and lumen. Peptide-specific antibodies and immunogold-labeling were used to demonstrate that PO-C 1 is produced in the xylem parenchyma and secreted to the xylem lumen and walls. The timing of the accumulation is consistent with vessel <b>secondary</b> wall <b>thickening.</b> The PO-C 1 gene is distinct but shares a high level of similarity with previously cloned pathogen-induced peroxidases in rice. PO-C 1 gene expression was induced as early as 12 h during resistant interactions and peaked between 18 and 24 h after inoculation. Expression during susceptible interactions was lower than that observed in resistant interactions and was undetectable after infiltration with water, after mechanical wounding, or in mature leaves. These data are consistent with a role for vessel <b>secondary</b> wall <b>thickening</b> and peroxidase PO-C 1 accumulation in the defense response in rice to X. oryzae pv. oryzae...|$|R

40|$|In plants, {{secondary}} wall thickenings play {{important roles}} in various biological processes, although the factors regulating these processes remain to be characterized. We show that expression of chimeric repressors derived from NAC SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR 1 (NST 1) and NST 2 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in an anther dehiscence defect due to loss of <b>secondary</b> wall <b>thickening</b> in anther endothecium. Plants with double, but not single, T-DNA–tagged lines for NST 1 and NST 2 had the same anther-indehiscent phenotype as transgenic plants that expressed the individual chimeric repressors, indicating that NST 1 and NST 2 are redundant in regulating <b>secondary</b> wall <b>thickening</b> in anther walls. The activity of the NST 2 promoter was particularly strong in anther tissue, while that of the NST 1 promoter was detected in various tissues in which lignified secondary walls develop. Ectopic expression of NST 1 or NST 2 induced ectopic <b>thickening</b> of <b>secondary</b> walls in various aboveground tissues. Epidermal cells with ectopic <b>thickening</b> of <b>secondary</b> walls had structural features {{similar to those of}} tracheary elements.

The number of cells produced by cambium, cell radial diameters in the cell growth expansion zone and the thickness/wall tracheid cross-sectional area in the <b>secondary</b> wall <b>thickening</b> zone were estimated at the transverse sections of samples taken from the stems in 10 days. The data obtained were used for the calculation of the development durations of tracheids in the zones of differentiation and the dependence of these characteristics of the processes on air temperature.

The development of <b>secondary</b> wall <b>thickening</b> of earlywood cells occurred in June-July, latewood ones – in August to the first half of September. Hydrothermal conditions of these months affect considerably the morphological parameters of the tracheids.

40|$|SECONDARY WALL-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN 1 (SND 1) is {{a master}} {{transcriptional}} switch activating the developmental program of secondary wall biosynthesis. Here, we demonstrate that a battery of SND 1 -regulated transcription factors is required for normal secondary wall biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. The expression of 11 SND 1 -regulated transcription factors, namely, SND 2, SND 3, MYB 103, MYB 85, MYB 52, MYB 54, MYB 69, MYB 42, MYB 43, MYB 20, and KNAT 7 (a Knotted 1 -like homeodomain protein), was developmentally associated with cells undergoing <b>secondary</b> wall <b>thickening.</b> Of these, dominant repression of SND 2, SND 3, MYB 103, MYB 85, MYB 52, MYB 54, and KNAT 7 significantly reduced <b>secondary</b> wall <b>thickening</b> in fiber cells. Overexpression of SND 2, SND 3, and MYB 103 increased <b>secondary</b> wall <b>thickening</b> in fibers, and overexpression of MYB 85 led to ectopic deposition of lignin in epidermal and cortical cells in stems. Furthermore, SND 2, SND 3, MYB 103, MYB 85, MYB 52, and MYB 54 were able to induce secondary wall biosynthetic genes. Direct target analysis using the estrogen-inducible system revealed that MYB 46, SND 3, MYB 103, and KNAT 7 were direct targets of SND 1 and also of its close homologs, NST 1, NST 2, and vessel-specific VND 6 and VND 7. Together, these results demonstrate that a transcriptional network consisting of SND 1 and its downstream targets is involved in regulating secondary wall biosynthesis in fibers and that NST 1, NST 2, VND 6, and VND 7 are functional homologs of SND 1 that regulate the same downstream targets in different cell types...|$|R

In this study, we established a system to induce the differentiation of tracheary elements using a transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cell suspension stably expressing a green fluorescent protein-tubulin fusion protein. Approximately 30 % of the cells differentiated into tracheary elements 96 h after culture in auxin-free media containing 1 μm brassinolide.

We have profiled the methanol-soluble oligolignol fraction of poplar (Populus spp.) xylem, a tissue with extensive lignification. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, chemical synthesis, and nuclear magnetic resonance, we have elucidated the structures of 38 compounds, most of which were dimers, trimers, and tetramers derived from coniferyl alcohol, sinapyl alcohol, their aldehyde analogs, or vanillin. All structures support the recently challenged random chemical coupling hypothesis for lignin polymerization. Importantly, the structures of two oligomers, each containing a γ-p-hydroxybenzoylated syringyl unit, strongly suggest that sinapyl p-hydroxybenzoate is an authentic precursor for lignin polymerization in poplar...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] In {{the stage}} of {{elongation}} growth of cotton fiber, there is a plenty of amoeboid plas-tids, lipid droplets and rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (RER) in the cytoplasm. On the other hand, in {{the stage of}} <b>secondary</b> wall <b>thickening,</b> cytoplasm is poor in amoeboid plastids and lipid droplets, but rich in smooth- and rough-surfaced ER. The fact that microtubules alter their orientation from perpendicular to parallel to the cell axis {{in the course of}} transition from primary to. secondary wall deposition suggests that microtubules are responsible for the orientation of microfibril. Through secondary wall growth, vesicle-secreting ability of Golgi bodies seems to be very poor. In view of almost all cellulose that composes the cell wall components of cotton fiber, Golgi-derived vesicles could not excrete cellulose precursor to the wall. It was found that smooth-surfaced ER (SER) is derived from RER during the <b>secondary</b> wall <b>thickening.</b> In addition, vesicles (larger than Golgi-derived vesicles) and cisternae of SER appear most frequently near the plasmalemma and seems to be incorporated into the cell wall. Consequent-ly, a close correlation between SER and wall synthesis is presumed in the development of cotton fiber.
