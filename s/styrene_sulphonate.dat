40|$|To our knowledge, {{the present}} study is the first attempt to {{evaluate}} the effect of different process parameters on the amount of polyelectrolyte adsorbed on a cotton textile substrate via sequential adsorption of negatively charged poly (<b>styrene</b> <b>sulphonate)</b> (PSS) and positively charged poly (allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) using layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly nanocoating process. A considerably different polymer adsorption behaviour was observed from thick adsorbed layers to thin adsorbed layer with different degree of layer penetration and ionic pair formation over the pH range (2. 5 - 9. 0) studied. The amount of polyelectrolyte adsorption on cotton fabric was evaluated by measuring the colour value (K/S) of methylene blue absorbed cotton surface. Contact angle measurement revealed that the extent of binding of the oppositely charged polyions on the fabric depends on the pH of the polyelectrolyte solution and 'zipped-up' structure with more ion pair formation was observed at the pH range 4. 5 - 6. 5. At higher temperature, the amount of polyelectrolyte adsorbed within the multilayers was higher. An increased deposition of PSS and PAH was observed with increase in electrolyte (NaCl) concentration. The amount of PSS and PAH adsorption increased up to 0. 03 (M) of PSS and 0. 01 (M) of PAH concentrations, respectively. A dipping time of 5 min was sufficient to have a maximum deposition of the polyelectrolyte multilayers...|$|E
40|$|Near-infrared diffuse {{tomography}} {{was used}} in order to observe dynamic behaviour of flowing gases by measuring the 3 D distributions of composition and temperature in a weakly scattering packed bed reactor, subject to wall effects and non-isothermal conditions. The technique {{was applied to the}} vapour phase hydrogen isotopic exchange reaction in a hydrophobic packing of low aspect ratio made of platinum on <b>styrene</b> divinyl benzene <b>sulphonate</b> copolymer resin. The results of tomography revealed uneven temperature and composition maps of water and deuterated water vapours in the core-packed bed and {{in the vicinity of the}} wall owing to flow maldistribution. The dynamic lag between the near-wall water vapour and deuterated water vapour compositions were observed suggesting that the convective transfer which was significant near the wall at the start, owing to high porosity, was also effective at large conversions.

40|$|The {{improvement}} of the mechanical properties of emulsified styrene butadiene rubber ion exchange membrane through blending with 60 nm carbon nanoballs is reported in this work. Homogeneous blending was achieved using a 200 W Probe Ultrasonicator at 60 % amplitude to produce a 160 μm thick nanocomposite ion exchange membrane. Weight concentrations varying from 0. 25 to 4 wt%CNB {{were added to the}} <b>sulphonated</b> <b>styrene</b> butadiene rubber in solution and cast by the evaporative technique. Mechanical testing was done using Hysitron Nanotensile 5000 Tester to evaluate the effects of blending. Tensile strength, σs, increased linearly (2 - 3. 88 MPa) with carbon nanoball volume fraction (Vf), achieving a maximum {{improvement of}} 94 % at 14. 2 % Vf. The Young’s modulus, E increased as a power function of Vf, reaching a maximum of 79 % (1 agglomeration. The fracture toughness, Uf. t increased as a power function of Vf up to a maximum improvement of 215 % (0. 84 – 2. 65 MPa) at 14. 2 % Vf. Strain, e increased by a maximum of 63 % (0. 68 – 1. 11) at 14. 2 % Vf. Higher ultrasonication amplitudes achieved superior dispersion effectiveness as compared to lower amplitudes. The nanofiller addition also significantly reduced degradation of mechanical properties with time. Below a critical nanofiller volume fraction, Vc, related to the fractional free volume of the polymer matrix, the E profile was consistent with existing models by Guth and Thomas. However, the coefficients of Vf, were significantly higher, which was attributed to the higher mechanical properties of carbon nanoballs as compared to the fillers assumed. Beyond Vc, agglomeration distorted the profile. The tensile strength profile for the well dispersed carbon nanoballs was different from the existing models by Nicolais and Narkis and Nielsen. It was concluded that the addition of [1 - 14 vol% (1 - 4 wt%) ] carbon nanoballs improved the mechanical properties by a margin between 79 % and 369 %. With good dispersion, it can also be shown that prediction of mechanical properties for a given Vf was possible. Further work on dispersion improvement was shown to have the potential to increase the mechanical properties by up to 700 %...|$|R
