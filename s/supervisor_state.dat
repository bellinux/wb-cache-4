50|$|IBM {{mainframes}} in the System/360 and successor families {{operate in}} one of two states: problem state or <b>supervisor</b> <b>state.</b> In problem state, a large set of general purpose non-privileged instructions are available to a user program. In <b>supervisor</b> <b>state,</b> system programs are additionally able to use a small set of privileged instructions which are generally intended for supervisory functions. These functions may affect other users, other processors, or the entire computer system. A program is only allowed to access specific supervisory functions after thorough authorization checking by the operating system: DEBCHK (SVC 117), TESTAUTH (SVC 119), and possibly additional tests. Programs which fail any of these tests are ABENDed, that is abnormally terminated and immediately cease processing. Some of these tests were not available in OS/360, but were added in SVS or MVS/370, but all were available in MVS/370 or subsequent releases, and are still available to this day.|$|E
50|$|The new {{instructions}} {{included some}} minor improvements and extensions to the <b>supervisor</b> <b>state,</b> several instructions for software management of a multiprocessing system (which were removed in the 68060), {{some support for}} high-level languages which did not get used much (and was removed from future 680x0 processors), bigger multiply (32×32→64 bits) and divide (64÷32→32 bits quotient and 32 bits remainder) instructions, and bit field manipulations.|$|E

50|$|The first hypervisors {{providing}} full virtualization {{were the}} test tool SIMMON and IBM's one-off research CP-40 system, which began production use in January 1967, {{and became the}} first version of IBM's CP/CMS operating system. CP-40 ran on a S/360-40 that was modified at the IBM Cambridge Scientific Center to support Dynamic Address Translation, a key feature that allowed virtualization. Prior to this time, computer hardware had only been virtualized enough to allow multiple user applications to run concurrently (see CTSS and IBM M44/44X). With CP-40, the hardware's <b>supervisor</b> <b>state</b> was virtualized as well, allowing multiple operating systems to run concurrently in separate virtual machine contexts.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning with MVS/370, IBM {{considered}} it a product defect if a system design error would allow an application program to enter <b>supervisor</b> <b>state</b> without authorization. They mandated that all IBM SVCs be protected to close all system- and data-integrity exposures. They [...] "guaranteed" [...] to close such exposures as these were discovered. By Release 3.7 of MVS/370 in 1977 nearly every such exposure had indeed been identified and closed, {{at the cost of}} 100,000 Authorized Program Analysis Reports (APARs) and related Program temporary fixes (PTFs). This was a remarkable achievement, as system [...] "up time" [...] was thereafter measured in years, rather than in days or even in hours.|$|E
5000|$|Simulation {{is the use}} of a {{monitoring}} program to interpret the machine code instructions of some computer architectures. Such an instruction set simulator can provide memory protection by using a segmentation-like scheme and validating the target address and length of each instruction in real time before actually executing them. The simulator must calculate the target address and length and compare this against a list of valid address ranges that it holds concerning the thread's environment, such as any dynamic memory blocks acquired since the thread's inception, plus any valid shared static memory slots. The meaning of [...] "valid" [...] may change throughout the thread's life depending upon context. It may sometimes be allowed to alter a static block of storage, and sometimes not, depending upon the current mode of execution, {{which may or may not}} depend on a storage key or <b>supervisor</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In MVS/370 and {{subsequent}} {{versions of the}} OS, the MODESET function (SVC 107) obviated the need for many user-written SVCs as this system SVC accommodated both change in mode (problem state to <b>supervisor</b> <b>state)</b> and changes in key (non-zero user [...] to zero system [...] ) in a single operation, and many user-written SVCs were originally intended for simple mode and key changes, anyway, {{and subsequent}}ly the only requirement was that the MODESET-invoking program be resident in a [...] "link library" [...] which was identified as an [...] "authorized library", and this secure approach was completely under the installation's control. This link library could be the system's own link library, SYS1.LINKLIB, or a user's link library which was associated with SYS1.LINKLIB. This change generally simplified user controls over authorization, although some simple changes to the application were thereby required. In general, user installations favored this accommodation, and the overall reliability of the system was significantly improved thereby.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, {{three years}} after Mills left his post as <b>supervisor,</b> <b>state</b> Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued the town in federal court, accusing the police {{department}} of petty corruption, civil liberties violations, and harassment. The town entered into {{an agreement with the}} state, dismissed the police chief, agreed to the appointment of an overseer and accepted a lengthy code of conduct laid out by the state. The police chief, James Coscette, had been appointed by Mills and unanimously confirmed by the Town Board. [...] Did we collect specific evidence that this was going on when Howard Mills was supervisor? No, but we didn't need to go that far back. However, having done a lot of these investigations, the kinds of problems that we saw are not the kinds of problems that spring up overnight. They are the kinds of problems that fester for years and years, and so I would be very surprised if these problems had not been going on for many years, back through several administrations, including his.

50|$|The {{parts of}} the OS {{critical}} to its correct operation execute in kernel mode, while other software (such as generic system software) and all application programs execute in user mode. This fundamental distinction is usually the irrefutable distinction between the operating system and other system software. The {{part of the system}} executing in kernel <b>supervisor</b> <b>state</b> is called the kernel, or nucleus, of the operating system. The kernel operates as trusted software, meaning that when it was designed and implemented, it was intended to implement protection mechanisms that could not be covertly changed through the actions of untrusted software executing in user space. Extensions to the OS execute in user mode, so the OS does not rely on the correctness of those {{parts of the}} system software for correct operation of the OS. Hence, a fundamental design decision for any function to be incorporated into the OS is whether it needs to be implemented in the kernel. If it is implemented in the kernel, it will execute in kernel (supervisor) space, and have access {{to other parts of the}} kernel. It will also be trusted software by the other parts of the kernel. If the function is implemented to execute in user mode, it will have no access to kernel data structures. However, the advantage is that it will normally require very limited effort to invoke the function. While kernel-implemented functions may be easy to implement, the trap mechanism and authentication at the time of the call are usually relatively expensive. The kernel code runs fast, but there is a large performance overhead in the actual call. This is a subtle, but important point.|$|E
50|$|Several {{national}} Home Visiting Programs {{have developed}} and attained standards for successful training and home visiting cases for home visitors {{as well as}} for the program <b>supervisors.</b> <b>States</b> and local programs may use these models to establish a program but some local programs also may customize and tailor their programs according to their local needs by utilizing local resources and institutions. Local programs may follow some of elements from the national programs and integrate them, which create varieties of practice models, depending on the needs and availability of the local communities. The local models may not have evidence of consistent outcomes.|$|R
