6000|$|... "Aha! such a gay young <b>sea-cock</b> {{does not}} come hither for naught. Drink first, man, and tell us thy {{business}} after," [...] and he reached the horn to Hereward.|$|E
6000|$|And so did {{pass the}} brave bit of {{feathered}} {{life with the}} heart of pluck, called of men, and of himself, [...] "Cocky," [...] who had been birthed in the jungle roof of the island of Santo, in the New Hebrides, who had been netted by a two-legged black man-eater and sold for six sticks of tobacco and a shingle hatchet to a Scotch trader dying of malaria, and in turn had been traded from hand to hand, for four shillings to a blackbirder, for a turtle-shell comb made by an English coal-passer after an old Spanish design, for the appraised value of six shillings and sixpence in a poker game in the firemen's forecastle, for a second-hand accordion worth at least twenty shillings, and on for eighteen shillings cash to a little old withered Chinaman--so did pass Cocky, as mortal or as immortal as any brave sparkle {{of life on the}} planet, from the possession of one, Ah Moy, a <b>sea-cock</b> who, forty years before, had slain his young wife in Macao for cause and fled away to sea, to Kwaque, a leprous Black Papuan who was slave to one, Dag Daughtry, himself a servant of other men to whom he humbly admitted [...] "Yes, sir," [...] and [...] "No, sir," [...] and [...] "Thank you, sir." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Houbraken he {{was both}} a cook and a painter, known by the bentname [...] "Zeehaan" [...] (Sea-rooster, or <b>Sea-cock)</b> for going to Rome twice by sea. He lived in Dordrecht [...] "by de Groothoofdspoort, over 't Ossenhoofd".|$|E
60|$|So the ch√¢telain of St. Omer, {{with all}} his knights and men-at-arms, and Hereward with his <b>sea-cocks,</b> marched {{northwest}} up to Guisnes, with little Arnulf cantering alongside in high glee; for {{it was the first}} war that he had ever seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cheerly, my <b>sea-cocks</b> [...] Crow for the day-dawn. [...] Weary and wet are we, [...] Water beladen. [...] Wetter our comrades, [...] Whelmed by the witch-whale. [...] Us Aegir granted [...] Grudging, to Gondul, [...] Doomed to die dry-shod, [...] Daring the foe." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hereward {{knew well}} the {{exploits}} of Robert le Frison in Spain and Greece. [...] "I trust that your noble uncle," [...] he asked, [...] "is well? He was one of us poor <b>sea-cocks,</b> and sailed the swan's path gallantly, till he became a mighty prince. Here is a man here who was with your noble uncle in Byzant." ...|$|R
5000|$|Petard {{left the}} area for Haifa, {{signalling}} that documents had been captured. The codebooks they retrieved were immensely valuable to the Ultra code-breakers at Bletchley Park in England; just six weeks after the action, many U-boat signals were being read. An Admiralty report on the sinking stated [...] "The battle was largely won by persistence". The German engineer officer said that prior to abandoning ship he had opened the <b>sea-cocks</b> on the U-boat. Thornton, honouring a promise he had made to the shipyard, sent them a German U-boat seaman's lifejacket as a trophy.|$|R
25|$|As firefighters {{on shore}} and in fire boats poured {{water on the}} blaze, the ship {{developed}} a dangerous list to port due to water pumped into the seaward side by fireboats. The ship's designer Vladimir Yourkevitch arrived at the scene to offer expertise, but he was barred by harbor police. His suggestion was to enter the vessel and open the <b>sea-cocks.</b> This would flood the lower decks and make her settle the few feet to the bottom. With the ship stabilised, water could be pumped into burning areas without the risk of capsize. The suggestion {{was rejected by the}} commander of the 3rd Naval District, Rear Admiral Adolphus Andrews.|$|R
50|$|The islands cluster {{round the}} huge deep-water {{anchorage}} of Scapa Flow like a protecting hand, {{and in both}} World War I and World War II, the Royal Navy had a major base there, enabling them to challenge any attempt by German warships to emerge into the ocean through the Norwegian Sea. After the Armistice in 1918, the German High Seas Fleet was transferred in its entirety to Scapa Flow while a decision was {{to be made on}} its future; however, the German sailors opened their <b>sea-cocks</b> and scuttled all the ships. Most ships were salvaged, but the remaining wrecks are now a favoured haunt of recreational divers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aha!" [...] said Hereward {{without looking}} round. [...] "I never {{thought there would}} be loose stones in the roof. Here! Up here, Vikings, Berserker, and <b>sea-cocks</b> all! Here, Jutlanders, Jomsburgers, Letts, Finns, witches' sons and devils' sons all! Here!" [...] cried he, while Osbiorn profited by that moment to thrust an {{especially}} brilliant jewel into his boot. [...] "Here is gold, here is the dwarfs work! Come up and take your Polotaswarf! You would not get a richer out of the Kaiser's treasury. Here, wolves and ravens, eat gold, drink gold, roll in gold, and know that Hereward is a man of his word, and pays his soldiers' wages royally!" ...|$|R
5|$|Orkney was {{the site}} of a navy base at Scapa Flow, which {{played a major role in}} World War I. After the Armistice in 1918, the German High Seas Fleet was {{transferred}} in its entirety to Scapa Flow while a decision was to be made on its future; however, the German sailors opened their <b>sea-cocks</b> and scuttled all the ships. During World War I the 10th Cruiser Squadron was stationed at Swarbacks Minn in Shetland and during a single year from March 1917 more than 4,500 ships sailed from Lerwick as part of an escorted convoy system. In total, Shetland lost more than 500 men, a higher proportion than any other part of Britain, and there were waves of emigration in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|R
5|$|Orkney was {{the site}} of a Royal Navy base at Scapa Flow, which {{played a major role in}} World War I and II. After the Armistice in 1918, the German High Seas Fleet was {{transferred}} in its entirety to Scapa Flow to await a decision on its future. The German sailors opened the <b>sea-cocks</b> and scuttled all the ships. Most ships were salvaged, but the remaining wrecks are now a favoured haunt of recreational divers. One month into World War II, a German U-boat sank the Royal Navy battleship HMS Royal Oak in Scapa Flow. As a result, barriers were built to close most of the access channels; these had the additional advantage of creating causeways enabling travellers to go from island to island by road instead of being obliged to rely on ferries. The causeways were constructed by Italian prisoners of war, who also constructed the ornate Italian Chapel.|$|R
6000|$|Bradley replied. [...] "You see the result, sir," [...] he said. [...] "It {{might have}} been a very {{different}} result but for Miss La Rue. We were all asleep. Benson had relieved the guard early in the evening; {{there was no one to}} watch him--no one but Miss La Rue. She felt the submergence of the boat and came out of her room to investigate. She was just in time to see Benson at the diving rudders. When he saw her, he raised his pistol and fired point-blank at her, but he missed and she fired--and didn't miss. The two shots awakened everyone, and as our men were armed, the result was inevitable as you see it; but it would have been very different had it not been for Miss La Rue. It was she who closed the diving-tank <b>sea-cocks</b> and roused Olson and me, and had the pumps started to empty them." ...|$|R
6000|$|Daughtry {{shook his}} head. He had early {{learned that it}} was wise to get along well with sea-cooks, since <b>sea-cocks</b> were {{notoriously}} given to going suddenly lunatic and slicing and hacking up their shipmates with butcher knives and meat cleavers on the slightest remembered provocation. Besides, there was an equally good bunk {{all the way across}} the width of the steerage from the Chinaman's. The bunk next on the port side to the cook's and abaft of it Daughtry allotted to Kwaque. Thus he retained for himself and Michael the entire starboard side with its three bunks. The next one abaft of his own he named [...] "Killeny Boy's," [...] and called on Kwaque and the cook to take notice. Daughtry had a sense that the cook, whose name had been quickly volunteered as Ah Moy, was not entirely satisfied with the arrangement; but it affected him no more than a momentary curiosity about a Chinaman who drew the line at a dog taking a bunk in the same apartment with him.|$|R
