5|$|Hygeberht had {{resigned}} his <b>see</b> <b>before</b> Lichfield was demoted {{back to a}} bishopric. He was still named as archbishop in 799, but evidence suggests {{that he no longer}} controlled all of the suffragan bishops that he once had. Possibly, he was replaced at Lichfield; his successor Ealdwulf attended a council in 801, and was named bishop in the council's records. By the time that Æthelhard held another council at Clovesho in 803, Hygeberht was no longer even named as a bishop, and appears at that council as an abbot. Which abbey he was abbot of, and his exact date of death, are unknown.|$|E
5|$|In March 1994, Jurassic Park won {{all three}} Academy Awards {{for which it}} was nominated: Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects (at the same ceremony, Spielberg, editor Michael Kahn, and {{composer}} John Williams won Academy Awards for Schindler's List). The film won honors outside the U.S. including the 1994 BAFTA for Best Special Effects, as well as the Award for the Public's Favorite Film. It won the 1994 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, and the 1993 Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Direction, Best Writing for Crichton and Koepp and Best Special Effects. The film won the 1993 People's Choice Awards for Favorite All-Around Motion Picture. Young Artist Awards were given to Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello, with the film winning an Outstanding Action/Adventure Family Motion Picture award. In 2001, the American Film Institute ranked Jurassic Park as the 35th most thrilling film of American cinema. The film has been included in the book 1001 Movies You Must <b>See</b> <b>Before</b> You Die, film lists by Empire magazine, and The Guardian.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{falls into}} the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; {{the souls of the}} Underworld weaken him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is confronted by the spirit of Athena, who had {{previously}} sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos. She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she now sees truths she did not <b>see</b> <b>before.</b> She states that as long as Zeus reigns, there is no hope for mankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that to kill Zeus, he must quench the Flame of Olympus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest. After encountering the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hades, which releases the souls of the Underworld. When he considers searching for the soul of Calliope, Athena reminds Kratos of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld, arriving at Olympia. There he finds the wounded Gaia, who calls for help. He severs her arm, causing her to fall from Mount Olympus to her apparent death.|$|E

5|$|Warelwast went {{blind in}} his later years, {{starting}} in about 1120, which William of Malmesbury regarded as a fitting punishment for Warelwast's alleged attempts to remove his predecessor from office early. He died about 26 September 1137, and {{was buried in the}} priory at Plympton. He may have resigned his see prior to his death. The 16th-century antiquary John Leland thought that Warelwast resigned his <b>see</b> <b>before</b> 1127, became a canon at Plympton, and died in 1127. Although Leland's year of death is incorrect, it is possible that Warelwast became a canon shortly before his death. The Annales Plymptonienses records that Robert of Bath, the Bishop of Bath, gave Warelwast his last rites on 26 September 1137, and records that the dying bishop was made a member of the collegiate church at Plympton. Warelwast's nephew Robert Warelwast succeeded as Bishop at Exeter in 1138; Robert had been appointed archdeacon of Exeter by his uncle.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the early}} diocesan {{succession}} of Argyll is uncertain, the jurisdiction itself {{appears to have}} lain outwith the domain of Rǫgnvaldr's direct control, allowing the meic Somairle to readily act as religious patrons without his interference. Like the Kingdom of the Isles itself, the great geographic size of the Diocese of the Isles appears to {{have contributed to the}} alienation of outlying areas, and to its eventual disintegration. In fact, there is reason to suspect that portions of the new diocese were likewise detached from the Scottish dioceses of Dunblane, Dunkeld, and Moray. Although the Scottish Crown may have welcomed the formation of the new diocese, as it may have formed part of a plan to project Scottish royal authority into the region, the meic Somairle rulers of the region were in fact hostile to the Scots, and the diocese's seat on Lismorealbeit first recorded in the early fourteenth centurylay far outwith the Scottish king's sphere of influence. Whatever the case, the foundation of the Diocese of Argyll {{appears to have been a}} drawn-out and gradual process that was unlikely to have been the work of one particular mansuch as Somerled, Dubgall, or Ragnall himself. Although the early diocese suffered from prolonged vacancies, as only two bishops are recorded to have occupied the <b>see</b> <b>before</b> the turn of the mid thirteenth century, over time it became firmly established in the region, allowing the meic Somairle to retain local control of ecclesiastical power and prestige.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{begins with}} Evac {{moving out of}} the loading station and making a turn. The vehicle {{approaches}} the first of thirteen 3D high-definition video screens which depicts Ravage grabbing a canister containing the AllSpark. Evac spins 180° to face the second screen on which Bumblebee is fighting Sideways for the AllSpark, which ends up in Evac's possession. Evac reverses into one of two elevator shafts which ascend to the second level of the attraction. During the ascent Optimus Prime battles Megatron and Grindor chases Evac who is furiously heading in reverse until Grindor's arm is broken off by a train. Megatron grabs Evac and the two struggle until Megatron breaks a water pipe, which sprays riders with water. Evac enters a dead end pathway before reversing and turning to face another 3D screen, which shows Megatron firing a missile at Evac while continuing to find Optimus. Hot air and fog generate the illusion of an explosion. Evac then heads through the hole in a building which was caused by the explosion. Inside lies Devastator, who is trying to suck everything out of the building. Ratchet and Ironhide cover fire while Evac reverses and escapes the suction. Here the Autobot Sideswipe helps in the battle against the Decepticon Bonecrusher. Devastator returns to the scene alongside Starscream. Evac escapes from Devastator a second time by going through him, but Starscream grabs Evac and throws him across several city blocks before landing on a construction site and smashing into some drums which release clouds of fog resulting in Evac asking if the riders are okay. Optimus Prime and Megatron continue their battle in the construction site as Evac reverses away in an attempt to protect the AllSpark. Starscream appears for a second time but is chased away by two NEST helicopters. Evac then returns to a second set of two elevators. During the descent to the ground floor, Evac forces the AllSpark into Megatron's chest causing both to freefall to the ground when Megatron grabs Evac. Bumblebee saves Evac from destruction before Optimus Prime congratulates Evac and the riders on their mission. The last thing guests <b>see</b> <b>before</b> disembarking is the twisted wreckage of Megatron stuck in the ceiling near the exit.|$|E

25|$|Dell {{had long}} stuck by its direct sales model, {{which was now}} cited as a {{disadvantage}} compared to rivals such as HP and Acer that also sold computers via retail stores. The lack of a retail presence stymied Dell's attempts to offer certain electronics items that customers wanted to <b>see</b> <b>before</b> buying. In early 2007, the company moved away from its direct-only sales model and experimented with mall kiosks and quasi-retail stores in Texas and New York.|$|E

25|$|Staying in Palestine until August 1945, Koestler {{collected}} {{material for}} his next novel, Thieves in the Night. When he returned to England Mamaine Paget, whom he had started to <b>see</b> <b>before</b> going out to Palestine, was waiting for him. In 1945 August the couple moved to the cottage of Bwlch Ocyn, a secluded farmhouse that belonged to Clough Williams-Ellis, in the Vale of Ffestiniog. Over {{the next three years}} Koestler would become a close friend of George Orwell. The region had its own intellectual circle, which would have been sympathetic to Koestler: Williams-Ellis' wife, Amabel, a niece of Lytton Strachey was also a former communist; other associates included Rupert Crawshay-Williams, Michael Polanyi, Storm Jameson and, most significantly, Bertrand Russell, who lived {{just a few miles from}} the Koestler cottage.|$|E
