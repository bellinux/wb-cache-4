60|$|Three of his brave men, {{apparently}} Abishai, Benaiah, and Eleazar, {{heard the}} wish. Between their mountain fastness and the dearly loved spring lay {{the host of}} the Philistines; but their love for their leader feared no enemies. It was not only water that he longed for, but the water from the fountain which he had loved in his childhood. They descended from their chasm, broke through the midst of the enemy's army, and drew the water from the favorite <b>spring,</b> <b>bearing</b> it back, once again through the foe, to the tower upon the rock! Deeply moved was their chief at this act of self-devotion--so much moved that the water seemed to him to be too sacred to be put to his own use. 'May God forbid it me that I should do this thing. Shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy, for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it?' And as a hallowed and precious gift, he poured out unto the Lord the water obtained at the price of such peril to his followers.|$|E
60|$|XXIX. One more {{principle}} of Proportion I have to name, equally simple, equally neglected. Proportion is between three terms at least. Hence, as the pinnacles {{are not enough}} without the spire, so neither the spire without the pinnacles. All men feel this and usually express their feeling {{by saying that the}} pinnacles conceal the junction of the spire and tower. This is one reason; but a more influential one is, that the pinnacles furnish the third term to the spire and tower. So that it is not enough, in order to secure proportion, to divide a building unequally; it must be divided into at least three parts; it may be into more (and in details with advantage), but on a large scale I find three is about the best number of parts in elevation, and five in horizontal extent, with freedom of increase to five in the one case and seven in the other; but not to more without confusion (in architecture, that is to say; for in organic structure the numbers cannot be limited). I purpose, in the course of works which are in preparation, to give copious illustrations of this subject, but I will take at present only one instance of vertical proportion, from the flower stem of the common water plantain, Alisma Plantago. Fig. 5, Plate XII. is a reduced profile of one side of a plant gathered at random; it is seen to have five masts, of which, however, the uppermost is a mere shoot, and we can consider only their relations up to the fourth. Their lengths are measured on the line A B, which is the actual length of the lowest mass a b, A C=b c, A D=c d, and A E=d e. If the reader will take the trouble to measure these lengths and compare them, he will find that, within half a line, the uppermost A E=5/7 of A D, A D=6/8 of A C, and A C=7/9 of A B; a most subtle diminishing proportion. From each of the joints spring three major and three minor branches, each between each; but the major branches, at any joint, are placed over the minor branches at the joint below, by the curious arrangement of the joint itself--the stem is bluntly triangular; fig. 6 shows the section of any joint. The outer darkened triangle is the section of the lower stem; the inner, left light, of the upper stem; and the three main branches spring from the ledges left by the recession. Thus the stems diminish in diameter just as they diminish in height. The main branches (falsely placed in the profile over each other to show their relations) have respectively seven, six, five, four, and three arm-bones, like the masts of the stem; these divisions being proportioned in the same subtle manner. From the joints of these, {{it seems to be the}} plan of the plant that three major and three minor branches should again <b>spring,</b> <b>bearing</b> the flowers: but, in these infinitely complicated members, vegetative nature admits much variety; in the plant from which these measures were taken the full complement appeared only at one of the secondary joints.|$|E

40|$|A {{joint effort}} between the Connecticut Department of Transportation and the University of Connecticut has been {{underway}} {{for more than}} 20 years to use different monitoring approaches {{in the assessment of}} the state 2 ̆ 7 s bridge infrastructure. This thesis is based on study of a three span curved post-tensioned concrete box-girder bridge with expansion bearings. It is part of a monitoring network and has been successfully monitored over a 6 year time period. Establishment of a baseline is essential for continuous monitoring of such a complicated bridge. Operationally, the baseline of structural health monitoring relates to the establishing of field testing database and finite element (FE) model which forms the basis for assessing the structural integrity. The establishment of the baseline field database to eliminate the effect of varying temperature conditions on the field testing data was first studied. This database used data collected from a full year cycle and was based on the undamaged status. Next, a new Mindlin plate element with an embedded through crack was developed for modeling cracking conditions on the bridge in FE analysis. The element behavior was investigated using numerical examples. Finally, the baseline FE model of the bridge was developed after updating to reflect the current condition. This involved the calibration of the material properties, utilization of <b>spring</b> <b>bearing</b> elements, and replacement of Mindlin plate elements (MP 4) on box-girder with cracked Mindlin plate elements (MP 4 C) to represent the bridge operating conditions. A good agreement in modal results has been observed between the baseline FE model and the baseline field database. Following this, the baseline FE model was used with an earthquake simulation based on introducing a selected ground motion to the bridge. It is shown that the field database and FE model established in this study can be reliably used as a baseline of the bridge monitoring system. The results demonstrate that a baseline study is necessary in order to assess the structural integrity for the bridge over time. ...|$|E

40|$|Virtually all {{previous}} research on the squeeze-film damping of rotor assemblies has considered the use of only one damper. However, many aero-engine rotor assemblies {{have at least two}} dampers and the interplay between them {{is an important factor in}} the overall vibration performance of the rotor.

Non-linear jump phenomena and subharmonic resonances are demonstrated both experimentally and theoretically for a range of rotor unbalance.
