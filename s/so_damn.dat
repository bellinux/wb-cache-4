500|$|Although the {{critical}} reaction varied, by November 2005, the album had achieved platinum {{status in the}} US. Entertainment Weekly described the release as [...] "hilarious", and [...] "no mere comedy record". AllMusic wrote that the album [...] "rocks <b>so</b> <b>damn</b> hard", but lamented the absence {{of some of the}} songs from the television show. Flak Magazine criticised the band's use of skits between songs, describing them as [...] "distracting" [...] and a [...] "nuisance". In addition, The Independent remarked that the album was full of [...] "swearing and scatology" [...] and was [...] "bereft of even the slightest skidmark of humour".|$|E
500|$|Baby Gerald, Luigi Risotto, Assistant Superintendent Leopold, and Flanders' parents {{make their}} first {{appearances}} {{on the show}} in this episode. Leopold and Luigi were designed by David Silverman, one of the show's directors. Anderson thought Luigi {{was one of the}} funniest characters on the show when he first read Luigi's lines in the script during a table read of the episode. When Anderson skimmed through the script and saw Luigi's lines, he said he [...] "frightened Julie Kavner because I was laughing to myself, but trying to keep the laughter in because it was <b>so</b> <b>damn</b> funny." ...|$|E

500|$|Bomer {{received}} plaudits {{from most}} reviewers. Crystal Bell of the Huffington Post called his appearance [...] "perfect casting" [...] and Bomer {{as one of}} her favorite guest stars. Strecker and VanDerWerff praised the [...] "hilariously bad acting advice" [...] in Cooper's master class, and VanDerWerff said that the storyline of Blaine being [...] "overshadowed by his charismatic older brother" [...] worked [...] "because the actors were <b>so</b> <b>damn</b> committed to it". Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson was not fond of Cooper's appearance, and described it as [...] "an old-school sitcom cliche to introduce long-lost or oft-neglected family members". Dodge noted that Bomer's role [...] "didn't overshadow everyone else, like some guest stars do".|$|E
500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A, {{calling it a}} [...] "classic" [...] and writing that it [...] "is <b>so</b> <b>damn</b> clever in how it bonds Jerry's fears about social niceties with larger fears about mortality"; he also praised Louis-Dreyfus's acting, saying that Elaine [...] "has an amusingly stark little bit of {{dialogue}} about death midway through the episode: [...] "You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that!" [...] I think it's probably Louis-Dreyfus' best moment of the show so far, because she's really starting to nail Elaine's declarative, vaguely imperious, self-centered tone." [...] He also admired [...] "the estimable Barney Martin in his first appearance as Jerry's irascible dad." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the track}} {{is about a}} girl who is tired of being {{manipulated}} by people around her and doesn't {{need to be told}} what to do, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You're gonna have to see through my perspective/ I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am/ And I don't want to be <b>so</b> <b>damn</b> protected". Dana Alice Heller, author of Makeover television: realities remodelled (2007), said that, with [...] "Overprotected", [...] "Spears addresses the problem of being a teen star whose personal and professional are handled by others." [...] She also compared [...] "Overprotected" [...] with the singer's first reality show, [...] (2005), saying that [...] "Britney frames her makeover as a move toward to independence, a rebellion against overly controlling parents and their stand-ins." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] is {{different}} from Knowles' previous dance-pop songs as it makes use of a retro style. It is an upbeat track that draws from the genre of R. The song also contains elements of up-tempo disco and funk music. It consists of energetic tribal beats, a drum loop, funky guitars and a bassline {{that was designed to}} make it a groovy and dance song. According to the lyrics of [...] "Why Don't You Love Me", Knowles impersonates a woman who questions her love interest about the reason for which he does not value her fabulousness, convincing him she's the best thing for him as she sings: [...] "Why don't you love me... when I make me <b>so</b> <b>damn</b> easy to love?... I got beauty... I got class... I got style and I got ass...". The singer further tells her love interest that the decision not to choose her is [...] "entirely foolish".|$|E
500|$|... "Thirsty" [...] is a [...] "club-friendly" [...] R {{song with}} an {{influence}} of hip hop music, which lasts for a duration of three minutes and 26 seconds. [...] "Thirsty" [...] {{is about how}} Carey's lover has a thirst for fame which causes her to drown in her own misery. Billy Johnson, Jr. for Yahoo! Music described the track as [...] " [...] those desperate for attention." [...] The singer is [...] "taking center stage as she takes aim at a starfucker" [...] as she performs her [...] "nonchalant" [...] verses over a [...] "skittering" [...] minimal synth beat. The songs begins {{with the sound of}} a drink being poured into a glass, after which the instrumental begins to play and Carey sings line [...] "You used to be Mr. All About Me, now you're just thirsty for celebrity" [...] in her upper register, then continues to ask her suitor [...] "Why you try <b>so</b> <b>damn</b> hard?" [...] During the chorus, Carey repeatedly sings the hook [...] "Uh, you're Thirs-tay/ Uh, you're Thirs-tay".|$|E
500|$|... "Bionic" [...] is an {{electronic}} song and lasts for a duration of [...] (three minutes and twenty-one seconds). It features [...] "twitchy space-ace" [...] rhythms, rapping verses {{and talks about}} an [...] "echo-laden" [...] invitation to [...] "jet off to the new millennium". In {{the middle of the}} song, Aguilera spells out her name, [...] "X-x-x-t-t-t-i-i-i-n-n-n-n-n-a". During the chorus, she sings, [...] "Bionic, <b>so</b> <b>damn</b> Bionic, gonna get you with my electronic supersonic rocket, ay". Becky Bain of Idolator wrote that [...] "This track showcases more of the adventurous new directions Christina said she hoped to try on this album. We like it!" [...] She further compared [...] "Bionic" [...] to works by Santigold. Michael Cragg from MusicOMH wrote that the song [...] "sounds just like a Santigold track, which is no bad thing". PopMatters critic Omar Kholeif simply described the track as [...] "a thumping" [...] number, while Melinda Newman of HitFix deemed it [...] "a futuristic song, with interesting beats". Newman also compared [...] "Bionic" [...] to Janet Jackson's [...] "Rhythm Nation", [...] "but not nearly as captivating". A reviewer from Daily Star described the song as [...] "a raunchy, dub-flecked treat, reminiscent of Rihanna and Santigold".|$|E

500|$|Cleveland {{reached the}} {{championship}} game in the following three seasons but lost each time, once to the Rams and twice to the Detroit Lions. Gillom led the NFL in punting in 1951, with a 45.5-yard average. He again led the league the following season, averaging 45.7 yards per punt, and was selected for the Pro Bowl, football's all-star game. Gillom was second in the NFL in punting average in 1953. During his years with the Browns, Gillom's long, high punts and his habit of standing further back from center than was usual set a precedent followed by many of his successors at the position. His kicks had a long hang time, which allowed teammates to get further downfield to defend the punt return. [...] "We didn't just go back 40 yards, we went back 50, 60 yards because he just kicked it <b>so</b> <b>damn</b> far and so high", Otto Schnellbacher, who played against the Browns with the Yankees and Giants, later said. Gillom's positioning behind the center gave him more space to kick but also put more distance {{between him and the}} opposing linemen, reducing the likelihood of a block.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{presents}} Eli as an androgynous boy, castrated {{centuries before}} by a sadistic vampire nobleman. The film handles {{the issue of}} Eli's gender more ambiguously: a brief scene in which Eli changes into a dress offers {{a glimpse of a}} suggestive scar but no explicit elaboration. When Oskar asks Eli to become his girlfriend, Eli tries to tell Oskar [...] "I'm not a girl". An actress plays Eli's character, but her voice was considered to be too high pitched, so it was dubbed by voice actress Elif Ceylan. According to an interview with the director, as the film was originally conceived, flashbacks explained this aspect in more detail, but these scenes were eventually cut. In the end, Ajvide Lindqvist was satisfied with the adaptation. When Alfredson showed him eight minutes of footage for the first time, he [...] "started to cry because it was <b>so</b> <b>damn</b> beautiful". He subsequently described the film as a [...] "masterpiece". [...] "It doesn't really matter that [...] didn't want to do it the way I wanted it in every respect. He could obviously never do that. The film is his creative process", he said.|$|E
500|$|In the NME, Tony Tyler {{began his}} review {{by stating that}} he had long idolised Harrison as [...] "the finest {{packaged}} object since frozen pizza", but he had changed his opinion dramatically in recent years; after the [...] "dire, ennui-making" [...] All Things Must Pass, Tyler continued, [...] "the unworthiness of my heretical thoughts smote home {{around the time of}} the Bangla Desh concerts." [...] Tyler dismissed Material World with the description: [...] " [...] pleasant, competent, vaguely dull and inoffensive. It’s also breathtakingly unoriginal and – lyrically at least – turgid, repetitive and <b>so</b> <b>damn</b> holy I could scream." [...] The reviewer concluded: [...] "I have no doubt whatever it'll sell like hot tracts and that George'll donate all the profits to starving Bengalis and make me feel like the cynical heel I undoubtedly am." [...] In their 1975 book , Tyler and co-author Roy Carr bemoaned Harrison's [...] "didactically imposing [...] said Holy Memoirs upon innocent record-collectors" [...] and declared the album's spiritual theme [...] "almost as offensive in its own way" [...] as Lennon and Yoko Ono's political radicalism on Some Time in New York City (1972).|$|E

In 2013, Complex ranked Cloud as the eighth greatest soldier in video games.|$|E
500|$|The season's finale Death And All His Friends {{was highly}} praised. Marsi gave the episode five stars, and {{expressed}} {{that it may}} have been the best episode of the series, adding: [...] "The writing and acting were absolutely stellar, and may lead to many Emmy nominations, but even more impressively, despite a killing spree, it remained distinctly Grey's. Some of the back-and-forths between the characters were truly memorable, and some of the developments so heartbreaking that we don't even know where to begin now. Seriously, the Season 6 finale left us laying awake afterward thinking about everything, a feeling we haven't had from Grey's in years and rarely achieved by any program." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV also noted that the finale was the best episode, adding: [...] " [...] two of the best hours of television all year. It was certainly the best Grey's Anatomy has ever been, which is saying a lot since I'd written the show off for the past few years. No show does a big traumatic event like Grey's Anatomy, and the shooter gave the show license for heightened drama with five major characters being shot over the two hours. It was emotional, expertly paced and had me in tears for most of the finale." [...] Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "At any rate, now you can at least see where it all began. And while you’re still pondering how Grey's can still be <b>so</b> <b>damn</b> good sometimes," ...|$|E
500|$|Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote, [...] "Beyoncé may {{not know}} a thing about algebra, {{but when it comes to}} the math of power ballads, she totally gets it." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "the album [...] opens with its most tender ballad, a slow-burning number that calls back to both Sam Cooke's 'Wonderful World' and Prince's 'Purple Rain' without {{sounding}} like a retread of either tune [...] it sounds best in the context of the album, where its slow, steady build to a cathartic guitar break is the perfect introduction to a set of mostly low-key tracks about love and heartbreak." [...] Similarly considering [...] "1+1" [...] to be [...] "the perfect opener" [...] of 4, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK wrote that it exposes a more vulnerable side of Beyoncé and that it will remain [...] "a classic stripped-back slow jam from the diva." [...] Praising Beyoncé's vocals, Jon Caramainca of The New York Times stated that [...] " [...] requires a vocal muscle few singers possess, and even fewer would care to deploy." [...] Writing for The Baltimore Sun, Wesley Case included [...] "1+1" [...] in his list of Five Great Songs and praised song's concept, writing that he began crying when he heard the album version and called it [...] "gut-wrenching" [...] and [...] "gorgeous". Case appreciated Beyoncé's sensitivity and concluded that it [...] "fades to black like an ellipsis and it's <b>so</b> <b>damn</b> beautiful." ...|$|E

500|$|The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow praised Scott's performance, {{as well as}} how {{the writers}} have [...] "smartly underplayed" [...] the {{relationship}} between Leslie and Ben. Meslow also liked that the April-Andy subplot was now resolved, as he called it the [...] "weakest plotline of the season", but he felt the scenes between Chris and Ann in [...] "Media Blitz" [...] were a rehash of the previous episode. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic praised Scott's performance, calling him a master at the straight man role, but said he was funnier the previous week in [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two": [...] "The laughs weren't as loud on [...] "Media Blitz," [...] as {{it was more of a}} squirm-inducing half hour of television." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN called it a fine episode that was [...] "dominated, in a good way, by its softer, sweeter moments", particularly the kiss between Andy and April, which he said [...] "was <b>so</b> <b>damn</b> sweet that I just couldn't resist it". Although he enjoyed the Perd Hapley interview, Fowler said he did not find Scott's performance otherwise especially funny. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis also praised Scott's performance, adding, [...] "Did anyone else's heart melt just a little bit at the proud smile that crept across Leslie’s face when Ben found his voice?" [...] Busis also said she was glad the April and Andy reconciled, as April's constant mistreatment of Andy was making it harder and harder to like her character. Busis criticized the Ann and Chris subplot, of which she said, [...] "Wake me up when something actually happens." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga and anime have {{commented on}} Hiruma's character. Chris Beveridge from Mania.com stated that [...] "the outlandish nature of Hiruma with his guns blazing gets old very quickly" [...] and {{considered it a}} [...] "downside" [...] to the series. On the other hand, Ain't It Cool News' Scott Green said that [...] "impish Hiruma starts out as a unique star." [...] Mania.com's Jarred Pine noted that Hiruma is [...] "so completely over-the-top and out of left field that I couldn't help laughing" [...] and that his [...] "rude, crude, and completely unpredictable" [...] behavior [...] "makes his character <b>so</b> <b>damn</b> enjoyable". Pine concluded that Hiruma's personality was [...] "instantly memorable" [...] and his [...] "unpredictable nature" [...] was responsible for making the story [...] "so enjoyable". The contrast with [...] "Sena's hard effort and Hiruma's trickery and devilish nature" [...] was also praised by Pine. Writing for Anime News Network (ANN), Carlo Santos praised Hiruma's character design as [...] "imaginative" [...] with his [...] "lanky" [...] and [...] "demon-like appearance" [...] and additionally commented that [...] "despite his sheer ruthlessness, it's hard not to laugh as Hiruma enthusiastically resorts to blackmail in recruiting students for the team". Erin Finnegan of ANN also noted the [...] "demonic-looking" [...] aspect of Hiruma, saying he is [...] "like a predecessor of Ozu from The Tatami Galaxy with a love of football". ANN's Zac Bertschy called Hiruma the [...] "most fun" [...] character insofar, making note of his [...] "brash, menacing and ultimately passionate" [...] personality and that [...] "in a sense, Hiruma turns the 'kindly old coach-come-mentor who helps the hero along' cliché on its ear". Chris Homer of The Fandom Post considered Hiruma [...] "the most memorable part of the show", saying he is [...] "everyone's favourite and most memorable character". Partly because of his [...] "sheer insanity", demonstrated by his recruiting methods, {{and partly because of}} the fact he gradually shows care and trusts for the team Homer wrote that [...] "he is an instantly memorable character" [...] and [...] "so unique in this show (and any show for that matter)".|$|E
