5|$|Holden's {{standardisation}} of six airbags in March 2008 for MY09 {{made the}} VE {{eligible for the}} ANCAP side pole test, yielding additional scoring points. The second stage of the VE's safety rollout in October 2008 for MY09.5 included {{the addition of a}}n energy absorbing steering column shroud and redesigned rear door latches across the VE range. The inclusion of a <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> reminder on the Omega sedan yielded another point, thus allowing the Omega sedan to score five-stars, or a score of 33.45 when tested the following December. The Omega Sportwagon was the next model to be awarded the full five stars the following February, following the addition of a <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> reminder in Sportwagon production. The remaining VE models, including the Ute and WM Statesman/Caprice, which had already received most of the safety upgrades, received the <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> reminder as standard fitment as of MY10 production from August 2009. As a result, all VE sedan and Sportwagon variants along with the extended length WM models received the five-star rating. The VE Ute officially received the rating on 19 October 2009, making the entire line-up of Australian-made Holdens five-star ANCAP rated.|$|E

5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was a short distance away from his seat and both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they had been thrown after the nose of the aircraft was split open in the impact with a large tree. The <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face from the heat of the nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> to drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E

5000|$|Automatic <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> {{received}} {{a boost in}} the United States in 1977 when Brock Adams, United States Secretary of Transportation in the Carter Administration, mandated that by 1983 every new car should have either airbags or automatic <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> despite strong lobbying from the auto industry. Adams was attacked by Ralph Nader, {{who said that the}} 1983 deadline was too late. Soon after, General Motors began offering automatic <b>seat</b> <b>belts,</b> first on the Chevrolet Chevette, but by early 1979 the VW Rabbit and the Chevette were the only cars to offer the safety feature, and GM was reporting disappointing sales. By early 1978, Volkswagen had reported 90,000 Rabbits sold with automatic <b>seat</b> <b>belts.</b> A study released in 1978 by the United States Department of Transportation claimed that cars with automatic <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> had a fatality rate of [...]78 per 100 million miles, compared with 2.34 for cars with regular, manual belts.|$|R

5|$|Among Jones' other accomplishments {{were the}} passage of a {{mandatory}} <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> law, an increase in funding for the state park system, and the phasing out of the state inheritance tax. He also established the state's largest-ever reserve trust fund using income from the state's sales, income, corporate, coal, severance, and property taxes. He exceeded his goal of having a 7.4percent minority representation in the state workforce, and appointed three times more African-Americans than the previous administration had recruited. He also appointed more women to government positions than his predecessor, including Sara Combs, the first woman to serve on the Kentucky Supreme Court.|$|E

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{the use of}} <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> for front <b>seat</b> {{passengers}} {{was made}} compulsory in 1975, and on April 1 st 1992 the use of rear <b>seat</b> <b>belts,</b> if fitted, became a legal requirement. Since 1968, an annual survey of the presence and use of <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> on front <b>seats</b> - extended in 1989 to include rear seats - has been conducted in the Netherlands. An evaluation of compliance with the law stipulating the use of rear <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> was conducted by comparing the observation and surveys carried out in October 1992 and 1991. A significant rise {{in the use of}} rear <b>seat</b> <b>belts,</b> when fitted, was found: from 15 to 31 % in built-up areas and from 12 to 37 % on rural roads. For front <b>seat</b> <b>belts,</b> a small increase was found on town roads, from 62 % to 66 %, while on rural roads the percentage was around 80 % in both years. It was calculated that the use of front and rear <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> has a great growth potential. It is recommended that information campaigns should promote 'social persuasion', with emphasis on the increased risk of injury sustained by a non-belted occupant and the risk of having a proportion of the damage compensation withheld by the insurance company. In addition, the non-user can inflict injury on other belted occupants, and can therefore be sued for damages either by the victims or by their insurance company. Intensive police enforcement combined with public information sustained over several weeks, followed by a period of enforcement at a lower level of intensity can lead to an increased use of <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> through habituation...|$|R
40|$|This notice {{from the}} Department of Transportation, denies a {{petition}} for rule-making filed by Physicians for Automotive Safety (PAS), asking this agency to mandate {{the installation of}} <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> on all school buses. NHTSA believes that the currently mandated occupant protections in school buses provide an adequate level of safety protection, and that <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> would not {{raise the level of}} protection for the occupants unless States and local jurisdictions were willing to take steps to ensure that the <b>seat</b> <b>belts</b> were actually used...|$|R
5|$|Mean Streak {{operated}} {{with three}} trains manufactured by Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters (PTC) that were colored red, gold, and green.

5|$|Non-use of {{seat belts}} is a {{significant}} risk factor. According to Col. Tom Butler, chief of the Montana Highway Patrol, preliminary 2015 data indicated that 178 of the 224 vehicle occupant fatalities were of individuals not wearing seat belts. The fine in Montana for not wearing a <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> in 2015 was $20. Although speed limits increased from 75mph to 80mph on rural interstates that year, the biggest statewide increase in both crashes and deaths occurred on secondary roads. Forty-three people died on Montana two-lane roads outside of towns that are neither U.S. or state highways.|$|E
5|$|Reconstruction {{projects}} in the later parts of the 20th century have caused local protests by entities such as the town of Hempstead and the village of Westbury. The latter was concerned about construction affecting {{the way of life}} in Westbury, and the mayor and citizens wanted confirmation that the reconstruction of Northern State Parkway exit31â€”the Meadowbrook State Parkway's northern terminusâ€”would not lead to environmental disruption. In August 1998, the Meadowbrook was dedicated as the Senator Norman J. Levy Memorial Parkway in honor of Norman J. Levy, a state senator who helped sponsor the first <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> law in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Since a {{major cause}} of TBI are vehicle accidents, their {{prevention}} or the amelioration of their consequences can both reduce the incidence and gravity of TBI. In accidents, damage can be reduced by use of seat belts, child safety seats and motorcycle helmets, and presence of roll bars and airbags. Education programs exist to lower the number of crashes. In addition, changes to public policy and safety laws can be made; these include speed limits, <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> and helmet laws, and road engineering practices.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{election}} as lieutenant governor, Patton resigned his office as Pike County judge-executive. While {{presiding over the}} Senate in the 1991 legislative session, Patton voted against a mandatory <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> law, breaking a 19â€“19 tie. He was the last Kentucky lieutenant governor to preside over the Kentucky Senate; a 1992 amendment to the state constitution created a new position, President of the Kentucky Senate, and relieved the lieutenant governor of his duties in that body.|$|E

5|$|Swift died, aged 44, in the Munich air {{disaster}} after {{reporting on}} Manchester United's European Cup match against Red Star Belgrade in Belgrade, Yugoslavia for the News of the World. On 6 February 1958, the {{flight back to}} Manchester carrying the Manchester United team and journalists made a refuelling stop at Munich-Riem Airport in poor weather. Two take-off attempts were abandoned due to engine problems, with the weather continuing to deteriorate. On the third attempt, slush on the runway prevented the aircraft from reaching the required speed for take-off. The plane veered off the runway and crashed into a house.
