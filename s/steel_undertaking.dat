The NPS performed tests to assess the suitability of a replacement for the iron bars. Ferralium, a steel-aluminum alloy, was decided on for the flat bars that connect the secondary framework to the armature. However, the approximately 1800 iron armature bars that were replaced were made from a 316L stainless steel. As the armatures provide the structural support for the copper skin, {{it was suggested that}} no more than four bars of one of four different sections of the statue be replaced (a total of sixteen bars could only be removed from the statue at any given time), and which were replicated (mostly by eye), had to be back in place of the corroded bars within 36 hours of their removal.

40|$|Abstract Descriptions of high {{temperature}} creep deformation often use {{the concept of}} the effective stress, which includes the presence of the internal stress. Many experimental techniques have been applied to measure the internal stress induced by creep deformation. However, there is still a debate about the validity of the measured values. This is partly because the distinction between internal stress and material internal resistance is unclear. In this paper, neutron diffraction measurements, undertaken using the spallation source at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK, are combined with in-situ loading to investigate the internal state of a Type 316 H stainless <b>steel.</b> By <b>undertaking</b> measurements of the lattice strain for different grain families, before, during and after mechanical loading, the internal stress and internal resistance induced by prior creep were determined. The results show that these two parameters are important measures of the internal state, each changing during creep and influencing creep deformation rate. Additionally, internal stress is shown to be dependent on specific crystallographic planes of each grain family. The results are discussed with respect to the underlying mechanisms of creep deformation in stainless steel...|$|R

To investigate this hypothesis, dry sliding ball-on-disc wear tests of TiAlN/VN coatings on flat stainless <b>steel</b> substrates were <b>undertaken</b> against Al 2 O 3 at 25 C, 300 C and 635 C in air. The coating exhibited increased wear rate with temperature. The friction coefficient was 0. 53 at 25 C, which increased to 1. 03 at 300 C and decreased to 0. 46 at 635 C. Detailed investigation of the worn surfaces was undertaken using site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) via focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy, along with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. Microstructure and tribo-induced chemical reactions at these temperatures were correlated with the coating’s wear and friction behaviour. The friction behaviour at room temperature is attributed to the presence of a thin hydrated tribofilm and the presence of V 2 O 5 at high temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{cutting tool}} {{industry}} {{has evolved over}} {{the last half century}} to the point where an increasing range and complexity of cutting tools are available for metal machining. This highlighted a need to provide an intelligent, user-friendly system of tool selection and recommendation that can also provide predictive economic performance data for engineers and end-users alike. Such an 'expert system' was developed for a local manufacturer of cutting tools {{in the form of a}} relational database to be accessed over the Internet. A number of performance predictive models were reviewed for various machining processes, however they did not encompass the wide range of variables encountered in metal machining, thus adaptation of these existing models for an expert system was reasoned to be economically prohibitive at this time. Interrogation of published expert systems from cutting tool manufacturers, showed the knowledge-engineered principle to be a common approach to transferring economic and technological information to an end-user. The key advantage being the flexibility to allow further improvements as new knowledge is gained. As such, a relational database was built upon the knowledge-engineered principle, based on skilled craft oriented knowledge to establish an expert system for selection and performance assessment of cutting tools. An investigation into tapping of austenitic stainless <b>steels</b> was <b>undertaken</b> to develop part of a larger expert system.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the strains around the immediate vicinity of a crack tip to encompass the plastic zone in 4140 <b>steel</b> specimens was <b>undertaken.</b> Each specimen was subjected to a cyclic loading in air with a KI of 24. 2 MPa√m to generate a fatigue crack around 5. 7 mm.

During the overloading process only the specimens in an SCC environment were subjected to crack activity as expected. For this reason method that hydrogen attacks steel (hydrogen embrittlement) was a point of curiosity as well. Three SCC specimens were prepared to stay within different phases: i) no crack growth, ii) onset of crack growth and iii) crack growth of ~ 1 mm.

40|$|An in situ surface {{study of}} the carbon dioxide {{corrosion}} of mild <b>steel</b> has been <b>undertaken</b> using the tandem technique of mixed potential/synchrotron radiation-grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (SR-GIXRD). Long-term monitoring of the mixed potential showed there was an initial shift toward cathodic potentials attributable to preferential suppression of the cathodic half-reaction (viz., the reduction of carbonic acid), {{probably due to the}} formation of an adlayer of corrosion product physically blocking the cathodic reaction sites during the uniform corrosion of mild steel. Subsequently, the mixed potential displayed a gradual shift to anodic potentials, symbolizing the preferential suppression of the anodic half-reaction as the primary corrosion products [viz., Fe 2 (OH) 2 CO 3, Fe 2 O 2 (CO 3), Fe 6 (OH) 12 (CO 3), and Fe 6 (OH) 12 (CO 3) · 2 H 2 O] acquired a sufficient thickness to physically block the interface against further corrosion. Nevertheless, the corrosion product continues to grow over time, indicating that the corrosion product is discontinuous and porous, allowing the ingression of electrolyte to enable the further corrosion of the mild steel. This research has important ramifications for the field of corrosion research; it should enable researchers to develop improved methods of chemical inhibition by using compounds that can actually bind to the newly postulated corrosion products on mild steel...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the <b>steel</b> {{industry}} has <b>undertaken</b> {{efforts to increase}} energy efficiency by reducing energy consumption and recover otherwise lost heat. About 60 % of the energy consumed in a steel plant is lost in cooling beds where the hot steel beams are cooled down by natural convection and radiation. In this paper, the potential of heat recovery by radiation in a cooling bed was determined. Firstly, numerical simulations of the heat flux were done and validated with experimental measures. Secondly, a pilot test to recover the heat with modified solar absorbers was installed {{at the side of}} the cooling bed. The standard solar panels were painted with high absorption paint in the wavelength range of the hot beams. The results showed that up to 1 kW/m 2 could be recovered with a temperature of 70 °C {{at the side of the}} cooling bed, with a thermal efficiency of approximately 40 %. As the experimental results were promising, further research is suggested to find an adequate selective coating and glazing. This would maximize the absorption at the wavelength range of the hot beams and minimize the emissivity at operational temperature of the absorber (100 °C). Additionally, it would be of interest to find the optimum position for the absorbers in the cooling bed, which maximizes the heat recovery and does not interfere in the production process...|$|R

At first, the post-divestiture performance did not differ much between the two subject industries. However, by the 1930 s, competition intensified in petroleum refining {{and the decline of}} the Standard Oil fragments' market shares came to a halt. In the steel industry, however, competition continued to be mild. A lethargic United States Steel held a price um brella over its rivals and steadily lost market share. Steel companies were ill-prepared for rising import competition during the 1960 s and 1970 s. The paper concludes that the 1911 break-up of Standard Oil had few deleterious short-run consequences and, by shaping a more competitive environment, it had a decidedly positive long-run effect. antitrust; Sherman act; monopoly; divestiture, JEL classifications: L 12, L 41,...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{deformation}} and fracture {{behavior of}} AISI 403, a tempered {{martensitic stainless steel}} for end fitting component application of Pressurized heavy water reactor is being reported. The deformation behavior studies entailed characterization of tensile behaviour in the temperature range 77 K- 873 K for the as received and the fine grained Nb modified variant of AISI 403. The study of elevated tensile behavior in the two <b>steels</b> has been <b>undertaken</b> {{with the purpose of}} characterizing the strain rate – temperature domain of the occurrence of dynamic strain aging (DSA) phenomenon. In both steels, while the temperature range for the manifestations of characteristic anomalies in the tensile curve due to DSA was observed within 523 K – 673 K, the strain rate domain for the fine grain Nb variety was significantly higher as compared with the as-received variety. The low temperature tensile tests for the as received AISI 403 revealed the presence of pseudo-alloy softening temperature range 273 - 193 K. The effect of high DBTT of the AISI 403 steel was shown by the fracture toughness tests in the J-integral format at room temperature that displayed significant scatter in the samples with high in-plane and out-of-plane constraint. Samples with lower constraint showing stable crack growth were further tested at high temperature to obtain the temperature dependence of initiation toughness and propagation toughness. Within the DSA temperature a sharp decline in the fracture properties was observed. A mechanistic interpretation for the manifestations of the various observed phenomena is presented...|$|R
40|$|Stationary {{shoulder}} {{friction stir welding}} is a {{newly developed}} technique currently used for joining plates of relatively soft metals at different angular planes. Although the process is not currently applicable to steel, a study to investigate the theoretical and technical viability of stationary shoulder technology in DH 36 <b>steel</b> has been <b>undertaken.</b> Aluminium welds were produced using both conventional rotating shoulder and stationary shoulder friction stir welding techniques, whereas steel welds were produced using only conventional friction stir welding techniques. The effects of stationary shoulder technology on both the microstructural evolution and resultant mechanical properties of aluminium have been evaluated so that the likely effects on steel could be predicted. In the aluminium welds, the stationary shoulder technique results in a distinct transition between stirred and unstirred material, {{in contrast to the}} gradual change typically seen in conventional friction stir welds produced with a rotating shoulder. An investigation of weld properties produced in DH 36 steel has demonstrated that the microstructure likely to be formed, if the stationary shoulder weld technique was used, would be dominated by a bainitic ferrite phase and so would exhibit hardness and tensile properties in excess of the parent material. It is predicted that if the same abrupt transition between unstirred and stirred material, as seen in aluminium, occurred in steel this would lead to crack initiation followed by rapid propagation through the relatively brittle weld microstructure. Hence the findings demonstrate that stationary shoulder friction stir welding is unlikely to be applicable to steel without further design and process developments...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{evaluation of}} the influence of grain normalization (refinement as a result of repeated austenitizing), cooling rate after repeated austenitizing on the morphology of hypereutectoid cementite and fracture toughness of G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 6 - 3 cast steel. Moreover, the elimination of hypereutectoid cementite in structure of Widmannstätten type precipitates from the structure of investigated cast <b>steel</b> has been <b>undertaken.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Basic research of G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 6 - 3 cast steel included metallographic analysis and fracture toughness research (impact strength, stress intensity factor KIc). The heat treatment has been planned on the basis of CCT diagram prepared for that cast steel. Findings: Heat treatment of investigated cast steel allows to refine the grain and eliminate from it’s structure the hypereutectoid cementite in structure of Widmannstätten type. At very low cooling rate the precipitates of hypereutectoid cementite become partially coagulated. The study {{of the influence of}} cooling rate on the mechanical properties of G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 6 - 3 cast steel had proven that elimination of hypereutectoid cementite in structure of Widmannstätten type from the investigated cast steel structure to small degree increases it’s fracture toughness.

Design/methodology/approach: The microstructure of new 12 % chromium steel developed for advanced power stations operated around 625 - 650 °C, has been characterized in order to correlate its structural parameters with steel creep properties. Microstructure of the as received condition has a significant influence on creep resistance of 9 - 12 % Cr steels operating at elevated temperatures. Quantitative TEM analyses of <b>steel</b> microstructure were <b>undertaken</b> to determine the dislocation density within the sub-grain, {{the width of the}} martensite laths/sub-grains and the particle parameters (shape, size, distribution). Phase identification was performed using electron diffraction and X-ray spectrometry. The influence of the austenitisation temperature (1060 - 1100 ºC) on the microstructure of the VM 12 steel with 145 ppm boron was investigated. Findings: The results show that increase of the austenisation temperature caused slight increasing of a sub-grain size and decreasing of dislocation density within sub-grains in the steel tempered at 780 ºC. The M 23 C 6 and MX particle size was not significantly changed. Quantitative TEM analyses of the VM 12 steel microstructure showed that favorable characteristics exhibit the steel which was austenised at 1060 °C. Research limitations/implications: The present study is focused on the influence of temperature of autenitisation on the microstructure of the VM 12 steel with 145 ppm boron. The quantitative parameters of the VM 12 microstructure were determined.

The occurrence of an EP plateau has been observed {{in view of the}} optimization of MEP process. Up-to-date stainless steel surface studies always indicated some amount of free-metal atoms apart from the detected oxides and hydroxides. Such a morphology of the surface film usually affects the thermodynamic stability and corrosion resistance of surface oxide layer {{and is one of the}} most important features of stainless steels. With this new MEP process we can improve metal surface properties by making the stainless steel more resistant to halides encountered in a variety of environments. Furthermore, in this paper the stainless steel surface film study results have been presented. The results of the corrosion research carried out by the authors on the behaviour of the most commonly used material - medical grade AISI 316 L stainless steel both in Ringer’s body fluid and in aqueous 3 % NaCl solution have been investigated and presented earlier elsewhere, though some of these results, concerning the EIS Nyquist plots and polarization curves are also revealed herein. In this paper an attempt to explain this peculiar performance of 316 L stainless <b>steel</b> has been <b>undertaken.</b> The SEM studies, Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were performed on 316 L samples after three treatments: MP – abrasive polishing (800 grit size), EP – conventional electrolytic polishing, and MEP – magnetoelectropolishing.

40|$|Baseplate connections, {{typically}} {{consisting of}} a steel baseplate welded to the terminus of a structural member, concrete anchors, and grout, are common features in buildings and nonbuilding structures. Incorporation of yielding anchors in these critical connections has received increased attention due to good performance observed during recent earthquakes. Such a strategy is attractive as a design approach, as the connections can provide a fuse {{at the location of}} seismic input, add to overall system ductility, and may elongate the system period. However, neither a systematic study of connection details that permit robust performance with yielding anchors, nor an investigation of the potential benefits of using such connections to reduce system-level seismic demands has been performed to date. 	To these ends, a suite of baseplate component and system-level tests, as well as complimentary high-fidelity numerical simulations, was undertaken to systematically investigate detailing options to help advance the innovative concept of yielding-anchor base connections. First, a program of pseudo-static testing of a typical exposed steel column baseplate connection was executed to understand the details that may influence connection performance, including the anchor type, constituent materials, anchor stretch length, and connection setting arrangement. The impacts of these details on connection strength and rotation capacity are quantified. A novel categorization scheme of connection limit states was developed to track the evolution of damage in the connection. A 3 -D, fiber-section numerical model was developed and verified against the results of this test program and several others available in the literature, providing a robust, generalized predictive method for the response of connections with parameters outside the current test program. 	Subsequently, dynamic shake table testing of a miniature <b>steel</b> building was <b>undertaken</b> to probe the beneficial system-level effects that ductile, uplifting baseplate connections may have versus traditional "strong anchor" connections and superstructure fuses. These benefits were readily observed in testing and found in numerical analyses including reductions in total base shear of up to 50 % and the virtual elimination of residual drift when compared to traditional systems. These results, combined with the ease of post-earthquake repair, demonstrate the usefulness of the ductile-anchor approach in improving overall seismic performance...|$|R
40|$|High speed {{machining}} {{was developed}} over {{sixty years ago}} and at present is still limited {{to just a few}} materials, these being aluminium and its alloys, hardened steels for the mould and die industry and titanium for aerospace applications. Recently there has been additional work in high speed machining on some of the more exotic aerospace alloys such as inconel and nimonic alloys. This thesis addresses the problems encountered when machining high chromium/nickel steel alloys {{that are part of the}} stainless steel family. Three grades of stainless steel were selected for this purpose, these being a martensitic grade (416) and two austenitic grades (303 & 316). These materials were high speed milled at cuttinspeeds of up to 3, 000 m min- 1, via the use of two machining methodologies; high torque-low speed and low torque-high speed milling. High torque-low speed milling was accomplished through the use of specially designed large diameter dual-plane balanced face mills, that when rotated at 6, 000 rev mon- 1 generated a cuting speed of 3, 000 m min- 1. These cutters were capable of machining three grades of stainless steel at approximately ten times that of the cutting speeds normally selected for materials that are cut conventionally. However, at the elevated cutting speeds machining of the two austenitic grades of stainless steel exhibited high tool wear rates which contributed to both poor surface finish and high cutting forces. The lo torque-high speed machining of these stainless <b>steel</b> grades was <b>undertaken</b> via specifically designed variable axial rake angle cutters in conjunction with a gear-driven speed increaser. This head gave a maxiumum cutting speed of 750 m min- 1 when the cutters were rotated at 20, 000 rev min- 1. Experiments indicated that the three grades of stainless steel could be machined at high rotational speeds, with good surface finish produced with negative axial rake angled tools. This machining strategy caused tool 'ironing' of the machined surface. cutting forces were lower at all cutting speeds when a positive axial rake angled tool was employed, although at elevated cutting speeds tool wear was excessive regardless of any axia rake angle geometry...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports a}} case study in the design and construction solutions for a major corrosion failure of the aluminium louvres and steel brackets on the roof and façade of levels 26 - 29 of the Westfield Tower 2, Bondi Junction. This work was undertaken during early 2005. Aims: &# 149;	Consideration of the roles and responsibilities of designer and engineer working on metallurgical corrosion issues in high-rise buildings &# 149;	Undertaking of a literature survey of corrosion issues involving riveting and welding of aluminium and galvanising of <b>steel</b> &# 149;	<b>Undertaking</b> of stress calculations for all components to ensure compliance with the requirements of design principles &# 149;	Confirmation of the stress calculations through finite element modelling &# 149;	Examination of all materials issues in order to prevent re-occurrence of structural degradation and corrosion &# 149;	Consideration of relevant environmental effects on the materials &# 149;	Implementation of these design solutions using novel aerospace materials and methods &# 149;	Prediction of future performance through factorial and matrix method approaches. Outcomes: &# 149;	It is hoped that the text provides a documentary basis for future guidance of designers and engineers working in areas related to the subject of the present work. &# 149;	It also is hoped that the work on aerospace technologies will broaden the scope of designers and engineers in the potential that these materials and processes have in building considerations. &# 149;	The manual stress calculations and finite element modelling confirm that the implemented designs are consistently within design specification and that, from the mechanical perspective, no problems are anticipated. &# 149;	Further, since considerable care was taken to ensure that galvanic and other forms of corrosion were avoided through the appropriate use of design, materials, and implementation approaches, no further corrosion has been observed at the site. &# 149;	The development of a generic factorial approach and a specific matrix method, applied to corrosion and welding considerations, was informative but these still are at speculative stages owing to the difficulty of obtaining relevant meaningful data and the problem of assigning weighting factors on what is viewed as a fairly subjective basis...|$|R
40|$|TiAlN/VN multilayers, {{with a layer}} {{periodicity}} of ~ 3 nm, have exhibited superior sliding {{wear resistance}} (1. 26 xlO- 17 m 3 N-lm-l) and lower friction coefficient (~= 0. 4, pin-on-disc test, Ah 03 ball counterpart) {{when compared to other}} commonly used wear protective coatings, e. g. TiN, TiAlN and TiAlN/CrN. They require excellent oxidation and wear resistance for dry high speed machining operations. This project investigates the microstructure of the as-deposited coatings, their oxidation degradation mechanism and their wear and friction properties at room and elevated temperatures. The microstructure of the starting films was studied in terms of intermixing between the TiAlN and VN individual layers caused by the absence of shutters during the industrial PVD deposition. A FEGTEM coupled with EELS revealed chemical distribution of individual layers at nanometre resolution. Cs corrected STEM allowed the composition of individual atomic columns to be imaged. It was also used to probe across the interface of TiAlN/VN with angstrom beam (1 A) using EELS which showed a 1 ± 0. 1 nm thick intermixing between TiAlN and VN. Film growth and elemental distributions were therefore theoretically predicted in association with substrate rotation. The experimental compositional profiles and the prediction showed good agreement. The coatings deposited with - 75 V and - 85 V substrate bias voltage were multilayer TiAlNNN, 37 at%:::;V:::; 55 at%, 0. 81 :::;(Ti+Al) /V:::; 1. 73, which were used for subsequent oxidation and wear studies. The oxidation behaviour of these coatings in air was investigated using thermal gravimetric analysis up to 1000 °C and compared to TiN and TiAlN. Static oxidation of TiAlN/VN films was studied in the range 550 - 700 °C, and characterised by high temperature in-situ X-ray diffraction and STEM/EDXlEELS of selected surface cross-sections. The oxidation resistance of TiAlN/VN was found to be controlled by the VN layers and consequently oxidation was initiated at a lower temperature than TiN and TiAlN coatings. The onset for rapid oxidation of the TiAlN/VN coating was found to be 2550 °C. At temperatures > 600 °C, a duplex oxide structure was formed; the inner layer comprised a porous region of Ti-rich and V-rich nanocrystallites, while several phases were observed in the outer region, including V 20 5, Ti 02 and AlV 04. V 20 5 was the dominant oxide at the outer layer at 2638 °C. An Au marker study suggested roughly equal diffusivity of cations outward and oxygen inward diffusion occurred during oxidation. Further to the oxidation study, dry sliding ball-on-disc wear tests of TiAlN/VN (V 55. 2 at%, Ti 28. 5 at% and Al 16. 3 at%) coatings on flat stainless <b>steel</b> substrates were <b>undertaken</b> against Ah 03 at 25 °C, 300 °C and 635 °C in air to investigate the relation between the presence of V 205 and low friction. The friction coefficient was 0. 53 at 25 °C which increased to 1. 03 at 300 °C and decreased to 0. 46 at 635 °C. Detailed investigation of the worn surfaces was undertaken using site-specific TEM via FIB, along with FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. Microstructure and tribo-induced chemical reactions at these temperatures were correlated with the coating's wear and friction behaviour. The friction behaviour at room temperature is attributed to the presence of a thin hydrated tribofilm and the presence of V 205 at high temperature.
