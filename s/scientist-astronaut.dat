5|$|Apollo 17 was {{the last}} of the Apollo program, landing in the Taurus-Littrow region in December 1972. Eugene Cernan {{commanded}} Ronald E. Evans and NASA's first <b>scientist-astronaut,</b> geologist Dr. Harrison H. Schmitt. Schmitt was originally scheduled for Apollo 18, but the lunar geological community lobbied for his inclusion on the final lunar landing. Cernan and Schmitt stayed on the surface for just over three days and spent just over 23 hours of total EVA.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Lind {{expressed}} interest in being assigned to the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the final mission of the Apollo program; ultimately, Brand was assigned as Command Module Pilot alongside senior managers Slayton (who assigned himself to the mission as Docking Module Pilot after being medically grounded {{for most of the}} space program) and Commander Thomas P. Stafford. He was reassigned to the Science and Applications Directorate in 1974, formally codifying his status as a <b>scientist-astronaut.</b>|$|E
25|$|Along with geologist-astronaut Harrison Schmitt, Lind {{helped to}} develop and {{demonstrate}} the flight plan for the Apollo 11 EVA (including the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Packages that would continue to relay data following the missions) and other tools used on the lunar surface. He {{also served as a}} capsule communicator on the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. Schmitt, Owen Garriott and Lind were the only scientist-astronauts to receive advanced helicopter training, a key prerequisite for piloting the Apollo Lunar Module. Due to standard crew rotations, it is believed that Lind would have followed Schmitt as the second <b>scientist-astronaut</b> Lunar Module Pilot on one of the canceled Apollo missions or projected long-range Apollo Applications Program lunar survey missions.|$|E

25|$|In December 1972, {{as one of}} {{the crew}} on board Apollo 17, Schmitt became the first member of NASA's first <b>scientist-astronaut</b> group to fly in space. As Apollo 17 was the last of the Apollo missions, he also became the twelfth and second {{youngest}} person to set foot on the Moon, and the second-to-last person to step off of the Moon (he boarded the Lunar Module shortly before commander Eugene Cernan). Schmitt also remains the first and only professional scientist to have flown beyond low Earth orbit and to have visited the Moon. He was influential within the community of geologists supporting the Apollo program and, before starting his own preparations for an Apollo mission, {{had been one of the}} scientists training those Apollo astronauts chosen to visit the lunar surface.|$|E
500|$|O'Neill saw great {{potential}} in the United States space program, especially the Apollo missions. He applied to the Astronaut Corps after NASA opened it up to civilian scientists in 1966. Later, when asked why {{he wanted to go}} on the Moon missions, he said, [...] "to be alive now and not take part in it seemed terribly myopic". He was put through NASA's rigorous mental and physical examinations. During this time he met Brian O'Leary, also a <b>scientist-astronaut</b> candidate, who became his good friend. O'Leary was selected for Astronaut Group 6 but O'Neill was not.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparing}} for their mission, {{in addition to}} the usual Apollo spacecraft training, Young and Duke, along with backup commander Fred Haise, underwent an extensive geological training program that included several field trips to introduce them to concepts and techniques they would use in analyzing features and collecting samples on the lunar surface. During these trips, they visited and provided scientific descriptions of geologic features they were likely to encounter. In July 1971, they visited Sudbury, Ontario, Canada for geology training exercises, the first time U.S. astronauts did so. Geologists chose the area because of a [...] wide crater created about 1.8 billion years ago by a large meteorite. The Sudbury Basin shows evidence of shatter cone geology familiarizing the Apollo crew with geologic evidence of a meteor impact. During the training exercises the astronauts did not wear space suits, but carried radio equipment to converse with each other and <b>scientist-astronaut</b> Anthony W. England, practicing procedures they would use on the lunar surface.|$|E

500|$|While he {{was waiting}} for his paper to be published, O'Neill {{organized}} a small two-day conference in May 1974 at Princeton to discuss the possibility of colonizing outer space. The conference, titled First Conference on Space Colonization, was funded by Stewart Brand's Point Foundation and Princeton University. Among those who attended were Eric Drexler (at the time a freshman at MIT), <b>scientist-astronaut</b> Joe Allen (from Astronaut Group 6), Freeman Dyson, and science reporter Walter Sullivan. Representatives from NASA also attended and brought estimates of launch costs expected on the planned Space Shuttle. O'Neill thought of the attendees as [...] "a band of daring radicals". Sullivan's article on the conference was published {{on the front page of}} The New York Times on May 13, 1974. As media coverage grew, O'Neill was inundated with letters from people who were excited about living in space. To stay in touch with them, O'Neill began keeping a mailing list and started sending out updates on his progress. A few months later he heard Peter Glaser speak about solar power satellites at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. O'Neill realized that, by building these satellites, his space colonies could quickly recover the cost of their construction. According to O'Neill, [...] "the profound difference between this and everything else done in space is the potential of generating large amounts of new wealth".|$|E
2500|$|Amid {{the gradual}} {{cancellation}} of the later Apollo missions and the devolution of the AAP into Project Skylab, Lind was formally reassigned to the latter program in August 1969; according to Slayton, who noted Lind's disappointment, [...] "with the cancellation of [...] 20, I could see I just wasn't {{going to have a}} flight for him." [...] Together, Lind and Group 6 <b>scientist-astronaut</b> William B. Lenoir comprised the Earth Resources Group of the Skylab Branch Office.|$|E

5000|$|The {{organization}} was established {{with the intent}} of training groups of <b>scientist-astronauts</b> and making them available for hire. Research institutions, principal investigators and private spaceflight companies would engage these individuals to conduct experiments in suborbital and eventually orbital space, as opposed to sending their own personnel on these missions.|$|R
50|$|For the Space Shuttle program, Lind was reassigned as a Mission Specialist {{along with}} McCandless and the {{remaining}} Apollo-era <b>scientist-astronauts.</b> During this period, {{he was a member}} of the Astronaut Office's Operations Missions development group, responsible for developing payloads for the early Space Shuttle Orbital Flight Test (OFT) missions and the Canadarm.|$|R

5000|$|In {{an article}} dated October 7, 1966, the journal Science {{discussed}} NASA <b>scientist-astronaut</b> program recruitment efforts: To quote an Academy brochure, the quality most needed by a <b>scientist-astronaut</b> is [...] "perspicacity." [...] He must, the brochure says, {{be able to}} quickly pick out, from among the thousands of things he sees, those that are significant, and to synthesize observations and develop and test working hypotheses.|$|E
50|$|Michel was {{selected}} as a NASA <b>scientist-astronaut</b> in June 1965. He resigned from NASA in September 1969 without having being assigned to any spaceflight missions. Michel {{believed that it was}} his decision to resign, after it became clear {{that he would not be}} given a flight assignment, that motivated the scientific community to demand that his fellow <b>scientist-astronaut</b> Harrison Schmitt be reassigned to Apollo 17 after Schmitt's planned mission on Apollo 18 was cancelled.|$|E

Extensive experiments were conducted of the Sun, of Earth resources and in various life sciences relating to human adaptation to weightlessness.|$|R
