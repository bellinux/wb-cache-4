5|$|Before {{the company}} was <b>shuttered</b> after {{producing}} Halo Wars, Ensemble Studios {{had been working on}} a Halo-themed massively multiplayer online game, often referred to as Titan Project, or just Titan. The project was cancelled internally in 2007–2008, without a formal announcement from Microsoft.|$|E
50|$|Interchangeable-lens cameras with {{a central}} <b>shutter</b> within the lens body require that each lens has a <b>shutter</b> built into it. In {{practice}} most cameras with interchangeable lenses use a single focal plane <b>shutter</b> in the camera body for all lenses, while cameras with a fixed lens use a central <b>shutter.</b> Many medium-format and most large-format cameras, however, have interchangeable lenses each fitted {{with a central}} <b>shutter.</b> A few interchangeable-lens cameras have a behind-the-lens leaf <b>shutter.</b> Large-format press cameras often had a focal-plane <b>shutter.</b> Some had both a focal-plane <b>shutter</b> (for lens interchangeability) and a lens with central <b>shutter</b> (for flash synchronisation); one <b>shutter</b> would be locked open.|$|R
50|$|Other {{interior}} <b>shutters</b> use stationary louvers {{that do not}} rotate (fixed louvers); solid raised or flat panels; fabric inserts; or tinted glass. <b>Shutters</b> can be configured in {{a single}} tier unit that has one <b>shutter</b> top to bottom of a window opening as well as multiple tiers. Multiple tier units feature separate <b>shutters</b> on each tier which allows the top <b>shutters</b> to be opened independently from the bottom <b>shutters.</b> Café-type <b>shutters</b> refer to <b>shutters</b> that only cover the lower portion of a window.|$|R
5000|$|Focal plane <b>shutters</b> {{have the}} {{advantage}} over central leaf <b>shutters</b> of allowing the use of interchangeable lenses without requiring a separate <b>shutter</b> for each lens. (Leaf <b>shutters</b> behind the lens also allow interchanging the lens using a single <b>shutter.)</b> ...|$|R
5|$|After {{nearly six}} years {{since it was}} {{initially}} proposed, ground was broken for the station in September 2005. The official dedication for the $3.2 million facility occurred on August 12, 2006, with Governor Jim Doyle, U.S. Representative Paul Ryan and Racine County Executive Bill McReynolds in attendance. Service would be discontinued at the 1901-depot the following day with the new facility opening for passenger service on August 14, 2006. The <b>shuttered,</b> 1901 station would subsequently be deconstructed and relocated to Caledonia between August and October 2009.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1979, {{the number}} of Grønlandsfly {{passengers}} served annually exceeded 60,000, more than the population of Greenland. That year, the airline's first international route was also opened, running between Greenland's capital Nuuk {{and the town of}} Iqaluit in northern Canada. The route connected Greenland's Kalaallit with Canada's Inuit and was operated in conjunction with the Canadian First Air line, but the planes were generally run empty and the route was <b>shuttered</b> 13 years later.|$|E
5|$|Civilian {{return to}} the town was slow, with shops still <b>shuttered</b> on 16 December. Civilian {{casualty}} reports were conflicting: one resident claimed 15 dead bodies lay in a single street and another that his family were dead under rubble. The coalition rejected such claims, admitting only that two children had been injured, and possibly killed, when a car driving at high speeds towards ISAF troops during the battle overturned when the driver was shot dead.|$|E
2500|$|The Source Four is {{the first}} fixture to feature a {{rotating}} <b>shutter</b> barrel, which makes framing objects much easier regardless of lamp orientation.

50|$|Almost all {{contemporary}} SLRs use a focal-plane <b>shutter</b> {{located in}} front of the film plane, which prevents the light from reaching the film even if the lens is removed, except when the <b>shutter</b> is actually released during the exposure. There are various designs for focal plane <b>shutters.</b> Early focal-plane <b>shutters</b> designed from the 1930s onwards usually consisted of two curtains that travelled horizontally across the film gate: an opening <b>shutter</b> curtain followed by a closing <b>shutter</b> curtain. During fast <b>shutter</b> speeds, the focal-plane <b>shutter</b> would form a 'slit' whereby the second <b>shutter</b> curtain was closely following the first opening <b>shutter</b> curtain to produce a narrow, vertical opening, with the <b>shutter</b> slit moving horizontally. The slit would get narrower as <b>shutter</b> speeds were increased. Initially these <b>shutters</b> were made from a cloth material (which was in later years often rubberised), but some manufacturers used other materials instead. Nippon Kōgaku (now Nikon Corporation), for example, used titanium foil <b>shutters</b> for several of their flagship SLR cameras, including the Nikon F, F2, and F3.|$|R

5|$|Harry Innes' {{libel suit}} against Joseph Street was not fully {{adjudicated}} in the Jessamine County Circuit Court until 1811. The jury found in Innes' favor and awarded $750 in damages, although Innes' counsel, Henry Clay and Robert Wickliffe, insisted that Innes only desired the vindication of a guilty verdict against Street {{and would not}} collect the damages. Soon after, Street <b>shuttered</b> the Western World and moved to Illinois.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, under {{pressure}} from Chinese authorities, the Vietnamese government tried two Falun Gong practitioners who had been operating a shortwave radio station and broadcasting information into China. The pair was charged with unlicensed broadcasting, and sentenced to 2 and 3 years in prison. Earlier in the same year, another radio station operated by Falun Gong practitioners in Indonesia, Radio Erabaru, was <b>shuttered</b> under diplomatic pressure from China.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, West {{revealed}} {{plans to}} open 10 Fatburger restaurants in the Chicago area; the first was set to open in September 2008 in Orland Park. The second followed in January 2009, while a third location {{is yet to be}} revealed, although the process is being finalized. His company, KW Foods LLC, bought the rights to the chain in Chicago. Ultimately, in 2009, only two locations actually opened. In February 2011, West shut down the Fatburger located in Orland Park. Later that year, the remaining Beverly location also was <b>shuttered.</b>|$|E

50|$|A central <b>shutter</b> {{is not a}} type of <b>shutter</b> as such, but {{describes}} {{the position of the}} shutter: it is typically a leaf <b>shutter</b> (or simple leaf <b>shutter),</b> and located within the lens assembly where a relatively small opening allows light to cover the entire image. Leaf <b>shutters</b> can also be located behind, but near, the lens, allowing lens interchangeability. The alternative to a central or behind-the-lens <b>shutter</b> is a focal-plane <b>shutter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some {{models have}} both a focal plane <b>shutter</b> and an iris lens <b>shutter.</b> The focal plane <b>shutter</b> allows for fast <b>shutter</b> speeds {{and the use}} of lenses which do not have an {{integral}} <b>shutter</b> (known as a barrel lens), while the iris <b>shutter</b> allows for flash synchronization at any speed. The Graphlex Speed Graphic models [...] and the Ihagee Zweiverschluss ("two shutters") Duplex are examples of press cameras that had both focal plane and iris <b>shutters.</b>|$|R
5|$|One of the {{above-mentioned}} exceptions was a 1986 {{release of the}} film for the now-obsolete VHD video disc system (not {{to be confused with}} LaserDisc). This required a special 3D VHD player, or a standard VHD player with a hardware 3D adapter, and a set of LCD glasses that <b>shuttered</b> the viewer's eyes according to control signals sent by the player, allowing the polarised 3D effect to work. The other exception was the Sensio 3D DVD of Jaws 3-D released in February 2008. The Sensio 3D Processor is needed for 3D home viewing.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the London Missionary Society missionaries, whose primary activity was teaching Christian theology and literacy at their newly established schools using the Bible as the principal Malagasy-language text, departed the island. James Cameron and other key missionaries preferred to leave rather than remain on the island without authorization to proselytize. The last two remaining missionaries chose to continue teaching practical skills {{in the hope that}} the restrictions might loosen, but one year later, after receiving indirect information that the government desired their departure, they <b>shuttered</b> the LMS mission and left Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of infrastructure {{must also be}} considered within emergency preparedness. Critical facilities that need to remain operable should be identified, and all others should be shut down to reduce damage. It is also important to keep ash out of buildings, machinery and lifeline networks (in particular water and wastewater systems,) to prevent some of the damage caused by ash particles. Windows and doors should be closed and <b>shuttered</b> if possible, to prevent ingress of ash into buildings.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} Soviet-era rangefinders, the <b>shutter</b> speed {{selector}} rotates when the <b>shutter</b> is released, {{and should not}} be changed until after the <b>shutter</b> has been cocked. If the <b>shutter</b> speed is changed without cocking the <b>shutter</b> first, the setting pin can be broken when the film is advanced.|$|R
50|$|These two {{photographs}} are taken under same situation except for camera <b>shutter</b> speed. In above situation, slow <b>shutter</b> speed makes image more clear and bright because the low <b>shutter</b> speed takes more light than high <b>shutter</b> speed. However, the high <b>shutter</b> speed often {{is necessary for}} moving object.|$|R
50|$|Interior <b>shutters</b> are {{typically}} divided into narrow units hinged accordion-style so that {{two or more}} units cover each side of a window opening when closed. Operable louvered <b>shutters</b> have louvers (or louvres in British usage), or slats, controlled by a tilt bar or rod to adjust the louver position and keep them in a uniform position, to control light, visibility and airflow. <b>Shutters</b> with operable louvers are described variously as traditional <b>shutters,</b> California <b>shutters,</b> or plantation <b>shutters.</b> Plantation <b>shutters,</b> typical of warmer climates like Florida, South Africa, the Mediterranean or Australia, typically have only two <b>shutters</b> per window and wide louver blades.|$|R
5|$|Although {{usually more}} coins were struck at Philadelphia {{than at the}} other mints during the years the coin was struck in silver, only 12,450,181 were struck there in 1955, fewer than at the Denver Mint or at San Francisco. This was due to a sagging economy and a lackluster demand for coins that caused the Mint to {{announce}} in January that the San Francisco Mint would be <b>shuttered</b> {{at the end of}} the year. The 1955 dimes from the three facilities are the lowest mintages by date and mint mark among circulating coins in the series, but are not rare, as collectors stored them away in rolls of 50.|$|E
5|$|At 7:30am {{the next}} morning, the Duke of Wellington {{wrote to the}} Mayor of Liverpool from his lodgings in nearby Roby. He had been due to receive the Freedom of the City, but felt that under the {{circumstances}} any kind of celebration would be inappropriate, {{and said that he}} would not be attending any of the planned events in the city that day. The planned parades and ceremonial dinner were cancelled, but in the absence of rapid transit or mass communication there was no way to notify most of the city's population. While some shops had heard the news and remained <b>shuttered,</b> the ships in Liverpool's docks remained festooned with brightly coloured streamers, and sounded their horns at the time the Duke was expected to be passing.|$|E
5|$|Between 1869 and 1870, {{the society}} {{completed}} {{construction of a}} new two-story brick building on Lot 56 at the corner of West Main and North High Streets known as Literary Hall, where it could hold its meetings and reassemble the remaining volumes from its original library. Literary Hall was built upon the former location of the <b>shuttered</b> Bank of the South Branch of the Potomac. In addition to the 400 volumes that were initially recovered following the war, the society recovered several more volumes from its original library, and set about purchasing new books; the restored library was reopened with about 700 volumes.|$|E

5|$|Building {{materials}} vary greatly. Brick {{was rarely}} {{used at the}} time Round Hill was developing (although a few houses in Belton Road were built of it); bungaroosh was often used for walls instead. Characteristic of Brighton but almost unknown elsewhere, this consisted of random assortments of materials such as low-quality brick, cobbles, flints, pebbles, rubble, wood and sand, set in hydraulic lime and <b>shuttered.</b> Bungaroosh was often faced with render or stucco to make it weatherproof. Some flint buildings survive on Prince's Crescent. When built, most windows in the conservation area's houses were sashes, and roofs were of Welsh slate.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the living}} hut were two small ante-rooms, one {{used as a}} {{photographic}} darkroom, the other for taxidermy. Within the main accommodation area daylight was admitted via a double-glazed and <b>shuttered</b> window and through a small square pane high on the northern wall. Bunks were fitted around the outer walls, and a table and stove dominated {{the centre of the}} hut. During the few brief weeks before winter set in, members of the party made trial sledging journeys on the sea ice in nearby Robertson Bay, during which they surveyed the coastline and collected specimens of birds and fish. They also slaughtered seals and penguins for food and fuel. Outside activities were largely curtailed in Mid-May, with the onset of severe winter weather.|$|E
5|$|Music was {{the least}} {{restricted}} of cultural activities, probably because Hans Frank regarded himself as a fan of serious music. In time, he ordered {{the creation of the}} Orchestra and Symphony of the General Government in its capital, Kraków. Numerous musical performances were permitted in cafes and churches, and the Polish underground chose to boycott only the propagandist operas. Visual artists, including painters and sculptors, were compelled to register with the German government; but their work was generally tolerated by the underground, unless it conveyed propagandist themes. <b>Shuttered</b> museums were replaced by occasional art exhibitions that frequently conveyed propagandist themes.|$|E
50|$|When using a focal-plane <b>shutter</b> with a flash, if the <b>shutter</b> {{is set at}} its X-sync {{speed or}} slower the whole frame will be exposed when the flash fires (otherwise only a band of the film will be exposed).Some {{electronic}} flashes can produce a longer pulse compatible with a focal-plane <b>shutter</b> operated at much higher <b>shutter</b> speeds.
