5000|$|In Bavaria, lye {{pretzels}} accompany a main dish, such as Weisswurst sausage. The same {{dough and}} baking procedure <b>with</b> lye <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> {{is used to}} make other kinds of [...] "lye pastry" [...] (Laugengebäck): lye rolls, buns, croissants, and even loaves (Laugenbrötchen, Laugenstangen, Laugencroissants, Laugenbrot). Yet, {{in some parts of}} Bavaria, especially in lower Bavaria, unglazed [...] "white" [...] pretzels, <b>sprinkled</b> <b>with</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> caraway seeds are still popular. Basically, with the same ingredients, lye pretzels come in numerous local varieties. Sizes are usually similar; the main differences are the thickness of the dough, the content of fat and the degree of baking. Typical Swabian pretzels, for example, have very thin [...] "arms" [...] and a [...] "fat belly" [...] with a split, and a higher fat content. The thicker part makes it easier to slice them for the use of sandwiches. In Bavarian pretzels, the arms are left thicker so they do not bake to a crisp and contain very little fat.|$|R

50|$|This dish is {{prepared}} by first boiling the octopus inside a copper cauldron. Before actually boiling it, the octopus is repeatedly dipped {{in and out}} of the boiling water, held by its head. The objective of this operation is to curl the tips of the tentacles. The tentacles are preferred over the head, which sometimes is discarded. After the octopus has been boiled, it is trimmed <b>with</b> scissors, <b>sprinkled</b> <b>with</b> coarse <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> paprika (known in Galicia as pemento picante) and drizzled with olive oil. The optimal cooking point is the one in which octopus is not rubbery but not overcooked either, similarly to the al dente concept in Italian pasta cooking. This is achieved after approximately a 20 minutes boil, provided that the octopus is left to rest for a further 20 minutes inside the boiled water away from the fire.|$|R
50|$|Svið is {{prepared}} by first burning off the hair, then cleaning the head under running cold water while paying {{special attention to}} the eyes and ears. The head must then be sawn in half lengthwise and the brain removed; if it is frozen first, this is less messy. The brains can be cooked with the skin. When it is ready for cooking, it is put into a cooking pot, <b>sprinkled</b> <b>with</b> coarse <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> partly covered <b>with</b> water. When the water boils, the scum is skimmed off. The head can then be cooked covered for 60 to 90 minutes, until the flesh is cooked through but before it has begun to separate from the bone. It can then be served immediately, hot, or can be left to cool down {{so that it can be}} served cold.|$|R
40|$|It is {{rare for}} {{established}} food plants {{to be at}} risk from extinction, but that is the situation facing a group of plants which have a range of valuable characteristics. They are the yam beans (Pachyrhizus spp) and other tuber-forming legumes including Apios (Indian potato), Psophocarpus (winged bean) and Sphenostylis (African yam bean). All these species are natives of Latin America but despite their contribution to regional diets historically, changes in patterns of food production and consumption in recent years, and pressures on natural vegetation by expansion of introduced crops, overgrazing and urban industrial expansion, genetic resources are endangered. This group of plants offers a source of nutrition, dietary variety and nitrogen-fixing and green manuring capability. Some also contain compounds within their leaves, stems, ripe pods and seeds that are toxic to humans but have potentially useful insecticidal properties. In Central America yam beans are eaten raw, the peeled roots <b>sprinkled</b> <b>with</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> lemon juice. Roots can also be boiled, retaining their crunchy texture, or fried. The leaves can be used a green manure. Yields for P. erosus have been reported as reaching 80 tonnes per hectare in Mexico, Indonesia and the Philippines and it is possible that yields could be increased further through hybrid vigour. Recognizing the urgent need to implement conservation measures, the First International Symposium on Tuberous Legumes was held in Guadeloupe from 21 to 24 April 1992. CTA sponsored the Symposium together with the Centre INRA des Antilles et de la Guyane, the EC and the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Denmark. Participants came from Benin, Kenya, Senegal, Tonga and Trinidad as well as venue hosts Guadeloupe and others from the EC, Latin America, Thailand and the US. The proceedings of the seminar have now been published. They make it clear that these tuberous legumes offer several opportunities as vegetables, as sources of chemicals, as food for cattle and as a means for soil protection and improvement. To ensure conservation of these potentially very valuable plants participants recommended that a network be formed to provide interested researchers with an opportunity to collaborate, that a tuberous legume germplasm collection be established and that the network should coordinate the collection as part of its activities. The importance of the tuber legumes for dryland areas and other marginal habitats was stressed and it was recommended that research should continue.

40|$|Innerhalb der Vegetation der Inseln Bobara und Mrkan südlich von Dubrovnik kommen folgende Pflanzengesellschaften vor: Phagnalo-Centaureetum ragusinae, Asplenio- Vmbilicetum horizontalis, Limonietum anfracti, Lavateretum ruderale, Narcisso-Asphodeletum microcarpi, Erico-Calicotometum villosae und Orno-Quercetum ilicis. In diesem Beitrag werden zwei neue nitrophile Subassoziationen beschrieben: Narcisso-Asphodeletum microcarpi sisymbrieto- sum und Erico-Calicotometum villosae carduetosum nutantis. Der nitrophile Charakter dieser Vegetation steht in enger Verbindung mit dem Einfluss der Möwenkolonie (auf den beiden Inseln) und des Viehbestandes (nur auf der Insel Mrkan). Auf der Insel Bobara wird auch der Einfluss einer neuangesiedelten Hauskaninchenpopulation besprochen. Istraživanje biljnog pokrova otoka Bobare i Mrkana (Dubrovački arhipelag, Hrvatska) obavljena su 1978. i 1979. godine. Zabilježeno je 7 biljnih zajednica: Phagnalo-Centaureetum ragusinae, Asplenio-Umbilicetum horizontalis, Limonietum anfracti, Lavateretum ruderale, Narcisso-Asphodeletum microcarpi, Erico-Calicotometum villosae i Orno-Quercetum ilicis. Vegetacija otoka izložena je jakoj posoliti, te utjecaju stoke i kolonije galeba. To je uvjetovalo razvitak halofilne subasocijacije (Phagnalo-Centaureetum* ragusinae limonietosum anfracti) i nitrofilnih subasocijacija (Limonietum anfracti lavateretosum arboreae, Narcisso-Asphodeletum microcarpi sisymbrietosum officinalis i Erico-Calicotometum villosae carduetosum nutantis). U jesen 1978. unesen je na otok Bobaru domaći kunić. Istovremeno s povećanjem populacije kunića zapažene su neke promjene u vegetaciji. Potisnute su vrste kojima se kunići hrane (Lavatera arborea, Festuca arundinacea, Poa annua, Sisymbrium officinale, Hordeum leporinum i dr.), dok su se proširile vrste koje kunići izbjegavaju (Narcissus tazetta, Helichrysum italicum, Allium ampeloprasum, Asphodelus microcarpus, Euphorbia pinea i dr.). U proljeće 1982. populacija kunića se smanjila lovom i dolaskom njihovog prirodnog neprijatelja (sova ušara), nakon čega se vegetacija djelomično obnovila. The {{investigations}} of the plant cover of the islands of Bobara and Mrkan (Dubrovnik archipelago, Croatia) were carried out in 1978 and 1979. Seven plant communities have been recorded: Phagnalo-Centaureetum ragusinae, Asplenio-Umbilicetum horizontalis, Limonietum anfracti, Lavateretum rudprale, Narcisso-Asphodeletum microcarpi, Erico-Calico- tometum villosae and Orno-Quercetum ilicis. The vegetation of the islands is exposed to a strong <b>sprinkling</b> <b>with</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> influenced by the colony of sea-gulls and cattle. This has ¡resulted {{in the development of}} halophile (Phagnalo-Centaureetum ragusinae limo- nietosum anfracti) and nitrophile subassociations (Limonietum anfracti lavateretosum arboreae, Narcisso-Asphodeletum microcarpi sisymbrieto- sum officinale and Erico-Calicotometum villosae carduetosum nutantis). In the autumn of 1978 domestic rabbits were introducted to the island of Bobara. Simultaneosly with the increase of the rabbit population some changes in the vegetation were noticed. The species which rabbits eat (Lavatera arborea, Festuca arundinacea, Poa annua, Sisymbrium officinale, Hordeum leporinum etc.) were repressed while the species they avoid (Narcissus tazetta, Helichrysum italicum, Allium ampeloprasum, Asphodelus microcarpus, Euphorbia pinea etc.) spread. In the spring of 1982 the rabbit population was reduced because of hunting and the rabbits’ natural enemy, the horned owl. This has resulted in partial regeneration of the vegetation...|$|R
50|$|Masaya {{boasts a}} varied culinary {{tradition}} based on pre-Columbian recipes. However, {{the most famous}} Masayan dishes are Nacatamal, Vaho, and yucca. Nacatamal, is a giant tamal so it's a full meal on its own right. Nacatamals are made of corn flour <b>sprinkled</b> <b>with</b> annato <b>and</b> <b>salt,</b> <b>and</b> mixed <b>with</b> pork, bacon, a bit of rice, potato slices, onions, tomatoes, green peppers, mint, Congo chilis, and prunes. Then everything is covered in plantain leaves, tied up with ropes, and boiled {{for a couple of}} hours on a giant pot. Due to their large size, Nacatamals are normally eaten at breakfast or supper with a loaf of bread and black coffee to help with digestion. Now, Vaho is another heavy, hearty meal. So it is normally eaten at lunch to allow for digestion the rest of the day. It consists of thick, long slices of cecina (salted, dried beef) marinated in sour orange juice. Then, the cecina is mixed with yucca, green plantains, ripe plantains, tomatoes, onions, garlic, cabbage, and placed on a pot with the interior walls covered in plantain leaves. Then, everything's cover up with the same leaves and a lid, and steam-cooked very slowly. Vaho is eaten with a side of big, thick Nicaraguan tortillas, and a light natural fruit drink like linaza, chía, or maracuyá. Yucca is a tuber with brown, scaly skin and a pure white flesh. It can be boiled, steamed, fried, or broiled and used for different dishes like Vigorón which is boiled yucca, topped with sweet-and-sour Nicaraguan salad made of cabbage cut into strips, diced tomatoes, onions, green currants, Congo chilis, vinegar, <b>and</b> <b>salt.</b>|$|R

These two aforementioned practices are sometimes accompanied by special prayers or incantations. After, the leader begins to speak out invocations/prayers that are said to activate the spirit. The followers generally speak along with them, thus affirming the potential for realizing one's own spirit, and thus unifying them with the kami around them. The above exercises are done so participants raise their metabolism and some groups accompany this with deep breathing. They may be <b>sprinkled</b> <b>with</b> purifying <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> may be given sake to spit into the waterfall in three mouthfuls. Sometimes the participants are given salt to throw into the waterfall as they enter.
