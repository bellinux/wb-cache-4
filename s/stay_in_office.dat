5|$|A {{survey of}} American adults {{conducted}} by YouGov in September 2015 found that 56% supported Judge Bunning's decision to jail Davis for contempt of court, while 31% of Americans opposed the decision. When asked what Davis should do, 65% said that Davis should resign from office; 23% said that Davis should <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> {{and continue to}} refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples; and 4% said that Davis should remain in office but issue licenses to all persons legally entitled to one.|$|E
5|$|In February 1974, the British Prime Minister, Edward Heath, {{advised the}} Queen {{to call a}} general {{election}} {{in the middle of}} her tour of the Austronesian Pacific Rim, requiring her to fly back to Britain. The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party, but could <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> if they formed a coalition with the Liberals. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold Wilson, to form a government.|$|E
5|$|With the {{pressure}} on the Diệm regime increasing during the Buddhist crisis, Nhu and Diệm began to shun their cabinet members because they presented arguments contrary to the thinking of the Ngô family. Many ministers attempted to resign, but Thơ was credited with persuading them to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> Finding the situation increasingly intolerable, Thơ also considered resigning but the dissident generals urged him to remain. They were worried that mass resignations would arouse suspicion of a coup plot.|$|E

5|$|Bill C-19 (previously Bill S-4) titled An Act {{to amend}} the Constitution Act, 1867 (Senate tenure) was a bill to limit new Senators' tenure to eight-year terms. Currently, {{senators}} can <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> until they reach the age of 75. The bill was first introduced {{by the government in}} the Senate on May 30, 2006. After consideration in committee and making amendments to the bill, the Senate recommended that the bill not be proceeded with until such time as the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled with respect to its constitutionality, which had not occurred prior to dissolution. The bill was reintroduced in the second session as a Commons bill on November 13, 2007, but did not become law before the session ended.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen people, {{including}} Taylor, {{were eventually}} indicted in {{the assassination of}} Governor Goebel. Three accepted immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony. Only five ever went to trial, two of those being acquitted. Convictions were handed down against Taylor's Secretary of State Caleb Powers, Henry Youtsey, and Jim Howard. The prosecution charged that Powers was the mastermind, having a political opponent killed so that his boss, Governor Taylor, could <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> Youtsey was an alleged intermediary, and Howard, who {{was said to have}} been in Frankfort to seek a pardon from Taylor for the killing of a man in a family feud, was accused of being the actual assassin.|$|E
5|$|Though Nixon {{lost much}} popular support, even {{from his own}} party, he {{rejected}} accusations of wrongdoing and vowed to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> He insisted {{that he had made}} mistakes, but had no prior knowledge of the burglary, did not break any laws, and did not learn of the cover-up until early 1973. On October 10, 1973, Vice President Agnew resigned —unrelated to Watergate— and was convicted on charges of bribery, tax evasion and money laundering during his tenure as Governor of Maryland. Nixon chose Gerald Ford, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, to replace Agnew. One researcher suggested Nixon effectively disengaged from his own administration after the swearing in of Gerald Ford as Vice President on December 6, 1973.|$|E

25|$|In July 2005, President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi asked current PM Silvio Berlusconi {{about the}} {{opportunity}} for an early election {{for the first half}} of April 2006, in order to prevent a big political deadlock (the mandate of President Ciampi himself would be over in May 2006 and a newly elected government was not likely be in office within three weeks). Berlusconi however refused the deal, claiming he would <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> until the due date of his term.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipal}} assembly (Gemeindeversammlung) is the law-making body (legislature). The executive authority is the municipal council (Gemeinderat).

25|$|In the 1997 general {{election}} Fianna Fáil's campaign centred on Ahern's personal popularity. At the election, while Fianna Fáil picked up seats, its preferred coalition partner, the Progressive Democrats, {{lost more than}} half their seats. However, Labour suffered even heavier losses, leaving Fine Gael short of the support it needed to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> Ahern quickly formed a coalition government with the Progressive Democrats, {{with the support of}} four Independent TDs. On 26 June 1997, aged 45, Ahern became the youngest ever Taoiseach.|$|E
25|$|The Kingdom of Italy was {{theoretically}} {{a constitutional}} monarchy. Executive power {{belonged to the}} monarch, as executed through appointed ministers. Two chambers of parliament restricted the monarch's power—an appointive Senate and an elective Chamber of Deputies. The kingdom's constitution was the Statuto Albertino, the former governing document of the Kingdom of Sardinia. In theory, ministers were solely responsible to the king. However, in practice {{it was impossible for}} an Italian government to <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> without the support of Parliament.|$|E
25|$|In {{representative}} democracies, it may {{not benefit}} incumbents to conduct fair elections. A study showed that incumbents who rig elections <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> 2.5 times as long as those who permit fair elections. Democracies in countries with high per capita income {{have been found to}} be less prone to violence, but in countries with low incomes the tendency is the reverse. Election misconduct is more likely in countries with low per capita incomes, small populations, rich in natural resources, and a lack of institutional checks and balances. Sub-Saharan countries, as well as Afghanistan, all tend to fall into that category.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, Kweisi Mfume {{was elected}} to the Baltimore City Council, serving there until 1986. His {{political}} stance was against that of then-mayor William Donald Schaefer, who Mfume believed had ignored the many poor neighborhoods of the city. It was a contentious matter, but despite his strong opinions he learned the art of political compromise. He was perceived by many to have had some success during his <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> a fact perhaps reflected by his subsequent election to the United States House of Representatives in 1986 despite a torrent of criticism, directed in no small part against his early past.|$|E
25|$|Though {{cautiously}} {{watched by}} the international community, the coup came to be generally accepted, with the military junta organizing elections within a promised two-year timeline. In a referendum on 26 June 2006, Mauritanians overwhelmingly (97%) approved a new constitution which limited the duration of a president's <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> The leader of the junta, Col. Vall, promised {{to abide by the}} referendum and relinquish power peacefully. Mauritania's establishment of relations with Israelit is one of only three Arab states to recognize Israelwas maintained by the new regime, despite widespread criticism from the opposition. They considered that position as a legacy of the Taya regime's attempts to curry favor with the West.|$|E
25|$|Sanyal became {{widely known}} in zoological circles {{on account of}} his work and publications. He {{travelled}} to Yangon (then Rangoon) to plan the zoo facilities there. In June 1902 Sanyal was finally made a member of the honorary committee. Failing health caused Sanyal to ask for a retirement by January 1906. The replacement nominated for the post of Superintendent was also an Indian - Pasupati Mitra. However, in late 1905, Mitra was called back by his department, causing the zoo authorities to extend Sanyal's <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> by a couple of years. Sanyal continued office duties despite failing health - including hazardous and strenuous duties like working on snake antivenom, and conducting autopsies on dead animals to ascertain their cause of death.|$|E

25|$|After Aquino {{retired to}} private life {{following}} {{the end of}} her term she remained active in the Philippine political scene, constantly voicing opposition and dissent to government actions and policies, which she deemed as threats to the liberal traditions and democratic foundations of the country. In 1997, Aquino, together with Cardinal Jaime Sin, led a huge rally which succeeded in thwarting then President Fidel Ramos' attempt to extend his term by amending the 1987 Constitution's restriction on presidential term limits. In 1998, Aquino endorsed the candidacy of former police general and Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim for president. Lim, however, lost to then Vice-President Joseph Estrada, who won by a landslide. The following year, Aquino again with Cardinal Sin successfully opposed President Estrada's plan to amend the Constitution, which he said was intended to lift provisions that 'restrict' economic activities and investments; he denied that it was another ploy for him to extend his <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
25|$|Magloire {{restored}} the elite to prominence. The {{business community and}} the government benefited from favorable economic conditions until Hurricane Hazel hit the island in 1954. Haiti made some improvements on its infrastructure, {{but most of these}} were financed largely by foreign loans. By Haitian standards, Magloire's rule was firm, but not harsh: he jailed political opponents, including Fignolé, and shut down their presses when their protests grew too strident, but he allowed labor unions to function, although they were not permitted to strike. It was in the arena of corruption, however, that Magloire overstepped traditional bounds. The president controlled the sisal, cement, and soap monopolies. He and other officials built imposing mansions. The injection of international hurricane relief funds into an already corrupt system boosted graft to levels that disillusioned all Haitians. To make matters worse, Magloire followed in the footsteps of many previous presidents by disputing the termination date of his <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> Politicians, labor leaders, and their followers flocked to the streets in May 1956 to protest Magloire's failure to step down. Although Magloire declared martial law, a general strike essentially shut down Port-au-Prince. Again like many before him, Magloire fled to Jamaica, leaving the army with the task of restoring order.|$|E
500|$|The {{role of the}} pairing whip {{remained}} a crucial one as the government's slim majority turned to a minority through defeats at by-elections, and Dormand was credited with {{a central role in}} helping the government <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> [...] telling Wilson that he was too [...] "bloody knackered {{at the end of the}} day" [...] to record the events surrounding the late-night votes. In January 1978 Dormand was named in a report by the Serjeant-at-Arms as having assisted in blocking one of the Division lobbies in an attempt to prevent a vote on part of the Government's legislation to devolve power to Scotland.|$|E
