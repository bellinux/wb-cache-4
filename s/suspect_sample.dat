40|$|Researchers have {{recently}} voiced their concerns regarding bias in forensic testing. For example, fingerprint experts are brought a <b>suspect</b> <b>sample</b> {{and asked to}} confirm whether this sample matches the crime sample. Only if an expert determines a “match”, the same prints are sent to another expert to verify the match. So, if an examiner is asked to perform a verification evaluation, they know that another examiner already said that they match. This knowledge creates an expectation that the prints will match and biases the second examiner’s evaluation. We used fingerprint materials to test how much participants were biased to agree with a false previous participant’s decision planted in the experiment room. The previous participants’ judgment acted {{as a form of}} contextual information, similar to the experience by fingerprint expert, which can lead to biases. In this study, there was no significant effect of the planted match decision on the final match decision that participants made. However, confidence means were significantly higher when participants saw the prior participant’s sheet and made a decision consistent with the expectation created by the sheet. So, experts may express more confidence to authorities when confirming another individual’s decision, which may affect investigations...|$|E
40|$|Noninvasive medical {{procedures}} are usually preferable to their invasive {{counterparts in the}} medical community. Anemia examining through the palpebral conjunctiva is a convenient noninvasive procedure. The procedure can be automated to reduce the medical cost. We propose an anemia examining approach by using a Kalman filter (KF) and a regression method. The traditional KF is often used in time-dependent applications. Here, we modified the traditional KF for the time-independent data in medical applications. We simply compute the mean value of the red component of the palpebral conjunctiva image as our recognition feature and use a penalty regression algorithm to find a nonlinear curve that best fits the data of feature values and the corresponding levels of hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. To evaluate the proposed approach and several relevant approaches, we propose a risk evaluation scheme, where the entire Hb spectrum is divided into high-risk, low-risk, and doubtful intervals for anemia. The doubtful interval contains the Hb threshold, say 11 [*]g/dL, separating anemia and nonanemia. A <b>suspect</b> <b>sample</b> is the sample falling in the doubtful interval. For the anemia screening purpose, {{we would like to}} have as less suspect samples as possible. The experimental results show that the modified KF reduces the number of suspect samples significantly for all the approaches considered here...|$|E
40|$|Among {{all classes}} of drugs, the type 5 {{phosphodiesterase}} inhibitors (PDE 5 -i) (sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil) {{are the most}} counterfeited and copied in industrialized countries. This {{is why it is}} very important for regulatory agencies to have a panel of analytical methods to analyse these drugs {{and to be able to}} detect counterfeit or substandard medicines. During this chapter, several analytical techniques will be described and discussed. Among spectroscopic techniques, Raman, NIR, FT-IR and chemical imaging techniques will be envisaged. Their ability to detect counterfeits and predict if a new sample is genuine or not will be presented. Other techniques such as XRay powder diffraction and NMR spectroscopies will be briefly presented. Chromatographic impurity fingerprints will be considered and described for the analysis of suspect samples of Cialis® and Viagra®.

40|$|Artificial oxygen {{carriers}} (AOCs) can be abused by the athletes {{to improve their}} aerobic capacity. The AOCs produce a performance enhancing effect, especially in endurance sports. This article presents a method for the rapid screening of hemoglobin-based {{oxygen carriers}} (HBOCs) in blood samples. Common screening tests to reveal HBOC misuse by athletes are based on colorimetric detection since HBOC use causes discoloration of the plasma. In this communication we are presenting a different approach for HBOC detection using an hematological analyzer capable of measuring hemoglobin by two methods: a standard cyanmethemoglobin colorimetric method to calculate the amount of total hemoglobin (HGBtot) and a flow cytometric optical method to calculate the amount of hemoglobin within the red blood cells (HGBcell). Thanks to this dual contemporary hemoglobin measurement, the HGBdelta value (corresponding to free HGB) is automatically calculated by subtraction of HGBcell from HGBtot {{and can be used}} as a fast screening index of HBOC abuse. We tested the effectiveness of this approach using 68 normal blood samples with different basal HGB values fortified with three different HBOCs at varying concentrations. We evaluated the performance of the method by calculating the correlation between HGBcell and HGBtot values in normal samples. Finally we used a simple statistical approach to calculate a reliable HGBdelta cut-off value (0. 35 g/dL) as a limit of decision to discriminate between a clear negative sample and a <b>suspect</b> <b>sample</b> to submit to a confirmation analysis.

40|$|Soils are {{frequently}} analysed by forensic laboratories by comparing a <b>suspect</b> <b>sample</b> to an especially collected control sample. As yet, they cannot {{be compared to}} a central database, unless the area in question has already been identified; with the use databases being highly contested {{within the field of}} forensic geosciences. There is a need for a method of soil profiling that allows an unknown sample to be tested and assigned a quantitative likelihood that it originated from a given region. Spatial models can then be created using geographical information systems to house multiple datasets and be used to map soils across geographical areas. Generally, the more variables available with which to compare items, the greater the certainty a forensic analyst can have when asserting their similarity; this applies to geological materials. Equally, soil profiling methods can be used to exclude soil samples from each other or an area. This research involves a number of chemical and biological profiling methods that have been used to build up a unique signature for soils from different locations across Norfolk. All analyses have been carried out on a single source sample. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios have been measured using MC-ICP-MS, and trace element concentrations measured using ICP-MS. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios are significantly different at each of the sample locations; although there is some variation in the replicates collected at each location this variation is smaller than the regional variation. The correlation between the isotope chemistry of the topsoil and the underlying geology is poor, indicating that other sources such as land-use, vegetation cover and additions to the soil contribute to the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr. Therefore, trace element concentrations have been used to spatially discriminate samples and to investigate the effect of fertilisers on the elemental composition of the topsoil. The biological techniques used to aid discrimination are soil DNA analysis using the chloroplast-located matK gene and MALDI-ToF-MS, palynology and the creation of Norfolk vegetation maps showing all of the plant species recorded in the area; each additional independent dataset allows for an increasing signature of each sample to be built up which can be used for assessing similarity or exclusionary purposes...|$|E

40|$|Among {{the several}} {{algorithms}} that exist for Iris pattern recognition, Daugman’s innovation {{is one of}} the most implemented approaches. His algorithm is based on Near-InfraRed (NIR) images which have been proven as an effective technique particularly when used in controlled scenarios [1]. The trend of using gray NIR-base images then dominates the process of Iris recognition and influences the majority of eyes’ images databases. The aim of this paper is to create a model that achieves a more effective Iris-recognition system (i. e.

In the present study, a total of 1734 raw milk samples were collected, and qualitatively screened with two different tests, the Delvotest SP assay and an enzyme-linked receptor-binding assay (SNAP). Overall, 106 (6. 11 %) out of 1734 samples examined with Delvotest SP contained possible drug residues (5. 12 % and 7. 51 % of samples from 2009 and 2010, respectively).
