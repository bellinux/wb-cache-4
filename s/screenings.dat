WE EXAMINED 1. 854 CHILDREN AGED 3 - 6 YEARS ATTENDING 32 PUBLIC NURSERIES LOCATED IN CENTRAL ATHENS. KNOWING THAT THE TEST ASCERTAINS CHILDREN WITH SCORE 12 AS HAVING A DEVIATED BEHAVIOUR, THE OVERALL PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN IN THIS CATEGORY WAS FOUND TO BE 17 % (312 CHILDREN). A WIDE RANGE (5 % TO 40 %) IN THE INCIDENCE OF THE PROBLEM WAS OBSERVED AMONG THE NURSERIES. YOUNGER CHILDREN, PARTICULARLY BOYS, WERE MORE LIKELY TO PRESENT BEHAVIOURAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS DIFFICULTY TO BE MANAGED, INTERFERING, DISTRUCTIVENESS AND OVERACTIVITY. LOOKING FOR THE POSSIBLE UNDERLYING RELATED FACTORS AS WELL AS THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF THE <b>SCREENING</b> TEST USED, 36 CHILDREN HAVING A SCORE > 12, RANDOMLY SELECTED, WERE ASSESSED DEVELOPMENTALLY.
