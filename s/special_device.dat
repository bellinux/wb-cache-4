5|$|Completely unskilled at combat, Quark {{stands to}} either lose Grilka or be killed. Worf again helps the Ferengi; using a <b>special</b> <b>device</b> {{implemented}} by Dax, Worf {{is able to}} control Quark's body movements from an adjacent holosuite and help Quark defend himself with a bat'leth. Although the device temporarily malfunctions, he ultimately defeats the bodyguard. The scene concludes with Grilka and Quark alone and enamored with one another. Worf opines to Jadzia that Quark is unworthy of such a great Klingon woman, and she counters that Worf's interest in Grilka is superficial, asserting that there are better options awaiting him. Observing that Worf still fails to see the subtext in her hints, Dax initiates an aggressive romantic encounter. In the next scene, both couples are shown in the infirmary; Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) treats their wounds and quickly deduces {{the source of their}} injuries.|$|E
5|$|For {{stationary}} shots where Superman is seen flying toward or {{away from}} the camera, blue screen matte techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a <b>special</b> <b>device</b> made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be 'inserted' into a matted area of a background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would {{give the appearance of}} flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. The disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the matted image—in this case, Superman—do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.|$|E
5|$|Shekhar Subramanium (Shah Rukh Khan), a game {{designer}} who also works at Barron Industries, has delivered {{a number of}} commercial failures; an irate Barron (Dalip Tahil) gives him his last chance to develop a successful game. To impress his sceptical son Prateek (Armaan Verma), and upon the request of his wife Sonia (Kareena Kapoor), Shekhar uses his son's idea that the antagonist should be {{more powerful than the}} protagonist. His colleague, computer programmer Jenny uses Shekhar's face as a model for that of the game's protagonist G.One (Shah Rukh Khan) (Technically Good One and in Hindi Jeevan, which means life), while the shape-shifting antagonist Ra.One (Technically Random Access Version One and in Hindi Ravan, a mythical demon) is made faceless. Another colleague, her boyfriend Akashi (Tom Wu), implements the characters' movements. The game, named Ra.One, contains three levels, the final level being the only one in which either character can be killed. Each character possesses a <b>special</b> <b>device</b> – the H.A.R.T (Hertz Amplifying Resonance Transmitter) which gives them their powers. Upon reaching the last level, the characters gain a gun with one bullet; the other character can be killed by this bullet but only if his H.A.R.T is attached.|$|E

25|$|To allow {{protection}} from the inherent risks of fighting fires, firefighters wear and carry protective and self-rescue equipment at all times. A self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) delivers air to the firefighter through a full face mask and is worn to protect against smoke inhalation, toxic fumes, and super heated gases. A <b>special</b> <b>device</b> called a Personal Alert Safety System (PASS) is commonly worn independently or {{as a part of}} the SCBA to alert others when a firefighter stops moving for a specified period of time or manually operates the device. The PASS device sounds an alarm that can assist another firefighter (firefighter assist and search team (FAST), or rapid intervention team (RIT), in locating the firefighter in distress.|$|E

500|$|... was {{developed}} so that players could freely navigate Ages rendered in realtime, {{which meant that}} the traditional digital insertion of characters into the setting would be infeasible. The models of End of Agess characters were instead computer-generated. A <b>special</b> <b>device</b> was created that captured video of the actor's faces while they spoke their lines, as Cyan {{did not want to}} lose the warmth and feeling provided by using a live actor. The video was then manipulated and used as a facial texture that was mapped onto the 3D characters. Motion capture was also used to ensure lifelike movement. Cyan staff were worried that the audio syncing for animation would not be finished in time for the E3 unveiling of the game, but were happy with the end results.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the events}} in Smoking Mirror a few years ago, George Stobbart has {{returned}} to {{his life as a}} lawyer, and finds himself flying to the Congo Basin, alongside his pilot, Harry Gilligan, to meet a scientist by the name of Cholmondely, who claims to have created a machine that can make limitless energy. [...] However, a storm forces the pair's plane to crash land on a cliff-top, right close to the scientist's lab. [...] Escaping the wreckage, George makes his way to the lab, arriving {{just in time to see}} the scientist gunned down by a pale, lanky man, known as Susarro, and his bodyguard, after being questioned on an unknown subject. [...] A postcard hidden in the lab prompts George to travel to Glastonbury, England, to search for a man named Bruno, and a friend of the scientist, who had advised him to flee. In his attempts to find out where Bruno is, he quickly learns that he disappeared before his arrival and is now in danger. Although not knowing where he is exactly, after visiting a fortune teller, George spots a building that caught fire, and goes to deal with it, saving an old man trapped within it. [...] When they chat, he quickly learns that the old man's name is Bruno Ostvald, the scientist he met in the Hotel Ubu in Paris, and a Neo-Templar. [...] Bruno reveals to George that he left the group after the events of Shadows of the Templar, and that they are now led by Susarro, who took over and renamed it the Cult of the Dragon. Susarro is seeking to gain immortality through the use of the Earth’s ley lines, which Cholmondely was using in his experiments, and Bruno explains that he is able to track these with a <b>special</b> <b>device</b> he has, believing Susarro may be going to a site in Paris to find something important, prompting the pair to follow after him.|$|E

2500|$|When Emily had left, Bagpuss woke up.

The wooden woodpecker bookend became the drily academic Professor Yaffle (based on the philosopher Bertrand Russell, whom Postgate had once met), while the mice carved {{on the side of the}} [...] "mouse organ" [...] (a small mechanical pipe organ that played rolls of music) woke up and scurried around, singing in high-pitched voices. Sandra Kerr and John Faulkner provided the voices of Madeleine and Gabriel respectively, and put together and performed all the folk songs. All the other voices (including the narrator and one out-of-tune mouse) were provided by Postgate, who also wrote the stories.|$|E
2500|$|Fitness-for-use (FFU) test; AKA, control sample: [...] {{since an}} EDD {{may fail to}} detect {{indentations}} when they are actually present (for a variety of reasons), {{it is important to}} check on the equipment's performance using a control sample (commonly called a FFU test) known to have indentations. [...] Recommendations include using a FFU test sample {{at the beginning and end}} of a series involving the examination of multiple questioned documents, or placing a small FFU test sample adjacent to each questioned document on the platen. [...] The FFU test can be prepared by hand using a similar writing instrument and similar paper. [...] Alternatively, a <b>special</b> <b>device</b> call the 'Gradient®' can be used to produce control indentations that vary in depth in a known manner thereby permitting the examiner to determine not only that the EDD is working but also the degree to which it is sensitive. It is not essential to precisely match the questioned document in terms of paper type or pen type since the objective is to show that the device is functioning properly.|$|E

60|$|This dance {{had been}} the <b>special</b> <b>device</b> of Monsieur and the ballet-master, and {{during the last three}} days the houris had been almost danced off their legs with rehearsing it morning, noon, and night, but one at least of them was {{scarcely}} in a condition for its performance. Eustacie, dizzied at the first minute by the whirl of her Elysian merry-go-round, had immediately after become conscious of that which she had been too childish to estimate merely in prospect, the exposure to universal gaze. Strange staring eyes, glaring lights, frightful imps seemed to wheel round her in an intolerable delirious succession. Her only refuge was in closing her eyes, but even this could not long be persevered in, so necessary a part of the pageant was she; and besides, she had Berenger to look for, Berenger, whom she had foolishly laughed at for knowing how dreadful it would be. But of course the endeavour to seek for one object with her eyes made the dizziness even more dreadful; and when, at length, she beheld him dragged down by the demoniacal creatures, whose horrors were magnified by her confused senses, and the next moment she was twirled out of sight, her cry of distracted alarm was irrepressible. Carried round again and again, on a wheel that to her was far more like Ixion's than that of the spheres, she never cleared her perceptions as to where he was, and only was half-maddened by the fantastic whirl of incongruous imagery, while she barely sat out Mercury's lengthy harangue; and when her wheel stood still, and she was released, she could not stand, and was indebted to Charon and one of her fellow-nymphs for supporting her to a chair {{in the back of the}} scene. Kind Charon hurried to bring her wine, the lady revived her with essences, and the ballet-master clamoured for his performers.|$|E
