A control system is needed to handle the parameter negotiation and service initiation between the client and the server system. The stream based service is adapted to different access networks via the control system's parameter negotiation procedure. The stream application may also dynamically change the service parameters like bandwidth. In addition, the control system allows us to separate the service control entity from the entities involved in the service contents (e. g. playing a media stream) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} formal Modeling and Simulation (M&S) {{methodology}} for hybrid <b>control</b> of networking <b>systems.</b> The method {{is used for}} analysis, design and implementation of Quality of <b>Service</b> (QoS) <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> in Network Processor (NP) -based applications. We apply continuous <b>Control</b> <b>Systems</b> Theory to enforce Admission Control strategies into discrete–event network traffic. This represents a hybrid system modeling problem, {{that has to be}} treated formally to guarantee the applicability of the continuous control theoretical results into discrete– event systems. We show that using DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification), in combination with Quantized State Systems (QSS) numerical methods for the approximation of continuous systems, offers numerous advantages: these frameworks provide the means to accurately analyze and design hybrid models for Admission Control and they can be seamlessly integrated into a unified formal framework. It also enables the transition between the DEVS–based simulation and the deployment of the obtained hybrid models into the target networking platform...|$|R
