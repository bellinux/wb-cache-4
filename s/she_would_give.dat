5|$|Manning's {{father took}} a job as an {{information}} technology (IT) manager for a rental car agency, which required travel. The family lived several miles out of town, and Manning's mother was unable to drive. She spent her days drinking, while Manning was left largely to fend for herself, playing with Legos or on the computer. Brian would stock up on food before his trips, and leave pre-signed checks that Casey mailed to pay the bills. A neighbor said that whenever Manning's elementary school went on field trips, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> her own son extra food or money so he could make sure Manning had something to eat. Friends and neighbors considered the Mannings a troubled family.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Katherine's words, {{the view}} {{had been for}} Rowe {{to act as a}} {{surrogate}} mother; <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> the baby to Jackson as a friendly favor and he would raise it. Jackson intended to issue a statement following the birth that the identity of the mother was a secret, {{in the same way that}} the identities of many surrogates are protected. Katherine's involvement, however, influenced Jackson to call Rowe and ask her to meet him in Australia, where he was staying, as soon as she could. There, the entertainer announced his plans for them to wed the next day.|$|E
5|$|Chris angrily demands Leslie {{bring the}} {{painting}} to city hall {{the next day to}} be destroyed. When Leslie reluctantly agrees to do so, Jerry expresses disappointment that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> up so easily. Feeling empowered again, Leslie asks Jerry to quickly paint another, similar painting, only this time with Tom as the centaur. Leslie tells Marcia the new painting is the original one but painted over. With no more nudity in the painting, a frustrated Marcia gives up her quest to have the painting destroyed. Tom is delighted with the painting until he realizes that Jerry forgot to draw a penis on the centaur. Ben later confides to Andy he likes Leslie but is unable to ask her out because of Chris, but Andy tells him if they truly care about each other, then it will eventually happen.|$|E

5|$|Maria made an {{agreement}} with her sister, Bronisława, that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> her financial assistance during Bronisława's medical studies in Paris, in exchange for similar assistance two years later. In connection with this, Maria took a position as governess: first as a home tutor in Warsaw; then for two years as a governess in Szczuki with a landed family, the Żorawskis, who were relatives of her father. While working for the latter family, {{she fell in love}} with their son, Kazimierz Żorawski, a future eminent mathematician. His parents rejected the idea of his marrying the penniless relative, and Kazimierz was unable to oppose them. Maria's loss of the relationship with Żorawski was tragic for both. He soon earned a doctorate and pursued an academic career as a mathematician, becoming a professor and rector of Kraków University. Still, as an old man and a mathematics professor at the Warsaw Polytechnic, he would sit contemplatively before the statue of Maria Skłodowska which had been erected in 1935 before the Radium Institute that she had founded in 1932.|$|E
25|$|She {{should have}} made her vows three months after {{entering}} the convent, but her family demanded a six-month delay {{in the hope that}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> up her project during this period.|$|E
25|$|Bennett {{had decided}} to pursue gynaecology, not wanting {{to walk in the}} limelight of her family. However, Bennett's grandfather, Tim Lee, saw that the American Idol auditions were being held in Greensboro, and Bennett agreed to try out but said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> up singing if she did not make it, as stated on the show.|$|E
60|$|Moreover, Lillie's {{face had}} a beauty this winter {{it had never}} worn: the {{softness}} of a real feeling, the pathos of real suffering, at times touched her face with something that was always wanting in it before. The bitter waters of sin that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> drink <b>gave</b> a strange feverish color to her cheek; and the poisoned perfume <b>she</b> <b>would</b> inhale <b>gave</b> a strange new brightness to her eyes.|$|R
25|$|After {{all these}} things were conducted, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be <b>given</b> an ancestral name, and the naming {{ceremony}} or potlatch would occur.|$|R
60|$|The {{words were}} hardly {{out of her}} mouth before <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>given</b> {{everything}} <b>she</b> possessed in the world to recall them.|$|R
25|$|Morissette is {{a regular}} on ABS-CBN's Sunday {{afternoon}} show, ASAP, {{as one of the}} Birit Queens. Other members of this group include Angeline Quinto, Klarisse de Guzman, and Jonalyn Viray. There were speculations that the individual members of the group tried to outshine each other. Amon stated in an interview that ASAP assigned them songs to sing and that the group worked together for the various song numbers. She further clarified that when it was her turn <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> her all, but during the time the group merged voices they should blend together.|$|E
25|$|She {{participated in}} a war bond selling {{campaign}} with a sailor named Eddie Rhodes. Rhodes was in the crowd at each Lamarr appearance, and she would call him up on stage. She would briefly flirt with him before asking the audience if she should give him a kiss. The crowd would of course say yes, to which Hedy would reply that she would if enough people bought war bonds. After enough bonds were purchased, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> Rhodes his kiss, and he would head back into the audience. Then they would head off to the next war bond rally.|$|E
25|$|By 1977, Rose's {{father had}} come to {{tolerate}} his daughter's marriage, {{and to develop a}} grudging respect for Fred. Together, he and Fred opened a café they named The Green Lantern, which was soon bankrupt. Reportedly, when Bill Letts discovered Rose's prostitution, he would also visit their home to engage in sex with his daughter. By 1983, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> birth to eight children, at least three of whom were conceived by clients to whom she prostituted herself. Fred willingly accepted these children as his own, and would falsely inform them the reason their skin was darker than that of their siblings was because his own great-grandmother was a black woman.|$|E
60|$|Emily blushed, and {{endeavored}} {{to laugh at}} her own absence of mind; but <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>given</b> {{the world to know}} who Marian was.|$|R

25|$|In 2008, Heap {{was asked}} to perform at POP!Tech in Camden, Maine (US). There she {{performed}} selections from her then forthcoming album Ellipse. After her set and an encouraging plea for another performance later in the conference by the audience and organisers, Heap agreed. Having nothing else prepared though, she decided to improvise a song on the spot with parameters (tempo, key) suggested by the audience. After the show, Heap was asked by a Poptech attendee if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> the newly created piece of music to his charity. A ‘lightbulb’ moment occurred in Heap’s head and she saw the potential in doing these improvised pieces for local charities at each show during the tour she would soon begin.|$|E
25|$|For {{four years}} she {{traveled}} {{with the troops}} through war-torn Virginia. As {{the wife of a}} colonel she had access to supply wagons and luggage meant for the officers and would often steal supplies in order to care for the soldiers. This sparked a controversy that President Abraham Lincoln eventually settled; the President also pinned a captain's star on her at the time. In January 1863 the troops were ordered to go to Aquia Creek, Virginia, and of course Agnes followed her husband. Here she made a bet that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> President Lincoln three kisses within the next few days on his visit to the camp, and she succeeded in doing so.|$|E
25|$|In the {{tympanum}} {{there are}} {{scenes from the}} birth of Christ: from the left to right: the Annunciation (of the angel indicating to Maria that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> birth); the Nativity (the birth of the Christ child); and the Epiphany (the adoration of the magi). Two angels hold the arms of Portugal, close to the archivolt. The splays {{on each side of}} the portal are filled with statues, among them are statues of King Manuel I and Queen Maria of Aragón kneeling in a niche under a lavishly decorated baldachin, flanked by their patrons: Saint Jerome and Saint John the Baptist, respectively. The supporting corbels are decorated with little angels holding the coat-of-arms and, at the side of the king, an armillary sphere and, at the side of the queen, three blooming twigs. Renaissance elements include angels in Roman garb, cherubs, the detail and realism of the kings and the nude study of Saint Jerome.|$|E

25|$|The {{internal}} {{matters of}} the palace were in her charge. But {{she did not want}} to hurt anyone's feelings in the least, did not interfere in the matters, sought justice and equity, and because she was firmly religious she passed a good deal of time in prayers. She possessed good, high moral standards, which led her to help the poor and needy. When anyone went to see her, they would enter her presence in the same way they did the Sultan's, then take a seat in front of her. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> them advice and treat them kindly. Perestu had a house in Maçka that Sultan Abdülaziz had presented to her at one time. Nowadays this villa is a school. Three days before Abdul Hamid became Sultan, he went to this villa, and it was from there that he proceeded to Topkapı Palace for the ceremony of homage at his accession. Abdul Hamid presented this villa of Perestu along with all its furniture and household goods to Ahmed Riza Bey, the speaker of Parliament.|$|E
500|$|Dunstan {{was born}} in Baltonsborough, Somerset. He {{was the son of}} Heorstan, a noble of Wessex. Heorstan was the brother of Athelm the bishop of Wells and of the Bishop of Winchester. It is {{recorded}} that his mother, Cynethryth, was a pious woman. Osbern's life of Dunstan relates that a messenger miraculously told her of the saintly child <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> birth to: ...|$|E
500|$|Legends {{incorrectly}} {{say that}} she was Jelena Obilić, a widow of Miloš Obilić. One of the legends about Jelena was recorded in Herzegovina. According to that legend Sandalj asked Jelena who was her favorite husband. Her reply was that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> away both Sandalj and Balšić just to see Miloš Obilić one more time. Sandalj was angered and Jelena had to run away from him. While she was on the way to Zeta, in some nettle, she gave birth to a boy who was a founder of Koprivica family (kopriva, [...] "nettle").|$|E

500|$|The Times {{refused to}} print the {{advertisement}} from the Pig-faced Lady's would-be suitor, and donated his £1 fee to The Marine Society. An anonymous letter-writer to the Times continued the comparison with Joanna Southcott, who had claimed that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> {{birth to the}} Messiah in October 1814, speculating that [...] "the present miss piggy" [...] was perhaps Southcott's child, [...] "brought into {{the world in a}} state of complete puberty". The letter-writer also ridiculed the [...] "swinish Lothario" [...] who hoped to marry the Pig-faced Lady, suggesting that [...] "if he means to have her, he must woo her in grunts".|$|E
500|$|Rachel Whiteread {{had already}} been {{notified}} of her [...] "victory" [...] but had {{refused to accept the}} prize or allow the K Foundation to use her name. The motorcade left the site of the amending of art-history and headed back to London, for a showdown with Whiteread {{on the steps of the}} Tate. When she again refused to accept the money, the K Foundation explained that it would be burnt. With the crowd of now very drunk witnesses looking on, a masked K Foundation operative (Gimpo) fumbled with matches and lighter fluid. At the last moment Rachel Whiteread emerged from the Tate and accepted the money, stating that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> it as grants to needy artists.|$|E
500|$|While {{living at}} the Chelsea Hotel, Solanas {{introduced}} herself to Maurice Girodias, the founder of Olympia Press and a fellow resident of the hotel. In August 1967, Girodias and Solanas signed an informal contract stating that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>give</b> Girodias her [...] "next writing, and other writings". In exchange, Girodias paid her $500. She took this to mean that Girodias would own her work. She told Paul Morrissey that [...] "everything I write will be his. He's done this to me... He's screwed me!" [...] Solanas intended {{to write a novel}} based on the SCUM Manifesto, and believed that a conspiracy was behind Warhol's failure to return the Up Your Ass script. She suspected that he was coordinating with Girodias to steal her work.|$|E
