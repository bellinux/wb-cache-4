500|$|A {{more recent}} {{controversy}} was the statement in a 2013 biography of Britten by Paul Kildea that the composer's heart failure {{was due to}} undetected syphilis, which Kildea speculates {{was a result of}} Pears's promiscuity while the two were living in New York. In response, Britten's consultant cardiologist said that, like all the hospital's similar cases, Britten was routinely screened for syphilis before the operation, with negative results. He described as [...] "complete rubbish" [...] Kildea's allegation that the surgeon who operated on Britten in 1973 would or even could have covered up a syphilitic condition. Kildea continued to maintain, [...] "When all the composer's symptoms are considered there can be only one cause". In The Times, Richard Morrison praised the rest of Kildea's book, and hoped that its reputation would not be [...] "tarnished by one sensational speculation... some <b>second-hand</b> <b>hearsay...</b> presenting unsubstantiated gossip as fact".|$|E

60|$|All the {{evidence}} they had produced to you amounts {{to no more}} than that such a man believes such a man heard of something; and to close the whole of this hearsay account, Sir Elijah Impey, who always comes in as a supplement, declares that no man doubted of the existence of this rebellion, and of the guilt of the Begums, any more than of the rebellion of 1745: a comparison which, I must say, is, by way of evidence, a little indecorous in a chief-justice of India. Your Lordships are sufficiently acquainted with the history of that rebellion to know, that, when Lord Lovat was tried at this bar, the proceedings against him were not founded on <b>second-hand</b> <b>hearsay.</b> The existence of the rebellion of 1745 was proved, notwithstanding its notoriety; but neither notoriety nor proof would have signified anything, if Lord Lovat's participation in it had not been brought home to him directly, personally, and particularly. Yet a chief-justice, sent to India to represent the sacred majesty of the crown of England, has {{gone so far as to}} say at your bar that no more doubt could be entertained of the existence either of the rebellion or the guilt of the Begums than of the rebellion in 1745. Besides, he forgets that he himself carried the order to confiscate these people's property without any trial whatever. But this is the way of proceeding by an English chief-justice in India,--a chief-justice who had rendered himself the instrument, the letter-carrier, the messenger, I had almost said the executioner of Mr. Hastings.|$|E
6000|$|Yes, Milton was a Puritan; one who, {{instead of}} trusting {{himself and his}} hopes of the {{universe}} to <b>second-hand</b> <b>hearsays,</b> systems, and traditions, had looked God's Word and his own soul in the face, and determined to act on that which he had found. And therefore it is that to open his works at any stray page, after these effeminate Carolists, is like falling asleep in a stifling city drawing-room, amid Rococo French furniture, not without untidy traces of last night's ball, and awaking in an Alpine valley, amid the scent of sweet cyclamens and pine boughs, {{to the music of}} trickling rivulets and shouting hunters, beneath the dark cathedral aisles of mighty trees, and here and there, above them and beyond, the spotless peaks of everlasting snow; while far beneath your feet - ...|$|R

60|$|Edward Springrove's {{answer to}} the last letter, after expressing his amazement at the strange contradiction between the verses and Mrs. Morris's letter, {{had been to the}} effect that he had again visited the {{neighbour}} of the dead Mr. Brown, and had received as near a description of Mrs. Manston as it was possible to get at <b>second-hand,</b> and by <b>hearsay.</b> She was a tall woman, wide at the shoulders, and full-chested, and she had a straight and rather large nose. The colour of her eyes the informant did not know, for she had only seen the lady in the street as she went in or out. This confusing remark was added. The woman had almost recognized Mrs. Manston when she had called with her husband lately, but she had kept her veil down. Her residence, before she came to Hoxton, was quite unknown to this next-door neighbour, and Edward could get no manner of clue to it from any other source.|$|R
