The campus of the Tuck School sits in a complex {{on the west side of}} Dartmouth's campus, near the Connecticut River. Shortly after being founded in 1900, Tuck was housed in a single building across from the Green at the center of the campus; in 1930, the institution moved into <b>Stell,</b> Chase, Tuck, and Woodbury Halls in its present location along the Tuck Mall. Today, these original structures serve as four of Tuck's six academic and administrative buildings.|$|E

Dissanayake also noted the entertaining realism, as it [...] "feels like our world, full of technologies that...will [...] very soon." [...] Comic Book Resources' Sonia Harris also praised the series for its realism, writing the [...] "metaphor of artificially intelligent beings living out their secret lives, unsafe and insecure, yet potentially stronger and smarter than humans is potent." [...] Dean <b>Stell,</b> a reviewer for Weekly Comic Book Review, said Luna and Vaughn created [...] "a wonderful and classically-themed science-fiction story."

Marta had shot close to 150 B movies for Republic Pictures by this time, which is {{probably}} why he was hired (given AB-PT's relationship with that studio and Marta's fast-and-quick shooting style). Albert Glasser composed the musical score. Glasser worked in the same office building where Gordon had his offices, and Gordon admired his score for the 1956 war film Huk! (a B movie from Pan Pacific Productions). Gordon had already used Glasser to score his 1957 monster movie The Cyclops. Glasser wrote the musical score for Beginning of the End as well as five more of Gordon's films. Glasser was paid $4,000 {{for his work on}} The Cyclops, which may indicate how much he was paid for the musical score for Beginning of the End. The musical soundtrack included the song [...] "Natural, Natural Baby." [...] The art director was Walter Keller.|$|E

6000|$|Sir Duncan, without replying, {{conducted}} the soldier into the tower; the defences {{of which were}} a portcullis and ironclenched oaken door, {{the thickness of the}} wall being the space between them. He had no sooner arrived in a hall hung with tapestry, than the Captain prosecuted his military criticism. It was indeed suspended by the sight of an excellent breakfast, of which he partook with great avidity; but no sooner had he secured this meal, than he made the tour of the apartment, examining the ground around the Castle very carefully from each window in the room. He then returned to his chair, and throwing himself back into it at his length, stretched out one manly leg, and tapping his jack-boot with the riding-rod which he carried in his hand, after the manner of a half-bred man who affects ease in the society of his betters, he delivered his unasked opinion as follows:--"This house of yours, now, Sir Duncan, is a very pretty defensible sort of a tenement, and yet it is hardly such as a cavaliero of honour would expect to maintain his credit by holding out for many days. For, Sir Duncan, if it pleases you to notice, your house is overcrowed, and slighted, or commanded, as we military men say, by yonder round hillock to the landward, whereon an enemy might <b>stell</b> such a battery of cannon as would make ye glad to beat a chamade within forty-eight hours, unless it pleased the Lord extraordinarily to show mercy." ...|$|E
