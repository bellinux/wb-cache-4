5|$|Unusually for a revolver, the Webley-Fosbery had a <b>safety</b> <b>catch,</b> and {{the light}} trigger pull, solid design, and {{reputation}} for accuracy ensured that the Webley-Fosbery remained popular with target shooters long after production had finished.|$|E
25|$|All prison-authorised M1 carbine rifles, {{including}} that seized by Ryan from Lange, were issued loaded with eight rounds ball. Seven {{of the eight}} were accounted for in Ryan's case. If the eighth fell onto {{the floor of the}} prison watch-tower when Ryan cocked the rifle with the <b>safety</b> <b>catch</b> on, thereby ejecting a live round, then the bullet that killed Hodson must have been fired by a person other than Ryan.|$|E
25|$|The Battle was {{a robust}} {{aircraft}} which was frequently {{described as being}} easy to fly, even for relatively inexperienced pilots. The pilot was provided with overall good external visibility and the cockpit {{was considered to be}} roomy and comfortable for the era; however, the task of simultaneously deploying the flaps and the retractable undercarriage, which included a <b>safety</b> <b>catch,</b> has been highlighted as posing considerable complication. Climate control within the cockpit was also reportedly a less-than-desirable state of affairs.|$|E

5000|$|Most {{pneumatic}} {{die grinder}} throttles (also called triggers) feature a spring-loaded [...] "kickstand" [...] mechanism between the throttle lever {{and the body}} of the grinder. This prevents the throttle from opening (being pressed down towards {{the body of the}} grinder) without operator intervention and inhibits accidental activation. It is similar in principle to the <b>safety</b> <b>catches</b> used on many handguns.|$|R

500|$|With Hitler's {{arrival in}} Bad Wiessee between 06:00 and 07:00, the SA leadership, still in bed, {{were taken by}} surprise. SS men stormed the hotel and Hitler {{personally}} placed Röhm and other high-ranking SA leaders under arrest. According to Erich Kempka, Hitler turned Röhm over to [...] "two detectives holding pistols with the <b>safety</b> <b>catch</b> removed", and the SS found Breslau SA leader Edmund Heines in bed with an unidentified eighteen-year-old male SA senior troop leader. Goebbels emphasised this aspect in subsequent propaganda justifying the purge as a crackdown on moral turpitude. Hitler ordered both Heines and his partner taken outside of the hotel and shot. Meanwhile, the SS arrested the other SA leaders as they left their train for the planned meeting with Röhm and Hitler.|$|E
2500|$|The Nambu pistol uses a low {{pressure}} 8mm cartridge, which is considerably less powerful than contemporary pistol cartridges like the American [...]45 ACP, the Soviet 7.62×25mm Tokarev, the British [...]455 Webley, and the German 9×19mm Parabellum. The <b>safety</b> <b>catch</b> on the Type A requires {{both hands to}} operate; it was omitted entirely from the Type 14.|$|E
2500|$|DA and DAO revolvers {{were the}} standard-issue sidearm of countless police {{departments}} for many decades. Only in the 1990s did the semiautomatic pistol {{begin to make}} serious inroads after the advent of safe actions. The reasons for these choices are the modes of carry and use. Double action is good for high-stress situations because it allows a mode of carry in which [...] "draw and pull the trigger" [...] is the only requirement—no <b>safety</b> <b>catch</b> release nor separate cocking stroke is required.|$|E

5000|$|On February 2, 2013, Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, 35, {{were shot}} and killed by Eddie Ray Routh at the Rough Creek Ranch-Lodge-Resort {{shooting}} range in Erath County, Texas. Both Kyle and Littlefield were armed with [...]45-caliber 1911-style pistols when they were killed, but neither gun had been unholstered or fired, and the <b>safety</b> <b>catches</b> were still on. Kyle was killed with a [...]45-caliber pistol, while Littlefield was shot with a 9mm SIG Sauer pistol. Both guns belonged to Kyle.|$|R
25|$|Whether in {{the main}} sweep or in an {{individual}} stop's sweep, the same tactics would be applied. The sweepline would proceed forward with each soldier scanning line of sight ahead through the bush and undergrowth. The speed of this movement varied depending on the terrain and density of the bush, but when the troops sensed enemy ahead the sweep slowed markedly, edging forward inch by inch, rifles at ready and pointed ahead with the <b>safety</b> <b>catches</b> off. MAG gunners would bear the gun at the hip, held by a sling from their shoulders.|$|R
60|$|He {{climbed on}} serenely. He {{was a most}} {{exasperating}} dog. I screamed at him and hit him with a rock big enough to break his bones. He kept on climbing. Here was a predicament. Moze would surely get to the lioness if I did not stop him, and this seemed impossible. It {{was out of the}} question for me to climb after him. And if the lioness jumped she would have to pass me or come straight at me. So I slipped down the <b>safety</b> <b>catch</b> on my automatic and stood ready to save Moze or myself.|$|E
60|$|When {{he arrived}} at the spot, Tudor was gone, and only his foot-prints remained, {{pointing}} out the course he had taken into the depths of the plantation. Once, ten minutes later, he caught a glimpse of Tudor, a hundred yards away, crossing the same avenue as himself but going in the opposite direction. His rifle half-leaped to his shoulder, but the other was gone. More in whim than in hope of result, grinning to himself as he did so, Sheldon raised his automatic pistol and in two seconds sent eight shots scattering through the trees in the direction in which Tudor had disappeared. Wishing he had a shot-gun, Sheldon dropped to the ground behind a tree, slipped a fresh clip up the hollow butt of the pistol, threw a cartridge into the chamber, shoved the <b>safety</b> <b>catch</b> into place, and reloaded the empty clip.|$|E
6000|$|And Daylight sat and {{consumed}} cocktails and saw {{back in his}} life to Alaska, and lived over the grim years {{in which he had}} battled for his eleven millions. For a while murder ate at his heart, and wild ideas and sketchy plans of killing his betrayers flashed through his mind. That was what that young man should have done instead of killing himself. He should have gone gunning. Daylight unlocked his grip and took out his automatic pistol--a big Colt's [...] .44. He released the <b>safety</b> <b>catch</b> with his thumb, and operating the sliding outer barrel, ran the contents of the clip through the mechanism. The eight cartridges slid out in a stream. He refilled the clip, threw a cartridge into the chamber, and, with the trigger at full cock, thrust up the safety ratchet. He shoved the weapon into the side pocket of his coat, ordered another Martini, and resumed his seat.|$|E

50|$|The electrical, {{instrumentation}} {{and control}} equipment of such a modern incinerator unit includes a main switch, an emergency switch as well as all necessary <b>safety</b> <b>catches,</b> contactors, relays and clamps, key switches for the start up and so on. All measuring, controlling and adjusting functions are realized in a modern mobile incineration plant. There are some safety limits which are processed by the hardware of such a plant. For start-up and operation of the mobile units, most have their own electrical generator on board for power supply. The whole equipment has to comply with European (e.g. DIN 41494, DIN 41488) and/or international (e.g. IEC Publication 297) standards.|$|R
50|$|Some {{units of}} the Swedish Police have used a special version of the Ak 5D called CGA5P or {{sometimes}} (incorrectly) Ak 5DP. Essentially it is a black (instead of the regular military green) Ak 5D with automatic fire capability disabled by a hex screw, which can be removed if automatic fire is needed. Unlike the Ak 5D, the police version has fixed sights but is still equipped with the MIL-STD-1913 rail system to allow the use of telescopic sights or red dot sights. Unlike its military counterparts (except for the AK5C/D versions), the police version has <b>safety</b> <b>catches</b> {{on both sides of}} the weapon.|$|R

500|$|The Hong Kong Police and Singapore Police Force {{were issued}} Webley Mk III & Mk IV (38S then.38/200 - Never use 38/200 in a Webley Mark III proofed for black powder 38S only) revolvers from the 1930s. Singaporean police (and some other [...] "officials") Webleys were {{equipped}} with <b>safety</b> <b>catches,</b> a rather unusual feature in a revolver. These were gradually retired in the 1970s {{as they came}} in for repair, and were replaced with Smith & Wesson Model 10 [...]38 revolvers. The London Metropolitan Police were also known to use Webley revolvers, as were most colonial police units until just after the Second World War. There may still be some police units with Webley Mk IV revolvers that, whilst not issued, are still present in the armoury.|$|R

500|$|Later another North Korean T-34 {{tank and}} {{supporting}} infantry pressed to within [...] of the B Company headquarters, before stopping and taking up a position between the ridges still {{unaware of the}} location of the Australians. An attempt by the Australian infantrymen to engage the tank with a new M20 3.5-inch bazooka failed however after the weapon misfired, and it subsequently withdrew out of range. The tank then continued to fire randomly {{for the remainder of the}} night, without effect. In reserve, C Company was subsequently woken during the battle to send a number of their bazookas forward to replace those used by B Company as it was suspected that theirs were faulty due to being poorly maintained. However, in their first close engagement with North Korean armour, it was possible that some of the Australians had simply forgotten to move the <b>safety</b> <b>catches</b> of their bazookas to the firing position in their excitement. Following firm directions the bazookas were used to good effect by 3 RAR in a number of encounters with tanks during the next few days. Regardless, despite using infantry mounted on tanks the North Koreans seemed unable to conduct the sort of organised or co-ordinated assault required to dislodge the Australians, and they were relatively untroubled for the rest of the night.|$|R

50|$|The PYa is a high-capacity, double-action, short-recoil {{semi-automatic}} pistol. Barrel/slide locking is {{a simplified}} Colt-Browning design, {{similar to that}} found in many modern pistols (for example the SIG Sauer and Glock families of pistols); the breech end of the barrel is rectangular in shape, rather than rounded, and fits into matching locking grooves within the slide, near the ejection port. The slide stop lever can be mounted {{on either side of}} the weapon to accommodate both left- and right-handed users. Likewise, the manual safety is ambidextrous, with <b>safety</b> <b>catches</b> on both sides of the weapon, where it is manipulated by the thumb. It is mounted on the frame, below the rear slide grooves, and directly behind the slide stop lever. The hammer is partially concealed at the sides to prevent catching on clothes and equipment. The magazine release catch is located in the base of the trigger guard on the left side, where it can be manipulated with the thumb (right-handed users) or index or middle finger (left-handed users). The front sight is formed as a fixed part of the slide and is non-adjustable. The back sight is drift adjustable for windage (dovetail type), but this requires a tool. Both feature white contrast elements to ease aiming in low-light conditions. The standard magazine capacity is 17 rounds, fed from a double-column, single feed magazine. Magazines with an 18 round capacity were produced after 2004.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} programming language support for interactive dialogues that exhibit the same flexibility as Web dialogues. A foundational model of Web interactions {{provides a framework}} for formally describing two classes of errors. The model suggests techniques for detecting both classes of errors. An incrementally checked record type system eectively eliminates one class of errors. A dynamic <b>safety</b> check <b>catches</b> the other class of errors relative to programmers' simple annotations. In practice, programming with continuations greatly facilitates the implementation of Web dialogues. This dissertation explores two techniques for extending programming languages with Web interaction primitives based on continuations. The first technique relies on a custom Web server {{that acts as a}} high-level operating system for Scheme servlets. Managing both server and servlets in one process results in good performance and easy communication between servlets. The second technique relies on whole-program transformations often found in compilers for functional programming languages. This results in standard CGI programs that run on any We...|$|R
