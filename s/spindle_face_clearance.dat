40|$|An {{incompressible}} air-flow {{model for}} a fluid film bearing is derived using a modified Reynolds equation for the thin-film dynamics of a rapidly rotating rotor and stator. Mathematical and numerical modelling {{is applied to the}} coupled processes of the fluid flow through the bearing and the axial motion of the rotor and stator. This work focuses on extending previous studies to incorporate the dynamics of a coned rotor operating at high speeds and an incompressible lubrication approximation. The dynamics of fully coupled, unsteady bearing motion and associated forcing of the rotor with axial periodic oscillations are studied. The axial motion of the stator is modelled as a spring–mass–damper system that responds to the rotor displacement through the film dynamics. In order to solve the modified Reynolds equation and stator equation simultaneously, a new variable is introduced, namely the time-dependent <b>face</b> <b>clearance.</b> This leads to explicit analytical expressions for the pressure and force in terms of the <b>face</b> <b>clearance</b> and the stator equation is transformed to a non-linear, second-order, non-autonomous, ordinary differential equation for the <b>face</b> <b>clearance.</b> Applying a transient solver gives solutions settling down to a stable periodic behaviour which motivates seeking a solver for periodic solutions. A Fourier spectral collocation scheme is derived to compute the periodic time-dependent <b>face</b> <b>clearance.</b> Both solvers have matching periodic solutions of O(1) with an absolute error of order of magnitude 10 − 5. The dynamics of the unsteady bearing are examined for a range of pressure gradients and configurations including an asymptotic investigation of small <b>face</b> <b>clearance</b> associated with a start-up transient. Results are provided relating to changes in the width of the bearing, strength of the spring holding stator to its housing, damping of the stator and strength of the force coupling and rotor mass. The dynamics of the bearing are also investigated relative to values of key system parameters including the coning of the rotor, rotation speed and value of the bearing squeeze number. A parameter investigation is undertaken to highlight ideal bearing configurations to maximize the load-carrying capacity, fluid stiffness and damping...|$|R

Previous studies including a Navier slip length shear condition on the bearing faces are extended to investigate applications with a coned bearing gap. A modified Reynolds equation for the film flow is coupled, through the pressure exerted by the fluid film, to the dynamic motion of the stator.

The forces generated by leakage flow along the front shroud surface of a centrifugal turbomachine impeller {{play an important role}} among these fluid-induced forces.

Hydrodynamic forces and steady and unsteady pressure distributions on the rotating shroud were measured as functions of eccentricity, width of shroud <b>clearance,</b> <b>face</b> seal <b>clearance</b> and shaft rotating speed. The forces measured from the dynamometer and manometers agreed well. The hydrodynamic force matrices were found skew-symmetric and statically unstable. This is qualitatively similar to the result of previous hydrodynamic volute force measurements. Nondimensionalized normal and tangential forces decrease slightly as Reynolds number increases. As the width of the shroud clearance decreases and/or the eccentricity increases, the hydrodynamic forces increase nonlinearly. There was some evidence found that increased front seal clearance could reduce the radial shroud forces and the relative magnitude of the destabilizing tangential force.

The present research investigates the contributions to the rotor dynamic forces from the discharge-to-suction leakage flows between the front shroud of the rotating impeller and the stationary pump casing. An experiment was designed to measure the rotordynamic shroud forces due to simulated leakage flows for different parameters such as flowrate, shroud <b>clearance,</b> <b>face</b> seal <b>clearance,</b> and eccentricity. The functional dependence on the ration of whirl frequency to rotating frequency (termed the whirl ratio) {{is very similar to}} that measured in experiments and similar t that predicted by the theoretical work of Childs [1]. Childs? bulk flow model yielded some unusual results including peaks in the rotordynamics forces at particular positive whirl ratios, a phenomenon which Childs tentatively described as a ?resonance? of leakage flow. This unexpected phenomenon developed at small positive whirl ratios when the inlet swirl velocity ratio exceeds about 0. 5. Childs points out that a typical swirl velocity ratio at inlet (pump discharge) would be about 0. 5 and may not, therefore, be large enough for the resonance to be manifest. To explore whether this effect occurs, an inlet guide vane was constructed which introduced a known amount of swirl into the flow upstream of the leakage flow inlet. A detailed comparison of model predictions with the present experimental program is presented. The experimental results showed no evidence of the ?resonances,? even at much larger swirl inlet velocities than explored by Childs...|$|R

The differences in edge recession under — 1 kV for the three kinds of coated tools were not detectable. The tool-wear progression under + 1 kV for all tools occurred quickly. By regarding edge recession at — 1 kV as being caused by a mechanical wear mechanism, the ratio of corrosive wear to the total edge recession under 0 V could be obtained.

Mitotic motors include polymerizing and depolymerizing MTs that exert pushing and pulling forces, respectively as well as some members of the dynein and kinesin families, which generate force in the spindle by stepping along the MT polymer lattice. Here we discuss general principles of force generation by dynamic MTs and motor proteins and their deployment in the spindle. We do not present a comprehensive review of the recent literature on mitotic motors which is covered in other review...|$|R
40|$|The fact thu {{the surface}} {{obtained}} in finish-turning {{are worse than}} is expected on theoretical grounds, is disconcerting. These results are due {{to the formation of}} groove wear in the <b>clearance</b> <b>face</b> of tool. As described in this paper quantative relations between surface roughness and groove wear are studied. Following results are attained. 1) Development of groove wear with tool travel is greatly affected by chip flow direction and feed. 2) Maximum depth of groove can be showed as function of chip flow angle and feed. 3) Formation of surface roughness is affected by groove wear, that is, the fact that grooves transfer to surface of workpiece is observed. 4) Depth of groove is made shallower when end-cutting-edge angle, feed and angle between chip flow direction and rotatory axis of workpiece are selected smaller...|$|R
