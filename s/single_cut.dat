25|$|It was {{a poorly}} pitched game for both starters, {{both of whom}} would last four innings or less. Greg Maddux faced Rick Ankiel. In {{the bottom of the}} first, Maddux allowed four {{straight}} hits to lead off the inning, the last two of which scored a run each. An error on Ray Lankford's ground ball allowed another run to score, then after a sacrifice bunt and intentional, Placido Polanco's single aided by another error cleared the bases, making it 6–0 Cardinals. But the Braves would make a game of it {{in the top of the}} third when Ankiel's control slipped away. He walked Maddux and Andruw Jones, then threw four wild pitches to put them on second and third. Ankiel then threw another wild pitch on a ball four to Andres Galarraga, walking him and letting Maddux score. Brian Jones then hit an RBI single and after another wild pitch and walk loaded the bases, Walt Weiss's two-run <b>single</b> <b>cut</b> the Cardinals' lead to 6–4. Jim Edmonds's fourth-inning home run make it 7–4 Cardinals. After the fourth, Maddux was done. In the top of the ninth, an error and walk put runners on first and second off of Dave Veres before Jordan's RBI <b>single</b> <b>cut</b> the Cardinals' lead to 7–5 and put the tying runs on, but Veres retired the next two batters to end the game. Mike James would get the win in relief of Ankiel.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Jewish thought has {{expressed}} {{the view that}} all meat must come from animals which have been slaughtered according to Jewish law. These strict guidelines require the animal be killed by a <b>single</b> <b>cut</b> across the throat to a precise depth, severing both carotid arteries, both jugular veins, both vagus nerves, the trachea and the esophagus, no higher than the epiglottis and no lower than where cilia begin inside the trachea, causing the animal to bleed to death. Orthodox Jews argue that this ensures the animal dies instantly without unnecessary suffering, but many animal rights activists view the process as cruel, arguing that the animal may not lose consciousness immediately, and activists have called {{for it to be}} banned.|$|E
25|$|When Seki {{heard the}} song, {{he wanted to}} create a video that would express the song's lyrics well, noting that they were written entirely in Japanese. He {{discussed}} wanting to visually express the song's lyrics to the band in an interview, and suggested an idea he previously had learnt about: a camera technique where objects could only be seen from one particular angle. The band gave Seki full creative control over the project, however Yamaguchi requested that the video feature night and dark colors. To contrast with the song's digital sound, Seki decided to shoot the video without any digital editing, only utilizing analog techniques and objects. Seki felt that for the video to have its full effect, it should be shot in a <b>single</b> <b>cut.</b> He originally intended to shoot the video with a steadicam, however this equipment had difficulties being used for an uninterrupted five-minute take. Instead, Seki used a handheld Canon EOS 5D Mark II.|$|E

500|$|The term {{bacon in}} this book does not refer to the sliced and {{pre-packaged}} bacon that is ubiquitous in American markets, but instead the cured whole side of the pig. Furthermore, the differences between bacon in the United States and in the United Kingdom are quite pronounced, and the book refers only to cuts common in the United Kingdom. The cut {{that is used to}} produce [...] "American bacon" [...] is a cut referred to as [...] "streaky bacon" [...] in the United Kingdom. Most bacon consumed in the United Kingdom is known as back bacon and consists of both pork belly and pork loin in a <b>single</b> <b>cut.</b> The Wiltshire cut was a way to divide up the meat, and was marketed to consumers in still further cuts.|$|E
500|$|Whale {{was known}} for his use of camera movement. He is {{credited}} with being the first director to use a 360-degree panning shot in a feature film, included in Frankenstein. Whale used a similar technique during the Ol' Man River sequence in Show Boat, in which the camera tracked around Paul Robeson as he sang the song. (The sequence also uses expressionist montages illustrating some of the lyrics.) Often singled out for praise in Frankenstein is the series of shots used to introduce the Monster: [...] "Nothing can ever quite efface the thrill of watching the successive views Whale's mobile camera allows us of the lumbering figure". These shots, starting with a medium shot and culminating in two close-ups of the Monster's face, were repeated by Whale to introduce Griffin in The Invisible Man and the abusive husband in One More River. Modified to a <b>single</b> <b>cut</b> rather than two, Whale uses the same technique in The Road Back to signal the instability of a returning World War I veteran.|$|E
500|$|The album sold {{moderately}} well—including on-site {{sales at}} the Hungry i during the Kingston Trio's engagement there through the summer—but it was DJs Paul Colburn and Bill Terry at station KLUB in Salt Lake City whose enthusiasm for a <b>single</b> <b>cut</b> {{on the record}} spurred the next development in the group's history. Colburn began playing [...] "Tom Dooley" [...] extensively on his show, prompting a rush of album sales in the Salt Lake area by fans who wanted {{to listen to the}} song, as yet unavailable as a single record. Colburn called other DJs around the country urging them to do the same, and national response to the song was so strong that a reluctant Capitol Records finally released the tune as a 45rpm single on August 8, 1958; it reached the number 1 spot on the Billboard chart by late November, sold a million copies by Christmas, and was awarded a gold record on January 21, 1959. [...] "Tom Dooley" [...] also spurred the debut album to a number 1 position on the charts and helped the band earn a second gold record for the LP, which remained charted on Billboard's weekly reports for 195 weeks.|$|E

Prior {{to the development}} of modern machining equipment it provided a relatively accurate means for the production of small parts, especially those with flat surfaces.

The last song on the album, the 7minute, 47second-long [...] "747", with a characteristic keyboard riff and a long instrumental outro, became the band's closer for every show for the next 8 years, and won numerous best-song polls on Kent's website.

2500|$|The {{history of}} diamond cuts {{can be traced}} to the late Middle Ages, before which time {{diamonds}} were employed in their natural octahedral state—anhedral (poorly formed) diamonds simply were not used in jewelry. The first [...] "improvements" [...] on nature's design involved a simple polishing of the octahedral crystal faces to create even and unblemished facets, or to fashion the desired octahedral shape out of an otherwise unappealing piece of rough. This was called the point cut and dates from the mid 14th century; by 1375 there was a guild of diamond polishers at Nürnberg. By the mid 15th century, the point cut began to be improved upon: a little less than one half of the octahedron would be sawn off, creating the table cut. The importance of a culet was also realised, and some table-cut stones may possess one. The addition of four corner facets created the old <b>single</b> <b>cut</b> (or old eight cut). Neither of these early cuts would reveal what diamond is prized for today; its strong dispersion or fire. At the time, diamond was valued chiefly for its adamantine lustre and superlative hardness; a table-cut diamond would appear black to the eye, as they do in paintings of the era. For this reason, colored gemstones such as ruby and sapphire were far more popular in jewelry of the era.|$|E
