40|$|Abstract of Thesis Excitotoxicity {{can lead}} to {{increases}} in intracellular Na+ and Ca 2 + concentrations via the glutamatergic NMDA receptors, which {{can lead to}} cell death. Detailing the time-dependent degradation of neuronal components in response to excitotoxic challenge may help elucidate the sequence in which these signaling pathways are initiated and further, associate these pathways with topographic cellular demise. Using organotypic hippocampal slice culture technique, tissue from neonatal rat pups was exposed to NMDA, APV, or co-exposed for 24, 72 or 120 hours. Fluorescent microscopy of propidium iodide (PI) was used to evaluate neuronal membrane damage, changes in the density of mature soma (NeuN) and NMDA NR 2 B subunits were measured using immunohistochemical procedures. After 24 hours of exposure, the CA 1 showed an increased PI signal and a decrease in NeuN marker, indicating <b>somatic</b> <b>injury</b> occurs shortly after excitotoxic challenge; these effects were blocked by co-administration of APV. Also in the CA 1, loss of NR 2 B subunits, heavily expressed in dendritic processes, declined following 72 hours of exposure. Because <b>somatic</b> <b>injury</b> precedes loss of dista...|$|E
40|$|Diffuse {{brain injury}} (DBI) is a {{consequence}} of traumatic brain injury evoked via rapid acceleration – deceleration of the cranium, giving rise to subtle pathological changes appreciated best at the microscopic level. DBI is believed to be comprised by diffuse axonal injury and other forms of diffuse vascular change. The potential, however, that the same forces can also directly injure neuronal somata in vivo has not been considered. Recently, while investigating DBI-mediated perisomatic axonal injury, we identified scattered, rapid neuronal somatic necrosis occurring within the same domains. Moving on the premise that these cells sustained direct <b>somatic</b> <b>injury</b> as a result of DBI, we initiated the current study, in which rats were intracerebroventricularly infused with various high-molecular weight tracers (HMWTs) to identify injury-induced neuronal somatic plasmalemmal disruption. These studies revealed that DBI caused immediate, scattered neuronal somatic plasmalemmal injury to all of the extracellular HMWTs used. Through this approach, a spectrum of neuronal change was observed, ranging from rapid necrosis of the tracer-laden neurons to little or no pathological change at the light and electron microscopic level. Parallel double and triple studies using markers of neuronal degeneration, stress, and axonal injury identified additional injured neuronal phenotypes arising in close proximity to, but independent of, neurons demonstrating plasmalemmal disruption. These findings reveal that direct neuronal <b>somatic</b> <b>injury</b> is a component of DBI, and diffuse trauma elicits a heretofore-unrecognized multifaceted neuronal pathological change within the CNS, generating heterogeneous injury and reactive alteration within both axons and neuronal somata in the same domains.

40|$|AbstractTemporomandibular {{disorder}} and {{irritable bowel syndrome}} are comorbid functional chronic pain disorders of unknown etiology that are triggered/exacerbated by stress. Here we present baseline phenotypic characterization of a novel animal model to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms that contribute to such comorbid pain conditions. In this model, chronic visceral hypersensitivity, a defining symptom of irritable bowel syndrome, is dependent on 3 factors: estradiol, existing chronic somatic pain, and stress. In ovariectomized rats, estradiol replacement followed by craniofacial muscle injury and stress induced visceral hypersensitivity that persisted for months. Omission of any 1 factor resulted in a transient (1  week) visceral hypersensitivity from stress alone or no hypersensitivity (no inflammation or estradiol). Maintenance of visceral hypersensitivity was estradiol dependent, resolving when estradiol replacement ceased. Referred cutaneous hypersensitivity was concurrent with visceral hypersensitivity. Increased spinal Fos expression suggests induction of central sensitization. These data demonstrate the development and maintenance of visceral hypersensitivity in estradiol-replaced animals following distal <b>somatic</b> <b>injury</b> and stress that mimics some characteristics reported in patients with temporomandibular {{disorder and}} comorbid irritable bowel syndrome. This new animal model is a powerful experimental tool that can be employed to gain further mechanistic insight into overlapping pain conditions. PerspectiveThe majority of patients with temporomandibular disorder report symptoms consistent with irritable bowel syndrome. Stress and female prevalence are common to both conditions. In a new experimental paradigm in ovariectomized rats with estradiol replacement, masseter inflammation followed by stress induces visceral hypersensitivity that persists for months, modeling these comorbid pain conditions...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Jumping {{from great}} height is an {{aggressive}} method of suicide attempt where the frequent combination of psychiatric disorder and <b>somatic</b> <b>injuries</b> makes treatment difficult. Our {{aim was to}} evaluate survival rate and get patient-reported outcome in patients operated for a pelvic or acetabular fracture sustained when jumping from a height as a suicide attempt. Patients and Methods: During the period 2003 - 2004, 12 patients (11 women) of whom eight were below 30 years of age, were prospectively included. At two years HRQoL (Health-Related Quality of Life) questionnaires (SF- 36 and LiSat- 11) were used to describe outcome, and at four years a structured psychiatric interview SCID-I (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders) was done. Results: At four years all patients were alive. One patient had made a new suicide attempt. Eight patients gave adequate reply on SF- 36 and LiSat- 11 at two years. In all domains patients scored lower than a norm group with the relatively lowest values in physical domains. Younger patients assessed life as better when compared with middle aged patients. Conclusions: This study showed a very low recurrence rate into suicidal behaviour {{in a group of}} jumpers and all patients were alive at four years after a suicidal attempt by jumping. The high proportion of psychiatric disorder in these patients highlights the need for a combined treatment effort between orthopaedic and psychiatric expertise...|$|R

40|$|Invasive {{bacterial}} infection in mammals often stimulates a fatal syndrome of hypotension, organ dysfunction and somatic tissue edema (1). This systemic response to critical illness in man {{is associated with}} <b>somatic</b> cell <b>injury,</b> as measured by a decrease in skeletal muscle transmembrane potential difference (Em), increased cellular sodium and water levels, and depletion of cellular potassium stores (2). These alterations in plasma membrane function are not temporally related to inadequate tissue perfusion or to depletion of high-energy phosphate stores (3). To date. no direct mediator for this deterioration of plasma membrane and electrolyte homeostasis has been identified. Recent work (4, 5) has shown that cachectin/tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important mediator ofthe lethal effects of endotoxin/LPS (6), and is produced in large quantities by macrophages exposed to endotoxin (7, 8). High-affinity receptors for cachectin (7) stimulate altered cellular energy metabolism both in vivo and in vitro, but the evaluation of target tissues thus far has not demonstrated any adverse influence on normal cell viability.

40|$|Persistent somatoform pain {{disorder}} (PSPD) is {{a mental}} disorder un-associated with any <b>somatic</b> <b>injury</b> {{and can cause}} severe somatosensory and emotional impairments in patients. However, so far, the neuro-pathophysiological mechanism of the functional impairments in PSPD is still unclear. The present study assesses the difference in regional spontaneous activity between PSPD and healthy controls (HC) during a resting state, in order to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying PSPD. Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data were obtained from 13 PSPD patients and 23 age- and gender-matched HC subjects in this study. Kendall's coefficient of concordance {{was used to measure}} regional homogeneity (ReHo), and a two-sample t-test was subsequently performed to investigate the ReHo difference between PSPD and HC. Additionally, the correlations between the mean ReHo of each survived area and the clinical assessments were further analyzed. Compared with the HC group, patients with PSPD exhibited decreased ReHo in the bilateral primary somatosensory cortex, posterior cerebellum, and occipital lobe, while increased ReHo in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and default mode network (including the medial PFC, right inferior parietal lobe (IPL), and left supramarginal gyrus). In addition, significant positive correlations were found between the mean ReHo of both right IPL and left supramarginal gyrus and participants' Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) scores, and between the mean ReHo of the left middle frontal gyrus and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores. Our results suggest that abnormal spontaneous brain activity in specific brain regions during a resting state may be associated with the dysfunctions in pain, memory and emotional processing commonly observed in patients with PSPD. These findings help us to understand the neural mechanisms underlying PSPD and suggest that the ReHo metric {{could be used as a}} clinical marker for PSPD...|$|E

This study was designed to create a rat model of abdominal surgery using anesthetic methods and perioperative treatment similar to those used in the clinic and to investigate the effects of different injury severities and depths of anesthesia and analgesia on surgical stress and postoperative recovery. Abdominal skin/muscle incision was compared with exploratory laparotomy in rats under propofol intravenous anesthesia, accompanied by perioperative measures such as oxygen inhalation, fluid infusion, warmth, blood gas analysis, and infection prevention. Stress indices (mean arterial pressure, heart rate, blood glucose, and plasma corticosterone) were monitored during anesthesia and surgery, and recovery indicators (body weight, food consumption, and pain) were measured after surgery. In addition, animals undergoing laparotomy were subjected to low and high dosages of propofol and sufentanil, in order {{to examine the relationship between}} anesthetic and analgesic depth and stress on recovery. Exploratory laparotomy induced a greater stress response and caused slower postoperative recovery as measured than <b>somatic</b> <b>injury.</b> High-dose sufentanil downregulated plasma corticosterone and improved postoperative recovery more effectively than high-dose propofol (P< 0. 05). Taken together, a rat model of abdominal surgery using anesthetic methods and perioperative treatment similar to those used in the clinic was successfully developed. It showed a positive correlation between severity of surgical trauma and stress response and postoperative recovery and a significant role of adequate analgesia in reducing surgical stress and improving postoperative recovery.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 The public {{controversy}} over possible health hazards from radioactive fallout from atomic bomb testing began in 1954, shortly after a thermonuclear test by the United States spread fallout world wide. In the dissertation, I address {{two of the}} fundamental questions of the fallout controversy: Was there a threshold of radiation exposure below which {{there would be no}} significant injury? What was the role of a responsible scientist in a public scientific debate? Genetics and medicine were the scientific fields most directly involved in the debate over the biological effects of radiation. Geneticists' prewar experiences with radiation led them to believe that there was no safe level of radiation exposure and that any amount of radiation would cause a proportional amount of genetic injury. In contrast to geneticists, physicians and medical researchers generally believed that there was a threshold for <b>somatic</b> <b>injury</b> from radiation. One theme of the dissertation is an examination of how different scientific conceptual and methodological approaches affected how geneticists and medical researchers evaluated the possible health effects of fallout. Geneticists and physicians differed not only in their evaluations of radiation hazards, but also in their views of how the debate over fallout should be conducted. A central question of the fallout debate was how a responsible scientist should act in a public policy controversy involving scientific issues upon which the scientific community had not yet reached a consensus. Based on their assumption that any increase in radiation exposure was harmful, most geneticists believed that they had a responsibility to speak out publicly about the deleterious effects of radiation. Physicians, who believed in the likelihood of a threshold for significant radiation-induced injury, generally adopted the opposite view. They believed that public discussion of possible, but improbable, radiation hazards was irresponsible because it risked creating irrational public fear of radiation exposure. In my dissertation, I examine how the different positions of geneticists and physicians over what constituted responsible public scientific debate affected the rhetoric of the controversy, as well as the implications of the debate in matters of politics and policy...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To study {{morbidity}} amongst {{homeless men}} and women by comparing prevalence of hospital care for <b>somatic</b> diseases and <b>injuries</b> with a control group of {{men and women}} from the general population. Methods: A cohort of 1, 364 men and 340 women were documented as homeless in 1996. Comparisons are made concerning hospital care for <b>somatic</b> diseases and <b>injuries</b> (1996 - 2002) among 3, 750 men and 1, 250 women from the general population. Results: The relative risk (RR) for homeless men and women of being hospitalised was double that {{of the men and women}} in the controls (1. 93 and 1. 96 respectively). Homeless women had a slightly, not significant, increased risk compared to homeless men (RR 1. 10). Younger homeless women had a significant higher risk. Among diagnostic categories, the highest prevalence was found among homeless men in the diagnosis group injury/poisoning (22 %). The highest risk was found for skin diseases (RR 36. 96) and concerned homeless women. There were a number of gender specific diagnoses, where risks were considerably elevated, such as diseases of the genital organs, viral hepatitis, and poisoning for homeless women, and cerebrovascular diseases, diseases of the liver, and concussion for homeless men. Conclusions: Homeless people had twice the risk of being hospitalised for physical diseases compared to the general population. Younger women were particularly at risk compared to homeless men and to women in the controls. There were a number of gender specific diagnoses that are important to take into account when planning services for homeless people...|$|R

The causes, strategies for their avoidance, and the clinical course of these complications are also disscused. The study group was composed of 136 women and 84 men whose mean age was 60 years (range 20 - 86 years). Single level fusion was performed in 186 patients, multiple level fusion in 34 patients. Complications occured in 51 patients (23, 2 %), including dural tears in 13, postoperative hemorrhage in 4, <b>somatic</b> neural <b>injury</b> in 7, postoperative infections in 13, mechanical complications like screw fractures in 9, myocardial infarction in 1.

The incidence of complications was not associated with underlying diagnosis, any attendant disease or the number of levels exposed. During the years the number of complications in the studied group however was related to a certain learning curve effect.

40|$|Summary–main findings. Legal {{framework}} A new framework {{consisting of}} regulations and guidelines for opioid substitution treatment of heroin addicts, as {{laid down in}} the Act relating to specialist health services, entered into force on 1 February 2010. The new framework is intended to contribute to equal provision of opioid substi- tution treatment throughout the country, and to help to integrate such treatment {{with the rest of}} the health service. The age limit no longer ap- plies, but before someone is offered opioid sub- stitution treatment, an assessment must always be carried out of whether the patient will benefit from treatment without such medication. The Health Personnel Act and the Act relating to specialist health services were amended with effect from 2010. The amendments, which concern the follow-up of children as family members, have strengthened children’s legal status and ensured that minor children of parents with mental illness, drug/alcohol dependency, serious <b>somatic</b> illnesses or <b>injuries</b> receive better follow-up when their parents receive medical help. In 2010, the Norwegian Medicines Agency has added eleven new drugs to the list of narcotic substances, cf. the Regulations relating to narcotics. These are: GBL, 1, 4 –butandiol, fenazepam, Bentazepam, Bk-MBDB, Bromo-Dragonfly, 4 -fluoride amphetamine, mCPP, MBDB, mephedrone and PMMA. With the exception of mCPP, all the drugs were previously covered by the derivative rule in the same regulation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} methods and {{complications}} of exposing the anterior aspects of the thoracic and lumbosacral spine. Data Sources PubMed (journals database of the National Library of Medicine), text books, the University HealthSystem Consortium Clinical Process Improvement Benchmarking Project, a newspaper, and the US government Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Study Selection Descriptions {{of morbidity and mortality}} specifically related to anterior spine exposure depicted in both case reports and clinical series were used. Data Extraction Mortality data from clinical series with more than 30 cases were tabulated. Morbidity incidences were described. Data Synthesis The frequency of anterior exposure of the spine for structural operations is steadily increasing. Both thoracic and lumbosacral anterior spine operations are associated with exposure-related complication rates of 10 % to 50 %. Pulmonary complications are frequent after thoracic exposures. Chylothorax is the most common of several rarer chest-exposure complications. Vascular complications, particularly arterial thrombosis (< 1 % of cases) and venous bleeding (2 %- 15 % of cases), are the most frequent complications at the lumbar level. Other lumbosacral exposure complications include ureteral and nerve (<b>somatic</b> and sympathetic) <b>injury.</b> The mortality rate in anterior spine exposures is less than 1 %. Conclusions: The exposure portions of anterior spine operations result in numerous complications. There are fewer reported complications with endoscopic exposures of the anterior spine than with open exposures, although endoscopic exposures have been used for less complicated cases. In comparable cases, neither exposure nor results of endoscopic operations have proven better than operations done through minilaparotomy incisions. Perioperative cooperation between exposing and spine surgeons is necessary to enhance results in anterior spine operations...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{results from}} {{epidemiological}} cohort studies of {{morbidity and mortality}} among homeless men and women are presented. Comparisons were made with the general population concerning hospital care for <b>somatic</b> diseases, <b>injury</b> and mental disorders, and concerning mortality. The thesis contains also the results from a five-year follow-up study of 82 homeless men with mental problems. Results from Paper I shows that the mortality among the 82 homeless men was higher than expected (SMR 4. 7). Surprisingly, among men with severe psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, none had died at the follow-up. Among the survivors, 75 % were still homeless, and the mental health problems combined with substance use problems had increased. Paper II, shows that among 1 364 homeless men and 340 homeless women, the relative risk of being hospitalised for physical diseases was double that {{of men and women in}} the general population. When age was considered, younger homeless women had the highest risk compared to homeless men (RR 1. 6). The highest prevalence was found in the diagnosis group injury/poisoning (22 % men, and 20 % women). The highest risk was found for skin diseases (RR 36. 9) and concerned homeless women. Paper III shows that among 1 364 homeless men and 340 homeless women, the relative risk of having mental disorders, including alcohol and drugs, was 13 - 21 times higher that of the general population. The homeless women ran a higher risk compared with homeless men (RR 1. 2), where younger homeless women had the highest risk (RR 2. 2). Alcohol use disorders were equally common among homeless men and women, but women had more drug use disorders (RR 1. 3). Women had a higher risk of schizophrenia (RR 2. 8), and personality disorders (RR 2. 7). When adjustment was made for substance use disorders, no increased risk for mental disorder was found in the homeless group. Paper IV reports a relative risk of 3. 1 for death among 1 758 homeless men compared with men in the population, and a relative risk of 2. 5 for 527 homeless women compared to women in the population. No difference in mortality was found between homeless men and women. The mortality among men was principally related to alcohol, and among women to drug abuse. For homeless men with long homelessness and mental problems including substance misuse, the life and housing situation had not improved at the 5 -year follow-up, and substance misuse problems and mental problems had increased among them. There was no connection between mortality and mental illness. Among homeless men and women the risk of having diseases that requires hospitalisation was very high, compared with the general population. Younger homeless women were particularly at risk. There were a number of gender specific somatic and psychiatric diagnoses that are important to take into account when planning services for homeless people. The excess risk for mental illness found among the homeless was entirely related to alcohol and drug misuse, as was their excess mortality...|$|R
