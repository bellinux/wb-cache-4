500|$|From its beginning, the Sunday Expresss {{campaign}} {{drew the}} attention of other papers. Some backed Douglas, including the Sunday Chronicle, The People and Truth. The Daily News and Westminster Gazette ran a review that, without commenting on Douglas's action, said the novel [...] "present as a martyr {{a woman in the}} grip of a vice". Most of the British press defended The Well. The Nation suggested that the Sunday Express had only started its campaign because it was August, the journalistic <b>silly</b> <b>season</b> when good stories are scarce. Country Life and Lady's Pictorial both ran positive reviews. Arnold Dawson of the Daily Herald, a Labour newspaper, called Douglas a [...] "stunt journalist"; he said no one would give the book to a child, no child would want to read it, and any who did would find nothing harmful. Dawson also printed a scathing condemnation of the Home Office by H. G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw and started a counter-campaign that helped Hall obtain statements of support from the National Union of Railwaymen and the South Wales Miners' Federation.|$|E

Scrooge's misanthropic thoughts in this first story are quite pronounced: [...] "Here I sit in this big lonely dump, waiting for Christmas to pass! Bah!

And prepare to hear more of the squeaky clean 'made for FM' music because there is plenty more on offer on the album – but that isn't so bad." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Wright of The Stage likens [...] "Journey’s End" [...] to [...] "one {{big house}} of cards... will come {{crashing}} down" [...] if thought about too much. However, {{he had no}} problem with the resolution of [...] "The Stolen Earth"'s cliffhanger and is critical of those who complain about feeling cheated by the lack of a regeneration. Though he expresses that he saw little need for Mickey and Jackie in this episode, he asserts that Donna had [...] "the saddest end for a companion ever" [...] and praises Davies for just managing to keep the plot together. He argues that as Davies [...] "writes the emotions and big themes so well...blow logic and rational plot moments if they get in the way!" [...] He compares Davies's writing style to [...] "PT Barnum showmanship" [...] and praises both the dark and light elements of the episode. He concludes that, if not overthought, the episode remains [...] "an audacious, big, <b>silly,</b> often poignant <b>season</b> finale".|$|R
2500|$|In late May, it {{was rumored}} that Edwards was leaving Roush's team for good. Edwards kept quiet for months over the rumors. During NASCAR RaceDay, Edwards stated he {{declined}} an offer from Richard Childress Racing which made everybody speculate that Edwards already had plans for 2015. On June 19, Jayski's <b>Silly</b> <b>Season</b> Site stated he heard [...] "that the deal between Edwards and Joe Gibbs Racing is done, no word when it will be announced." [...] On July 27, RFR announced the 2015 lineup, with Edwards not listed.|$|E
60|$|It was inevitable, in {{the height}} of the <b>Silly</b> <b>Season,</b> that such a topic as the {{simultaneous}} invasion of Great Britain by nine foreign powers should be seized upon by the press. Countless letters poured into the offices of the London daily papers every morning. Space forbids more than the gist of a few of these.|$|E

But imagine her difficulties!

60|$|Quietly he read, {{restraining}} himself, {{the first}} column and, yielding but resisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope it's not too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive. One tabloid of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It {{did not move}} or touch him {{but it was something}} quick and neat. Print anything now. <b>Silly</b> <b>season.</b> He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. Neat certainly. Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the laughing witch who now. Begins and ends morally. Hand in hand. Smart. He glanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow quietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received payment of three pounds, thirteen and six.|$|E
60|$|Was {{this the}} same Moreau? He had {{published}} some very astonishing facts {{in connection with}} the transfusion of blood, and in addition was known to be doing valuable work on morbid growths. Then suddenly his career was closed. He had to leave England. A journalist obtained access to his laboratory in the capacity of laboratory-assistant, with the deliberate intention of making sensational exposures; and by the help of a shocking accident (if it was an accident), his gruesome pamphlet became notorious. On the day of its publication a wretched dog, flayed and otherwise mutilated, escaped from Moreau's house. It was in the <b>silly</b> <b>season,</b> and a prominent editor, a cousin of the temporary laboratory-assistant, appealed to the conscience of the nation. It {{was not the first time}} that conscience has turned against the methods of research. The doctor was simply howled out of the country. It may be that he deserved to be; but I still think that the tepid support of his fellow-investigators and his desertion by the great body of scientific workers was a shameful thing. Yet some of his experiments, by the journalist's account, were wantonly cruel. He might perhaps have purchased his social peace by abandoning his investigations; but he apparently preferred the latter, as most men would who have once fallen under the overmastering spell of research. He was unmarried, and had indeed nothing but his own interest to consider.|$|E
60|$|For {{many generations}} past that problematical animal, the toad-in-a-hole (literal, not culinary) {{has been one}} of the most {{familiar}} and interesting personages of contemporary folk-lore and popular natural history. From time to time he turns up afresh, with his own wonted perennial vigour, on paper at least, in company with the great sea-serpent, the big gooseberry, the shower of frogs, the two-headed calf, and all the other common objects of the country or the seaside in the <b>silly</b> <b>season.</b> No extraordinary natural phenomenon on earth was ever better vouched for--in the fashion rendered familiar to us by the Tichborne claimant--that is to say, no other could ever get a larger number of unprejudiced witnesses to swear positively and unreservedly in its favour. Unfortunately, however, swearing alone no longer settles causes off-hand, as if by show of hands, 'the Ayes have it,' after the fashion prevalent in the good old days when the whole Hundred used to testify that of its certain knowledge John Nokes did not commit such and such a murder; whereupon John Nokes was forthwith acquitted accordingly. Nowadays, both justice and science have become more exacting; they insist upon the unpleasant and discourteous habit of cross-examining their witnesses (as if they doubted them, forsooth!), instead of accepting the witnesses' own simple assertion that it's all right, and there's no need for making a fuss about it. Did you yourself see the block of stone in which the toad is said to have been found, before the toad himself was actually extracted? Did you examine it all round to make quite sure there was no hole, or crack, or passage in it anywhere? Did you satisfy yourself after the toad was released from his close quarters that no such hole, or crack, or passage had been dexterously closed up, with intent to deceive, by plaster, cement, or other artificial composition? Did you ever offer the workmen who found it a nominal reward--say five shillings--for the first perfectly unanswerable specimen of a genuine unadulterated antediluvian toad? Have you got the toad now present, and can you produce him here in court (on writ of habeas corpus or otherwise), together with all the fragments of the stone or tree from which he was extracted? These are the disagreeable, prying, inquisitorial, I may even say insulting, questions with which a modern man of science is ready to assail the truthful and reputable gentlemen who venture to assert their discovery, in these degenerate days, of the ancient and unsophisticated toad-in-a-hole.|$|E
