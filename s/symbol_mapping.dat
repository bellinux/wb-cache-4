We present and utilise methods for finding new linear combinations of multiple polylogarithms (and specifically harmonic polylogarithms) that lie in the kernel of the <b>symbol</b> <b>map.</b> During this process we introduce a new pictorial construction for calculating the symbol, namely the hook-arrow tree, which can be used to easier encode symbol calculations onto a computer.

Using this we give the full symbol for I_ 2, 2, 2 (x,y,z). Through similar methods we also give the full symbol of coloured multiple zeta values.

30|$|Using the {{proposed}} unified framework, we also classify {{some of the}} existing OFDM OOBE suppression techniques into three groups depending on the positions where they are implemented in our framework. Here, the time-domain schemes remain in one group, but the frequency-domain schemes are further divided into two groups: the <b>symbol</b> <b>mapping</b> techniques and the precoding techniques. To demonstrate the convenience of using {{the proposed}} framework, we propose three new types of hybrid OOBE suppression schemes by selecting a scheme from each group and combining it with the precoding scheme in [14, 15] (will be called singular value decomposition (SVD) precoding due {{to the principle of}} its design). The three selected schemes are spectral precoding [16], N-continuous precoding [17] (will be called N-continuous <b>symbol</b> <b>mapping</b> in this paper due to our classification), and filtering [8]. It is obvious that spectral precoding, N-continuous <b>symbol</b> <b>mapping,</b> and filtering belong to the precoding, <b>symbol</b> <b>mapping,</b> and time-domain techniques, respectively. Since SVD precoding and each of the three selected schemes have complementary characteristics (which will be explained later in the paper), the three proposed combined schemes maintain the merits and avoid (or reduce) the drawbacks of the individual schemes involved. It will be shown that special designs need to be made for combining SVD precoding with spectral precoding or N-continuous <b>symbol</b> <b>mapping.</b> As for combining SVD precoding and filtering, a simple combining but no merging process is sufficient. Numerical results show the power spectral density (PSD) performance of the three proposed schemes for two scenarios, one with cyclic prefix (CP) and one without CP. It is shown that the proposed combined schemes indeed outperform their individual constituent schemes used, which also implies that the same goal can be achieved by the combined schemes with smaller cost than the individual schemes. Other performances like peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and bit error rate (BER) are briefly discussed. Practical considerations about complexity, numerical precision limit due to hardware constraints, and OOBE regrowth due to non-linear elements are also addressed.|$|E

By perturbing the data symbols to be transmitted by means of reordering or scrambling, {{the proposed}} scheme influences the ICI between the MIMO subchannels. It then chooses a <b>symbol</b> <b>mapping</b> such that the interference is optimised and the decision variables at the receiver are maximised.

In this work a family of candidate symbols, the Sarason Sub-Symbols, is introduced as a means of reproducing the symbol of a densely defined Toeplitz operator. This leads to a partial answer to a question posed by Donald Sarason in 2008. In the bounded case the Toeplitzness of an operator can be classified in terms of its Sarason Sub-Symbols. This justifies the investigation into the application of the Sarason Sub-Symbols on densely defined operators. It is shown that analytic closed densely defined Toeplitz operators are completely determined by their Sarason Sub-Symbols, and it is shown for a broader class of operators that they extend closed densely defined Toeplitz operators (of multiplication type).
