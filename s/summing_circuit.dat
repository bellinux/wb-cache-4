Therefore, {{this paper presents}} the analyses of various popular 1 -bit digital summing circuits in light of PVT (process, voltage and temperature) variations to verify their functionality and robustness. The investigation is carried with ± 3 ó process parameters and ± 10 % V DD (supply voltage) variation by applying Gaussian distribution and Monte Carlo analysis at 22 nm technology node on HSPICE environment. Design guidelines are derived to select the most suitable topology for the design features required.

I have always {{wondered what it would}} sound like to combine the two types of sounds and this senior project dissected that interest to its raw form. Delving into the problems and solutions of combining digital and analog audio signals intrigued me and thus, became my senior project. The design process included research into the analog and digital realms, computer simulations, and actual implementation successes and failures. The signal path begins at the bass drum where a piezoelectric drum triggering transducer converts vibration into a specific voltage level. This voltage level flows into a voltage comparator circuit. When the threshold voltage, pre-determined through various test methods, of the voltage comparator is exceeded, the rail voltage flows into a voltage-controlled, open-collector N-MOSFET circuit. This acts as a switch which closes when the threshold voltage has been exceeded, completing the circuit of the external trigger pins that directly trigger pre-selected MP 3 tracks on an MP 3 Trigger circuit. This signal flows into a voltage follower circuit which acts as buffer, eliminating distortion. Finally, the signal flows into a <b>summing</b> <b>circuit</b> with an adjustable gain. Meanwhile, a microphone picks up the bass drum’s acoustical energy (sound waves) and converts this energy into electrical energy (the audio signal).

40|$|The spectroscopic {{performance}} of photon counting detectors {{is limited by}} the effects of charge sharing between neighboring pixels and the emission of characteristic X-rays. For these reasons, an event can be either missed or counted more than once. These effects become more and more of a concern when pixel pitches are reduced, and for the technology available so far, this meant that there would always be a trade-off between a high spatial and a high spectral resolution. In this work, we present first measurements obtained with the new Medipix 3 RX ASIC, which features a network of charge <b>summing</b> <b>circuits</b> establishing a communication between pixels which helps to mitigate these effects.

40|$|Among M-phase {{shift keying}} (M-PSK) schemes, {{quadrature}} phase-shift keying (QPSK) is used most often because of its efficient bandwidth consumption.

40|$|A {{fluorescence}} recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) {{machine is}} an elaborate and expensive device which can excite the molecules {{of a sample}} of fluorescently dyed cell plasma membrane and measure the number of photons that the sample emits. The knowledge gained through such an experiment is biomedically useful because {{the intensity of the}} light emitted can be used to guage the mobility of the proteins in the plasma membrane. Because FRAP detectors are so costly, the goal in this project is to design and construct an electrical FRAP simulator. The rate, R(t), at which the photons are emitted from the membrane after excitation, is governed by the equation: R(t) = A - B/(l+Ct) + D/(1 +Ct) ², where t is time and A,B,C,D are positive constants. Given A,B,C,D and the other characteristics of a FRAP detector: opening and closing shutter delays, overload level of the PMT, and steady-state rate of photon emission before strong laser beam excitation; an analog voltage output, R(t), is produced. R(t) is created by using an integrator and a series of dividing, squaring, multiplying, and <b>summing</b> <b>circuits.</b> Finally, a TTL output with a frequency proportional to R(t) is produced by using a voltage contolled oscillator.

40|$|Analog-to-digital {{converters}} play {{an essential}} role in modern RF receiver design. Conventional Nyquist converters require analog components that are precise andHighly immune to noise and interference. In contrast, oversampling converters can be implemented using simple and high-tolerance analog components. Moreover,Sampling at high frequency eliminates the need for abrupt cutoffs in the analog antialiasing filters. A technique of noise shaping is used in Ó-Ä converters in addition to oversampling to achieve a high-resolution conversion. A significant advantage of the method is that analog signals are converted using simple and high-tolerance analog circuits, usually a 1 -bit comparator, and analog signal processing circuits having a precision that is usually much less than the resolution of the overall converter. In this paper, the design technique for a low-cost first order narrow band sigma-delta modulator in a standard 0. 9 ìm CMOS technology is described. This circuitry performs the function of an analog-to-digital converter.

For large circuits, gradient computation can be the bottleneck in the optimization procedure. Traditionally, {{when the number of}} measurements is large relative to the number of tunable parameters, the direct method [2] is used to repeatedly solve the associated sensitivity circuit to obtain all the necessary gradients. Likewise, when the parameters outnumber the measurements, the adjoint method [1] is employed to solve the adjoint circuit repeatedly for each measurement to compute the sensitivities.
