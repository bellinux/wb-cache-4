40|$|Small-cell {{networks}} {{have been proposed}} {{to meet the demand}} of ever growing mobile data traffic. One of the prominent challenges faced by small-cell networks is the lack of sufficient backhaul capacity to connect small-cell base stations (small-BSs) to the core network. We exploit the effective application layer semantics of both spatial and temporal locality to reduce the backhaul traffic. Specifically, small-BSs are <b>equipped</b> with <b>storage</b> <b>facility</b> to cache contents requested by users. As the cache hit ratio increases, most of the users' requests can be satisfied locally without incurring traffic over the backhaul. To make informed caching decisions, the mobility patterns of users must be carefully considered as users might frequently migrate from one small cell to another. We study the issue of mobility-aware content caching, which is formulated into an optimization problem with the objective to maximize the caching utility. As the problem is NP-complete, we develop a polynomial-time heuristic solution termed MobiCacher with bounded approximation ratio. We also conduct trace-based simulations to evaluate the performance of MobiCacher, which show that MobiCacher yields better caching utility than existing solutions.

5|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the mission range and flight time for Vulcan operations, in-flight refuelling capabilities were added in 1959 onwards; several Valiant bombers were refurbished as tankers to refuel the Vulcans. Continuous airborne patrols proved untenable, however, and the refuelling mechanisms across the Vulcan fleet fell into disuse in the 1960s. Both Vulcans and the other V-force aircraft routinely visited the Far East, in particular Singapore, where a fully <b>equipped</b> nuclear weapons <b>storage</b> <b>facility</b> had been constructed in 1959. During the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation Britain planned to deploy three squadrons of V-bomber aircraft and 48 Red Beard tactical nuclear weapons to the region; although this was ultimately decided against, Vulcans trained in the region for both conventional and nuclear missions. Britain regularly deployed Vulcans to the Far East {{as a part of}} their contribution to SEATO operations, often to test the defenses of friendly nations in joint exercises. In the early 1970s, the RAF decided to permanently deploy two squadrons of Vulcans overseas in the Near East Air Force Bomber Wing, based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus; the Vulcans were withdrawn as Cypriot intercommunal violence intensified in the mid-1970s.|$|R

40|$|Electricity from {{solar thermal}} power plants is {{environmentally}} friendly, it helps to protect the climate and to save fossil resources. If the {{solar thermal power}} plants are <b>equipped</b> with thermal <b>storage</b> <b>facilities,</b> they are capable to deliver power even at times without solar radiation. Though the costs {{of this kind of}} solar electricity are lower than those from photovoltaic cells, they cannot compete with the generation costs from fossil power plants today. The ECOSTAR study shows {{that it is possible to}} overcome this drawback. This study was partly financed by the European Union and conducted by research organisations from Germany, Spain, France, Israel, Switzerland and Russia. The Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e. V. (DLR) was the project leader and the VGB PowerTech e. V. was also involved, particularly by performing an independent assessment of the results. Seven different solar thermal technologies for electricity production have been investigated within the study. The starting point was the definition of 7 reference systems, describing today’s state-of-the-art and cost. Technical improvements and innovations for the different technologies have been analysed in terms of their impact on system efficiency, investment costs as well as operating and maintenance costs. An unexpected result was that the innovation driven cost reduction potential of all systems is in the range of 30 - 40...|$|R
