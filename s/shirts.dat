The 1936 cup final was the fourth occasion such a badge was worn. Sheffield United also wore crested red and white <b>shirts,</b> their vertical stripe design.|$|E
5|$|Juventus {{have played}} {{in black and white}} striped <b>shirts,</b> with white shorts, {{sometimes}} black shorts since 1903. Originally, they played in pink <b>shirts</b> with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest <b>shirts,</b> but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them. Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new <b>shirts</b> in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped <b>shirts</b> to Turin. Juventus have worn the <b>shirts</b> ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.|$|E
5|$|Albion players – {{along with}} those of other Football League teams – first wore numbers on the back of their <b>shirts</b> in the {{abandoned}} season of 1939–40, and names on the back of their <b>shirts</b> from 1999–2000. Red numbers were added to the side of Albion players' shorts in 1969.|$|E

5|$|Football kit {{has evolved}} {{significantly}} {{since the early}} days of the sport when players typically wore thick cotton <b>shirts,</b> knickerbockers and heavy rigid leather boots. In the twentieth century, boots became lighter and softer, shorts were worn at a shorter length, and advances in clothing manufacture and printing allowed <b>shirts</b> to be made in lighter synthetic fibres with increasingly colourful and complex designs. With the rise of advertising in the 20th century, sponsors' logos began to appear on <b>shirts,</b> and replica strips were made available for fans to purchase, generating significant amounts of revenue for clubs.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} club's history, Hull {{have worn}} black and amber <b>shirts</b> with black shorts. These black and amber colours are where Hull's nickname, The Tigers, {{originated}} from. However, in the club's first match against Notts County in 1904, white <b>shirts</b> were worn, with black shorts and black socks. During their first season in the League, Hull wore black and amber striped <b>shirts</b> and black shorts, which they continued to wear until the Second World War {{with the exception of}} the 1935–36 season, in which they wore sky blue <b>shirts.</b> Following the end of the Second World War, Hull spent another season wearing sky blue, but changed to plain amber <b>shirts,</b> which they wore until the early 1960s, when they swapped back to stripes.|$|E

5|$|Andover's {{traditional}} {{strip of}} red and black stripes was worn {{for the vast majority}} of their history. This was changed to red and black quarters in 1950 and remained so until 1957 when the club reverted to the traditional stripes. When promotion to the Southern League was gained in 1972, the team's colours were changed, this time to red with a single white stripe. This kit was worn until 1988, when the familiar red and black stripes were re-introduced. For the 2008–09 season, a plain red kit was introduced to commemorate the club's 125th anniversary—this was worn for the first time in the pre-season friendly against Salisbury City. The last away kit worn by the team was yellow and black <b>shirts</b> with white shorts. However, various combinations have been worn in recent years, such as white <b>shirts</b> with blue sleeves and blue shorts, and tangerine <b>shirts</b> with white shorts.|$|E

Like those of most other major football clubs, Arsenal's <b>shirts</b> have featured sponsors' logos since the 1980s; sponsors include JVC (1982–1999), Sega (1999–2002), O2 (2002–2006), and Emirates (from 2006).|$|E
5|$|As both Manchester United and Bayern Munich {{traditionally}} wore red {{as their}} primary kit colour, UEFA regulations would normally have required both teams to wear their change kits. However, the two clubs felt {{it would have been}} a shame for neither to wear their traditional colours, and they agreed to toss a coin to see who would have first choice. Manchester United won the toss and therefore wore their usual European colours of red <b>shirts,</b> white shorts and white socks, while Bayern wore silver <b>shirts,</b> shorts and socks, all with maroon trim.|$|E

The primary school uniform for boys is a blue batik <b>shirt</b> and dark blue shorts, and for girls is a blue batik short-sleeved dress or culottes. As for pre-school, white/navy socks are required. For secondary school (years 7-11), the batik <b>shirt</b> is replaced with a light blue <b>shirt</b> for both boys and girls. Girls wear a navy skirt or shorts, while boys wear navy shorts or trousers to compliment the blue <b>shirt.</b> For Year 12/13 students, a white <b>shirt</b> replaces the blue <b>shirt.</b>|$|R
5|$|City have {{previously}} worn three other badges on their <b>shirts,</b> {{prior to their}} current badge which was implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the current badge, inside a circle bearing {{the name of the}} club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced {{the lower half of the}} shield with the red rose of Lancashire. On occasions when Manchester City plays in a major cup final, the usual badge has not been used; instead <b>shirts</b> bearing a badge of the arms of the City of Manchester are used, as a symbol of pride in representing the city of Manchester at a major event. This practice originates from a time when the players' <b>shirts</b> did not normally bear a badge of any kind, but has continued throughout the history of the club. For the 2011 FA Cup Final, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' <b>shirts.</b>|$|E

5|$|England have {{typically}} worn all-white <b>shirts,</b> white shorts with navy and white socks. The emblem on the <b>shirts</b> {{is a red}} rose, rather than the Plantagenet Three Lions displayed on the <b>shirts</b> of the England football and cricket teams. The strip is manufactured by Canterbury and O2 is the shirt sponsor. The change strip is normally red, although prior {{to the introduction of}} the red strip, navy blue was used and was reintroduced for the 2016-17 season. Purple was used as the change strip as of the 2009 autumn internationals, reflecting the traditional colour of the original England track-suits from the 1960s, 70s and 80s. For the 2011 Rugby World Cup the change kit was black.|$|E
50|$|A V-neck T-shirt has a V-shaped {{neckline}}, {{as opposed}} to the round neckline of the more common crew neck <b>shirt</b> (also called a U-neck). V-necks were introduced so that the neckline of the <b>shirt</b> does not stand out when an outer <b>shirt</b> is worn over it, thus reducing or eliminating the visible cloth above the outer <b>shirt</b> of a crew neck <b>shirt.</b>|$|R
50|$|A crop top (also cropped top, belly <b>shirt,</b> half <b>shirt,</b> midriff <b>shirt,</b> midriff top, tummy top, short <b>shirt,</b> and cutoff <b>shirt)</b> is a top, {{the lower}} part of which is high enough to expose the waist, navel, or some of the midriff.

50|$|Mohom is a Lanna word.

The original is white cotton <b>shirt</b> called “Hadook shirt”.|$|R
5|$|Footballers {{generally}} wear identifying {{numbers on}} the backs of their <b>shirts.</b> Originally a team of players wore numbers from 1 to 11, corresponding roughly to their playing positions, but at the professional level this has generally been superseded by squad numbering, whereby each player in a squad is allocated a fixed number for the duration of a season. Professional clubs also usually display players' surnames or nicknames on their <b>shirts,</b> above (or, infrequently, below) their squad numbers.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Rovers ran an April Fools' joke {{on their}} {{official}} website, {{stating that the}} team's new away strip would be all pink. Although this {{was intended to be}} a joke, a number of fans petitioned the club to get the kit made for real, and also suggested that funds raised through the sale of the pink <b>shirts</b> should be donated to a breast cancer charity. Although the pink <b>shirts</b> were never used in a competitive fixture, they were worn for a pre-season friendly against Plymouth Argyle in 2006.|$|E
