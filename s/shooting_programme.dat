The first females joined the cadet corps in the 1970s to 1980s. The Cadet Corps has a pledge and also a song. It started with 3 normal units but today has expanded to 22. These units are grouped into Zones. There are also a band, sea cadet and medical units along with a <b>shooting</b> <b>programme.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{its name}} indicates, {{this is one}} of the {{disciplines}} which form part of the <b>shooting</b> <b>programme</b> at the Olympic Games. A trench in front of the shooting stands conceals 15 traps arranged in five groups of three. Shooters take turns to shoot at a target each, before moving in a clockwise direction to the next stand in the line. Targets for each shooter are thrown immediately upon his call and are selected by a shooting scheme (program) that ensures all competitors receive exactly the same target selection, but in an unpredictable randomised order to the extent that there will be one straight, two left and two right targets for each stand from any one of the three traps directly in front of him/her; guessing which one is next is impossible unless the shooter is on his/her last five targets.|$|E
40|$|Shooting {{is widely}} used to reduce the abundances of {{terrestrial}} wildlife populations, but there is concern about the animal welfare outcomes ('humaneness') of these programmes. Management agencies require methods for assessing the animal welfare outcomes of terrestrial wildlife shooting programmes. We identified four key issues in previous studies assessing the animal welfare outcomes of shooting programmes: (i) biased sampling strategies; (ii) no direct ante mortem observations; (iii) absence of quantifiable parameters for benchmarking; and (iv) no evaluation of explanatory variables that may cause adverse welfare outcomes. We used methods that address these issues to assess the welfare outcomes of a European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) <b>shooting</b> <b>programme</b> in south-eastern Australia. An independent observer collected ante mortem (distance, timing and outcome of each shot fired) and post mortem (locations of bullet wounds) data. The ante mortem data were used to estimate three critical animal welfare parameters: apparent time to death (ATTD); instantaneous death rate (IDR); and wounding rate (WR). The post mortem data were {{used to evaluate the}} location of bullet wounds relative to the Australian national standard operating procedure (SOP). For rabbits, the mean IDR was 0. 60, ATTD was 12 s and WR was 0. 12. A large proportion of rabbits (0. 75) were shot in the cranium or thorax, as required by the SOP. Logistic regression indicated that the proportion of rabbits wounded and missed increased with shooting distance. Hence, reducing shooting distances would increase the humaneness of European rabbit shooting programmes. Our approach enables the animal welfare outcomes of terrestrial shooting programmes to be independently quantified...|$|E

50|$|Roots & Shoots {{began with}} 16 {{students}} {{who were interested in}} animals and environment conservation. However, they realised they were not able to obtain sufficient support and resources they would need from school. They, therefore, went to meet Dr. Goodall on her front porch in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in 1991. After a deep conversation, they returned to school and began to look for like-minded students to realise their goals. The Roots & <b>Shoots</b> <b>programme</b> was then born. Now there are more than 4500 groups around the world in over 70 countries, including more than 7 countries in Asia, such as Hong Kong, China, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Korea and Malaysia.|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on how Chinese media {{industries}} have sought to expand into new territories, identifying several mechanisms by which Chinese cultural and media products are traded and consumed: namely finished content, co-productions, formats and online platforms. The article also considers the value of overseas location <b>shooting</b> for domestic <b>programmes</b> and acquisition of international media assets. The key idea that is discussed in regards to China's outward-bound trade mission is know-how. In respect to media production, producers tend to opt for risk avoidance rather than creative exploration. Consequently, Chinese producers, investors and practitioners are deficient in knowledge of international markets and audience perceptions because the government has chosen to intervene, select and guide Chinese products. The article suggests this is gradually changing...|$|R
40|$|Red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus are an {{important}} game species in the United Kingdom, with many areas of heather moorland managed specifically to produce them for driven shooting. In order to effectively manage red grouse populations {{it is important to}} have an understanding of their population dynamics and to determine which of the vital rates most effect population growth and recovery and whether these parameters can be influenced by management activities. The focus of my research was to provide a greater understanding of the respective roles of juvenile dispersal, heather management and mortality causes in red grouse population dynamics at a landscape scale in northern England. The study was undertaken between 1999 and 2005 and encompassed four privately owned grouse moors, covering some 113 km(^ 2) of heather dominated moorland. Central to my research was the ability to accurately and efficiently survey the distribution and abundance of red grouse across the study area. To facilitate this I evaluated a distance sampling method to survey red grouse across the study area pre-breeding in spring and post-breeding in summer. The distance sampling technique proved a reliable, repeatable and practical method for extensive surveys of red grouse. Grouse distribution data were used to construct spatial patterns of grouse abundance at a moor scale using a geostatistical interpolation technique. Rotational heather burning is practised by grouse moor managers to create a mosaic of heather ages which provide food, shelter and nesting habitats for red grouse. To assess the spatial and temporal effects of heather burning on grouse, I used an earth observation technique, using satellite remote sensing to map the habitat mosaic across all four study moors in 2000. Temporal effects of heather burning, from 2000 to 2005 were studied on one moor, with annual heather burning mapped annually. Dispersal is {{an important}} element of population dynamics which influences population growth and spread, gene flow and disease transmission. I used radio telemetry to investigate the timing, frequency and distances of dispersal in juvenile red grouse. Dispersal distance differed between sexes, with juvenile females dispersing on average 861 m (± 120 SE) compared to 343 m (± 31 SE) recorded in males. Population growth did not appear to be limited by dispersal and abundance increased until the density dependent effect of the parasitic nematode worm Trichostrongyle tenuis caused a population crash. On the study moors, grouse moor management resulted in rapid population growth with population oscillations caused by density dependent strongylosis induced crashes. The main cause of mortality was found to be shooting and to dampen population oscillations, modified <b>shooting</b> <b>programmes</b> to limit population growth in conjunction with parasite control measures should be adopted to better manage grouse populations.

40|$|The present paper {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} a <b>shoot</b> training <b>programme</b> with a reduced hoop diameter (0. 35 m) rim on kinematics and performance of basketball free-throws. Eighteen young male basketball players were divided into control (CG, n = 9) and experimental (EG, n = 9) groups. Both groups undertook a 10 -week training programme comprising two training sessions per week. Under fatigued conditions, each participant shot 150 free-throws in each training session, with the CG using a standard rim, and the EG a smaller rim. All other training was identical between groups. Ball release parameters, player 2 ̆ 7 s kinematics and mean of successful free-throws (out of 150 attempts) were determined for each participant, before and after completion of the training programme. Following training, a significant increase (P < 0. 05) in ball release angle, speed and height and in shoulder joint angle at release (P < 0. 01) was observed for the EG. Both the CG (P < 0. 001) and the EG (P < 0. 0001) showed {{an increase in the number}} of successful free throws, although the increase was greater (P < 0. 05) for the EG (22. 7 ± 6. 4 free throws) than for the CG (14. 6 ± 7. 8 free throws). We conclude that training with a reduced rim significantly improves free-throw performance in young basketball players...|$|R
50|$|The {{making of}} the film was {{documented}} by the Man Alive (BBC) programme, in an episode about the British sex and horror film industry of the mid-seventies, titled ‘Man Alive: Xploitation’. The programme shows producer Bachoo Sen and director Trevor Wrenn trying to cast the role of ‘an English rose who can ride a horse’ (this is presumably {{the role played by}} Heather Deeley in the film). A screening of the dailies in the programme shows the film to have been shot in the ‘Italian style’ of having the director talk to the performers whilst they act, meaning the film would have to be later re-dubbed. The programme also reveals the film’s writer ‘Jon York’, was actually a student at York University, and is seen writing the script in the University’s library. The film is referred to by its shooting titles The Will and The Willing Sex during the <b>programme.</b> <b>Shooting</b> started on 8 February 1975, and the film was released on 8 May 1975. The house used in the film was at the time owned by a famous racing driver.|$|R
500|$|Val Guest {{was hired}} to direct the film. He began his career co-writing comedies such as Oh, Mr Porter! (1937) and Ask a Policeman (1939) before moving into {{directing}} with Miss London Ltd. (1943). His first directing job for Hammer was on Life with the Lyons (1954) {{and he went on}} to direct their first two colour features: The Men of Sherwood Forest (1954) and Break in the Circle (1954). Guest had little interest in science fiction and was unenthusiastic about directing the film; he reluctantly took copies of Nigel Kneale's television scripts with him on holiday in Tangiers and only began reading them after being teased for his [...] "ethereal" [...] attitude by his wife, Yolande Donlan. Impressed by what he read and pleased to be offered the opportunity to break away from directing comedy films, he took the job. In his approach to directing the film, Guest sought to make [...] "a slightly wild story more believable" [...] by creating a [...] "science fact" [...] film, shot [...] "as though <b>shooting</b> a special <b>programme</b> for the BBC or something". Influenced by Elia Kazan's Panic in the Streets (1950), Guest employed a cinéma vérité style, making extensive use of hand-held camera, even on set, an unusual technique for the time which horrified several of the technicians employed on the film. To inject pace and add further realism into the story, Guest directed his actors to deliver their lines rapid-fire and to overlap the dialogue. A meticulous planner, he created storyboards for every shot and mounted them on a blackboard so as to brief the crew for each day's scenes. As a consequence, some members of the crew found Guest's approach to be too mechanical.|$|R
