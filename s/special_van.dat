40|$|The {{creation}} of van der Waals heterostructures {{based on a}} graphene monolayer and other two-dimensional crystals has attracted great interest because atomic registry of the two-dimensional crystals can modify the electronic spectra and properties of graphene. Twisted graphene bilayer {{can be viewed as}} a <b>special</b> <b>van</b> der Waals structure composed of two mutual misoriented graphene layers, where the sublayer graphene not only plays the role of a substrate, but also acts as an equivalent role as the top graphene layer in the structure. Here we report the electronic spectra of slightly twisted graphene bilayers studied by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Our experiment demonstrates that twist-induced van Hove singularities are ubiquitously present for rotation angles theta less than about 3. 5 o, corresponding to moiré-pattern periods D longer than 4 nm. However, they totally vanish for theta > 5. 5 o (D < 2. 5 nm). Such a behavior indicates that the continuum models, which capture moiré-pattern periodicity more accurately at small rotation angles, are no longer applicable at large rotation angles.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of electromagnetic hyperbolic dispersion surfaces in <b>special</b> <b>van</b> der Waals bonded solids, such as hexagonal boron nitride and bismuth selenide (a topological insulator), opens intriguing possibilities for strongly modifying quantum and thermal interactions. However, open problems exist {{in defining the}} field fluctuations that govern light-matter interactions inside natural hyperbolic media. Here, we {{lay the foundation for}} analytically categorizing these field fluctuations. Specifically, we show that the central characteristics of hyperbolic response are determined by a coupling of longitudinal and transverse field fluctuations that can not occur in conventional media. This allows for an unambiguous separation of photonic and polaritonic fluctuations and a quantification of the field enhancement set only by material absorption. We apply our results to explore quantum optical sum rules for modified spontaneous emission enhancement, and thermal energy density in hexagonal boron nitride and bismuth selenide. Most notably, we find that while the sum rule is satisfied, it does not constrain the enhancement of quantum and thermal properties inside a hyperbolic medium. We also show that both hexagonal boron nitride and bismuth selenide possess broad spectral regions where polaritonic fluctuations are over 120 times larger (and over 800 times larger along specific angular directions) than vacuum fluctuations.
