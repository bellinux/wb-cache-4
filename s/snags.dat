5|$|The repentant Carl goes outside, {{only to see}} Russell sailing {{off with}} some {{balloons}} and the propulsive leaf blower to try to rescue Kevin. By throwing out his furniture and keepsakes, Carl manages to lighten the house enough to follow. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl manages to board the dirigible, tether the house, and free Russell and Kevin. Dug inadvertently saddles Alpha with his cone of shame and becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz pursues them around the airship, trapping Dug, Kevin and Russell inside Carl's house. Carl lures Kevin back onto the airship, with Dug and Russell clinging to her back. Muntz leaps after them, but <b>snags</b> his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death. The house then descends out of sight through the clouds.|$|E
5|$|With Panay dead, the {{situation}} in Panau becomes a free-for-all as foreign nations scramble to claim the oil. Russia, China and Japan send a fleet of supertankers to Panau, and the U.S. begins scrambling its military forces to defend the island. Rico is tasked with holding off the supertankers until reinforcements arrive, but a nuclear submarine suddenly surfaces. Rico investigates the submarine and finds Panay, alive but injured. Although Panay fires nuclear missiles at Russia, China, Japan and the U.S., his clothing <b>snags</b> {{on one of the}} missiles and he goes up with it. In pursuit, Rico grapples onto the missile; the men battle in midair as he disarms each missile.|$|E
5|$|Flowers and coins, {{as well as}} stars, are {{scattered}} about the game's stages. These are totaled {{at the end of}} each stage and a score is given depending how many of each were collected (a maximum of 30 stars, 20 red coins and 5 flowers). Sufficiently high scores are required to unlock one of the two sets of secret levels. (the other set being unlocked upon completing the game, similar to the GBA remake of the original game) Special character coins are also introduced. Missing from the game are the power-ups of sorts — like the ability to spit seeds by eating watermelons — which were present in the original. The fire breathing ability is retained though: Yoshi can use it when he <b>snags</b> a torch or fireball with his tongue. This allows him to shoot streams of fire up to three times. Keys found in the stages unlock mini-games and doors that would be closed otherwise.|$|E
40|$|<b>SnAg</b> {{nanoparticles}} (<b>SnAg</b> NPs) {{were prepared}} by wet synthesis. The chemical {{composition of the}} <b>SnAg</b> NPs was obtained by inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry. The prepared fine powder samples were characterized by electron microscopic technique (SEM) and thermal analysis (DSC). The nanoparticles with different size were obtained. The size dependent melting point depression (MPD) of the <b>SnAg</b> NPs was determined experimentally. The size dependent phase diagram of the <b>SnAg</b> alloy was also calculated using CALPHAD method, which has been extended to describe the surface energy of <b>SnAg</b> nanoparticles. The same approach was used for <b>SnAg</b> eutectic MPD calculations. The own experimental and theoretical results were compared with the data of the other authors. The satisfactory agreement was found...|$|R
30|$|Choosing a <b>snag</b> {{persistence}} {{model will}} depend on the intended use and tolerance of accuracy and cost. The FFE-FVS models over-predicted <b>snag</b> longevity for sugar pine, white fir, and yellow pine, and under-predicted <b>snag</b> persistence for incense-cedar at year 10. The large over-prediction of yellow pine <b>snag</b> persistence by FFE-FVS suggests that caution is needed when using this software to estimate <b>snag</b> longevity after fire. The covariate models were more accurate than FFE-FVS, but not as accurate in predicting overall <b>snag</b> persistence as the time-only models. This is due to the increased difficulty in modeling behavior at the individual <b>snag</b> level rather than at the stand level. Only 12 incense-cedars had fallen {{by the end of the}} observation period. Although this is enough to develop a reasonable model, in future studies, incense-cedar should be followed for a longer period of time to assess the accuracy of these models past 10  years.|$|R

5|$|Many birds call Adams home or a {{stopover}} {{on their}} migration routes. Songbirds include three species of chickadee, two kinglets, several thrushes, warblers, sparrows, and finches. One unique songbird {{to the high}} elevations is the gray-crowned rosy finch, who can be found far up the mountain, well above the tree line. Raptors {{that live in the}} forest and meadows include Accipiters, red-tailed hawks, golden and bald eagles, ospreys, great horned owls, and falcons. The many <b>snags</b> around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the hairy woodpecker, downy woodpecker, and white-headed woodpecker. Jays such as the Steller's jay and gray jay are common and the gray jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the Clark's nutcracker with its distinctive call. Swallows and swifts are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. Common mergansers and several other species of water birds can be found on many of the lakes as well. The American dipper with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several grouse species, the sooty, spruce, and ruffed grouse and the white-tailed ptarmigan, call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.|$|E
5|$|Threats to Bridgeoporus nobilissimus include {{extirpation}} {{of known}} and unknown habitats by logging, fire, or other disturbances, and forestry practices {{that lead to}} the loss of large-diameter Abies procera and Abies amabilis trees and large-diameter stumps and <b>snags</b> in managed forests. Due to the scarcity of its mature tree hosts, B.nobilissimus was listed in 1995 as an endangered species by the Oregon Natural Heritage Program, making it the first of the fungi to be listed as endangered by any private or public agency in the United States. It is the sole fungus in category A of the survey and management guidelines for fungi under the Northwest Forest Plan, meaning pre-disturbance surveys and site management are needed before developing areas known to harbor the fungus. There were 13 known sites with the fungus before 1998; extensive surveying in the Pacific Northwest increased this number to 103 sites by 2006. Although it is infrequently observed, the fungus is more abundant than fruit body appearance indicates. Using genetic markers to detect the fungus mycelium in hosts, researchers found that B.nobilissimus was present at low to moderate levels and widespread in forest stands containing at least a single visible fruit body. It was detected in trees of all sizes, and in species not previously thought to harbor the fungus. B.nobilissimus may require decades of mycelial growth in its host before fruit body production is initiated. The fungus has not been successively grown in vitro despite several attempts.|$|E
25|$|The American rivers {{were still}} {{difficult}} to navigate, however, {{because of the}} presence of dead wood called <b>snags,</b> s, or log jams.|$|E
50|$|Other {{things can}} also <b>snag</b> on various objects. A fishing line can <b>snag</b> on a tree, for example. Similarly, a dead tree is also called a <b>snag,</b> {{as it can}} catch boaters (or hikers) off-guard. The term is also used colloquially to {{describe}} any unexpected circumstance which causes a delay in a project or any given situation.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{undercooling}} of commercially available SnAgCu solder alloys by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC - rate 10 K/min). The results for solder spheres of 0 260 μm (free standing, no interfacial reaction) show that Sn-based solder alloys (investigated alloys Sn 99. 9; SnCu 0. 5; SnCu 0. 7; SnCu 1. 2; <b>SnAg</b> 3. 0; <b>SnAg</b> 4. 0; <b>SnAg</b> 3. 0 Cu 0. 5; <b>SnAg</b> 3. 0 Cu 1. 2; <b>SnAg</b> 4. 0 Cu 1. 2; <b>SnAg</b> 3. 8 Cu 0. 7) solidify with significant undercooling ranging from 16. 9 K to 81. 7 K {{in the present}} study. It is also shown that undercooling can strongly vary from alloy to alloy and even during subsequent measurements of the same sample. Furthermore {{the results indicate that}} undercooling increases with decreasing sample size, which has {{to be taken into account}} if the interconnect size becomes smaller...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Snagging,</b> the {{indiscriminate}} {{taking of}} fish using weighted hooks that are {{ripped through the}} water with quick jerking motions, was controversially outlawed on the Salmon River in the early 1990s. It had previously been argued that <b>snagging</b> was ethical due to the difficulty in enticing Chinook and coho salmon to strike, as these fish die after spawning and do not feed once they enter the river. However, proponents of the <b>snagging</b> ban noted that the river also contained several species that survive beyond their spawning seasons, such as steelhead, brown trout and Atlantic salmon; <b>snagging</b> could not possibly avoid impacting these fish as well. In addition, <b>snagging</b> opponents claimed that the practice was unethical as it violated the doctrine of [...] "fair chase", and noted that <b>snagging</b> was associated with both injuries and problematic behavior, such as littering, the targeting of fish merely to harvest their eggs for profit, and fistfights among anglers.|$|R
40|$|Background: Treatment of {{cutaneous}} wounds with poly-N-acetyl-glucosamine nanofibers (<b>sNAG)</b> {{results in}} increased kinetics of wound closure in diabetic animal models, which {{is due in}} part to increased expression of several cytokines, growth factors, and innate immune activation. Defensins are also important for wound healing and anti-microbial activities. Therefore, we tested whether <b>sNAG</b> nanofibers induce defensin expression resulting in bacterial clearance. Methodology: The role of <b>sNAG</b> in defensin expression was examined using immunofluoresence microscopy, pharmacological inhibition, and shRNA knockdown in vitro. The ability of <b>sNAG</b> treatment to induce defensin expression and bacterial clearance in WT and AKT 12 / 2 mice was carried out using immunofluoresent microscopy and tissue gram staining. Neutralization, using an antibody directed against b-defensin 3, was utilized to determine if the antimicrobial properties of <b>sNAG</b> are dependent on the induction of defensin expression. Conclusions/Findings: <b>sNAG</b> treatment causes increased expression of both a- and b-type defensins in endothelial cells and b-type defensins in keratinocytes. Pharmacological inhibition and shRNA knockdown implicates Akt 1 in sNAG-dependent defensin expression in vitro, an activity also shown in an in vivo wound healing model. Importantly, <b>sNAG</b> treatment results in increased kinetics of wound closure in wild type animals. <b>sNAG</b> treatment decreases bacterial infection of cutaneous wounds infected with Staphylococcus aureus in wild type control animals but not in similarly treated Akt 1 null animals...|$|R
25|$|Giant helium {{balloons}} of Charlie Brown and Snoopy {{have long}} been a feature in the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.

25|$|Helicopters {{dragging}} a plow to overturn or detonate mines. This has {{the problem of}} bringing down the helicopter when the plow <b>snags</b> onto objects such as large rocks, but has been corrected by use of pressure-sensitive plow rakes which release when over-pressured. This does, however, affect its effectiveness as mines planted in hard ground or near rocks will not be detonated.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{decompression}} buoys: Sub-surface deployable buoys {{allow the}} diver to {{signal that the}} ascent has begun, and indicate {{the position of the}} diver to people on the surface, often the crew of the boat which must pick the divers up after the dive. Deployment skills include controlled inflation, paying out line in a way they avoids <b>snags</b> and jams, maintaining appropriate depth control during the deployment and control of line tension during ascent.|$|E

25|$|Loss of steamboats by collision, fire, or river {{obstacles}} (<b>snags)</b> {{was well}} understood, but boiler explosions seemed arbitrary and mysterious. Immediately {{after the loss}} of the Lucy Walker, many newspapers began to speculate on the cause or causes of the explosion. One paper opined that a faulty force pump and low water level in the boiler was the cause. Another newspaper reported qualms about reckless behavior of the boat's officers or shoddy construction of the boilers. Later there was speculation that steamboat racing might have contributed to the disaster.|$|E
25|$|Wakodahatchee Wetlands is a {{wetlands}} park {{open to the}} public. Facilities {{include a}} three-quarter mile boardwalk that crosses between open water pond areas, emergent marsh areas, shallow shelves, and islands with shrubs and <b>snags</b> to foster nesting and roosting. The site {{is part of the}} South section of the Great Florida Birding Trail and offers many opportunities to observe birds in their natural habitats. Over 151 species of birds have been spotted inside the park, including pied-billed grebe, snowy egrets, and black-bellied whistling ducks. The park is also home to turtles, alligators, rabbits, frogs, and raccoons.|$|E

50|$|When a <b>snag</b> {{occurs in}} certain fine {{textiles}} like pantyhose, {{it is called}} a run. This is because the <b>snag</b> breaks at least one fibre, causing the knit to come undone in a line which runs up {{the grain of the}} fabric.|$|R
25|$|Another {{important}} factor relating to roost suitability is tree condition. Indiana bats prefer dead or dying trees with exfoliating bark. The amount of exfoliating bark present {{on a tree}} seems to be insignificant. Indiana bats show an affinity for very large trees that receive lots of sunlight. Typically, Indiana bats roost in <b>snags,</b> but a few species of live trees are also utilized. Live roost trees are usually shagbark hickory, silver maple, and white oak. Shagbark hickories make excellent alternate roosts throughout the Indiana bats' range due to their naturally exfoliating bark. Although Indiana bats primarily roost under loose bark, a small fraction roost in tree cavities.|$|E
25|$|Beam {{trawlers}} – use sturdy outrigger booms for towing a beam trawl, one warp {{on each side}}. Double-rig beam trawlers can tow {{a separate}} trawl {{on each side of}} the trawler. Beam trawling is used in the flatfish and shrimp fisheries in the North Sea. They are medium-sized and high powered vessels, towing gear at speeds up to 8 knots. To avoid the boat capsizing if the trawl <b>snags</b> on the sea floor, winch brakes can be installed, along with safety release systems in the boom stays. The engine power of bottom trawlers is also restricted to 2000 HP (1472 KW) for further safety.|$|E
25|$|Several {{changes were}} made for the game's North American release, which are {{not found in the}} Japanese and PAL {{versions}} of the game. The most notable change revolves around Stage 6, where Lammy no longer dies and goes to Hell, but instead <b>snags</b> her belt on a door handle and winds up flung onto a volcanic island. This results in some different graphics for Lammy during this stage, as well as the following cutscene, as well as a slight change in lyrics in Stage 1 for continuity. Lyrics were also changed in various stages, such as Stage 5, which features a lumberjack. Lines were changed in this stage to avoid themes of deforestation.|$|E
