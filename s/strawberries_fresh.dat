40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{is working}} towards future long {{duration}} manned space flights beyond low earth orbit. The duration of these missions {{may be as}} long as 2. 5 years and will likely include a stay on a lunar or planetary surface. The primary goal of the Advanced Food System in these long duration exploratory missions is to provide the crew with a palatable, nutritious, and safe food system while minimizing volume, mass, and waste. Vegetable crops can provide the crew with added nutrition and variety. These crops do not require any cooking or food processing prior to consumption. The vegetable crops, unlike prepackaged foods, will provide bright colors, textures (crispy), and fresh aromas. Ten vegetable crops have been identified for possible use in long duration missions. They are lettuce, spinach, carrot, tomato, green onion, radish, bell pepper, <b>strawberries,</b> <b>fresh</b> herbs, and cabbage. Whether these crops are grown on a transit vehicle (e. g., International Space Station) or on the lunar or planetary surface, {{it will be necessary}} to determine how to safely handle the vegetables while maintaining acceptability. Since hydrogen peroxide degrades into water and oxygen and is generally recognized as safe (GRAS), hydrogen peroxide has been recommended as the sanitizer. The objective of th is research is to determine the required effective concentration of hydrogen peroxide. In addition, it will be determined whether the use of hydrogen peroxide, although a viable sanitizer, adversely affects the quality of the vegetables. Vegetables will be dipped in 1 % hydrogen peroxide, 3 % hydrogen peroxide, or 5 % hydrogen peroxide. Treated produce and controls will be stored in plastic bags at 5 C for up to 14 days. Sensory, color, texture, and total plate count will be measured. The effect on several vegetables including lettuce, radish, tomato and strawberries has been completed. Although each vegetable reacts to hydrogen peroxide differently, the data suggest that 5 % hydrogen peroxide reduces the shelf life of the vegetable. A dip of either 1 % or 3 % hydrogen peroxide helps reduce the microbial total count while not adversely affecting the quality of the vegetable...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Fresh produce are an {{important}} component of a healthy diet, yet the last decades an increase was observed in the number of foodborne outbreaks associated with the consumption of fresh produce. Outbreaks included leafy vegetables, sprouted seeds, soft red fruit and melons. Since strawberries are {{an important}} fruit in Belgium and little information is available about microbial risks and how to control these risks, strawberries were sampled during primary production (6 farms: 3 open field cultivation and 3 hydroponic cultivation), processing (1 company) and trade (2 companies). Materials and methods: At farm level, samples were taken of strawberries, water, hands and substrate/soil during 4 visits, whereas at the processing level, wash water, <b>strawberries</b> (<b>fresh,</b> cut and in fruit salad), hands and contact surfaces were sampled during 6 visits. In the case of the trading companies 41 batches of strawberries were sampled. The samples were distributed over strawberry batches coming from Belgium/The Netherlands (20), Spain (13) and Egypt (8). Hands and contact surfaces were analysed for E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae by using a petrifilm and VRBL agar respectively. Strawberries, water and substrate/soil were analysed for E. coli and {{the presence or absence of}} Salmonella spp. and Verocytotoxin producing E. coli (VTEC) by the use of a petrifilm and the GeneDisc Cycler (Multiplex PCR). Results and Discussion: In general, no Salmonella spp. (0 / 201; 95 % CI 0, 00 – 1, 88) or VTEC (0 / 201; 95 % CI 0, 00 – 1, 88) was detected in any of the strawberry samples analysed nor at the level of processing and trade, nor in primary production. Neither was E. coli detected (< 10 /g) as a hygiene indicator in any of the strawberry samples at processing or trade level. In primary production, E. coli was present in 2 strawberry samples (1, 0 x 101 and 9, 8 x 102 cfu/g). Generic E. coli were enumerated in 4 / 57 hand samples (2, 0 ± 1, 5 log cfu/ 25 cm²), 44 / 78 samples of irrigation water (1, 5 ± 1, 1 log cfu/ 100 ml), 4 / 24 soil samples (2, 5 ± 0, 5 log cfu/ 1000 cm²) and 7 / 24 substrate samples (1, 8 ± 1, 3 log cfu/g). Salmonella was not isolated from any of the environmental samples in primary production. On the other hand, 11 / 78 samples of irrigation water and 2 / 24 substrate samples were PCR-positive for VTEC, meaning that stx 1 and/or stx 2 and eae genes were detected. VTEC isolates from this irrigation waters or substrate samples were obtained in 4 out of 13 PCR-positive samples and confirmed as E. coli O 26 (2 x water, 2 x substrate; the 4 isolates from these samples being obtained at one time interval from one farm). After further statistical analysis, it was found that there was a higher probability to find VTEC PCR signals in water in primary production if water sources can receive surface run-off water, are not disinfected or are located adjacent to farm animals. In addition, elevated E. coli numbers are an indicator for the presence of PCR VTEC signals (respectively 0 / 16, 3 / 13 en 8 / 15 samples with 1 - 10, 10 - 100 and ≥ 100 E. coli cfu/ 100 ml, respectively, showed PCR VTEC positive signals) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} methods to measure {{antioxidants}} in botanicals, foods, nutraceuticals and other dietary supplements are increased considerably {{in the last}} ten years. However most techniques require long experimental times and high costs to determine antioxidant capacity of hydrophilic or lipophilic compound in a food mixture. By means of a photochemiluminescence method (PCL), we assessed the Integral Antioxidant Capacity (IAC) which represents the sum of the antioxidant capacity of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants. In this study the IAC of extracts from Adansonia digitatata (i. e. red fiber, fruit pulp and leaves), was assessed in comparison to those deriving from other natural sources of antioxidants (i. e. orange, kiwi, apple and strawberry).

40|$|Antioxidant {{activity}} of apple and <b>strawberry</b> (<b>fresh</b> fruits and purees) was evaluated using different extraction solvent: water, water/acetone, acetone, buffer solution (pH 2) and two different methods of analysis: DPPH· radical scavenging activity and crocin bleaching competition kinetic. The different solvents affected the antioxidant activity and, in particular, extracts having similar {{responses to the}} Folin- Ciocalteau assay showed very different antioxidant activities. The antioxidant {{activity of}} ascorbic acid and some selected phenolic compounds (p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, epicatechin, phloridzin, quercetin, pelargonidin) diluted in the previously considered solvents was tested by both the above mentioned methods of analysis. The solvent showed to influence dramatically the antioxidant activity of the bioactive compounds {{even if it is}} added to the reaction mixture in small amounts. In particular ascorbic acid showed the maximum antioxidant activity in acqueous solution at pH 2 while phenolic compounds showed the maximum antioxidant activity in water and water/acetone solution (respectively for crocin bleaching and DPPH· method) and a very low antioxidant activity at pH 2. Pelargonidin was the only polyphenol whose antioxidant activity was not influenced by the pH of the solution. These results suggests that in order to compare the antioxidant activity of vegetables extracts {{it is important to consider}} the solvent, not only because it could influence the extraction of bioactive compounds but also because it could directly influence their antioxidant activity.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the influence of freezing on the visco-elastic properties of strawberries. Food structure {{plays an important role}} in food quality and functionality. It is important for the consumers to find an identical sensation when they eat a <b>fresh</b> <b>strawberry</b> and when the strawberry is defrosted. The visco-elastic properties of a food product are an indirect measure of its structure. Experimental measurements of these properties may correlate to changes on the physical attributes of the product. In this work, a dynamic mechanical analyser was used to assess changes on loss (E’’) and storage (E’) modulus, applying a compressive test with a Ø 1. 5 cm parallel plate geometry. Strawberries were acquired in a local market and frozen in a blast and fluidized bed freezer at – 30 ºC for 1 hour. Samples were stored at – 30 ºC in freezing chambers. Analyses were performed on <b>fresh</b> <b>strawberries,</b> after freezing and during storage. The samples were cut in small cylinders (1. 5 cm x 1. 5 cm) and left to relax during 1 hour at room temperature. Preliminary tests were performed in order to evaluate the linear visco-elastic region and the loss and storage modulus were determined. A dynamic frequency sweep test was also performed. Results showed that the behaviour of <b>fresh</b> <b>strawberry</b> sample varies significantly when compared with a defrosted sample. The influence of the storage still cannot be evaluated and is currently under study. Overall, it can be concluded that the freezing process greatly influenced the visco-elastic properties of the strawberries...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} growing and {{marketing}} strawberries varies {{throughout the world}} and even within countries. Traditionally New Zealand produces strawberries on a short term cropping system where the plants may be cropped for {{only one or two}} seasons, {{as is the case in}} the Auckland province, or they may be held for three of four years as is common in the South Island. Sale is still based firmly on the local market both in fresh form and as block frozen for processing. Northern areas of New Zealand have developed a sound fresh export trade in punnets particularly to Australian markets and some strawberries are also exported fresh from the South Island later in the season. Strawberries are also exported in block frozen form and in the I. Q. F. (independently quick frozen) form. Latest statistics available 1 are for the 1976 year. Figures for the 1970 year are presented for comparison. The 37. 6 % reduction in production in 6 years corresponds to the 38. 7 % reduction in area. The traditional Australian market for <b>fresh</b> <b>strawberries</b> has reduced by 79 % in 6 years and represents only 40 % of all <b>fresh</b> <b>strawberries</b> exported compared with 77 % in 1970.
