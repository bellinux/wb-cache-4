5|$|It was {{recognized}} {{early on that}} SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between high-voltage power lines and the earth. When a lightning strike to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. Such SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had {{to be placed in}} series with a <b>spark</b> <b>gap.</b> This <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> in a lightning arrester. Gapped SiC lightning arresters were used as lightning-protection tool and sold under GE and Westinghouse brand names, among others. The gapped SiC arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.|$|E
25|$|When {{the voltage}} across the {{capacitor}} reaches the breakdown voltage of the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> (SG) a spark starts, reducing the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> resistance {{to a very}} low value. This completes the primary circuit and current from the capacitor flows through the primary coil (L1). The current flows rapidly {{back and forth between}} the plates of the capacitor through the coil, generating radio frequency oscillating current in the primary circuit at the circuit's resonant frequency.|$|E
50|$|Small <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> {{are very}} common in {{telephone}} switchboards, as the long phone cables are very susceptible to induced surges from lightning strikes. Larger <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> are used to protect power lines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spark</b> <b>gaps</b> {{are also}} used in {{electric}} stove lighters (both external and built-in).|$|R
50|$|<b>Spark</b> <b>gaps</b> are {{essential}} to the functioning of a number of electronic devices.|$|R
25|$|This entire cycle {{takes place}} very rapidly, the {{oscillations}} dying {{out in a}} time of the order of a millisecond. Each spark across the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> produces a pulse of damped sinusoidal high voltage at the output terminal of the coil. Each pulse dies out before the next spark occurs, so the coil generates a string of damped waves, not a continuous sinusoidal voltage. The high voltage from the supply transformer that charges the capacitor is a 50 or 60Hz sine wave. Depending on how the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> is set, usually one or two sparks occur at the peak of each half-cycle of the mains current, so {{there are more than a}} hundred sparks per second. Thus the spark at the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> appears continuous, as do the high voltage streamers from the top of the coil.|$|E
25|$|Tesla {{experimented with}} these, and many other, circuit {{configurations}} (see right). The Tesla coil primary winding, <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> and tank capacitor are connected in series. In each circuit, the AC supply transformer charges the tank capacitor until its voltage {{is sufficient to}} break down the <b>spark</b> <b>gap.</b> The gap suddenly fires, allowing the charged tank capacitor to discharge into the primary winding. Once the gap fires, the electrical behavior of either circuit is identical. Experiments have shown that neither circuit offers any marked performance advantage over the other.|$|E

Additionally, the recorded signals from the scintillation detector, and the energy spectrum received for the examined system are also presented. It is significant that the field distribution related to the shape of the <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> is of key importance for the received measurement data.

25|$|Although some {{applications}} had counterparts using earlier {{technologies such}} as the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> transmitter or mechanical computers, it was {{the invention of the}} vacuum tube that made these technologies widespread and practical.|$|E
25|$|Early radio {{telegraphy}} used <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> and arc transmitters {{as well as}} high-frequency alternators {{running at}} radio frequencies. The coherer was the first means of detecting a radio signal. These, however, lacked the sensitivity to detect weak signals.|$|E
25|$|The best-known {{application}} is the electric cigarette lighter: pressing the button causes a spring-loaded hammer {{to hit a}} piezoelectric crystal, producing a sufficiently high-voltage electric current that flows across a small <b>spark</b> <b>gap,</b> thus heating and igniting the gas. The portable sparkers used to ignite gas stoves work the same way, and many types of gas burners now have built-in piezo-based ignition systems.|$|E
30|$|Schlieren and {{shadowgraph}} light {{sources have}} traditionally included incandescent-filament bulbs, compact arc lamps, <b>spark</b> <b>gaps,</b> and flashlamps [16]. Recently LEDs {{have been added}} to this list [14], entirely replacing the dangerous <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> and providing broadband or monochromatic illumination inexpensively. Best of all, LEDs can be pulsed repeatedly at sub-microsecond intervals, which none of the other available light sources can do. Compact arc lamps, however, still outshine LEDs for high-speed imaging where continuous illumination is required.|$|R

50|$|Advanced {{combustion}} launchers {{may include}} metered propane or calcium carbide (acetylene) injection to ensure proper fueling, chamber fans {{to mix the}} fuel with the air and accelerate venting of the chamber after firing, multiple <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> (<b>spark</b> strips) to decrease combustion time, and high-voltage ignition sources (flyback circuits, stun guns, camera flashes, etc.).|$|R
25|$|A Tesla coil is a radio {{frequency}} oscillator that drives an air-core double-tuned resonant transformer to produce high voltages at low currents. Tesla's original circuits {{as well as}} most modern coils use a simple <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> to excite oscillations in the tuned transformer. More sophisticated designs use transistor or thyristor switches or vacuum tube electronic oscillators to drive the resonant transformer.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} current creates {{a magnetic field}} that induces voltage back in the primary coil, and {{over a number of}} additional cycles the energy is transferred back to the primary. This process repeats, the energy shifting rapidly {{back and forth between the}} primary and secondary tuned circuits. The oscillating currents in the primary and secondary gradually die out ("ring down") due to energy dissipated as heat in the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> and resistance of the coil.|$|E
25|$|Static {{triggered}} <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> - Commercial {{and industrial}} circuits often apply a DC voltage from {{a power supply}} to charge the capacitor, and use high voltage pulses generated by an oscillator applied to a triggering electrode to trigger the spark. This allows control of the spark rate and exciting voltage. Commercial spark gaps are often enclosed in an insulating gas atmosphere such as sulfur hexafluoride, reducing the length and thus the energy loss in the spark.|$|E

The double line of spheres in the middle are the <b>spark</b> <b>gaps,</b> all other spheres are to avoid corona discharge. Blue=water capacitor. Grey=solid metal. Black= thin wire.

50|$|<b>Spark</b> <b>gaps</b> are {{commonly}} implemented on Printed Circuit Boards in mains power electronics products using two closely spaced exposed PCB traces. This is an effectively zero cost method of adding crude overload protection to electronics products.|$|R
5000|$|A similar circuit is the Marx generator, {{which has}} the same [...] "ladder" [...] structure, but {{consists}} of resistors, capacitors and <b>spark</b> <b>gaps.</b> The Marx generator produces short pulses, whereas the CW generator produces a constant DC.|$|R
25|$|Another type of {{transient}} suppressor is the gas-tube suppressor. This {{is a type}} of <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> that may use air or an inert gas mixture and often, a small amount of radioactive material such as Ni-63, to provide a more consistent breakdown voltage and reduce response time. Unfortunately, these devices may have higher breakdown voltages and longer response times than varistors. However, they can handle significantly higher fault currents and withstand multiple high-voltage hits (for example, from lightning) without significant degradation.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the largest}} {{applications}} of the Tesla coil circuit was in early radio transmitters called <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> transmitters. The first radio wave generators, invented by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, were spark gaps connected directly to antennas, powered by induction coils. Because they lacked a resonant circuit, these transmitters produced highly damped radio waves. As a result, their transmissions occupied an extremely wide bandwidth of frequencies. When multiple transmitters were operating {{in the same area}} their frequencies overlapped and they interfered with one another, causing garbled reception. There was no way for a receiver to select one signal over another.|$|E
25|$|When the <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> fires, the charged {{capacitor}} discharges {{into the}} primary winding, causing the primary circuit to oscillate. The oscillating primary current creates an oscillating magnetic field that couples to the secondary winding, transferring {{energy into the}} secondary side of the transformer and causing it to oscillate with the toroid capacitance to ground. Energy transfer occurs {{over a number of}} cycles, until most of the energy that was originally in the primary side is transferred to the secondary side. The greater the magnetic coupling between windings, the shorter the time required to complete the energy transfer. As energy builds within the oscillating secondary circuit, the amplitude of the toroid's RF voltage rapidly increases, and the air surrounding the toroid begins to undergo dielectric breakdown, forming a corona discharge.|$|E

The <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> of the generator are enclosed in a pressurized nitrogen atmosphere {{which allows the}} charging voltage to be varied by changing the nitrogen pressure...|$|R
5000|$|Commercial <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> {{use this}} {{property}} to abruptly switch high voltages in pulsed power systems, to provide surge protection for telecommunication and electrical power systems, and ignite fuel via spark plugs in internal combustion engines. Spark-gap transmitters {{were used in}} early radio telegraph systems.|$|R
50|$|Special purpose, high-energy triggerable <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> {{can be used}} {{to rapidly}} switch high {{voltages}} and very high currents for certain pulsed power applications, such as pulsed lasers, railguns, fusion, ultrastrong pulsed magnetic field research, and in the triggering of nuclear bombs. Commercially available devices can be divided into two classes: positive pressure and triggered vacuum gaps. Positive pressure triggered gaps have a limited operating voltage range (for instance, from 1/3 to 2/3 of the self breakdown voltage). Triggered vacuum gaps offer a wide operating voltage range (400 V to 90 kV is achievable). Both classes can switch higher energy levels than any thyristor, thyratron, krytron, or sprytron. Triggered gaps are popular for single-shot and low-repetition-rate applications. One such switch is known as a trigatron. The Ignitron and Crossatron could be considered triggered gaps. The latter is unique in that it can be turned back off by the control electrode after conduction begins. The xenon flash tube is another common triggered gap. Various schemes have also been devised to trigger open air gaps on command. A set of <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> are a key element of a Marx generator, used to generate high-voltage impulses; the <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> allow a chain of capacitors to be slowly charged in parallel and then rapidly discharged in series.|$|R
25|$|KDKA's {{establishment}} was {{an outgrowth}} of the post-World War I efforts of the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company of East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to expand its commercial operations in the radio industry. During the war, Westinghouse received government contracts to develop radio transmitters and receivers for military use. They used recently developed vacuum tube equipment that was capable of audio communication. Previous <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> transmitters could only be used to transmit the dots-and-dashes of Morse code. At the time of the entry of the United States into World War I in April 1917, the government ordered all civilian radio stations off the air. However, during the conflict Westinghouse received permission to operate research radio transmitters located at its East Pittsburgh plant and at the home of one of its lead engineers, Frank Conrad, in nearby Wilkinsburg.|$|E
25|$|In 1887, Heinrich Hertz {{observed}} the photoelectric effect {{and the production}} and reception of electromagnetic waves. He published these observations in the journal Annalen der Physik. His receiver consisted of a coil with a <b>spark</b> <b>gap,</b> where a spark would be seen upon detection of electromagnetic waves. He placed the apparatus in a darkened box to see the spark better. However, {{he noticed that the}} maximum spark length was reduced when in the box. A glass panel placed between the source of electromagnetic waves and the receiver absorbed ultraviolet radiation that assisted the electrons in jumping across the gap. When removed, the spark length would increase. He observed no decrease in spark length when he replaced glass with quartz, as quartz does not absorb UV radiation. Hertz concluded his months of investigation and reported the results obtained. He did not further pursue investigation of this effect.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the typical}} circuit, the spark gap's short circuiting action {{prevents}} high-frequency oscillations from 'backing up' into the supply transformer. In the alternate circuit, high amplitude high frequency oscillations that appear across the capacitor also are applied to the supply transformer's winding. This can induce corona discharges between turns that weaken and eventually destroy the transformer's insulation. Experienced Tesla coil builders almost exclusively use the top circuit, often augmenting it with low pass filters (resistor and capacitor (RC) networks) between the supply transformer and <b>spark</b> <b>gap</b> to help protect the supply transformer. This is especially important when using transformers with fragile high-voltage windings, such as neon sign transformers (NSTs). Regardless of which configuration is used, the HV transformer must be of a type that self-limits its secondary current by means of internal leakage inductance. A normal (low leakage inductance) high-voltage transformer must use an external limiter (sometimes called a ballast) to limit current. NSTs are designed to have high leakage inductance to limit their short circuit current to a safe level.|$|E

50|$|These hazards are {{not present}} when the arc is formed {{outdoors}} since the heated ionized gases will rise {{up into the}} air and dissipate into the atmosphere. <b>Spark</b> <b>gaps</b> which only intermittently produce short spark bursts are also minimally hazardous because the volume of ions generated is very small.|$|R
