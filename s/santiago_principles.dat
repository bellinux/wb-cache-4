The PRF was created {{as a response to the}} expected increase in liabilities related to old-age pensions and benefits, especially for the poor, and it had accumulated US$5.883 million (market value) by the end of 2012. The PRF is set to receive yearly capital injections between 0.2% and 0.5% of the previous year’s GDP depending on the fiscal surplus, so new resources are secured every year. The ESSF’s objective is to stabilize fiscal spending by providing funds to finance fiscal deficits and debt amortization and had market value of US$14.998 million by the end of year 2012. Each year, the ESSF accumulates any fiscal surplus remaining after the contributions to the FRP and to the capital of the Central Bank of Chile, excluding debt service and anticipatory contributions during the previous year. The funds are managed by the Central Bank of Chile and a Financial Committee advises on their investment policy. Chile also participated in the discussion and agreed to the <b>Santiago</b> <b>Principles.</b>|$|E

40|$|The risks {{associated}} with sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) transactions are essentially two-fold: political, {{to the extent that}} SWFs could be used as the armed wing of States’ foreign policy, and economic, since there is a risk of public subsidization or other types of market distortions through their investments. It is within this framework that the idea of international best practices aimed at a better regulation of SWFs was envisaged. This led to the adoption of the “Generally Accepted Principles and Practices” for SWFs, also labelled as the “Santiago Principles”. While the <b>Santiago</b> <b>Principles</b> may be useful for a better regulation of the relationship between fund managers and owners, they are nevertheless absolutely futile for considering and protecting the interests of the host States of sovereign investments. Thus, the <b>Santiago</b> <b>Principles</b> go against their founding objective. To this extent, the <b>Santiago</b> <b>Principles</b> shall not be regarded as a genuine form of international regulation, but rather as a veneer of respectability to improve the way recipient States perceive sovereign investors...|$|E

40|$|A {{sovereign}} wealth fund (SWF) is {{a long-term}} investment fund owned by the state. The oldest is the Kuwait Investment Corporation, which was established in 1953. However, because most SWFs were established in 2004 or later, SWFs are, generally speaking, a fairly new phenomenon. Depending on the definition, there are currently between 38 and 50 SWFs worldwide. An SWF can exert influence {{on the behavior of}} companies through its investment policy. Due to the expanding number of SWFs, host states became concerned that investments by SWFs could be politically motivated. To ensure host states that SWFs have no political motivations, but merely seek profit, the <b>Santiago</b> <b>Principles</b> were established. However, in a time where private investors are pressed to focus more on social values to become ‘socially responsible’, it may seem strange that SWFs are pressured into a model of private behavior with the objective of only maximizing financial and economic values. This article explores the scope of responsibilities of SWFs in terms of social responsible investment (SRI). The article provides a definition of SWFs and examines the concept of SRI and whether SRI is compatible with the <b>Santiago</b> <b>Principles.</b> Part of the study comprises an evaluation of 38 investment funds, which all qualify as SWFs as per the author’s definition. The legal basis (whether an SWF is embedded in a separate legal entity), governance structure (how the management of the fund is regulated, and whether the regulation is laid down in statutes), and objectives of each of the SWFs are examined. Moreover, it is examined which private regulatory regimes were adopted by these SWFs. The UN Principles of Responsible Investment (UN PRI) and the <b>Santiago</b> <b>Principles</b> will be discussed in more depth. Finally, this article discusses whether SWFs, due to their link to the state, should become leaders in the sustainable investment field...|$|E
40|$|Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) {{have become}} a {{prominent}} feature of the international financial landscape. They are sufficiently diverse in their origins, structures, and objectives that generalizations are perilous. However, legitimate concerns have been raised in home and host countries about the management, behavior, and interactions of these funds. Many of those concerns can be addressed via increased accountability and transparency. The <b>Santiago</b> <b>Principles</b> are a good start in doing so, but Edwin M. Truman's SWF scoreboard points to areas where these principles can be improved. Meanwhile, SWF compliance must be further increased. At the same time, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) effort to address concerns from the host-country side has not resulted in the erection of new barriers to that form of cross-border investment, but the OECD failed to reverse the creeping financial protectionism of the past decade. Because of their size {{and the source of}} their funding, some Asian funds are different. As a result, they will be held to a higher standard of accountability and transparency even as their government owners press for more openness to cross-border investment.
