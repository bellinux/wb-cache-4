500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Aulie was {{assigned}} to the Marlies after training camp with the Maple Leafs. [...] He was later called up to the NHL on November 12, 2010, when Dion Phaneuf was injured. Aulie played his first career NHL game the next day against the Vancouver Canucks, playing 12 games total with the Maple Leafs in his call-up before ultimately being returned to the Marlies. Despite the time he spent away from the AHL, Aulie was selected to the Western Conference team for the AHL All-Star Game. During the Skills Competition, Aulie competed in the hardest shot event, finishing third, with a top speed of 95.5mph. After the Maple Leafs traded defenceman François Beauchemin to the Anaheim Ducks, Aulie was called up to rejoin the team. Maple Leafs General Manager Brian Burke said {{one of the reasons for}} the trade was to open up a spot at the NHL level for Aulie: [...] "...as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> a roster spot, we're calling up Keith Aulie. We expect him to be here for a while." [...] Aulie engaged in his first career NHL fight against Scott Hartnell of the Philadelphia Flyers, earning him the nickname [...] "Muhammad Aulie." [...] He scored his first career NHL goal against the New York Islanders on March 9, 2011.|$|E

We usually have some sort of mental picture of what we're going to do and set out all sorts of guidelines for ourselves to get there. But as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> working, the process takes precedence. The control room gets out of control, in a manner of speaking. We start with lots of belief in ourselves and our abilities, and end up in nothing but mistrust and dissolution.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1997 {{he tried}} to help the Second Division {{football}} club Exeter City win a crucial end of season game by placing [...] "energy-infused" [...] crystals behind the goals at Exeter's ground (Exeter lost the game 5–1); he was appointed co-chairman of the club in 2002. The club was relegated to the Football Conference in May 2003, where it remained for five years. He has since severed formal ties with the club. He had also been involved with Reading F.C. and claimed in 2002 that he had helped them to avoid relegation by getting the club's supporters to look {{into his eyes and}} say [...] "win, Reading, win". Reading manager Alan Pardew however dismissed Geller's role in the club's survival - which was achieved thanks to a draw in the crucial match rather than a Reading victory - stating [...] "as <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> a bit of joy, thanks to all the hard work and efforts of my staff and players, he suddenly comes out of the blue and tries to claim the limelight." ...|$|E

On November 18, 2008 a query on the German site for Amazon.com for the book resulted in the message [...] "not available". Days prior to the report on the incident by The Register, Tom Cruise attended an Amazon.com employee meeting, and treated the employees to a special screening of his movie Valkyrie, set {{to be released in}} December 2008. According to the Swedish news site Realtid.se, John Duignan did not think Cruise was responsible for the legal threats to Amazon.com. Amazon.com spokeswoman Patty Smith commented on the status of the book in a November 16, 2008 article in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer: [...] "We're awaiting shipments of the book into our fulfillment network. Once it arrives, we'll send it out to customers who've ordered it. ... Since the libel laws are different in the U.K., they are not able to sell the book." ...|$|E
