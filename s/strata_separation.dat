40|$|Prediction of {{potential}} methane emission pathways {{from various sources}} into active mine workings or sealed gobs from longwall overburden is important for controlling methane and for improving mining safety. The aim {{of this paper is}} to infer <b>strata</b> <b>separation</b> intervals and thus gas emission pathways from standard well log data. The proposed technique was applied to well logs acquired through the Mary Lee/Blue Creek coal seam of the Upper Pottsville Formation in the BlackWarrior Basin, Alabama, using well logs froma series of boreholes aligned along a nearly linear profile. For this purpose, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) of digitized gamma well logs was performed by using Mexican hat and Morlet, as the mother wavelets, to identify potential discontinuities in the signal. Pointwise Hölder exponents (PHE) of gamma logs were also computed using the generalized quadratic variations (GQV) method to identify the location and strength of singularities of well log signals as a complementary analysis. PHEs and wavelet coefficients were analyzed to find the locations of singularities along the logs. Using the well logs in this study, locations of predicted singularities were used as indicators in single normal equation simulation (SNESIM) to generate equi-probable realizations {{of potential}} <b>strata</b> <b>separation</b> intervals. Horizontal and vertical variograms of realizations were then analyzed and compared with those of indicator data and training image (TI) data using the Kruskal–Wallis test. A sum of squared differences was employed to select the most probable realization representing the locations of potential strata separations and methane flow paths. Results indicated that singularities located inwell log signals reliably correlatedwith strata transitions or discontinuities within the strata. Geostatistical simulation of these discontinuities provided information about the location and extents of the continuous channels that may form during mining. If there is a gas source within their zone of influence, paths may develop and allow methane movement towards sealed or active gobs under pressure differentials. Knowledge gained from this research will better prepare mine operations for potential methane inflows, thus improving mine safety...|$|E
40|$|Layered strata {{occurrence}} {{is frequently}} seen in underground constructions, the man-made excavation is thus easy to cause separation between neighboring strata. The sudden and unexpected occurrence of separation will induce significant shock wave and vibration to relative bolting system that initially holds the normal working space for underground production. The bolting system is extremely sensitive to this shock and is easily weakened or damaged. By examining {{the locations of}} <b>strata</b> <b>separation</b> {{and the extent of}} damage along an anchoring interface, this paper investigates the factors that influence the support strength of anchoring system. The results show that the support strength of a bolt is independent of the separation location if the resin-rock interface is intact. The opposite is the case if the separation width between the neighboring strata exceeds the ultimate critical value, which induces damage along the interface. In this case, the support strength increases exponentially as the separation increases. Separation at the free loading end dramatically decreases the support strength. However, this decrease is mitigated if the separation is located {{in the middle of the}} anchoring body or at the loading end. These results are then calibrated and verified in a laboratory test...|$|E

This paper designs the {{physical}} model as geological conditions of XinZhi mine 2204 face of Huozhou Bureau of Mines in Shanxi province, it simulates the formation process {{and distribution of}} the mining rock fracture using simulation experiment of similar material, and researches the evolvement law of rock’s fracture network in caving zone, fractured zone using fractal geometry theory. The conclusion of the experiment indicates: with the advance of the working surface, the rock fracture develops from bottom to top, the different fracture network forms corresponds to the different push distance of the working surface, the latter network piles up the previous network, mining makes more complex distribution of rock fractures. The amount of overlying <b>strata</b> <b>separation</b> is three-stage separation law of development, including Initiating phase separation, Expansion phase separation and closed phase separation. Critical layer to any point along the separation experienced by the small → large → small and stable process of change. At the same time, the fractal dimension of the mining rock fracture goes through small to large, under the identical mining width, the fractal dimension of fractured zone is caving zone of 80 % to 90 %, at last, when the mining work is finished, the fractal dimension dropped to a more stable value...|$|E

When additional stress caused by building foundation reached a thick hard rock sandstone stratum, the vertical deformation was blocked while horizontal deformation expanded significantly. The actual influence depth of ground loading is obvious smaller than theoretical result. The spread depth of building load upon mined out area is related with the disturbed degree by mining, the ground loads spread depth is greater {{with the increase of}} disturbance degree. After passed through key strata and caused overburden <b>stratum</b> <b>separation</b> closed, the additional stress caused by ground foundation would quickly reach inside of goaf, caused movement and deformation on strata upon goaf.

40|$|In {{order to}} master the {{tendency}} mining-fracture-evolution characteristics of overlying strata and coal seams above working face with large inclination angle and mining depth in mining process, the 1221 working face in Zhao mine is selected as the engineering background and a mathematical model is established. The displacement variation, stress and strain of overlying strata and coal seams are simulated by using ANSYS software. In the mining process, the movement characteristics, displacement variation laws and fracture evolution characteristics of overlying strata and coal seams above working face with large inclination angle and mining depth along inclination direction are discussed. Simulation results show that with the advance of working face, the fracture development of overlying strata and coal seams is larger and larger; the area of gob is gradually expanding and the transverse stress of overlying strata and coal seams is also expanding. Stress contour of overlying strata and coal seams {{at both ends of}} gob becomes denser and denser; the activity of the overlying strata and coal seams near the up-roadway side of the gob is violent. The pressure relief zone is formed in {{the upper part of the}} strata and the roof above the gob. Large inclination angle of coal seam results in larger supporting pressure in the underside of the gob and smaller supporting pressure in the upper side of the gob. Along the inclination direction of the working face, the pressure relief zone is mainly concentrated in the outlet roadway of the working face; the fracture development and <b>strata</b> <b>separation</b> are obvious, which offer good passage for gas flow and migration...|$|E

In addition, the activities of overburden stratum, such as deformation, <b>stratum</b> <b>separation,</b> caving, also exhibited important effects. Compared to caving activities of the immediate roof and main roof, the critical upper strata with the larger thickness and strength showed more important influence on the damage evolution of floor stratum and water inrush risk, although it was relatively far from the coal seam. Before the initial caving of critical roof, the destruction extent of floor stratum and the risk of water inrush increased with the increase of the mined-out area and reached their peaks when the maximum caving interval was reached. When critical strata started periodic caving, the extent of destruction of floor and the risk of water inrush reached their peaks when hanging arch of critical strata reached the maximum value in this period. For caving interval in critical strata is larger than the mail roof and the stress pressure was mainly applied {{in the rear of the}} mined-out area other than the mining face, it is difficult to observe the rules of the activities of critical strata above coal sea...|$|R

40|$|Abscission {{of leaves}} and {{reproductive}} parts of plants {{is presented in the}} form of a model which allows the reader to see the process as a whole. The process of abscission was divided into 2 parts: the first of which may be inhibited or reversed by auxin, and the second, which is mostly irreversible. Increased ethylene (ET) production links the earlier phases of senescence with abscission. ET has a double role in the initiation of the abscission process: (1) acting on the leaf blade, it withholds the export of auxin from a leaf, in consequence the abscission zone (AZ) is scarcely supplied with this hormone. When this state lasts sufficiently long, AZ tissues become sensitive to the second action of ET, (2) that is, to its dorect action on the AZ. When this occurs, the further stage of abscission is triggered. The possible roles of abscisic acid, tyloses and the influence of environmental factors are also discussed. During the further, mostly irreversible stage of abscission, marked stimulation of metabolic activity takes place in the AZ and its tissues attract nutrients. Sharp hormonal gradients appear in the AZ, leading probably to the precise localization of the "separation stratum" in the AZ where the detachment finally occurs. Further on, the detachment of the plant part may be accomplished in different ways, however, one "way" does not exclude the simultaneous participation of other(s). Thus, abscission may be accomplished by the enzymatic degradation of the middle lamella and primary cell wall, or by inducing cell divisions in the <b>separation</b> <b>stratum</b> with subsequent breaking of the newly formed cells. It can occur as well due to uneven augmentation of the cells belonging to the neighbouring cell layers which results in mechanical strain among them and in tearing apart. Separation may occur also due to a collapse of the cells of the AZ which leads to the formation of empty spaces. The problem of infallibility of physiological processes is briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Session no, 238 - T 9. Reconstruction of East Asian Blocks in PangeaControversy {{still exists}} {{regarding}} the Paleozoic accretionary {{history of the}} Paleo-Asian Ocean (PAO), whose opening, development and closure {{led to the formation}} of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. As an important element of the PAO, the South Tianshan Ocean once separated the Tarim Craton to the south and Central-Tianshan and Yili blocks to the north. However, controversy has surrounded the time of the opening and the subduction polarity of the ocean. To resolve the controversy, we carried out detailed provenance studies on the Silurian-Carboniferous sedimentary rocks in the Kepingtage area at the northwestern margin of the Tarim Craton by means of detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopic analyses. Detrital zircon ages from the Silurian-Early Devonian sandstones cluster at ~ 2. 5 Ga, ~ 1. 8 Ga, 1300 - 900 Ma, 900 - 740 Ma and 500 - 400 Ma. These age populations and corresponding Hf isotopes are consistent with major magmatic events in the Tarim Craton and the Central Tianshan Block. The 500 - 400 Ma zircons, which are magmatic in origin and have varied εHf(t) values (- 13 to + 12), are comparable with zircons from contemporaneous magmatic rocks in the Central Tianshan Block and the northern Tarim Craton. These zircons were most likely deposited in a retro-arc foreland basin inboard of an Early Paleozoic Andean-type magmatic arc, which had existed on the united northern Tarim-Central Tianshan block until the Late Silurian. Detrital zircons from Early and Late Carboniferous siliciclasts gave U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes essentially identical to those from the Silurian-Early Devonian sandstones. Circa 380 - 300 Ma zircons, which are widespread in the Central Tianshan Block, have not been recorded in the Carboniferous <b>strata,</b> implying the <b>separation</b> of the Central Tianshan Block from the Tarim Craton since the Early Devonian. This separation probably resulted from the opening of the South Tianshan Ocean. Accordingly, we propose a new tectonic model involving a transition from a Silurian advancing accretionary orogen to an Early Devonian retreating orogen in order to interpret available geological/geochronological data in the northern Tarim and Tianshan region. We suggest that this tectonic transition was associated with the dispersion of the northeastern part of Gondwana...|$|R
