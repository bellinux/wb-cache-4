Within the context of a clinical interview, the risk for imminent danger to the self or others is important to address but is not the focus of assessment.

40|$|Background Personality affects {{psychological}} wellbeing, and <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> may mediate this effect. This may {{be particularly}} pertinent in later life, when social structures change significantly, {{and can lead to}} a decline in psychological wellbeing. Aim To examine, in an older population, whether the relationships between neuroticism and extraversion and mental wellbeing are moderated by available <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>networks.</b> Method We gathered information from 536 community-dwelling older adults, regarding personality, <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>networks,</b> depressive symptomatology, anxiety and perceived stress, as well as controlling for age and gender. Results Neuroticism and extraversion interacted with <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> to determine psychological wellbeing (depression, stress and anxiety). High scores on the <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> measure appear to be protective against the deleterious effects of high scores on the neuroticism scale on psychological wellbeing. Meanwhile, individuals high in extraversion appear to require large <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> in order to maintain psychological wellbeing. Conclusion Large familial and friendship <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> are associated with good psychological wellbeing. To optimise psychological wellbeing in older adults, improving <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> may be differentially effective for different personality types...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a strong}} {{research}} evidence showing the crucial role of <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> in defining successful coping strategies by female-headed families, especially in South European Countries. In such a context, single mothers are more vulnerable {{to the risk of}} social isolation {{due to the lack of}} childcare, the limited rights to even a low subsistence income and the labor market rigidity -which discourages women’s participation in the work force. The present contribution aims at analyzing <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> of single mothers by considering the role of kinship and friendship ties as essential sources of support and generators of social integration. An ego-centered network approach is adopted to reconstruct <b>social</b> <b>support</b> <b>networks</b> of a sample of single mothers in Naples.
