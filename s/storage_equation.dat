40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{generate}} {{a deeper understanding of}} the representation of hydropower in long-term models. This is done by mapping and modelling (cascading) hydropower in Sweden with the Open Source energy MOdelling SYStem (OSeMOSYS). The first part of the thesis builds on a literature review and provides an introduction to hydropower in Sweden. The second part focuses on implementing the <b>storage</b> <b>equations</b> in OSeMOSYS. These are applied by modelling hydropower at various levels of detail to evaluate the result when the depth of detail of the storage modelling is increased. First, a model of Sweden without hydropower storage is modelled. Then, two models were set up which include storage; one with one hydropower storage for all of Sweden, one with nine rivers with storage. Finally, two models considering cascading hydropower with storage were developed; where the first is an expansion of the model with one storage for all of Sweden and the second model examine two rivers more thorough. The remain-ing power system is represented in a stylised fashion, compliant with prevailing long-term energy modelling techniques. The implications of the different levels of detail are compared and discussed.

40|$|Existing {{analytical}} {{treatments of}} groundwater flow have mostly been founded on classical hydrodynamics, that groundwater motion is derivable from a velocity potential. This conception is in contradiction with {{the principle of}} conservation of energy, although it conforms with {{the principle of the}} conservation of mass (Hubbert, 1940, p. 285; Scheidegger, 1960, pps. 74 - 75; Bear, 1972, pps. 122 - 123). This dissertation shows that both principles can be utilized, {{based on the fact that}} a force potential at a point is equal to the work required to transfer a unit mass from this point to another point. This potential is given the symbol φ - gh - gz + (p/ρ) and is incorporated in the force field E. This potential is related to the flow field (q) by the anisotropic hydraulic conductivity. This relation forms a solid formulation for the theory of the flow of fluids through fractured porous media. This relation is applied to develop two basic equations. One partial differential equation, representing flow in the fracture, depending on the actual geometry of the fracture and incorporating the anisotropic parameter of the hydraulic conductivity based on the thermal induced stress and the force potential. A second partial differential equation (<b>storage</b> <b>equation)</b> in two-dimensions for non-steady groundwater flow in confined and saturated aquifers. This <b>storage</b> <b>equation</b> incorporates time, hydraulic conductivity and the radial coordinates. It is solved analytically using the Bessel's functions Jₒ and Kₒ. The two equations represent two models. Both the potential and the thermal hydraulic conductivity constitute a coupling between the two models to render the models a thermohydromechanical model. This aspect is the essential theme underlying this work and is implemented through a matrix-fracture system based on the slow flow and the fast flow behavior. The evaluation of the transient parameters including the aperture becomes possible and falls in line with the physics of the problem. This comprehensive analytical model is found to satisfy the transient demands of the mathematical physics.

The improvement of computational resources as hardware and software has been responsible for complex and large scale simulations of three-dimensional sedimentary basin models in regional scale, allowing the analysis over the history of a sedimentary basin formation, from its sediments deposition up to generation, expulsion, migration, trapping and conservation of hydrocarbons. Geological faults can {{play an important role in}} producing migration paths and can be simulated by interface finite elements. In this work, the effects of mechanical simulation of stress of geological fractured media by zero-thickness interface elements (considering small displacements) are coupled to fluid flow in faults modeled by threedimensional hydraulic interface elements based on the two-dimensional element developed by Segura et al.

A process transfer function is used for transient <b>storage</b> <b>equations</b> with first-order reaction terms to represent nitrate uptake in the free stream and denitrification in the storage regions. In the context of a short-term nitrate injection we define nitrate assimilative capacity as 1 − [inline equation, symbol A] where the attenuation factor, [inline equation, symbol A], is the fraction of injected nitrate mass that is flushed past the outlet of stream. Net exchange with groundwater is modeled by allowing free stream discharge to vary from one reach section to the next. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to compare results of the compartmental model with the OTIS numerical model. Out of 350 Monte Carlo simulations of a stream consisting of five reach sections the highest relative percent difference was 15 %, most being well below 10 %, as determined using moment analysis on breakthrough curves. Moment analysis on published experimental breakthrough curves showed assimilative capacities did not differ from those determined with the compartmental model by more than about 0. 035 and were well within the uncertainty due to possible errors in measured stream metrics and net exchange with groundwater.

40|$|Transport {{phenomena}} in hydrologic systems are simulated with finite-state models (FSMs), which {{are similar to}} mixing cell models in that they utilize a mixing cell as their basic subdivision, yet are more flexible, capable of modeling more complex systems, and easier to manipulate than previous mixing cell models. The basic FSM equations are discrete, recursive forms of the continuity equation for mass transport and the <b>storage</b> <b>equation</b> for fluid transport. Different types of mixing and flow can be simulated by specifying appropriate algorithms {{for use in the}} basic equations. Finite-state models thus have a physical basis, although they avoid the use of differential equations. The FSM digital computer model can simulate systems in one, two, or three spatial dimensions with relative facility. In many important cases, transit number and age number distributions can be calculated. These distributions, and especially their means, are useful in determining fluid residence times in hydrologic systems. Two aquifer systems are modeled using finite-state models. In a portion of the Tucson Basin Aquifer of southern Arizona a three-dimensional, steady flow FSM is used to account for the observed carbon- 14 age distribution in the aquifer without assuming piston flow in the aquifer and without evaluating dispersion parameters. This model provides a first approximation of the three-dimensional flow distribution, an estimate of the long-term average annual recharge, and fluid residence times in the aquifer. The second FSM, two-dimensional and non-steady flow, accounts for the transient distribution of tritium in the Edwards Limestone of south-central Texas. This aquifer is a highly anisotropic, nonhomogeneous karst aquifer that is difficult to model by traditional methods. In both models, first guesses for cell volumes and flow distributions were {{made on the basis of}} available hydrogeological data. Saturated, unsaturated, and open-channel flow also are examined.

40|$|Evaluation of the {{variability}} of theoretical and effective CO 2 storage capacity estimation within depleted gas reservoirs {{is dependent on the}} integrated analysis of reservoir structure, aquifer performance and thermodynamic behaviour. Four published theoretical CO 2 storage capacity methods and one effective method have been used to estimate the capacity and variability of two Triassic depletion drive reservoirs and two Triassic water drive reservoirs located within the UK Southern North Sea and East Irish Sea Basin. Input parameters to the <b>storage</b> capacity <b>equations</b> have shown a degree of natural variability whereas others are more accurately constrained. As such, {{attempts have been made to}} more accurately constrain the most variable input parameters. The geometric, petrophysical and production characteristics of the reservoirs are analysed. Material balance methods are used to assess the reservoir drive mechanism of the reservoirs. If reservoirs are found to experience a water drive, the aquifer strength is estimated. The gas compressibility factor, gas formation volume factor and CO 2 density is estimated under initial reservoir temperature conditions using six equations of state for comparison of results. These results are then input to <b>storage</b> capacity <b>equations</b> producing a range of estimates. The most susceptible parameter to variability was the cumulative volume of water influx to a reservoir, We. Variability was also found to be the result of error in estimation of the original gas in place. As such, the water drive reservoirs made further use of aquifer modelling to achieve more precise estimates of OGIP and We. The effective capacity coefficients for the various reservoirs have been estimated to assess the proportion of pore space available for CO 2 storage. The effective CO 2 storage capacity constitutes a fraction of the theoretical CO 2 storage capacity which ranges between 0 (no storage possible) and 1 (all theoretically accessible pore volume is occupied by CO 2). Overall, it was found that depletion drive reservoirs have the potential to store greater volumes of CO 2 than water drive reservoirs whose aquifer waters occupy the newly liberated pore space. ...|$|R

Changes in ground-water storage are taken into account, and by choosing the beginning and end points of the year at times of field capacity, water storage changes in the soil mass are eliminated.

40|$|Surface {{depression}} storage (Ds) is {{the volume}} of precipitation excess which is stored by surface microrelief features of soils. The volume of water stored in surface depressions when precipitation rate exceeds infiltration rate reduces the amount of runoff generated. Because Ds is dependent on soil microrelief, land slope, and crop residue, tillage and management practices can have a considerable impact on {{the magnitude of this}} value. When modeling irrigation systems and surface hydrology, depression storage is often treated as a static abstraction, meaning that maximum storage volume must be filled before runoff occurs. However, several researchers have documented that runoff begins before depressions fill maximally. To investigate this process, Plaster of Paris casts of 12 soil surfaces were collected from plots that are part of a tillage study which includes plow, disk, and no-till treatments. The plaster surfaces were subjected to 100 mm/hr of simulated rain on a bed with adjustable slope. Dynamic filling of surface depressions was analyzed by measuring depression storage at points before maximum depression storage was achieved. An empirical relationship relating depressional storage to potential precipitation excess is proposed, and suggests that the dynamic nature of depressional storage may be predicted if the maximum depressional storage and excess precipitation hyetograph are known. The effect of dynamic depression filling on runoff generation from a hillslope was simulated in the HEC-HMS hydrologic model. This was accomplished by manipulating Green and Ampt infiltration parameters to generate precipitation excess predicted by the empirical dynamic depression <b>storage</b> <b>equation.</b> The results show that dynamic depression filling leads to significant changes in both the rate and timing of runoff generation compared to the static depression storage filling assumption.

The cascade of 2 unequal fractionalorder reservoirs is shown to converge to that of the integer order case, whilst the cascade of equal reservoirs shows some differences. For the modelling of the total rainfall-streamflow process the single fractional order reservoir model with a constant initialisation function is tested on a selection of events for a range of UK catchment scales (22 km^ to 510 km). A rainfall loss model is incorporated to account for infiltration and evapotranspiration. The results show that the new approach is viable for modelling the rainfall-streamflow transformation at the lumped catchment scale, although the parameter values are not constant for a given catchment.

It is infered that the area producing runoff expands {{in the direction of the}} slope as rainingprolonged. 3) The results of this observation made in the study watershed proved the propriety of the model of"Partial Area Concept". 4) In this watershed the flow in the surface layer can be divided into sub-surface flow and laminarsurface flow, by border of about 7 mm of storage depth. 5) The parameters P and K in the <b>storage</b> function <b>equation</b> (1) are closely related to the behaviorsof the flow on the surface layer and the average scale of the area producing runoff for each occurrence...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGeomorphological {{structure}} and geological heterogeneity of hillslopes are major controls on runoff responses. The diversity of hillslopes (morphological shapes and geological structures) on one hand, and the highly non linear runoff mechanism response {{on the other}} hand, {{make it difficult to}} transpose what has been learnt at one specific hillslope to another. Therefore, making reliable predictions on runoff appearance or river flow for a given hillslope is a challenge. Applying a classic model calibration (based on inverse problems technique) requires doing it for each specific hillslope and having some data available for calibration. When applied to thousands of cases it cannot always be promoted. Here we propose a novel modeling framework based on coupling process based models with data based approach. First we develop a mechanistic model, based on hillslope <b>storage</b> Boussinesq <b>equations</b> (Troch et al. 2003), able to model non linear runoff responses to rainfall at the hillslope scale. Second we set up a model database, representing thousands of non calibrated simulations. These simulations investigate different hillslope shapes (real ones obtained by analyzing 5 m digital elevation model of Brittany and synthetic ones), different hillslope geological structures (i. e. different parametrizations) and different hydrologic forcing terms (i. e. different infiltration chronicles). Then, we use this model library to train a machine learning model on this physically based database. Machine learning model performance is then assessed by a classic validating phase (testing it on new hillslopes and comparing machine learning with mechanistic outputs). Finally we use this machine learning model to learn what are the hillslope properties controlling runoffs. This methodology will be further tested combining synthetic datasets with real ones...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLandscape {{structure}} and geological heterogeneities are major controls on subsurface flow dynamic. Particularly it has strong impact on saturated areas (potential hotspots) emergence, promoting seepage production. This control leads to highly non linear flow response where, for each hillslope location, two possible states can be distinguished: {{with or without}} seepage. Different algorithmic solutions have been proposed to model this process. A solution is to solve subsurface flow for an assumed water table position and then iterate on the water table position until convergence is met. Seepage areas and seepage values are then deduced from the locations where water table intersects surface. A second way to proceed is to explicitly couple groundwater equations and surface water equations with an exchange flux. Here we developed a novel approach using the complementarity framework to reconcile in a single system the two states potentially encountered (with or without seepage). The complementarity framework manages the current state and the possible transition between states thanks to a specifically devoted equation. This framework {{is applied to the}} 1 D hillslope <b>storage</b> Boussinesq <b>equations</b> (Troch et al. 2003). Reformulating this complementarity system differently enables to partition effectively the local flux balance between storage variation and seepage. This differential algebraic equations (DAEs) system has the major benefit to be directly solvable with built-in ode libraries. Finally the system is regularized to enhance fast and efficient solving. This model is stable with fast spatial convergence. It respects the mass balance locally beyond the tolerance limits and shows limited sensitivity to the value of the regularization parameter. The model appears to be robust, able to solve complex realistic case with presence of landscape heterogeneity and real hydrologic forcing. This model will then be used as a physical basis to implement biogeochemistry reactivity...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{approaches}} of FAO 24 and FMP 1, a new empirical approach simulating evapotranspiration from groundwater (ETgw) under different soil water conditions was proposed in present study. Then, through {{the data from}} volumetric lysimeter, the new approach was compared with the two approaches of FMP 1, C 1 and C 2. The new approach gave acceptable simulation results for the treatments under different water conditions, and especially gave better results for the treatments influenced markedly by precipitation or irrigation than the other approaches. The large errors in the late stage in 2009 {{might be due to}} the effect of the early maturity of winter wheat. It also indicated that the critical soil water <b>storages</b> in the <b>equation</b> in FAO 24 were not suitable to describe the relationship between ETgw and soil water storage in root zone when water table was at or above 150 cm depth, and could be replaced with the storage corresponding to the field capacity and the steady storage. The new approach was more suitable for estimating the ETgw under different soil water conditions comparing with C 1 and C 2...|$|R
40|$|Equations {{of motion}} are presented, {{appropriate}} to interacting charged particles of diverse charge and mass, {{subject to the}} external forces produced by various kinds of magnetic fields and radio-frequency (rf) electric fields in <b>storage</b> rings. These <b>equations</b> are employed in the molecular dynamics simulations to study the properties of crystalline beams. The two necessary conditions for the formation and maintenance of crystalline beams are summarized. The transition from ID to 2 D, and from 2 D to 3 D is explored, and the scaling behavior of the heating rates is discussed especially in the high temperature limit. The effectiveness of various cooling techniques in achieving crystalline states has been investigated. Crystalline beams made of two different species of ions via sympathetic cooling are presented, as well as circulating ``crystal balls`` bunched in all directions by magnetic focusing and rf field. By numerically reconstructing the original experimental conditions of the NAP-M ring, {{it is found that}} only at extremely low beam intensities, outside of the range of the original measurement, proton particles can form occasionally-passing disks. The proposed New ASTRID ring is shown to be suitable for the formation and maintenance of crystalline beams of all dimensions...|$|R
