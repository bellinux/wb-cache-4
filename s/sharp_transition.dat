5|$|Here the key {{difference}} to notice {{is that there}} is no surface tension between the solid and the vapor for the second surface tension component. This is because of the assumption that the surface of air that is exposed is under the droplet and is the only other substrate in the system. Subsequently, the equation is then expressed as (1 – f). Therefore, the Cassie equation can be easily derived from the Cassie–Baxter equation. Experimental results regarding the surface properties of Wenzel versus Cassie–Baxter systems showed the effect of pinning for a Young angle of 180 to 90°, a region classified under the Cassie–Baxter model. This liquid/air composite system is largely hydrophobic. After that point, a <b>sharp</b> <b>transition</b> to the Wenzel regime was found where the drop wets the surface, but no further than edges of the drop.|$|E
5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very <b>sharp</b> <b>transition</b> between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} spatial networks that realize {{a balance between}} an infrastructure cost (the cost of wire needed to connect the network in space) and communication efficiency, measured by average shortest path length. A global optimization procedure yields network topologies in which this balance is optimized. These are compared with network topologies generated by a competitive process in which each node strives to optimize its own cost-communication balance. Three phases are observed in globally optimal configurations for different cost-communication trade offs: (i) regular small worlds, (ii) starlike networks, and (iii) trees with a center of interconnected hubs. In the latter regime, i. e., for very expensive wire, power laws in the link length distributions P(w) ?w?? are found, which {{can be explained by}} a hierarchical organization of the networks. In contrast, in the local optimization process the presence of <b>sharp</b> <b>transitions</b> between different network regimes depends on the dimension of the underlying space. Whereas for d=? <b>sharp</b> <b>transitions</b> between fully connected networks, regular small worlds, and highly cliquish periphery-core networks are found, for d= 1 <b>sharp</b> <b>transitions</b> are absent and the power law behavior in the link length distribution persists over a much wider range of link cost parameters.

5000|$|SPB stars: More massive SPB (Slowly Pulsating B) stars show a {{frequency}} spectrum dominated by high order gravity modes {{excited by the}} κ mechanism at work in layers where ionizations of iron group elements produces an opacity peak.

40|$|Abstract- In {{the modern}} age, the digital image {{has taken the}} place of the {{original}} analog photograph, and the forgery of digital images has become increasingly easy, and harder to detect. Image splicing is the process of making a composite picture by cutting and joining two or more photographs. An approach to efficient image splicing detection is proposed here. The spliced image often introduces a number of <b>sharp</b> <b>transitions</b> such as lines, edges and corners. Phase congruency is a sensitive measure of these <b>sharp</b> <b>transitions</b> and is hence proposed as a feature for splicing detection. Statistical moments of characteristic functions of wavelet sub-bands have been examined to detect the differences between the authentic images and spliced images. Image splicing detection can be treated as a two-class pattern recognition problem, which builds the model using moment features and some other parameters extracted from the given test image. Artificial neural network (ANN) is chosen as a classifier to train and test the given images...|$|R
