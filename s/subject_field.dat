In the 2016–2017 Times' university ranking for computer science, Waterloo was ranked 23rd in the world, and second in Canada. In the U.S. News and World Report 2017 ranking for computer science, the university was ranked 18th in the world and first in Canada. In QS's 2017 university ranking for computer science and information systems, Waterloo was ranked 31st in the world, and second in Canada. In Maclean's 2017 national ranking of computer science programs, Waterloo was tied with the University of British Columbia for second in Canada. The university's Faculty of Mathematics, North America’s only standalone mathematics faculty, has also gained notability. In QS's 2017 world university rankings by <b>subject</b> <b>field,</b> the university was ranked 34th in the world, and third in Canada for the field of mathematics.

In the <b>subject</b> <b>field</b> {{of economics and}} business, the 2017 U.S. News & World Report ranked Western 94th in the world, and sixth in Canada. Western was also noted particularly for their graduate's employment prospects.

2500|$|According to the Manual of Specialized Lexicographies a {{specialized}} dictionary, (also {{referred to as}} a technical dictionary) is a dictionary that focuses upon a specific <b>subject</b> <b>field.</b> Following the description, in The Bilingual LSP Dictionary, lexicographers categorize specialized dictionaries into three types. A multi-field dictionary broadly covers several subject fields (e.g. a business dictionary), a single-field dictionary narrowly covers one particular <b>subject</b> <b>field</b> (e.g. law), and a sub-field dictionary covers a more specialised field (e.g. constitutional law). For example, the 23-language Inter-Active Terminology for Europe is a multi-field dictionary, the American National Biography is a single-field, and the African American National Biography Project is a sub-field dictionary. In terms of the above coverage distinction between [...] "minimizing dictionaries" [...] and [...] "maximizing dictionaries", multi-field dictionaries tend to minimize coverage across subject fields (for instance, Oxford Dictionary of World Religions and Yadgar Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms) whereas single-field and sub-field dictionaries tend to maximize coverage within a limited <b>subject</b> <b>field</b> (The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology). A 'phonetic dictionary is one] that allows the reader to locate words by the [...] "way they sound", i.e. a dictionary that matches common or phonetic misspellings with the correct spelling of a word; such a dictionary uses pronunciation respelling to aid the search for or recognition of a word, and differs from a pronouncing dictionary, such as the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, which maps from a written word to its pronunciation in a chosen dialect.|$|E
50|$|Also, Nielsen 1994 {{distinguishes between}} the {{following}} types of dictionaries: An LSP dictionary that covers {{more than one}} <b>subject</b> <b>field</b> is called a multi-field dictionary, an LSP dictionary that covers one <b>subject</b> <b>field</b> (e.g. a dictionary of law) is called a single-field dictionary, and an LSP dictionary that covers part of a <b>subject</b> <b>field</b> (e.g. a dictionary of contract law) is called a sub-field dictionary.|$|E
50|$|Consequently, {{the best}} {{coverage}} of linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects within the <b>subject</b> <b>field</b> {{covered by a}} dictionary will {{be found in a}} sub-field dictionary. The best coverage of a <b>subject</b> <b>field</b> will then be to compile a number of sub-field dictionaries that together cover the entire subject.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} common types of {{specialized}} dictionary is what is often referred to in English as a technical dictionary and in German as a Fachwörterbuch. These dictionaries cover the terminology of a particular <b>subject</b> <b>field</b> or discipline. As described in Nielsen (1994), dictionaries of this type can be classified in various ways. A dictionary that covers more than one <b>subject</b> <b>field</b> is called a multi-field dictionary; one that covers one <b>subject</b> <b>field</b> is called a single-field dictionary; and one that covers a limited part of a <b>subject</b> <b>field</b> is called a sub-field dictionary. A technical dictionary that attempts to cover as much of the relevant terminology as possible is called a maximizing dictionary, whereas one that attempts to cover only a limited part of the relevant terminology is called a minimizing dictionary.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of single-field dictionaries {{is that they}} can easily be maximizing dictionary, i.e. attempt to cover as many terms of the <b>subject</b> <b>field</b> as possible without being a dictionary in several volumes. Consequently, single-fields dictionaries are ideal for extensive coverage of the linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects within a particular <b>subject</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose. : The {{present study}} {{is an attempt to}} find out the impact of self-citations on Impact Factor (IF) across disciplines. The study {{examines}} the number of research articles published across 27 major <b>subject</b> <b>fields</b> covered by SCImago, encompassing as many as 310 sub-disciplines. The study evaluates aspects like percentage of self-citations across each discipline, leading self-citing countries and continents, and the impact of self-citation on their IF. Scope. : The study is global in nature, as it evaluates the trend of self-citation and its impact on IF of all the major subject disciplines of the world, along with countries and continents. IF has been calculated for the year 2012 by analyzing the articles published during the years 2010 and 2011. Methodology/Approach. : The study is empirical in nature; as such, statistical and mathematical tools and techniques have been employed to work out the distribution across disciplines. The evaluation has been purely under-taken on the secondary data, retrieved from SCImago Journal and Country Ranking. Findings. : Self-citations play a very significant part in inflating IF. All the <b>subject</b> <b>fields</b> under study are influenced by the practice of self-citation, ranging from 33. 14 % to 52. 38 %. Compared to the social sciences and the humanities, <b>subject</b> <b>fields</b> falling under the purview of pure and applied sciences have a higher number of self-citations, but a far lesser percentage than the social sciences and humanities. Upon excluding self-citations, a substantial amount of change was observed in the IF of <b>subject</b> <b>fields</b> under study, as 18 (66. 66 %) out of 27 <b>subjects</b> <b>fields</b> faced shuffle in their rankings.
