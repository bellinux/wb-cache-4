In addition to that, the Liberal MEP supports the improvement of the image that Romania has at European level by carrying out an efficient work within the framework of the European legislature. As an MEP, she can address questions to the European Commission and make interpellations in order to request information regarding the way in which legislation is being enforced in the EU Member States or the way in which the Commission envisions solving a particular issue. The Regional Development Committee, where Mănescu is a coordinator from the ALDE group, is competent on matters regarding the regional and cohesion policy, in particular: the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund and all the other regional policy instruments of the Union; assessing the impact of other Union policies on economic and social cohesion; the coordination of the <b>structural</b> <b>instruments</b> of the Union; the outermost regions and the islands, as well as regarding trans-frontier and interregional cooperation; relations with the Committee of the Regions, interregional cooperation organisations, local and regional authorities.

The focus is particularly on the variability of financial and economic rates of return and how to integrate this information in the EU co- financing mechanism. We investigate, through the analysis of variance of co-financing rate, to which extent variability of rates is due to structural characteristics (sectors, countries) or to the existence of a residual variance due both to specificity of the project and discretional element of the appraisal method, which may constitute an information noise. We find that the variance of co-financing rate across countries is poorly explained by different composition of sectors of investment. This suggests the need to reinforce a more consistent approach to evaluation and co-financing. We suggest some possible solutions.

40|$|Articulated arm {{coordinate}} {{measuring machine}} (AACMM) is a specific robotic <b>structural</b> <b>instrument,</b> which uses D-H method {{for the purpose of}} kinematic modeling and error compensation. However, it is difficult for the existing error compensation models to describe various factors, which affects the accuracy of AACMM. In this paper, a modeling and error compensation method for AACMM is proposed based on BP Neural Networks. According to the available measurements, the poses of the AACMM are used as the input, and the coordinates of the probe are used as the output of neural network. To avoid tedious training and improve the training efficiency and prediction accuracy, a data acquisition strategy is developed according to the actual measurement behavior in the joint space. A neural network model is proposed and analyzed by using the data generated via Monte-Carlo method in simulations. The structure and parameter settings of neural network are optimized to improve the prediction accuracy and training speed. Experimental studies have been conducted to verify the proposed algorithm with neural network compensation, which shows that 97 % error of the AACMM can be eliminated after compensation. These experimental results have revealed the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and compensation method for AACMM...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{results of}} cost-benefit analysis (CBA) {{in a large}} sample of ISPA (<b>Structural</b> <b>Instrument</b> for Pre-Accession countries) projects co-financed by the European Union to support investment in transport and environment. The research {{focus is on the}} empirical analysis of the variability of financial and economic rates of return and how to integrate this information in the EU co-financing mechanism. We investigate to what extent the variability of expected returns and of EU co-financing rates is due to structural project characteristics (sectors, countries) or to other unexplained factors, including errors in the appraisal. We find that while the absolute level of grants is related to sectors, the EU co-financing rate depends on countries. There is no justification in economic analysis of such a country bias, because the variability of economic rate of returns is unrelated either to sector or country factors. These findings points to the need of a more consistent approach to evaluation and EU co-financing of infrastructure supported by the EU funds. We suggest possible improvements, based on the idea to offer an incentive to projects with high-expected economic␣rates of return relative to a benchmark and showing ex-post the realism of the initial analysis.

40|$|For several European states, {{including}} Romania, the European {{integration process}} has overlapped {{with the effects}} of the economic and financial crisis. The consequences of such a situation are apparently contradictory. On one hand, the crisis lowers the European integration process in view of achieving the performance imposed by the Single Market, the economic and administrative convergence etc. On the other hand, the possibility of accessing the European structural funds becomes a welcome financial resource for diminishing or stopping the effects of the crisis. The second alternative establishes new balances or imbalances at the local community level, with effect on the employment policies. The European <b>structural</b> <b>instruments</b> – Structural Funds, Cohesion Fund, EC initiatives – are associated with the effects induced in view to achieve the EU objectives such as: economic, social and territorial cohesion, economic growth, competitiveness, employment, sustainable development etc. The current paper aims to emphasise in a theoretic and empiric manner, the influences of these <b>structural</b> <b>instruments</b> on the employment policies at local level. At the same time, those influences will be correlated statistically {{with the effects of}} the financial crisis, obtaining a more comprehensive image concerning the consequences of the mix of national and EC policies for the economic integration and fight against the effects of the financial crisis for some EU states. The authors propose a model of local development based on the theory of the general balance, integrating the resources provided by the <b>structural</b> <b>instruments</b> and emphasizing their compensatory effects related to the financial crisis. The proposed model is empirically exemplified for some development regions in Romania, suggestive for general conclusions, of comparative nature, at European and international level...|$|E

We consider inference in non-parametric models and weakly identified <b>structural</b> models (weak <b>instruments).</b> We point out that many statistical problems, such as non-testable hypotheses, occur in these areas and are typically associated with asymptotic approximations. In non-parametric models, such problems include testing moments and inference under heteroscedasticity or serial dependence of unknown form. For weakly identified structural models, difficulties are typically associated with improper pivots, and we review recent developments aimed at proposing more reliable procedures, including alternative proposed statistics, bounds, projection, split-sampling, conditioning, Monte Carlo tests. ...|$|R
