30|$|If {{wireless}} {{cameras are}} to be used, there are two primary ways they can reach their processing/storage destination: via a <b>single-hop</b> <b>connection</b> (cameras connect directly to wireless router/receivers) or via multihop connections (cameras connect to other cameras and pass on data before reaching the router/receiver). Multi-hop networks impose additional complexity and hardware as well as increased latency, but gain flexibility and wireless coverage by essentially turning every camera into a repeater node; these are moresuited for cameras with on-board processing capabilities. Single-hop networks are recommended if it is viable (i.e., network routers can be installed in locations in which all cameras can reach) for purposes of lower latency and reduced hardware requirements.|$|E
40|$|Doctor of Philosopy (PhD) Wireless {{communication}} always attracts {{extensive research}} interest, {{as it is}} a core part of modern communication technology. During my PhD study, I have focused on two research areas of wireless communication: IEEE 802. 11 network performance analysis, and wireless cooperative retransmission. The first part of this thesis focuses on IEEE 802. 11 network performance analysis. Since IEEE 802. 11 technology is the most popular wireless access technology, IEEE 802. 11 network performance analysis is always an important research area. In this area, my work includes the development of three analytical models for various aspects of IEEE 802. 11 network performance analysis. First, a two-dimensional Markov chain model is proposed for analysing the performance of IEEE 802. 11 e EDCA (Enhanced Distributed Channel Access). With this analytical model, the saturated throughput is obtained. Compared with the existing analytical models of EDCA, the proposed model includes more correct details of EDCA, and accordingly its results are more accurate. This better accuracy is also proved by the simulation study. Second, another two-dimensional Markov chain model is proposed for analysing the coexistence performance of IEEE 802. 11 DCF (Distributed Coordination Function) and IEEE 802. 11 e EDCA wireless devices. The saturated throughput is obtained with the proposed analytical model. The simulation study verifies the proposed analytical model, and it shows that the channel access priority of DCF {{is similar to that of}} the best effort access category in EDCA in the coexistence environment. The final work in this area is a hierarchical Markov chain model for investigating the impact of data-rate switching on the performance of IEEE 802. 11 DCF. With this analytical model，the saturated throughput can be obtained. The simulation study verifies the accuracy of the model and shows the impact of the data-rate switching under different network conditions. A series of threshold values for the channel condition as well as the number of stations are obtained to decide whether the data-rate switching should be active or not. The second part of this thesis focuses on wireless cooperative retransmission. In this thesis, two uncoordinated distributed wireless cooperative retransmission strategies for <b>single-hop</b> <b>connection</b> are presented. In the proposed strategies, each uncoordinated cooperative neighbour randomly decide whether it should transmit to help the frame delivery depending on some pre-calculated optimal transmission probabilities. In Strategy 1, the source only transmits once in the first slot, and only the neighbours are involved in the retransmission attempts in the subsequent slots. In Strategy 2, both the source and the neighbours participate in the retransmission attempts. Both strategies are first analysed with a simple memoryless channel model, and the results show the superior performance of Strategy 2. With the elementary results for the memoryless channel model, a more realistic two-state Markov fading channel model is used to investigate the performance of Strategy 2. The simulation study verifies the accuracy of our analysis and indicates the superior performance of Strategy 2 compared with the simple retransmission strategy and the traditional two-hop strategy...|$|E
40|$|Voronoi Diagrams (VD) have {{recently}} been proposed {{as a way to}} enable Massively Multi-player On-line Games (MMOG) and Virtual Environments (VE) on fully Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) network architectures. Using typical two-dimensional varieties, the peers maintain direct <b>single-hop</b> <b>connections</b> to others in the game-world in a scalable manner. However, direct connections do not guarantee the timely delivery of update messages amongst peers. There is also the issue of fair game-play resolution between opposing players. Thus, as is standard industry practice, game-play arbitrators are needed. Arbitrators also incorporate lag-compensation techniques which improve the responsiveness felt by individual players, thereby enhancing their experience. The approach outlined in this short paper aims {{to bridge the gap between}} industry and academia, by introducing the use of an additional 3 rd dimension when deriving the VDs. Initial experimentation indicates that 3 D-VD is computationally feasible within the time constraints of a typical game. A discussion into several metrics that can act as the differentiating 3 rd dimension is also included...|$|R
40|$|A routing algorithm, {{utilizing}} two-hop relaying when necessary, {{is proposed}} {{to enhance the}} system capacity of {{code division multiple access}} (CDMA) cellular systems. Up to now, multihop relaying is applied to cellular systems mainly with the aim of decreasing the transmit power of each mobile station or extending the cell coverage area. Here, in this paper, potential benefit of multihop relaying is studied so as to increase the system capacity. A condition for the interference to be reduced by changing <b>single-hop</b> <b>connections</b> to two-hop connections is analyzed. In addition, a new route selection criterion maximizing the amount of interference reduction is proposed. Simulation results reveal that the proposed criterion is superior to the conventional criterion minimizing the total transmit power in respect of the amount of interference reduction. By using this criterion, an efficient routing algorithm for two-hop CDMA cellular systems is proposed to enhance the system capacity. Simulation results also indicate that by using the proposed routing algorithm in combination with a call admission control, the system capacity is increased even under heavy traffic conditions...|$|R
30|$|According to Ganguly et al. [17], if {{some or all}} wired {{connections}} in a NoC are replaced with wireless high-bandwidth <b>single-hop</b> <b>connections,</b> {{there will be a}} reduction in energy dissipation and latency, since these are caused by the multiple hops necessary to accomplish message exchange between distant cores. In order for the distance between cores not to increase a lot, it is suggested to split the network into smaller sub-networks as it grows. The cores in a sub-network can be interconnected via wires, since they will be physically close, and the communication between sub-networks is wireless. Also, Ganguly et al. [17] present a performance evaluation comparing NoC architectures with two different hybrid architectures (one was designed based on mesh topology and the other had a ring-star topology). For the comparisons, a 64 -core architecture was simulated in a cycle-precise network simulator. The workload was generated by packet injection, with uniformly distributed spatial traffic. The authors concluded that the proposed hybrid networks can achieve higher performances than the compared NoC architectures.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Awavelength-routed, {{optical network}} employs all-optical {{channels}} (lightpaths) on multiple wavelengths {{to establish a}} rearrangeable interconnection pattern (virtual topology) for transport of data. A lightpath may spanmultiple ber-links, and may be routed optically at an intermediate node without undergoing electronic conversion. We examine the problem of establishing a set of lightpaths in an optical network, which employs a passive wavelength routing device called a Latin Router (LR). Latin Routers are attractive for optical network design because of their fault-tolerance and low cost, but make traditional routing algorithms difcult to implement due {{to the complexity of}} the constraints they impose on legitimate routes and colors. We employ a local search algorithm to search the space of virtual topologies in order to satisfy a maximum number of given lightpath requests. We use the same algorithm to maximize the number of <b>single-hop</b> <b>connections</b> for a given network. We showthat the algorithm can satisfy a high percentage of lightpaths under low to moderate network loads. Experiments reveal that we can establish O(N) lightpaths in an optical network with N nodes. We believethat our work is the rst known attempt at designing optical wide-area networks usin...|$|R
30|$|During {{the past}} few years, {{vehicular}} networks have received increasing attentions due to their potentials in enhancing road safety, improving traffic efficiency, and providing mobile infotainment services[1]. In vehicular networks, the information exchange among the vehicles can be typically performed in two modes, namely, vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V 2 I). The V 2 V communications do not rely {{on the existence of}} the central unit, and the vehicles can communicate with each other directly via either <b>single-hop</b> or multi-hop <b>connections.</b> Comparably, in V 2 I communications, data is transferred between the vehicle and the fixed infrastructure deployed along the roadside, which is often called the roadside unit (RSU) in the literature. The co-existence of these two modes makes the vehicular networks a hybrid network that supports both the infrastructure-based and ad hoc communications.|$|R
40|$|Wireless mesh {{networks}} (WMNs) {{have been}} proposed to provide cheap, easily deployable and robust Internet access. The dominant Internet-bound traffic from clients causes a congestion bottleneck around the gateway, which can significantly limit the throughput of the WMN clients in accessing the Internet. In this paper, we present MeshCache, a transparent caching system for WMNs that exploits the locality in client Internet-bound traffic to mitigate the bottleneck effect at the gateway, thereby improving client perceived performance. MeshCache leverages {{the fact that a}} WMN typically spans a small geographic area and hence mesh routers are easily over-provisioned with CPU, memory, and disk storage, and extends the individual wireless mesh routers in a WMN with built-in content caching functionality. It then performs cooperative caching among the wireless mesh routers. We explore two architecture designs for MeshCache: (1) caching at every client access mesh router upon file download, and (2) caching at each mesh router along the route the Internet traffic travels, which requires breaking a single end-to-end transport <b>connection</b> into multiple <b>single-hop</b> transport <b>connections</b> along the route. We also leverage the abundant research results from cooperative web caching in the Internet in designing cache selection protocols for efficiently locating caches containing data objects for these two architectures. We further compare these two MeshCache designs with caching at the gateway router only. Through extensive simulations and evaluations using a prototype implementation on a testbed, we find that MeshCache can significantly improve the performance of client nodes in WMNs. In particular, our experiments with a Squid-based MeshCache implementation deployed on the MAP mesh network testbed with 15 routers show that compared to caching at the gateway only, the MeshCache architecture with hop-by-hop caching reduces the load at the gateway by 38 %, improves the average client throughput by 170 %, and increases the number of transfers that achieve a throughput greater than 1 Mbps by a factor of 3...|$|R
40|$|When built, quantum {{repeater}} networks {{will require}} classical network protocols {{to control the}} quantum operations. However, existing work on repeaters {{has focused on the}} quantum operations themselves, with less attention paid to the contents, semantics, ordering and reliability of the classical control messages. In this work we define and describe our implementation of the classical control protocols. The state machines and packet sequences for the three protocol layers are presented, and operation confirmed by running the protocols over simulations of the physical network. We also show that proper management of the resources in a bottleneck link allows the aggregate throughput of two end-to-end flows to substantially exceed that of a single flow. Our layered architectural framework will support independent evolution of the separate protocol layers. Networks of quantum repeaters utilize three concepts to execute a distributed algorithm that creates entangled quantum states between nodes that are far apart: a basic entanglement mechanism which depends on the physical implementation, error management (in this work, we study a method known as purification), and finally a quantum state propagation layer (here we implement entanglement swapping, which builds multi-hop <b>connections</b> from <b>single-hop</b> <b>connections).</b> Some researchers are investigating approaches that are substantially different from entanglement swapping [30, 24, 19]. Here we focus on swapping, but the layered architecture approach is broadly applicable, allowing other implementations to replace only a single layer in the protocol stack. Previous work primarily focused on the physical and mathematical tools for building repeaters. Classical information is also needed to enable teleportation and swapping, as many quantum operations are not deterministic, and results of quantum measurements need to be reported to distant partners before further operations can proceed. Also, operations {{in the middle of the}} network must be coordinated to route and swap properly. This requires classical messages to make operations robust, but message propagation times penalize performance. Even though this delay is usually included in repeater simulations, prior work has not defined the protocols in detail, especially with respect to how all of the nodes make consistent decisions in a timely fashion. In this work, we introduce a protocol stack for networks of quantum repeaters that considers all the necessary classical messages and which can be easily adapted for different approaches at all three protocol layers. We run simulations of competing flows on a dumbbell topology in order to increase our confidence in the behavior of our network protocols. By adjusting the fidelity thresholds required for entanglement swapping, we show that some configurations boost the aggregate throughput for multiple flows significantly above the maximum for a single flow, taking advantage of resources that would otherwise sit idle. The operation of such complex networks and such delicate tuning of the system without formal protocol definitions would not be possible. Previous work has also concentrated almost exclusively on the dedicated use of a single line or chain of repeaters, delivering Bell pairs only to the two nodes at the ends of the chain. Networks, however, typically have more than two end points, and allow any pair of these end nodes to communicate. More topologically complex networks, with numerous end nodes, are obviously much more scalable than connecting every possible pair of nodes using a dedicated line of repeaters. we investigate how classical multiplexing schemes translate to the domain of quantum repeaters, in order to manage shared resources and active communication flows of data from different stations. We simulate four sharing protocols in a complex network with competing traffic. Circuit switching gives any individual flow the best performance, but makes poor use of the overall network and is inflexible. We use circuit switching as our baseline case to compare time division multiplexing, buffer space multiplexing, and statistical multiplexing, and show that all multiplexing schemes are better than circuit switching. For the particular network simulated, we find that statistical multiplexing outperforms time division multiplexing by 28 % and buffer space multiplexing by 13 %. We find that all three multiplexing schemes are fair; each flow is penalized a similar percentage of its throughput as the the total number of users in the network increases. Finally, statistical multiplexing requires no network-wide coordination of the use of quantum memory or channels, and is easier to implement than a robust, scalable scheme for the other protocols. Our current results suggest that the best strategy for quantum repeater networks is statistical multiplexing. (This is in fact the quantum analogue of the basis on which the Internet works.) However, our current simulations are done with no degradation of memory over time, using the assumption of quantum error-corrected memory at each repeater; inclusion of decoherence and a finite qubit lifetime remains as future work. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2011 - 09 - 27; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(情報理工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 情報理工学系研究科電子情報学専...|$|R
40|$|The {{emerging}} vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) offer {{a variety}} of applications and new potential markets related to safety, convenience and entertainment, however, they suffer from a number of challenges not shared so deeply by other types of existing networks, particularly, in terms of mobility of nodes, and end-to-end quality of service (QoS) provision. Although several existing works in the literature have attempted to provide efficient protocols at different layers targeted mostly for safety applications, there remain many barriers to be overcome in order to constrain the widespread use of such networks for non-safety applications, specifically, for video streaming: 1) impact of high speed mobility of nodes on end-to-end QoS provision; 2) cross-layer protocol design while keeping low computational complexity; 3) considering customer-oriented QoS metrics in the design of protocols; and 4) maintaining seamless <b>single-hop</b> and multi-hop <b>connection</b> between the destination vehicle and the road side unit (RSU) while network is moving. This thesis addresses each of the above limitations in design of cross-layer protocols for video streaming application. 1) An adaptive MAC retransmission limit selection scheme is proposed to improve the performance of IEEE 802. 11 p standard MAC protocol for video streaming applications over VANETs. A multi-objective optimization framework, which jointly minimizes the probability of playback freezes and start-up delay of the streamed video at the destination vehicle by tuning the MAC retransmission limit with respect to channel statistics as well as packet transmission rate, is applied at road side unit (RSU). Two-hop transmission is applied in zones in which the destination vehicle is not within the transmission range of any RSU. In the multi-hop scenario, we discuss the computation of access probability used in the MAC adaptation scheme and propose a cross-layer path selection scheme; 2) We take advantage of similarity between multi-hop urban VANETs in dense traffic conditions and mesh connected networks. First, we investigate an application-centric routing scheme for video streaming over mesh connected overlays. Next, we introduce the challenges of urban VANETs compared to mesh networks and extend the proposed scheme in mesh network into a protocol for urban VANETs. A classification-based method is proposed to select an optimal path for video streaming over multi-hop mesh networks. The novelty is to translate the path selection over multi-hop networks to a standard classification problem. The classiﬁcation is based on minimizing average video packet distortion at the receiving nodes. The classifiers are trained offline using a vast collection of video sequences and wireless channel conditions in order to yield optimal performance during real time path selection. Our method substantially reduces the complexity of conventional exhaustive optimization methods and results in high quality (low distortion). Next, we propose an application-centric routing scheme for real-time video transmission over urban multi-hop vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) scenarios. Queuing based mobility model, spatial traffic distribution and prob- ability of connectivity for sparse and dense VANET scenarios are taken into consideration in designing the routing protocol. Numerical results demonstrate the gain achieved by the proposed routing scheme versus geographic greedy forwarding in terms of video frame distortion and streaming start-up delay in several urban communication scenarios for various vehicle entrance rate and traﬃc densities; and 3) ﬁnally, the proposed quality-driven routing scheme for delivering video streams is combined with a novel IP management scheme. The routing scheme aims to optimize the visual quality of the transmitted video frames by minimizing the distortion, the start-up delay, and the frequency of the streaming freezes. As the destination vehicle is in motion, it is unrealistic to assume that the vehicle will remain connected to the same access router (AR) for the whole trip. Mobile IP management schemes can beneﬁt from the proposed multi-hop routing protocol in order to adapt proxy mobile IPv 6 (PMIPv 6) for multi-hop VANET for video streaming applications. The proposed cross-layer protocols can signiﬁcantly improve the video streaming quality {{in terms of the number}} of streaming freezes and start-up delay over VANETs while achieving low computational complexity by using pattern classification methods for optimization...|$|R
