50|$|NASA makes {{significant}} use {{of touch}} fasteners. Each space shuttle flew equipped with ten thousand inches of a <b>special</b> <b>fastener</b> made of Teflon loops, polyester hooks, and glass backing. Touch fasteners are widely used, from the astronauts' suits, to anchoring equipment. In the near weightless conditions in orbit, {{hook and loop}} fasteners are used to temporarily hold objects and keep them from floating away. A patch is used inside astronauts' helmets where {{it serves as a}} nose scratcher. During mealtimes astronauts use trays that attach to their thighs using springs and fasteners.|$|E
5000|$|Fritz Fiedler's 1951 {{proposal}} for a small BMW passenger car remained on the shelf, and the BMW 501 was unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show, though [...] "development issues" [...] delayed the start of production until late 1952. [...] Powered at this stage by a compact 6-cylinder engine not massively changed since it had {{first appeared in the}} BMW 326 in 1936, the BMW 501 for 1952 was seen as seriously underpowered, and high warranty charges for the early cars indicated that it was also seriously underdeveloped at launch, reflecting the manufacturer's continuing acute cash shortage. [...] Mercedes-Benz were also cash strapped, and their contender in the six cylinder class was in many respects a less elaborate design, but the Württembergers had invested in a much more modern engine. Applying a simplistic but telling comparison, contrasting the Mercedes-Benz 220 of 1952 with the BMW 501, Der Spiegel reported a power-to-weight ratio for the Mercedes of 16 Kg of car weight per unit of declared Horsepower (Pferdestärke / PS), whereas the 65 PS engine of the BMW resulted in an anemic power-to-weight ratio of 19 Kg of car weight per unit of declared horsepower, [...] [...] Two years later a V8 engined 2.6 litre version addressed some of the criticisms of the BMW's sluggish performance, but the overall market for large cars in West Germany was still small, and it was dominated by Mercedes-Benz. BMW found customers for only about 3,000 cars annually. [...] In some respects BMW displayed a bizarre [...] "money no object" [...] approach to their luxury car: a perfectly adequate fastener for the luggage locker (boot/trunk) could have been produced for 8 Marks, but BMW insisted on developing a superior fastener costed at 98 Marks. [...] The high cost of the <b>special</b> <b>fastener</b> no doubt reflected the relatively small number of cars over which development costs had to be amortised. Low production volumes and, especially in the early 1950s, high warranty costs meant that the BMW 501 was never as profitable as the board had hoped.|$|E
40|$|On June 16, 2005 the {{re-entry}} module of the Russian FOTON-M 2 spacecraft made {{a successful}} landing after a 16 -day microgravity mission in space. On board {{was also the}} “KERAMIK” experiment by the Institute of Structures and Design of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Stuttgart, Germany. The re-entry technology experiment was aiming for the first flight of a Thermal Protection System (TPS) with it´s structural components designed and manufactured fully in C/C-SiC, a Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) material developed by DLR. The experiment had a surface diameter of 340 mm and was located on {{the exterior of the}} re-entry spacecraft embedded into the ablative heat shield. The emphasis of the experiment was on the system aspects of the TPS design. It included two stiffened surface panels each fixed to three structural posts with a <b>special</b> <b>fastener</b> type, all components made from the C/C-SiC material. The experiment deliberately included a gap between the panels and a surrounding close-out ring to test the performance of a dedicated seal in that area. In addition to the structural aspects of the experiment, a set of different oxidation protection coatings was applied to the surface of one of the panels to conduct a comparative test under flight conditions. The position of the experiment was carefully selected with regard to the aerothermodynamic environment. Since the experiment technology aims at re-usable vehicles, a position in the stagnation area of the ballistic re-entry module would have resulted in excessive heat loads. Therefore a location was preferred at an angle of almost 90 ° relative to the flight direction. The temperature data that was measured during re-entry shows that the surface temperature was close to 1500 °C, which was in the targeted range. The structural components {{on the surface of the}} experiment were in an excellent condition as a visual inspection immediately after landing revealed...|$|E

50|$|In restaurants, wine {{is usually}} {{served by the}} litre, 750 mL or 500 mL bottle, but a wine glass is {{measured}} in ounces. Similarly, fast food restaurants (e.g. McDonald's Quarter Pounder) often advertise measurements of food and drink in US customary units, but converted to metric units, because either the containers are made to US standards, or the franchise is US-based and uses a standard size for its products. Thus in Canada a 20 US fluid ounce bottled soft drink is labelled as 591 mL (or occasionally rounded up to 600 mL). Beer in bottles continues to be 12 imperial fluid ounces (labelled as 341 mL), but beer in cans is filled to 12 US fluid ounces (labelled as 355 mL). There is also a larger sized beer bottle which is labelled as containing 1.18 L. Some of these package sizes have been introduced since Canadian metrication began; for example, the traditional Canadian soft drink can was 10 imperial fluid ounces (284 mL), later marketed as 280 mL. Only in the early 1990s did the US-derived 355 mL size displace it. Television sets and computer screens are also measured in inches. Standard and <b>special</b> <b>fasteners</b> like alloys, nuts, bolts, washers, studs, tapping, self drilling screw and socket screware are often quoted in both imperial and metric; products range from 2/56 in diameter up to 4 in.|$|R

For shallower pitches, down to 1.5%, a fix system with no exposed through <b>fasteners,</b> <b>special</b> side laps and preferably no end laps should be used. For low pitch roof, ponding is a potential problem that must be considered at the design stage {{in order to avoid the}} deleterious effects of prolonged soaking and the increased loading, due to the weight of the water.|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} devote {{to the problem}} of {{accuracy}} increase for estimation change of powder constructive materials? (PCM) physical-mechanical characteristics (PMC) using acoustic method of nondestructive testing (NDT) and development of a dedicated system based on the method of measuring velocity analysis of ultrasonic vibrations in PCM.
