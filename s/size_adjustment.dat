40|$|The {{current review}} {{addresses}} the following 3 frequently encountered {{challenges in the}} design and analysis of population pharmacokinetic studies in pediatrics: (1) body <b>size</b> <b>adjustments</b> during the development of pharmacostatistical models, (2) design and validation of limited sampling strategies, and (3) the integration of historical priors in data analysis and trial simulation. <b>Size</b> <b>adjustments</b> with empiric approaches based on body weight or body surface area have frequently proven as a pragmatic tool to overcome large size differences in a pediatric study population. Allometric <b>size</b> <b>adjustments,</b> however, provide a more mechanistic, physiologically based approach that, if used a priori, allows delineation of the effect of size from that of other covariates that show a high degree of collinearity. The frequent lack of dense data sets in pediatric clinical pharmacology because of ethical and logistic constraints in study design can be overcome with the application of D-optimality-based limited sampling schemes in combination with Bayesian and nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approaches. Empirically based dose selection and clinical trial designs for pediatric clinical pharmacology studies can be improved by applying clinical trial simulation techniques, especially if they integrate adult and pediatric in vitro and/or in vivo data as historic priors. Although integration of these concepts and techniques in population pharmacokinetic analyses is not only limited to pediatric research, their application allows researchers to overcome some major hurdles frequently encountered in pharmacokinetic studies in pediatrics and, thus, provides the basis for additional clinical pharmacology research in this previously insufficiently studied fraction of the general population...|$|R

FAST TCP makes larger steps when the system is further from equilibrium and smaller steps near equilibrium. This improves the speed of convergence and the stability.|$|R

The new TOXMAP also has improved U.S. Census layers and availability by Census Tract (2000 and 2010), Canadian National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) data, U.S. commercial nuclear power plants, as well as improved and updated congressional district boundaries.|$|E
50|$|The SSh-40 was {{the last}} and most {{commonly}} seen in-service helmet used by the Soviet Union during World War II. The only external difference between the SSh-39 and the SSh-40 were the six rivets {{near the bottom of}} the helmet, as opposed to the three near the top of the SSh-39 shell. Rivet placement of the SSh-40 was due to a newly introduced liner, simpler and more sturdy than the previous versions. The liner consisted of three (later four during post-war) cloth or oilcloth pads connected with a cotton drawstring for <b>size</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The chinstrap was cloth and connected to d-rings on each side of the shell by tabs. The chinstrap ends were connected with a slip buckle, and a semi-circular metal piece was clamped to the end of the long chinstrap. Unlike the M-36 and SSh-39, the SSh-40 was only manufactured in three sizes, 1-3. The SSh-40 was supplemented by the SSh-60 and finally replaced by the SSh-68.|$|E

Internal pilot study, a kind of adaptive design, has gained increased attention for its allowing for sample <b>size</b> <b>adjustment,</b> especially blinded sample <b>size</b> <b>adjustment</b> that do not affect the type I error rate. Several methods were proposed to implement internal pilot design {{in recent years and}} some software emerges to simulate or implement it. But most of the software is only running on a stand-alone terminal or Client/Server(C/S) mode. We develop a system to simulate it based on Browser/Server(B/S) mode and realized on web. It allows the web users to input corresponding parameters from the web browser such as Internet Explorer to make simulations. The system was constructed with generic database schema design method and coded with Microsoft Visual Basic and Active Server Pages (ASP) programming languages. Web users on internet can use the system to make blinded variance estimate, sample <b>size</b> <b>adjustment</b> and randomization test for internal pilot study. The application of the simulation is demonstrated through an example. Not only blinded sample <b>size</b> <b>adjustment</b> is implemented but also a randomization test is performed.

40|$|We {{consider}} non-response {{models for}} a single categorical response with categorical covariates whose values are always observed. We present Bayesian methods for ignorable models and a particular non-ignorable model, and we argue that standard methods of model comparison are inappropriate for comparing ignorable and non-ignorable models. Uncertainty about ignorability of non-response is incorporated by introducing parameters describing the extent of non-ignorability into a pattern mixture specification and integrating over the prior uncertainty associated with these parameters. Our approach is illustrated using polling data from the 1992 British general election panel survey.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine recent {{behavior}} of the Japanese stock market from 1975 through 1995. The goal {{of this study is}} to provide insight into the particular behaviors observed and document possible explanations in light of the work presented. Specific contributions are listed below. (1) We discuss the current research on the Japanese stock market, contrarian investment strategies, the relationship of financial variables to stock returns, and <b>size</b> <b>adjustment</b> procedures. (2) We extend the study of Chang, McLeavey, and Rhee (1995) on the Japanese stock market through 1995. Their original study spanned the 17 year period between 1975 and 1991 and documented empirical evidence on the short-term profitability of a contrarian investment strategy in the Japanese stock market. We investigate a longer time horizon of 21 years, between 1975 and 1995, and determine if the short-term profitability still exists after the recent bear market. (3) We investigate a comprehensive <b>size</b> <b>adjustment</b> procedure documented by Chopra, Lakonishok, and Ritter (1992) that purges stocks that are in the extreme portfolios (winners and losers) before forming the size match deciles. Past research has documented significant relationships between size and stock returns. This technique is used to prevent the possibility of overadjusting for size and not detecting an overreaction effect. (4) We explore the development and usage of a new <b>size</b> <b>adjustment</b> procedure based on regression. We compare the results to the variation of the size matched decile technique developed by Dimson and Marsh (1986) and utilized by Chang, McLeavey, and Rhee (1995) in their study of the Japanese stock market. We further explore the new <b>size</b> <b>adjustment</b> technique based on regression incorporating the purging technique utilized by Chopra, Lakonishok, and Ritter (1992). (5) We investigate a particular contrarian investment strategy on the Japanese stock market and perform a multivariate analysis to determine whether financial data can be utilized to explain the short-term profitability of this contrarian investment strategy. (6) Finally, we provide a research summary and present recommendations for further study and research. ...|$|E
