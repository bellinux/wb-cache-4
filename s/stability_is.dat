5|$|The {{relevance}} of primary implant stability decreases gradually with regrowth of bone tissue around the implant {{in the first}} weeks after surgery, leading to secondary stability. Secondary <b>stability</b> <b>is</b> different from the initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into the implant (osseointegration). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary <b>stability</b> <b>is</b> critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. Regrowth usually occurs during the 3–4 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure.|$|E
5|$|Boron carbide and cubic {{boron nitride}} powders {{are widely used}} as abrasives. Boron nitride is a {{material}} isoelectronic to carbon. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN {{is used as a}} high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name borazon, is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only slightly smaller than, but its chemical <b>stability</b> <b>is</b> superior, to that of diamond. Heterodiamond (also called BCN) is another diamond-like boron compound.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride is a heat- and {{chemically}} resistant refractory compound of boron and nitrogen with the chemical formula BN. It exists in various crystalline forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon lattice. The hexagonal form corresponding to graphite {{is the most}} stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic (sphalerite structure) variety analogous to diamond is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical <b>stability</b> <b>is</b> superior. The rare wurtzite BN modification is similar to lonsdaleite and may even be harder than the cubic form.|$|E

40|$|Synopsis Film {{layers of}} {{seventeen}} commercially available sunscreen products and sixteen active ingredients on stratum corneum sheets were spectrophotometrically monitored {{before and after}} simulated solar irradiation. Fixed irradiation doses were given within the daily terrestrial limits. From {{the changes in the}} absorption spectra after irradiation the spectral <b>stability</b> <b>was</b> determined. The spectral stability reflects the photochemical stability and the assay quickly provides an insight in the sunscreen's stability towards (solar) radiation in situ. Good to excellent spectral <b>stability</b> <b>was</b> observed for the benzophenones, paraaminobenzoic acid and its esters, homomenthylsalicylate, guanine, 2 -phenylbenzimidazol- 5 -sulphonic acid (potassium salt) and guiazulene.

Poor spectral <b>stability</b> <b>was</b> exhibited by phenylsalicylate and 4 -isopropyldibenzoylmethane. Among the commercial products good to poor spectral <b>stability</b> <b>was</b> established.

He oversaw the league's course of direction through two player strikes, and the modern league's financial <b>stability</b> <b>is</b> in great part due to his leadership. He held influence for over a decade, before stepping back due to criticism of what other owners saw as his overly-secretive ways.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune {{are made of}} {{extremely}} dark material, likely organic compounds processed by radiation, similar to that found in the rings of Uranus. The proportion of dust in the rings (between 20% and 70%) is high, while their optical depth is low to moderate, at less than 0.1. Uniquely, the Adams ring includes five distinct arcs, named Fraternité, Égalité 1 and 2, Liberté, and Courage. The arcs occupy a narrow range of orbital longitudes and are remarkably stable, having changed only slightly since their initial detection in 1980. How the arcs are stabilized is still under debate. However, their <b>stability</b> <b>is</b> probably related to the resonant interaction between the Adams ring and its inner shepherd moon, Galatea.|$|E
5|$|All but two {{elements}} up to bismuth (element 83) have an isotope that is practically stable for all purposes ("classically stable"), with the exceptions being technetium and promethium (elements 43 and 61). All elements from polonium (element 84) onward are measurably radioactive. 232Th {{is one of}} the three nuclides beyond bismuth (the other two being 235U and 238U) that have half-lives measured in billions of years; its half-life is 14.05billionyears, about three times the age of the earth, and slightly longer than the age of the universe. Four-fifths of the thorium present at Earth's formation has survived to the present. 232Th is the only isotope of thorium occurring in quantity in nature, and thorium is usually considered to be a mononuclidic element. Its <b>stability</b> <b>is</b> attributed to its closed nuclear shell with 142 neutrons. Thorium has a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition, with atomic weight 232.0377(4). It is one of only three radioactive elements (along with protactinium and uranium) that occur in large enough quantities on Earth for this to be possible.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{computer}} models, {{the presence of}} the Moon appears to stabilize the obliquity of the Earth, which may help the planet to avoid dramatic climate changes. This <b>stability</b> <b>is</b> achieved because the Moon increases the precession rate of the Earth's spin axis (that is, the precession motion of the ecliptic), thereby avoiding resonances between the precession of the spin and precession of the planet's orbital plane relative to that of Jupiter. However, as the semimajor axis of the Moon's orbit continues to increase, this stabilizing effect will diminish. At some point, perturbation effects will probably cause chaotic variations in the obliquity of the Earth, and the axial tilt may change by angles as high as 90° from the plane of the orbit. This is expected to occur between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E

25|$|Slope <b>stability</b> <b>is</b> the {{potential}} of soil covered slopes to withstand and undergo movement. <b>Stability</b> <b>is</b> determined by the balance of shear stress and shear strength.

Alternatively, shear strength may be decreased by weathering, changes in pore water pressure, and organic material.|$|E
