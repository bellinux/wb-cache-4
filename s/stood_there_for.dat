500|$|One {{formality}} left were New York's late-in-the-season primary {{elections on}} September 12, {{which in this}} case merely served to ratify the state party conventions' choices. [...] Lazio won unopposed, while Clinton won 82percent of the vote in easily defeating unknown Manhattan doctor Mark McMahon, who ran on the grounds that [...] "the Clintons have tried to hijack the Democratic Party." [...] For her part, Clinton said that she was [...] "surprised, in a way [...] I <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> a minute, staring at my name." [...] In any case, the general election was already well underway.|$|E
500|$|Satisfied was {{released}} through Slanted Records on August 26, 2008, and debuted {{at its peak}} positions of number 116 on the Billboard 200 and number three on the Billboard Top Christian Albums charts. [...] First week sales nearly doubled those of DecembeRadio. [...] The album cover {{was the product of}} a spontaneous suggestion from the band's manager on the day of a photoshoot. [...] Another photo had been slated for the album cover, but the band found a swamp and acted on their manager's idea. [...] "We went down there, took off our shoes, rolled up our jeans a little bit and walked right into the water—and <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> 45 minutes while we got our picture taken. It's a good thing we did it because when we got the pictures back, those were by far our favorite!" [...] said Bunn.|$|E
500|$|The {{commission}} was tardy in giving the final {{order for the}} statue to Bartlett, so late {{that it was impossible}} to have the final bronze piece ready in time; a one-third model was only completed in May. [...] According to Q.David Bowers, [...] "the French are at home in such problems." [...] The {{commission was}} able to have a full-sized plaster model ready by July 4 by sawing the scale model in pieces [...] and distributing them to various workshops, that made enlargements in plaster. Brought together, the plaster pieces fitted perfectly. [...] This assembly was ceremoniously dedicated in the Place du Carrousel on July 4, 1900. [...] Afterwards, Bartlett was dissatisfied with certain aspects of the design, and changed them. [...] His bronze statue erected there in 1908 differs considerably from the statue depicted on the coin. [...] Changes made included the elimination of Lafayette's three-cornered hat, and the position of the raised arm and sword. The statue <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> almost eighty years, but was displaced in the 1980s during the excavations for I.M. Pei's glass pyramid at the Louvre. [...] It now stands on Cours-la-Reine in Paris, along the River Seine.|$|E

5000|$|For {{some years}} local {{children}} exploited the ticket stops at Spa Road.

60|$|What {{a breath}} I drew! But I felt so weak and shaky that I {{had to take}} hold {{of the side of}} the scow, and <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> a while before I waded ashore. The boy who was {{standing}} by me was Rectus. He did not have that name then, and I didn't know him.|$|R
500|$|Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith charity premieres {{took place}} in Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C., Boston, Denver, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Miami on Thursday, May 12, 2005; and on May 13, 2005, there were two {{additional}} charity premiere screenings in George Lucas's hometown of Modesto.The official premiere was at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival (out of competition) on May 16. Its theatrical release in most other countries took place on May 19 {{to coincide with the}} 1999 release of [...] (the 1977 release of A New Hope and the 1983 release of Return of the Jedi were also released on the same day and month, six years apart). The global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas claimed one week before the premiere that it may have cost the U.S. economy approximately US$627 million in lost productivity because of employees who took a day off or reported in sick. Grauman's Chinese Theatre, a traditional venue for the Star Wars films, did not show it. However, a line of people <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> more than a month hoping to convince someone to change this. Most of them took advantage of an offer to see the film at a nearby cinema, ArcLight Cinemas (formerly the [...] "Cinerama Dome"). On May 16, the Empire Cinema in London's Leicester Square hosted a day-long Star Wars marathon showing of all six films; an army of Imperial stormtroopers [...] "guarded" [...] the area, and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra gave a free concert of Star Wars music.|$|E
2500|$|... “My {{father in}} law {{went to meet}} the Bashi-Bаzouk when the village was {{surrounded}} by the men of Ahmet Aga, {{who said that he}} wanted all the arms laid down. Trendafil went to collect them from the villagers. When he surrendered the arms, they shot him with a gun and the bullet scratched his eye. Then I heard Ahmet Aga command with his own mouth for Trendafil to be impaled and burnt. The words he used were [...] "Shishak aor" [...] which is Turkish for [...] "to put on a skewer (as a shish kebab). After that, they took all the money he had, undressed him, gouged his eyes, pulled out his teeth and impaled him slowly on a stake, until it came out of his mouth. Then they roasted him while he was still alive. He lived for half-an-hour during this terrible scene. At the time, I was near Ahmet Aga with other Bulgarian women. We were surrounded by Bashi-Bozouk, who had us surrounded, and forced us to watch what was happening to Trendafil.“ One of her children, Vladimir, who was still a baby at his mother's breast, was impaled on a sword in front of her eyes. “At the time this was happening, Ahmet Aga's son took my child from my back and cut him to pieces, there in front of me. The burnt bones of Trendafil <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> one month and only then they were buried.” ...|$|E

If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced {{you have a chance to}} swim to the other side." [...] The donor heart came from a young woman, Denise Darvall, who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town. On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear. [...] Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall's father for Denise's heart to be used in the transplant attempt. The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. [...] When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower's technique. [...] Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins. [...] Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard. Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, [...] "Chris <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> a few moments, watching, then stood back and said, 'It works.'" ...|$|E

50|$|At war's end, General Sir Miles Dempsey {{paid the}} {{following}} tribute:"The Military Policeman became such a well known figure on every {{road to the}} battlefield that his presence became taken for granted.

60|$|The {{young man}} <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> a while waiting, {{and then walked}} off with a loud laugh.|$|E

6000|$|He <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> silent <b>for</b> a moment, looking, not at her, but at {{the costly}} {{ornaments}} which stood {{at the foot of}} the huge pier-glass over the fireplace.
