40|$|Many {{cases of}} {{cracking}} and detachment {{of the concrete}} surface have appeared in concrete floors, namely pavements where surface hardeners were used, especially in car parks, industrial areas and warehouses. This paper studies the behaviour of ten different base concretes mixtures made with two chemical admixtures and four additions, when a quartz <b>surface</b> <b>hardener</b> is applied. The objective is to identify the relevant parameters of the concrete constituents that influence the open time. Results show {{that the type of}} chemical admixture used to fabricate the concrete is important, but also the kind of admixture due to the water available to make the interconnection between the base concrete and <b>surface</b> <b>hardener...</b>|$|E
40|$|Many {{cases of}} {{cracking}} and detachment {{of the concrete}} surface have appeared in concrete floors where <b>surface</b> <b>hardeners</b> were used in Portugal. The main causes for cracking and delamination of trowelled concrete pavements are several and {{it is essential to}} control bleeding and the time available to perform the finishing operations. Several base concretes were made with different chemical admixtures and one type of <b>surface</b> <b>hardeners.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} evaluating the influence of the “open time” for each chemical admixture. Results show that the type of chemical admixture has a great importance in the control of the “open time” and consequently avoiding cracking and detachment...|$|R
40|$|Carbonated {{cement paste}} {{surfaces}} were characterised prior to application of surface treatments. Their chemical and physical properties varied with {{distance from the}} surface and method of carbonation. From the surface inwards the pH of expressed pore solutions and porosity were observed to increase. Hardness increased after natural carbonation, but decreased after accelerated carbonation. Generally, accelerated carbonation caused more extreme changes. Investigations were carried out on four concrete surface hardening treatments; two sodium silicates and two silicofluorides. These treatments penetrated and hardened the surface of naturally dried uncarbonated cement paste to a depth fo 250 m. Silicofluorides reacted with uncarbonated and carbonated cement pastes to form calcium fluoride. The question of how sodium silicates harden the surface remains unanswered. <b>Surface</b> <b>hardeners</b> do not significantly affect the rate of carbonation, and are unsuitable for re-alkalising carbonated cement paste. Water repellent treatments studied include a silane, a siloxane and a silicone. The silane exhibited the maximum penetration, up to 24 mm under favourable conditions, but penetration in all cases was limited by moisture in the substrate. Water repellent treatments slow down water vapour diffusion but, with time, internal moisture levels should reflect external relative humidities. Water repellents {{may be used to}} reduce carbonation-induced corrosion where ingress of moisture from intermittent wetting may be slowed. However, treatment with water repellents can temporarily push the carbonation front deeper into the concrete...|$|R
