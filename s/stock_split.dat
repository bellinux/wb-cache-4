500|$|Some tax protesters {{have cited}} the U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} {{in the case of}} Eisner v.

In the case of this kind of [...] "dividend" [...] the stockholder does not receive anything or realize any additional value. For example, if a stockholder owns 100 shares of stock having a value of $4 per share, the total value is $400. If the corporation declares, say, a [...] "two for one" [...] stock dividend that is essentially similar to a <b>stock</b> <b>split</b> (and the corporation distributes no money or other property), the stockholder now has 200 shares with a value of $2 each, which is still $400 in value - i.e., no increase in value and no income.
