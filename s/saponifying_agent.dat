50|$|In late 1888, {{metallic}} soaps were tried. At first a lead stearate was used, but in {{the summer}} months, these records started to sweat and decompose. In 1889, Aylsworth developed an aluminum wax, using acetate of alumina and stearic acid with sodium hydroxide added as a <b>saponifying</b> <b>agent.</b> It was found these records were much more durable. Problems arose, however, {{since there was no}} tempering agent and hot weather caused these records to decompose. Two problems contributed to this, stearic quality varied from different makers; Aylsworth purchased some from P&G and found it had too much olaic acid in it. The next cause {{of the problem is that}} all stearic acid without a tempering agent takes on moisture, and after many experiments it was found that Ceresine was ideal. To make the wax hard, sodium carbonate was added. Even so, a few batches of records still had some problems and became fogged. The fog problem arose from acetic acid left in the wax; this problem was solved when higher temperatures were used to make sure all the acetic acid was boiled out of the wax. As such, the records from 1889 to 1894 are a reddish-brown color due to the long cooking time. By 1896, Edison started using hydrated alumina in place of acetate of alumina. The use of hydrated alumina (sheet aluminum dissolved in a mixture of sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and distilled water) made better records, and the wax could be manufactured in a shorter period of time. Using the hydrated aluminum resulted in more desirable blanks, with fewer defects and shorter production time.|$|E
30|$|In many decellularisation {{protocols}} {{chelating agents}} such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) aid in cell dissociation from ECM proteins by sequestering metal ions. It {{is likely that}} chelating agents contribute to subtle disruptions in protein–protein interactions but they alone are insufficient for superficial cell removal even with agitation, and they are therefore typically used in combination with enzymes such as trypsin or detergents. It is generally preferred to follow a protocol which can retain the structural and functional component of the extracellular matrix. Non-ionic detergents have relatively mild effects upon tissue structure but disrupt lipid–lipid and lipid–protein interactions leaving protein–protein interactions intact. In this regard, {{we found out that}} using 0.3  % w/v of non-ionic detergent, which primarily involves the removal of fat and soluble proteins was optimum. Further, to solubilize the cytoplasmic component of the cells including nucleic acids, alkaline/acid treatment was performed and we found sodium peroxide at 0.3  % w/w was optimum as a <b>saponifying</b> and alkaline <b>agent.</b> The surfactant treatment will typically remove about 30  % to about 40  % and the alkaline treatment about 60  % to about 70  % of the non-collagenous protein ultimately. The alkaline treatment opens up the tertiary and secondary structure of collagen, which in turn facilitates easy removal of non-collagenous matter. In the last parameter of enzymatic aided processing, 10  h incubation with trypsin was found to be optimum.|$|R
