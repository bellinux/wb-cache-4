The boys' Aunt Gertrude becomes [...] "Trudy", their mother Laura is given {{a career as a}} librarian, and their father is semi-retired.

For example, the second book in the series, Running on Fumes, deals with environmentalists who go a little too far to try to save trees." [...] The Hardys are also featured in a new graphic novel series, begun in 2005 and produced by Papercutz, and a new early chapter book series called The Hardy Boys: Secret Files, begun in 2010 by the publisher Simon & Schuster under their Aladdin imprint. The last Undercover Brothers books were released in January 2012 (main series) and July 2012 (Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys Super Mystery'07 series).

40|$|The University of Toledo August 29, 1979 2801 W. Bancroft Street FROM: Marty Clark Toledo, Ohio 43606 FOR RELEASE UPON RECEIPT Office of Public Information (419) 537 · 2675 Dedication of the Wa. ~<!_!: 1 ~_CaE-~~~y, Center for Re~_~~rc::~_. ~~d Use of Rare Books and Special Collections of The University of Toledo's Carlson Library {{has been}} {{scheduled}} for 4 p. m. on Wednesday, Sept. 26, according to Leslie W. Sheridan, di­rector of libraries at the University. An open {{house will be}} held in the Center from 2 to 4 p. m. on Sept. 26 and The Friends of The University of Toledo Libraries will mark the occasion at its annual dinner meeting that evening. Journalist Bill Moyers will address the dinner, to be held at the Inverness Club, Mr. Sheridan said. Construction and equipping of the 13, 000 -square-foot Canaday Center was made possible by a gift of $ 226, 000 from Mrs. Doreen Canaday Spitzer in memory of her father, the Toledo industrialist for whom it is named. Located in a fully enclosed section of the fifth level of the Carlson Library, the Canaday Center includes a public display area for rare books and manuscripts furnished with 14 movable walnut display cases and special lighting. Also parts of the Center are a preservation area for storage of collections under conditions of controlled temperature and humidity, a large study area for scholars and researchers using the collection, a work area for Center staff, an office for the director, and a smaller office and work area for visiting scholars. The custom-fabricated display cases and special lighting in the public display area provide an unusually flexible environment for exhibiting materials from the Center's collections, Mr. Sheridan noted. The walnut cases feature self-contained, filtered lighting and movable glass shelves. They were designed to complement walnut tables, chairs, <b>shelving</b> and catalogue <b>cases</b> originally acquired when the University opened the first library on its main campus more than 40 years ago. These furnishings have been preserved and refinished for use in the Center. (over) The display cases are free-standing and may be placed in a variety of arrangements within the public display area depending on the needs of "each exhi­bition. A flexible system of lights, suspended from ceiling tracks, will permit materials to be shown in an interesting and dramatic way, he explained. Three university librarians experienced in the area of special collections have been invited to attend the dedication and will meet with Mr. Sheridan and other Uni­versity officials on Thursday, Sept. 27, to help develop a program for continued ac­quisitions by the Canaday Center and an outline of qualifications for a director for the Center. They are Dr. James Tanis, director of the Mariam Coffin Canaday Library at Bryn Mawr College (Bryn Mawr, Pa.), Dr. John C. Dann, director of the University of Michigan's Clements Libary, and Dean Keller, curator of special collections at the Kent State University Library (Kent, 0.). Mrs. Spitzer's mother, the late Mariam Canaday, was a benefactor of the Bryn Mawr Library. Mrs. Canaday and Mrs. Spitzer both were graduates of Bryn Mawr College. Mr. Sheridan said that the Canaday Center's collections already have developed areas of specialization in the materials of certain American writers. These include poets Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, novelists William Faulkner and Edith Wharton, women novelists from the American South including Katherine Anne Porter, Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor and Ellen Glasgow, and Black writers, particularly those who es­tablished reputations during the past 20 years. "In terms of the Center's collections, we are in an organizational phase and the advice and assistance of Drs. Tanis and Dann and Mr. Keller will be very welcome. We will be identifying areas in which the collections can be expanded to achieve maximum usefulness for scholars at reasonable cost, areas which do not duplicate collections already assembled by libraries in the Midwest," he explained. Dr. William McDonald, Jr. and Noel Stock, professors of English at UT, have served as consultants on acquisitions made by the Center to date. Mr. Sheridan said that he anticipates that an emphasis will be placed on acquiring (more) / special materials in the humanities in adding to the Center's collections, and that funds. are being sought from various sources outside the University to assist in that effort. Reservations for the annual dinner meeting of The Friends of The University of Toledo Libraries, to be addressed by Mr. Moyers, are welcome and may be obtained by calling Mr. Sheridan's office in the Carlson Library, 537 - 2326. The dinner will be open to the public as well as members of the Friends. - 30 ­...|$|R
