25|$|On 11 December 2001, {{as a part}} of New Zealand's {{contribution}} to Operation ENDURING FREEDOM, the NZSAS commenced Operation CONCORD. This deployment saw the NZSAS deploying a Squadron as a component of Task Force K-Bar to perform operations as part of the War on Terrorism in Afghanistan. The Squadron performed a variety of missions including special reconnaissance, direct action, close personal protection and <b>sensitive</b> <b>site</b> exploitation. Initially special reconnaissance patrols were performed on foot with insertion and extraction being conducted by helicopter in the high-altitude snow-covered areas of southern and central Afghanistan. Three NZSAS patrols were involved in this manner during Operation ANACONDA in March 2002. In May 2002 the focus changed to mounted operations with patrols using modified American Humvees, supported by motorbikes to conduct 'long-range extended-duration patrols'. These patrols would often last 20 to 30 days and cover between 1000 and 2000 kilometres. Three six month 'roulements' of between 40 and 65 soldiers from the NZSAS served in Afghanistan during this time, before the unit returned to New Zealand on 12 December 2002.|$|E
500|$|There {{were several}} {{challenges}} {{in building the}} Vine Street Expressway between 18th Street and the Ben Franklin Bridge. The road was to run through developed areas of Philadelphia, intersecting several streets and railroad lines. In addition, the route was to run through Franklin Square, a historically <b>sensitive</b> <b>site,</b> to connect to the Ben Franklin Bridge. As a result, the routing was modified in 1966 to avoid many of these obstacles. The route was to avoid running through Franklin Square, leading to the eastbound direction using surface streets to access the Ben Franklin Bridge, and a planned connector to Market Street was removed. In the 1970s, the proposed freeway’s environmental impact statement had to be evaluated again per new guidelines; when the new environmental impact statement was issued in 1977, {{it was found that}} more improvements were needed for mass transit {{in the area of the}} planned freeway. To comply with this, provisions were made concerning the proposed underground Center City Commuter Connection for SEPTA Regional Rail, in which the railroad tracks would pass under I-676 and residences would be built over the railroad tunnel in Chinatown. Construction was approved in 1986 on the Vine Street Expressway from 18th Street to the Ben Franklin Bridge, with no provisions for elevated connections between the Ben Franklin Bridge and the Vine Street Expressway to avoid disturbing Franklin Square. [...] This portion of the Vine Street Expressway opened to traffic on January 10, 1991, completing I-676.|$|E

2500|$|Christian's colossal {{work load}} {{required}} {{enormous amounts of}} energy to match it and despite having some bouts of serious illness as he got older the architect continued {{to meet the demands}} of his large practice. Typical of this is his appointment in 1887 as Consulting Architect to the Charity Commissioners for whom he produced a great report on the City of London churches which was said to be 'the most complete account [...] ever written'. Christian personally inspected the 54 churches, strenuous and sometimes dangerous work, undertaken when he was over 70 years old. Christian carried out restoration work on several of these churches, a notably restrained and respectful one being that of 1892–95 to Sir Christopher Wren's St Martin Ludgate on Ludgate Hill. This contrasts with his rather insensitive restoration work of 1851 and 1866 to Nicholas Hawksmoor's Christ Church, Spitalfields in east London where he drastically removed the old galleries and box pews and made alterations to the original windows. The architect's personal survey of the old unstable tower of Chichester Cathedral in 1861 could have resulted in his death as it collapsed in a gale the day after he had climbed it.} Adding to his burdens, Christian also acted as an assessor and judge in important architectural competitions throughout the country, though not always satisfactorily. In that for an Anglican Cathedral in Liverpool (1884–86) his choice of Sir William Emerson's odd design of mixed styles for the building, which was to be built on a <b>sensitive</b> <b>site</b> close to St George's Hall, caused a controversy within the RIBA which was aired publicly in the press. The chosen design was not built and the present cathedral by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott (1880–1960), begun in 1903 on a different site, stemmed from a later competition. Christian's report on the competition for St Mary's Episcopal Cathedral, Edinburgh (1872) was thought to be 'a model of its kind' though the donors chose the design by Sir George Gilbert Scott (1811–78) before seeing Christian's report which favoured George Edmund Street's design. The competition for a new Admiralty and War Office building in Whitehall, London, in 1884 involved Christian in a selection committee as President of the RIBA. The committee were faced with a difficult two-stage process with 128 entries to assess. Despite their arduous and careful work the committee experienced much hostility towards their choices and, having made the final selection, parliamentary economic concerns led to the collapse of the scheme (two separate buildings were later constructed), thus wasting the time and effort of Christian and his colleagues.|$|E

40|$|The first {{simultaneous}} microbeam {{mapping of}} {{single event upset}} (SEU) and latchup (SEL) in the CMOS RAM HM 65162 is presented. We found that {{the shapes of the}} sensitive areas depend on VDD, on the ions being used and on the site on the chip being hit by the ion. In particular, we found SEL <b>sensitive</b> <b>sites</b> close to the main power supply lines between the memory-bit-arrays by detecting the accompanying current surge. All these SELs were also accompanied by bit-flips elsewhere in the memory (which we call 'indirect' SEUs in contrast to the well known SEUs induced in the hit memory cell only). When identical SEL <b>sensitive</b> <b>sites</b> were hit farther away form the supply lines only indirect SEL <b>sensitive</b> <b>sites</b> could be detected. We interpret these events as 'latent' latchups in contrast to the 'classical' ones detected by their induced current surge. These latent SELs were probably decoupled from the main supply lines by the high resistivity of the local supply lines...|$|R
