Although he managed 17 seasons in Detroit and just 9 seasons in Cincinnati, his Hall of Fame plaque has him wearing a Cincinnati Reds uniform. He chose to wear the Reds cap at his {{induction}} in honor of former GM Bob Howsam, who gave Anderson his first chance at a major-league managing job. Before his induction, Anderson had refused to go inside the Hall because he felt unworthy, saying [...] "I didn't ever want to go into the most precious place in the world unless I belonged." [...] In his acceptance speech he gave a lot of credit to his players, saying there were two kinds of managers, [...] "One, it ain't very smart. He gets bad players, loses games and gets fired. There was <b>somebody</b> <b>like</b> me <b>that</b> was a genius. I got good players, stayed out of the way, let 'em win a lot, and then just hung around for 26 years." [...] He was very proud of his Hall induction, [...] "I never wore a World Series ring ... I will wear this ring until I die." ...|$|R

He {{had to make the}} dialogue give character to a person and progress the story, and that's practically what Ford as a director did all the time. Ford cut through the nuance and all that crap and got down to the basic story. He put the nuance in with the camera. Jimmy was a writer of the same type... I knew Jimmy Grant for twenty years.

5000|$|The term self-schema {{describes}} a mental process to aim in understanding and organizing incoming information (stimuli). An example would include looking in your rearview mirror while driving and seeing flashing lights - typically {{an individual has}} an automatic response and prepares to pull over with out having to think. This illustrates a well-organized schema on [...] "flashing lights". The connection between self-schema and spiritual self-schema therapy {{is shown in the}} automatic beliefs about oneself. An individual doesn't have to stop and think [...] "Who am I? How would <b>somebody</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> respond to this situation?" [...] If an individual is shy and believes they are ugly, they may see somebody looking in their direction and assume the person is staring at how ugly they are, when in reality they could be finding the person quite attractive or even not looking at them at all.|$|E
5000|$|Writer/artist Bob Layton {{said of the}} story: [...] "I'm gonna quote David Michelinie here, that it {{was never}} our {{intention}} to do anything relevant. We were paid to, basically, do the next episode of Iron Man. It's just in that particular issue, alcoholism was the bad guy. Instead of Doctor Doom or <b>somebody</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> it was the bottle. That was our villain of the month. And that's really the way we treated it. We built everything up to that. But {{the point of it}} is, it was never... we never attempted to be relevant. It just... in the corporate world, what gets to guys? What causes the downfall? Usually it's greed, or it's sex and drugs, right? Well, we couldn't do the sex part, right? Alcohol wasn't talked about all that much, really, to be honest with you. Especially with kids, you know, in that particular era. But, you know, we treated it as we intended to, as the bad guy." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{video is}} said to be loosely based on how the duo met. It takes place in Amy's apartment, with her {{thinking}} back to the night before. Group member Nick Noonan describes it as [...] "She ran into a guy, who is me. She got along really well, didn’t expect to get along with <b>somebody</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> then {{at the end of the}} night they exchanged numbers. The whole song is ‘Why didn’t you call me? Don’t leave me brokenhearted.’ She’s never really felt like this, she’s confused, she’s anxious. You think this guy might be a jerk, but then at the very end you figure out why he didn’t call." [...] The 'cheerio' part in the song came about when Claude Kelly wanted to add a little personality to the song: he asked Amy, what would she say if she was pacing around her apartment waiting for a guy to call you, she said 'Cheerio' and [...] "it just stuck!" ...|$|E

5000|$|The whole {{film was}} shot in F2 in order to {{accommodate}} Rooney Mara. Bradley Young later said [...] "I hadn't shot actresses of her caliber before. But she was down. And I felt lucky that I could expose <b>somebody</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> It's like what Harris Savides did with Nicole Kidman on Birth. Everyone {{thought it would be a}} disaster, but those are some of the best images ever of Kidman. And he cooked the negative way more than we did:—Bradley Young [...] The film was shot on 35mm film using the ARRICAM LT and Panavision XL. Most of the film was shot on Cooke S4 lenses and Low Con 1 and Low Con 2 filters in order to achieve the desired look. Cinematographer Bradley Young said he wanted to witness to the film's form take shape instead of having to make it look a certain way in post-production, and felt 35mm allowed him to add the energy of the film into the negative directly. The film does not give a time period for its setting, but reviewers have described it as seemingly dating to the 1960s or 70s.|$|E
5000|$|El Águila was {{introduced}} as a recurring adversary of Power Man and Iron Fist. Power Man and Iron Fist writer Mary Jo Duffy recounted his creation: [...] El Aguila {{was designed by}} Dave Cockrum and he had this big Zorro thing, and Zorro was another one of these characters that I was just crazy about and Power Man and Iron Fist was tricky. These were not guys who could fly. Their superpowers were defensive {{and if they were}} offensive, {{it was going to be}} hands-on, and it’s remarkably tricky inventing a villain for <b>somebody</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> ... It seemed to me that someone like Zorro but with one or two powers would be about the right level and since Iron Fist was a little bit easygoing and unworldly, and Power Man was just so cranky and completely grounded in the here and now, giving him somebody with this playful panache would be frustrating. Iron Fist wouldn’t even get it, Power Man would be infuriated by it, and it would give El Aguila a certain amount of charm. So I wasn’t just thinking of the power problem, though it was a problem, but in terms of the characters—it had to interest me. And Power Man and Iron Fist were so well-realized as characters that if a villain wasn’t as equally well-realized, then what was the point in doing it? ...|$|E
40|$|I {{have spent}} the last few years of my life {{presenting}} papers on the ways in which cognitive science in general and linguistics in particular can inform research in Information Systems (IS). The works originate firmly in the “Chomskian ” 1 tradition of linguistics, contrary to the general theme of the workshop. But do we really need to take sides in the generative vs. cognitive linguistics debate? I suggest that even though one might prefer a view on theoretical grounds, both camps have valuable contributions to some areas of IS. To begin with, we note that {{there appears to be a}} mistaken assumption that, by subscribing to a Chomskian framework, one also subscribes to the notion that “formal semantics ” to do with quantification, negation and so on, is the only possible kind of semantics. That is, semantics as a cognitive fact is supposed not to exist. This is simply not true. Chomsky himself remarks “ [...] . if semantics is what is meant by the tradition (say, Peirce or Frege or <b>somebody</b> <b>like</b> <b>that),</b> that is, if semantics is the relation between sound and thing, it may not exist ” [1] p. 73.
