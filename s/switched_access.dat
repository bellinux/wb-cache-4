40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} an HTTP based approach for handover {{within and between}} heterogeneous communication systems. Therefore a Split-Proxy-Concept has been developed, consisting of client- and server side proxies. Communication between proxies takes place using TCP connections, thus benefiting from existing IP mobility approaches and virtual serial connections as provided by Bluetooth or circuit <b>switched</b> <b>access.</b> The latter allows to forgo a full TCP/IP stack allowing very light-weight implementations on resource limited client devices such as smart phones. Furthermore, the protocol allows payload data caching and retransmission in case of gaps of network coverage.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of INTERNET and high speed ATM networks, people {{pay much attention}} on packet <b>switched</b> <b>access</b> when setting up a wireless local area network. Information sources of diverse rate such as video, text, voice, fax, E-mail are packetized in order to flow through the packet switched networks. Traditional circuit <b>switched</b> <b>access</b> does not performance efficiently for bursty packet traffic nature. As a result, a packet-based wireless Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol that can support information of diverse rate is essential for a wireless LAN. Packet Reservation Multiple Access (PRMA) is a potential candidate for the a 3 rd generation wireless LAN that support multimedia information. The user capacity of a PRMA LAN is high because it can take the advantage of statistical multiplexing gain from bursty packet traffic. However, the potential of conventional PRMA is not fully released. We propose methods of improving the performance (e. g. packet delay, packet drops, user capacity) of PRMA under various traffic conditions. Since data traffic is becoming as important as voice traffic, we analyze a PRMA data LAN with our proposed mathematical model. We also use computer simulations to study {{the performance of a}} PRMA data LAN. As it is getting common that voice and data traffic co-exist in the same wireless LAN, we propose a new voice/data PRMA protocol, which use dynamic transmission probability and gives speech users a higher priority and data users reservation, can improve both the performance of data and voice traffic. Computer simulations have proven that our proposed protocol can introduce data users into the LAN without disturbing the performance of speech users very much. Our PRMA implementation proposals perform better than conventional PRMA in many ways...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A fully packet <b>switched</b> <b>access</b> network such as 3 G LTE imposes new {{challenges}} for real time voice services. Packet drop, delay variation, and random channel fading calls for variations of scheduling technique {{to address the}} challenging technical difficulties arising due to the migration from circuit switched domain. A new challenge of starvation comes due to provisioning different services with different delay requirements. This paper proposes a new semi-persistent scheme of MAC scheduling to adaptively prioritize VoIP traffic by not forcing other traffics to starve. The proposed scheme, which combines VoIP priority mode with user coupling, allows to utilize the system capacity efficiently. Simulation shows that the scheme performs better than the original persistent scheduling as well as absolute VoIP priority mode.

US regulators and courts have used network and service provider interconnection {{as a tool}} to actively encourage the development of competition in the telecommunications sector.

40|$|A cap on {{the price}} of interstate access service was {{implemented}} by the Federal Communications Commission in 1991 to provide local exchange carriers (LECs) with an incentive to improve their productive efficiency. A question has arisen as to whether a deterioration in service quality for interstate access service has been an unintended consequence of this {{cap on the}} price. The analysis in this article uses several different measures of service quality, including the average installation interval, the percentage of commitments met, total trouble reports, and the average repair interval for both <b>switched</b> <b>access</b> service and special access service, to investigate empirically whether there has been a decline in service quality between 1991 and 2000. The results are conclusive. Overall, service quality has fallen. To rectify the situation, a proposal is offered to adjust the price cap index to penalize LECs who fail to provide an acceptable level of aggregate service quality. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{variety of}} new {{register}} file architectures {{have been developed for}} embedded processors in recent years, promoting hardware design to achieve low-power dissipation and reduced die size over traditional unified register file structures. This paper presents a novel register allocation scheme for a clustered VLIW DSP processor which is designed with distinctively banked register files in which port access is highly restricted. With the specific register file organizations considered to decrease the power consumption because of fewer port connections, not only does the clustered design make register access across clusters an additional issue, but the <b>switched</b> <b>access</b> nature of the register file demands further investigations into optimizing register assignment for increasing instruction level parallelism. We propose a heuristic algorithm to obtain preferable register allocation that is expected to well utilize the irregular register file architectures.

40|$|Abstract In the parlance of {{regulatory}} economics, “pass through ” {{refers to the}} effect of a change in an incremental cost – generally, the effect of a change in a regulated input price – on the retail price of a good or service. In this paper we examine pass through with regard to the <b>switched</b> <b>access</b> fees paid by long distance companies to local exchange carriers in the United States. We estimate the degree to which long distance companies pass through differences in access rates to their customers, and we examine whether mandates imposed by regulators on long distance companies to pass through access fee reductions to customers affect the extent of pass through. We evaluate annual panel data on intrastate long-distance revenues, access expenses, and minutes of use from 2004 to 2008 in each of the 50 states in the U. S. using a proprietary and detailed data set. We leverage the fact that some states have accompanied access rate reductions with pass through mandates, and others have not. Using standard multivariate regression techniques our results are consistent with 100 % pass through of access rate reductions in states that have undergone regulatory access reform. We also find that a regulatory mandate on long distance companies to pass through access rate reductions has no statistically significant effect on the magnitude of access fee pass through, supporting the economic hypothesis that pas...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the transmission of}} video over third generation radio access networks. The {{first part of the}} thesis investigates the capabilities of Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Networks (UTRAN) in terms of the provision of multimedia communications. The error performance and traffic requirements of real-time video transmission over circuit switched and packet switched connections are examined. The effect of network parameter settings upon video performances is evaluated, and optimum radio bearer configurations for the transmission of video are derived. A method of estimating received video quality after transmission over error prone environments is developed. The quality estimation is based on a distortion model, which accurately models the overall distortion seen in decoder frame reconstruction. This includes quantisation distortion, concealment distortion, and error propagation. Based on the developed performance model, optimum MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit) size for efficient wireless video communications over a packet <b>switched</b> <b>access</b> network is derived. The second part of the thesis investigates quality enhancement techniques for multimedia traffic transmitted over wireless channels. Quality enhancement is achieved at three levels of the transmission process: link level, application level and system level. Link level quality enhancement techniques are designed to optimise the allocation of link level parameter values according to the media characteristics. A novel Unequal Error Protection scheme and a novel Unequal Power Allocation scheme are designed to exploit the inherent diversity in the subjective importance of different sections of compressed media. The algorithms are developed and analysed for transmission of video over 3 G wireless systems. The effectiveness of these algorithms is demonstrated through the results of simulated transmission over a UMTS channel. Application level quality enhancement techniques are designed to explore the time-varying nature of the wireless channel. A number of link adaptation schemes are proposed for real time video communication and real-time video streaming over 3 G wireless systems. These algorithms are designed to enhance the perceptual video quality, and the system utilisation. This is achieved by adapting the allocated radio network parameters and the source parameters, according to a feedback channel condition. Simulation results show a significant performance improvement compared to non-adaptive schemes. Finally, system level adaptation techniques are designed for efficient radio resource allocation in multi-user scenarios. Two adaptive resource allocation schemes are proposed and analysed for real-time video communications in a UMTS system. The proposed algorithms are shown to provide improved performances in terms of average received video quality and user satisfaction. Key words: Wireless Communication, Multimedia communication.
