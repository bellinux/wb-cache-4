5|$|Although the {{bay bolete}} is {{predominantly}} a mycorrhizal species, {{it does have}} some saprophytic tendencies and {{may be able to}} use this lifestyle in certain circumstances. The ectomycorrhizae formed between I.badia and spruce (Picea abies) have active hyphal sheaths and a higher potential to store nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc than other mycorrhizal types, indicating the fungus is well adapted to acidic <b>stands</b> <b>and</b> its mycorrhizae are very efficient in uptake and storage of macronutrients. Mycorrhizae with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) have also been described.|$|E

5|$|As the {{popularity}} of waterparks increased, the H20hhh Zone was added in 1985. In 1989, the park expanded across the Loyalhanna Creek by adding a trolley ride based on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, a popular children's television show. The ride was designed and voiced by children's entertainer Fred Rogers, a native of Latrobe. The area was expanded the following year to include Raccoon Lagoon, an area for children. A Ferris wheel, Tilt-A-Whirl and a water raft ride were added {{by the end of}} the 1980s, along with games, new food <b>stands</b> <b>and</b> restaurants.|$|E

30|$|The dataset used in {{this study}} was unique as LiDAR {{measurements}} were taken under uniform flying conditions and predominantly from a single tree species that occurred across a very diverse set of <b>stand</b> <b>and</b> site conditions. The relative control of LiDAR attributes and tree species within this dataset allowed the impact of <b>stand</b> structure <b>and</b> site conditions on GRper to be accurately assessed. Response functions between GRper and independent variables were well defined as variation in <b>stand</b> <b>and</b> site conditions were extremely wide. Findings show that a relatively large proportion of the variation in GRper could be attributed to stand conditions (age, <b>stand</b> <b>and</b> understory structure) with the site conditions (stand slope) accounting for somewhat less of the variance.|$|R
