5000|$|In futures trading, a {{box spread}} is a spread {{constructed}} from two consecutive <b>butterfly</b> <b>spreads</b> (also {{known as a}} [...] "double butterfly"), summing to +1 -3 +3 -1 in consecutive, or at least equally spaced, contracts. The term also has an alternative meaning {{within the context of}} inter-commodity spreads whereby it refers to either an inter-commodity spread within one month offset by the same inter-commodity spread but in another month (or alternatively a calendar spread for each respective instrument). Often presumed not to move much (as in theory they are practically non directional) they typically, but not always, trade in a range. The box <b>spread,</b> like normal <b>butterfly</b> and calendar <b>spreads,</b> derives it's hedging construction from characteristics of Pascal's Triangle.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin {{finite element}} (dGFEM) method for variable coefficient diffusion-convection-reaction equation to discretize the Heston PDE for the numerical pricing of European options. The mixed derivatives {{in the cross}} diffusion term are handled in a natural way compared to the finite difference methods. The advantages of dGFEM space discretization and Crank-Nicolson method with Rannacher smoothing as time integrator for Heston model with non-smooth initial and boundary conditions are illustrated in several numerical examples for European call, <b>butterfly</b> <b>spread</b> and digital options. The convection dominated Heston PDE for vanishing volatility is efficiently solved utilizing the adaptive dGFEM algorithm.

40|$|Abstract—In Grid environments, where virtual {{organization}} resources are allocated to users using mechanisms analogue to market economies, strong price fluctuations {{can have an}} impact on the nontrivial quality-of-service expected by end users. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the use of option contracts on the quality of service offered by a broker-based Grid resource allocation model. Option contracts offer users the possibility to buy or sell Grid resources in the future for a strike price specified in a contract. By buying, borrowing and selling option contracts using a hedge strategy users can benefit from expected price changes. In this paper, we consider three hedge strategies: the <b>butterfly</b> <b>spread</b> which profits from small changes, the straddle which benefits from large price changes, and the call strategy which benefits from soaring prices. Using our model based on an abstract Grid architecture, we find that the use of hedge strategies augment the ratio of successfully finished jobs to failed jobs. We show that the degree of successfulness from hedge strategies changes when the number of contributed resources changes. By means of a model, we also show that the effects of the <b>butterfly</b> <b>spread</b> is mainly explained by the amount of contributed resources. The dynamics of the two other hedge strategies are best explained by observing the price behavior. We also find that by using hedge strategies the users can increase the probability that a job will finish before the deadline. We conclude that hedging using options is a promising approach to improve resource allocation in environments where resources are allocated by using a commodity market mechanism.

These evolution functions are the forward local variance rate and a new concept called the forward local default arrival rate. We then specialize to the case where the only jump which can occur reduces the underlying stock price by a fixed fraction of its pre-jump value. This is a standard assumption when valuing an option written on a stock which can default. We discuss novel strategies for calibrating to a term and strike structure of European options prices. In particular using a few calendar dates, we derive closed form expressions for both the local variance and the local default arrival rate.

Credit spreads on tranches in a transaction are inversely related to the number of tranches. The average price for transferring a unit of expected default risk, paid in a transaction, is inversely related to the default probability of the underlying asset pool. The average price, paid for a tranche, increases with the rating of the tranche, it is higher for the lowest rated tranche and very high for AAA-tranches in true sale-transactions. It varies little across <b>butterfly</b> <b>spreads</b> obtained from rated tranches except for the most senior spread.
