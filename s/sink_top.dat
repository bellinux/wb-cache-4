The as-built heterojunction has potential application in optoelectronic devices, {{because it may}} combine the emission from the rare-earth-doped transparent oxide, with a high mobility semiconductor. Trivalent rare-earth-doped SnO 2 presents very efficient emission in a wide wavelength range, including red (in the case of Eu 3 +) or blue (Ce 3 +). The advantage of this structure {{is the possibility of}} separation of the rare-earth emission centers, from the electron scattering, leading to an indicated combination for electroluminescence. Electrical characterization of the heterojunction SnO 2 :Eu/GaAs shows a significant conductivity increase when compared to the conductivity of the individual films. Monochromatic light excitation shows up the role of the most external layer, which may act as a shield (top GaAs), or an ultraviolet light absorber <b>sink</b> (<b>top</b> RE-doped SnO 2). The observed improvement on the electrical transport properties is probably related to the formation of short conduction channels in the semiconductors junction with two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) behavior, which are evaluated by excitation with distinct monochromatic light sources, where the samples are deposited by varying the order of layer deposition...|$|E

At moderately weak electric fields, our model predicts a different effect, stating that the DNA length dependence of the capture rate first disappears as the field is reduced and eventually reverses to a decreasing trend with $N$.

The underground stream next appears in Kingsdale Master Cave, and it resurges at Keld Head 2.7 km down the valley. The Main Chamber is several hundred thousand years old, and was formed by solution under phreatic conditions before the Kingsdale valley had formed and allowed it to drain. The square profile of the chamber has resulted from rock collapses from joints.

40|$|The {{transient}} temperature of {{solid state power}} switches is investigated using thermal resistance network modelling and experimental testing. The ability of a heat sink mounted {{to the top of}} the device to reduce the {{transient temperature}} is assessed. Transient temperatures for heat pulses of up to 100 ms are of most interest. The transient temperature distribution inside a typical stack-up of a solid state power switch is characterised. The thermal effects of adding a heat <b>sink</b> to the <b>top</b> of the device are then assessed. A variety of heat sink thicknesses and materials are evaluated. Components of the device stack-up are varied in order to assess their affect on the effectiveness of the heat sink in reducing the device temperature.

This modelling technique allowed a good understanding of the thermal behaviour inside the stack-up and heat sink during the transient period. The concept of using a heat sink to suppress the transient temperature was validated experimentally on two types of solid state power switch.

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) {{consists}} {{of a large number}} of sensor nodes which are densely deployed. The clusters are formed based on the overlapping degree and residual energy of sensor and then hierarchical backbone is constructed with <b>sink</b> at the <b>top.</b> Flow Balanced Routing (FBR) overcomes the problem of imbalance in the energy consumption of Cluster Head(CH) nodes by sending the data in multiple paths, thereby increasing the network lifetime. If the data is sent in a single path to the sink, then the energy of the CH nodes will exhaust in that path. To avoid this, the data is sent in multiple path, by which the energy consumption of all the CH node are balanced. This approach enhances the lifespan of CH nodes, thereby increasing the network lifetime but it increases the delay and decrease the throughput. Since the CH’s at higher level have large amount of data than CH’s at lower level, the wake-up time of CH’s at higher level is set to be higher than the CH’s at lower level, which decrease the delay and also increases the network lifetime.

We performed an experimental mesocosm study where effects of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on two different pelagic food webs were investigated, one having zooplankton as highest trophic level {{and the other with}} planktivorous ﬁsh as top consumer.

The zooplankton production increased due to efﬁcient channeling of energy via both the bacteria land the phytoplankton pathway, while the ﬁsh production decreased due to channeling of energy mainly via the longer and less efﬁcient bacterial pathway.
