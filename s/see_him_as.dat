5|$|Although about 300 French knights {{accompanied}} {{him to the}} Holy Land, no influential noblemen joined him; they preferred participating in the French Albigensian Crusade or did not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> sufficiently eminent. John's cousin, Walter of Montbéliard, joined him only after he was expelled from Cyprus. Montbéliard led a naval expedition to Egypt to plunder the Nile Delta. After most of the French crusaders left the Holy Land, John forged a new truce with Al-Adil {{by the middle of}} 1211 and sent envoys to Pope Innocent urging him to preach a new crusade.|$|E

5|$|Applewhite {{began to}} {{emphasize}} a strict hierarchy, teaching that his students needed his guidance, as {{he needed the}} guidance of the Next Level. Zeller notes that this naturally ensured {{that there would be no}} possibility of the group's continuing if Applewhite were to die. A relationship with Applewhite was said to be the only way to salvation; he encouraged his followers to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> Christ. Zeller states that the group's previous focus on individual choice was replaced with an emphasis on Applewhite's role as a mediator. Applewhite maintained some aspects of their scientific teachings, but, in the 1980s, the group became more like a religion in its focus on faith and submission to authority.|$|E
5|$|Deven {{approached}} Vadivelu in October 2005 {{and offered}} him the lead roles. Vadivelu was initially hesitant {{to accept the}} offer as {{he felt that the}} audience would not want to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> the central character, but after Vadivelu read the script, he decided to take up the role. Regarding the selection of Vadivelu for the roles, Deven noted that one of the royal characters from his comic book strip in Ananda Vikatan closely resembled Vadivelu, including his complexion and nativity.|$|E
5|$|Late 18th-century critics {{felt that}} Smart's madness {{justified}} them in ignoring his A Song to David, {{but during the}} following century Robert Browning and his contemporaries considered his condition {{to be the source}} of his genius. It was not until the 20th century, with the rediscovery of Jubilate Agno (not published until 1939), that critics reconsidered Smart's case and began to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a revolutionary poet, the possible target of a plot by his father-in-law, a publisher, to silence him.|$|E

5|$|Miyazaki's biggest {{addition}} to {{the plot of the}} book was the use of the war as {{a large part of the}} plot. In the book, the war is only tangentially referred to; the king orders Howl to find the king's missing brother Justin, because Justin's military skills are needed for a forthcoming war. Howl's frequent disappearances are because of his womanizing habits, which makes Sophie <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a superficial and cowardly person. In the film, however, Howl disappears from the scene in order to transform into a giant bird and disrupt the battle plans of both armies.|$|E
5|$|The Polish Communist Party {{immediately}} attacked Piłsudski as {{a fascist}} and capitalist, though fascists themselves did not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> one of them. Other {{opponents of the}} Sanation regime, however, were more civil; socialists (such as Ignacy Daszyński and Tomasz Arciszewski) and Christian Democrats (represented by Ignacy Paderewski, Stanisław Wojciechowski and Władysław Grabski) expressed condolences. The peasant parties split in their reactions (Wincenty Witos voicing criticism of Piłsudski, but Maciej Rataj and Stanisław Thugutt being supportive), while Roman Dmowski's National Democrats expressed a toned-down criticism.|$|E
5|$|Vytautas became duke of Hrodna and Podlaskie; Jogaila known now by his Christian name Władysław II (Władysław II Jagiełło) {{designated}} {{his brother}} Skirgaila regent in Lithuania. Skirgaila, who also ruled Vytautas' patrimony in Trakai, was disliked by the Lithuanian nobility. Vytautas, {{on the other}} hand, became increasingly popular; Władysław II began to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a rival. Vytautas was supported by Lithuanians who resented the Polish interpretation of the recent Union of Krewo. These Lithuanians wished to maintain distinct legal structures and reserve official posts for Lithuanians. The Lithuanian elites also resented the changes in government that king Władysław II implemented there.|$|E

5|$|Bure {{held out}} {{well into the}} 1998–99 season until he was traded on January 17, 1999, to the Florida Panthers, with Bret Hedican, Brad Ference, and Vancouver's third-round choice in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft (Robert Fried) for Ed Jovanovski, Dave Gagner, Mike Brown, Kevin Weekes, and Florida's first-round choice in the 2000 draft (Nathan Smith). Talks between Burke and Bryan Murray, {{general manager of the}} Panthers, had begun in late-December. After the trade was completed, Bure {{explained}} that he felt alienated from Canucks' management after arriving in North America having defected from Russia. He claimed he had been in Los Angeles for two weeks before any Canucks' representative came to <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> well as several bitter contract negotiationsparticularly those of 1994. He also claimed that someone within the Canucks' management planted the constant allegations that he threatened not to play during the 1994 playoff run. Bure's agent at the time, Ron Salcer, also believed the story.|$|E
5|$|Following the Belmont, he was {{returned}} to Churchill Downs to rest, beginning to jog on the track the following Friday. On June 13, {{the day of the}} Stephen Foster Handicap, American Pharoah was paraded on the track between races. A crowd of 30,000 people showed up to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> he was hand-walked for about 45 minutes in front of the grandstand and in the paddock. Zayat, Baffert and Espinoza were also given their permanent keepsake Kentucky Derby and Triple Crown trophies in a ceremony that evening. American Pharoah's popularity was so high that his win made the cover of Sports Illustrated, he was photographed for Vogue, and during the NBA Playoffs, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, Steve Kerr, suggested that American Pharoah was the only athlete better than LeBron James.|$|E
5|$|On December9, 1964, Clarence13X {{was shot}} {{twice in the}} torso while at a popular {{gathering}} place {{in the basement of}} a Harlem tenement. He was brought to Harlem Hospital, where he was treated and released. He later claimed that he died and returned to his body a short time later. In a 2007 study of the Five Percent movement, American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight speculates that this caused his followers to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a Christ figure. The identity and motivation of the shooter are unknown; Knight notes that law enforcement and rival Muslim groups both had a motive to attack Clarence13X. Some Five Percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts. Clarence13X's companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence. While recuperating from his wounds, Clarence13X sought to distinguish his movement from other Islamic movements, abandoning Arabic greetings for English expressions.|$|E

5|$|Susan is {{identified}} as Mike's bride in the sixth season premiere. Her marriage to Mike destroys her friendship with Katherine. After the wedding, Julie is strangled outside of Susan's home. Julie slips into a coma following her attack. While {{waiting for her to}} awaken, Susan learns that Julie had dropped out of medical school, was involved with a married man, and had a pregnancy scare before her attack. When Julie awakens, she refuses to identify the married man she was seeing. Later in the season, Julie's attacker is revealed to be Eddie Orlofsky (Josh Zuckerman), a local young adult who is also responsible for a handful of murders in Fairview. Prior to the attack, Susan had taken Eddie on as an art student and he developed a crush on her. When he discovered that she was remarrying Mike and that she did not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a romantic suitor, he attacked Julie, mistaking her for Susan.|$|E
5|$|Following the United States' {{entry into}} the Second World War, Cameron {{signed up for the}} Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service, a part of the United States Navy, in February 1943. Initially sent to a {{training}} camp at Iowa State Teachers College in Cedar Falls, she was subsequently posted to Washington D.C., where she served as a cartographer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In the course of these duties, she met U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill in May 1943. She was reassigned to the Naval Photographic Unit in Anacostia, where she worked as a wardrobe mistress for propaganda documentaries, and during this period met various Hollywood stars. When her brother James returned to the U.S. injured from service overseas, she went AWOL and returned to Iowa to <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> a result of which she was court–martialed and confined to barracks {{for the rest of the}} war. For reasons unknown to her, she received an honorable discharge from the military in 1945. To join her family, she traveled to Pasadena, California, where her father and brothers had found work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).|$|E
5|$|However, Kerrigan {{does not}} perish, {{and as the}} second chapter begins, the player is charged by the Zerg hive mind, the Overmind, to protect a {{chrysalis}} it claims will be its greatest creation. The chrysalis eventually hatches on the Zerg world Char to reveal Kerrigan having been infested with Zerg DNA, making her a powerful hybrid of both Zerg and Terran genetics. Raynor, drawn to Char by psychic dreams cast by Kerrigan during her incubation, fails {{in an attempt to}} rescue her, but is spared as Kerrigan does not <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a threat, and possibly due to any lingering affection she had for him. After breaking into a Terran science vessel and reversing the neural conditioning from her training as a psionic agent, Kerrigan is able to sense the presence of the Protoss fleet commander Tassadar on Char. Tassadar diverts Kerrigan's attention long enough for his companion Zeratul to assassinate Zasz, one of the Zerg commanders, with psionic energies the Zerg are unfamiliar with. This causes a temporary mental link between Zeratul and the Overmind, who uses this momentary contact with Zeratul's memories to locate the Protoss homeworld Aiur. The Overmind immediately launches the bulk of the Zerg Swarm in an invasion, although Kerrigan remains behind on Char to hunt down Tassadar and Zeratul.|$|E

5|$|In late 1863, while Quantrill's Raiders {{spent the}} winter in Texas, {{animosity}} developed between Anderson and Quantrill. Anderson, perhaps falsely, implicated Quantrill in a murder, leading to the latter's arrest by Confederate authorities. Anderson subsequently returned to Missouri {{as the leader of}} a group of raiders and became the most feared guerrilla in the state, killing and robbing dozens of Union soldiers and civilian sympathizers throughout central Missouri. Although Union supporters viewed him as incorrigibly evil, Confederate sympathizers in Missouri saw his actions as justified, possibly owing to their mistreatment by Union forces. In September 1864 he led a raid on Centralia, Missouri. Unexpectedly, they were able to capture a passenger train, the first time Confederate guerrillas had done so. In {{what became known as the}} Centralia Massacre--possibly the war's deadliest and most brutal guerrilla action--his men killed 24 Union soldiers on the train and set an ambush later that day that killed more than 100 Union militiamen. A month later Anderson himself was killed in battle. Historians have made disparate appraisals of Anderson: some <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a sadistic, psychopathic killer, but for others his actions cannot be separated from the general lawlessness of the time.|$|E
5|$|Dinges {{wrote that}} in the early 1970s the U.S. Justice Department had enough {{evidence}} to bring an indictment of Noriega on drug charges in a U.S. court, but chose not to do so because of the diplomatic consequences involved. This evidence included the testimony of an arrested boat courier, and of a drug smuggler arrested in New York. Though Torrijos frequently promised the U.S. cooperation in dealing with drug smuggling, Noriega would have headed any effort at enforcement, and the U.S. began to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> the real problem. Dinges writes that the U.S. government considered several options to move Noriega out of the drug trafficking business, including assassinating him, and linking him to a fictional plot against Torrijos. Though no assassination attempt was made, the other ploys may have been tried in the early 1970s, according to Dinges. Beginning in 1972, however, Dinges writes that the U.S. relaxed its efforts at trapping individuals involved with smuggling within the Panama government, possibly {{as a result of an}} agreement between Torrijos and U.S. president Richard Nixon. Moreover, during the same period Noriega was becoming a trusted ally of the CIA, including acting as the U.S. emissary to Cuba during negotiations following the Johnny Express incident. Noriega, too, made an effort during this period to portray Panama as a hub of enforcement against drug smuggling, possibly as a result of pressure from Torrijos. Noriega's drug-related activities came to the U.S. government's attention once again during the ratification process for the Panama Canal treaties, but were once again downplayed by the U.S. intelligence services in order to get the treaty ratified by the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1915, an Indo-German {{expedition}} was sent to Afghanistan via the overland route through Persia. Led by the exiled Indian prince Raja Mahendra Pratap, this mission sought to invite the Afghan Emir Habibullah Khan to break with Britain, declare his independence, join the war on the Central side, and invade British India. It managed to evade the considerable Anglo-Russian efforts that were directed at intercepting it in Mesopotamia and in the Persian deserts before it reached Afghanistan in August 1915. In Afghanistan, it was joined in Kabul {{by members of the}} pan-Islamic group Darul Uloom Deoband led by Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi. This group had left India for Kabul {{at the beginning of the}} war while another group under Mahmud al-Hasan made its way to Hijaz, where they hoped to seek support from the Afghan Emir, the Ottoman Empire and Imperial Germany for a pan-Islamic insurrection beginning in the tribal belt of north-west India. The Indo-German mission pressed Emir Habibullah to break from his neutral stance and open diplomatic relations with Germany, eventually hoping to rally the Emir to the German war effort. Habibullah Khan vacillated on the mission's proposals through much of the winter of 1915, hoping to maintain his neutral stance till the course of the war offered a concrete picture. However, the mission opened at this time secret negotiations with the pro-German elements in the Emir's court and advisory council, including his brother Nasrullah Khan and son Amanullah Khan. It found support among Afghan intellectuals, religious leaders and the Afghan press which rallied with increasingly anti-British and pro-Central articles. By 1916 the Raj was forced to intercept copies of the Afghan newspaper Siraj al Akhbar sent to India. It raised to the Emir a threat of a coup d'état in his country and unrest among his tribesmen, who were beginning to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> subservient to British authority even as Turkey called for a pan-Islamic Jihad.|$|E
