500|$|In his psychoanalytical {{study of}} The Adventures of Tintin, the {{literary}} critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès expressed {{the view that}} The Red Sea Sharks reflected {{a world in which}} traditional values have been degraded and everything [...] including human life [...] has become a commodity. He added that Rastapopoulos becomes [...] "the embodiment of the global market" [...] in this story, tying together all of the other characters and therefore replacing Tintin as the figure [...] "at the centre of the universe". Apostolidès opined that The Red Sea Sharks amplifies [...] "the theme of the general equivalence of everything" [...] that is present in the series, serving as [...] "a kind of retrospective" [...] by introducing old characters and establishing new relationships between them. He believed that the theme of the mirage pervaded the story, appearing repeatedly in such forms as Abdullah's cuckoo clock which concealed a water <b>squirter</b> and the pseudonyms employed by the various characters throughout the narrative. The literary critic Tom McCarthy stated that The Red Sea Sharks exhibited a number of themes that recurred throughout The Adventures of Tintin. He believed that a scene in which one of Bab El Ehr's men spies on the Emir in his mountain hideaway reflected a wider theme of eavesdropping that features throughout the series. McCarthy also highlighted Tintin's actions in returning Abdullah to Khemed, expressing the view that {{it is part of a}} wider running theme throughout the series in which the hero takes an abandoned children to their home; other instances included Tintin's discovery of an adoptive family for the orphan Chang Chong-Chen in The Blue Lotus and the delivery of the lost gypsy child Miarka to her family in The Castafiore Emerald.|$|E
5000|$|A {{subset of}} the {{standard}} DTIs described above, is the [...] "squirter" [...] type DTI that contains {{a small amount of}} material in the cavity of each protrusion. [...] "Squirter" [...] type DTIs are mechanically and metallurgically identical to the standard DTIs described above, except that as the protrusions of <b>squirter</b> type DTIs collapse upon tightening, the cavity material is expelled to the outer diameter of the device, giving a visual indication of protrusion compression, i.e. bolt tension. [...] While not approved by the ASTM or specifically mentioned within the RCSC specification, <b>Squirter</b> type DTIs are allowable because the RCSC specification requires all structural DTIs to conform the ASTM F959 standard whose reference documentation includes the ASME B18.2.6 standard. Since ASME B18.2.6 section 5.1 permits the inclusion of features to facilitate silicone emitting DTIs, <b>squirter</b> type DTIs are permissible and can be installed and inspected per the RCSC specification.|$|E

50|$|The {{game has}} two main areas: the park, and the town. The park {{is where you}} will spend most of your time in. You water buds with your <b>squirter,</b> and they grow very quickly into either white flowers or colored flowers. If they are white, use your boom box to make them change color and spread seeds. The boom box does not work on colored flowers. To use your boom box, select it in your {{inventory}} next to white flowers. A wheel {{will appear on the}} screen when you select it. Spin the wheel at a moderate pace to play a catchy tune. Do not spin it too fast or too slow. At the end of each tune, there is a rating that scores your pace from 0-100. if you get a rating below 70, nothing will happen. If you get a rating 70 and up, your flower will change into a different color and will spread seeds to the surrounding area. If you grow 30 flowers in one area, the area will turn from fertile soil into green spaces. In green spaces, you cannot plant anymore flowers in the area, unless you lose a flower in that area. Plants cannot grow in sand.|$|E
5000|$|Kusi, {{pronounced}} /kusi/, means [...] "urine" [...] with {{a similar}} connotation as [...] "piss".

It is used by people in compound words, such as [...] "kusipää" [...] (pisshead, common translation of [...] "asshole"), as very offensive insults. Inoffensive synonyms are the clinical term virtsa ("urine") and the childish pissa ("pee"). The word pissa has drifted so far into everyday usage that in combined form pissapoika (pissing boy) it refers specifically to the <b>squirter</b> on the windshield of cars. Foreign visitors have been amused by the product [...] "Superpiss" [...] for windshield wiper fluid.
