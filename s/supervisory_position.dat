Promotion offers officers advancement into a <b>supervisory</b> <b>position.</b> Opportunities for advanced training are provided to members to enhance their growth after graduation from the police academy. Specialized training in firearms, defense tactics, and job-related topics such as basic criminal investigation are offered. Hash marks for service are being implemented to be worn on the left sleeve of the uniform as of 2015. One hash mark represents five years of service with the department. In July 2016, in an effort to streamline operations and give all divisions within the department an equal degree of priority, the sworn positions of Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel were eliminated, with all personnel holding the former ranks being appointed to the rank of Chief, a title formerly used only by certain civilian employees within the department.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{central theme}} of {{the paper is the}} {{question}} of whether graduates of business administration (BA) are better prepared for <b>supervisory</b> <b>positions</b> than non‐BA economics graduates and consequently have a greater chance of acquiring <b>supervisory</b> <b>positions</b> and, when they have such positions, earn more. In order to answer this question, we use a data‐set that relates to the labour market position of graduates from Dutch universities at the early stages of their careers. We find that BA graduates, despite their multidisciplinary education {{and the fact that they}} perceive fewer deficiencies in their education with respect to the ability for teamwork than non‐BA graduates, do not have a greater chance of acquiring <b>supervisory</b> <b>positions</b> than graduates from non‐BA economics courses. We also find that earnings in <b>supervisory</b> <b>positions</b> do not differ significantly between BA graduates and non‐BA graduates. The finding that most of the skills required for <b>supervisory</b> <b>positions</b> are acquired through work and not in education suggests that a combination of working and learning may be more effective for developing supervisory skills than a purely educational setting. Business administration, graduates, <b>supervisory</b> <b>positions,</b> required competences, job chances, earnings,...|$|R

2500|$|Over time, George {{begins a}} slow {{move up the}} {{corporate}} ladder, into a <b>supervisory</b> <b>position</b> in the department where he began. He has submitted recommendations on improving production in his department, which finally catch the attention of his uncle, who invites him to their home for a social event. At the party, George finally meets [...] "society girl" [...] Angela Vickers (Elizabeth Taylor), whom he has admired from afar since shortly after arriving in town, and they quickly fall in love. Being Angela's escort thrusts George into the intoxicating and care-free lifestyle of high society that his rich Eastman kin had denied him. When Alice announces that she is pregnant, and {{makes it clear that}} she expects George to marry her, he puts her off, spending more and more of his time with Angela and his new well-heeled friends. An attempt to procure an abortion for Alice fails, and she renews her insistence on marriage. George is invited to join Angela at the Vickers's holiday lake house over Labor Day, and excuses himself to Alice, saying that the visit will advance his career and accrue to the benefit of the coming child.|$|E
