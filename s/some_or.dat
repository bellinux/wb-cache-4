5|$|All eight {{lines of}} the Oslo Commuter Rail have <b>some</b> <b>or</b> all of their {{services}} operate through the tunnel, although many of these terminate at Skøyen. The Airport Express Train operates four hourly services through the tunnel and the Norwegian State Railways operate regional trains along the Vestfold Line and intercity trains along the Sørland Line and Bergen Line through the tunnel. Freight trains along the Sørland Line operate through the tunnel, although only at night, while freight trains along the Bergen Line do not, instead using the Roa–Hønefoss Line.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively {{pig iron}} {{may be made}} into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various {{processes}} {{have been used for}} this, including finery forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer converters, open hearth furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize <b>some</b> <b>or</b> all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where <b>some</b> (<b>or</b> most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E

5|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM), {{also known as}} female genital cutting and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of <b>some</b> <b>or</b> all of the external female genitalia. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone the procedures.|$|E
5|$|From the Greek {{word for}} pan pipes, σύριγξ, {{it is the}} vocal organ of birds. Located {{at the base of}} a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the vocal folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of <b>some</b> <b>or</b> all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{nationalist}} and communist forces resumed {{the civil}} war in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949. In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation of the Arab–Israeli conflict. While European powers attempted to retain <b>some</b> <b>or</b> all of their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.|$|E

5|$|In June 2010 diving {{operations}} {{were carried out}} and the survey report indicated that the aircraft was largely complete, although 5K+AR lay inverted on the seabed, indicating that it ground-looped on landing.

Some items, including two of the Dornier's six MG 15 machine guns, are missing and are believed to have been stolen by unauthorized divers sometime after the aircraft's discovery.|$|E
5|$|In many bathhouses the {{customer}} has {{a choice between}} renting a room or a locker, often for fixed periods of up to 12 hours. A room typically consists of a locker and a single bed (though doubles are sometimes available) with a thin vinyl mat supported on a simple wooden box or frame, an arrangement that facilitates easy cleaning between patrons. In many bathhouses (particularly those outside the United States), <b>some</b> <b>or</b> all of the rooms are freely available to all patrons.|$|E

He was apparently accepted as king by <b>some</b> <b>or</b> all of the Danes in England and in 903 he induced the East Anglian Danes to wage war on Edward.

5|$|Most {{amphibians}} today remain semiaquatic, {{living the}} first stage of their lives as fish-like tadpoles. Several groups of tetrapods, such as the snakes and cetaceans, have lost <b>some</b> <b>or</b> all of their limbs. In addition, many tetrapods have returned to partially aquatic or fully aquatic lives throughout the history of the group (modern examples of fully aquatic tetrapods include cetaceans and sirenians). The first returns to an aquatic lifestyle may have occurred as early as the Carboniferous Period whereas other returns occurred as recently as the Cenozoic, as in cetaceans, pinnipeds, and several modern amphibians.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 2010, it was {{revealed}} that the Glazers were to pay off the remaining £220million contained within the PIK loans by 22 November 2010. The loans were by then accruing interest at a rate of 16.25%, as the club's overall debt had exceeded its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by more than five times. However, the club claimed that none of its own money had been put towards the repayment, raising questions as to how the Glazer family had raised the funds; suggested methods include the sale of a minority stake in the club to a third party, the sale of <b>some</b> <b>or</b> all of the family's other businesses, and – the most likely option – the refinancing of the PIKs with another loan at a lower interest rate.|$|E
5|$|SR 11 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1994. Four years later, several parties, {{including}} District 11 of Caltrans, the City and County of San Diego, the San Diego Association of Governments, and Tijuana were signatories to a Letter of Intent to build the border crossing. The route {{was added to}} the California Freeway and Expressway System in 1999. In 2009, Senate Bill 1486 was passed, and the presidential permit in 2008 allowed for the border crossing to be constructed. By one year later, several alternatives were considered, in terms of constructing <b>some</b> <b>or</b> even none of the interchanges, or removing the proposed toll on the route. State funding is allocated to cover much of the $400 million cost, which does not include the port of entry at another $350 million. The California Transportation Commission endorsed the project in January 2012, and approved the proposed freeway route that December.|$|E
