40|$|The {{biology of}} Typhlodromips swirskii (Athias-Henriot), Typhlodromus negevi Swirski et Amitai and Amblyseius denmarki Zaher et El-Borolossy was studied using Aculus fockeui (Nalepa and Trouessart) active stages as food source. For T. swirskii, {{development}} was faster than in A. denmarki and T. negevi. In A. denmarki, the oviposition period {{was longer and}} reproduction was higher than in both predacious <b>mites.</b> A total <b>of</b> 49. 4, 43. 0 and 32. 3 eggs per female, respectively, were obtained when A. denmarki, T. swirskii and T. negevi were fed on active stages <b>of</b> the peach <b>silver</b> <b>mite.</b> A diet <b>of</b> A. fockeui provided the highest female longevity and mean total fecundity, {{which resulted in the}} highest net reproductive rate (Ro = 35. 568) for A. denmarki. The highest intrinsic rate of increase (rm = 0. 244), finite rate of increase (λ = 1. 2766) and shortest generation time (T = 13. 784) were recorded for T. swirskii. The sex ratio of the progeny was strongly female biased (female/total = 0. 72, 0. 68) when active stages of A. fockeui were provided for A. denmarki and T. swirskii...|$|R

The product was then designed and produced by Cascelloid Ltd. Hack presented Cascelloid with a fresh lemon he acquired at Covent Garden, upon which to base the plastic container. Hack had performed significant searches at several markets to find an optimal model. Cascelloid stated that Hack reviewed and evaluated the entire inventory <b>of</b> <b>lemons</b> at Fortnum and Mason’s, Selfridges, Harrods and Covent Garden, the latter of which involved examining three cases <b>of</b> <b>lemons</b> that contained around 300 lemons in each case.|$|R
