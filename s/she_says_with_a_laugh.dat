[...] Brewster said of moving on from Criminal Minds, [...] "... last year I decided that I wanted to {{challenge}} myself, and doing these episodes of Law & Order: SVU has proven me right." [...] Brewster noted of her character, BC ADA Foster, [...] "I'm despised by the detectives," [...] <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> adding [...] "I've been able to work with everybody, but especially with Mariska Hargitay!" [...] Brewster added that she would be praying to the [...] "Nielsen gods" [...] on Sept. 26. [...] "I'm so torn because I'm such a fan of both shows," [...] she says. [...] "I just hope both shows get great ratings!" ...|$|E

6000|$|But {{with this}} Miss Hetty {{chose to be}} as angry {{as if it had}} been quite a cruel rebuke. [...] "I hate dancing--there--I own it," [...] <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> toss of her head.|$|R
6000|$|DOLPHIN. So I should suppose. (Silence. A {{spasm of}} anguish crosses DOLPHIN'S face; then he reassumes the old Thinker's mask.

6000|$|... "'You!' <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{smile that}} {{reminded}} me of lemon sherbet. I was waiting up-stairs in the slosh, then, and I was right down here by the door, putting some vinegar and cayenne into an empty bottle of tabasco, and I heard all they said.|$|R
5000|$|The girls {{audition}} for an online-commercial for Power.com's new sponsor, but Roxeanne sends them all packing. However, the fun wears off after {{she appears to}} have signed to advertise dog food. [...] "Barky Bark crackers; so tasty the lady wants to eat them herself" [...] <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> plastic smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "Elle ravvole de fous, cher bedid anche!" [...] says Madame Bernstein, {{mimicking}} the Countess's German accent. The Baroness is delighted with her boy's success. [...] "You carry off {{the hearts of}} all the old women, doesn't he, Maria?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sneer at her niece, who quivers under the stab.|$|R
6000|$|Theo {{gives her}} husband a kiss. [...] "My dear, I {{wish they had}} tried," [...] <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sigh. [...] "I was afraid lest--lest Hetty should have led him, you see; and I think she hath the better head. But, from reading this, {{it appears that the}} new lady has taken command of poor Harry," [...] and she hands me the letter:-- ...|$|R

5000|$|Some time later, Costikyan {{is arrested}} in his {{underwear}} inside a hotel. Freddie had tipped off the cops and left with the money. Jjaks and Freddie have since had a falling out, however Jjaks remembers Freddie's dream: {{that she wants to}} live in Las Vegas and be a dancer. He hitchhikes there and finds her living her dream. When he finds her <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> smile: [...] "what took you f***ing so long?" [...] They embrace each other.|$|R
60|$|The girl invites {{him to come}} to her hut in {{the forest}} and verify what <b>she</b> <b>says.</b> <b>With</b> <b>a</b> gesture he signifies that he will follow where she leads. She rises. The crowd gathers round--all are hushed to silence. THE KING, as one entranced, puts aside all who would in any way interfere. The girl precedes him, going from the Pagoda towards the night. When she reaches the great staircase, she beckons, Oriental fashion, with {{downward}} hand. The scene should, in grouping and colour, make for rare beauty.|$|R
6000|$|... 'YOU said!' {{returned}} Mr Codlin. 'Did I {{always say}} that that 'ere blessed child was the most interesting I ever see? Did I always say I loved her, and doated on her? Pretty creetur, I think I hear her now.

6000|$|He {{looked at}} her <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bewildered {{expression}} {{as if he did}} not really understand what <b>she</b> was <b>saying.</b> <b>With</b> <b>a</b> considerable effort he collected himself, stood up, and said, [...] "Now I think I have told you what I feel, and I will only add that I can wait as long as ever you wish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'And {{you came}} mighty near missing the train at Powhatan Junction, too,' <b>says</b> <b>she,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> laugh that sounded {{as good as}} a mileage-book to me.|$|R
6000|$|Pride kept Anna silent till {{her face}} was scarlet, her palms blistered, and her breath most gone. Then, and not till then, did <b>she</b> condescend to <b>say,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gasp, poorly {{concealed}} by an amiable smile,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would go}} blind for thee, Pierre; here, take out these eyes, {{and use them}} for glasses." [...] So <b>saying,</b> <b>she</b> looked <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strange {{momentary}} haughtiness and defiance at Lucy.|$|R

In January 2008 Annalisse told The Sydney Morning Heralds correspondent that [...] "'The one thing I miss is singing,' <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> adding <b>with</b> <b>a</b> laugh, 'And I still can't get used to {{getting up in the}} morning...

6000|$|Just {{then the}} door opened, and Mrs. Sterling entered, {{carrying}} what looked very like a pile of snow-flakes in her arms. Laying this upon the bed, <b>she</b> kissed Christie, <b>saying</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tone and gesture that made the words a benediction: ...|$|R
50|$|From Canada, Agell's {{family moved}} back to Sweden, briefly, then to Hong Kong when she was eleven. She {{graduated}} from the Hong Kong International School, a Lutheran mission school that, <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> was affiliated <b>with</b> <b>an</b> open-minded ecumenical church.|$|R
6000|$|They {{began by}} shaking hands, as {{is always the}} custom in the ring. Then, without any {{preliminary}} sparring, Lady Pippinworth immediately knocked him down; that is to <b>say,</b> <b>she</b> remarked, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little laugh: [...] "How very stout you are getting!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “And now, sir,” <b>says</b> <b>she,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> curtsy, “we {{must have}} no more talk except when mamma is by, as his grace is with us; for he does not half like you, cousin, and is as jealous as the black man in your {{favourite}} play.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Do you?” <b>says</b> <b>she,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> blush; “then, sir, {{you shall}} teach me and Beatrix.” And {{she asked him}} many more {{questions}} regarding himself, which had best be told more fully and explicitly, than in those brief replies which the lad made to his mistress’s questions.|$|R
5000|$|Saina {{was born}} in Kenya on 30 June 1988. She began running as a {{teenager}} in Eldoret, Kenya with hopes to pursue education at Otago Girls High School. Her family had success in distance running, so her sisters mentored her as a youth to prepare her for a national stage of running. Her performance at the African juniors national championship caught the attention of scouts and recruiters. [...] "Saina grew up in Kenya's middle class - [...] "not poor, or rich," [...] <b>she</b> <b>says</b> - <b>with</b> <b>a</b> father who worked as an elementary-school teacher and mother who operated a small business." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{ladies of}} the clergyman's family, {{his wife and two}} sisters-in- law, came in among the bodies often. It grew to be the {{business}} of their lives to do so. Any new arrival of a bereaved woman would stimulate their pity to compare the description brought, with the dread realities. Sometimes, they would go back able to say, 'I have found him,' or, 'I think she lies there.' Perhaps, the mourner, unable to bear the sight of all that lay in the church, would be led in blindfold. Conducted to the spot with many compassionate words, and encouraged to look, <b>she</b> would <b>say,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> piercing cry, 'This is my boy!' and drop insensible on the insensible figure.|$|R
60|$|Fate, however, {{had decided}} that Lord Montfort and Henrietta Temple should become acquainted. She had more than once {{expressed}} a wish to see the Campo Santo; it was almost the only wish that she had expressed since she left England. Her father, pleased to find that anything could interest her, was {{in the habit of}} reminding her of this desire, and suggesting that she should gratify it. But there was ever an excuse for procrastination. When the hour of exertion came, <b>she</b> would <b>say,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> faint smile, 'Not to-day, dearest papa;' and then, arranging her shawl, as if even in this soft clime she shivered, composed herself upon that sofa which now she scarcely ever quitted.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{inevitable}} that a person of so remarkable an appearance and bearing should form a frequent topic in such a village as Iping. Opinion was greatly divided about his occupation. Mrs. Hall was sensitive on the point. When questioned, she explained very carefully {{that he was an}} [...] "experimental investigator," [...] going gingerly over the syllables as one who dreads pitfalls. When asked what an experimental investigator was, <b>she</b> would <b>say</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> touch of superiority that most educated people knew such things as that, and would thus explain that he [...] "discovered things." [...] Her visitor had had an accident, she said, which temporarily discoloured his face and hands, and being of a sensitive disposition, he was averse to any public notice of the fact.|$|R
6000|$|As Rachel knelt that day, {{the scales}} of self-conceit seemed to have gone. She had her childhood's heart again. Her bitter remorse, her afterthoughts of perplexity had been lulled in the long calm of the respite, and when roused again, even by this sudden sorrow, she woke to her old trust and hope. And when {{she listened to the}} {{expressive}} though calm rehearsal of that solemn sunrise-greeting to the weary darkling fishers on the shore of the mountain lake, it was to her as if the form so long hidden from her by mists of her own raising, once more shone forth, smoothing the vexed waters of her soul, and <b>she</b> could <b>say</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new thrill of recognition, [...] "It is the Lord." ...|$|R
6000|$|Josie rose as she spoke, for {{a glance}} at the clock showed her that her call was a long one; and hard as it was to end this momentous interview, she felt that she must go. Catching up her hat she went to Miss Cameron, who stood looking at her so keenly that she felt as {{transparent}} as a pane of glass, and coloured prettily as <b>she</b> looked up, <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grateful little tremor in her voice: ...|$|R
500|$|Marie: Julien visits Marie and Simon's old apartment, {{where the}} letting agent shows him {{a room that}} Julien chillingly {{recognises}} — it {{is identical to the}} room Marie has prepared. This is where Marie hanged herself, trying to frame Simon in revenge after a terrible row. Julien returns home and Marie silently leads him to the attic where she has prepared a noose, feeling she has to hang herself again. Julien carries her downstairs, and they make love again. She leaves to meet Adrienne, who <b>says</b> that <b>she</b> knows that Marie no longer wants to die. They agree they do not know the rules of their situation. Returning, Marie interrupts Julien about to hang himself {{in a desperate attempt to}} join her. He runs to the kitchen and tries to slit his wrist; Marie stops him and her wrist and his palm are cut. Marie warns him that he will lose all memory of her, but he says that all he wants is for her to be there. Marie slowly covers her face with her hands —"the forbidden sign"— and Julien becomes oblivious to her and unaware of why he is bleeding. Madame X arrives for her letter and he hands it over, confused by her enquiries about [...] "l'autre personne". Madame X burns the letter, freeing Adrienne. Marie cries while watching Julien sleep, and as her tears land on her wrist her cut bleeds. Julien wakes and asks who she is; she replies that she is [...] "the one he loved". He doubts it as she's [...] "not his type", but <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> smile to give her a little time.|$|R
40|$|In {{the lobby}} sit an elderly couple, {{laughing}} and chatting in Amharic. Beside {{them is a}} mother singing a Spanish lullaby to soothe her infant daughter. A young man approaches the receptionist’s desk. “Un momento, por favor, ” <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> smile, picking up the ringing phone. “Unity Health Care. How may I help you?” Beyond the waiting room at Unity Health Care’s Upper Cardozo Health Center in Washington, DC, a foreign-born, new patient with HIV may be receiving an orientation on any given day. In an examination room across the hall, another patient may be receiving screening for tuberculosis (TB). Perhaps he or she came to Unity {{through one of the}} many links that the clinic has with organizations serving immigrants, such as the Ethiopian Community Development Council. Or maybe the patient was enrolled in primary care here and received HIV testing as part of the clinic’s comprehensive approach to care. Unity Health Care is a Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program grantee. It is a shining example of how grantees and providers can help foreign-born people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) overcome significant barriers to HIV testing, care, and treatment. Patients here receive primary and spe-cialty care, dental care, lab services, and case management as well as access to programs like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). A federally funded Community Health Center, Unity has 14 sites in metropolitan Washington, D. C., that did YOU KNOW? Immigrants represent about 12. 6 percent of the U. S. population. 1 Prior to 2010, non-U. S. citizens with HIV were restricted from entering the country unless granted a waiver by the Department of Homeland Security. On January 4 of this year, the HIV travel ban was lifted. 2 Among Hispanic immigrants, the lack of preventive screening contributes to higher rates of liver, cervical, and stomach cancers and higher mortality rates from those cancers than among native-born persons. 3 DEPA R...|$|R

How is old Goody to-day? What a supper she did eat last night, and drink!--drink like a dragoon! No wonder she has got a headache, and keeps her room. Guess it takes her ever so long to dress herself." ...|$|R
5000|$|At the Swan, Hurley {{requests}} {{to speak to}} Libby, and he tearfully apologizes to her for forgetting the blankets. In her dying breath, <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "Michael!", <b>with</b> <b>a</b> look of terror in her eyes. Jack, mistaking her horror as fear for Michael's safety, assures her that Michael is fine. Hurley starts to cry, as does Kate, Sawyer hugs Kate and she cries in his arms. Locke and Mr. Eko are seen making {{their way back to}} The Swan, as the timer starts to sound, the numbers needing to be entered into the computer; the episode ends with Michael in the armory, looking gravely toward the doorway, his plan unfolding.|$|R
6000|$|However, Amy brazened {{her out of}} it all; told her, [...] "Well, {{since you}} think you are so high-born as to be my Lady Roxana's daughter, you may go to her and claim your kindred, can't you?
