Price found the Navy's scheduled sinking of <b>Sterlet</b> fortuitous. Nonetheless, <b>Sterlet</b> was a small World War II-era Diesel-electric submarine of a vastly different design and construction than Scorpion with regard to its pressure hull and other characteristics. Its sinking resulted in three identifiable acoustic signals, as compared to Scorpions 15. The mathematical calculations Price used remain unknown to the public.

50|$|Oligosaprobes {{include some}} green and diatomaceous algae, {{flowering}} plants (for example, European white water lilies), some rotifers, Bryozoa, sponges, mollusks {{of the genus}} Dreissena, cladocerans (daphnids, bithotrephes), dragonfly and mayfly larvae, <b>sterlets,</b> trout, minnows, and newts. Oligosaprobes also embrace a few saprophytes, including bacteria (scores and hundreds per 1 cu mm of water) and organisms that feed on bacteria. The term “oligosaprobe” is usually applied only to freshwater organisms.|$|R
5000|$|Rybinsk {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} Slavic {{settlements}} on the Volga River. The place was first recorded by chroniclers in 1071 as Ust-Sheksna, i.e. [...] "the mouth of the Sheksna". During this period the settlement was a regional center for craft and metal based produce and for trade. In the mid-13th century, Ust-Sheksna was laid waste by invading Mongols. For the next few centuries, the settlement was referred to alternatively as Ust-Sheksna or Rybansk. From 1504, it was identified in documents as Rybnaya Sloboda (literally: [...] "the fishing village"). The name is explained by the fact that the settlement supplied the Muscovite court with choice sturgeons and <b>sterlets.</b> In the 17th century, when the sloboda was capitalizing on the trade of the Muscovy Company with Western Europe, it was rich enough to build several stone churches, of which only one survives to the present. More old architecture may be found in the neighborhood, including the very last of Muscovite three-tented churches (in the Alexandrov Hermitage) and the Ushakov family shrine (on Epiphany Island).|$|R
2500|$|On 24 September, Trigger got {{underway}} to take station off {{the east coast}} of Formosa and perform life guard patrol for bomber strikes due on 12 October. The morning of the strikes, she rescued a pilot from aircraft carrier [...] whose burning plane had crash-landed nearby. On 19 October, as the invasion of the Philippines was about to begin, Trigger contacted a convoy of two Takao-class heavy cruisers, one Nagara-class cruiser, two other light cruisers, and several destroyers with air cover. Trigger had no chance to fire but reported the contact. On 30 October, she launched four torpedoes at a tanker but missed. She then fired another four from her stern tubes and heard one hit the target before running up the periscope to watch the other three blow off part of the stern, but the ship did not sink. Trigger went deep as 78 depth charges were rained down on her within the next hour, but caused no damage. The damaged 10,021ton tanker Takane Maru was later sunk by submarines [...] and [...] The next morning, Trigger received word from Salmon that she had been heavily damaged by depth charges and was unable to submerge. Trigger rendezvoused with Salmon that night and was joined by [...] and <b>Sterlet</b> to escort the damaged submarine to Saipan. They were provided with air cover from the Mariana Islands and arrived at Tanapag Harbor on 3 November. A week later, Trigger departed with six other submarines but was ordered to discontinue her patrol on 17 November and returned to Guam.|$|E
50|$|HMS <b>Sterlet</b> was a Royal Navy S-class {{submarine}} {{which was}} launched on 22 September 1937 and {{fought in the}} Second World War. <b>Sterlet</b> is one of 12 boats named in the song Twelve Little S-Boats. So far she {{has been the only}} ship of the Royal Navy to be named <b>Sterlet.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At 22:11, <b>Sterlet</b> {{unleashed}} four [...] "fish" [...] at the pursuing escort. The setup was hasty at best. All four missed, and she prudently opened {{range to}} reload {{and prepare for}} another attack on the damaged freighter still afloat. As she approached, her quarry was dead in the water, down by the stern, and partially enveloped by smoke. Two of the escorts were thrashing about the surrounding waters, indiscriminately shooting and dropping depth charges. At 22:35, one of them passed between <b>Sterlet</b> and her victim. The submarine shifted her sights on him and, four minutes later, sent three torpedoes streaking at him. The frigate sighted the wakes, immediately turned into them, and rapidly closed on <b>Sterlet.</b> This pursuit forced <b>Sterlet</b> to retire; and, after {{more than an hour}} of running from the frigate and undergoing his bombardment, she managed to open range by firing four torpedoes [...] "down the throat" [...] at him. This tactic did not allow her to escape, and the chase continued until the frigate turned broadside to fire both his forward and after guns in salvo. That curious maneuver allowed <b>Sterlet</b> to open range to 8000 yd at which point, the enemy's radar wavered. <b>Sterlet</b> shut her radar down, came hard to starboard and opened out. A minute before midnight, <b>Sterlet</b> turned her radar back on. The screen was clear; she had escaped.|$|E
40|$|Our {{research}} {{was performed on}} juvenile <b>sterlets</b> (Acipenser ruthenus), aged between 346 - 431 days, maintained in five round pools (Ø= 3 m, V= 6 m 3, h- 100 cm) and fed with a commercial extruded pellet (3 mm granulation, 48 % CP, and 10 % EE). Body weight and total body length on 30 individuals from each tank were determined every two weeks. Weighing and somatic measurements achieved {{at the end of}} experimental period (standard length-l, body weight-G, maximum body high–H, maximum body perimeter (Pmax), head length–lh,, caudal peduncle length-lp) allowed us to calculate the following body indices: profile index, thickness index, Fulton index, Kiselev index, meat index. Statistical analysis was performed by using the SPPS IBM 22 and Minitab 16 software. Data were reported as Mean±Sx at a significant level of p< 0. 05. Testing differences between means was realized by ANOVA completed with post-hoc Tukey test. Results obtained led to conclude that specimens analyzed had a good maintenance and feeding, an adequate development, a high proportion of meat, an elongated body and a straight back, and they are eligible for selection...|$|R

50|$|Other {{than the}} damage caused by depth charges, Salmon {{suffered}} only a few small-caliber hits from the enemy vessels. Escorted by <b>Sterlet,</b> Trigger, and , she made it to Saipan. She was given one-third credit for the 10,500-ton tanker, Jinei Maru which was eventually sunk by a torpedo from <b>Sterlet.</b> On 3 November, she moored alongside submarine tender , in Tanapag Harbor, Saipan.|$|E
5000|$|Not to be denied, <b>Sterlet</b> {{made another}} {{approach}} on the convoy. This time, {{four of the}} six fish she launched scored. Three hit a large gasoline tanker, and the fourth plowed into a freighter. The tanker, Jinei Maru, is known definitely to have gone down. <b>Sterlet</b> spent the remainder of the day evading the attacks of the escorts. That night, she allowed a hospital ship to pass unmolested. She attacked a small freighter with four torpedoes on 29 October, but had to surface and sink it with her deck gun. On 31 October, she made a night surface attack on a tanker previously damaged by [...] and apparently sank it with a spread of six torpedoes. <b>Sterlet</b> then joined Trigger in escorting the damaged [...] into Saipan.|$|E
50|$|A rare type of caviar {{known as}} Imperial Caviar, from the <b>Sterlet</b> {{sturgeon}} (Acipenser ruthenus), a now nearly extinct species of sturgeon from the Caspian Sea, is sometimes incorrectly labeled as Sevruga, {{as well as}} the even rarer Golden Caviar from the albino <b>Sterlet,</b> the caviar being yellow in color. “Pressed sevruga caviar” can also be found, made of a blend of Osetra and Sevruga caviar that has been heated in a saline solution.|$|E

50|$|Sterlet’s final war patrol {{commenced}} on 5 July {{when she}} departed Midway for {{the vicinity of}} Kii Suido and Bungo Suido. Except for one occasion when she shelled oil storage tanks and a power plant near Shingu on Honshū, this whole patrol was given over to lifeguard duty for the crews of carrier planes and B-29 Superfortresses pummelling Japan. <b>Sterlet</b> rescued a New Zealander and a Briton, one well up in Kii Suido. The Japanese capitulation brought {{an end to the}} patrol, and <b>Sterlet</b> reached Midway on 23 August.

50|$|In 1869, Ovsyannikov pioneered {{artificial}} reproduction of <b>sterlet.</b> A {{series of experiments}} with fish breeding won him a gold medal from the Free Economic Society. In 1871, he discovered the vasomotor center and determined its precise limits in the medulla oblongata.|$|E
50|$|Following {{fitting-out}} and shakedown training, <b>Sterlet</b> departed Key West, Florida, on 1 May to {{join the}} Pacific Fleet. The submarine reached Pearl Harbor on 13 June, and she immediately plunged into another round of training exercises to prepare for her first war patrol.|$|E
50|$|Sterlets require {{relatively}} large ponds with good water conditions, and may get entangled in {{plants such as}} blanketweed. They may require special food such as <b>sterlet</b> sticks, as {{they are unable to}} digest the vegetable proteins usually found in commercial fish foods.|$|E
5000|$|The {{submarine}} had {{one more}} anxious moment during the patrol, when she encountered a Q-ship screened by a small escort. She launched six torpedoes at the [...] "freighter," [...] which disconcertingly turned and closed <b>Sterlet.</b> She succeeded in evading that aquatic chameleon and returned to Midway on 10 June.|$|E
50|$|The <b>sterlet</b> (Acipenser ruthenus) is a {{relatively}} small species of sturgeon from Eurasia native to large rivers that flow into the Black Sea, Azov Sea, and Caspian Sea, as well as rivers in Siberia as far east as Yenisei.

She returned to San Diego, California, on 23 June and resumed West Coast operations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sterlet,</b> however, {{managed to}} emerge victorious over two enemy ships. In the late {{afternoon}} of 29 May, she encountered a large and a small freighter, escorted by three patrol frigates. At 16:41, the submarine tried for a good setup, but failed due to the convoy's rapid change in course. She lost sound contact around 1720 and, 40 minutes later surfaced for a daylight end-around. At 1822, the lookouts sighted smoke; and, by 21:53, the submarine was in position to launch a night surface radar attack. She launched six torpedoes, three at each freighter. Two minutes later, one of the escorts peeled off and made for <b>Sterlet.</b> She immediately went right full rudder, all ahead at flank speed. In another two minutes, two torpedoes plowed into {{each of the two}} targets—four explosions within 20 seconds. At 22:05, the enemy frigate began random depth charge attacks. Three minutes later, the smaller of the two targets sank by the stern.|$|E
