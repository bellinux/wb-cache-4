Since the financial and operational impact assessments are of different nature, they perform the evaluation of response plans from different perspectives. On the one hand, the RFIA aims at assessing mitigation actions based on their financial benefits to the system, proposing the response plan with the highest RORI index, thus the maximal positive financial gain to the organization. On the other hand, the ROIA aims at assessing mitigation actions based on their potential collateral damage to the system, proposing the response plan with the lowest operational impact, thus the minimal operational negative side effect.|$|E

Moreover, this method introduces a philosophically salient, positive role for survey-style experiments while steering clear of several objections that critics of “positive experimental philosophy” raise. Thus, it provides the experimentalist with a more defensible example of how em-pirical work can have positive philosophical import. For these reasons, experimental explication should appeal to experimental philosophers (at least those working within the positive program) and formal philosophers alike.

Many {{authors have}} suggests classifying by various communication techniques, protocols (session versus sessionless), the programming interface, [5], specific categories included database-oriented, virtual system, middle-tier, gateways, and Web-enabled [25], communication with programming execution and number of participants [32], or ten specific categories [21]. While these classifications cover many aspects of middleware, we will describe a different approach. The term middleware {{has been used to}} describe many different types of software products. Middleware is essentially supplementary software that connects two or more software together. Since there is wide variety of software included under this big umbrella called middleware, categories need to be assigned to further describe and delineate each of these types.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} experiences connected {{to the implementation of}} educational behavior-analytic interventions (ABA) for children with autism in kindergartens. The research questions and the methodological choices in this investigation evolved based on new experiences {{over the course of the}} research project. Three sub-studies were conducted: a single case study on the implementation of ABA teaching programs specifically targeting joint attention skills for children with autism in kindergartens (Study 1); a questionnaire survey on the experiences of ABA supervisors in implementing ABA in kindergartens (Study 2); and an interview study on the experiences of ABA teachers in implementing ABA in kindergartens (Study 3). During Study 1, it appeared that the teaching intensity of the targeted ABA teaching programs varied largely from what was initially planned for all four of the participating children. Under those conditions, the learning outcomes of the children also varied. With regard to Study 2, the survey data obtained from 29 ABA supervisors indicated that many children with autism who receive ABA in Norwegian kindergartens do not receive the number of teaching hours being planned for them. There also seems to be quite a large number of kindergartens that lack teaching teams and who receive supervision less than what is generally recommended to obtain the optimal outcome from ABA. With regard to Study 3, the interview data obtained from 10 ABA teachers illustrated how implementation factors such as compatibility, complexity, client responsiveness, and supervision can be manifested when ABA is implemented in the kindergarten. A main finding was that in some cases there <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>conflicting</b> opinions within the kindergarten about whether ABA is right for the child, something that was interpreted to reflect a conflict between the categorical and the relational perspectives of special education.

However, the empirical evidence about the value and applicability of this concept for the public sector is missing (De Leede et al., 2011). It is interesting to investigate this, because the characteristics of the public sector <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>conflicting</b> with the values and principles of NWoW. The tendency of public managers to establish increased levels of review and approval, for example, is opposite to working based on mutual trust. This study aims to contribute to insights in the effects of NWoW in the Dutch public sector. More specifically, this study concentrates on the question if NWoW indeed leads to an improvement in productivity, well-being and the work-life balance of individual employees of a Dutch municipality. Following Bijl (2007, 2009), NWoW is defined as a change in the following four dimensions: technology, physical workplace, organisation and motivation. This study examines how these four dimensions influence the productivity, well-being and work-life balance of public sector employees. Regression analysis show that the dimensions of NWoW indeed {{have a positive effect on}} the productivity and well-being of employees. Further analysis confirmed that the four dimensions of NWoW can be seen as a second order formative construct. The regressions analysis of the second order formative construct reveals also a positive relation between NWoW and the productivity and well-being of employees. However, the results of this study cannot confirm the relation between the dimensions of NWoW and the work-life balance or between the second order formative construct and the work-life balance...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{question}} is explored how a broadly defined concept is constructed and operationalized {{within the context of a}} complex, collaborative action research (CAR) project in the field of primary education. The focus of this research is on the CAR project ‘Pro Sense’ which is a collaboration between university researchers and practitioners, in particular primary school teachers and ambulatory caregivers. The aim of the project is to conceptualize and measure the so called ‘sustainable’ development of pupils. Peculiar to collaborative action research is the involvement of practitioners as co-researchers (Sagor, 1993; Greenwood & Levin, 2007). For this reason specific validity criteria are imposed on CAR projects. The value of a high level of participation in methodological decision-making is expressed in so called ‘dialogical’ and ‘democratic’ validity (Burns, 1999). Besides this point, conceptualization in social sciences also needs to be done according to certain methodological and epistemological criteria (Penrod & Hupcey, 2005; Babbie, 2007). In this study an analysis is made of how the process of co-construction and operationalization proceeds in terms of (1) the scientific validity criteria for research concepts and (2) the specific CAR criteria of participation and practical utility of research results. This study concludes that although these various validity criteria <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>conflicting</b> at first sight, in the reality of Pro Sense these demands are actually strongly related. Moreover, due to various interventions and factors during the project the conclusion had to be made that the construction of a valid scientific concept was hardly achieved. This led to the conclusion that working with a rather broad and theoretically undeveloped concept as ‘sustainable child development’, in a complex CAR project as Pro Sense, either needs a project design wherein conceptual exploration is the main objective or a more operationalized definition needs to be provided in the beginning of the study...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of HistoryJack M. HollDonald J. MrozekAs president, Dwight Eisenhower {{believed}} that nuclear weapons, both fission and fusion, were permissible and desirable assets {{to help protect}} U. S. national security against the threat of international communism. He championed the beneficent role played by nuclear weapons, including both civilian and military uses, and he lauded the simultaneous and multi-pronged use of the atom for peace and for war. Eisenhower's assessment of the role and value of nuclear technology was profound, sincere, and pragmatic, but also simplistic, uneven, and perilous. He desired to make nuclear weapons as available, useful, and ordinary for purposes of national security as other revolutionary military technology from the past, such as the tank or the airplane. He also planned to exploit nuclear technology {{for a variety of}} peaceful, civilian applications that he also believed could contribute to national strength. 	However, Eisenhower did not possess a systematic view of national security in the nuclear age as some scholars have argued. Rather, Eisenhower approached {{the question of how to}} defend national security through nuclear weapons with an array of disparate ideas and programs which worked simultaneously toward sometimes divergent objectives that were unified only by a simple conception of national strength. In this effort, Eisenhower occasionally pursued what might <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>conflicting</b> initiatives, but nonetheless consistently advanced his view that strength through nuclear technology was possible, necessary, and sustainable. 	Because he believed nuclear technology effectively served his goal to defend national security through strength, Eisenhower sought to reverse the perception that nuclear weapons were inherently dangerous by advocating steadily and consistently for the proper and acceptable use of nuclear technology to contribute to the safety of the republic. He conceived policies such as the New Look, massive retaliation, Project Plowshare, and Atoms for Peace in part to convince the American public and the international community of the U. S. 's genuine desire for peace as Eisenhower simultaneously entrenched atomic and thermonuclear weapons into the American national conscience. Through his efforts, Eisenhower made nuclear weapons and nuclear technology ordinary, abundant, and indispensable to U. S. national security in the twentieth century...|$|E
