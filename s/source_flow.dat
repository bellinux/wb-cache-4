While it lasted our {{friendship}} has been good, and its ending shall be good. Moreover, it would have endured for many a year to come had you not sought, Slaughterer, to make good better, and to complete our joy of fellowship and war with the love of women. From that <b>source</b> <b>flow</b> these ills, as a river from a spring; but so it was fated. If I fall in this fray may you yet live on to fight in many another, and at the last to die gloriously with axe aloft; and may you find a brisker man and a better Watcher to serve you in your need. Should you fall and I live on, I promise this: I will avenge you to the last and guard the Lily whom you love, offering her comfort, but no more. Now the foe draws on, they have travelled round about by the ford, for they dared not face the torrent, and they cried {{to me that they}} are sworn to slay us or be slain, as Dingaan, the king, commanded. So the fighting will be of the best, if, indeed, they do not run before the fangs of the Grey People. Now, Chief, speak your word that I may obey it." ...|$|E

The convectively unstable linear gravity modes can excite acoustic modes with similar wave-numbers. The frequencies of the excited oscillations may be qualitatively higher than the temporal variation scales of the <b>source</b> <b>flow,</b> while the frequency spectra of the generated oscillations should be intrinsically correlated to the velocity field of the <b>source</b> <b>flow.</b> We anticipate that this nonresonant phenomenon can significantly contribute to the production of sound waves in the solar convection zone.

An analysis of the present nitrogen policy measures shows them {{to be effective in}} reducing individual flows and effects of nitrogen. The implementation of new policy measures increases the risk that opportunities will be missed or that unexpected counterproductive impacts will occur. Therefore, new nitrogen measures should ideally be developed within the integrated-knowledge framework of <b>sources,</b> <b>flows</b> and effects of nitrogen and policy measurements.
