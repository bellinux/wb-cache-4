His dam (mother) {{hailed from}} Louisiana; Go Man Go {{is thought to}} have gained his <b>swiftness</b> on the track from her. For the first years of Go Man Go's racing career, his owner faced difficulty in registering him with the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA), a matter that remained unresolved until 1958.|$|E
5|$|The war went {{badly for}} the ill-prepared Greeks; the only saving grace was the <b>swiftness</b> {{with which the}} Hellenic Army was overrun. By the end of April 1897, the war was lost. The worst {{consequences}} of defeat for the Greeks were mitigated by {{the intervention of the}} King's relations in Britain and Russia; nevertheless, the Greeks were forced to give up Crete to international administration, and agree to minor territorial concessions in favor of the Turks and an indemnity of 4million Turkish pounds.|$|E
5|$|According to a myth in many cultures, cats have {{multiple}} lives. In many countries, they {{are believed to}} have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while in Turkish and Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six. The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and <b>swiftness</b> cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.|$|E
5|$|Aided by Motley's <b>swiftness</b> and size, the Browns won the NFL {{championship}} in 1950, their first {{season in the}} league. In October 1950, Motley set an NFL record that stood for more than 52 years when he averaged over 17 yards per rush against the Pittsburgh Steelers, with 188 yards on 11 carries. In December 2002, quarterback Michael Vick of the Atlanta Falcons rushed for 173 yards on 10 carries against the Minnesota Vikings, eclipsing Motley's average. Motley also had a 69-yard rushing and 33-yard receiving touchdowns in the game. While Motley did not factor in the Browns' championship game win against the Los Angeles Rams, he {{led the league in}} rushing with 810 yards in 1950 despite averaging fewer than 12 carries per game. He was a unanimous first-team All-Pro selection.|$|E
5|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have been}} advanced {{to explain the}} <b>swiftness</b> and ease of the initial Lombard advance in northern Italy. It {{has been suggested that}} the towns' doors may have been opened by the betrayal of the Gothic auxiliaries in the Byzantine army, but historians generally hold that Lombard success occurred because Italy was not considered by Byzantium as {{a vital part of the}} empire, especially at a time when the empire was imperilled by the attacks of Avars and Slavs in the Balkans and Sassanids in the east. The Byzantine decision not to contest the Lombard invasion reflects the desire of Justinian's successors to reorient the core of the Empire's polices eastward.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins and}} {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between the}} three main groups of amphibians {{is a matter of}} debate. A 2005 molecular phylogeny, based on rDNA analysis, suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs. It also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic (around 250 million years ago), before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe-finned fish. The briefness of this period, and the <b>swiftness</b> with which radiation took place, would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils. There are large gaps in the fossil record, but the discovery of a proto-frog from the Early Permian in Texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs. Molecular analysis suggests that the frog–salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the palaeontological evidence indicates. Newer research indicates that the common ancestor of all Lissamphibians lived about 315 million years ago, and that stereospondyls are the closest relatives to the caecilians.|$|E
5|$|The {{silky shark}} {{is one of}} the three most common pelagic sharks along with the blue and oceanic whitetip sharks, and counts among the most {{numerous}} large oceanic animals in the world with a population of at least tens of millions. Compared to the other two species, it is less strictly pelagic with the greatest numbers found in offshore waters associated with land, where food is more readily obtained than farther out in the truly open ocean. The silky shark is an active, inquisitive, and aggressive predator, though it will defer to the slower but more powerful oceanic whitetip shark in competitive situations. When approaching something of interest, it may seem inattentive, sedately circling and sometimes swinging its head from side to side. However, it can respond with startling <b>swiftness</b> to any shift in its immediate surroundings. This shark is often found around floating objects such as logs or tethered naval buoys.|$|E

Kulothunga Chola III and his son, yuvaraja Rajaraja Chola III were driven into exile.|$|E
25|$|Frescoes covered every {{surface that}} was not more richly finished. The main artist was one Famulus (or Fabulus {{according}} to some sources). Fresco technique, working on damp plaster, demands a speedy and sure touch: Famulus and assistants from his studio covered a spectacular amount of wall area with frescoes. Pliny, in his Natural History, recounts how Famulus went {{for only a few}} hours each day to the Golden House, to work while the light was right. The <b>swiftness</b> of Famulus's execution gives a wonderful unity and astonishing delicacy to his compositions.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, {{the men on}} the barges {{that had}} been pushed past the entry point by the river's current had {{struggled}} to bring them back to a landing. More citizens rushed out to defend the city against the new group of marauders. Schenck's force, divided and beset at all sides, was pushed back to the river. Several of the soldiers managed to push the barges into the river, and pull some of their comrades to safety, but it was difficult work: the darkness and the <b>swiftness</b> of the current made steadying the barges difficult, and the angry citizens of Nijmegen were firing arrows and small arms at the marauders. Eventually the soldiers forwent the ropes and scaling hooks, and simply jumped into the river, hoping to swim to the barges.|$|E
25|$|The Nez Perce {{believed}} in spirits called weyekins (Wie-a-kins) which would, they thought, offer {{a link to}} the invisible world of spiritual power". The weyekin would protect one from harm and become a personal guardian spirit. To receive a weyekin, a seeker would go to the mountains alone on a vision quest. This included fasting and meditation over several days. While on the quest, the individual may receive a vision of a spirit, which would {{take the form of a}} mammal or bird. This vision could appear physically or in a dream or trance. The weyekin was to bestow the animal's powers on its bearerfor example; a deer might give its bearer <b>swiftness.</b> A person's weyekin was very personal. It was rarely shared with anyone and was contemplated in private. The weyekin stayed with the person until death.|$|E

25|$|Once Moore {{made his}} {{presence}} known Napoleon responded with customary <b>swiftness</b> and decisiveness. The Spanish were defeated {{and no longer}} an organized threat. His army was generally concentrated while the enemy was dispersed. With the initiative firmly in his grasp, Napoleon seized the chance to destroy Britain's only field army. When Moore realized he was in serious danger of being trapped he called off his advance and went into headlong retreat. This epic dash and chase would cover more than , during which the British cavalry and the infantry of the Light Brigade were used to cover the movements of Moore's army after their retreat began on 25 December. This saw them engage the French in small rearguard clashes, including defeating a French cavalry force and capturing General Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes at Benavente before entering the mountains of Galicia, and another at Cacabelos where General Colbert-Chabanais {{was killed by a}} British rifleman.|$|E
25|$|Military and militia groups began {{rounding}} up and killing Tutsis en masse, {{as well as}} political moderates irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. The killing swiftly spread from Kigali to all corners of the country; between April 6 and the beginning of July, a genocide of unprecedented <b>swiftness</b> left between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsis (800,000 is a commonly noted number) and moderate Hutus dead at the hands of organized bands of militia (Interahamwe). Even ordinary citizens were called on by local officials to kill their neighboring Tutsis who were called Inkotanyi - Cockroaches by the local radio stations inciting fear and hatred. The president's MRND Party was implicated in organizing many aspects of the genocide. The Hutu genocidaires were abetted by the Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines broadcasting hate speech advocating violence against Tutsis. It broadcast {{at the same time as}} Radio Muhabura broadcast from Uganda, sponsored by the RPF and their Ugandan allies.|$|E

500|$|Horses in the Middle Ages {{were rarely}} {{differentiated}} by breed, {{but rather by}} use.

[...] Words such as 'courser' and 'charger' are used interchangeably (even within one document), and where one epic may speak disparagingly of a rouncey, another praises its skill and <b>swiftness.</b>|$|E
500|$|Bellman was a skilful and {{entertaining}} performer of his songs, accompanying {{himself on the}} cittern, putting on different voices, and imitating the sounds made by a crowd of people. He is unusual, even unique, among major poets in {{that almost all of}} his work was [...] "conceived to music". His achievement has been compared to Shakespeare, Beethoven, Mozart, and Hogarth. Bellman, however, was no great playwright, nor a major classical composer. His biographer, Paul Britten Austin, suggests that the comparison with Hogarth is closer to the mark. Bellman had a gift for using elegant classical references in comic contrast to the sordid realities of drinking and prostitution. The way he does this, at once regretting and celebrating these excesses in song, achieves something of what Hogarth achieved in engravings and paint. The art historian Axel Romdahl describes Bellman's sensibility {{as if he had been}} a painter: [...] "An unusual <b>swiftness</b> of apprehension, both optical and aural, must have distinguished him." [...] Britten Austin agrees with this, noting that [...] "When [...] words and music have faded into silence it is the visual image which remains." [...] Jan Sjåvik comments in the Historical Dictionary of Scandinavian Literature and Theater that [...] "Bellman's achievement consists in taking this humble and unrecognized literary form [...] and raising it to a genre that became impossible to ignore, while in the process creating songs and characters that have become an indispensable part of Sweden's literary and cultural heritage." ...|$|E
500|$|Horses {{were known}} to humans on {{what is now the}} Iberian Peninsula as far back as 25,000 to 20,000 BC, as shown by cave {{paintings}} in the area. Among the local wild horses originally used by humans were the probable ancestors of the modern Lusitano, as studies comparing ancient and modern horse DNA indicate that the modern [...] "Lusitano C" [...] group contains maternal lineages also present in wild Iberian horses from the Early Neolithic period. [...] These ancient horses were used for war, with clear evidence of their use by Phoenicians around 1100 BC and Celts around 600 BC. It is believed that these invaders also brought horses with them, contributing outside blood to the ancestry of the modern Iberian breeds. [...] By 800 BC, the alliance known as Celtiberians had been formed by the Iberians and Celts, and from this point on the horses bred in this area were renowned as war horses. Xenophon, writing around 370 BC, admired the advanced horsemanship and riding techniques used by Iberian horsemen in war, made possible in part by their agile horses. Legend claimed that mares of the area were sired by the wind (hence their amazing <b>swiftness,</b> passed onto their foals), and one modern hypothesis suggests that the bond between Iberian humans and horses was the initial inspiration for the centaur, which was believed to come from the area of the Tagus River. Later invasions into the area by Carthaginians and Romans resulted in these civilizations establishing stud farms that bred cavalry horses for the Roman army from local stock.|$|E
500|$|On 17 September 1460, Skanderbeg sent 500 cavalry to Barletta in Apulia {{under the}} command of his nephew, Constantine, who at the time was 22 or 23 years old.

The {{addition}} of 500 Albanian cavalry, even though they were not cuirassed like their Italian counterparts, increased his force's effectiveness. By this time, Ferdinand had lost most of his territory, and was left with some fortresses in Apulia and the area surrounding Naples. The Angevins were swiftly approaching Naples and Ferdinand prepared a counteroffensive. He first secured what he had by putting Roberto del Balzo Orsini in command, but Orsini's incompetence held up the Neapolitan army. By this time, Skanderbeg's men had already arrived, and Ferdinand commenced his offensive. Albanian light-cavalry warfare was first noted here for its <b>swiftness</b> and effectiveness where they were reported to travel [...] per day as opposed to the Italian cavalry which could only travel [...] The Albanians were encouraged by Ferdinand to fight in their traditional manner and to raid the territory; Ferdinand informed Francisco Sforza that the Albanians had been devastating Apulia and taking whatever loot they could. These events worried the Angevins and prompted Giovanni Orsini to try to stop Skanderbeg from pouring his men into Italy. René d'Anjou had been particularly surprised by Skanderbeg's action since he believed that he had never offended the Albanian.|$|E
