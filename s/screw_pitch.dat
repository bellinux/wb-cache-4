50|$|Example: A CNC {{vertical}} mill has {{a vertical}} lead screw on the Z-axis. A low lead <b>screw</b> <b>pitch</b> (i.e. 5 {{turns per inch}} or fewer) means when the driving motor power is removed such as by turning the machine off, {{the weight of the}} spindle will cause the lead screw to rotate as the spindle motor falls down. Obviously this is a bad thing. The solution to prevent back-driving is to use a finer (higher) lead <b>screw</b> <b>pitch</b> (i.e. 10tpi or greater) or have a locking mechanism.|$|E
50|$|In manual linear stages, {{a control}} knob {{attached}} to a lead screw is typically used. The knob may be indexed to indicate its angular position. The linear displacement of the stage {{is related to the}} angular displacement of the knob by the lead <b>screw</b> <b>pitch.</b> For example if the lead <b>screw</b> <b>pitch</b> is 0.5 mm then one full revolution of the knob will move the stage platform 0.5 mm relative to the stage base. If the knob has 50 index marks around its circumference, then each index division is equivalent to 0.01 mm of linear motion of the stage platform.|$|E
40|$|Rational schemes of {{the surface}} {{treatment}} were developed {{as a result of}} the research on the basis of analysis of the geometry of screw surface and kinematics of the formation of the varied <b>pitch</b> <b>screw</b> line, as well as the shaping surfaces theory. The analysis of three schemes of varied <b>pitch</b> <b>screw</b> surface treatment on productivity was carried out; this allowed establishing the spheres of their rational employment.

50|$|A {{variant of}} the Archimedes screw {{can also be found}} in some {{injection}} molding machines, die casting machines and extrusion of plastics, which employ a <b>screw</b> of decreasing <b>pitch</b> to compress and melt the material. It is also used in a rotary-screw air compressor. On a much larger scale, Archimedes's <b>screws</b> of decreasing <b>pitch</b> are used for the compaction of waste material.|$|R
50|$|A thread gauge, {{also known}} as a <b>screw</b> <b>pitch</b> gauge or pitch gauge, is used to measure the pitch or lead of a screw thread. The {{uppermost}} gauge in the image is an ISO metric pitch gauge, the larger gauge in the center is for measuring the Acme thread form, and the lower gauge is for Whitworth screws.|$|E
50|$|In some {{automated}} stages a {{stepper motor}} {{may be used}} in place of, or in addition to a manual knob. A stepper motor moves in fixed increments called steps. In this sense it behaves very much like an indexed knob. If the lead <b>screw</b> <b>pitch</b> is 0.5 mm and the stepper motor has 200 steps per revolution (as is common), then each revolution of the motor will result in 0.5 mm of linear motion of the stage platform, and each step will result in 0.0025 mm of linear motion.|$|E

50|$|The {{solid liquid}} mixture is {{fed into the}} closed {{rearward}} portion of the scroll. The rotation movement of the scroll, screen, and basket allows the liquid to pass through from the openings on the screen (via centrifugal force). The solid remains will be separated according to size due to the difference of the angular velocity of the helical screw and the basket. The helical screw pushes the solid material to be discharged to the forward end of the scroll. The processing time depends on helical <b>screw</b> <b>pitch</b> and the angular velocity difference. It may also {{be influenced by the}} design of the scroll feed opening. The solid particles exiting are usually collected via a conveyor in the collection unit.|$|E
40|$|The {{blocking}} {{between two}} snapping rollers will seriously constrict the harvesting efficiency for corn harvester.

The comparative experiment between fixed <b>screw</b> <b>pitch</b> rib snapping rollers and variable <b>screw</b> <b>pitch</b> rib snapping rollers illustrated that variable <b>screw</b> <b>pitch</b> ribs can avoid corn-stalk blocking effectively, and it can improve working efficiency by 56. 7 %.

In order to implement this mode of conservation tillage at a production scale, a cutter was developed in this study.

With the increase of titanium fiber diameter, the decrease of screw diameter and <b>screw</b> <b>pitch,</b> the porosity of porous titanium decreases.

40|$|Abstract: A global {{study of}} {{geometry}} and material properties of orthopedic screws was performed, considering {{not only the}} effect of each single factor (<b>screw</b> <b>pitch,</b> number of threads, fillet angle, etc.) but also their interactions with respect to bone density. The stress patterns resulting from different screw geometries and bone densities were analyzed using finite element techniques, taking into account different levels of osseointegration between the screw and the bone. These numerical models where validated through experimental pull-out tests, where a pull out force of 120 N produced localized failure of the last thread (stresses above 0. 42 MPa). The results of the numerical simulations were then summarised using a multi-factorial parametric analysis. This demonstrated the great relevance {{of the interaction between}} bone density and <b>screw</b> <b>pitch,</b> showing that the optimal <b>screw</b> <b>pitch</b> can vary by more than 25 % for different densities (0. 35 g/cm 3 and 0. 47 g/cm 3, respectively). The parameters calculated by means of the multi-factorial analysis allow the pull out force to be estimated for different osseointegration levels, different screw geometries and material properties, and for different bone densities. The final objective is to determine the best choice of implant for each individual patient. 1...|$|E

We did a series of experiments with the weighing system, and give some recommendations. Discharging is also described in detail.

40|$|A {{number of}} recent screw designs is {{analyzed}} for melting performance, using a simple analytical approach based on Tadmor’s original work.

Screws by Barr, by Dray and Lawrence and by Kim are shown to approach the ideal com-pression screw.

The micron-sized Archimedes screws were fabricated using the two-photon polymerization technique. Free-floating screws trapped by optical tweezers align in the laser irradiation direction and rotate spontaneously. The influences of the <b>screw</b> <b>pitch</b> {{and the number of}} screw blades have been investigated in our previous studies. In this paper, the blade thickness and the central rod of the screw were further investigated. The experimental results indicate that the blade thickness contributes to rotational stability, but not to rotational speed, and that the central rod stabilizes the rotating screw but is not conducive to rotational speed. Finally, the effect of the numerical aperture (NA) of the optical tweezers was investigated through a demonstration. The NA is inversely proportional to the rotational speed...|$|E
40|$|A length-N spin chain {{with the}} √(N) (=v) -th {{neighbor}} interaction {{is identical to}} a two-dimensional (d= 2) model under the screw-boundary (SB) condition. The SB condition provides a flexible scheme to construct a d> 2 cluster from an arbitrary number of spins; the numerical diagonalization combined with the SB condition admits a potential applicability to a class of systems intractable with the quantum Monte Carlo method due to the negative-sign problem. However, the simulation results suffer from characteristic finite-size corrections inherent in SB. In order to suppress these corrections, we adjust the <b>screw</b> <b>pitch</b> v(N) so as to minimize the excitation gap for each N. This idea is adapted to the transverse-field Ising model on the triangular lattice with N< 32 spins. As a demonstration, the correlation-length critical exponent ν is analyzed in some detail...|$|E
