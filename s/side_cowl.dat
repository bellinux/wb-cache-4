5000|$|In 2007, quite {{a number}} of changes were made to the US-spec STI. Due to Subaru's {{decision}} to reduce costs by cutting the amount of aluminum used, the US-spec STI no longer receives the J-spec Spec C control arms. The control arms are now the aluminum ones used on the Japan-spec revision A and B non-Spec C STis. The high caster angle has been reduced, which in turn reduces the wheelbase from 100" [...] to 99.4". The rear sway bar has decreased in size from 20 mm to 19 mm. The gear ratios of second, third and fourth gears have been made longer (higher ratio) in order to improve fuel economy and drivability, which inadvertently reduces 1/4 mile drag racing times due to the ability to trap 114 mi/h km/h in 4th gear, without the shift to 5th. The transmission oil pump that was deleted in the 2006 model year was also brought back for the 07 model year transmission. The EJ257's cylinder heads have been redesigned to improve cooling, and the sodium-filled exhaust valves have been deleted. Pistons are the same as previous years. The alternator is changed from a 90A rating to 110 amps. The rear Limited Slip Differential is now a Torsen unit, considered an upgrade over the previous model's clutch type unit. The turbo has also been changed to the VF43, which has a different wastegate actuator than the VF39. The <b>side</b> <b>cowl</b> braces are stiffer than the 2006MY. The engine mounts are once again the hard rubber mounts used prior to 2006. On the interior, there is an audio jack that replaces the ashtray, a rear center armrest with trunk pass-through and a 120 W audio system.|$|E

40|$|To {{find out}} how to reduce the noise from the lower parts of cars and electric-current {{collecting}} system on the Shinkansen, we conducted the following field test and model experiment: (1) To estimate the effect of each of the countermeasures taken, the noise level of cars in the Series E 2 - 1000 was measured at a 25 -meter point {{from the center of the}} structure with sound level meters and with microphone array in the single-pantograph running mode, where these cars were provided with the pantograph sound insulation plates, bogie <b>side</b> <b>cowls,</b> sound absorbing structure around the bogie and circumferential bellows. (2) We conducted numerical simulation and scale model experiments in an anechoic room to examine the noise reducing effect when sound absorbing material was provided on the car body surface in order to reduce the multiple reflections between the noise barrier and car body. 2. 1 Overview The Series E 2 - 1000 cars were provided with low-noise pantographs and low-noise insulators in order to reduce the noise of the electric-current collection system. Running tests were conducted to examine the electric-current collecting performance of the low-noise pantograph and low-noise insulator, and the effect of reducing the noise of the electric-current collecting system. For further reduction of the noise from the electric-current collecting system, the pantograph was temporarily provided with a sound insulation plates. To reduce the number of noise sources, a single-pantograph running test was performed to evaluate the effect. In the meantime, the noise from the electric-current collecting system has been reduced in recent years because of some countermeasures. As a result, the noise from the lower parts of cars of the car shows a relative increase. In these running tests, therefore, we temporarily provided a bogie <b>side</b> <b>cowls</b> and circumferential bellows whose effects had been recognized in a wind tunnel test as countermeasures for the noise form the lower parts of cars. At the same time, the sound absorbing structure was applied around the bogie to estimate of the noise reduction effect. 2. 2 Each measure and test schedule Table 2. 1 summarizes the relationship between countermeasures for each section and type of measurements.

This was replaced by an improved electric starter on most two-stage Merlin powered Spitfires and, from late 1942 the blister was only seen on a few aircraft. The Type C wing was fitted as standard. Some mid and most late production Spifire Mk IXs and all Mk XVI were fitted with the Type E wing. While Spitfire IXs converted from Mk VCs had the large teardrop fairings on the upper surfaces, on the majority of Mk VIIs, VIIIs, IXs and XVIs the teardrop shaped blisters covering the Hispano feed motors were reduced in size and more streamlined than those on the Mk VC. According to A.P 1565J P & L (Spitfire IX, XI and XVI Pilot's Notes) the red painted undercarriage indicator rods, which projected through the tops of the wings when the undercarriage was down, were used only on early production Mk IXs. When fitted these rods supplemented an [...] "Electric visual indicator" [...] mounted on the instrument panel. The indicator rods seemed to be fitted on all Mk VIIs and VIIs, supplementing the electric visual indicator. A light for the retractable tailwheel was mounted on the instrument panel, just below the main visual indicator.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} provide as much power as {{possible}} from the DB 601, the 100 used exhaust ejectors for a small amount of additional thrust.

25|$|In April 1921 two prototypes {{were ordered}} by the Air Ministry to Specification 5/20. The first prototype, {{allocated}} serial number J6860, was built as a Type 56 and designated a Victoria I, the second J6861 was built as a Type 81 Victoria II. The Type 56 had two 450hp Napier Lion engines with large frontal radiators and were fitted directly onto the lower mainplanes, the fuel tanks were placed under the inboard section of the bottom mainplane. The prototype J6860 first flew from Brooklands, Surrey on 22 September 1922. The Type 81 flew in January 1923, and initially differed only in having the fuel tanks under the top mainplane. It was later modified by replacing the flat <b>sided</b> engine <b>cowling</b> with more streamlined nacelles with the radiators between the undercarriage legs, as fitted in the Virginia II bomber.|$|R

The pilot had an open cockpit under the wing and behind him the four passengers sat in an enclosed cabin with four windows. Passenger comfort was a priority and up to 100 kg of baggage could {{be placed in the}} hold. At the rear the fin was triangular and broad, carrying a balanced rudder which extended down to the keel. Tailplane and elevators were mounted on top of the fuselage. The C.91 had a tailwheel undercarriage with its mainwheels on a single axle longer than the fuselage width, sprung to a pair of V-struts to the lower fuselage longerons.|$|R

Fuel injection must therefore be tai- lored to the internal flow of the engine; flow which has been virtually unexamined until now. Simulation of the flow through a Mach 12 REST engine was performed, leading to a characterization of a complex three-dimensional shock structure, which in turn drives the generation of swept separated flow regions in the inlet and combustor.

5000|$|The {{limousine}} {{was originally}} {{powered by a}} [...] four-cylinder, inverted, water-cooled engine, produced in 1913 by Grégoire, which drove a three-bladed propeller; both the propeller and the inverted engine were unusual at the time, though Grégoire had used this engine arrangement in his 1910 monoplane. The engine was cooled with a cylindrical Lamblin radiator mounted above the central wing, where the fuel tank was located. Behind the engine, its upper parts under a narrow cowling, the mahogany plywood-covered, elm-framed fuselage was rectangular in section but tadpole-shaped in profile, deep below the wing but slender aft. It also slimmed aft in plan, though not so strongly. Its enclosed, spacious cabin, which seated pilot and passenger side-by-side, was below the wing with Cellon windows angled {{to the line of}} flight on each <b>side</b> of the <b>cowling,</b> aided by <b>side</b> and roof windows. It also provided a space for baggage and for tools. There was a port side door for access.|$|R
5000|$|The air inlets {{allowed the}} SR-71 to cruise at over Mach 3.2 while keeping airflow into the engines {{at the initial}} subsonic speeds. Mach 3.2 was the design point for the aircraft, its most {{efficient}} speed. At the front of each inlet, a pointed, movable cone called a [...] "spike" [...] (Inlet cone) was locked in its full forward position {{on the ground and}} during subsonic flight. When the aircraft accelerated past Mach 1.6, an internal jackscrew moved the spike up to 26 in inwards, directed by an analog air inlet computer that took into account pitot-static system, pitch, roll, yaw, and angle of attack. Moving the spike tip drew the shock wave riding on it closer to the inlet cowling until it touched just slightly inside the cowling lip. This position reflected the spike shock-wave repeatedly between the spike centerbody and the inlet inner <b>cowl</b> <b>sides,</b> and minimized airflow spillage which is the cause of spillage drag. The air slowed supersonically with a final plane shock wave at entry to the subsonic diffuser.|$|R
50|$|Both prototypes {{were very}} similar to the Hurricane in general appearance, and shared some of its {{construction}} techniques. The front fuselage used the same swaged and bolted duralumin tube structure, which had been developed by Sydney Camm and Fred Sigrist in 1925. The new design featured automobile-like side-opening doors for entry, and used a large 40 ft (12 m) wing that was much thicker in cross-section than those on aircraft like the Spitfire. The rear fuselage, from behind the cockpit, differed from that of the Hurricane in that it was a duralumin, semi-monocoque, flush-riveted structure. The all-metal wings incorporated the legs and wheel-bays of the wide-track, inward-retracting main undercarriage. The two models were also very similar to each other; the R plane had a rounder nose profile and a ventral radiator, whereas the N had a flatter deck and a chin-mounted radiator. The fuselage of the Tornado ahead of the wings was 12 in (30 cm) longer than that of the Typhoon, the wings were fitted 3 in (76 mm) lower on the fuselage, and the radiator was located beneath the fuselage. The X-24 cylinder configuration of the Vulture required two sets of ejector exhaust stacks on each <b>side</b> of the <b>cowling,</b> and that the engine was mounted further forward than the Sabre in order to clear the front wing spar.|$|R
5000|$|The all-metal, {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{was basically}} oval in cross-section, changing to a tapered, semi-triangular oval behind the cockpit canopy, {{with a maximum}} depth of 1.35 m (4 ft 5 in). An unusual feature of the Ki-61 was that the engine bearers were constructed {{as an integral part}} of the forward fuselage, with the <b>cowling</b> <b>side</b> panels being fixed. For servicing or replacement, only the top and bottom cowling panels could be removed. A tapered, rectangular supercharger air intake was located on the port-side cowling. Behind the engine bulkhead were the ammunition boxes feeding a pair of synchronized 12.7 mm (.50 in) Ho-103 machine guns which were set in a [...] "staggered" [...] configuration (the port weapon slightly further forward than that to starboard) in a bay just above and behind the engine. The breeches partly projected into the cockpit, above the instrument panel. The Ho-103 was a light weapon for its caliber (around 23 kg/51 lb) and fired a light shell, but this was compensated for by its rapid rate of fire. The ammunition capacity was limited, having only around 250 rounds for each weapon. A self-sealing fuel tank with a capacity of 165 L (44 US gal) was located behind the pilot's seat. The windshield was armored and there was a 13 mm (.51 in) armor plate behind the pilot. The radiator and oil cooler for the liquid-cooled engine were in a ventral location below the fuselage and wing trailing edge, covered by a rectangular section fairing with a large, adjustable exit flap.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to gain insight into the complex flow phenomena, governing the aerodynamics of intakes for airbreathing space vehicles. Complementary to CFD-simulations, reliable wind tunnel experiments remain necessary for validation as well as for understanding physical effects and their impact on the overall design. The hypersonic blow down tunnel H 2 K with its long test duration ensures a fully established flow field to simulate external and internal compression processes of different inlet models with three ramps. The dominating flow phenomena of the inlet flow are viscous interactions of oblique shocks induced by the compression ramps with the boundary layers developing on the wall surfaces. An increase of the ramp angles lead to higher degree of pressure recovery, but is also linked to larger heat loads. Within this study, comprehensive information about thermal wall loads is gained by IR-thermography, i. e. thermal mapping of the PTFE model surfaces. In order to provide accurate heat transfer measurements, model temperature increase and radiation effects are taken into account by an instationary numerical data reduction algorithm. Complementary information about the inlet flow is obtained by flow visualizations and detailed pressure measurements. The influence of model parts like <b>side</b> walls or <b>cowl</b> are demonstrated and separation regions are determined with respect to the boundary layer state. The experimental results show a strong influence of the boundary layer on the flow field at the compression ramps. At the highest examined Reynolds number and with applied boundary layer tripping, the formation of the separation bubble was found to be sensitive on changes of the flow or the model conditions. Altogether, the experimental results on the hypersonic inlet flow provided a substantial insight into the aerodynamics of hypersonic propulsion components to support the design of future hypersonic space vehicles...|$|R
