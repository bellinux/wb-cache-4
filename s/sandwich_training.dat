40|$|We {{simulate}} the observed statistical relationship between ENSO and the rainfall regime {{of the upper}} Blue Nile using the tropical-band version of the regional climate model RegCM 4 (or Reg-TB). An ensemble of nine simulations for the 28 -year period 1982 – 2009 is completed to investigate the role of ENSO in modulating rainfall over the upper Blue Nile catchment. Reg-TB shows a good skill in simulating the climatology of temperature, outgoing long-wave radiation patterns as well as related atmospheric circulation features during the summer season (i. e. the rainy season over the Blue Nile catchment). The model also succeeds in reproducing the observed negative correlation between Pacific SST and rainfall anomalies over the Blue Nile catchment, {{and in particular the}} association of droughts over the Blue Nile with El Niño events that start in April–June. We thus propose that observations and model forecasts of Pacific SST during this season could be used in seasonal forecasting of summer rainfall over the upper Blue Nile region.

40|$|Abstract — The {{management}} of placement and work-integrated learning {{has long been}} sup-ported by paper-based systems, databases, spreadsheets and E Mail communications. Unfortu-nately, in today’s fast-moving world {{most of these are}} inflexible to changes and cannot respond quickly enough, especially during out-of-term. They are also staff intensive. Many placement web sites convey information but lack the interactive features to allow action on the information provided. Since 2002 engineering students at the University of Ulster have been using an interactive, web-based placement system to achieve and run their placement. This paper details the design fea-tures of this professionally-developed placement management system, known as OPUS (Online Placement University System), in relation to students, companies, academic staff and administra-tors. Operational experience over six years is related to the pedagogy of work-integrated learn-ing and to evolving good practice. The ease and flexibility of use, especially for students, place-ment providers and administrators, will be demonstrated using the features of the system. The paper concludes with comments by users and an assessment of its impact on placements. The UK’s Association for <b>Sandwich</b> Education and <b>Training</b> (ASET) endorses OPUS as achieving almost all of the requirements in its guide for online systems...|$|R

40|$|Our current {{evidence}} {{base for}} predicting outcome following an acquired brain injury (ABI) identifies {{factors such as}} the severity and impact of the injury, as well as pre-injury information as potential predictors. However current physical, medical and neuropsychological predictors are inadequate. There {{is a great deal of}} confusing and conflicting information which makes it difficult for the professionals involved in the care of those who have suffered an ABI to determine how much improvement an individual can be expected to make and what is the appropriate intensity of a rehabilitation programme. As a result patients can receive a range of treatments from different services over several years without indicators to reliably gauge outcome for all the effort both patients and staff put into this change process. The empirical research reported here suggests that limitations with current outcome predictors are that they fail to consider the individual as an active participant in their recovery process. This research explores the utility of the theory of learning potential and dynamic assessment as a tool in the field of ABI to assess the potential of an individual to adapt, and their ability to engage in the recovery process. Learning potential measures a latent or dormant ability that is brought out by a third party during dynamic training. It was predicted that dynamic testing, as opposed to simple static test administration of the same tests, could reveal important additional information to predict outcomes of ABI. In this research dynamic testing involved a pre and post test administration that <b>sandwiched</b> a <b>training</b> element. Learning potential using the Explicit Verbal Learning system was investigated with an adapted, dynamic version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Non-Verbal Learning potential was investigated with a dynamic version of the Ruff Light Trail Learning Test (RULIT) and Latent Implicit potential to learn using the Tower of Hanoi (ToH). A Rasch Analysis Model was used to examine the data in terms of the construct validity and hierarchy of the items of each test and the individuals who completed it, both pre and post-training. Individuals were grouped into different dynamic learner classifications according to their position on this scale. The results indicate a clear advantage in outcome prediction using dynamic testing. Of the three aspects considered, the measure of learning potential that added most to our understanding about the individual and outcome was the assessment utilising the Verbal Learning system (Dynamic WCST). The assessment measuring Latent Implicit learning potential (ToH) also added significantly to predicting ABI outcome. The assessment of learning potential using the Non-Verbal/Visuospatial Learning system (RULIT) however, did not add further information to help prediction of outcome. The information from the above model guided multiple regression analyses to examine the predictors of ABI outcome using each of the measures of the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) as the dependent variables. Independent variables were Dynamic Verbal learner status (derived from Rasch); socio-economic status; severity of injury; predicted pre-injury intellectual functioning; education levels and current intellectual functioning. With integration status as the dependent variable (measured by the Total CIQ), Dynamic Verbal learner status and socio-economic status were the only significant predictors. Subscales tapping specific aspects of integration were not predicted by any the independent variables other than Social Integration scores, which were predicted only by pre-injury and current intellectual functioning. Collectively these results indicate that learner status may help determine the extent to which an individual can adapt following an acquired brain injury and that this latent ability significantly influences their outcome. These dynamic assessments have clinical implications in determining the level of support or treatment that an individual may require...|$|R
40|$|Title: Designing a Qualitative Study into Multiple Work Integrated Learning (WIL) Experiences. Authors: Lisa Ward, Dr Tina McAdie, Alison Bravington, Professor Nigel King Group / institution: University of Huddersfield. Conference theme(s) covered: Challenges and Innovations in {{the design}} and {{delivery}} of WIL Sub-theme: Impacts of WIL on graduate outcomes and employability Background / context: Universities are forever looking for the perfect Work Integrated Learning (WIL) model: the one that gives students the best chance of a graduate job, fits in ever changing needs of a diverse student population and can be delivered with minimum administrative overhead to the institution. Aims: Researchers at the University of Huddersfield have been exploring psychological factors related to WIL as part in a worldwide study led by Drysdale (Drysdale et al., 2010). The initial analysis of our UK quantitative data set indicated that the number of different WIL experiences a student undertook significantly increased self-reported measures of hope, agency and goal-orientation. The aim of this qualitative study is to explore a variety of student placement experiences in more depth to tease apart experiential aspects of their placements and how these relate to the constructs identified as significant in the previous study. This obviously has strategic implications for the way we deliver WIL both at our institution and across the sector. Method / approach: The use of qualitative techniques aims to move the focus on to the experiential aspects of students’ work placements through focus groups and individual semi-structured interviews. The interviews will potentially use a reflective tool to facilitate dialogue about the abstract concepts measured in the survey. This study will investigate how students relate their work placement experiences to softer skill development identified by our survey research, and how these skills are built up across multiple placements. Was it a case of ‘The more, the merrier’? Results / discussion: This paper will describe the methodological challenges faced {{in the design}} and analysis of our research, including how to facilitate in-depth reflection on work placements, and how to anchor broad concepts such as ‘hope’ and ‘agency’ to specific experiences encountered in the working environment. Conclusions / implications: The identification of an effective method of reflection and analysis of the experiential details of work placements will allow the student voice to be heard, and illuminate important aspects of their experiences. This could then be used to facilitate teaching and learning in this area. Keywords: Multiple, WIL, Qualitative, Interviews, Focus groups.
