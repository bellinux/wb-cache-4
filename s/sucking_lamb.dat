Results {{showed that the}} {{characteristics of}} the carcass of suckling lamb were similar for both types of production systems pointing out that organic production system did not affect fatness or muscle development. However, organic meat was darker (higher L * and a * values) probably related with the higher amount of exercise, although fat was not more yellow. In contrast consumers did not consider organic meat darker and there were not significant differences in appearance related with the similar conformation. These results reflect that consumer perceive organic meat as at least as good as conventional production not only regarding environmental quality but also regarding carcass quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} effect of feeding system and time of the year on the in vivo and carcass characteristics of lambs slaughtered at the Cooperative Cooperaliança (Guarapuava-PR). Ile de France lambs and their crossbreds (n= 253) were evaluated at slaughter with 39. 6 kg of mean body weight in three periods between April and September 2010. Four feeding systems for finishing of lambs were identified: a) grazing dams + lambs with creep-feeding for lambs (n= 67); b) no supplemented, grazing dams + lambs (n= 47); c) grazing dams + lambs, all of them supplemented with concentrate (n= 30); d) irregular system of feeding (n= 109). Measurements on lambs were carried out in vivo and by ultrasound before slaughter and the carcass measurements were taken before and after chilling. Lambs delivered for slaughter between the end of August and the first half of September showed better results (p < 0. 05) for muscle development, dressing percentage and fat thickness in the carcass compared to that slaughtered in April and June. It was concluded that the feeding system with supplementation for dams and <b>sucking</b> <b>lambs</b> resulted in better characteristics for body and carcass measurements compared to other systems. ...|$|R

60|$|Then, {{as to the}} vulture, {{it was not a}} true vulture nor a {{strictly}} true eagle, but a carrion-hawk, a bird {{the size of a small}} eagle, blackish brown in colour with a white neck and breast suffused with brown and spotted with black; also it had a very big eagle-shaped beak, and claws not so strong as an eagle's nor so weak as a vulture's. In its habits it was both eagle and vulture, as it fed on dead flesh, and was also a hunter and killer of animals and birds, especially of the weakly and young. A somewhat destructive creature to poultry and young <b>sucking</b> <b>lambs</b> and pigs. Its feeding habits were, in fact, very like those of the raven, and its voice, too, was raven-like, or rather like that of the carrion-crow at his loudest and harshest. Considering the character of this big rapacious bird, the Polyborus tharus of naturalists and the carancho of the natives, it may seem strange that a pair were allowed to nest and live for years in our plantation, but in those days people were singularly tolerant not only of injurious birds and beasts but even of beings of their own species of predaceous habits.|$|R

40|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} breeds of sheep, used for the milk production in Croatia, are the sheep from Pag, Brač, Cres, Istrian and Travnik΄s sheep, different crossbreeds and, recently, East Friesian sheep. The {{aim of the research}} was to determine the genotype effect on lactation period, milk yield and protein and fat content, which are important in cheese making. The longest lactation period (213 days) had East Friesian sheep, while the highest total milk production (294 kg) and the highest production of milk fat (13. 38 kg) and proteins (11. 88 kg) had crossbreeds (Cres sheep x East Friesian x Awassi). However, the highest content of milk fat (8. 12 and 7. 81 %) and proteins (6. 36 and 6. 26 %) were established in Istrian and Pag sheep milk. The longest milking period (145 days) and the shortest suckling period (28 days) was found in Pag sheep, while the longest suckling period was found in Istra (78 days) and East Friesian (74 days) sheep.

40|$|Behaviour during {{lactation}} and {{its relationship}} with mammary health was investigated in 12 dairy ewes (six with single lambs and six with twins) for 42 d after lambing. Behavioural recordings were made. Samples of teat duct material and of mammary secretion were collected for bacteriological and cytological examination. Ewes performed similar patterns of behaviour as those described in the literature for meat breeds, but with some differences. No negative maternal behaviours were observed; ewes showed reduced "Grooming" and "Sniffing" immediately post-partum. Of 480 duct or secretion samples, 39 and 3, respectively (P < 0. 001), yielded bacteria. There {{was no difference in}} the frequency of bacterial isolation from ewes suckling singles or twins: 46 and 54 % of isolates, respectively (P = 0. 637). There was greater frequency of bacterial isolation during the first stage of lactation (day 0 -day 3), 0. 125, compared with the second (day 4 -day 11), 0. 083, the third (day 12 -day 30), 0. 063, and the fourth (day 31 -day 42), 0. 069 (P < 0. 001). There was also greater frequency of positive California Mastitis Test scores during the first stage of lactation, 0. 917, compared with that in stages 2 (0. 550), 3 (0. 140) and 4 (0. 181) (P < 0. 001). There was decreasing duration of "Sucking attempt" and "Successful suck" throughout lactation (P < 0. 05). There was increasing frequency of "Hindering sucking" and of "Head up posture" from first to subsequent stages of lactation (P = 0. 038 and P = 0. 002), whilst "Hindering sucking" coincided with end of "Sucking bouts" of lambs. It is concluded that termination of <b>lamb's</b> <b>sucking</b> activity by the ewe when her mammary glands have been emptied may prevent damage to the teat and likely development of mastitis. Furthermore, frequent and longer <b>sucking</b> events by <b>lambs</b> during early lactation, may contribute to increased bacterial recoveries from mammary glands of ewes...|$|R
40|$|We aimed (i) to {{determine}} differences in bacterial flora of teat duct and mammary gland of ewes {{before and after}} suckling, (ii) to evaluate factors potentially affecting those. We collected samples of teat duct material and mammary secretion from 11 ewes immediately before and after <b>sucking</b> by <b>lambs,</b> as well as 120 min later. We processed samples bacteriologically and compared changes in infection by the Sign Test. We isolated bacteria from 3. 5 % duct and 1. 5 % secretion samples before suckling. Respective figures post-suckling were 10. 6 % and 2. 0 %, and 120 min later 6. 8 % and 1. 5 %. We recorded differences in infection of duct samples before and after suckling in 40 cases; bacteria were isolated before suckling from six samples, whereas after it from 34 (p < 0. 001). Also, we recorded differences in samples collected after suckling and 120 min later in 12 cases; bacteria were isolated immediately post-suckling from eight samples, whereas 120 min later from four (p = 0. 375). No significant changes were seen for secretion. We found neither difference between ewes with single or twin lambs, nor among stages of lactation. Mostly, we isolated staphylococci: 70 % of isolates before suckling, 80 % of isolates after it, 91 % of isolates 120 min later. After suckling we also isolated two Mannheimia haemolytica strains. Suckling predisposes to entrance of bacteria into the teat; however, increased teat infections {{did not result in}} mammary infections. Isolation of M. haemolytica post-suckling indicates that lambs act as source of infection for this pathogen...|$|R
40|$|We {{collected}} {{samples of}} teat duct material and mammary secretion from ewes in three farms (flock A, polyparous n = 7; flock B, polyparous n = 6, primiparous n = 4; flock C, polyparous n = 4) : 14 samples immediately after <b>lambing</b> (before <b>sucking</b> of <b>lambs),</b> 244 samples during the suckling period and 156 samples during the milking period. Conventional bacteriological techniques were used. The results were modeled using survival analysis, initially by the Kaplan-Meier method {{and then by}} the Cox Proportional Hazards method. Then, we calculated the minimum true risk of an "at-risk" teat or mammary gland being infected and analyzed these data with STATA using the GLLAMM program for Generalised Linear Latent and Mixed Models. During the suckling period, bacteria were isolated from 52 (21 %) duct material and 19 (8 %) secretion samples; respective results for the milking period were 20 (13 %) and 9 (6 %). There was an increased risk of duct rather than secretion samples being infected (P 0. 4 and 0. 1, respectively). There were no differences between isolation of bacteria from duct (P > 0. 5) or secretion (P > 0. 7) samples among primiparous and polyparous animals. Most bacterial isolates were staphylococci. Persistent isolation of the same bacterial species from duct material samples obtained from a particular ewe was recorded with five Staphylococcus spp. and two Mannheimia haemolytica isolates. The results indicate that infections of the teat duct can take place easily; however, not all infections result to infection of the mammary gland. The results support experimental evidence that defence mechanisms of the healthy teat are able to limit the infection. Maintenance of healthy teats contributes to effective defence mechanisms, and coupled with minimal infections of the teat duct, would contribute to the prevention of mastitis in ewes.

40|$|Objective of {{the work}} was to study whether Mannheimia haemolytica may be {{transmitted}} {{from the mouth of}} the lambs into the teat of the dam during sucking. We compared bacterial populations within the teat duct and milk of ewes immediately before and immediately after <b>sucking</b> by the <b>lambs.</b> Tonsils of lambs of the ewes were swabbed. M. haemolytica strain DAG 21 T recovered from a teat duct of a ewe was compared to strain DAG 21 R recovered from the tonsils of her lamb by using 16 s rRNA sequencing. We used those two isolates and another one of known pathogenicity, for challenging ewes: (i) 2 mm deep into healthy teats, (ii) 2 -mm deep into teats with chapping lesions or (iii) into the cistern of healthy mammary glands. Of samples collected before suckling, 20 / 792 were bacteriologically positive, and of those after, 50 / 792 were bacteriologically positive (P 0. 9. Results provide clear evidence that suckling by lambs can lead to transmission of M. haemolytica into the teats of the ewes; the bacteria have the potential to cause mastitis if circumstances are favourable.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{restricted}} suckling on productive performance and carcass traits of growing lambs was determined. Twenty-one naturally <b>sucked</b> male Comisana <b>lambs</b> {{were divided into}} three equal weight groups with differing suckling management systems: 1) only maternal milk (C); 2) only maternal milk until 15 d of age and, from 16 d of age to slaughter, maternal milk, concentrate and hay ad libitum (T 1); 3) only maternal milk until 15 d of age and, from 16 d to 30 d of age, maternal milk, concentrate and hay ad libitum, and, from 31 d of age to slaughter, only concentrate and hay ad libitum (T 2). Average daily weight gain (ADG) and milk and feed intake were calculated. Ewe milk was collected from each group. At slaughter (63 d) live weight and carcass measurements were recorded. The overall mean of total milk collected was 22. 7 and 41. 6 kg ewe- 1 for T 1 and T 2, respectively. Suckling management system significantly affected ADG, milk intake, dressing percentage, and percentages of intestines, stomachs, offals, and kidney fat.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effects of different suckling systems in non-dairy sheep on the production and components of milk, <b>sucking</b> behavior and <b>lamb</b> growth from day 4 after lambing until the lambs were 4 weeks old. The sixteen ewes with their lambs were used to compare restricted suckling time (R) and free suckling time (F) methods. The F lambs were maintained with mothers and suckled ad libitum during day. The R lambs were removed from their dams and allowed to suckle their dams for 15 min during morning and afternoon period. After two weeks of age, all lambs were encouraged to consume roughage alfa alfa as ad libitum to stimulate their ruminal activity. Daily milk intakes of R lambs were low, while F lambs consumed more milk in 1 st and 3 rd weeks. Therefore, F lambs gained more weight in these weeks. The R lambs {{have been shown to}} result in lower sucking duration and higher frequency as compared to F lambs until 4 th week.

50|$|Northern Italy, mountainous in many parts, {{is notable}} for the alpine cheeses of the Valle d'Aosta, the pesto of Liguria, and, in Piedmonte, the Alba truffle. In the Alto Adige, the {{influence}} of neighboring Austria {{may be found in}} a regional repertoire that includes speck and dumplings. In the north, risotto and polenta have tended to serve the staple function taken by pasta across the rest of the country. Italy's center includes the celebrated culinary regions of Tuscany — famous for its olive oil and bean dishes — and Emilia-Romagna — home of prosciutto di Parma, parmigiano-reggiano, and ragù — the latter now produced (and traduced) worldwide as spaghetti alla bolognese. Southern Italy includes the hearty food of Lazio in which meat and offal frequently figure, but also the vegetable-focused fare of Basilicata, historically one of Italy's poorest regions. The islands of Sicily and Sardinia have distinctively different foodways. The former is notable for its many sweet dishes, seafood, and citrus fruit, while Sardinian cuisine has traditionally looked to its hilly interior with a cuisine centered on <b>lamb,</b> <b>sucking</b> pig, breads, and pecorino sardo.

40|$|Maternal {{and social}} {{behavior}} in multiparous Pelibuey ewes was assessed under intensive production system. The social behavior was recorded {{several days before}} and during birth. Mother-young behavior during the first hour after birth was recorded. A selective maternal test was performed at 2 hours postpartum. Eight hours after birth, a double choice test was done in mothers to asses their ability to discriminate between the own or alien Iamb. While a similar double choice test was performed in 12 hours-old lambs. The agitation index when the ewes were tested without companions was lower in parturient ewes than in 145 days pregnant ewes and non pregnant ewes [parturient ewes: (- 0. 59 +/- 0. 9), 145 days pregnant ewes: (2. 6 +/- 0. 7) and non pregnant ewes (4. 2 +/- 0. 9) P < 0. 05]. During the first hour after birth the latency to stand up, to begin {{to look for the}} udder and to suck was shorter in male than female lambs, also the male <b>lambs</b> <b>sucked</b> for longer time than females (P < 0. 05). During this time mothers emitted more high-pitched bleats than low-pitched bleats (P < 0. 05). Besides, the ewes got shorter latencies to lick the area of head and thorax of the lamb than its tail, but they licked more frequently the lamb's tail and thorax (P < 0. 03). Two hours postpartum all mothers were selective, they showed clear preference to accept to the udder their own lamb and reject actively the alien ones (P < 0. 05). At eight or 12 hours, mothers and lambs spent longer time watching and staying with their own familiar animal than with the alien ones (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Objective of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} effects of the procedure followed for udder drying-off (i. e., progressive or abrupt cessation of lactation) in subsequent mammary infection and development of mastitis. In ewes of group A (n = 19), drying-off took place progressively during a period of 22 days; in ewes of group B (n = 12), udder drying-off took place abruptly. Samples of teat duct material and of milk for bacteriological and cytological examination were collected before start of the drying-off procedure, as well as on two occasions after the subsequent lambing: the first immediately after lambing - before the <b>lambs</b> <b>sucked</b> their dam for the first time (15 ewes: 9 group A and 6 group B) or up to the 1 st day after lambing (16 ewes: 10 group A and 6 group B) and the second on the 4 th or 5 th day after lambing (all ewes). Median time to first teat duct or mammary infection post-partum was 0 days (teat ducts and mammary glands) for group A and 2. 25 and 0 days (teat ducts and mammary glands, respectively) for group B (P > 0. 38). Of the 33 bacterial isolates obtained, 79 % were coagulase-negative staphylococci. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in the post-partum frequency of teat duct infection (P > 0. 13), of mammary infection (P > 0. 8), of subclinical mastitis (P > 0. 78) or of abnormal findings in a mammary gland (P > 0. 11). No significant differences were seen between the two groups in the post-partum incidence risk of any of the outcomes studied: teat duct infection (P = 0. 545), mammary infection (P = 0. 647), subclinical mastitis (P = 0. 476) or abnormal findings in a mammary gland (P = 0. 259). No significant differences were evident between the two groups in cure rate of abnormal findings in a mammary gland (P = 0. 847). The results support a hypothesis that the procedure for udder drying-off (i. e., progressive or abrupt cessation of lactation) does not affect the risk of subsequent mammary infection and development of mastitis.

40|$|In {{the first}} 3 days of life, triplet lambs, {{especially}} the smaller triplets, are less capable of surviving than twins and singles. However, whether differences in behaviour and survival of lambs within triplet litters persist after this period is unknown. This trial examined {{the differences in}} sucking behaviour and milk intake between the light, medium and heavy lambs within a triplet litter at 8 - 17 days of age, with the lamb rank based on birth weight. Of 28 triplet carrying ewes, only 10 complete litters survived to at least 8 days of age and {{could be used for}} this trial. After 4 hours of separation, the lambs were returned to the ewe and the behaviour of the lambs and ewe was observed for a period of 15 minutes. The abdominal girth and body weight of the lambs were measured before and after the sucking period. At 8 - 17 days of age, triplet lambs still differed in terms of weight (P= 0. 001) and abdominal girth (P= 0. 002); the triplet lambs born lightest were still lightest and had the smallest abdominal girth. However, there were no statistical relationships between <b>lamb</b> rank and <b>sucking</b> behaviour. Light, medium and heavy lambs did not differ in the number of sucking bouts, number of attempted bouts, total sucking duration, mean sucking bout duration, relative sucking duration, teat fidelity or number of butts. Nor did lamb rank affect the behaviour of the ewes (kicks or butts, walking away from lambs) or measures of milk intake such as relative weight gain or girth gain. However, there was a tendency for lamb rank to have an effect on one measure of milk intake (weight gain) (P= 0. 09). The lambs that were lightest at birth tended to gain less weight during the observation period than heavier lambs, particularly those of medium birth weight. There was also a tendency for lamb rank to have an effect on relative girth gain (P= 0. 08). The lambs born lightest tended to gain more girth relative to their original girth than the heaviest lambs. The only measure of sucking behaviour that tended to differ with lamb rank was the frequency of teat switching (P= 0. 09); medium lambs tended to switch teats more often than the heaviest lambs. Overall, weight gain {{is likely to be the}} most accurate indicator of milk intake; based on this variable, lambs born lightest appear to have ingested less milk than their heavier siblings, despite the lack of differences in <b>sucking</b> behaviour. These <b>lambs</b> were still lighter and smaller at 8 - 17 days of age, suggesting that they had lower growth rates and potentially lower chances of survival. Further research should aim to determine whether ewes and lambs can adapt their sucking behaviour to cope with triplet litters, instead of twins or singles, or whether ewes should be selected for higher milk production. In addition, the effect of different management strategies (e. g. fostering or weaning of the lightest lamb or providing milk supplement) on triplet lambs’ milk intake, growth and survival should be tested...|$|R
