5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of the rigging survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll {{have been used to}} determine how the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the foremast and mainmast had two and three square sails respectively; the mizzen mast had a lateen sail and a small <b>square</b> <b>sail</b> and the bonaventure mizzen had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a <b>square</b> <b>sail,</b> and the bowsprit flew a small square spritsail. According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), the yards (the spars from which the sails were set) on the foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.|$|E
5|$|The first udema {{was built}} in 1760 and had two masts (mainmast and foremast) that were {{originally}} rigged with lateen sails. It was later provided with a <b>square</b> <b>sail</b> rig {{similar to that of}} a polacca bark without topgallant sails. It had a low hull with a small quarterdeck structure and an arrangement of guns that was unique for its time. Its main armament consisted of a single line of eight 12-pound guns along the centerline of the ship and two 12-pounders in the bow facing forwards. The centerline guns used pivoting carriages that could be rotated 360 degrees and aimed to either side of the ship, similar to the main guns of the dreadnought battleships of the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|Even {{though no}} longship sail has been found, {{accounts}} and depictions verify that longships had <b>square</b> <b>sails.</b> Sails measured perhaps 35 ft to 40 ft across, and {{were made of}} rough wool cloth. Unlike in knarrs, a longship sail was not stitched.|$|R
25|$|In ancient galleys under sail, most of {{the moving}} power came from a single <b>square</b> <b>sail.</b> It was rigged on a mast {{somewhat}} forwards {{of the center of}} the ship with a smaller mast carrying a head sail in the bow. Triangular lateen sails are attested as early as the 2nd century AD, and gradually became the sail of choice for galleys. By the 9th century lateens were firmly established as part of the standard galley rig. The lateen rig was more complicated and required a larger crew to handle than a <b>square</b> <b>sail</b> rig, but this was not a problem in the heavily manned galleys. Belisarius' Byzantine invasion fleet of 533 was at least partly fitted with lateen sails, making it probable that by the time the lateen had become the standard rig for the dromon, with the traditional <b>square</b> <b>sail</b> gradually falling from use in medieval navigation in the Mediterranean. Unlike a <b>square</b> <b>sail</b> rig, the spar of a lateen sail did not pivot around the mast. To change tacks, the entire spar had to be lifted over the mast and to the other side. Since the spar was often much longer than the mast itself, and not much shorter than the ship itself, it was a complex and time-consuming maneuver.|$|E

25|$|Captain White was {{a veteran}} of {{navigation}} on the upper Willamette River, and later became {{known as one of}} the most intrepid of all steamboat captains. When he was first assigned to the Wright, Captain White hung a <b>square</b> <b>sail</b> on the steamboat as a precaution in case of mechanical failure. When he took the Wright on her first trip up the Snake River, and when she hit a snag near the mouth of the Palouse River, she almost sank before Captain White could beach her. Bailed out and repaired, the Colonel Wright was able to continue her journey. White received a salary of $500 per month, a huge amount of money for the time, and retained the position for several years.|$|E
5000|$|She {{also had}} six masts (said {{to be named}} after the days of a week - Monday being the fore mast and Saturday the spanker mast), {{providing}} space for 1686 m2 of sails (7 gaff and max. 9 (usually 4) <b>square</b> <b>sails),</b> rigged similar to a topsail schooner with a main gaff sail (fore-and-aft sail) on each mast, one [...] "jib" [...] on the fore mast and three <b>square</b> <b>sails</b> on masts no. 2 and no. 3 (Tuesday & Wednesday); for a time mast no. 4 was also fitted with three yards. In later years, some of the yards were removed. According to some sources she would have carried 5435 m2. This amount of canvas is obviously too much for seven fore-and-aft sails and max. 9 <b>square</b> <b>sails.</b> This (larger) figure of sail area lies only a few square metres below that the famous Flying P-Liner Preußen carried - with her five full-rigged masts of 30 <b>square</b> <b>sails</b> {{and a lot of}} stay sails.

25|$|By the 5th century BC, {{the first}} triremes were in use by various {{powers in the}} eastern Mediterranean. It had now become a fully developed, highly {{specialized}} vessel of war that was capable of high speeds and complex maneuvers. At nearly 40m in length, displacing almost 50 tonnes, {{it was more than}} three times as expensive as a two-level penteconter. A trireme also had an additional mast with a smaller <b>square</b> <b>sail</b> placed near the bow. Up to 170 oarsmen sat on three levels with one oar each that varied slightly in length. To accommodate three levels of oars, rowers sat staggered on three levels. Arrangements of the three levels are believed to have varied, but the most well-documented design made use of a projecting structure, or outrigger, where the oarlock {{in the form of a}} thole pin was placed. This allowed the outermost row of oarsmen enough leverage for full strokes that made efficient use of their oars.|$|E
25|$|Ships {{were first}} {{constructed}} {{in a very}} basic {{manner in which they}} used reeds. These ships were in no way able to travel in the Red or Mediterranean Sea, and so their purpose was only to navigate through the Nile. Whenever ships were required to endure longer travels, Egypt often imported cedar wood from Byblos, with whom they had good trade relations. At the same time, they would ask other states that they traded with to supply them with a certain number of ships. This is exemplified in the Amarna letters where we find a request to the King of Cyprus to construct ships for the Egyptian navy. By the time of the Battle of the Sea Peoples, the Egyptians had become experts in constructing ships. Their ships had a single mast with a horizontal <b>square</b> <b>sail</b> on it. One bow was usually decorated with a human skull being crushed by a lion’s head. These ships often had two rudder oars, since built in rudders were not invented at the time. At the same time, they could have been as heavy as 70 or 80 tonnes with around 50 rowers.|$|E
25|$|The keels were wooden boats with {{a pointed}} stern, {{so that the}} bow and stern looked almost the same. They were of shallow draught so that when fully loaded they drew only {{four and a half}} feet. The keels were forty feet long and at least 19 feet wide amidships: a very broad configuration. In 1266 the {{standard}} load of a keel was set at 20 chaldrons (wagonloads) or approximately 17 tons. After 1497 the keel load was frequently increased, until in 1635 it was set at 21.1 tons. A chaldron was a horse-drawn wagon containing 17 cwt of coal. Keels were supposed to be measured by the Kings Commissioners and given a load mark to show when they were full. The keels had a single mast with a <b>square</b> <b>sail</b> attached to a yardarm and two large oars. They had no rudder and so a large sweep was used for steering when the keel was under sail. The oars were used to row when the wind was not favourable. There were also two iron-shod poles for polling the keel through any shallows. The floor of the hold was only two feet below the gunwale to allow for easy loading. The coal was piled high above the top of the hold with wooden boards used to prevent the cargo from sliding. Each keel was manned by a skipper, two crewmen and a boy, known as a ‘pee dee’. The meaning of this title is unknown.|$|E

5000|$|In light breezes, {{the working}} <b>square</b> <b>sails</b> would be {{supplemented}} by studding sails ("stuns'l") {{out on the}} ends of the yardarms. These were called as a regular sail, with the addition of [...] "studding". For example, the main top studding sail.|$|R
50|$|Today, barquentines {{are popular}} with modern tall ship and sail {{training}} operators as their suite of mainly fore-and-aft sails can be operated with ease and efficiency, but the single mast of <b>square</b> <b>sails</b> offers long distance speed and dramatic appearance in port.|$|R
25|$|Belisarius's fleet {{during the}} Vandalic War, as {{described}} by Procopius of Caesarea, was apparently at least partly fitted with lateen sails, making it probable that {{by that time the}} lateen had become the standard rig for the dromon, with the traditional <b>square</b> <b>sail</b> gradually falling from use in medieval navigation. These 6th-century dromons were single-banked ("monoreme") ships of probably 50 oars, arranged with 25 oars on each side. Again unlike Hellenistic vessels, which used an outrigger, these extended directly from the hull. In the later two-banked ("bireme") dromons of the 9th and 10th centuries, the two oar banks (elasiai) were divided by the deck, with the first oar bank was situated below, whilst the second oar bank was situated above deck; these rowers were expected to fight alongside the ship's marines in boarding operations. The Greek scholar Christos Makrypoulias suggests an arrangement of 25 oarsmen beneath and 35 on the deck on either side for a dromon of 120 rowers. The overall length of these ships was probably about 32 meters. Although most contemporary vessels had a single mast (histos or katartion), the larger bireme dromons probably needed at least two masts in order to maneuver effectively, assuming that a single lateen sail for a ship this size would have reached unmanageable dimensions. The ship was steered by means of two quarter rudders at the stern (prymnē), which also housed a tent (skēnē) that covered the captain's berth (krab(b)at(t)os). The prow (prōra) featured an elevated forecastle (pseudopation), below which the siphon for the discharge of Greek fire projected, although secondary siphons could also be carried amidships on either side. A pavesade (kastellōma), on which marines could hang their shields, ran around the sides of the ship, providing protection to the deck crew. Larger ships also had wooden castles (xylokastra) on either side between the masts, similar to those attested for the Roman liburnians, providing archers with elevated firing platforms. The bow spur (peronion) was intended to ride over an enemy ship's oars, breaking them and rendering it helpless against missile fire and boarding actions.|$|E
500|$|The {{accepted}} view is {{that the}} main developments which differentiated the early dromons from the liburnians, and that henceforth characterized Mediterranean galleys, were the adoption of a full deck (katastrōma), the abandonment of the rams on the bow in favour of an above-water spur, and the gradual introduction of lateen sails. The exact reasons for the abandonment of the ram ( [...] ; , embolos) are unclear. Depictions of upward-pointing beaks in the 4th-century Vatican Vergil manuscript may well illustrate that the ram had already been replaced by a spur in late Roman galleys. One possibility is that the change occurred because of the gradual evolution of the ancient shell-first mortise and tenon hull construction method, against which rams had been designed, into the skeleton-first method, which produced a stronger and more flexible hull, less susceptible to ram attacks. Certainly by the early 7th century, the ram's original function had been forgotten, if we judge by Isidore of Seville's comments that they were used to protect against collision with underwater rocks. As for the lateen sail, various authors have in the past suggested that it was introduced into the Mediterranean by the Arabs, possibly with an ultimate origin in India. However, the discovery of new depictions and literary references in recent decades has led scholars to antedate the appearance of the lateen sail in the Levant to the late Hellenistic or early Roman period. Not only the triangular, but also the quadrilateral version were known, used for centuries (mostly on smaller craft) in parallel with square sails. Belisarius' invasion fleet of 533 was apparently at least partly fitted with lateen sails, making it probable that by the time the lateen had become the standard rig for the dromon, with the traditional <b>square</b> <b>sail</b> gradually falling from use in medieval navigation.|$|E
2500|$|The Minnie A. Caine was {{a wooden}} {{single-deck}} four-masted schooner with two tiers of beams. She was [...] long, [...] wide and [...] deep, {{and designed to}} be operated by a crew of ten. All four masts were equipped with topmasts; the foremast was outfitted with a single yard and a <b>square</b> <b>sail.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} their name holds some controversy, {{though it is}} {{strongly}} supported that caravel comes from the Greek word Καραβος, meaning light vessel."The vessel so named which had a real celebrity in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the vessel employed by the Portuguese in their voyages of discovery and by Christopher Columbus in his daring adventure to the westward, was a small structure belonging {{to the family of}} roundships but more graceful in shape than its contemporaries, the nefs, and having narrower quarters. It was a faster sailer, more able, and was better fitted for all enterprises demanding speed and rapid maneuvering." [...] It had square sterns, fore and after castles and fairly high bulwarks, a bowsprit and usually four masts. It is hard to specifically look at the rig because depending on the period and the nationality, the rig was subject to change. The early caravels did not have <b>square</b> <b>sails,</b> though later, <b>square</b> <b>sails</b> were carried on the foremast for running or for bad weather. The most identifiable rig was a four mast vessel with a square-rigged foremast raking far forward and having a round top and three lateen-rigged masts gradually decreasing in size. Looking at exceptions may show that mainmasts occasionally carried a roundtop similar to what was on a foremast. Another type of caravel was with four masts but lateen and <b>square</b> <b>sails</b> were arranged so that the first and fourth masts were lateen sails while the second and third masts were <b>square</b> <b>sails.</b> Theses varieties of ships changed based on exploration while most of them were around an eighty-ton range.|$|R
50|$|A yard is a spar on a mast {{from which}} sails are set. It may be {{constructed}} of timber or steel or from more modern materials like aluminium or carbon fibre. Although {{some types of}} fore and aft rigs have yards, the term is usually {{used to describe the}} horizontal spars used on <b>square</b> rigged <b>sails.</b> In addition, for some decades after <b>square</b> <b>sails</b> were generally dispensed with, some yards were retained for deploying wireless (radio) aerials and signal flags.|$|R
5000|$|... "Squaring a yard" [...] {{adjusts the}} {{position}} of the <b>square</b> <b>sails</b> so that they are perpendicular to the keel of the ship. This is done in order to [...] "run before the wind', i.e., sail with the wind directly behind the vessel rather than tacking.|$|R
2500|$|La Belle was a barque-longue, {{with three}} masts and a {{relatively}} shallow draft of about [...] [...] Her beam was officially 14ft 9inches, {{and she was}} 54ft 4inches long with a cargo capacity of 40–45 tons. [...] The ship {{was designed to be}} highly maneuverable, with the mainmast and foremast holding twosails each, while the mizzenmast supported a single triangular sail, and another small <b>square</b> <b>sail</b> hung from the bowsprit.|$|E
2500|$|A {{transition}} from galley to sailing vessels {{as the most}} common types of warships began in the high Middle Ages (c. 11th century). Large high-sided sailing ships had always been formidable obstacles for galleys. To low-freeboard oared vessels, the bulkier sailing ships, [...] the cog and the carrack, were almost like floating fortresses, being difficult to board and even harder to capture. Galleys remained useful as warships throughout the entire Middle Ages because of their maneuverability. Sailing ships of the time had only one mast, usually with just a single, large <b>square</b> <b>sail.</b> This made them cumbersome to steer and it was virtually impossible to sail into the wind direction. Galleys therefore were still the only ship type capable of coastal raiding and amphibious landings, both key elements of medieval warfare.|$|E
2500|$|Dennison J. Lawlor was {{a famous}} Boston Naval {{architect}} who produced a line plan in which the Sparrow-Hawk had two masts. The forward mast carried a single <b>square</b> <b>sail,</b> the mizzen mast (after mast) carried a lateen sail. It was decided by a 'Mr. Sanders' [...] to use Lawlor's plan but reduce the depth to about 8'. Common arcs of circles replaced the sheer line with [...] "lively rise" [...] at both ends. Paintings of small square stern ships of this period show an overhang aft, instead of a flat transom, with an outboard rudder as drawn by Lawlor. [...] Sander's rig {{takes into account the}} mast step, and thereby reduced the rig to two possibilities: 'simple' three masted; or the two-masted, square rig known in the 17th century ships as a Barque.|$|E
