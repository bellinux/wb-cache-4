From 1792, she found some relief from her worry about her husband by planning the gardens and decoration of a new residence for herself, Frogmore House, in Windsor Home Park.|$|E
25|$|In early 1929, Abbott visited New York City, {{ostensibly to}} find an American {{publisher}} for Atget's photographs. Upon seeing the city again, however, Abbott immediately saw its photographic potential. Accordingly, {{she went back to}} Paris, closed up her studio, and returned to New York in September. Her first photographs of the city were taken with a hand-held Kurt-Bentzin camera, but soon she acquired a Century Universal camera which produced 8 x 10inch negatives. Using this large format camera, Abbott photographed New York City with the diligence and attention to detail <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> admired in Eugène Atget. Her work has provided a historical chronicle of many now-destroyed buildings and neighborhoods of Manhattan.|$|E

Middleton {{said that he had}} kept his wife off the stage, that he [...] "didn't like the idea of musical comedy", but would not have objected to her appearance in [...] "grand opera". Nonetheless, he agreed to an offer from Max Dill. Michelena said that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> far spent her married life studying to perform three operatic roles: Carmen and Micaëla in Carmen, and Violetta Valéry in La traviata. She said that prior to appearing at the Garrick Theater, she had been afraid that her stage training had been lost.

500|$|In 1985, Ricky Vela joined Selena y Los Dinos {{as their}} keyboardist. Although Vela was {{attracted}} to the group's drummer, Suzette Quintanilla, he kept his feelings to himself. When he confessed his feelings to Suzette's brother, group manager Abraham Quintanilla, III, he began teasing him about it. After Suzette's September 1993 marriage, Vela wrote [...] "No Me Queda Más" [...] and {{it was given to}} Selena to record for Amor Prohibido. Selena's brother A.B. Quintanilla did not find the song to have any potential; he has said that he later had a change of heart. Although the song was originally intended as a mariachi track, EMI Latin president Jose Behar believed that a mariachi recording would not appeal to the popular market. The group gave it to Argentine arranger Bebu Silvetti to rework into a pop-style track, and Behar asked Silvetti to [...] "sweeten" [...] the song to boost its airplay and chart performance. The result enhanced Selena's pop-radio success. Behar said in a Billboard interview that the song was [...] "internalized" [...] without affecting the originality of its recording. In a 2002 interview, A.B. said that during a recording session he had asked Selena to record the song for a fifth time. The singer replied, [...] "What you got there is what you got" [...] and left to go shopping. He mused, [...] "Now looking back, she really did a beautiful job when recording the song, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much passion. The song became a classic." ...|$|E
500|$|Jacobs {{departed}} from Holby City in 2011, wanting to [...] "broaden [...] horizons" [...] {{after seven years}} in the programme. The thirteenth series saw the departure of many regular cast members, {{and the arrival of}} a group of new ones, including Guy Henry, Laila Rouass, and Jimmy Akingbola. Jacobs deemed it [...] "a new era with a new cast", one which she was not part of, and stated that the time felt right to leave. She had some input in her exit storyline, the focal point of which was Donna's relationship with Kieran, as they moved away to begin a new life together. Jacobs relayed feedback she had received from the general public with regards to how Donna should leave, and this was incorporated into her departure. The actress felt personal pressure to get Donna's last scenes right, wanting to give the best performance possible. She found the filming [...] "overwhelming", explaining [...] "it was incredibly emotional and intense, and it made it all very hard, and raw. [...] It wasn't until later that I realised I'd put myself under a hideously stressful situation, and that I should just be enjoying the experience." [...] She stated: [...] "I've absolutely loved playing Donna. I know that I'm going to look back very fondly on the time I had with her. I really got to know the character, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> many facets and was always fun to play." ...|$|E

In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Ciara said: [...] "It's all about showing another side of me with this video. I'm basically giving you a show you'd see in Vegas—and it's my love, sex and magic show. He's the voyeur and I play with him a little bit. I got my inspiration from the Crazy Horse show and just from the shows , period. It's giving you the elements of love and sex and magic." [...] In a later interview about the video, Ciara stated {{that she had to}} lick Timberlake's ear, and at one point, he was licking her neck and they were [...] "freestyling." [...] Martel wanted them to do something [...] "edgy," [...] so they found a [...] "cool way to do it." [...] Ciara noted the different pauses in cuts in between the tapings, commenting [...] "so it's licking on the neck, again, then his biting on my neck, again. It was really funny." [...] The singer would later elaborate on the Crazy Horse show reference in {{an interview with}} Blues & Soul, explaining that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much respect for the show that it became her reference. On working with Timberlake, she said, [...] "Justin {{is one of the most}} easy-going, down-to-earth, hard-working and passionate artists you could ever work with. And, with both me and him, our goal was just to make the best video we could possibly make together, and to give the fans something a little fun and a little unexpected." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was well}} known she disliked large parties. Peter Townsend said of her [...] "She possessed classic, serene good looks and sincerity shone from her mild face.

2500|$|During {{her time}} as a guard soldier, she {{preserved}} her male identity through her [...] "female cunning", but as the story goes, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> many troubles with sexual advances from {{both women and men}} that in the end she could see no other solution but to reveal her identity to the king himself before she was discovered in some other way. According to the legend, she stepped forward and fell down before the king one day when he passed a row of soldiers, of which she was one. She then revealed her identity to him.|$|E
2500|$|Behn {{may have}} had a Catholic upbringing. She once commented that she was [...] "designed for a nun," [...] and the fact that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> many Catholic connections, such as Henry Neville who was later arrested for his Catholicism, would have aroused suspicions during the anti-Catholic fervour of the 1680s. She was a monarchist, and her sympathy for the Stuarts, and {{particularly}} for the Catholic Duke of York may be demonstrated by her dedication of her play The Rover II to him after he had been exiled for the second time. Behn was dedicated to the restored King Charles II. As political parties emerged during this time, Behn became a Tory supporter.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the onset}} of World War II, Bergman [...] "felt guilty because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> misjudged the {{situation}} in Germany" [...] while she was there filming Die vier Gesellen (The Four Companions). According {{to one of her}} biographers, Charlotte Chandler (2007), she had at first considered the Nazis only a [...] "temporary aberration, 'too foolish to be taken seriously.' She believed Germany would not start a war." [...] Bergman felt that [...] "The good people there would not permit it." [...] Chandler adds, [...] "Ingrid felt guilty all {{the rest of her life}} because when she was in Germany at the end of the war, she had been afraid to go with the others to witness the atrocities of the Nazi extermination camps." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{was offered}} the {{starring}} role in a television mini-series, A Woman Called Golda (1982), about the late Israeli prime minister Golda Meir. It was to be her final acting role and she was honored posthumously with a second Emmy Award for Best Actress. [...] Her daughter, Isabella, described Bergman's surprise at being offered the part and the producer {{trying to explain to}} her, [...] "People believe you and trust you, and this is what I want, because Golda Meir had the trust of the people." [...] Isabella adds, [...] "Now that was interesting to Mother." [...] She was also persuaded that Golda was a [...] "grand-scale person," [...] one that people would assume was much taller than she actually was. Chandler notes that the role [...] "also had a special significance for her, as during World War II, Ingrid felt guilty because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> misjudged the situation in Germany." ...|$|E

[...] She [...] predicted that Buddhism would become extinct in Vietnam.

American journalists had discovered Madame Nhu was [...] "unfortunately too beautiful to ignore" [...] as a Kennedy administration staffer complained, and that it was easy to provoke her into saying something outrageous, causing a media circus to develop around her as she traveled across America.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difficulty}} {{of this argument}} for some compatibilists {{lies in the fact}} that it entails the impossibility that one could have chosen other than one has. For example, if Jane is a compatibilist and she has just sat down on the sofa, then she is committed to the claim that she could have remained standing, if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> desired. But it follows from the consequence argument that, if Jane had remained standing, she would have either generated a contradiction, violated the laws of nature or changed the past. Hence, compatibilists are committed to the existence of [...] "incredible abilities", according to Ginet and van Inwagen. One response to this argument is that it equivocates on the notions of abilities and necessities, or that the free will evoked to make any given choice is really an illusion and the choice had been made all along, oblivious to its [...] "decider". David Lewis suggests that compatibilists are only committed to the ability to do something otherwise if different circumstances had actually obtained in the past.|$|E
2500|$|Unite took {{shelter from}} a gale between 28 and 31 July under Lusin on the Dalmatian coast. Late in the {{afternoon}} of the 31st, near Premuda, she sighted three enemy naval brigs. Captain Campbell set out in chase and around 3am found himself with in two miles of two of the brigs. Suddenly he sighted he saw the third; Unite steered to pass by the third and while within pistol-shot, gave the brig a broadside, which caused the brig to surrender without a shot being fired, her crew having taken refuge below decks. Unite sent boats that secured the brig and then set out after her two companions. There was little wind so the brigs made use of their sweeps and it was only around 7a.m. that Unite was able {{to catch up with the}} larger, and more laggardly of the brigs. This vessel, seeing no chance to escape, fired a broadside, struck her colours, and ran onto the shore, where Unite took possession. The third brig escaped. The two captured brigs turned out to be Nettuno and Teulié, both of sixteen [...] "Thirty-Two-Pounders, Brass Carronades", and 115 men each. The brigs had been sent to find and take Unite, the French having heard that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> many men sick that she would be easy prey. Although Unite had no casualties, the two French brigs were less fortunate. Nettuno had seven men killed, two drowned, and 13 wounded; Teuliè had five men killed and 16 wounded.|$|E
