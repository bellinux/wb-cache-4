5|$|The <b>Sprain</b> Brook Parkway, {{designated}} by the New York State Department of Transportation as NY987F, a state reference route, begins at a fork from the Bronx River Parkway along the latter's right-of-way along the Bronx River {{in the city of}} Yonkers. Crossing through the Northeast Yonkers neighborhood as a six-lane freeway design, the <b>Sprain</b> Brook crosses an interchange with NY100 (Central Park Avenue) south of Andrus Park. Bending to the north through Yonkers, the <b>Sprain</b> Brook reaches an interchange with Tuckahoe Road, with the northbound and southbound lanes splitting around the Grassy <b>Sprain</b> Reservoir. The two directions bend northeast along the reservoir. The southbound lanes cross <b>Sprain</b> Ridge Park, while the northbound lanes cross through a golf course. Leaving Yonkers for the town of Greenburgh, the lanes of the <b>Sprain</b> Brook come back together, reaching an interchange with Jackson Avenue. The six lane parkway continues northward and to the northeast through Greenburgh, crossing under Ardsley Road. After turning northward once again, the <b>Sprain</b> Brook crosses under a former alignment of NY131 (Underhill Road) and passes by the Sunningdale Country Club.|$|E
5|$|Continuing its north/northeast winding, the <b>Sprain</b> Brook enters an {{interchange}} with NY100B (Dobbs Ferry Road), {{passing by}} East Rumbrook Park. Crossing over NY119 in Elmsford, the parkway enters an interchange with Interstate 287 (the Cross Westchester Expressway). After crossing through the interchange, the Spain continues northward as a six-lane parkway {{back through the}} town of Greenburgh, entering an interchange with NY100C (Grasslands Road). Paralleling NY100 to the west, the parkway, bending northward into Mount Pleasant and an interchange with County Route301 (Bradhurst Entrance North Road), which connects to NY100 (Bradhurst Avenue). North of that junction, the southbound lanes of the <b>Sprain</b> Brook interchange with a crossing NY100. After several bends to the north, the <b>Sprain</b> Brook enters the merging Taconic State Parkway and terminates as the right-of-way continues as the Taconic.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Sprain</b> Brook {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the early 1920s as a parkway between the Bronx River Parkway and the Hawthorne Circle. The parkway sold a majority of its right-of-way in the 1920s, but the proposed parkway met strong opposition {{from the village of}} Bronxville and Yonkers. The <b>Sprain</b> Brook proposal sat on the table until 1949, when the State Council of Parks, run by Robert Moses, sought to ease congestion on the Bronx River Parkway. Moses proposed that a new state park would be constructed in Westchester, with the <b>Sprain</b> Brook Parkway serving as a traffic alternative to the Bronx River, and nearly {{a decade and a half}} after the parkway was deeded land. This time, Bronxville opposed the project rather than Yonkers, but an agreement was worked out in 1951. This new alignment would bypass the parts of Bronxville and Yonkers to construct the freeway.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Sprain</b> Brook Parkway sees {{an average}} of 95,442 {{vehicles}} per day throughout its entire length. The stretch between I-287 and NY100C sees the highest amount, with 101,460 cars in a 2011 report. The stretch between NY100 in Yonkers and Jackson Avenue in Greenburgh sees the second-highest, at 100,900, which is an upgrade of over 19,000 vehicles since the same report in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Torn muscles, knee injuries, and {{headaches}} {{are common}} ailments which {{may result from}} yoga practice. In one 2016 survey over 13 years conducted in the United States, there were 29,590 yoga-related injuries reported from hospital emergency rooms, with trunk <b>sprain</b> injuries as the most frequent region injured, and an injury rate highest in participants 65 years and older.|$|E
50|$|There {{are certain}} factors which {{increase}} risk of <b>sprains.</b> Fatigue of muscles generally leads to <b>sprains.</b> When one suddenly starts to exercise after a sedentary lifestyle, <b>sprains</b> are quite common.While scientific studies are lacking, {{it is often}} thought that not warming-up is a common cause of <b>sprains</b> in athletes. Warming-up is thought to loosen the joint, increases blood flow and makes the joint more flexible.|$|R
5000|$|In a study {{comparing}} {{the prevalence of}} ankle <b>sprains</b> between age, race, and sex, individuals who were aged 10-19 years old had highest incidences of ankle <b>sprains.</b> It can be suggested that adolescents are more physically active, which leads to higher chances of ankle <b>sprains.</b> Since sports deal with high utilization of the ankle, over 50% of ankle <b>sprains</b> are due to sport related injuries.|$|R
30|$|Despite {{the common}} {{occurrence}} of ankle <b>sprains,</b> no treatment {{is considered to}} be the gold standard for the management of such <b>sprains.</b> We assessed functional treatment versus plaster of Paris (POP) for the treatment of lateral ankle <b>sprains,</b> with pain and function employed as the outcome measures.|$|R

40|$|Roughly 85 % of all acute ankle {{injuries}} are <b>sprains,</b> of which about 85 % are uncomplicated, involving the lateral ligaments only. Roughly 85 % of all acute ankle {{injuries are}} <b>sprains,</b> 1 of which about 85 % are uncomplicated, involving the lateral ligaments only. 2 The anterior talofibular ligament {{is the most}} susceptible to injury followed by the calcaneofibular ligament. A grading system based {{on the level of}} injury to 1 or more ligaments is often used to describe lateral ankle <b>sprains.</b> The anterior drawer and talar tilt tests, which determine clinical instability, are also emphasized in the evaluation of ankle <b>sprains.</b> However, neither the grade of the injury nor the results of instability tests influence the treatment program. 3 Studies have shown that the occurrence and persistence of soft tissue swelling and the associated loss of pain-free range of motion and strength in <b>sprained</b> ankles delay the patient's return to full activities more than any other factor. 3 Thus, the prevention or elimination of soft tissue swelling is paramount in the management of lateral ankle <b>sprains.</b> Evidence also shows that recurrence of lateral ankle <b>sprains</b> is high when the patient does not do the following...|$|R
40|$|Ankle {{injuries}} {{have always}} posed an issue {{to a number}} of athletes. Sports that involve running and jumping accumulate about 25 % of injuries correlating to ankle <b>sprains.</b> In most ankle <b>sprains</b> the inversion (supination) of the ankle cause damage to lateral ligaments. The two most common lateral ligaments to experience damage are the anterior talofibular (ATFL) and calcaneofibular (CFL) ligaments. The methods of taping and ankle braces have allowed athletes to prevent recurring <b>sprains</b> from occurring. However, <b>sprains</b> can still occur even when one or both methods are applied. The purpose of each method is to restrict the range of motion of the foot, but none have proposed a dynamic approach to <b>sprains.</b> The mechanism behind supination ankle <b>sprains</b> have been evaluated for four decades, but still no mathematical model have been produced due to the complexity of the subtalar joint. The purpose of this project is to determine if a compressive force to the ATFL and CFL would increase the stability of the foot and ankle. In the process of determining a solution to this problem, a simplified static equilibrium equation was created to better understand the mechanism behind supination ankle <b>sprains</b> in a closed kinetic chain motion. However, <b>sprains</b> involve both closed and open kinetic chain motions of the subtalar joint. The mathematical model presented in this project suggests that a moment in the direction of eversion can provide a dynamic approach to preventing <b>sprains,</b> but further validation is required due to the inconsistency of the values gathered from various studies and limitations of the model...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to record the <b>sprains</b> that {{occurred}} in students of the Athletic Facilitation Classes (AFC). The study was carried out at National Level from September 2006 to May 2007. During this period, 7455 male and 4921 female student-athletes were in close supervision of the researchers. The data were recorded by the physical education teachers of the AFC were registered in SPSS and they were analyzed with χ 2 non-parametric test. During the study 248 <b>sprains</b> were recorded (21. 9 %, χ 2 = 40. 3, df = 17, p< 0. 05). One hundred and forty <b>sprains</b> (56. 5 %) occurred in the male and one hundred and eight (108) (43. 5 %) in female student-athletes (p< 0. 001). The rate of <b>sprains</b> was 1. 88 per male per year and 2. 52 per female student-athlete per year. Most <b>sprains</b> were recorded in the male than in female student-athletes that attended in AFC, which functioned in the capital of prefectures (68. 1 vs. 31. 9, χ 2 = 12. 0, df = 1, p< 0. 001). A significant number of <b>sprains</b> occurred during the months of November, December, January, February and March, while the sports in which most <b>sprains</b> occurred were basketball, volleyball and football. The training surface on which most <b>sprains</b> occurred was the parquet and the synthetic floor.

40|$|Ankle <b>sprains</b> {{are among}} the most common {{musculoskeletal}} injuries. The vast majority of these injuries are lateral ligament <b>sprains,</b> resulting from inversion of the plantar-flexed foot. Initial management should include rest, ice, compression and elevation.

Surgical management of acute ankle <b>sprains</b> is rarely, if ever, indicated. Patients who continue to sustain multiple recurrent inversion <b>sprains</b> despite a supervised rehabilitation program aimed at improving proprioception and strengthening of the peroneal muscles are candidate for surgical reconstruction of the lateral ankle ligaments.

40|$|Ankle <b>sprains</b> are {{the most}} common {{injuries}} among athletes. Often times, the lateral ankle ligaments are the main focus of clinical evaluation. Assessment of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis can often be missed or ignored. Consequently, syndesmosis injuries have been underdiagnosed. Differentiating lateral ankle <b>sprains</b> from syndesmotic injuries can sometimes be difficult. The proper diagnosis and management of tibiofibular syndesmosis <b>sprains</b> (high ankle <b>sprains)</b> can become challenging when determining the extent of injury, expected time of recovery, and the best treatment approach for the athlete. Methods: This was a literature review discussing the anatomical content of the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis, the mechanism of injury for syndesmosis <b>sprains,</b> the incidence of such injuries, and the diagnosis and treatment Results: From the literature available, the authors found that anatomically, {{there was no significant difference}} between the AITFL and PITFL in strength or stiffness. They found that classically, the mechanism of injury involves the ankle externally rotating with the foot dorsiflexed and pronated. However, some studies show that syndesmotic injuries do occur with inversion <b>sprains.</b> The incidence of syndesmosis <b>sprains</b> reported among their review showed about 75 % of these injuries occurred during football, lacrosse, hockey, and rugby, whereas the incidence among the general athletic population was only 10...|$|R

40|$|Syndesmosis <b>sprains,</b> or “high ankle <b>sprains,</b> ” {{present a}} signif-icant {{treatment}} challenge, especially for in-season athletes. Several {{studies have demonstrated}} that syndesmosis <b>sprains</b> are associated with prolonged disability and recovery time. 1, 4, 5, 15, 17 Recent work has suggested that injury to the syndesmotic ligaments can occur in association with both medial and lateral ankle ligament injuries. 14 Additionally, investigators have found that syndesmosis <b>sprains</b> occur more frequently than originally reported, with the increase perhaps due to an increased awareness. 4 Grade III syndesmosis <b>sprains</b> are particularly trouble-some injuries. Grade III injuries are defined by widening of the ankle mortise on radiographs, with or without external rotation stress. Frequently, these grade III syndesmosis <b>sprains</b> are associated with a deltoid ligament injury. Treatment methods for these injuries usually include internal fixation of the syndesmosis, 2, 8 although variables in operative treatment such as the number of screws to use, whether to include ligament repair with the internal fixation, the need for postoperative immobilization, post-operative weightbearing status, and the timing of hard-ware removal remain in question. 2, 8, 9, 1...|$|R
