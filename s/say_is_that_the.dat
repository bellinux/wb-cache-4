[...] Androzani.com said of the episode, [...] "It's awful. It's horrific.

[...] Seb Patrick of Noise to Signal thought, [...] "despite a strong - and {{somewhat}} morally ambiguous - ending [...] really should have delivered in more spectacular fashion than this." [...] Patrick also criticised Jack's personality throughout the episode, stating [...] "we wanted a spinoff series about him because he was cocky, cool and downright entertaining - Buzz Lightyear meets Ace Rimmer meets James Bond. We didn't want some grumpy immortal bastard with a chip on his shoulder." [...] Despite the mixed reviews however, the series producers and BBC controller of fiction Jane Tranter regard the episode as one of their favourites from the first series.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the failed coup, Diệm blamed Durbrow for a {{perceived}} lack of US support, while his brother Nhu further accused the ambassador of colluding with the rebels. Durbrow denied this in later years, saying that he had been [...] "100% in support of Diệm". In January 1961, Diệm told Kahin of his belief the US had been involved, while Nhu told Karnow [...] "the principal culprits in the revolt were the 'western embassies' and individual Americans in particular ... American military advisers were helping the paratroopers during the revolt." [...] In May 1961, Nhu said [...] "he least you can <b>say</b> ... <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> State Department was neutral between a friendly government and rebels who tried to put that government down ... and the official attitude of the Americans during that coup was not at all the attitude the President would have expected". For Diệm, that Durbrow had called for restraint was an indication he saw Diệm and the rebels as equals, something Diệm saw as anathema. Durbrow called for Diệm to treat the remaining rebel leaders leniently, stressing the need for Diệm to [...] "unify all elements of the country", but Diệm was adamantly opposed to this, angrily rebuffing the ambassador, saying [...] "You apparently do not understand that the rebels caused much blood-letting", accusing them having [...] "duped" [...] innocent people. Diệm also sent Gene Gregory, an American supporter who edited the Times of Vietnaman English-language newspaper operated as a mouthpiece for the Nhus and known for stridently attacking Ngô family opponentsto meet Durbrow with concrete evidence of [...] "American support of and complicity in the coup". From the coup onwards, Diệm became increasingly suspicious of Washington's policies. He was also angry with US media coverage of the coup, which depicted Diệm as authoritarian and the revolt as a manifestation of widespread discontent. Diệm instead viewed opposition simply as troublemakers.|$|E

2500|$|For filmmakers to {{do justice}} to the biblical {{accounts}} of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism.

Rabbi Daniel Lapin, the head of the Toward Tradition organization, criticized this statement, and said of Abraham Foxman, the head of the ADL, [...] "what he <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only way to escape the wrath of Foxman is to repudiate your faith".|$|R
