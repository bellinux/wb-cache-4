Due {{to the fact that}} an RNA primer is required for initiation of DNA synthesis, the lagging strand is at a disadvantage in replicating the entire chromosome.

50|$|Nucleotide {{excision}} repair (NER) {{is a particularly}} important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts - these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts.

The undamaged single-stranded DNA remains and DNA polymerase uses it as a template to synthesize a short complementary sequence.

40|$|Genetic {{recombination}} in bacteria is {{facilitated by}} the RecA strand transfer protein and strongly depends on the homology between interacting sequences. RecA-independent recombination is detectable but occurs at extremely low frequencies and is less responsive {{to the extent of}} homology. In this article, we show that RecA-independent recombination in Escherichia coli is depressed by the redundant action of single-strand exonucleases. In the absence of multiple single-strand exonucleases, the efficiency of RecA-independent recombination events, involving either gene conversion or crossing-over, is markedly increased to levels rivaling RecA-dependent events. This finding suggests that RecA-independent recombination is not intrinsically inefficient but is limited by <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> substrate availability. Crossing-over is inhibited by exonucleases ExoI, ExoVII, ExoX, and RecJ, whereas only ExoI and RecJ abort gene-conversion events. In ExoI− RecJ− strains, gene conversion can be accomplished by transformation of <b>short</b> <b>single-strand</b> <b>DNA</b> oligonucleotides and is more efficient when the oligonucleotide is complementary to the lagging-strand replication template. We propose that E. coli encodes an unknown mechanism for RecA-independent recombination (independent of prophage recombination systems) that is targeted to replication forks. The potential of RecA-independent recombination to mediate exchange at short homologies suggests that it may contribute significantly to genomic change in bacteria, especially in species with reduced cellular exonuclease activity or those that encode DNA protection factors...|$|R
50|$|Several {{different}} <b>short</b> <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules (oligonucleotides) {{are used}} in a branched DNA-assay. The capture and capture-extender oligonucleotide bind to the target nucleic acid and immobilize it on a solid support. The label oligonucleotide and the branched DNA then detects the immobilized target nucleic acid. The immobilization of the target on a solid support makes extensive washing easier, which reduces false positive results. After binding of the target to the solid support it can be detected by branched DNA which is coupled to an enzyme (e.g. alkaline phosphatase). The branched DNA binds to the sample nucleic acid by specific hybridization in areas which are not occupied by capture hybrids. The branching of the DNA allows for very dense decorating of the DNA with the enzyme, which {{is important for the}} high sensitivity of the assay. The enzyme catalyzes a reaction of a substrate which generates light (detectable in a luminometer). The amount of light emitted increases with the amount of the specific nucleic acid present in the sample. The design of the branched DNA and the way it is hybridized to the nucleic acid to be investigated differs between different generations of the bDNA assay.Despite the fact that the starting material is not preamplified, bDNA assays can detect less than 100 copies of HIV-RNA per mL of blood.|$|E

30|$|Besides {{mitochondrial}} DNAs, {{recognition of}} self-genomic DNAs by cGAS causes autoimmune diseases. TREX 1 is a cytoplasmic exonuclease that degrades DNA either from self or engulfment (Crow et al., 2006; Morita et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2007). During DNA repair of damages caused by endogenous or environmental stresses, <b>short</b> <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNAs</b> are continuously generated (Lindahl and Wood, 1999). These <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNAs</b> leak {{out to the}} cytoplasm, where they are drawn back into the nucleus by DNA repair and replication factors such as RPA and Rad 51 (Wolf et al., 2016). RPA or Rad 51 knockdown causes accumulation of <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNAs</b> in the cytosol. TREX 1 is anchored on the outer nuclear membrane to degrade leaking DNAs immediately. RPA or Rad 51 inhibition leaves more DNAs in the cytosol than TREX 1 can degrade. Similarly, TREX 1 deficiency exhausts the DNA-drawing role of RPA and Rad 51, resulting in accumulation of DNAs in the cytoplasm. In TREX 1 deficient mice, accumulated self-DNAs activate cGAS for cGAMP production, followed by type I IFN and inflammatory cytokine production (Ablasser et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2015; Gray et al., 2015). Persistent cytokine production leads to autoimmune diseases in the host. A further knockout of cGAS in the TREX 1 deficient mice reduces type I IFN and cytokine production, alleviating the autoimmune symptoms. Selective inhibition of the cGAS-mediated DNA sensing pathway sheds new lights on therapies of autoimmune diseases.|$|R

Interestingly, iron (III) -protoporphyrin (hemin) {{was a good}} competitive inhibitor for the DNA-catalyzed metallation reaction, and appeared to bind strongly to the NMM-binding DNA aptamers. We investigated the peroxidase activity of the aptamer-hemin complexes {{to see if the}} DNA component of the complex, like the apoenzymes in protein peroxidases, could enhance the low intrinsic peroxidatic activity of hemin. Results: Two porphyrin-bind ing DNA aptamers bound hemin with submicromolar affinity. The aptamer-hemin complexes had significantly higher peroxidase activity than hemin alone, under physiological conditions. The Vobs of the PS 2. M-hemin complex was 250 times greater than that of hemin alone, and significantly superior to a previously reported hemin—catalytic-antibody complex. Preliminary spectroscopic evidence suggests the coordination of the hemin iron in the complex changes, such that the complex more closely resembles horseradish peroxidase and other heme proteins rather than hemin. Conclusions: A new class of catalytic activity for nucleic acids is reported. The aptamer-hemin complexes described are novel DNA enzymes and their study will help elucidate the structural and functional requirements of peroxidase enzymes in general and the ways that a nucleic acid ‘apoenzyme’ might work to enhance the intrinsic peroxidatic ability of hemin.

Our results indicate that the conformational stability of the ssDNA is dependent on the thermodynamic conditions. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
30|$|Nanopores {{have been}} proven to be novel and {{versatile}} single-molecule sensors for individual unlabeled biopolymer detection and characterization. In the present study, a relatively large silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) nanopore with a diameter of approximately 60  nm was fabricated successfully using a focused Ga ion beam (FIB). We demonstrated a simple ex situ silanization procedure to control the size and functionality of solid-state nanopores. The presented results show that by varying the silanization time, {{it is possible to}} adjust the efficiency of probe molecule attachment, thus shrinking the pore to the chosen size, while introducing selective sensing probes. The functionalization of nanopores was verified by analysis of field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and electrical measurements. Based on this study, we envision that the functionalized silicon nitride nanopores with the DNA probe might provide a biosensing platform for the detection and discrimination of a <b>short</b> <b>single-stranded</b> <b>DNA</b> oligomer of unknown sequences in the future.|$|E
40|$|Oligonucleotides are <b>short,</b> <b>single-stranded</b> {{fragments}} of <b>DNA</b> or RNA, designed to readily bind {{with a unique}} part in the target sequence. They have many important applications including PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification, microarrays, or FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) probes. While traditional microarrays are commonly used for measuring gene expression levels by probing for sequences of known and predicted genes, high-density, whole genome tiling arrays probe intensively for sequences that are known to exist in a contiguous region. Current programs for designing oligonucleotides for tiling arrays {{are not able to}} produce results that are close to optimal since they allow oligonucleotides that are too similar with non-targets, thus enabling unwanted cross-hybridization. We present a new program, BOND-tile, that produces much better tiling arrays, as shown by extensive comparison with leading programs...|$|R
40|$|DNA is {{increasingly}} {{being used as}} the engineering material of choice {{for the construction of}} nanoscale circuits, structures, and motors. Many of these enzyme-free constructions function by DNA strand displacement reactions. The kinetics of strand displacement can be modulated by toeholds, <b>short</b> <b>single-stranded</b> segments of <b>DNA</b> that colocalize reactant DNA molecules. Recently, the toehold exchange process was introduced as a method for designing fast and reversible strand displacement reactions. Here, we characterize the kinetics of DNA toehold exchange and model it as a three-step process. This model is simple and quantitatively predicts the kinetics of 85 different strand displacement reactions from the DNA sequences. Furthermore, we use toehold exchange to construct a simple catalytic reaction. This work improves the understanding of the kinetics of nucleic acid reactions and will be useful in the rational design of dynamic DNA and RNA circuits and nanodevices...|$|R
30|$|Aptamers are <b>short,</b> <b>single-stranded</b> RNA or <b>DNA</b> oligonucleotides (15 – 40 bases) {{that can}} bind to target {{molecules}} with high affinity and specificity due {{to the ability of}} the molecules to fold into unique conformations with three-dimensional (3 D) structures. A large number of aptamers have been screened against aberrantly activated proteins in cancer cells, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells. Specific aptamers for targets can be selected from a large number of random sequences (libraries of 1015 random oligonucleotides) via the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) [39]. Aptamers generally have less immunogenicity, which can lead to improved biodistribution in the human body. NP surfaces can easily be conjugated with aptamers, and the conjugates show efficient cancer cell targeting and internalization [40]. Small molecules, peptides and aptamers are preferred for targeting and imaging ligands because they can be simply conjugated to NPs via facile chemical conjugation methods.|$|R
