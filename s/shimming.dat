25|$|To achieve proper {{intonation}} {{and sound}} quality, each string of a hurdy-gurdy must be wrapped with cotton or similar fibers. The cotton on melody strings {{tends to be}} quite light, while drone strings have heavier cotton. Improper cottoning results in a raspy tone, especially at higher pitches. In addition, individual strings (in particular the melody strings) often have to have their height above the wheel surface adjusted by having small pieces of paper placed between the strings and the bridge, a process called <b>shimming.</b> <b>Shimming</b> and cottoning are connected processes since either one can affect the geometry of the instrument's strings.|$|E
25|$|Using {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) to image the human OFC is a challenge, because this brain region is in proximity to the air-filled sinuses. This means that signal dropout, geometric distortion and susceptibility artifacts are common when using EPI at higher magnetic field strengths. Extra care is therefore recommended for obtaining a good signal from the orbitofrontal cortex, and a number of strategies have been devised, such as automatic <b>shimming</b> at high static magnetic field strengths.|$|E
25|$|Jointed rails {{were used}} {{at first because}} {{contemporary}} technology did not offer any alternative. However, the intrinsic weakness in resisting vertical loading results in the ballast becoming depressed and a heavy maintenance workload is imposed to prevent unacceptable geometrical defects at the joints. The joints also needed to be lubricated, and wear at the fishplate (joint bar) mating surfaces needed to be rectified by <b>shimming.</b> For this reason jointed track is not financially appropriate for heavily operated railroads.|$|E

25|$|Distortion {{corrections}} {{account for}} field nonuniformities of the scanner. One method, as described before, {{is to use}} <b>shimming</b> coils. Another is to recreate a field map of the main field by acquiring two images with differing echo times. If the field were uniform, {{the differences between the}} two images also would be uniform. Note these are not true preprocessing techniques since they are independent of the study itself. Bias field estimation is a real preprocessing technique using mathematical models of the noise from distortion, such as Markov random fields and expectation maximization algorithms, to correct for distortion.|$|E
25|$|System {{noise is}} from the imaging hardware. One form is scanner drift, caused by the superconducting magnet's field {{drifting}} over time. Another form is changes in the current or voltage distribution of the brain itself inducing changes in the receiver coil and reducing its sensitivity. A procedure called impedance matching is used to bypass this inductance effect. There could also be noise from the magnetic field not being uniform. This is often adjusted for by using <b>shimming</b> coils, small magnets physically inserted, say into the subject's mouth, to patch the magnetic field. The nonuniformities are often near brain sinuses such as the ear and plugging the cavity for long periods can be discomfiting. The scanning process acquires the MR signal in k-space, in which overlapping spatial frequencies (that is repeated edges in the sample's volume) are each represented with lines. Transforming this into voxels introduces some loss and distortions.|$|E

2500|$|To {{detect the}} very small {{frequency}} shifts due to nuclear magnetic resonance, the applied magnetic field must be constant throughout the sample volume. High resolution NMR spectrometers use shims to adjust the homogeneity of the magnetic field to parts per billion (ppb) in a volume of a few cubic centimeters. In order to detect and compensate for inhomogeneity and drift in the magnetic field, the spectrometer maintains a [...] "lock" [...] on the solvent deuterium frequency with a separate lock unit.

Difference-based detection was used by Russinovich's RootkitRevealer tool to find the Sony DRM rootkit.|$|E

5000|$|In nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy, [...] "shimming an NMR magnet" [...] is a procedure to generate homogeneous magnetic field along the sample volume to obtain pure Lorentzian line shapes of various resonances in the spectrum. This is accomplished by manual <b>shimming</b> of individual shims, or automatic <b>shimming</b> procedure.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, the {{magnetic}} field inside an NMR spectrometer or MRI scanner will be far from homogeneous compared with an [...] "ideal" [...] field of the device. This {{is a result of}} production tolerances and of {{the magnetic}} field of the environment. Iron constructions in walls and floor of the examination room become magnetized and disturb the field of the scanner. The probe and the sample or the patient become slightly magnetized when brought into the strong magnetic field and create additional inhomogeneous fields. The process of correcting for these inhomogeneities is called <b>shimming</b> the magnet, <b>shimming</b> the probe or <b>shimming</b> the sample, depending on the assumed source of the remaining inhomogeneity.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of shimming: active and passive.Active <b>shimming</b> uses coils with {{adjustable}} current. Passive <b>shimming</b> involves pieces of steel with good magnetic qualities. The steel pieces are placed near the permanent or superconducting magnet.
