50|$|While in Nouméa, the S-31 {{became the}} first American {{submarine}} to be equipped with a plan <b>position</b> <b>indicator,</b> or PPI. Originally intended for Admiral Halsey's flagship, the USS South Dakota, crewmen from the S-31 appropriated the plan <b>position</b> <b>indicator</b> for their own use. The plan <b>position</b> <b>indicator</b> proved remarkably useful during her eighth war patrol.|$|R

40|$|This R package {{provides}} to sociologists (and related scientists) a toolbox {{to facilitate}} the construction of social <b>position</b> <b>indicators</b> from survey data. Social <b>position</b> <b>indicators</b> refer to what {{is commonly known as}} social class and social status. There exists in the sociological literature many theoretical conceptualisation and empirical operationalization of social class and social status. This first version of the package offers tools to construct the International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI) and the Oesch social class schema. It also provides tools to convert several occupational classifications (PCS 82, PCS 03, and ISCO 08) into a common one (ISCO 88) to facilitate data harmonisation work, and tools to collapse (i. e. group) modalities of social <b>position</b> <b>indicators...</b>|$|R
