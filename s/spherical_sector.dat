This means that the line {{of sight of the}} observer, that was directed {{to the center of the}} object in its first position, now has to be directed to the center of the object in the second position. As the projection plane should always be perpendicular to the line of sight, it should turn along with it, and thus the object would appear exactly as in the first position. Now, even if the object would not keep its face towards the observer but the observer´s line of sight would follow it, the object would appear rotated but still with minimal projection distortion (provided that the projection plane was also rotated). The difference between the images of the same object produced by [...] "artificial" [...] perspective projection and by [...] "natural" [...] perspective projection is called [...] "perspective distortion." [...] It should be noted that both [...] "artificial" [...] and [...] "natural" [...] projection (the image beheld by the eye) foreshorten real objects and that parallel lines appear to intersect, so that is not the difference between them. The distortion is produced by the difference between the concave retina and the flat projection plane.

The enhancement of the line peak intensity from the edge-on to the pole-on positions is found to depend on the density, stratification, ionization, and electron temperature weighting.

It {{is based on a}} spherical shell divided into four triangular sectors according to the central projection of tetrahedron onto the surface of the unit sphere. Each sector is individually controlled to be heated above the ambient temperature independently of the wind velocity and incidence angle. A convection heat rate model of four hot spherical triangles under forced wind has been built with finite element method thermal-fluidic simulations. The angular sensitivity of the tetrahedral sphere structure has been theoretically determined and compared with the tessellation of the sphere by four biangles.

40|$|A {{previous}} study by Mikolajewicz {{suggested that the}} wind stress feedback stabilizes the Atlantic ther-mohaline circulation. This result was obtained under modern climate conditions, for which {{the presence of the}} massive continental ice sheets characteristic of glacial times is missing. Here a coupled ocean– atmosphere–sea ice model of intermediate complexity, set up in an idealized <b>spherical</b> <b>sector</b> geometry of the Atlantic basin, is used to show that, under glacial climate conditions, wind stress feedback actually reduces the stability of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC). The analysis reveals that the influ-ence of the wind stress feedback on the glacial MOC response to an external source of freshwater applied at high northern latitudes is controlled by the following two distinct processes: 1) the interactions between the wind field and the sea ice export in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), and 2) the northward Ekman transport in the tropics and upward Ekman pumping in the core of the NH subpolar gyre. The former dominates the response of the coupled system; it delays the recovery of the MOC, and in some cases even stabilizes collapsed MOC states achieved during the hosing period. The latter plays a minor role and mitigates the impact of the former process by reducing the upper-ocean freshening in deep-water formation regions. Hence, the wind stress feedback delays the recovery of the glacial MOC, which is the opposite o...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{an inverse}} source {{reconstruction}} method with great potential in radome diagnostics is presented. A radome is a cover that encloses an antenna {{in order to}} protect it from environmental influences. Radome diagnostics are acquired in the design process, the delivery control, and in performance verification of repaired and newly developed radomes. A measured near or far field may indicate deviations, e. g., beam deflection, but the origins of the flaws are not uncovered. In this thesis, radome diagnostics is performed by imaging the tangential electromagnetic fields on radome surfaces, disclosing the radome influence on the electromagnetic fields as well as the positions and influences of defects. The source reconstruction is based on a surface integral representation together with the extinction theorem. The extinction theorem and its associated surface integral equation ensure that the reconstructed tangential electromagnetic fields have their sources within the radome. The presence of axial symmetry in the measurement set-up enables usage of the fast Fourier transform to reduce the computational complexity. Furthermore, the problem is solved by an in-house body of revolution method of moments (MoM) code utilizing a singular value decomposition (SVD) for regularization. The reconstruction is performed on a fictitious surface in free space, located precisely outside the physical surface of the radome, i. e., no a priori information of the material of the radome is requested. Moreover, both synthetic and measured data are used to verify the method. In Papers I-III, the measurement set-up is a reflector antenna covered by a monolithic radome, and the near field is measured on a cylindrical surface. The height of the radome corresponds to 29 - 43 wavelengths in the frequency interval 8. 0 - 12. 0 GHz. The amplitude and phase of the tangential electromagnetic fields are reconstructed on the radome surface and the influence of the radome is investigated. Moreover, the alteration of the phase due to the transmission of the radome, the insertion phase delay (IPD), is imaged. Defects in the form of square copper patches, with an edge length corresponding to 1. 6 - 2. 4 wavelengths in the considered frequency interval, are attached to the radome wall. These might {{serve as a model for}} e. g., a lightning conductor or a Pitot tube. The attached patches alter the near field, and by applying source reconstruction, the disturbances of the patches are focused and detectable. In Paper IV, the field is measured on a <b>spherical</b> <b>sector</b> in the far-field region at 10. 0 GHz. Two set-ups with dielectric defects attached to the radome surface, are investigated. The aim is to investigate if variations in the electrical thickness of the radome wall can be detected. It is concluded that it is possible to discover dielectric patches of various edge sizes (0. 5 - 2. 0 wavelengths), and with the smallest thickness corresponding to a phase shift of a couple of degrees. In Paper V, a frequency selective (FSS) radome corresponding to a height of 51 wavelengths at the frequency 9. 35 GHz is investigated. The electrical performance of an FSS radome depends on the periodic structure of the elements in the radome frame. The periodic structure of the investigated radome is disrupted by horizontal defects (vertical displacements of elements) and vertical defects (a column of missing elements). The far-field data is measured on a <b>spherical</b> <b>sector,</b> and the far-field data reveals that the radome changes the radiation properties. The tangential electromagnetic fields on the radome surface are reconstructed for several antenna illuminations to image the cause of these alterations. Furthermore, it is shown that the different components of the electromagnetic fields are affected differently by the defects, implying that both co- and cross-components of the electric and magnetic fields need to be considered. Moreover, the Poynting's vector is employed to visualize how the defects block the field from the antenna...|$|E
