2500|$|Neo-Pagan antiquities {{researcher}} Timothy Zell and {{his wife}} Morning Glory also produced artificial unicorns dubbed [...] "the Living Unicorn", remodelling the [...] "horn buds" [...] of goat kids {{in such a way}} that their horns grew together into a single one. Zell theorized that this process might have been used in the past to create court curiosities and natural herd leaders, because the goat was able to use this long <b>straight</b> <b>horn</b> effectively as a weapon and a tool. Medieval art often depicts unicorns as small, with cloven hooves and beards, sometimes resembling goats more than horses with horns. This process is possible only with animals that naturally have horns. For a time, a few of these unicorns travelled with the Ringling Brothers Circus.|$|E
60|$|The whale {{has three}} bitter enemies, much smaller, but much bolder than himself, and of these he is terribly afraid. They are the swordfish, the thrasher, and the killer. The first of these, the swordfish, {{has a strong}} <b>straight</b> <b>horn</b> or sword {{projecting}} from his snout, with which he boldly attacks and pierces the whale. The thrasher is a strong fish, twenty feet long, and of great weight. Its method of attack is to leap {{out of the water}} on the whale's back, and deal it a tremendous blow with its powerful tail.|$|E

50|$|After Al-Biruni, Persian {{scholars}} {{took his}} description and formed ever more fanciful {{versions of the}} beast, aided {{by the absence of}} first-hand knowledge and the difficulty of reading and interpreting old Arabic script. A decisive shift in description concerned the horn: where Al-Biruni had stuck to the short, curved horn, later writers made it a long, <b>straight</b> <b>horn,</b> which was shifted in artists' representations from the animal's nose to its brow.|$|E
50|$|Chiwara {{masks are}} {{categorized}} in three ways: horizontal, vertical, or abstract. In addition, Chiwara {{can be either}} male or female. Female Chiwara masks are denoted {{by the presence of}} a baby antelope and <b>straight</b> <b>horns.</b> Male Chiwara masks have bent horns and a phallus. The sex of a Chiwara mask is much clearer on horizontal and vertical masks while abstract masks tend to be difficult to classify.|$|R

50|$|The larvae feed on Olea europaea, Ligustrum vulgare, Jasminum polyanthum, Campsis radicans, Tecoma stans, Lonicera japonica, Cotoneaster species, Antirrhinum majus and Clerodendrum paniculatum. Early instars {{are green}} (although {{there is a}} brown colour morph) with a strong nearly <b>straight</b> <b>horn</b> on the tail. Later, it {{develops}} a series of diagonal white stripes on the sides. Full-grown larvae are about 80 mm long. Mature larvae leave their food plant to pupate under the surface debris of loose soil and leaves.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, Newsome began {{focusing}} on solo saxophone performance. After seven years with Global Unity, Newsome took hiatus from performing as a leader. In 2007, he released Monk Abstractions, {{on which he}} recorded the compositions of Thelonious Monk. Mark Corroto from All About Jazz wrote: “Newsome expands {{the sound of a}} single soprano saxophone into a one man band.” All About Jazz - New York named it one of the top tribute CDs of the year. In 2010, Newsome released his second solo saxophone CD, the blues-based Blue Soliloquy. which received five stars in Downbeat magazine. Subsequent solo recordings include The Art of the Soprano, Vol. 1 (2012), Sam Newsome Plays Monk and Ellington (2013), The <b>Straight</b> <b>Horn</b> of Africa: A Path to Liberation - The Art of the Soprano, Vol. 2 (2014), and Sopranoville: New Works for Prepared and Non-Prepared Saxophone (2017).|$|E
5000|$|According to Florus, Tarquin {{celebrated his}} triumphs in the Etruscan fashion, riding a golden chariot drawn by four horses, while wearing a gold-embroidered toga and the tunica palmata, a tunic upon which palm-leaves were embroidered. He also {{introduced}} other Etruscan insignia of civilian authority and military distinction: the sceptre of the king; the trabea, a purple garment that varied in form, but was perhaps {{most often used}} as a mantle; the fasces carried by the lictors; the curule chair; the toga praetexta, later worn by various magistrates and officials; the rings worn by senators; the paludamentum, a cloak associated with military command; and the phalera, a disc of metal worn on a soldier's breastplate during parades, or displayed on the standards of various military units.

5000|$|The {{connection}} that is sometimes {{made with a}} single-horned goat derives from the vision of Daniel:And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over {{the face of the}} whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.

5000|$|W. Franklin Dove {{acknowledged}} that horns don't actually grow from the skull, but instead, {{they are actually}} unattached bits of tissue that eventually root {{their way into the}} skull. He also did more in-depth research about horns and learned that people before him have been creating [...] "unicorn" [...] animals. For example, some sheep were made into single horned sheep by branding two- or three-month-old lambs on their horn buds and then treating them with a mixture of oil and soot while they were healing so that the horns grew {{from the middle of the}} skull. So, Dove reasoned that the positioning of the horns is quite open to natural or artificial variation which would mean that [...] "unicorns" [...] were not a total contradiction of the laws of nature. To test his theory, he took a day old calf and surgically removed its horn buds and cut them so that they would fit together, and then implanted them in the center of the calf's head. The circular horn buds were trimmed flat at their point of contact so as to provide a larger [...] surface. It was expected that the two horn buds would fuse together to form one large horn solidly attached to the skull and located somewhat between the eyes to mimic the horn of the unicorn. The experiment was proven to be successful as the bull grew the horn buds fused together and started to form a single, <b>straight</b> <b>horn</b> about a foot in length. The horn functioned very well for the bull, perhaps even better than the normal horns the bulls have. The bull eventually became the leader of its herd and was rarely challenged. An interesting side effect of this horn was the bulls abnormally docile personality. He also created [...] "unicorns" [...] out of goats as well as cows. Besides making [...] "unicorns" [...] he also made tri-horned animals.|$|E
40|$|Folded horns {{have been}} {{conceived}} as alternatives to straight horns used as resonators and strain amplifiers in power ultrasonic systems. Such systems {{are used for}} cleaning, welding, soldering, cutting, and drilling {{in a variety of}} industries. In addition, several previous NASA Tech Briefs articles have described instrumented drilling, coring, and burrowing machines that utilize combinations of sonic and ultrasonic vibrational actuation. The main advantage of a folded horn, relative to a <b>straight</b> <b>horn</b> of the same resonance frequency, is that the folded horn can be made shorter (that is, its greatest linear dimension measured from the outside can be made smaller). Alternatively, for a given length, the resonance frequency can be reduced. Hence, the folded-horn concept affords an additional degree of design freedom for reducing the length of an ultrasonic power system that includes a horn...|$|E
