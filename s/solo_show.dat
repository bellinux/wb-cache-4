5|$|In 1910 Brooks had {{her first}} <b>solo</b> <b>show</b> at the prestigious Gallery Durand-Ruel, {{displaying}} thirteen paintings, almost all of women or young girls. Some were portraits; others showed anonymous models in interior scenes or against tonal backgrounds, often with pensive or withdrawn expressions.

5|$|When Lichtenstein had {{his first}} <b>solo</b> <b>show</b> at the Leo Castelli Gallery in February 1962, it sold out before opening. Golf Ball {{was one of the}} works that Lichtenstein exhibited. Later, Lichtenstein {{included}} Golf Ball in Still Life with Goldfish Bowl, 1972, and Go for Baroque, 1979. The painting exemplifies the novel superimposition of abstraction and figuration. The work also represents abstraction as a result of elimination of three-dimensionality, chiaroscuro and a landscape context.|$|E
5|$|In 1892 Émile Bernard {{organised}} a small <b>solo</b> <b>show</b> of Van Gogh's {{paintings in}} Paris, and Julien Tanguy exhibited his Van Gogh paintings with several consigned from Johanna van Gogh-Bonger. In April 1894 the Durand-Rue Gallery in Paris {{agreed to take}} 10 paintings on consignment from Van Gogh's estate. In 1896, the Fauvist painter Henri Matisse, then an unknown art student, visited John Peter Russell on Belle Île off Brittany. Russell had been {{a close friend of}} Van Gogh; he introduced Matisse to the Dutchman's work, and gave him a Van Gogh drawing. Influenced by Van Gogh, Matisse abandoned his earth-coloured palette for bright colours.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Rix Nicholas {{returned}} to Australia, and in 1928 she married Edgar Wright, {{whom she had}} met during her travels in the early 1920s. The couple settled at Delegate, New South Wales; their only child, a son named Rix Wright, was born in 1930. Though she continued to paint significant works including The Summer House and The Fair Musterer, Rix Nicholas, a staunch critic of modernism who was disdainful {{of the works of}} emerging major artists such as Russell Drysdale and William Dobell, grew out of step with trends in Australian art. Her pictures remained didactic, portraying an Australian pastoral ideal, and reviews of her exhibitions grew more uneven. She held her last <b>solo</b> <b>show</b> in 1947. Rix Nicholas remained at Delegate until her death in 1961. Her works are held in most major Australian collections, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, Australian War Memorial, National Gallery of Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, and the Queensland Art Gallery.|$|E

Kaabi-Linke received the 2009 Alexandria Biennale's Jury Prize and the 2011 Abraaj Group Art Prize. The latter commissioned her 2011 Flying Carpets, which was {{shown at the}} 54th Venice Biennale and later purchased by and exhibited at the New York Guggenheim Museum in 2016. Kaabi-Linke held a residency at the London Delfina Foundation in 2012, where she was inspired after meeting survivors of domestic violence. She won the Discoveries Prize for emerging art at the 2014 Art Basel Hong Kong, where she exhibited with the Kolkatan Experimenter gallery. One of the judges juxtaposed the social content of her work against the political reservations of other exhibitions in the show. Earlier that year, she completed her Meinstein ("My Stone") project {{in the center of}} Neukölln, a borough of Berlin. Her pavement mosaic uses stones that correspond to the national origins of the borough's residents, which is a largely immigrant population. She described her practice, at that time, as an archaeology of contemporary life. As of 2016, Kaabi-Linke is represented by Lawrie Shabibi of Dubai and Experimenter of Kolkata.|$|E
