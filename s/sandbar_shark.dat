5|$|Based on {{morphological}} similarities, Jack Garrick in 1982 grouped {{this species}} with the bignose shark (C. altimus) and the <b>sandbar</b> <b>shark</b> (C. plumbeus), while Leonard Compagno in 1988 placed {{it as the}} sister species of the grey reef shark (C. amblyrhynchos). A phylogenetic analysis based on allozyme data, published by Gavin Naylor in 1992, indicated that the Caribbean reef shark is the sister taxon to a clade formed by the Galapagos shark (C. galapagensis), dusky shark (C. obscurus), oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus), and the blue shark (Prionace glauca). However, more work is required to fully resolve the interrelationships within Carcharhinus.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Gavin Naylor's 1992 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{allozyme}} sequence data, {{found that the}} silky shark {{is part of a}} group containing large sharks with a ridge between the dorsal fins. One branch within this group contains the <b>sandbar</b> <b>shark</b> (C.plumbeus) and the bignose shark (C.altimus), while the silky shark is the basal member of the other branch and the sister taxon to a clade containing the Caribbean reef shark (C.perezi), Galapagos shark (C.galapagensis), oceanic whitetip shark (C.longimanus), dusky shark (C.obscurus), and blue shark (Prionace glauca). Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis, which included the silky, blue, and bignose sharks, confirmed the closeness of those three species.|$|E
5|$|Stocks off {{the eastern}} United States are {{severely}} overfished; a 2006 stock assessment {{survey by the}} U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) showed that its population had dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. In 1997, the dusky shark {{was identified as a}} Species of Concern by the NMFS, meaning that it warranted conservation concern but there was insufficient information for listing on the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Commercial and recreational retention of dusky sharks was prohibited in 1998, but this has been of limited effectiveness due to high bycatch mortality on multi-species gear. In addition, some 2,000 dusky sharks were caught by recreational fishers in 2003 despite the ban. In 2005, North Carolina implemented a time/area closure to reduce the impact of recreational fishing. To aid conservation efforts, molecular techniques using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been developed that can identify whether marketed shark parts (e.g. fins) are from prohibited species like the dusky shark, versus similar allowed species such as the <b>sandbar</b> <b>shark.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Sandbar</b> <b>sharks</b> {{have been}} disproportionately {{targeted}} by the U.S. commercial shark fisheries in recent decades due to their high fin-to-body weight ratio, and U.S. fishing regulation requiring carcasses to be landed along with shark fins.

The model, incorporating habitat and species-specific data on growth rates, metabolic rate, diet composition, water temperature (range 16. 8 − 27. 9 °C), and population structure, predicted mean daily rations between 2. 17 ± 0. 03 (age- 0) and 1. 30 ± 0. 02 (age- 5) % body mass/day. These daily rations are higher than earlier predictions for <b>sandbar</b> <b>sharks</b> but are comparable to those for ecologically similar shark species.

500|$|As one of {{the most}} common large sharks in coastal waters, the blacktip shark is caught in large numbers by {{commercial}} fisheries throughout the world, using longlines, fixed-bottom nets, bottom trawls, and hook-and-line. The meat is of high quality and marketed fresh, frozen, or dried and salted. In addition, the fins are used for shark fin soup, the skin for leather, the liver oil for vitamins, and the carcasses for fishmeal. Blacktip sharks are {{one of the}} most important species to the northwestern Atlantic shark fishery, second only to the <b>sandbar</b> <b>shark</b> (C. plumbeus). The flesh is considered superior to that of the <b>sandbar</b> <b>shark,</b> resulting in the sandbar and other requiem shark species being sold under the name [...] "blacktip shark" [...] in the United States.

500|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature has {{listed the}} bignose shark as Data Deficient overall, due to {{inadequate}} population and fishery monitoring. The species {{is considered to}} be of concern, however, given it is slow-reproducing and faces widespread heavy fishing pressure. There is evidence that its numbers have recently declined in the Maldives. Furthermore, most bignose shark bycatch occurs in international waters, where a single stock may be affected by multiple fisheries. It is listed as a [...] "highly migratory species" [...] under the 1995 UN Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, but thus far this has not led to significant conservation measures. Regionally, the IUCN has assessed the bignose shark as Near Threatened in the northwestern Atlantic. Though specific data are lacking, it is suspected to have declined there because it is commonly misidentified as the <b>sandbar</b> <b>shark,</b> thus the known decline in <b>sandbar</b> <b>shark</b> numbers resulting from US longline fishing may represent a decline in bignose shark numbers, as well. This species has been assessed as Least Concern in Australian waters, where it faces no significant threats.|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{into the}} winter habitat of {{juvenile}} <b>sandbar</b> <b>sharks,</b> Carcharhinus plumbeus, using pop-up archival satellite transmitters (PSATs).

The principal overwintering areas for this population are likely found off the North and South Carolina coasts. The primary objective of this project was to use a fishery independent method to examine the overwintering location and habitat preferences of large juvenile <b>sandbar</b> <b>sharks.</b> During the summer of 2003, 21 <b>sandbar</b> <b>sharks</b> captured in the Eastern Shore of Virginia bays and lagoons were outfitted with satellite transmitters that were programmed to detach during the winter of 2003 / 2004. Of the 21 transmitters: four transmitters did not report, 12 released prematurely, and five reported on time. Nine of the transmitters reported during the targeted overwintering period (November 2004 through February 2005). The data from these nine transmitters, was used to examine winter habitat preferences and the overwintering localities of large juvenile <b>sandbar</b> <b>sharks.</b> Satellite pop-off locations during the overwintering period were concentrated in central North Carolina coastal waters.

50|$|Overall, {{polyandry}} is {{the dominant}} mating system in lemon <b>sharks</b> and <b>sandbar</b> <b>sharks.</b> However, geography {{can play a role}} in mating systems. For example, western north Atlantic <b>sandbar</b> <b>sharks</b> exhibit polyandry as the dominant mating system whereas in the Central Pacific, <b>sandbar</b> <b>sharks</b> do not have a dominant polyandry mating system. In addition to polyandry, lemon sharks are one of the shark species that engage in philopatry, or the practice of females returning to sites where they have given birth to previous offspring. Females were found to have stronger loyalties to philopatry than males. These sharks gather together at specific mating sites, allowing females to mate with multiple males in one area. Selecting specific nursery sites influence adult fitness, recruitment, and provide a protected area for live offspring to develop.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —Delineation of {{essential}} fish habitat for exploited populations {{is critical to}} proper management. Spatial delineation of summer nurseries for elasmobranchs has received increased attention in recent years; however, temporal patterns of nursery use and the delineation of wintering areas are as critical. The lower Chesapeake Bay is the largest summer nursery for <b>sandbar</b> <b>sharks</b> Carcharhinus plumbeus in the western Atlantic. The goals {{of this study were}} to delineate temporally the use of the nursery and the migratory movements of juvenile <b>sandbar</b> <b>sharks</b> in this estuary, to determine the location of wintering areas, and to determine if philopatry or homing to natal summer nurseries occurs in subsequent years. Longline sampling conducted between 1990 and 1999 indicated that immigration to the bay occurred from late May to early July and was highly correlated with increasing water temperature. Emigration from the estuary occurred in late September and early October and was highly correlated with decreasing day length. We hypothesize that photoperiod is the environmental trigger to begin fall and spring migrations, whereas temperature may elicit the response to move into the estuaries that serve as summer nurseries. Between 1995 and 2003, we tagged 2, 288 juvenile <b>sandbar</b> <b>sharks.</b> Seventy-three sharks were recaptured following 4 – 3, 124 d at liberty and the distance from tagging locations ranged from 0 to 2, 800 km.

40|$|Reducing shark bycatch and {{depredation}} (i. e., {{damage caused}} by sharks to gear, bait, and desired fish species) in pelagic longline fisheries targeting tunas and swordfish is a priority. Electropositive metals (i. e., a mixture of the lanthanide elements lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, and praseodymium) {{have been shown to}} deter spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias, primarily a coastal species) from attacking bait, presumably because of interactions with the electroreceptive system of this shark. We undertook to determine the possible effectiveness of electropositive metals for reducing the interactions of pelagic sharks with longline gear, using <b>sandbar</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharhinus plumbeus, family Carcharhinidae) as a model species. The presence of electropositive metal deterred feeding in groups of juvenile <b>sandbar</b> <b>sharks</b> and altered the swimming patterns of individuals in the absence of food motivation (these individuals generally avoided approaching electropositive metal closer than 100 cm). The former effect was relatively short-lived however; primarily (we assume) because competition with other individuals increased feeding motivation. In field trials with bottom longline gear, electropositive metal placed within 10 cm of the hooks reduced the catch of <b>sandbar</b> <b>sharks</b> by approximately two thirds, compared to the catch on hooks in the proximity of plastic pieces of similar dimensions.
