25|$|Effie <b>sank</b> <b>back</b> in {{the chair}} to think. She wished Lill had found out how many black marks she had, and whether that lady was Mrs. Santa Clausâ€”and had, in fact, {{obtained}} more accurate information about many things.|$|E
25|$|The right-wing Alberta First Party, contesting {{its first}} election, {{failed to win}} any seats or come close to winning any. The Social Credit Party, led by James Albers, was unable to build on its {{moderate}} success in the 1997 election, and <b>sank</b> <b>back</b> into obscurity. Socred leader Lavern Ahlstrom, however, performed well in Rocky Mountain House and finished second behind the incumbent Ty Lund.|$|E
25|$|But word reached Lillinonah of her father's {{arrangement}} with Eagle Feather -- and she reacted immediately. Down {{on the shore}} of the Housatonic River, now rapid and swollen with the heavy rains of autumn, she climbed into a canoe and shoved off into the teeth of the roaring current. As the canoe was carried faster and faster toward the turbulent waters above the dangerous falls of the river, Lillinonah tossed away her paddle and <b>sank</b> <b>back</b> {{in the bottom of the}} canoe to await her fate.|$|E

2500|$|An exultant Stilwell {{immediately}} delivered {{this letter}} to Chiang despite pleas from Patrick J. Hurley, Roosevelt's special envoy in China, to delay delivering {{the message and}} work on a deal that would achieve Stilwell's aim in a manner more acceptable to Chiang. Stillwell wrote in his diary about handing over Roosevelt's message: [...] "I handed this bundle of paprika to the Peanut and than <b>sank</b> <b>back</b> with a sigh. The harpoon hit the little bugger right in the solar plexus and went right through him. It was a clean hit, but beyond turning green and losing his powers of speech, he did not bat an eye". The British journalist Jonathan Fenby wrote about Roosevelt's letter: [...] "Unless the President was ready for America to take over effective control of China, or halt Lend-Lease supplies and abandon the KMT to its fate, his stern words merely amounted to bluff". Seeing this act as a move toward the complete subjugation of China, Chiang gave a formal reply {{in which he said}} that Stilwell must be replaced immediately and he would welcome any other qualified U.S. general to fill Stilwell's position. Chiang called Roosevelt's letter the [...] "greatest humiliation I have been subjected to in my life" [...] and stated it was [...] "all too obvious that the United States intends to intervene in China's internal affairs". Chiang told Hurley the Chinese people were [...] "tired of the insults which Stillwell has seen fit to heap upon them". Chiang delivered a speech before the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, which was leaked to the press, which called Roosevelt's letter a form of imperialism and stated that to accept Roosevelt's demands would make him no different from the Japanese collaborator Wang Jingwei in Nanking. On 12 October 1944, Hurley reported to Washington that Stilwell was a [...] "fine man, but was incapable of understanding or co-operating with Chiang Kai-shek", going on to say that if Stilwell remained in command, all of China might be lost to the Japanese. Before sending his cable, Hurley showed it to Stilwell who accused Hurley [...] to his face of [...] "cutting my throat with a dull knife".|$|E

60|$|He {{sat down}} on the sofa by the window. The energy had {{suddenly}} left all his limbs. He sat with his head sunk, listening.
