25|$|The epoxy/core test, detects voids by {{visual and}} {{mechanical}} methods. It consists of drilling a 25 to 50 millimeter {{hole through the}} pavement into the <b>sub-base</b> with a dry-bit roto-hammer. Next, a two-part epoxy is poured into the hole – dyed for visual clarity. Once the epoxy hardens, technicians drill through the hole. If a void is present, the epoxy will stick to the core and provide physical evidence.|$|E
25|$|The process {{consists}} of pumping a cementitous grout or polyurethane mixture through holes drilled through the slab. The grout can fill small voids beneath the slab and/or <b>sub-base.</b> The grout also displaces free water and helps keep water from saturating and weakening support under the joints and slab edge after stabilization is complete. The three steps for this method after finding the voids are locating and drilling holes, grout injection and post-testing the stabilized slabs.|$|E

25|$|Since 1921 {{the intent}} was to place a {{superstructure}} {{on top of the}} Tomb, {{but it was not until}} July 3, 1926, that Congress authorized the completion of the Tomb and the expenditure of $50,000 (with a completed cost of $48,000). A design competition was held and won by architect Lorimer Rich and sculptor Thomas Hudson Jones. An appropriation from Congress for the work was secured and on December 21, 1929, a contract for completion of the Tomb itself was entered into. The Tomb would consist of seven pieces of marble in four levels (cap, die, base and <b>sub-base)</b> of which the die is the largest block with the sculpting on all four sides.|$|E
500|$|The earth {{material}} {{used for}} the embankments was planned {{to come from the}} road foundation works, but rainfall meant it was no longer fit for purpose and had to be imported instead. In total, [...] of earth was excavated, with a further [...] of material imported for filling. The <b>sub-base</b> consisted of burnt red shale with thickness dependent upon the ground conditions, followed by a layer of wet mix around [...] thick and topped with 2–3 inches (approximately [...] ) of tarmac lined with 0.5-1 inches (approximately [...] ) of asphalt. A total of 22 bridges were required in construction, and designers were given relative freedom in planning them. Chief engineer Drake proposed the bridges be painted different colours to enhance aesthetics and help alleviate driver boredom, contrary to conventional practice of using neutral colours; drivers subsequently reacted favourably to alternately coloured bridges.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis occupies {{with use}} of fine aggregates in hydraulically bound mixtures for road pavement bases and <b>sub-bases.</b> The theoretical part describes properties of bound mixtures, aggregates and bound materials. This part also deals with laboratory methods used for bound mixtures and foreign research. In the practical part sand and gravel, crushed stone and recycled fine aggregates are used in bound mixtures with cement or cement and fluidized bed combustion ash. The unconfined compressive strength and frost and water resistance of bound mixtures are tested. The results of laboratory tests are evaluated and compared. The used mixtures are mostly found as suitable for pavement <b>sub-bases...</b>|$|R

2500|$|A poorly {{constructed}} and maintained road network. Poor construction methods included low quality sub-bases and improperly placed or missing curbs. It {{was not clear}} from the records that the roads were constructed to accommodate the medium or heavy vehicles which often used them. Maintenance issues included extensively cracked road surfaces. In some cases, roads were not repaired by removing the entire road structure but rather by removing only the asphalt or concrete and laying a new road atop the aging, inadequate, crumbling base and <b>sub-base.</b> The Corps estimated that 60 percent of the cemetery's [...] of roads were in poor condition.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, Palmdale Army Airfield was {{activated}} as a United States Army Air Corps (later Air Forces) airfield {{for use as}} {{an emergency}} landing strip and for B-25 Mitchell medium bomber support training during World War II. It {{was one of many}} intermediate fields that were used as auxiliary fields or emergency landing fields by the AAF during World War II. Their dispersion along the air routes, their infrequent use, and their U.S. government ownership made them ideal for use by military aircraft.

Some parking aprons and connecting taxiways are also part of the project, which will be supervised for the Mobile District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers by Resident Engineer James K. Glennon. Work commenced on 15 December 1955. The runway was expected to be completed in January 1957. [...] "The use of barges for delivery of materials is being used extensively. Oyster shell is being dredged from Choctawhatchee Bay and delivered to Garnier Bayou by barge. Gravel is also being delivered by barge to Weekly Bayou on Eglin Main Base. From the above barge delivery points, the materials are then hauled by truck to the construction site. Slag for manufacture of asphaltic concrete is shipped from Birmingham, Ala., and cement concrete will be shipped by rail from the Ideal Cement Company, Mobile, Ala." ...|$|E

The die was worked by 75 men for one year and three attempts until a 56-ton (55.86 metric) block came out of the quarry in late January 1931. [...] When the block was cut from the mountain it weighed 124 tons (123.69 metric). [...] A wire saw was then brought in to cut the block down to 56 tons (55.68 metric). [...] Because of the weight, Vermont Marble Company sent to the quarry a special derrick that was reinforced and heavily rigged. The initial lift was just enough to clear the quarry floor so the block could hang for 15 minutes while the hoist was inspected for stress. [...] Once out of the quarry, the trip to down to Marble took four days with the die block arriving {{on the grounds of the}} mill site on 3 February 1931. [...] On 8 February, the block was shipped to Vermont for cutting to final dimensions and carving the pilasters and bas-relief. [...] The work was completed in September and arrived at Arlington National Cemetery the same month. [...] Assembly started in September but after the base piece was put in place, imperfections were discovered halting the work until a replacement was received. [...] Three attempts were made before an acceptable piece was quarried. [...] In December, the replacement base arrived and the assembly was completed 31 December 1931. [...] This was followed by the carving work on the die block by the Piccirilli Brothers (who also carved the statue of Lincoln for the Lincoln Memorial) under the supervision of Tomb sculptor William Hudson Jones. When the Tomb assembly was completed 9 April 1932, the structure had the following dimensions.|$|E
