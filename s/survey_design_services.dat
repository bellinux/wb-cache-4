40|$|Vegetation {{maps are}} {{critical}} biodiversity planning instruments, but {{the classification of}} vegetation for mapping can be strongly biased by <b>survey</b> <b>design.</b> Standardization of <b>survey</b> <b>design</b> across different vegetation types is therefore increasingly recommended for vegetation mapping programs. However, some vegetation types have complex small-scale vegetation patterns {{that are important in}} characterizing these vegetation types, and standard designs will often not capture these patterns. The objective of this paper was to investigate the magnitude of potential map bias that results from <b>survey</b> <b>design</b> standardization and recommend approaches to deal with this bias. We surveyed upland swamps of the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area Australia using two contrasting <b>survey</b> <b>designs,</b> including the standard 400 [*]m 2 single quadrat design recommended and used by authorities. We then derived a classification for these swamps and tested the effect of <b>survey</b> <b>design</b> on this classification, species richness and the type of species detected (obligate or facultative swamp species). Species richness and species type were not significantly different among survey techniques. However, more than 40 % of swamps clustered differently among <b>survey</b> <b>designs.</b> Thus, one of the 10 derived communities (which is floristically consistent with a previously mapped endangered community) was indistinct, and some individual swamps misclassified using the standard <b>survey</b> <b>design.</b> An effect of landscape position on swamp floristic patterns and a significant trend for high similarity scores among swamps surveyed with multiple small quadrats compared to the standard <b>survey</b> <b>design</b> was also determined. Australian upland swamps are classified at the global scale as shrub-dominated wetlands, and complex floristic patterns have been recorded in shrub-dominated wetlands in both northern and southern hemispheres.

40|$|Recently, survey {{methodology}} {{literature has}} put forward responsive and adaptive <b>survey</b> <b>designs</b> as {{means to make}} efficient tradeoffs between survey quality and <b>survey</b> costs. The <b>designs,</b> however, restrict quality-cost assessments to nonresponse error, while there are various design features that impact also measurement error, e. g. the survey mode, the type of questionnaire (long or condensed) {{and the type of}} reporting (self or proxy). Extension of adaptive <b>survey</b> <b>design</b> to measurement error is, however, not straightforward when a survey has many and diverse survey items. An adaptive <b>survey</b> <b>design</b> needs to make an overall choice of design features that applies to all survey items simultaneously. In this paper, we investigate adaptive <b>survey</b> <b>designs</b> that account for both nonresponse and measurement error. In order to do so, we model the underlying causes for differences in measurement error between design features. This leads to response styles or response latencies. We tailor efforts so that either response style propensities are minimized or constrained.

40|$|There is wide {{variation}} in how consumption {{is measured in}} household surveys both across countries and over time. This variation may confound welfare comparisons in part because these alternative <b>survey</b> <b>designs</b> produce consumption estimates that are differentially influenced by contrasting types of survey response error. Although previous studies have documented the extent of net error in alternative <b>survey</b> <b>designs,</b> {{little is known about}} the relative influence of the different response errors that underpin a survey estimate. This study leverages a recent randomized food consumption survey experiment in Tanzania to shed light on the relative influence of these various error types. The observed deviation of measured household consumption from a benchmark is decomposed into item-specific consumption incidence and consumption value so as to investigate effects related to (a) the omission of any consumption and then (b) the error in value reporting conditional on positive consumption. The results show that various <b>survey</b> <b>designs</b> exhibit widely differing error decompositions, and hence a simple summary comparison of the total recorded consumption across surveys will obscure specific error patterns and inhibit the lessons for improved consumption <b>survey</b> <b>design.</b> In light of these findings, the relative performance of common <b>survey</b> <b>designs</b> is discussed, and design lessons are drawn to enhance the accuracy of item-specific consumption reporting and, consequently, the measures of total household food consumption. status: accepte...|$|R

The accuracy and precision of estimates are determined to a large extent by the <b>survey</b> <b>design</b> used to obtain population samples. Methods for optimizing the <b>survey</b> <b>design</b> process are detailed, with a particular- focus on automating the sui-vey designs using computer software. The technique of automated <b>survey</b> <b>design</b> is a simulation-based tool, which provides the means to assess the properties of any type of <b>survey</b> <b>design,</b> permits the evaluation of abundance estimates over sui-vey regions with assumed population densities, and from a practical standpoint facilitates the creation of a survey plan that can be implemented in the field. <b>Survey</b> <b>design</b> properties include the probability of a particular location being included in the sample, the spatial distribution of the sampling locations within the survey region, and the distances covered by observers to obtain the sample data. The design properties are directly linked to the accuracy and precision of estimates, as well as the efficiency, achieved by a type of design. A comparative study of a number of different <b>survey</b> <b>designs</b> that can be broadly classified as systematic or non-systematic is presented. The simulation results show their performance with regard to the above-mentioned properties and the abundance estimates obtained if the designs are applied to some known population densities. Due to the more even spatial distribution of the systematic designs the estimates they produce are potentially more precise and the distances covered by observers less variable as well. It is also shown how biased estimates can result if the probability of a particular location being included in the sample is assumed to be even over the entire survey region when it is not. The problems associated with surveying along the boundary of a survey region and within non-convex regions are addressed.
