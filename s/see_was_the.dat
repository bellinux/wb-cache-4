25|$|After {{being called}} Kid Apocalypse by Kid Omega, Evan begins {{learning}} about Apocalypse and is saddened {{that he himself}} looks like the villain, raising {{the possibility of a}} future that Evan rejects. After saving Angel and discovering that he possesses the ability to see the essence of those he looks upon, Evan asks him to tell him what he sees when he looks at him. Angel tells En he sees only goodness inside him, which makes Evan happy, so he thanks Angel for being a good friend. In fact, Angel lied, as the only thing he could <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> dark image of Apocalypse.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1720, Minas Gerais {{was part}} of the {{captaincy}} of São Vicente (later renamed São Paulo e Minas de Ouro). The first capital of Minas Gerais, and seat of the local <b>see,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> city of Mariana; it was later moved to Vila Rica. In the late 18th century, Vila Rica was the largest city in Brazil {{and one of the most}} populous in America. As the gold mines were exhausted over the 19th century, the city lost its importance; it was later renamed Ouro Preto and remained the state capital until the construction of the all-new, planned city of Belo Horizonte at the turn of the 20th century. The gold cycle left its mark in cities such as Mariana, Ouro Preto, Diamantina, Sabará, Tiradentes and São João del Rei. The relative isolation from European influence, added to the huge influx of gold and other valuable minerals, helped the local people to develop their own style of art, which became known as Barroco Mineiro. Prime examples of this period are the richly decorated churches in the colonial cities. The most important artist of this period was Antônio Francisco Lisboa, who became known as Aleijadinho. His sculptural and architectural work is highly valued by experts as one of the most refined artistic expressions outside Europe at that time.|$|E
500|$|Mercury {{released}} the demo in 1989 as The Kentucky Headhunters' debut album, Pickin' on Nashville. The album produced four singles, {{all of which}} reached top 40 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart. The first of these, the [...] "Walk Softly on This Heart of Mine" [...] cover, peaked at number 25 in December 1989. After it came [...] "Dumas Walker," [...] about a then-74-year-old marbles player who owned a liquor store that the band frequented. According to Doug, Mercury Records was initially reluctant to release the song as a single: [...] " [...] thought it was too regional, {{and that no one}} outside the area would get it, but what they didn't <b>see,</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> reaction we got to it every night that we played it in front of a crowd, and it didn't matter where we were playing either." [...] The single peaked at number 15 on the Billboard chart.|$|E

500|$|The {{island has}} been {{structured}} {{to provide a}} fair mix of puzzle solving, exploration, and narrative elements while avoiding a [...] "paradox of choice" [...] by giving the player too much freedom and not knowing where to go next. According to artist Luis Antonio, {{one of the first}} things that Blow wanted the player to <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> mountain to make them aware as this being their ultimate goal. The game initially started the player in an abandoned bunker converted to living space, but as it was originally arranged, the player would exit the bunker not facing the mountain. Though they attempted to move and rotate the bunker space around to meet Blow's goal, it was ultimately scrapped in favor of a simpler space with interior elements that fit with other portions of the game, and which the player would climb out into the external environment with the mountain in full view. This introductory area was also meant to serve as the game's tutorial, helping players to understand fundamental mechanics of one must switch between solving puzzles and exploring the environment to find others, and Thekla spent a great detail of time fine-tuning the details to be clear without verbal explanation. The team's artists worked to support Blow's objective of guiding the player by using contrasts of color and of natural and man-made structures to highlight areas that the player would be drawn towards. Blow wanted the game's art to start off with bright colors and high saturation, to present a type of optimism to the player, while later settings in the game would become less bright. He also wanted to make sure all elements of the game world stood out to avoid visual noise within the game that may have interfered with puzzle solving. To accomplish this, he and his team often had to review the game as if they were a new player to it, and identify what elements they were visually drawn to; this would often identify features of the island they had incorporated early on but were no longer appropriate for the final game.|$|E
2500|$|Associate Justice Harold <b>See</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> heavy {{favorite}} to win the Republican nomination because of his support from the state business community and the party hierarchy, including Chief Justice Hooper. However, as Moore made headway in state polls, See elicited the help of Republican strategist Karl Rove, advisor to Texas Governor and future President George W. Bush. Despite Rove's support and significantly more campaign funding, See lost the primary to Moore. [...] Judge Moore also beat two other opponents, Criminal Appeals Judge Pam Baschab, and Jefferson County Presiding Circuit Judge Wayne Thorn, in the Republican Primary—without a runoff—garnering over 50% of the statewide primary vote. Judge Moore then easily defeated Democratic contender Sharon Yates in November's general election with over 60% of the vote. [...] Judge Moore won his election to Chief Justice with just over $200,000, compared to the over $2 million spent by his opponents.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was once}} {{held that the}} Scotland's episcopal sees and entire parochial system owed its origins to the {{innovations}} of David I. Today, scholars have moderated this view. Although David moved the bishopric of Mortlach east to his new burgh of Aberdeen, and arranged {{the creation of the}} diocese of Caithness, no other bishoprics can be safely called David's creation. The bishopric of Glasgow was restored rather than resurrected. In the case of the Bishop of Whithorn, the resurrection of that <b>see</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> work of Thurstan, Archbishop of York, with King Fergus of Galloway and the cleric Gille Aldan. That aside, Ailred of Rievaulx wrote in David's eulogy that when David came to power, [...] "he found three or four bishops in the whole Scottish kingdom , and the others wavering without a pastor to the loss of both morals and property; when he died, he left nine, both of ancient bishoprics which he himself restored, and new ones which he erected". What is very likely is that, as well as preventing the long vacancies in bishoprics which had hitherto been common, David was at least partly responsible for forcing semi-monastic [...] "bishoprics" [...] like Brechin, Dunkeld, Mortlach (Aberdeen) and Dublane to become fully episcopal and firmly integrated into a national diocesan system. As {{for the development of the}} parochial system, David's traditional role as its creator can not be sustained. Scotland already had an ancient system of parish churches dating to the Early Middle Ages, and the kind of system introduced by David's Normanising tendencies can more accurately be seen as mild refashioning, rather than creation; he made the Scottish system as a whole more like that of France and England, but he did not create it.|$|E
