5000|$|Homosexuality: An Annotated Bibliography was {{reviewed}} by Hugo G. Beigel in the Journal of Sex Research, and the sociologist Edward Sagarin in Contemporary Sociology. Sagarin's review was positive. He wrote that Bell and Weinberg's work overshadowed a similar anthology, Homosexuality: A <b>Selective</b> <b>Bibliography</b> of over 3,000 Items, edited by William Parker. Sagarin noted that while Bell and Weinberg's book contained fewer items than Parker's, {{they were all}} [...] "carefully selected, read and abstracted, {{and then all the}} material cross-indexed in a manner that almost defies improvement." [...] In 1975, Bell wrote in Archives of Sexual Behavior that in his view he and Weinberg had provided a [...] "comprehensive statement" [...] of the past and present state of research into homosexuality in Homosexuality: An Annotated Bibliography. In 1987, M. S. Martin wrote in Choice, published by Conari Press, that Homosexuality: An Annotated Bibliography had still not been superseded as an annotated bibliography on its topic. Fang-fu Ruan and Yung-mei Tsai, writing in Archives of Sexual Behavior, criticized Homosexuality: An Annotated Bibliography for failing to list [...] "a single study or recording on Chinese homosexual life".|$|E
