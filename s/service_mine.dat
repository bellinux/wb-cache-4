40|$|The {{shifting}} {{focus of}} service from the 1980 s to 2000 s has proved that IT not only lowers {{the cost of}} service but creates avenues to enhance and increase revenue through service. The new type of service, e-service, is mobile, flexible, interactive, and interchangeable. While service science provides an avenue for future service researches, the specific research areas from the IT perspective {{still need to be}} elaborated. This book introduces a novel concept-service mining-to address several research areas from technology, model, management, and application perspectives. <b>Service</b> <b>mining</b> is defined as "a systematical process including service discovery, service experience, service recovery, and service retention to discover unique patterns and exceptional values within the existing services. " The goal of <b>service</b> <b>mining</b> is similar to data mining, text mining, or web mining, and aims to "detect something new" from the service pool. The major difference is the feature of service is quite distinct from the mining target, like data or text.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} forWeb <b>service</b> <b>mining.</b> Web <b>service</b> <b>mining</b> is a new research discipline. It is different from conventional top down service composition approaches that are driven by specific search criteria. Web <b>service</b> <b>mining</b> starts with no such criteria and aims at the discovery of interesting and useful compositions of existing Web <b>services.</b> Web <b>service</b> <b>mining</b> requires the study of three main research topics: semantic description of Web services, efficient bottom up composition of composable services, and in-terestingness and usefulness evaluation of composed services. We first propose a Web service ontology to describe and organize the constructs of a Web service. We introduce the concept of Web service operation interface for the description of shared Web service capabilities and use Web service domains for grouping Web service capabilities based on these interfaces. We take clues from how Nature solves the problem of molecular composition and introduce the notion of Web service recognition to help devise efficient bottom up service composition strategies. We introduce several service recognition mechanisms that {{take advantage of the}} domain-based categorization of Web service capabilities and ontology-based description of operation semantics.

40|$|Abstract—Web service tags, i. e., terms {{annotated}} {{by users}} {{to describe the}} functionality or other aspects of Web services, are being treated as collective user knowledge for Web <b>service</b> <b>mining.</b> Since user tagging is inherently uncontrolled, ambiguous, and overly personalized, a critical and fundamental problem is how to measure the relevance of a user-contributed tag {{with respect to the}} functionality of the annotated Web service. In this paper, we propose a hybrid mechanism by using WSDL documents and service-tag network information to compute the relevance scores of tags by employing semantic computation and HITS model, respectively. Further, we introduce tag relevance measurement mechanism into three applications of Web service mining: 1) Web service clustering; 2) Web service tag recommendation; and 3) Tag-based Web service retrieval. To evaluate the accuracy of tag relevance measurement and its impact to Web <b>service</b> <b>mining,</b> experiments are implemented based on Titan which is a Web service search engine constructed based on 15, 968 real Web services. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tag relevance measurement mechanism and its active promotion to the usage of tagging data in Web <b>service</b> <b>mining...</b>|$|R
