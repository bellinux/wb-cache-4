40|$|To better {{understand}} the relationship between the U.

Examining <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> court decisions in search and seizure cases decided by the Supreme Court between 1983 and 1993, we specifically test hypotheses about how state judicial context and Supreme Court behavior influences when the lower court is likely to be affected by Supreme Court precedent. We find that there is substantial variation in the responses to precedent by <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> courts. We find that precedent has a substantial influence on the behavior of <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> court justices, but judicial ideology and the level of historical conflict between the Supreme Court and the <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> court also influence the dissemination of precedent to the states. Most interesting, the effect of judicia...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to answer what causes dissent in <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> courts. It also approaches the normative questions of whether dissent in <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> courts {{is good or}} bad for democracy. Within I review relevant literature on <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> courts, judicial voting behavior and dissent. I also conduct my own study of <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> courts. I find that limited resources affect nonconsensual opinion writing on <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> courts. I do this by creating an OLS regression model showing that the employment of law clerks causes more nonconsensual opinions and a larger caseload causes less nonconsensual opinion writing. I also find that more dissent is consistent with the democratic tradition, as it enables more voices to be heard...|$|R
40|$|<b>State</b> <b>supreme</b> courts {{occasionally}} rely on {{the provisions}} of their own state constitutions to expand rights for their citizens beyond the protections that the U. S. Supreme Court has interpreted the U. S. Constitution to require. This practice {{is known as the}} New Judicial Federalism. <b>State</b> <b>supreme</b> courts have the prerogative to recognize more expansive rights under their state constitutions because the U. S. Constitution sets a floor and not a ceiling for the protection of individual rights. On the other hand, the U. S. Supreme Court has unmatched resources as well as unparalleled prestige, and most <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> courts give considerable respect and deference to its interpretations of common or similar constitutional language. The challenge for political scientists is to explain why some <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> courts have chosen to expand rights and why other courts prefer to follow the example and interpretation of the U. S. Supreme Court. I hypothesize that <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> courts are engaged in an ongoing dialogue about rights by considering the reasoning contained in sister <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> court decisions, prior deciding court precedent, and changes in U. S. Supreme Court precedent, when deciding whether to expand rights under state constitutions. This dissertation examines the decisions of <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> courts, as well as interviews with <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> court justices, to examine why <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> courts sometimes render rights expanding decisions, but more often follow the approach adopted by the U. S. Supreme Court in interpreting the U. S. Constitutio...|$|R

5|$|In 1867, United <b>States</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court justice Stephen Johnson Field {{assigned}} Deady {{to serve}} as a circuit court judge for the United States circuit court located in San Francisco, California. Deady did the same in 1868 and 1869 since there was no circuit court judge assigned to the West Coast at that time, spending three months in San Francisco each year. This was a common practice during this period, as United <b>States</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court justices still rode circuit, and often assigned federal district court judges to serve on the appellate level circuit courts. The Judiciary Act of 1869 reduced much of this process, as did the Judiciary Act of 1891 that established the current United States courts of appeals with Oregon in the Ninth Circuit. While serving on the district court, Deady {{served as president of the}} Board of Regents of the State University (later University of Oregon) from 1873 to 1893.
