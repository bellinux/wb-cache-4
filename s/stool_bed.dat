40|$|To {{evaluate}} the adaptability {{and performance of}} new and promising apple rootstocks in the dwarfing size-control category, a NC- 140 regional rootstock trial was established in 2010 at 12 sites in the United States (CO, IA, IL, IN, MA, MI, MN, NJ, NY, OH, UT, WI), two sites in Canada (BC, NS), and one site in Mexico (CHIH) with Honeycrisp serving as the test cultivar. The Iowa planting, located at the ISU Horticulture Research Station, includes 31 rootstocks with new selections from the Cornell-Geneva breeding program (G, CG.), Russia (Bud), Germany (PiAu), and Japan (Supp), with M. 26, M. 9 Pajam 2, and M. 9 T 337 serving as industry standards.

40|$|In {{the winter}} of 1990 the nucleus of a Magnolia {{collection}} was planted at Lincoln University. This was in a block within the Horticultural Research Area that was no longer required as a <b>stool</b> <b>bed</b> for producing apple rootstocks. Additional plants were purchased in 1991 and 1992. These replaced a smaller existing number of established magnolias, removed {{to make way for}} the then new Commerce Building. After 1992 further development was slow until a grant was given by the Brian Mason Scientific & Technical Trust to increase the collection. In June 1998 the Brian Mason Scientific & Technical Trust awarded a grant of $ 5000 for additional plant material and labelling. With that grant the collection has been broadened from magnolias to include other genera and species within the Magnoliaceae family. The collection now includes approximately one hundred and twenty plants from four genera; Magnolia, Manglietia, Michelia and Liriodendron. Three other lesser known genera; Elmerrillia, Kmeria and Pachylarnax also belong to the Magnoliaceae family, but are not represented in the collection. The closest New Zealand examples includes Pseudowintera species which at one stage were regarded as being in the Magnoliaceae, but are now classified in a closely related family the Winteraceae. Currently there are still a number of species that will be added to the collection when we able to source the seed or plants. Most of the species within the Lincoln University collection are native to temperate eastern Asia and North America...|$|E

Fig cultivar Sarilop was used as a material. It is the best fig cultivar for drying and it can also be consumed fresh. The mother plants were planted horizontally with distance of 70 x 60 cm in November {{after the fall of the}} leaves. In February, all the buds on the ground side of plants were blunted and plants were fixed parallel (layered) to the ground surface with prongs made of a thick galvanized wire in the shape of U. Bottom parts of the new shoots which developed from the mother plants and reached 20 cm were covered by 10 cm of soil. Bottom parts of the newly formed shoots were continuously covered with the soil taken from between the rows appropriately to the development of the shoots during vegetation period. At the end of the vegetation period, eighty nursery plants of different sizes were obtained from twenty mother plants. Most of the nursery plants (77. 5 %) had sufficient qualitative and quantitative features for sale.

40|$|The {{potential}} to use micropropagation protocols {{in combination with}} a nursery production system via <b>stool</b> <b>beds</b> is attractive. Somatic embryogenesis protocols would amplify high value control-pollinated seed and organogenesis of the resulting mature somatic embryos (SE) would provide {{a large number of}} uniform shoots for initial production of <b>stool</b> <b>beds.</b> SE material held in liquid nitrogen could then be used to provide a supply of juvenile <b>stool</b> <b>beds</b> over a number of years. Successful results have been obtained with initiation and proliferation of Douglas-fir embryogenic cultures at Scion. These protocols have been developed using modified Pinus radiata media and methods and provide Scion with protocols for the micropropagation of Douglas-fir. Mature somatic embryos (from 5 cell lines) had their bases removed and were placed on Pinus radiata organogenic media (LPch) to establish shoot cultures. Shoots were sub-cultured every 4 - 6 weeks, transferring to jars when elongated. Whenever possible, stem segments were isolated from the elongated shoots and transferred to petri dishes for multiplication. Multiplication data was collected for 30 weeks. Thirty organogenic shoots from each of the five SE cell lines were used to test four different pre-rooting treatments. Shoots were transferred to the nursery propagation house after 11 days. The results of these pre-rooting treatments on the ability of the shoots to produce roots will be presented and future work discussed...|$|R

Criteria-based evaluations centered on aesthetics, function, and fall color were performed to objectively select superior bigtooth maple specimens. Out of 56 trees initially selected for red fall color, six were selected for propagation based on all three criteria. Five of the six selected trees yielded viable bud take via chip budding. Optimum time for chip budding propagation was determined by four experiments. Coppiced seedling rootstocks were used with the 2 ̆ 2 return budding 2 ̆ 2 of excised buds as scions to parent stock (2006) and grafting buds from wild trees as scions (2007 and 2009). A fourth experiment examined chip budding of wild scions on 2 -year-old, containerized, seedling rootstocks. The general time period identified as the optimum time for budding bigtooth maple was July through mid-August. Propagation by cuttings was also explored as an alternative production method among bigtooth maple selections. Softwood cuttings were taken from six selections of wild bigtooth maples grafted on seedling rootstocks growing in a coppiced <b>stool</b> <b>bed</b> environment. Open-ended, black, velour, drawstring bags were placed over the end of pruned shoots at bud swell to initiate etiolation of the cuttings. The bags were left in place during shoot elongation to insure etiolation of the shoot base. Cuttings were harvested after 3 to 4 weeks, wounded, dipped in auxin, and placed on heating mats under an intermittent mist system. Rooting was evaluated on the cuttings after four weeks.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The present {{studies were}} {{conducted}} {{to better understand the}} etiology, epidemiology and potential control of the Phytophthora stem root rot as it occurs in apple <b>stool</b> <b>beds.</b> Symptoms of Phytophthora root and stem rot occurred as early as May and continued to develop throughout the growing season. Sunken brown-black lesions were visible on shoots, some of which wilted, or exhibited rust-brown or purplish bronzed leaves. Infected roots were red-brown. Some stem lesions were yellow-brown with narrow dark brown margins forming concentric, wavy-margined rings up the stem. Phytophthora cactorum and P. cambivora were both recovered from the <b>stool</b> <b>beds</b> and identified as the probable causal agents of the disease. P. cactorum was more frequently isolated with peak recovery in early September. P. cambivora recovery peaked in mid summer. Both species were pathogenic at either 15 or 24 °C, but P. cactorum was more virulent than P. cambivora at both temperatures and is probably the more active of the two species in the field as well. Fosetyl-Al and metalaxyl applied to apple rootstocks in the field reduced the severity of disease subsequently induced by P. cactorum in an excised stem assay. These field treatments also reduced the development of disease in trees graded as healthy and held in cold storage for 3 to 9 months. Root dipping pre-, post-, or pre- and post-cold storage of trees graded either as healthy or mildly infected, with the chemicals benalaxyl, etridiazol, fosetyl-Al or metalaxyl gave variable results. Any chemical dip treatment reduced disease development compared to the untreated controls, but fosetyl-Al and metalaxyl at 12000 or 4000 ppm, respectively, applied pre-cold storage gave the best disease control over all. The development in apple <b>stool</b> <b>beds</b> of stem and root rot caused by P. cactorum and P. cambivora was reduced in the field by applications of fosetyl-Al and/or metalaxyl applied to trees during the growing season, and reduced further by a root dip before cold storage...|$|R

Rooms may also be fitted with polished steel mirrors bolted to the wall, an electric light that can be shut off only remotely, a radio, and on rare occasions, a black-and-white television that shows recreational, educational, and religious programming. In addition, all cells are soundproofed to prevent prisoners from communicating with each other via Morse code.|$|R
50|$|Leather, one of {{the most}} common {{materials}} available, was used for many products, including saddles, chaps, whips, window and door coverings, riatas (leather braided rope), trousers, hats, <b>stools,</b> chairs, <b>bed</b> frames, etc. Leather was even used for leather armor where soldiers' jackets were made from several layers of hardened leather sewn together. This stiff leather jacket was sufficient to stop most Indian arrows and worked well when fighting the Indians. Beef was a common constituent of most Californio meals and since it couldn't be kept long in the days before refrigeration, beef was often slaughtered to get a few steaks or cuts of meat. The property and yards around the ranchos were marked by the large number of dead cow heads, horns or other animal parts. Cow hides were kept later for trading purposes with Yankee or British traders who started showing up once or twice a year after 1825. Beef, wheat bread products, corn (maize), several types of beans, peas and several types of squash were common meal items with wine and olive oil used when they could be found. The mestizo population probably subsisted mostly on what they were used to: corn or maize, beans, and squash with some beef donated by the rancho owners. What the average Native Americans ate is unknown since they were in transition from a hunter gatherer society to agriculturalists. Formerly, many lived at least part of the year on ground acorns, fish, seeds, wild game, etc. It is known that many of the ranchers complained about Indians stealing their cattle and horses to eat.|$|R
