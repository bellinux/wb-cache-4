5|$|Approximately 35% of {{echinoderm}} genera became extinct at the K–Pg boundary, although taxa that {{thrived in}} low-latitude, shallow-water environments {{during the late}} Cretaceous had the highest extinction rate.

The pattern of extinction points to habitat loss, <b>specifically</b> <b>the</b> drowning of carbonate platforms, the shallow-water reefs in existence at that time, by the extinction event.|$|E
