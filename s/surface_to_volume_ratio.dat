25|$|Porous silicon (pSi) {{is a form}} of the {{chemical}} element silicon which has an introduced nanoporous holes in its microstructure, rendering a large <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> in the order of 500m2/cm3. It was first discovered by accident in 1956 at Bell Labs by Arthur Uhlir Jr. and Ingeborg Uhlir.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{activated}} carbons (R 1) {{are made}} in particulate form as powders or fine granules less than 1.0mm in size with an average diameter between 0.15 and 0.25mm. Thus they present a large <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> with a small diffusion distance. Activated carbon (R 1) {{is defined as the}} activated carbon particles retained on a 50-mesh sieve (0.297mm).|$|E
25|$|Smaller {{diameter}} coils {{have better}} rates of heat transfer than conventional sized coils {{and they can}} withstand higher pressures required by {{the new generation of}} environmentally friendlier refrigerants. Smaller diameter coils also have lower material costs because they require less refrigerant, fin, and coil materials; and they enable the design of smaller and lighter high-efficiency air conditioners and refrigerators because the evaporators and condensers coils are smaller and lighter. MicroGroove uses a grooved inner surface of the tube to increase the <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> and increase turbulence to mix the refrigerant and homogenize temperatures across the tube.|$|E

50|$|The <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> {{of organisms}} of {{different}} sizes also leads to some observations in biogeography such as Bergmann's rule.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} cube (1m sides) has a <b>surface</b> area <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> of 6:1. The larger (2m sides) cube has a <b>surface</b> area <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> of (24/8) 3:1. As {{the dimensions}} increase, the <b>volume</b> will continue <b>to</b> grow {{faster than the}} surface area. Thus the square-cube law. This principle applies to all solids.|$|R
25|$|Problems with lipid {{fatty acid}} {{analyses}} include the incomplete specificity of fatty acids to AM fungi, the species- or genera-specific variation in fatty acid composition can complicate analysis in systems with multiple AM fungal species (e.g. field soil), the high background levels of certain fatty acid concentration in soils, and that phospholipids are correlated to an organism's membrane area, and the <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> can vary widely between organisms such as bacteria and fungi. More work {{must be done}} to identify the efficacy of this method in field soils with many genera and species of AM fungi to discern the methods ability to discriminate between many varying fatty acid compositions.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplicity}} of the Wankel engine makes it well-suited for mini, micro, and micro-mini engine designs. The Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) Rotary Engine Lab at the University of California, Berkeley, has previously undertaken research towards the development of Wankel engines of down to 1mm in diameter, with displacements less than 0.1cc. Materials include silicon and motive power includes compressed air. The goal of such research was to eventually develop an internal combustion engine {{with the ability to}} deliver 100 milliwatts of electrical power; with the engine itself serving as the rotor of the generator, with magnets built into the engine rotor itself. Development of the miniature Wankel engine stopped at UC Berkeley {{at the end of the}} DARPA contract. Miniature Wankel engines struggled to maintain compression due to sealing problems, similar to problems observed in the large scale versions. In addition, miniature engines suffer from an adverse <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> causing excess heat losses; the relatively large surface area of the combustion chamber walls transfers away what little heat is generated in the small combustion volume resulting in quenching and low efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Type IV Portland cement is {{generally}} {{known for its}} low heat of hydration. Its typical compound composition is: 28% (C3S), 49% (C2S), 4% (C3A), 12% (C4AF), 1.8% MgO, 1.9% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 0.8% free CaO. The percentages of (C2S) and (C4AF) are relatively high and (C3S) and (C3A) are relatively low. A limitation on this type is that the maximum percentage of (C3A) is seven, and the maximum percentage of (C3S) is thirty-five. This causes the heat given off by the hydration reaction to develop at a slower rate. However, as a consequence {{the strength of the}} concrete develops slowly. After one or two years the strength is higher than the other types after full curing. This cement is used for very large concrete structures, such as dams, which have a low <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio.</b> This type of cement {{is generally}} not stocked by manufacturers, but some might consider a large special order. This type of cement has not been made for many years, because Portland-pozzolan cements and ground granulated blast furnace slag addition offer a cheaper and more reliable alternative.|$|E
50|$|In warm climates, Allen's rule {{predicts that}} animals should have {{comparatively}} high <b>ratios</b> of <b>surface</b> area <b>to</b> <b>volume.</b> Because animals with low <b>surface</b> area <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> will overheat quickly, Allen's rule predicts that animals in warm climates should have high <b>surface</b> area <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> <b>to</b> maximize the <b>surface</b> area {{by which they}} dissipate heat, allowing them to dissipate more heat.|$|R
25|$|Because {{small animals}} {{necessarily}} have higher <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> than larger species of similar form, aerodynamic forces {{have a greater}} effect on them, resulting in much lower terminal velocity in free fall and amplifying the effects of even small alterations <b>to</b> body <b>surface</b> area. These small changes provide incremental benefits towards further development of gliding.|$|R

50|$|Micro-combustion is the {{sequence}} of exothermic chemical reaction between a fuel and an oxidant accompanied by the production of heat and conversion of chemical species at micro level. The release of heat can result {{in the production of}} light in the form of either glowing or a flame. Fuels of interest often include organic compounds (especially hydrocarbons) in the gas, liquid or solid phase. The major problem of micro-combustion is the high <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio.</b> As the <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> increases heat loss to walls of combustor increases which leads to flame quenching.|$|E
50|$|Micro {{combustion}} chambers are the devices in which combustion happens {{at a very}} small volume, due to which <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> increases which plays {{a vital role in}} stabilizing the flame.|$|E
50|$|With MicroGroove technology, heat {{transfer}} {{is enhanced by}} grooving the inside surface of the tube. This increases the <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio,</b> mixes the refrigerant, and homogenizes refrigerant temperatures across the tube.|$|E
30|$|Nanowires {{are unique}} for sensing {{applications}} as they exhibit high sensitivity, long-term stability, and large <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios.</b> For sensing applications, tungsten or tungsten oxide nanowires, {{are known to}} have a high sensitivity for detecting gasses such as ammonia [7, 8], nitrogen dioxide [9, 10], hydrogen sulfide [11, 12], hydrogen [6, 13], pH [5], and etc. at low parts per million and even as low as parts per billion levels.|$|R

50|$|Nanoparticles have a {{much greater}} <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> than bulk materials. The {{increased}} <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> means surface atoms {{have a much}} greater effect on chemical and physical properties of a nanoparticle. Surface atoms bind in the solid phase with less cohesive energy because they have fewer neighboring atoms in close proximity compared to atoms in {{the bulk of the}} solid. Each chemical bond an atom shares with a neighboring atom provides cohesive energy, so atoms with fewer bonds and neighboring atoms have lower cohesive energy. The average cohesive energy per atom of a nanoparticle has been theoretically calculated as a function of particle size according to Equation 1.|$|E
5000|$|Porous silicon (abbreviated as [...] "PS" [...] or [...] "pSi") {{is a form}} of the {{chemical}} element silicon that has introduced nanopores in its microstructure, rendering a large <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> in the order of 500 m2/cm3.|$|E
50|$|Because tracheids have a {{much higher}} <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> {{compared}} to vessel elements, they serve to hold water against gravity (by adhesion) when transpiration is not occurring. This is likely one mechanism that helps plants prevent air embolisms.|$|E
50|$|Closed {{systems have}} the {{advantage}} of being controllable in terms of physical, chemical and biological environment. This allows for increasing yields, and influencing the nutrient ratio of the organism. Typical forms such as tubes or polyethylene bags, also offer a larger <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> than open pond systems, thus increasing the amount of sunlight available for photosynthesis. These closed systems help expanding the growing period into the winter months, but often lead to overheating in summer.|$|R
50|$|Nanotoxicology is {{the study}} of the {{toxicity}} of nanomaterials. Because of quantum size effects and large <b>surface</b> area <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio,</b> nanomaterials have unique properties compared with their larger counterparts.|$|R
50|$|The high <b>surface</b> area <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> of {{nanoparticles}} {{may make}} them an inhalation hazard for workers exposed to them. This {{is a topic}} of ongoing research as of 2015.|$|R
50|$|Fruticose or ‘shrubby’ lichen {{differ from}} {{other forms of}} lichen based on their bushy form that is {{attached}} to the ground only {{at the base of the}} lichen. The most important difference that distinguishes fruticose lichen from other forms of lichen is the continuous algal layer that grows around the circumference of the branches of the lichen. The thallus may be either rounded or flattened, unbranched or branched. Fruticose lichens have a fine, round, hair-like structures and are loosely attached to rocks and trees. Although fruticose lichens are defined as being bushy, they can also exhibit a flattened and strap-like appearance. Highly branched fruticose lichen have a high <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> that results in a rapid drying and wetting pattern compared to lichens that have a lower <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The surface-area-to-volume ratio has {{physical}} dimension L−1 (inverse length) and {{is therefore}} expressed in units of inverse distance.

50|$|Chemical {{catalysis}} benefits {{especially from}} nanoparticles, {{due to the}} extremely large <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio.</b> The application potential of nanoparticles in catalysis ranges from fuel cell to catalytic converters and photocatalytic devices. Catalysis is also important {{for the production of}} chemicals. For example, nanoparticles with a distinct chemical surrounding (ligands), or specific optical properties.|$|E
30|$|As seen on Fig.  7, the current-voltage {{curves of}} these samples are different. For 0 D SnO 2 sample, I–V curves are non-ohmic at all {{temperatures}} while 1 D tin (IV) oxide sample {{is characterized by}} linear (ohmic) current-voltage dependences. The various nature of curves for 0 D and 1 D nanostructures related <b>to</b> the different <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios.</b> Change in this ratio leads {{to a change in}} the I–V behavior of the material. It is known that both surface and bulk conductivities of the SnO 2 contribute to the overall conductivity.|$|R

50|$|Nanocomposites are {{desirable}} for their mechanical properties. When fillers in a composite {{are at the}} nanometer length scale, the <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> of the filler material is high, which influences the bulk properties of the composite more compared to traditional composites. The properties of these nanosized elements is markedly different than that of its bulk constituent.|$|E
50|$|The {{lake was}} formed in the late 1960s {{on the site of}} the former Winton and Green Swamps, being {{completed}} in 1971. The lake has regularly suffered from serious toxic algal blooms since its creation. The large but shallow lake has a very high <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio,</b> resulting in very extensive water loss through evaporation.|$|E
50|$|As {{catalysis}} is {{a surface}} process, one particular challenge in catalytic studies is resolving the typically weak spectroscopic signal of the catalytically active surface against {{that of the}} inactive bulk structure. Moving from the micro to the nano scale increases the <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> of the particles, maximizing the signal of the surface relative {{to that of the}} bulk.|$|E

40|$|NMR relaxometry has {{developed}} into a method for rapid pore-size determination of natural porous media. Nevertheless, it is prone to uncertainties because of unknown surface relaxivities which depend mainly on the chemical composition of the pore walls {{as well as on}} the interfacial dynamics of the pore fluid. The classical approach for the determination of surface relaxivities is the scaling of NMR relaxation times by <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> measured by gas adsorption or mercury intrusion. However, it is preferable that a method for the determination of average pore sizes uses the same substance, water, as probe molecule for both relaxometry and <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> measurements. One should also ensure that in both experiments the dynamics of the probe molecule takes place on similar length scales, which are in the order of some microns. Therefore, we employed NMR diffusion measurements with different observation times using bipolar pulsed field gradients and applied them to unconsolidated sediments (two purified sands, two natural sands, and one soil). The evaluation by Mitra's short-time model for diffusion in restricted environments yielded information about the <b>surface</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> which is independent of relaxation mechanisms. We point out that methods based on NMR diffusometry yield pore dimensions and surface relaxivities consistent with a pore space as sampled by native pore fluids via the diffusion process. This opens a way to calibrate NMR relaxation measurements with other NMR techniques, providing information about the pore-size distribution of natural porous media directly from relaxometry...|$|R
