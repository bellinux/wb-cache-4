There are generally two kinds of <b>services</b> that <b>have</b> been available. Some of these <b>services</b> <b>have</b> provided counseling coupled with assisting debtors in establishing programs to pay off debts over an extended time. Others have provided consolidation and management services, in which agreements are reached with creditors to settle on a percentage of debt.

5|$|Between 1942 and 1944 {{large numbers}} of Allied service {{personnel}} were buried in the military section of Brookwood cemetery. On the authority of Thomas B. Larkin, Quartermaster General of the United States Army, 3,600 bodies of US servicemen were exhumed in January–May 1948 and shipped to the United States for reburial. The railway <b>service</b> <b>had</b> been suspended in 1941, and North station (renamed North Bar after the ending of rail services) {{was used as a}} temporary mortuary to hold these bodies while awaiting shipment to the USA.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decades of the 20th century, the Australian Government {{established}} the armed services as separate organisations. Each <b>service</b> <b>had</b> an independent chain of command. In 1976, the government made a strategic change and established the ADF to place the services under a single headquarters. Over time, the degree of integration has increased and tri-service headquarters, logistics and training institutions have supplanted many single-service establishments.|$|E

The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at £376,993,052. Two referendums on conscription for overseas <b>service</b> <b>had</b> been defeated during the war, preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force, but stretching the reserves of manpower available, particularly {{towards the end of the}} fighting. Consequently, Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war.|$|E
5|$|In late 1998 {{and early}} 1999, KLM and Braathens {{introduced}} direct flights from Sandefjord and Kristiansand to Amsterdam.

5|$|The 6.9 {{earthquake}} of 11 March 2010 occurred {{two weeks}} after the 27 February event. Chilean seismologists, including Sergio Barrientos from the University of Chile Seismological <b>Service,</b> <b>had</b> suggested that the absence of an aftershock greater than magnitude 6 following the February 27 quake indicated that there remained energy with the potential to be released. Two foreshocks of the 11 March event occurred on 5 March: one reached magnitude 5.7, and the other magnitude 5.2; both were felt between the Valparaíso and Maule regions.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 962 {{vehicles}} were produced from 1942 to 1943. It {{had originally been}} planned that Britain would receive all of the examples produced through Lend-Lease, intending to use them in the Western Desert, {{but by the time}} they arrived the campaign was over. Additionally, the purpose-built M10 tank destroyer, armed with a 3-inch gun (and later a 17-pounder gun in British <b>service)</b> <b>had</b> begun to enter production. As a result, the British transferred 650 half-tracks to the Soviet Union under the Soviet Aid Program. Britain retained 30 and the remainder were taken by the US; except for one kept by the U.S. Army, these British and American vehicles were converted back to standard M3 Half-tracks.|$|E
5|$|As the Monbar {{case and}} similar cases came to light, the GAL issue became {{increasingly}} controversial in the 1990s, with questions over whether {{members of the}} Spanish government and state security <b>service</b> <b>had</b> known about the group's operations in places like Bayonne and, if so, to what extent they had supported and funded the attacks. This became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general election with Spanish Interior Minister, José Barrionuevo, and his security chief, Rafael Vera, implicated in the GAL case. In 1998, both were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and {{misappropriation of public funds}} to finance the GAL. Along with various corruption scandals and the poor state of the Spanish economy in the mid-1990s, the GAL scandal is seen as a key factor in the PSOE defeat.|$|E

5|$|In 1869, the United States Post Office {{issued the}} first U.S. Postage stamp to depict an actual {{historic}} event, {{and the subject}} that was chosen was the Pony Express. Until then only the faces of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson {{were found on the}} face of U.S. Postage. Sometimes mistaken for an actual stamp used by the Pony Express, the 'Pony Express Stamp' issue was released in 1869 (8 years after the Pony Express <b>service</b> <b>had</b> ended) to honor the men who rode the long and sometimes dangerous journeys and to commemorate the service they provided for the nation. In 1940 and 1960 commemorative stamps were issued for the 80th and 100th anniversaries of the Pony Express respectively.|$|E

5|$|In April 1999, NSB {{launched}} a new branding scheme for their trains. In addition to Puls for local trains and Agenda for regional trains, the Signatur ("Signature") concept was introduced for intercity trains. Signatur would only be used on the Class 73 services, and consist of two classes, Comfort and Comfort Plus. NSB abolished its branding of only having red trains, and introduced a blue and silver livery on the Class 73 trains. The new <b>service</b> <b>had</b> fewer stops and faster travel times. To {{take advantage of the}} faster speeds, the Norwegian National Rail Administration needed to do upgrades to the track, overhead wires and signaling for NOK1.2 billion.|$|E

5|$|In August 2017, NYC Ferry filed {{plans to}} build four ferry docks: one in Soundview, one in Yorkville, one near Stuyvesant Cove, {{and one on the}} Lower East Side. It also sought to add two more piers to its home port at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The Soundview route was revised so that it would stop at East 34th Street instead of at East 62nd Street, which would no longer be built. That month, Brooklyn {{politicians}} called for docks to be built in Coney Island and Canarsie, owing to the new system's popularity. The Astoria route was projected to carry 1,800 daily passengers upon opening, by which point the <b>service</b> <b>had</b> seen 1.4 million riders. Due to even more ridership demand, three extra ferries were ordered in September 2017, by which time over 2 million people had ridden the ferry.|$|E

5|$|In March 1954, Air Kruise {{applied for}} {{permission}} to operate Dakotas on routes between Lympne and Le Touquet, Calais and Ostend. On 29 April, the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation offered Lympne for sale by auction in London. Bidding reached £88,000 but the reserve was £100,000 and the airport was not sold. On 28 August, Silver City Airways trialled a Westland-Sikorsky WS-51 helicopter on cross-Channel flights. Permission had been granted {{for the use of}} these aircraft for freight operations and it was intended to introduce them on 1 April 1955. On 3 October, Silver City Airways operated their last flight out of Lympne as operations were being transferred to the new Lydd (Ferryfield) Airport which had opened on 6 July 1954. A total of 33,487 car ferry flights had been made from Lympne since the <b>service</b> <b>had</b> started in 1948.

40|$|As Web <b>Services</b> <b>have</b> matured the {{interactions}} that the <b>services</b> <b>have</b> between themselves have gotten increasingly complex and sophisticated. Web services can be composed easily from other services, and these services {{can be made}} to orchestrate with each other in dynamic fashion. As web <b>services</b> <b>have</b> become dominant in the Internet and Grid systems landscape, a need to ensure guaranteed delivery of interactions (encapsulated in messages) between <b>services</b> <b>has</b> become increasingly important. In this paper we describe our work with the WSRM specification. Here we describe our support of WSRM and also include an empirical evaluation of the various facets of this specification. We believe this would be very useful for system designers who intend to incorporate support for reliable messaging within their Grid applications. 1...|$|R
