5|$|Grant's {{claims that}} Indian spiritual traditions like Tantra and Yoga {{correlate}} to Western esoteric traditions, {{and that both}} <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> core, ancient source, has parallels in the perennial philosophy promoted by the Traditionalist School of esotericists. However, Grant differed from Traditionalists like René Guénon and Ananda Coomaraswamy in his positive assessment of Western occultism. Moreover, Grant's appreciation of Asian spiritual traditions has {{much in common with}} Theosophy, although Grant differed from the Theosophical movement with his valorisation of the 'left hand path'.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the club <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> variety of groups that came {{together}} in 1876. After {{a number of years}} including banjo and mandolin players in the club, it reverted to simply a vocal group by the mid-1920s. It received a substantial rise in profile under the directory of Philip Duey in the 1950s, who organised national, then international tours, and numerous television appearances. Since then, the club has continued to tour internationally at high-profile venues.|$|E
5|$|Allen, Messori, and Plunkett also {{state that}} accusations that Opus Dei is secretive are unfounded. These accusations <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{clerical}} paradigm which expects Opus Dei members {{to behave as}} monks and clerics, people who are traditionally known and externally identifiable as seekers of holiness. In contrast, these journalists continue, Opus Dei's lay members, like any normal Catholic professional, are ultimately responsible for their personal actions, and do not externally represent the organization which provides them religious education. Writer and broadcast analyst John L. Allen, Jr. states that Opus Dei provides abundant information about itself. These journalists have stated that the historic roots of criticisms against Opus Dei {{can be found in}} influential clerical circles.|$|E

5|$|From {{the point}} of view of physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From {{the point of}} view of chemistry, a spiral can be generated by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the <b>stem.</b> <b>From</b> <b>a</b> biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|When Edward {{found out}} about Harclay's treason, he issued an order for the earl's arrest. As Harclay {{attempted}} to garner support for his cause, the king began to fortify the northern castles. The stalemate lasted until 25 February, when Sir Anthony Lucy arrested the earl at Carlisle Castle. Lucy, who acted with only a small force, was clearly trusted by Harclay, so the arrest must have been conducted as a surprise manoeuvre. The enmity between Lucy and Harclay could <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> dispute over the honour of Papcastle. In 1322, Harclay had also briefly disseised Lucy of his lands after the 1322 rebellion, even though Lucy had taken no part in that event.|$|E

25|$|Strange's {{reasons for}} {{defending}} Oliver <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> past incident where Strange {{was responsible for}} the death of Oliver's father. The character justifies his defence of the criminal by stating that he is not defending Oliver but his rights.|$|E
25|$|Some {{linguists}} {{have claimed}} that Aymara is related to its more widely spoken neighbor, Quechua. That claim, however, is disputed. Although there are indeed similarities, like the nearly-identical phonologies, the majority position among linguists today is that the similarities are better explained as areal features rising from prolonged cohabitation, rather than natural genealogical changes that would <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> common protolanguage.|$|E
25|$|Form is {{also often}} the only {{determinant}} expressed by European subjects; while color is less frequent than in American subjects, color-form responses are comparatively frequent in opposition to form-color responses; since the latter tend to be interpreted as indicators of a defensive attitude in processing affect, this difference could <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> higher value attributed to spontaneous expression of emotions.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} forming a lexical <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> root {{is known in}} general as derivational morphology, while the process of inflecting that stem is known as inflectional morphology.

25|$|In 2002, Aldo Guerreschi and Michele Salcito {{argued that}} many of these marks on the fabric of the shroud <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> much earlier time because the symmetries {{correspond}} more to the folding that would have been necessary to store the cloth in a clay jar (like cloth samples at Qumran) than to that necessary to store it in the reliquary that housed it in 1532.|$|E
25|$|Phyla are {{not covered}} by the Bacteriological code, however, the {{scientific}} community generally follows the Ncbi and Lpsn taxonomy, where the name of the phylum is generally the plural of the type genus, {{with the exception of the}} Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria, whose names do not <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> genus name. The higher taxa proposed by Cavalier-Smith are generally disregarded by the molecular phylogeny community (e.g.) (vide supra).|$|E

25|$|DMSO is {{marketed as}} an {{alternative}} medicine. Its popularity {{as an alternative}} cure is stated to <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 60 Minutes documentary featuring an early proponent. However, DMSO is an ingredient in some products listed by the U.S. FDA as fake cancer cures and the FDA has had a running battle with distributors. One such distributor is Mildred Miller, who promoted DMSO {{for a variety of}} disorders and was consequently convicted of Medicare fraud.|$|E

The umbrella is simple and has neither warabite nor an ukebana. The yunoki seems to <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> citron tree that used to stand near the lantern at Kasuga Shrine.

25|$|In their memoirs, Emilio Aguinaldo {{and other}} Magdalo people claim Bonifacio became {{the head of}} the Magdiwang, {{receiving}} the title Harì ng Bayan ("King of the People") with Mariano Álvarez as his second-in-command. However, these claims are unsupported by documentary evidence. Carlos Quirino suggests these claims <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> misunderstanding or misrepresentation of Bonifacio's title Pangulo ng Haring Bayan ("President of the Sovereign Nation"). Santiago Álvarez (son of Mariano) distinguishes between the Magdiwang government and the Katipunan Supreme Council headed by Bonifacio.|$|E

This reform {{was not part of}} the 100 equality measures promised by the Government but <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 2002 agreement between the states and territories that the previous Howard Government did not fulfill.

25|$|Although the organization's {{historic}} roots <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{system of}} fraternal lodges and {{units in the}} late 20th century, as fraternal organizations declined throughout the United States, the organization evolved into a dual system of both lodges and units. The membership pattern became more common to other contemporary organizations of members affiliated by contribution in addition to formal dues paying members. In recent years, the organization reported {{hundreds of thousands of}} members and supporters in countries around the world and a budget of $14,000,000. Nearly 95% of the membership is in the United States.|$|E

Minor traffic offenses are the starting point, and the costs spiral up rapidly if the offenders do not pay the fines on time or do not appear in court. The income from court fines represented the second largest source of revenue for Ferguson in 2013. On October 1, 2014, the city of St. Louis cancelled 220,000 arrest warrants and gave a three-month delay to the offenders {{to get a new}} court date before the warrants would be reissued.|$|E
