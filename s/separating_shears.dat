40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} on heat transfer from slightly heated circular cylinders in cross flow. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} combined influence of the scale of free-stream turbulence and the diameter of the cylinder on the rate of heat transfer at the rear stagnation point. By using a hot-wire anemometer, spectrum analysis of the anemometer signal with a Fourier analyzer is employed to investigate the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer formed behind the circular cylinder. The Nusselt number at the rear stagnation point varies with the scale ratio of turbulence and cylinder diameter, although the Reynolds number is the same. Corresponding streamwise profile of the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer is also influenced. The laminar-to-turbulent transition region moves in the streamwise direction because of a variation of the scale ratio. It was discovered that the heat transfer characteristics behind cylinders are affected by the scale ratio, and are closely related to the streamwise movement of the region of transition to turbulence in the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer...|$|R
40|$|An {{aluminum}} NACA 0018 airfoil testbed {{was constructed}} with 95 static pressure taps and 25 embedded microphones to enable novel time-resolved measurements of surface pressure. The main {{objective of this}} investigation is to utilize time-resolved surface pressure measurements to estimate salient flow characteristics in the separated flow region over the upper surface of an airfoil. The flow development over the airfoil was examined using hot wire anemometry and mean surface pressure {{for a range of}} Reynolds numbers from 80 x 103 to 200 x 103 and angles of attack from 0 ° to 18 °. For these parameters, laminar boundary layer separation takes place on the upper surface and two flow regimes occur: (i) separation is followed by flow reattachment, so that a separation bubble forms and (ii) separation occurs without subsequent reattachment. Measurements of velocity and mean surface pressure were used to characterize the separated flow region and its effect on airfoil performance using the lift coefficient. In addition, the transition process and the evolution of disturbances were examined. The lift curve characteristics were found to be linked to the rate of change of the separation, transition, and reattachment locations with the angle of attack. For both flow regimes, transition was observed in the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer. Specifically, the amplification of disturbances within a band of frequencies in the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer resulted in laminar to turbulent transition. Validation of time-resolved surface pressure measurements was performed for Rec = 100 x 103 at α = 8 ° and α = 12 °, corresponding to regimes of flow separation with and without reattachment, respectively. A comparative analysis of simultaneous velocity and time-resolved surface pressure measurements showed that the characteristics and development of velocity fluctuations associated with disturbances in the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer can be extracted from time-resolved surface pressure measurements. Specifically, within the separated flow region, the amplitude of periodic oscillations in the surface pressure signal associated with disturbances in the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer grew in the streamwise direction. In addition, the frequency at the spectral peak of the amplified disturbances in the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer was identified. Based on the results of the validation analysis, time-resolved surface pressure measurement analysis techniques were applied for a Reynolds number range from 60 x 103 to 130 x 103 and angles of attack from 6 ° to 16 °. Within the separated flow region, the streamwise growth of surface pressure fluctuations is distinctly different depending on the flow regime. Specifically, within the separation bubble, the RMS surface pressure fluctuations increase in the streamwise direction and reach a peak just upstream of the reattachment location. The observed trend is in agreement with that observed for other separating-reattaching flows on geometries such as the forward and backward facing step and splitter plate with fence. In contrast to the separation bubble formation, when the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer fails to reattach to the airfoil surface, RMS surface pressure fluctuations increase in the streamwise direction with no maximum and the amplitude is significantly lower than those observed in the separation bubble. Surface pressure signals were further examined to identify the frequency, convective velocity, and spanwise uniformity of disturbances in the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer. Specifically, for both flow regimes, the fundamental frequency and corresponding Strouhal number exhibit a power-law dependency on the Reynolds number. Based on the available data for which velocity measurements were obtained in the separated flow region, the convective velocity matched the mean velocity at the wall-normal distance corresponding to the maximum turbulence intensity. A distinct increase in the convective velocity of disturbances in the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer was found when the airfoil was stalled in comparison to that found in the separation bubble. From statistical analysis of surface pressure signals in the spanwise direction, it was found that disturbances are strongly two-dimensional in the laminar portion of the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer and become three-dimensional through the transition process...|$|R

Emphasis {{is placed on the}} influence of the diameter of the cylinder, D, on the heat transfer coefficient at the rear stagnation point. By using a hot-wire anemometer, spectrum analysis of the anemometer signal with a Fourier analyzer is eｔmployed to investigate the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer formed behind the circular cylinder. Moreover, the temperature distribution behind it is measured {{with the use of a}} resistance thermometer. The cylinders tested have a diameter of 10, 12, 14 and 18 mm. The examined region of the Reynolds number ranges from 7000 to 13000. The Nusselt number at the rear stagnation point varies with the cylinder diameter at the same Reynolds number. Corresponding <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> and thermal boundary layers are also influenced. The laminar-to-turbulent transition region moves in the streamwise direction due to a variation in D. It was found that heat transfer from cylinder is affected by the cylinder size, and is closely related with the streamwize movement of the transition region of laminar tp turbulence in the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} leading edge flaps on the {{aerodynamic}} {{characteristics of a}} low aspect-ratio delta wing are studied theoretically. As {{an extension of the}} classical crossflow plane analysis and in order to include <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layers, an analogy between three dimensional steady conical and two dimensional unsteady self-similar flows is explored. This analogy provides a simple steady-unsteady relationship. The criteria for the validity of the steady-unsteady analogy are also examined. Two different theoretical techniques are used to represent the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layers based on the steady-unsteady analogy, neglecting the trailing edge effect. In the first approach, each vortex system is represented by a pair of concentrated vortices connected to the separation points by straight feeding sheets. In the second approach, the vortex cloud method is adopted for simulating the flow field in the crossflow plane. The <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layers are replaced with a cloud of discrete vortices and the boundary element method is employed to represent the wing trace by a vorticity distribution.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was made on}} heat transfer and flow characteristics behind circular cylinders with three different sizes, 10 mm, 12 mm and 14 mm in diameter, under lower freestream turbulence. The Nusselt number obtained, when the Reynolds number was kept a constant value, increased as the cylinder diameter became larger. Moreover, experimental results showed that for the relatively large cylinder case (D= 12 mm), the laminar-to-turbulent transition region in the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer was shifted in the upstreamwise direction {{with an increase in}} the Reynolds number, while the transition of larger cylinder (D= 14 mm) was observed in the early stage.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} a laminar separation bubble on the leading-edge of a modelled aerofoil for different Reynolds numbers A Samson and S Sarkar This paper describes the dynamics of a laminar separation bubble formed on the semi-circular leading edge of constant thickness aerofoil model. Detailed experimental studies are carried out in a low-speed wind tunnel, where surface pressure and time-averaged velocity in the separated region and {{as well as in}} the downstream are presented along with flow field visualisations through PIV for various Reynolds numbers ranging from 25, 000 to 75, 000 (based on the leading edge diameter). The results illustrate that the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer is laminar up to 20 % of separation length and then the perturbations are amplified in the second half attributing to breakdown and reattachment. The bubble length is highly susceptible to change in Reynolds number and plays an important role in outer layer activities. Further, the transition of a <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer is studied through variation of intermittency factor and comparing with existing correlations available in the literature for attached flow and as well as separated flow. Transition of the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer occurs through formation of K-H rolls, where the intermittency following spot propagation theory appears valid. The predominant shedding frequency when normalised with respect to the momentum thickness at separation remains almost constant with change in Reynolds number. The relaxation is slow after reattachment and the flow takes about five bubble lengths to approach a canonical layer...|$|R
40|$|Cavitation is {{observed}} in a convergent-divergent nozzle using a high speed video camera. For this kind of flow, the cavitation has unsteady character with periodic shedding of cavitation clouds. The periodicity is accompanied with a re-entrant motion, the growth of vortex cavity on the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer {{as well as the}} shedding of a large-scale cavitation cloud. In this process, the formation of attached cavity is repeated with shedding of cavitation clouds. The switching mechanism from the re-entrant motion to the formation of shedding cavitation clouds has not been fully understood. In the present study, it is shown in details by experimental results based on high speed video observations that one of the mechanisms is the leading-edge bubble collapse in the separated region to interrupt continuous supply of vorticity from upstream boundary layer and the formation of micro-vortex cavities on the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to clarify flow and heat {{transfer}} characteristics behind circular cylinders. Our main attention is focused on the examination of the validity of heat transfer correlations, which have already been proposed by serveral authors. Heat transfer at the rear stagnation point and streamwise velocity were measured under the condition that free-stream turbulence and blockage factor are maintained considerably lower level. The examined range of the Reynolds number was from 7000 to 22000. In the relatively high Reynolds number heat transfer coefficients are predicted by means of the existing correlations, while their prediction accuracy is insufficient in lower Reynolds number cases. A corresponding experimental result of the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer shows that the laminar-to-turbulent transition region is shifted in the upstreamwise direction, as the Reynolds number increases. It was found, therefore, that the transition of the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer has a significant effect on the heat transfer behavior...|$|R

For all cases, the Reynolds number based on step height was greater than 20, 000, the expansion ratio was 5 / 3, and the inlet boundary layer was less than one-half step height in thickness. A crucially important phase was the development of a pulsed wall probe for measurement of skin friction in the reattachment region, thus providing an unambiguous definition of the reattachment length. Quantitative features of reattachment - including streamwise development of the mean and fluctuating velocity field, pressure rise, and skin friction - were found to be similar for all cases studied when scaled by the reattachment length.

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} the flow field around a NACA 0012 airfoil at Reynolds number 50 000 and angle of attack 5 ° with 3 different trailing edge shapes (straight, blunt, and serrated) have been performed. Both time-averaged flow characteristics and the most dominant flow structures and their frequencies are investigated using the dynamic mode decomposition method. It is shown that for the straight trailing edge airfoil, this method can capture the fundamental {{as well as the}} subharmonic of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that develops naturally in the <b>separating</b> <b>shear</b> layer. The fundamental frequency matches well with relevant data in the literature. The blunt trailing edge results in periodic vortex shedding, with frequency close to the subharmonic of the natural shear layer frequency. The shedding, resulting from a global instability, has an upstream effect and forces the <b>separating</b> <b>shear</b> layer. Due to forcing, the shear layer frequency locks onto the shedding frequency while the natural frequency (and its subharmonic) is suppressed. The presence of serrations in the trailing edge creates a spanwise pressure gradient, which is responsible {{for the development of a}} secondary flow pattern in the spanwise direction. This pattern affects the mean flow in the near wake. It can explain an unexpected observation, namely, that the velocity deficit downstream of a trough is smaller than the deficit after a protrusion. Furthermore, the insertion of serrations attenuates the energy of vortex shedding by de-correlating the spanwise coherence of the vortices. This results in weaker forcing of the <b>separating</b> <b>shear</b> layer, and both the subharmonics of the natural frequency and the shedding frequency appear in the spectra...|$|R

Although the fluid motion under the solitary wave is only translatory, vortices are shed in both the upstream and downstream directions due to the interaction of the generated vortices as well as the vortices with the plate and the bottom.

Results were detailed enough to allow calculating laminar and turbulent deformation works in the separated flow region. Normal and shear contributions of both viscous and turbulent deformation works have been analyzed and employed to explain the generation of total pressure losses in the separated flow region, where the generation and amplification of Kelvin–Helmholtz instability induces the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer roll-up, thus the bubble reattachment.

By evaluating the existing models for the pressure-strain correlation, better coefficients are obtained for the prediction of <b>separating</b> <b>shear</b> flows. Furthermore, the diffusion rate of the Reynolds stresses is reevaluated adopting several algebraic correlations for the triple-velocity products. The models of Cormack et al., Daly-Harlow, Hanjalic-Launder, and Shir were tested for the reattaching shear flows. It was generally observed that all these algebraic models give considerably low values of the triple-velocity products. This is attributed {{to the fact that}} none of the algebraic models can take the convective effect of the triple-velocity products into account in the <b>separating</b> <b>shear</b> flows, thus resulting in much lower diffusion rate than Reynolds stresses.

40|$|The {{later stages}} of <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer {{transition}} within separation bubbles developing over a NACA 0018 airfoil operating at a chord Reynolds number of 105 and at angles of attack of 0, 5, 8, and 10 degrees were investigated experimentally in a wind tunnel. Several experimental tools, including a rake of six boundary-layer hot-wire anemometers, {{were used to}} perform measurements over the model. Novel high-speed flow visualization performed with a smoke-wire placed within the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer showed that roll-up vortices are shed within separation bubbles forming on the suction side of the airfoil. The structures were found to convect downstream and eventually break down during laminar-to-turbulent transition. Top view visualizations revealed that, at angles of attack of 0, 5, and 8 degrees, roll-up vortices form coherently across the span and undergo significant spanwise deformations prior to breaking down. At angles of attack of 5 and 8 degrees, rows of streamwise-oriented structures were observed to form during vortex breakdown. Statistics regarding the formation and development of shear layer roll-up vortices were extracted from high-speed flow visualization sequences and compared {{to the results of}} boundary layer measurements. It was found that, on the average, roll-up vortices form following the initial exponential growth of unstable disturbances within the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer and initiate the later stages of transition. The onset of these nonlinear stages was found to occur when the amplitude of velocity disturbances reached approximately 10 % of the free-stream velocity. The rate of vortex shedding was found to fall within the frequency band of the unstable disturbances and lie near the central frequency of this band. The formation of vortices has been linked to the generation of harmonics of these unstable disturbances in velocity signals acquired ahead of mean transition. Once shed, vortices were found to drift at speeds between 33 % and 44 % of the edge velocity. Vortex merging at an angle of attack of 5 ° was investigated. It was found that the majority of roll-up vortices proceed to merge with either one or two other vortices. Vortex merging between two and three vortices was found to occur periodically in a process similar to vortex merging in plane mixing layers undergoing subharmonic forcing of the most amplified disturbance. The flapping motion of the <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer was investigated by performing a cross-correlation analysis on the high-speed flow visualization sequences to extract vertical displacement signals of the smoke within the shear layer. The frequency of flapping was found to correspond to the unstable disturbance band. At an angle of attack of 5 °, {{it was found that the}} <b>separated</b> <b>shear</b> layer has a low-frequency component of flapping that matches a strong peak in velocity and surface pressure spectra that lies outside the unstable disturbance frequency band. The spanwise development of disturbances was assessed in the aft portion of the separation bubbles by performing a cross-correlation analysis on signals acquired simultaneously across the span with the rake of hot-wires. The spanwise correlations between signals was found to be well-correlated ahead of shear layer roll-up, after which disturbances became rapidly uncorrelated ahead of mean reattachment. These results were found to be linked to the coherent roll-up and subsequent breakdown of roll-up vortices...|$|R
