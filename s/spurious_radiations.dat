40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a novel dual planar {{electromagnetic}} bandgap (DP-EBG) microstrip structure is investigated {{to suppress the}} spurious radiation of the patch antenna. It is demonstrated that the proposed structure achieves a ultra-wide stopband and excellent passband performance within a compact circuit area. Utilizing such special features, two units of the DP-EBG structure are employed in the feed line of patch antenna {{with the aim of}} suppressing harmonics and other spurious modes. The calculated and experimental results all verify that the application of this DP-EBG structure not only drastically diminishes <b>spurious</b> <b>radiations</b> of 2 nd ∼ 6 th harmonics in a broad frequency band, but also overcomes some shortages of other EBG microstrip antennas introduced in previous research such as large back radiation or beam squint. Besides that, by adjusting the separation between the DP-EBG structure constructed in the feed line and the patch’s bottom edge in a moderate distance, the procedure for designing the EBG patch antenna working on a certain frequency with the goal of reducing spurious radiation is simplified. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{investigation}} into how sensitive the last orbits and merger of binary black hole systems are {{to the presence of}} <b>spurious</b> <b>radiation</b> in the initial data. Our numerical experiments consist of a binary black hole system starting the last couple of orbits before merger with additional <b>spurious</b> <b>radiation</b> centered at the origin and fixed initial angular momentum. As the energy in the added <b>spurious</b> <b>radiation</b> increases, the binary is invariably hardened for the cases we tested, i. e. the merger of the two black holes is hastened. The change in merger time becomes significant when the additional energy provided by the <b>spurious</b> <b>radiation</b> increases the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass of the spacetime by about 1 %. While the final masses of the black holes increase due to partial absorption of the radiation, the final spins remain constant to within our numerical accuracy.

Aperture-Coupled Microstrip patch antenna [1],[2] has numerous advantages which include shielding of antenna from <b>spurious</b> feed <b>radiation,</b> use of suitable substrates for antenna and feed separately {{and use of}} thick antenna substrates of very low dielectric constant for increasing antenna bandwidth. To the best of authors knowledge the dielectric constant of the substrate of the feed lines {{as reported in the}} literature is of the order of 3 - 4.

40|$|Standard {{puncture}} {{initial data}} {{have been widely}} used for numerical binary black hole evolutions despite their shortcomings, most notably the inherent lack of gravitational radiation at the initial time that is later followed by a burst of <b>spurious</b> <b>radiation.</b> We study the evolution of three alternative initial data schemes. Two of the three alternatives are based on post-Newtonian expansions that contain realistic gravitational waves. The first scheme is based on a second-order post-Newtonian expansion in Arnowitt, Deser, and Misner transverse-traceless (ADMTT) gauge that has been resummed to approach standard puncture data at the black holes. The second scheme is based on asymptotic matching of the 4 -metrics of two tidally perturbed Schwarzschild solutions to a first-order post-Newtonian expansion in ADMTT gauge away from the black holes. The final alternative is obtained through asymptotic matching of the 4 -metrics of two tidally perturbed Schwarzschild solutions to a second-order post-Newtonian expansion in harmonic gauge away from the black holes. When evolved, the second scheme fails to produce quasicircular orbits (and instead leads to a nearly head-on collision). This failure {{can be traced back to}} inaccuracies in the extrinsic curvature due to low order matching. More encouraging is that the latter two alternatives lead to quasicircular orbits and show gravitational radiation from the onset of the evolution, as well as a reduction of <b>spurious</b> <b>radiation.</b> Current deficiencies compared to standard punctures data include more eccentric trajectories during the inspiral and larger constraint violations, since the alternative data sets are only approximate solutions of Einstein's equations. The eccentricity problem can be ameliorated by adjusting the initial momentum parameters.
