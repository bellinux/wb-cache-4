50|$|The Newham Fire Brigade is crewed {{exclusively}} by volunteers raised from {{a community of}} approximately 300 households.

50|$|Such suits (level A in the US) are gas or vapor-tight, {{providing}} total encapsulation and {{the highest}} level of protection against direct and airborne chemical contact. They are typically worn with a <b>self-contained</b> <b>breathing</b> apparatus (SCBA) enclosed within the suit.|$|R
5000|$|The PASS {{device is}} {{normally}} {{used in conjunction}} with breathing apparatus; it is a small, battery powered device attached to the <b>self-contained</b> <b>breathing</b> apparatus (SCBA) harness which enables the firefighter to summon help by activating a loud, piercing electronic bleeper.|$|R

50|$|The suit's {{primary air}} supply comes through a hose {{connection}} to purified air; a <b>self-contained</b> <b>breathing</b> apparatus provides 8 to 10 minutes of escape air {{in case the}} primary supply is disrupted. A heart monitor around the wearer's chest checks for signs of distress.|$|R
50|$|During Week Six, {{recruits}} learn shipboard {{damage control}} and firefighting skills. Recruits {{will learn to}} escape smoke-filled compartments, open and close watertight doors, use <b>self-contained</b> <b>breathing</b> apparatus (SCBAs), carry fire hoses, and learn to extinguish fires. Week Six also includes the Confidence Chamber (tear gas chamber).|$|R
50|$|A <b>self-contained</b> <b>breathing</b> {{apparatus}} (SCBA) {{sometimes referred}} to as a compressed air breathing apparatus (CABA), or simply breathing apparatus (BA), is a device worn by rescue workers, firefighters, and others to provide breathable air in an immediately dangerous to life or health atmosphere (IDLH). When not used underwater, they are sometimes called industrial breathing sets. The term self-contained means that the breathing set is not dependent on a remote supply (e.g., through a long hose). If designed for use under water, it is called SCUBA (<b>self-contained</b> underwater <b>breathing</b> apparatus).|$|R
50|$|Even {{though the}} FS 49 C2 gas itself doesn't leave {{dangerous}} gasses after being released into air {{it is recommended}} to use a SCBA - <b>Self-contained</b> <b>breathing</b> apparatus when entering a room after a fire because after a fire process it will release different potential harmful gasses into the air.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the major}} hazards {{associated}} with firefighting operations is the toxic environment created by combustible materials, the four major risks are smoke, oxygen deficiency, elevated temperatures, and poisonous atmospheres. Additional hazards include falls and structural collapse that can exacerbate the problems entailed in a toxic environment. To combat some of these risks, firefighters carry <b>self-contained</b> <b>breathing</b> equipment.|$|R
5000|$|At its peak, {{the fire}} was fought by more than 50 firefighters using more than 20 pieces of equipment. Five firefighters would be injured by smoke {{inhalation}} before {{the fire was}} declared out. [...] At the time, the wearing of <b>self-contained</b> <b>breathing</b> apparatus (SCBA) was a relatively new practice and not as common among firefighters as it is today.|$|R

5|$|The {{history of}} breath-hold diving goes {{back at least}} to {{classical}} times, and there is evidence of prehistoric hunting and gathering of seafoods that may have involved underwater swimming. Technical advances allowing the provision of breathing gas to a diver underwater at ambient pressure are recent, and <b>self-contained</b> <b>breathing</b> systems developed at an accelerated rate following the Second World War.|$|R
