5|$|Word of the Gold Rush spread <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> <b>first.</b> The {{earliest}} gold-seekers {{were people}} who lived near California or people who heard the news from ships on the fastest sailing routes from California. The first large group of Americans to arrive were several thousand Oregonians who came down the Siskiyou Trail. Next came people from the Sandwich Islands, and several thousand Latin Americans, including people from Mexico, from Peru and {{from as far away}} as Chile, both by ship and overland. By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.|$|E
5|$|The article {{explains}} {{the sequence of}} events of this August 4 New York City demonstration flight of 1895. When the reporter was all positioned and ready in the sky-cycle he gave word to the ground crew {{to let go of the}} ropes that held the hydrogen balloon back and it immediately lifted the sky-cycle into the air. The airship drifted up <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> going towards the factory roof peaks. The driver-reporter immediately dropped one of the sandbag weights and the sky-cycle airship rose up sharply, avoiding the building roofs. When the airship was about a thousand feet high the attached balloon propeller revolved and the sky-cycle airship flew over the East River. The steamships and tugs that spotted the sky-cycle floating above tooted their whistles.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason why}} the piano spread <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> {{was that it was}} quite {{expensive}} to make, and thus was purchased only by royalty and a few wealthy private individuals. The ultimate success of Cristofori's invention occurred only in the 1760s, when the invention of cheaper square pianos, along with generally greater prosperity, made it possible for many people to acquire one.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{from five}} group {{inactive}} mailing list members in July 2003, tPON grew <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> <b>first.</b> But {{when some of}} the members attended the A Long Expected Party: the Second Philippine Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention in 2004, things began to heat up. New members came in, exciting discussions popped up, and the Filipino C.S. Lewis community grew. Since then, the annual New Worlds convention has become a sort of time-marker for the organization, signifying steps in the organization's history.|$|E
25|$|With a Bourbon monarchy came a {{repertory}} of Bourbon mercantilist ideas {{based on}} a centralized state, put into effect in America <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> but with increasing momentum during the century. Shipping grew rapidly from the mid-1740s until the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), reflecting in part {{the success of the}} Bourbons in bringing illicit trade under control. With the loosening of trade controls after the Seven Years' War, shipping trade within the empire once again began to expand, reaching an extraordinary rate of growth in the 1780s.|$|E
25|$|The Australian captain Allan Border came to {{the crease}} and <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> but then with {{gathering}} momentum, he went about restoring the Australian innings alongside Mark Taylor, {{who appeared to be}} growing in confidence as the day went on. By the third session they had added 120 before Border mis-timed and was caught out for a determined 66. Australia had reached a healthy 174 for 3. Dean Jones joined Mark Taylor and the pair added a further 33 to see Australia at 207 for 3 at stumps on day one, with Taylor having batted the whole day not out on 96.|$|E

60|$|In {{spite of}} their utmost efforts, Mr. Hardy's party had made slower {{progress}} than they had anticipated. Many of the horses had broken down under fatigue; and as they had no spare horses to replace them, as the Indians had in like case done from those they had driven off from Mr. Mercer, {{they were forced to}} travel far more <b>slowly</b> than <b>at</b> <b>first.</b> They gained upon the Indians, however, as they could tell by the position of the camping-ground for the night.|$|R
60|$|The {{difficulty}} {{in life is}} to bring experience to the level of expectation, to match our real emotions in view of any great occasion with the ideal emotions which we have taught ourselves that we ought to feel. This is all the truer when the occasion is tragical: we surprise ourselves in a helplessness to which the great event, death, ruin, lost love, reveals itself <b>slowly,</b> and <b>at</b> <b>first</b> wears the aspect of an unbroken continuance of what has been, or at most of another incident in the habitual sequence.|$|R
25|$|The Mali Empire {{has enjoyed}} {{virtually}} no military reverses {{in its first}} century of existence and had grown at a terrific rate in both size and wealth by the time Ibn Battuta arrived there. However this wealth and power {{may have been the}} reason behind more aggressive attacks by its neighbors as well as the complacency of some of the mansas in dealing with them. Subject peoples on the fringes of the empire slowly began to shake off the yoke of Mandinka hegemony. This happened <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> but after 1450 the empire would begin to crumble very rapidly.|$|E
25|$|England were {{dismissed}} just before tea, so the interval was taken early and Ian Redpath and Ian Chappell {{came out to}} open as Rick McCoster was still dazed from his injury, having fielded {{for only a few}} overs in the morning before he had to retire again. Chappell was caught by David Lloyd close to the ground off Willis, but there no immediate appeal as Lloyd had hurt his bruised fingers and left to have then tended when the Australian captain was given out. This brought in his brother Greg Chappell at 15/1 and he added 108 runs with Redpath {{by the end of the}} day, with 100 runs coming in 110 minutes. Resuming on 123/1 Redpath and Chappell took their partnership to 220 runs, a record for Australia against England in Australia, beating the 216 made by Bill Woodfull and Hunter Hendry back in 1928–29. These came <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> as Edrich set defensive filed and Arnold and Willis bowled accurately for the first 90 minutes. However, when they were replaced by Underwood, Titmus and Greig, Chappell increased the run-rate and when Willis returned the Queensland captain took 13 runs off one over. He made his first century of the series, 1,000 run of the season and was dropped on 136 by Underwood at deep fine-leg with The Hill braying behind him. He was out for 144 trying to hit Arnold for six and skying the ball to Lloyd at mid-wicket. Chappell had now made 122, 51, 58, 71, 62, 2, 61, 44, 84 and 144 against the tourists in the season, including the Queensland vs MCC match and the One Day International. Walters came in and tried to impress his fans with another Perth-like run feast, but tried to hit Underwood across the line and was bowled for 5. With the sluggish Redpath now setting the pace and England trying to delay the declaration the game drifted, but the opener was out for 105 in 344 minutes when he uncharacteristically hit out at Underwood (2/65) and was caught by the substitute Chris Old. A few runs late Marsh was nearly run out and hurried off to the pavilion as Australia declared at 289/4, leaving England 400 runs to win in 500 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Eisner {{began his}} comic book career in 1936 and had long held artistic ambitions {{for what was}} {{perceived}} as a lowbrow medium. [...] He found no support for his ideas, and left the world of commercial comics after ending his signature work The Spirit in 1952. [...] The growth of comics fandom convinced him to return in the 1970s, and he worked to realize his aspirations of creating comics with literary content. [...] He wanted a mainstream publisher for the book and to have it sold in traditional bookstores, rather than in comic book shops; the small press Baronet Books released A Contract with God in 1978 and marketed it as a [...] "graphic novel", which thereafter became the common term for book-length comics. [...] It sold <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> but gained respect from Eisner's peers, and since has been reprinted by larger publishers. [...] A Contract with God cemented Eisner's reputation as an elder statesman of comics, and he continued to produce graphic novels and theoretical works on comics until his death in 2005.|$|E

50|$|New Jersey's {{renewable}} portfolio standard (RPS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} aggressive in the United States and requires each electricity supplier/provider to provide 22.5% from renewable energy sources by 2021. In addition, 2.12% must come from solar electricity, an amount estimated to be 1,500 megawatts (MW). Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs) must be purchased by electricity suppliers to meet the state targets or else they face a fine known as a Solar Alternative Compliance Payment (SACP) that was $0.691/kWh in 2010. As New Jersey was approaching the minimum requirements, the requirements were accelerated on July 23, 2012, changing the shape of the compliance curve from <b>slowly</b> increasing <b>at</b> <b>first</b> to rapidly increasing <b>at</b> <b>first.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{affiliation}} of many Congressmen in {{the earliest}} years is an assignment by later historians. The parties were <b>slowly</b> coalescing groups; <b>at</b> <b>first</b> there were many independents. Cunningham noted that only {{about a quarter of}} the House of Representatives, up until 1794, voted with Madison as much as two-thirds of the time, and another quarter against him two-thirds of the time, leaving almost half as fairly independent.|$|R
500|$|The 5th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade), {{meanwhile}} {{had reached}} [...] north of Ziza at 10:30, where an Ottoman officer delivered {{a letter from}} the commander of the II Corps. The 5th Light Horse regimental commander was informed at 11:40 by 2nd Light Horse Brigade headquarters that, unless the Ottoman force surrendered, they would be bombed at 15:00. Negotiations for a surrender began at 11:45, and the 5th Light Horse Regiment moved across the railway to within [...] of the Ottoman force, which was surrounded by Bedouin. Reports were received by 12:45 that the Ottoman force at Ziza would surrender, and the bombing raid was cancelled. The remainder of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade was ordered to [...] "make a forced march" [...] from Amman to Ziza, and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was ordered to follow at dawn the next day. The 7th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) arrived at Ziza late in the afternoon. The remainder of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, less details and patrols, left Amman at 13:45. They moved <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> through hilly and stony country between Amman and Leban, then trotted to Ziza, where they arrived at 17:20. The Bedouin force which surrounded the Ottoman II Corps were Beni Sakhr Bedouin Arabs. They demanded that the Ottoman force be handed over to them. This was refused, and after the arrival of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, the Beni Sakhr force became openly hostile.|$|E

5|$|When Ronald Reagan's {{administration}} {{took power}} in 1981, the export restrictions {{put in place}} by the Carter administration were <b>slowly</b> relaxed. <b>At</b> <b>first,</b> the FX program continued as normal, but a number of events eroded the value of the program and limit the F-5G's potential sales. The signing of the 1982 US-PRC Joint Communiqué was a major agreement on arms sales, which continued blocking sales of the F-5G to Taiwan. By this point the Taiwanese had started their own light-fighter project, the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo. In signing the Communiqué, the U.S. was signaling that Taiwan would not receive modern aircraft, therefore the Ching-kuo became Taiwan's primary focus. As a result, the F-5G's sales potential remained unestablished.|$|R
30|$|In Fig. 11, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} with the {{increase}} of row space from 1200  mm to 2400  mm, the settlement and the maximum lateral displacement of retaining piles <b>slowly</b> increase <b>at</b> <b>first</b> then decrease slightly, and the variation is very small. It is indicated that the row space of quincunx double-row piles has a little influence on the settlement around the excavation and the lateral displacement of retaining piles than pile diameter and pile space. With the increase of pile space from 1200  mm to 3600  mm, the settlement and the maximum lateral displacement of retaining piles increase, and the change of pile space has a very obvious influence on the lateral displacement of retaining piles.|$|R

2500|$|As {{the skill}} set {{of those in}} the {{ambulance}} increased, so did the importance of information. [...] Ambulance service moved from 'first come...first served' or giving priority to whoever sounded the most panicked, to {{trying to figure out what}} was actually happening, and the assignment of resources by priority of need. [...] This occurred <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> with local initiatives and full-time ambulance dispatchers making best guesses. [...] Priority codes developed for ambulance dispatch, and became commonplace, although they have never been fully standardized. [...] As it became possible for those in the ambulance to actually save lives, the process of sending the closest appropriate resource to the person in the greatest need became very important. Dispatchers needed tools to help them make the correct decisions, and a number of products initially competed to provide that decision-support.|$|E
2500|$|The {{viscosity}} {{of honey}} is affected greatly by both temperature and water content. The higher the water percentage, the more easily honey flows. Above its melting point, however, water has {{little effect on}} viscosity. Aside from water content, the composition of honey also has little effect on viscosity, {{with the exception of}} a few types. At , honey with 14% water content generally has a viscosity around 400 poise, while a honey containing 20% water has a viscosity around 20 poise. Viscosity increase due to temperature occurs very <b>slowly</b> <b>at</b> <b>first.</b> A honey containing 16% water, at , has a viscosity around 2 poise, while at , the viscosity is around 70 poise.

50|$|Salamanders have thin {{skins and}} soft bodies, and move rather <b>slowly,</b> and <b>at</b> <b>first</b> sight {{might appear to}} be {{vulnerable}} to opportunistic predation. However, they have several effective lines of defense. Mucus coating on damp skin makes them difficult to grasp, and the slimy coating may have an offensive taste or be toxic. When attacked by a predator, a salamander may position itself to make the main poison glands face the aggressor. Often, these are on the tail, which may be waggled or turned up and arched over the animal's back. The sacrifice of the tail may be a worthwhile strategy, if the salamander escapes with its life and the predator learns to avoid that species of salamander in future.|$|R
