50|$|At {{the bottom}} of the {{continental}} slope, one will find the continental rise, an underwater hill composed of tons of accumulated sediments. The general slope of the continental rise is between 0.5 degrees and 1.0 degrees. Deposition of sediments at the mouth of submarine canyons may form enormous fan-shaped accumulations called <b>submarine</b> <b>fans.</b> <b>Submarine</b> <b>fans</b> form part of the continental rise. Beyond the continental rise stretches the abyssal plain, an extremely deep and flat area of the sea floor. The abyssal plain hosts many unique life forms which are uniquely adapted to survival in its cold, high pressure, and dark conditions. The flatness of the abyssal plain is interrupted by massive underwater mountain chains near the tectonic boundaries of the Earth's plates.The sediments are mostly sand and pieces of coral or rock.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The Lillehammer <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex {{is a mixed}} mud/sand rich turbidite fan system. The fan complex was {{deposited}} in the Neoproterozoic Hedmark rift basin from west towards east extending at least 50 km from the basin margin. A detailed sedimentary study of outcrops in the Lillehammer area is performed {{with the aim of}} analyzing the depositional environment as an analogue for subsurface turbidite systems. Seven sedimentary logs cover a nearly 1000 meter thick stratigraphic section. Seven facies have been organized into seven facies associations, representing architectural elements including basin plain-thin bedded turbidites, basin plain-hemipelagic shale, lobe, lobe-channel, basin floor channel infill, major channel and channel-levee. The Lillehammer <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex represents two or three fan systems, separated by hemipelagic black shale or thick unit of homogenous shale that may indicate rise in relative sea level. The overall system is progradational and represents an outer and middle to inner fan environment. The main factors controlling the development of the Lillehammer <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex are thought to be tectonic activity at the basin margin and sediment influx. Comparison of the Lillehammer <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex with the Upper Cretaceous fans in the Vøring Basin reveals a good geometrical resemblance despite large differences in sandstone petrography and clay matrix content. The petrographic more impure and clay-rich sandstones of the Lillehammer <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex, as compared with those in the Vøring Basin, is interpreted to be related to differences in provenance and basin structure. Synthetic seismograms were performed for a 400 meter thick logged section to discuss the differences in seismic resolution under 1500 meter of overload and 3500 meter of overload. Only half of the seismic events are shown in the deepest model compared to the shallow model. Reflections associated with most interfaces are recognizable, but difficult to distinguish from each other. The shallow model reveals good seismic resolution of two fans separated by a thick layer of homogenous shale. The same model under a thicker overload does not have the same obvious trends, but is recognizable when you know what to expect...|$|R
50|$|Abyssal fans, {{also known}} as deep-sea fans, {{underwater}} deltas, and <b>submarine</b> <b>fans,</b> are underwater geological structures associated with large-scale sediment deposition and formed by turbidity currents. They {{can be thought of}} as an underwater version of alluvial fans and can vary dramatically in size, with widths from several kilometres to several thousands of kilometres (see Bengal Fan).|$|E

40|$|The Imsdalen <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex is {{a gravel}} and coarse sand {{dominated}} turbidite fan system. The fan complex was {{deposited in the}} Neoproterozoic Hedmark rift basin close to a basin margin bordered by the Imsdalen Fault. The Imsdalen Fault {{is supposed to be}} inherited from a syn-sedimentary strike-slip fault zone that was reactivated during the Caledonian nappe emplacement. Ten sedimentary logs cover a stratigraphic section more than 4 km thick. Thirteen facies have been organized into five facies associations, representing architectural elements including base-of-slope to upper fan feeder channel complex, upper fan distributary channel complex, middle to lower fan channel-lobe complex, fringed sheets, and fi ne-grained overbank and basin-plain deposits. The Imsdalen <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex is divided into eleven fan systems, separated by erosional surfaces, interpreted as sequence boundaries, except for the boundary at the base of fan 6, interpreted to be a maximum fl ooding surface. Overall, the eleven fan systems form a turbidite succession that records a long history of aggradation to retrogradation, as shown by the fans 1 to 8, followed by a phase of marked progradation, displayed by the fans 9 to 11, from middle to lower, to upper fan positions. It is suggested that the main factor in control of the development of the Imsdalen <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex was related to fault activity at the basin margin and sediment supply. The Imsdalen <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex shows that gravity fl ow processes have the capacity and competence to transport huge amounts of coarse sand and gravel at least 40 to 60 kilometres into a deep-marine basin. The long transport distance of the coarse-clastic material is interpreted {{as a result of the}} combined effects of very high rates of coarseclastic sediment supply, high potential energy along the submarine slope, high slope gradient, creation of accommodation due to high rate of basin subsidence, channelized transport, and effective mechanisms of clast support in the gravity fl ow system. These observations suggest that the high and low effi ciency concept of <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> systems, as a function of grain size distribution of the available sediment should be modifi ed...|$|R

50|$|The {{rocks in}} Great Valley Sequence are largely shale {{deposited}} in a deep-marine setting with thick bodies of sandstone and minor conglomerate that represent ancient deep-sea <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> and submarine canyons. Individual sandstone beds within these fans and canyons are typically turbidites and related sediment gravity flow deposits, {{such as the}} chaotic, often coarse-grained deposits of submarine mudflows. By contrast, the shales represent clay that was originally suspended {{in the water column}} and slowly settled out on the deep ocean floor. Thus, the mudstones represent background sedimentation that took place continuously, whereas the turbidites and mudflow deposits, by and large, represent sudden events.|$|E
50|$|The Fossil Bluff Group, which {{outcrops}} within Alexander Island, {{provides a}} detailed record, which includes paleosols and fossil plants, of Middle Cretaceous (Albian) terrestrial climates.

30|$|Different {{from the}} Huangliu Formation axial channel sandstone, {{drilling}} {{results indicate that}} the heavy mineral assemblages of the Meishan Formation in the Ledong and Lingshui sags display the magmatic components characteristics. It means that the provenance of the Meishan Formation sediments was mainly from the Ningyuan River and Lingshui River, which originated from the southwestern Wuzhi Mountain in the Hainan uplift. Because of regional sea level falling sharply in 13.8  Ma (Pang et al. 2005), terrigenous clastic sediments carried by these rivers were transported from the northern slope break of the Ledong and Lingshui sags, resulting in <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> deposits (Xie et al. 2016). In addition, the southwestern slope break of the Ledong sag might be another source area of the Meishan <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> (Zuo et al. 2015), although there is not enough seismic data to confirm it.|$|R

50|$|All of the Spraberry Trend {{oil fields}} produce {{from a single}} {{enormous}} sedimentary unit known as the Spraberry Sand, which consists of complexly mixed fine sandstone and calcareous or silicate mudstone and siltstone, deposited in a deep water environment distinguished by channel systems and their associated <b>submarine</b> <b>fans,</b> all of Permian age. The sands are interbedded with shales, and typically pinch-out updip. Unlike many of the oil-bearing rocks of West Texas, however, the Spraberry Sands have very low porosity and permeability, both of which hamper oil recovery. The rocks are naturally fractured, further complicating hydrocarbon flow. Oil has accumulated in stratigraphic traps, migrating upward from source rocks until encountering impermeable barriers, either in the internal shaly members or the overlying impermeable formation.|$|E
5000|$|Bedrock {{throughout}} most of the Vaca Mountains are sedimentary rocks of the Great Valley Sequence that are Cretaceous in age (65-145 ma).

There is also minor conglomerate that may represent the fill of ancient submarine canyons developed at the heads of these fans.

40|$|Thesis, (M. S.) Geological Sciences. No {{coverage}} data available. See coverage. spatial for locations. Paleogene {{marine and}} fluvio-deltaic strata are exposed on San Miguel and Santa Cruz Islands, in the Santa Ana Mountains, in San Diego, and near Valle de Las Palmas, Mexico. Many of these strata are conglomeratic and contain pebbles, cobbles, and boulders of rhyolitic to dacitic composition. These distinctive, exotic clasts exhibit genetically-controlled textural, color, and mineralogic characteristics which {{are unique to}} specific lithologic varieties. Using these genetically-controlled features, four families of siliceous meta-volcanic clasts are recognized: Poway, Black Dacites, Owl Creek, and Las Palmas. Poway and Black Dacite clasts are most abundant in conglomerate assemblages from San Miguel Island, Santa Cruz Island, and San Diego. This similarity of conglomerate clast assemblage supports previous suggestions that San Diego and the Northern Channel Islands were once part of a continguous conglomerate terrain and depositional system. Poway and Black Dacite clasts occur together in abundance; however, all the remaining clast families are almost mutually exclusive. Thus, conglomerate assemblage and depositional system are closely related in all the areas studied. Owl Creek clasts are found primarily in Paleogene strata exposed in the Santa Ana Mountains and are well exposed in the Owl Creek Quarry. The remaining clast assemblage, Las Palmas clasts, are found in greatest numbers in the Eocene Las Palmas Gravels of northern Baja California, Mexico. Petrologic features, primarily conglomerate clast assemblages, are combined with lithostratigraphic correlations in reconstruction of a late Paleocene through Eocene depositional system. Tectonically dismembered remnants of this system are found on San Miguel and Santa Cruz Islands and in coastal San Diego. On San Miguel Island, latest Paleocene basin- starved mudstones rest disconformably on latest Maestrichtian middle <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> sandstones. Overlying the Paleocene sequence in apparent conformity are Lower Eocene basin-starved mudstones, fan-fringe siltstones and mudstones, and middle <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> depositional and channel conglomerate. These facies are in turn overlain by latest Lower Eocene through lower Middle Eocene shale-filled channels, levees, fan-fringe and starved basin-mudstones. The remainder of the Middle through Upper Eocene strata are braided, middle <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> sandstones and mudstones. Paleogene sedimentation on Santa Cruz Island {{began in the late}} Paleocene and continued uninterrupted through the entire Eocene. Upper Paleocene strata were deposited on an inner shelf which received detritus washed from paralic environments to the east-northeast. Overlying this facies is a progradational sequence of shelf storm flood-ebb deposits. This sequence of siltstone and fine sandstone is capped by latest Paleocene-Earliest Eocene Poway clast- bearing conglomerate. The remainder of the depositional facies records sedimentation under progressively deepening marine environments These environments include outer shelf, passive slope, <b>fan</b> fringe, outer <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> depositional lobes, and inner <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> channel, Poway clast-bearing conglomerate. In San Diego, the Mount Soledad Conglomerate represents six sedimentary environments: (1) lagoonal, (2) deltaic, (3) alluvial fan and fluvial channels, (4) submarine canyon head, (5) inner fan channel, and (6) slope. Deltaic facies of the Mount Soledad Formation are proximal equivalents to delta-fringe sedimentary rocks on Santa Cruz Island. Alluvial <b>fan,</b> fluvial channel, <b>submarine</b> canyon head, and inner <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> conglomerates are part of the Mount Soledad sequence and represent shelf-edge equivalents to Lower Eocene middle <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> conglomerates on San Miguel Island. Comparison of age and bathymetry of the Mt. Soledad Formation and equivalent facies on San Miguel and Santa Cruz Islands, with Tertiary marine cycles suggests that the sequences of marine environmental facies at all these localities developed synchronously in response to global changes in sea level. Late Paleocene and Early Eocene paleogeography is inferred from lithologic and paleontologic analyses of strata and palinspastic adjustments for: 160 to 200 kilometers of right slip on the East Santa Cruz Basin Fault, 90 kilometers of left-slip on the Malibu Coast Fault System, and 4 kilometers of right-slip on the Mount Soledad Fault...|$|R

They also contain layers of hemipelagic limestones, conglomerates, carbonaceous breccias {{as well as}} olistoliths. Sedimentation of the Kulm facies started in the East already at the Viséan/Serpukhovian boundary (Namurian), but west of the Gallégo river, it started only {{at the beginning of}} the Pennsylvanian (Upper Westphalian, Bashkirian).

5000|$|The {{region of}} present-day Santa Barbara and Ventura County during the Late Cretaceous was submerged, and the depositional {{environment}} {{was one of}} a narrow shelf and <b>submarine</b> <b>fans.</b> The previously exposed Espada Formation, after a period of erosion, was now underwater, and began to receive layers of sediment which would become the Jalama Formation. Periodic episodes of deeper and shallower water resulted in finer and coarser sediments, respectively - shales versus sandstones. [...] The crustal block on which the Jalama formation was deposited has been inferred to have rotated approximately 90 degrees clockwise and moved northward along the coast from its former position nearer San Diego. This motion took place beginning in the early Miocene, during a period of deformation along the boundaries of the Pacific and North American Plates, a boundary represented today by the San Andreas Fault.|$|E
50|$|The ancient marine basin {{that the}} Great Valley Sequence was {{deposited}} in very closely approximates the combined {{extent of the}} modern Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley as delineated by the California Coast Ranges {{on the west side}} and the Sierra Nevada on the east. Geologists believe that the west boundary of this ancient seaway was made up of uplifted rocks of the Franciscan Assemblage that today make up the Coast Ranges. By contrast, the east boundary was a chain of ancient volcanoes located where the Sierra Nevada is today. As these ancient Sierran volcanoes were rapidly eroded they fed volcanic-derived sediment through submarine canyons westward to the ancient <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> of the Great Valley Sequence. Additional sediment was fed into the basin as the granitic roots of these volcanoes were uplifted and eroded.

40|$|Abstract A {{holistic}} {{view of the}} Bengal-Nicobar Fan system requires sampling {{the full}} sedimentary section of the Nicobar Fan, which was achieved {{for the first time}} by International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 362 west of North Sumatra.

This marked rise in {SAR} and a constant Himalayan-derived provenance necessitates a major restructuring of sediment routing in the Bengal-Nicobar <b>submarine</b> <b>fan.</b> This coincides with the inversion of the Eastern Himalayan Shillong Plateau and encroachment of the west-propagating Indo-Burmese wedge, which reduced continental accommodation space and increased sediment supply directly to the fan. Our results challenge a commonly held view that changes in sediment flux seen in the Bengal-Nicobar <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> were caused by discrete tectonic or climatic events acting on the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau.
