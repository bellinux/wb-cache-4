6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} Cynthia's done, Mother?" [...] she cried. [...] "I went into her room a while ago, {{and it was all}} <b>swept</b> and <b>aired,</b> and she was making up the bed." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{let down}} the window--a task {{in which he}} hastened to assist her. A rush of salt, cold <b>air</b> <b>swept</b> into the compartment. He sniffed it eagerly.|$|R
60|$|It was no easy job. The window had {{probably}} not been opened for some time, and stuck obstinately. Finally {{it went up}} with a bang, and a draught of fresh <b>air</b> <b>swept</b> into the place.|$|R
50|$|During {{the fire}} that <b>swept</b> through Bel <b>Air,</b> California in 1961, Grant photographed then-former Vice President Richard Nixon {{standing}} {{on top of the}} roof of his rented house with a water hose, wearing a tie and slacks.|$|R
5000|$|... "Cold Sunday" [...] was a {{meteorological}} event {{which took}} place on January 17, 1982, when unprecedentedly cold <b>air</b> <b>swept</b> down from Canada and plunged temperatures {{across much of the}} United States far below existing all-time record lows.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they are}} rascals {{who ought to}} be in jail," [...] {{answered}} Tom. And then, before the man could ask any more questions, the boys started up the engine and propellers and <b>swept</b> into the <b>air</b> once more.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately a loose brick lay handy {{and with}} this Dick smashed out the panes of glass in the cellar window. Another window was opposite, and this he {{likewise}} demolished. At once a current of pure <b>air</b> <b>swept</b> through the place.|$|R
6000|$|Even {{during the}} last drop from the rocky foliage the Gospodar kept [...] his head. As he fell he pulled his handjar free, and almost as he [...] was falling its sweep took off {{the head of one}} of the assassins. As [...] he touched ground he {{stumbled}} for an instant, but it was towards his [...] enemies. Twice with lightning rapidity the handjar <b>swept</b> the <b>air,</b> [...] and at each sweep a head rolled on the sward.|$|R
60|$|Lilla {{rushed to}} her, {{and the two}} clasped hands. With that, {{a new sense of}} power, greater than Lilla had ever seen in her, seemed to quicken her cousin. Her hand <b>swept</b> the <b>air</b> in front of Edgar Caswall, seeming to drive him {{backward}} more and more by each movement, till at last he seemed to be actually hurled through the door which Mimi's entrance had left open, and fell at full length on the gravel path without.|$|R
50|$|During a {{fight in}} San Miguel de Allende on April 15, 2006 Mirabal was <b>swept</b> into the <b>air</b> and trampled by a vaquilla (horned cow). Older bullfighters distracted the animal to give Mirabal to the time to recover and {{get back in the}} fight.|$|R
60|$|The horn {{dropped to}} the middle of the table, but was {{immediately}} <b>swept</b> into the <b>air</b> again as if by a new and more vigorous hand, and a voice heavily mixed with air, but a man's voice unmistakably, spoke directly to Morton, sternly, contemptuously.|$|R
25|$|Maui's rugged, {{irregular}} topography produces marked {{variations in}} conditions. <b>Air</b> <b>swept</b> inland on the Trade winds is shunted {{one way or}} another by the mountains, valleys, and vast open slopes. This complex three-dimensional flow of air results in striking variations in wind speed, cloud formation, and rainfall.|$|R
60|$|She laughed deliciously, and a snow-squall drove upon us and cut our cheeks, and the Elsinore flung {{over and}} down as if she would never rise again, while we held on and <b>swept</b> through the <b>air</b> in a dizzying arc. Margaret {{released}} a hand, still laughing, and pressed aside my ear-flap.|$|R
60|$|The yards creaked round; the sea grew crisp around them; the hot <b>air</b> <b>swept</b> their cheeks, {{tightened}} every rope, filled every sail, bent her over. A cheer {{burst from}} the men as the helm went up, and they staggered away before the wind, right down upon the Spaniard, who lay still becalmed.|$|R
6000|$|But now, {{a current}} of <b>air</b> <b>swept</b> aside the eddying incense; and the willful boy, all eagerness to behold the image, went hither and thither; but the {{gathering}} of attendants was great; and at last he exclaimed, [...] "Oh Oro! I can not see thee, for the crowd that stands between thee and me." ...|$|R
50|$|Not only is {{the genus}} widespread, there are also several species that have nearly global distribution, and, indeed, it has been {{suggested}} this may be true of all species, a fact that could be borne out by better investigation. Though colpoda are not normally found in the marine environment, there are many ways they can travel from one continent to another. For example, cysts can become lodged in the plumage of migratory birds, becoming dislodged hundreds or even thousands of miles away. Also, because cysts are so small and light, they can be <b>swept</b> by <b>air</b> currents into the upper atmosphere, and then come down on another continent.|$|R
60|$|Not {{far away}} is another equestrian statue, which {{never failed to}} give me a start, when I {{suddenly}} came upon it in a cab. It looked for an instant quite like many statues of George Washington, as it <b>swept</b> the <b>air</b> with its doffed hat, but a second glance always showed it the effigy of George the Third, bowing to posterity with a gracious eighteenth-century majesty. If it were possible, one {{would like to think that}} the resemblance mentioned had grown upon it, and that it in the case of Americans was the poor king's ultimate concession to the good-feeling which seems to be reuniting the people he divided.|$|R
50|$|Falkenhayn {{limited the}} size of the front to 3 - 4 mi to {{concentrate}} artillery firepower and to prevent a breakthrough from a counter-offensive. He also kept tight control of the main reserve, feeding in just enough troops to keep the battle going. In preparation for their attack, the Germans had amassed a concentration of aircraft near the fortress. In the opening phase, they <b>swept</b> the <b>air</b> space of French aircraft, which allowed German artillery-observation aircraft and bombers to operate without interference. In May, the French countered by deploying escadrilles de chasse with superior Nieuport fighters and the air over Verdun turned into a battlefield as both sides fought for air superiority.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{utilization}} of wind energy for power generation purposes {{is becoming increasingly}} attractive and gaining a great share in the electrical power production market worldwide. In the present study, a mathematical model is developed to study the parameters that affect the electrical power generated by the wind turbines. The considered parameters are turbine <b>swept</b> area, <b>air</b> density, wind speed, lift/drag ratio and power coefficient {{as a function of}} blade tip speed. The study shows that the operational aerodynamic parameters has a direct effect on the generated power which will lead the developers and researchers to focus on the highest aerodynamics priority that should be considered for manufacturing and suitable the new generations of wind turbines...|$|R
50|$|Noah calls Mohinder, {{hoping to}} use Molly {{to track down}} West. Unable to simply wait for results, he leaves the house, only to be {{immediately}} <b>swept</b> into the <b>air</b> by West. West demands to know if Claire had betrayed him, but Noah assures him that she never even revealed his existence. His strength failing, West crash-lands. Bennet subdues him and insists he help convince Claire to leave town.|$|R
60|$|Naab had not ceased {{speaking}} when Hare {{saw that}} the train of Indians trailing down the slope was enveloped in red clouds. Then the white wagons disappeared. Soon he was struck in the back by a gust which justified Naab's warning. It <b>swept</b> by; the <b>air</b> grew clear again; once more he could see. But presently a puff, taking him unawares, filled his eyes with dust difficult of removal. Whereupon {{he turned his back}} to the wind.|$|R
50|$|From 1950, North Koreans {{flew the}} Soviet-made MiG-15 jet fighters which {{introduced}} the near-sonic speeds of <b>swept</b> wings to <b>air</b> combat. Though an open secret during the war, {{the most formidable}} pilots today now admit that they were experienced Soviet Air Force pilots, a casus belli deliberately overlooked by the UN allied forces who suspected the use of Russians but were reluctant to engage in open war with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.|$|R
60|$|He {{opened the}} door. A gust of cold, damp <b>air</b> <b>swept</b> into the hall. And yet the doctor {{stood for a}} minute or more {{watching}} the lonely figure which passed slowly through the yellow splotches of the gas lamps, and into the broad bars of darkness between. It was but his own shadow which trailed up the wall as he passed the lights, and yet it looked to the doctor's eye as though some huge and sombre figure walked by a manikin's side and led him silently up the lonely street.|$|R
60|$|The soldier came spurring on, {{making his}} horse rear {{as the people}} pressed about him, cutting {{at the hands of}} those who would have grasped his rein and forced his charger back, and waving to his comrades to follow--and still Barnaby, without {{retreating}} an inch, waited for his coming. Some called to him to fly, and some were in the very act of closing round him, to prevent his being taken, when the pole <b>swept</b> into the <b>air</b> above the people's heads, and the man's saddle was empty in an instant.|$|R
40|$|Wetland insect {{communities}} {{are an important}} food source for waterbirds. Yet studies on insect communities in West African coastal wetlands—a major foraging area for wintering waterbirds of the East Atlantic and Mediterranean flyways—are generally limited. This study investigated the forage potential, micro-spatial and temporal distribution of insects <b>swept</b> from <b>air</b> and low vege-tation in Sakumo II—a coastal Ramsar site in Ghana. Insects of the families Thripidae, Coccinelli-dae, Tetrigidae and Acrididae dominated the wetland. Based on prey yield and abundance, Acri-didae, Coccinellidae and Tetrigidae appeared to be most promising source of food for waterbirds. Despite the high abundance of Thripidae, their low per capita biomass rendered them a less promising food source particularly to large sized waterbird species. Spatial and temporal abun-dance and distributions of insects along both the latitudinal and longitudinal axes of the lagoon were non-significant. In recognition of the diversity and abundance of insects on the wetland, there {{is the need to}} investigate the disparity in the utilisation of the various taxa by waterbird species...|$|R
50|$|While the MiG-15bis {{introduced}} <b>swept</b> {{wings to}} <b>air</b> combat over Korea, the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau {{had already begun}} work on its replacement in 1949 (originally the MiG-15bis45) in order to fix any problems found with the MiG-15 in combat. The result {{was one of the}} most successful transonic fighters introduced before the advent of true supersonic types such as the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19 and North American F-100 Super Sabre. The design would ultimately still prove effective into the 1960s when pressed into subsonic dogfights over Vietnam against much faster planes which were not optimized for maneuvering in such slower speed, short-range engagements.|$|R
60|$|But the {{friendly}} advice {{was lost in}} the now increasing wind. With a suddenness by no means unusual in these latitudes, the light breeze soon became a succession of sharp squalls, and our sail-proud braggadacio of an India-man was observed to let everything go by the run, his t'-gallant stun'-sails and flying-jib taking quick leave of the spars; the flying-jib was <b>swept</b> into the <b>air,</b> rolled together for a few minutes, and tossed about in the squalls like a foot-ball. But the wind played no such pranks with the more prudently managed canvas of the Neversink, though before many hours it was stirring times with us.|$|R

50|$|The first lake-effect snow event {{around the}} Great Lakes {{occurred}} as cold <b>air</b> <b>swept</b> through the region. The Upper Peninsula of Michigan saw up to {{a foot of}} snow, while up to 8 in of snow fell in northern Pennsylvania. Significant snow also fell in western New York in the typical snowbelt regions. Areas on the southern shores of Lake Superior and Georgian Bay in Ontario also received significant amount of snows in excess of 6 inches (15 cm). The low pressure disturbance continued eastward to produce significant snowfalls across the mountains of central Quebec in excess of 12 inches (30 cm), disrupting traffic in several areas.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Magog, does boisterous mirth beseem the Giant Warder of {{this ancient}} city? Is this {{becoming}} demeanour for a watchful spirit over whose bodiless head {{so many years}} have rolled, so many changes <b>swept</b> like empty <b>air</b> - in whose impalpable nostrils the scent of blood and crime, pestilence, cruelty, and horror, has been familiar as breath to mortals - in whose sight Time has gathered in the harvest of centuries, and garnered so many crops of human pride, affections, hopes, and sorrows? Bethink you of our compact. The night wanes; feasting, revelry, and music have encroached upon our usual hours of solitude, and morning will be here apace. Ere we are stricken mute again, bethink you of our compact.' ...|$|R
60|$|A {{change had}} now {{come over the}} face of the sky. Clouds began to gather on the horizon, and a few light puffs of <b>air</b> <b>swept</b> over the sea, which enabled the strange vessel to bear down on her boat, and take the whale in tow. It also enabled the Red Eric to beat up, but more slowly, towards the spot where their {{disabled}} boat lay, and rescue their comrades from their awkward position. It was some time before the boats were all gathered together. When this was accomplished the night had set in and the stranger had made off with her ill-gotten prize, the other whale having sounded, and the chase being abandoned.|$|R
60|$|The {{windows were}} open wide, and a sweet, warm <b>air</b> <b>swept</b> into the barely {{furnished}} room. The spaciousness {{of the room}} impressed her, and she {{was pleased with the}} evident unity of these brown-faced, strong-armed toilers with their leader. At {{the head of the table}} he sat, self-contained, but courteous and responsive to all alike, and though they were in an essentially democratic country, she felt that there was something almost feudal in the relations between him and his men. She could not imagine them to be confined to the mere exaction of so much labor and the expectation of payment of wages due. She was pleased that he had not changed his clothing.|$|R
60|$|They {{travelled}} near {{a league}} in this manner, without obtaining the desired {{glimpse of the}} river. The fire was still raging in the distance, and as the <b>air</b> <b>swept</b> away the first vapour of the conflagration, fresh volumes rolled along the place, limiting the view. At length the old man, who had begun to betray some little uneasiness, which caused his followers to apprehend that even his acute faculties were beginning to be confused, in the mazes of the smoke, made a sudden pause, and dropping his rifle to the ground, he stood, apparently musing over some object at his feet. Middleton and the rest rode up to his side, and demanded the reason of the halt.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} volume of The Divine Comedy, Dante and Virgil meet Francesca and her lover Paolo in the second circle of hell, {{reserved}} for the lustful. Here, the couple is trapped in an eternal whirlwind, doomed to be forever <b>swept</b> through the <b>air</b> just as they allowed themselves to be swept away by their passions. Dante calls out to the lovers, who are compelled to briefly pause before him, and he speaks with Francesca. She obliquely states a few of the details of her life and her death, and Dante, apparently familiar with her story, correctly identifies her by name. He asks her what led to her and Paolo's damnation, and Francesca's story strikes such a chord within Dante that he faints out of pity.|$|R
500|$|In Dixie County, {{storm surge}} heights {{generally}} ranged from [...] and peaked just inches below observations during the 1993 Storm of the Century. A total of 61homes or businesses that were demolished, 540sustained major damage, and 322 suffered minor impact. Much {{of the damage}} in Levy County was also due to storm surge, with [...] above average tides observed. In Cedar Key, storm surge washed across the entire island. The only grocery store suffered wind and coastal flood damage, with food scattered on the floor. At a motel, water <b>swept</b> away <b>air</b> conditioners and left seaweed and mud inside. The storm caused an electrical fire that burnt down the clam processing plant. On Dock Street, which contains several restaurants on stilts, the decks and interiors of the restaurants were damaged. The post office and city hall were severely damaged. Storm damage in Cedar Key was estimated at over $10million. Additionally, over 40homes and businesses in west Yankeetown were damaged by coastal flooding. Throughout Levy County, one structure was destroyed, 68suffered major damage, and 51others received minor impact. Coastal areas of Citrus County suffered from significant flooding; 2,694structures sustained damage, of which 531 suffered major damage. Total losses in the county reached $102million.|$|R
