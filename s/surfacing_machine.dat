Any {{kinds of}} tiny {{vibration}} of machine tool parts {{will have a}} great influence on surface quality of the workpiece at ultra-precise machining process of aspheric surface. At present the major way for decreasing influence of vibration is machining compensation technology. Therefore {{it is important for}} machining compensation control to acquire and transmit these vibration signals effectively.

The overall goal of this research is the integration of geometric and mechanistic milling models for force prediction and feedrate scheduling for free-form <b>surface</b> <b>machining.</b> For each tool move a geometric model calculates the cutting geometry parameters, then a mechanistic model uses this information with the constraint force to calculate desired feedrates. The feedrate is written into the part program. When the integrated modeling approach was used, it was shown that the machining time can be decreased significantly along the tool path.
