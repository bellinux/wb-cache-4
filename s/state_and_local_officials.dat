25|$|Though {{during the}} early 20th century {{gambling}} had been mostly illegal throughout the nation, Nevada legalized gambling in 1931. Initially this development sparked minimal national attention but during the 1940s the city of Las Vegas had begun to attract national attention from gaming figures around the country. As tolerance of illegal gambling and other vice in Texas gradually waned and crackdowns on vice by <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> <b>officials</b> increased, many gaming leaders in the state began to move their operations to the Nevada desert becoming instrumental in the city's development.Thompson (2001), p. 21, 106.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The {{free flow of information}} among federal, <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> law enforcement agencies could prove vital to fighting the war on terrorism. <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> law enforcement <b>officials</b> are key stakeholders in the United States' efforts to combat terrorism, and as such, they may require access to classified national security information to help prevent or respond to terrorist attacks. In order to gain access to such information, <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> law enforcement <b>officials</b> generally need federal security clearances. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) grants security clearances and shares classified information with <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> law enforcement <b>officials.</b> Immediately following September 11, 2001, some <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> law enforcement <b>officials</b> expressed frustration with the complexity of the process for obtaining security clearances. Others expressed frustration with the length of time it took to obtain a security clearance. These frustrations exacerbated the general concern among law enforcement stakeholders that the lack of security clearances could impede the flow of critical information from the FBI to the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> level, from the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> level to the FBI, and laterally from one state or local agency to another. In turn, this potential lack of access to critical terrorism-related information might place <b>local</b> law enforcement <b>officials</b> at a disadvantage in their efforts to respond to or combat a terrorist threat. The Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Senate Committee on the Judiciary asked us to examine several issues regarding the FBI's process for granting security clearances to <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> law enforcement <b>officials.</b> This report provides information on: (1) the FBI's process for granting security clearances to <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> law enforcement <b>officials,</b> (2) {{the extent to which the}} FBI has met its time frame goals for processing security clearance applications for <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> law enforcement <b>officials</b> <b>and</b> factors that could affect the timely processing of security clearance applications, and (3) efforts undertaken by the FBI to enhance its security clearance and information-sharing processes with <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> law enforcement <b>officials.</b> ...|$|R
