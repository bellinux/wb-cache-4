5|$|David Ignatius, a {{columnist}} for the Washington Post {{and the author of the}} book Body of Lies, opined that the CIA had become careless out of desperation. According to Ignatius, it would be obvious that the CIA would have been <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> to acquire knowledge about the location of Osama bin Laden that it would take every available opportunity to get information. Shoshana Bryen, a U.S. security expert, said that the bombing would make Israel and the U.S. wary in their future dealings with Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Fans of {{the series}} were <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> for the latest {{instalment}} that bookstores around the world began holding events {{to coincide with the}} midnight release of the books, beginning with the 2000 publication of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The events, commonly featuring mock sorting, games, face painting, and other live entertainment have achieved popularity with Potter fans and have been highly successful in attracting fans and selling books with nearly nine million of the 10.8 million initial print copies of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince sold in the first 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{beginning}} principal photography, Refn {{went to the}} 2010 Cannes Film Festival to sell the rights to Drive and released promotional posters for the film. In November 2010, FilmDistrict acquired North American distribution rights. The owners were <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> {{to get their hands}} on Drive, they started negotiating to buy it before seeing any footage, believing it could appeal to people who enjoy a genre movie, as well as the arthouse crowd. The film had a release date of September 16, 2011, in the United States.|$|E

60|$|As {{he looked}} back at the monstrous hive of men the wonder of Helen's {{personality}} came to him.

5|$|At 09:00 Linois {{was still}} only observing the convoy, {{reluctant}} to attack {{until he could}} be sure {{of the nature of}} his opponents. Dance responded to the reprieve by reforming the line of battle into sailing formation to increase his convoy's speed with the intention of reaching the Straits ahead of Linois. With the convoy a less intimidating target, Linois began to slowly approach the British ships. By 13:00 it was clear that Linois's faster ships were in danger of isolating the rear of the convoy, and Dance ordered his lead ships to tack and come about, so that they would cross in front of the French squadron. The British successfully executed the manoeuvre, and at 13:15 Linois opened fire on the lead ship—Royal George—under the command of John Fam Timmins. The Royal George and the next four ships in line, the Indiaman Ganges, Dance's Earl Camden, the Warley and the Alfred, all returned fire, Ganges initially attacking Royal George in error. Captain James Prendergrass in Hope, the next in line, was <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> to join the battle that he misjudged his speed and collided with Warley, the ships falling back as their crews worked to separate their rigging. Shots were then exchanged at long range for 43 minutes, neither side inflicting severe damage.|$|E
25|$|Producer Sam Spiegel {{initially}} {{planned to}} hire director John Huston, who had rewritten the screenplay by Anthony Veiller. When Huston entered the military, Welles {{was given the}} chance to direct and prove himself able to make a film on schedule and under budget—something he was <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> to do that he accepted a disadvantageous contract. One of its concessions was that he would defer to the studio in any creative dispute.|$|E
25|$|The two {{remaining}} original {{buildings on the}} Phoenix Block, {{one of which is}} the Kersey H. Fell building, are done in the Greek Revival style of architecture. They share a common wall and use simple stone lentils and sills in the windows. The storefronts are accented by columns. The common wall helped to increase the speed which the Phoenix Block was constructed at. <b>So</b> <b>eager</b> were merchants to occupy the storefronts that several stores opened for business while workers were still constructing the second and third floors of the buildings.|$|E
6000|$|The child sat by, {{and watched}} its {{progress}} with a troubled mind. Regardless {{of the run}} of luck, and mindful only of the desperate passion which had its hold upon her grandfather, losses and gains were to her alike. Exulting in some brief triumph, or cast down by a defeat, there he sat so wild and restless, so feverishly and intensely anxious, <b>so</b> terribly <b>eager,</b> <b>so</b> ravenous for the paltry stakes, {{that she could have}} almost better borne to see him dead. And yet she was the innocent cause of all this torture, and he, gambling with such a savage thirst for gain as the most insatiable gambler never felt, had not one selfish thought! ...|$|R

Rude it seemed; in Monty's ease more than that. Madeline hardly knew {{what to make of}} it.|$|R
25|$|Maine was <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> for {{the cause}} that it ended up {{contributing}} {{a larger number of}} combatants, in proportion to its population, than any other Union state. It was second only to Massachusetts in the number of its sailors who served in the Union Navy. Colonel Joshua L. Chamberlain (later a major general) and the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment played a key role at the Battle of Gettysburg, and the 1st Maine Heavy Artillery Regiment lost more men in a single charge (during the Siege of Petersburg) than any Union regiment in the war.|$|E

Charlie talks and interacts with all the ghosts, relives {{important}} moments from his youth, and comes to grips with his complicated feelings for his adoptive parents. Through Charlie's conversations and interactions with the ghosts in his home, we see both why he loved his parents and why he was <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> to leave them far behind.|$|E

Furthermore, if she did not marry Atli, she would live without husband {{for the rest of her}} life. Guðrún responded that her mother should not be <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> to giver her away to the Huns, and she prophesied that Atli would kill Gunnarr and tear out the heart of Högni. Grímhildr began to weep when she heard the prophecy and told Guðrún that she was forced to give her away to Atli.|$|E

25|$|Puddefoot's {{exploits}} {{made him}} much sought after and Falkirk, who had witnessed the player first-hand, {{won the battle}} for his transfer on 7 February 1922. The fee of £5,000 was a world football transfer record, and represented the only time a Scottish team has broken the record. <b>So</b> <b>eager</b> were the Falkirk supporters to land their man that they themselves raised money for the purchase by setting up a public conscription. Puddefoot himself earned a £390 fee for agreeing the transfer.

500|$|The Final Cut is an anti-war concept album, whose lyrics {{explore what}} Waters regards as the {{betrayal}} of fallen British servicemen—such as his father—who during the Second World War sacrificed {{their lives in}} the spirit of a post-war dream. [...] This post-war dream was that their victory would usher in a more peaceful world, whose leaders would no longer be <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> to resolve disputes by resorting to war. [...] The album's lyrics are critical of Thatcher, whose policies and decisions Waters regarded as an example of this betrayal. [...] She is referred to as [...] "Maggie" [...] throughout the album.|$|E

Even the lack of an Argentine merchant fleet allowed Britain to manage the maritime trade. Forbes's testimony should be appraised in perspective of the contemporary Anglo-American commercial rivalry, In light of the partial nature of the account and of his [...] "jealousy, even antipathy" [...] towards the English in Rio de la Plata.|$|E

However, the parties who provided the scalpers with the tickets were never identified, and the show ran without interference. The production had a $50,600 weekly gross, and ran for 1,925 performances. The national tour began in 1950 and grossed $3,000,000 in the first year, making $1,500,000 in profit.

[...] Mihdhar, who had spent time in al-Qaeda camps in the 1990s, was known and highly regarded by Bin Laden.

On the contrary, all I knew was the dull {{numbness}} of a brain that was not worked at all. That was the trouble.

500|$|Alt Sounds writer Candice Haridimou {{gave the}} album {{a rating of}} 94% out of 100% and praised the album's lyrical content. She said the {{political}} nature of the album also uses emotional dramatisation to capture the listener, particularly in songs like [...] "Devil's Island". Haridimou states the song [...] "drives remorse into the cold hearts of those involved. It’s a severe and poignant song that will {{stand the test of}} time." [...] Ryan Bird, in an otherwise positive review of Daybreaker, criticised it upon first hearing it; he said it struggled to settle into any distinctive rhythm or groove. However, Bird concluded his review by saying, [...] "but despite its relative (and relatively few) faults.

Lopez first heard Disney Animation's pitch while in Los Angeles working on The Book of Mormon, but Disney was <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> to get both of them on board that the production team traveled to New York City to also pitch the film in person to Anderson-Lopez (who was busy raising the couple's two young daughters). Lopez believes Disney was particularly interested in his wife's strong story talent. The decision, of course, was easy: [...] "Whenever Disney asks {{if you want to}} do a fairy tale musical, you say yes." ...|$|E

[...] McCartney asked Lennon why he was <b>so</b> <b>eager</b> {{to be the one}} to go with the Maharishi on his helicopter ride, to which Lennon replied, [...] "I thought he'd slip me the answer."
