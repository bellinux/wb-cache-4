40|$|To better {{understand}} the possible relationships between the geology of the seabed and the associated biological communities, we conducted a multibeam sonar survey over New Zealand Star Bank in the eastern Bass Strait. We applied a hierarchical method of benthic habitat mapping to the <b>Secondary</b> <b>Biotope</b> and Biological Facies levels at the site (< 10 km) scale. Four Secondary Biotopes and four Biological Facies have been defined {{on the basis of}} geomorphology revealed by the bathymetry model and the results of statistical analysis of the sediment and underwater video transect data over the bank. The major differences which control the distribution of biological communities in the New Zealand Star Bank area appear to be related to variations in substrate: (1) Hard-ground features related to high-relief granite outcrops are associated with diverse and abundant sessile and motile fauna. These faunal communities may be biologically-modified to patchy barrens habitat by grazing urchins. (2) Unconsolidated sediment on a flat seabed is associated with sparse small sponges on the inner shelf. On the middle shelf and seaward of bank, the flat and muddy seabed supports a community dominated by infauna. (3) Unconsolidated sediment on a low-relief seabed is associated with an increase in the density and sizes of sponges concentrated on any low-relief feature raised above the surrounding flat seabed...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} as to whether geophysical data from habitats can be used to predict the occurrence of benthic biodiversity is becoming more important with the increase in Marine Protected Areas as tools for marine conservation. To help answer this question and to better understand the relationship between sediment, geomorphology and benthos, we conducted a multibeam sonar survey over two areas in the northern Great Barrier Reef - Gulf of Papua region. Multivariate statistical analyses (cluster, multi-dimensional scaling and BIO-ENV procedure) of the physical and biological datasets from both areas, determined that the geophysical variables, slope and gravel percentage, were the best predictors for megabenthos assemblage patterns. In conjunction with Geographic Information System (GIS) models of the geomorphology and bathymetry, these geophysical variables were used to derive the spatial boundaries of benthic habitats for each study area. We applied a hierarchical method of benthic habitat mapping to the <b>Secondary</b> <b>Biotope</b> and Biological Facies levels at the site (< 10 km) scale. The combination of substrate type, sedimentary dynamics and physical processes related to near-seabed currents appear to be a dominant control on the benthic communities in the northern Great Barrier Reef - Gulf of Papua region. These results add confidence to the use of geophysical data from seabed habitats, such as geology, sediment and morphology, as predictors for benthos distribution and thus provide a basis for marine reserve selection...|$|E
40|$|Continental shelf {{waters are}} subject to the {{greatest}} impact by humans. If marine ecosystems are to be efficiently managed and protected from the adverse effects of human activities, then identification of the types of marine habitats and the communities they contain is required. Research cruise data and existing data were collected at three diverse study sites on polar, temperate and tropical continental shelves within Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). This project conducted a multi-disciplinary analysis of satellite imagery, multibeam sonar, seismic profiles, oceanographic data, underwater video, and the results of sediment sampling. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was utilised to model the spatial boundaries of the physical and biological datasets. Spatial and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted on the GIS models and datasets to explore the relationships between abiotic and biotic patterns. GIS was used to map the spatial distribution of benthic habitats at each study site within a hierarchical context. The East Antarctic continental shelf has had few studies examining the macrobenthos structure or relating biological communities to the abiotic environment. On the George V Shelf, GIS was used to map the geomorphology, surficial sediment and near-seabed water mass boundaries. A study of underwater photographs and the results of biological sampling provided information to infer the dominant trophic structure of benthic communities within geomorphic features. A hierarchical method of benthic habitat mapping was applied to the Geomorphic Unit and Biotope levels at the local (10 s of km) scale. The study revealed that mud content, iceberg scour, and oceanic currents are the likely dominant abiotic factors in the broad-scale distribution of macrofauna on the George V Shelf. To better understand the relationships between the geology of the seabed and associated biological communities, a multibeam sonar survey was conducted over New Zealand Star Bank, eastern Bass Strait, Australia. Through spatial and multivariate analyses of surficial sediment composition and underwater video, the biological assemblage patterns were related to the variation in geomorphology and substrate. A hierarchical method of benthic habitat mapping was applied to the <b>Secondary</b> <b>Biotope</b> and Biological Facies levels at the site (< 10 km) scale. The major differences which control the distribution of biological communities in the New Zealand Star Bank area appear to be related to variations in substrate. To help answer the question whether geophysical data from habitats can be used to predict the occurrence of benthic biodiversity, a multibeam sonar survey was conducted in the northern Great Barrier Reef - Gulf of Papua region. Multivariate statistical analyses were applied to the biological and physical datasets to determine patterns in the distribution of megabenthos, and the relationship with abiotic variables. A hierarchical method of benthic habitat mapping was applied to the <b>Secondary</b> <b>Biotope</b> and Biological Facies levels at the site (< 10 km) scale. The combination of substrate type, sedimentary dynamics and physical processes related to nearseabed currents appear to be a dominant control on the benthic communities in the northern Great Barrier Reef - Gulf of Papua region. Benthic habitat mapping plays a vital part in understanding marine ecosystems and the processes which influence the spatial distribution of benthos. The results of this research have made significant in-roads {{in the development of a}} framework for ecosystem-based management of the study areas, the contribution to the ongoing bioregionalisation of Australia, and through an examination of the use of geophysical proxies for the occurrence of biological assemblages, which are fundamental to the establishment of Marine Protected Areas...|$|E
40|$|Bodies of {{waters in}} caves and in crevices of rocks are {{distinguished}} from the other subsoil water ecosystems (“eustygon”, “stygorhithron”, “stygopotamon”) under the names “troglostygon” and “petrostygon”. The colonisation of subsoil water biotopes involves a fundamental principle which controls {{the development of the}} main biotopes for the stygobiont undergroundwater organisms. According to this ecological rule, which is described in detail and formulated, the several interstitial biotopes (for example “eustygopsammal,” “rhithrostygopsammal,” “potamostygopsephal”) are to be considered as the real biotopes of the stygobiont subsoil water organisms; waters in caves, on the contrary, are <b>secondary</b> <b>biotopes</b> of these animals. Caves which contain marine water are described as ecostystem “Thalassotroglon” in their relation to “limnotroglon” (= “stygotroglon”). In this why the contact between “limnospeology” and “thalassospeology” is established, and the limnic and marine microcavernal biotopes - ”thalassopsammal” and “thalassopsephal” - are also taken in consideration. “Limnospeology” and “thalassospeology” as limnological and thalassological investigations of subsoil water are characterized as biological fields of work, which serve for the investigation of an ecological unit...|$|R
40|$|The species {{diversity}} of ground beetles (Carabidae) was monitored in the plantations of fast growing trees (poplars and willows) in the District of Žďár nad Sázavou, Czech Republic (faunistic square 6463). Relations {{between age and}} type of vegetation and biodiversity were observed. Samples were collected from pitfall traps at monthly intervals from May to October in 2008. In total, 36 species of Carabidae represented by 912 specimens were entrapped in the 4 monitored plots. Basic synecologic characteristics (dominance, {{species diversity}}, evenness and Jaccard similarity index) were evaluated. The most numerous species in the plot No. 1 was Abax parallelepipedus (99 specimens), in the plot No. 2 Limodromus assimilis (112 specimens), in the plot No. 3 Amara montivaga (32 specimens) and in the plot No. 4 Poecilus cupreus (52 specimens). The majority of adaptable species was recorded in the plot No. 1, which signifies a well-regenerated <b>secondary</b> <b>biotope.</b> Shannon’s diversity index (2. 78) were {{the highest in the}} plot No. 3, and the highest evenness was also in the plot No. ​ 3 (0. 84). The highest similarity expressed by the Jaccard similarity index was observed between the plots No. 2 and 4, the lowest between the plots No. 1 and 3. Fast growing trees plantations host similar fauna of ground beetles as the surrounding agroecosystems with eurytopic species dominating. Specific species of cultivated trees do not probably significantly affect the species composition of ground beetles, but the density of vegetation can affect the abundance of species present. Two threatened species of (Brachinus explodens and Cicindela campestris) according to Decree No. 395 / 1992 Coll. were identified in the monitored plots...|$|E
