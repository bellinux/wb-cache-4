60|$|In {{order to}} march thither, I {{assembled}} the companies at Bethlehem, the chief establishment of those people. I {{was surprised to}} find it in so good a posture of defense; the destruction of Gnadenhut had made them apprehend danger. The principal buildings were defended by a stockade; they had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from New York, and had even plac'd quantities of <b>small</b> <b>paving</b> stones between the windows of their high stone houses, for their women to throw down upon the heads of any Indians that should attempt to force into them. The armed brethren, too, kept watch, and reliev'd as methodically as in any garrison town. In conversation with the bishop, Spangenberg, I mention'd this my surprise; for, knowing they had obtained an act of Parliament exempting them from military duties in the colonies, I had suppos'd they were conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms. He answer'd me that it was not one of their established principles, but that, {{at the time of their}} obtaining that act, it was thought to be a principle with many of their people. On this occasion, however, they, to their surprise, found it adopted by but a few. It seems they were either deceiv'd in themselves, or deceiv'd the Parliament; but common sense, aided by present danger, will sometimes be too strong for whimsical opinions.|$|E

50|$|Max awakes with a {{start from}} a bad dream the next morning. Outside, dawn is breaking, and the air is clouded with a hazy mist. No one else is awake, and he decides {{to go outside and}} explore the mysterious garden he had {{observed}} through the window the night before.He must break a lock to access the garden, and he is overcome with a foreboding feeling as he enters. Inside, he discovers the statues depict ominous-looking circus characters, including a lion tamer, a contortionist, a fakir, a strong man, and some other ghostly characters, all are arranged in a star pattern around one central figure on a pedestal: a terrible clown, with arms outstretched and hands in a fist. At the clown’s feat, Max sees another <b>small</b> <b>paving</b> stone with the same six-pointed star inside of a circle inscribed on its surface. Max looks up again, and sees the hand of the clown is now open to the sky. Afraid, he flees back to the house, not looking back.Finding his family now awake and preparing breakfast, Max decides not to tell them what he has seen because he knows they will be skeptical, and he doesn’t want to crush his father’s excitement about their new home.Maximilian Carver eagerly tells the family about his own discovery in the shed outside: an old projector and a box of old films, as well as two bicycles.|$|E
40|$|By 2015, all {{herbicide}} use {{on public}} pavements in Flanders (northern region of Belgium) will be phased out. Currently, {{little is known}} about weed flora in these pavements or their interactions with different weed control methods. The objectives of this study were to explore the species composition of pavements in relation to various abiotic factors and applied weed control methods. A vegetation survey was conducted on 163 public pavements constructed with <b>small</b> <b>paving</b> elements across Flanders. Botanical composition was determined, and a score for street scene perception was calculated. For each pavement, a set of environmental conditions and technical characteristics was determined, and data on the applied weed control methods were collected. Apart from Musci (mosses), the most important plant species were Poa annua, Sagina procumbens, Conyza canadensis, Taraxacum officinale and Plantago major. Weed species composition and street scene perception were affected by intensity of use, joint width and light intensity. Weed prevention measures may be built into the construction of pavements by manipulating light, joints and use in their design. Repeated use of a single weed control method caused shifts in weed flora. This suggests that more optimal weed control on pavements is likely to be achieved by alternating weed control methods...|$|E
40|$|In {{interlocking}} {{concrete block}} pavement, the blocks {{make up the}} wearing surface and are a major load-spreading component of the pavement. It differs from other conventional form of pavement that the wearing surface is made from <b>small</b> <b>paving</b> units embedded and joined in sand rather than continuous paving. Beneath the bedding sand the substructure {{is similar to that}} of a flexible pavement. The interlocking concrete block pavement (ICBP) has gained rapid popularity in many foreign countries as an alternative to concrete and asphalt pavements. However the manifest advantages of ICBP has not fully extended in India because of lack of proven indigenous design and construction information. There are not any IRC codes or IS codes available for specification and design of it. This paper presents the results of a series of tests conducted to assess the influence of block shape, thickness, size, compressive strength, and laying pattern on the overall pavement performance. The test setup discussed here was used to study these factors based on static plate loading. The effect of load repletion on the pavement behavior is discussed. The mechanism of load transfer, the effect bedding sand, jointing sand and edge restraints are discussed. The behavior of test pavement is characterized in terms of deflection. The applied load was increased in 10 KN increments from zero to one half the single axle legal limits. It is found that shape, size, thickness of block have a significant influence on the behavior of concrete block pavement...|$|E
