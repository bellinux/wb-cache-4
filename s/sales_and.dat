40|$|Corporate {{real estate}} {{disposals}} {{have increased in}} Europe {{during the past few}} years. In this research paper, we study market reactions of publicly traded European companies' real estate <b>sale</b> <b>and</b> leaseback announcements during 1998 - 2004. This study {{is one of the first}} ones to study the <b>sale</b> <b>and</b> leaseback impact on corporate value with a pan-European data. We find that the <b>sale</b> <b>and</b> leaseback announcements have on average positive impact to firm's value which is in line with the previous studies. However, we also find that the positive effect is mainly caused by the deals with high transaction value to company market value ratio. Smaller transactions do not create on average any abnormal returns. Our results support the hypothesis that the positive <b>sale</b> <b>and</b> leaseback announcement effect is a consequence of revealed hidden value of the company's assets. Thus, <b>sale</b> <b>and</b> leaseback can also be seen as a mechanism for revealing the hidden value of company's assets to the market.
