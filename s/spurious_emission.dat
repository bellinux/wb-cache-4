HF RFID tags produce unwanted emission due to rectification and more generally due to nonlinearity of analog front end. Depending on the conducting material of an HF RFID coil and surrounding dielectric material, the coil behaves as more or less good antenna on some harmonic frequencies. Exact characterization and analysis of unwanted emission is important from the security perspective {{as well as from}} the perspective of interference with other systems.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental work}} on the detection of <b>spurious</b> RF <b>emissions</b> of mini Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (mini-UAV). Many recent events have shown that mini-UAVs {{can be considered as}} a potential threat for civil security. For this reason the detection of mini-UAVs has become of interest to the sensor community. The detection, classification and identification chain can take advantage of different sensor technologies. Apart from the signatures used by radar and electro-optical sensor systems, the UAV also emits RF signals. These RF signatures can be split in intentional signals for communication with the operator and un-intentional RF signals emitted by the UAV. These unintentional or <b>spurious</b> RF <b>emissions</b> are very weak but could be used to discriminate potential UAV detections from false alarms. The goal of this research was to assess the potential of exploiting <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> in the classification and identification chain of mini-UAVs. It was already known that spurious signals are very weak, but the focus was on the question whether the emission pattern could be correlated to the behaviour of the UAV. In this paper experimental examples of <b>spurious</b> RF <b>emission</b> for different types of mini-UAVs and their correlation with the electronic circuits in the UAVs will be shown. © 2016 SPIE.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} is {{presented}} a useful and economic measuring principle with which radar <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> can be investigated {{under field conditions}} without disturbing {{the function of the}} radar in any way. The method presented here consists of two parts: In the time-domain parameter study is presented, how the radar antenna rotation produces radar pulses to the measuring receiver. Also is presented, how receiver parameters are defined by availability and use of radar pulses in the measurement. In the frequency spectrum measurement part a new sweep measurement system is presented. In this measurement the YIG filter presented by ITU [1] is replaced by a similar multistage tunable band-stop filter, which meets similar filtering characteristics, this is more easy to use and a less expensive filter. It is explained how the needed measurement dynamics are achieved and how the measurement time is determined and optimized in different situations. A two part measuring approach like this has not been reported before. ITU recommendations for attenuation of radar <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> are updated to 100 dB below the radar nominal frequency (NF) signal level. The fulfillment of these spurious level requirements sets a hard challenge for measuring dynamics: dynamics must be more than 110 dB. The author provides in this work a solution to this requirement. This measuring method produces results, with which one can conclude the relative power level of radar <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> and its effect on other radio services. In this work the spectrum produced by a 5 GHz weather radar has been studied and the results have been applied to study radar impact to terrestrial digital radio relay systems (TDRRS). The achieved result is both very important and current, and it can be utilized in the planning of new radar systems as also in the planning of new radio networks operating in the frequency ranges adjacent to radar frequencies. Possible radio networks in addition to TDRRSs that can be interfered from radar <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> are Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Area (WiMAX) and Ultra Wide Band (UWB) systems. These systems also can interfere with radar frequencies...|$|R

Additionally, the great magnitude of gain generated must be carefully controlled so that <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> are not produced within the receiver. These would lead to distortion of the recovered information, or, at worst, may radiate signals that interfere with other receivers.|$|R
40|$|A {{process is}} {{demonstrated}} to show compatibility between a {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) tag and an aircraft glideslope (GS) radio r eceiver.

40|$|Abstract. Line {{emission}} intensities and FWHMs in {{the range}} 1175 − 1900 A have been measured on high resolu-tion IUE spectra of RR Tel taken from 1978 to 1993. The variations observed in the emission line intensities show a rather strong correlation with the line ionization. The decrease is of a factor larger than three and up to ten for the low-ionization lines, and of a factor between two and three for the medium-high ionization lines. Instead, the high ionization lines have generally maintained their 1978 strength or have even increased it. For all lines no varia-tion in the FWHM has been detected. Special {{attention has been paid}} to a very long exposure spectrum already studied by other authors for which we present new identi-cations and several comments.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the concern for}} Wireless Local Area Network devices and two-way radios to cause electromagnetic interference to aircraft navigation radio systems. Spurious radiated emissions from various IEEE 802. 11 a, 802. 11 b, and Bluetooth devices are characterized using reverberation chambers. The results are compared with baseline emissions from standard laptop computer and personal digital assistants (PDAs) that are currently allowed for use on aircraft. The {{results indicate that the}} WLAN devices tested are not more of a threat to aircraft navigation radios than standard laptop computers and PDAs in most aircraft bands. In addition, spurious radiated emission data from seven pairs of two-way radios are provided. These twoway radios emit at much higher levels in the bands considered.

40|$|This report compiles and {{analyzes}} {{tests that}} {{were conducted to}} measure cell phone <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> in the Global Positioning System (GPS) radio frequency band that could affect the navigation system of an aircraft.

50|$|In telecommunications, a {{spectral}} mask, {{also known}} as a channel mask or transmission mask, is a mathematically-defined set of lines applied to the levels of radio (or optical) transmissions. The spectral mask is generally intended to reduce adjacent-channel interference by limiting excessive radiation at frequencies beyond the necessary bandwidth. Attenuation of these <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> is usually done with a band-pass filter, tuned to allow through the correct center frequency of the carrier wave, as well as all necessary sidebands.|$|R

Overmodulation results in <b>spurious</b> <b>emissions</b> by the modulated carrier, and distortion of the recovered modulating signal.
