6000|$|The second Sunday {{after the}} {{partition}} of goods the entire Coolly turned out to church {{in spite of the}} muddy road. The men, after driving up {{to the door of the}} little white church and helping the women to alight, drove out to the sheds along the fence and gathered in knots beside their wagons in the warm spring sun. It was very pleasant there, and the men leaned with relaxed muscles upon the wagon-wheels, or sat on the fence with jack-knives in hand. The horses, weary with six days seeding, slept with closed eyes and drooping lips. Generally the talk was upon <b>spring</b> <b>work,</b> each man bragging of the number of acres he had sown during the week, but this morning the talk was all about the division which had come between the nieces of [...] "deceased Williams."

She was thinking of him as she worked that day, and wishing she could mould his life as easily as she did the yellow lumps before her, stamping them with her own mark, and setting them away for her own use. She felt that some change was about to befall Nat, for she had listened to the murmur of voices as {{the old man and}} the young sat talking far into the night. What the result had been was as yet unknown; for Uncle Daniel was unusually taciturn that morning, and Nat had been shut up in his room since breakfast, though <b>spring</b> <b>work</b> waited for him all about the farm.|$|E

5000|$|During 1933-4 the {{authorities}} {{began to come}} down in favour of the more stable kinds of zveno. This was to ensure the responsibility and accountability of the zveno's members for their work. At the beginning of 1933 the agricultural writer Samarina considered that, in the drier steppe areas, task-combined zvenya would ensure that all related jobs in <b>spring</b> <b>work</b> (ploughing, harrowing, sowing) would be carried out in quick succession before the soil dried out. (Task-specialized were still regarded as useful in non-black earth areas.) A year later another writer, Kayurova, extended the idea of fixity to the whole season of [...] "early work".|$|E

50|$|Moylan {{exceeded}} rehabilitation {{expectations and}} was declared fit to pitch during the Braves' 2009 Spring Training camp in Orlando, Florida. Moylan worked with former Braves closer Gene Garber {{to work on}} his side-arm/submarine delivery. He used the <b>spring</b> <b>work</b> to continue to gain arm strength, and began the season on the Braves active roster. After a few shaky appearances in April, Moylan began to find more consistency during May, settling into his role as the team's primary 7th inning specialist. Between the 80 appearances he made in 2007 and the 87 appearances in 2009, he became the first Braves pitcher to have two seasons with 80 or more games pitched. In addition he did not allow a home run in 2009, setting a Major League Baseball record for the most consecutive appearances to start a season without giving up a home run, eclipsing the record of 73 set by Brian Shouse with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2007.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "ūsiņš" [...] {{has several}} explanations. Old Stender linked that name with ūzām - trousers, which are of yellow color. Stender also called Ūsiņš a bee god. However, {{there is a}} {{conflicting}} data on Ūsiņš being a bee god. 19th century folklore materials called Ūziņš a bee god, while a horse god - Ūsiņš. In late 19th century R. Auniņš called Ūsiņš the god of light, by explaining with the sound [...] "us", which {{can also be found}} in the word - aust (day). Also H. Biezais in his study on a Latvian deity Ūsiņš (God of light in ancient Latvian religion, 1994) come to the conclusion, that Ūsiņš typologically belongs to heavenly deities, and the specific features allowed him to be considered as god of light. On the other hand Jānis Endzelīns felt, that the word ūsiņš has no Latvian origin, but was borrowed from a Germanic word - husing (home spirit). After some time Endzelīns reflects on and considers, that the word ūsiņš derives from a Russian word усень or овсень and that the same deity was borrowed from Russian people. While Vladimir Toporov in his studies concludes, that Ūsiņš is an ancient and mythical deity of several nations. Folk songs expressed visible merging process of Ūsiņš and Jurģi. According to older writings Jurģi Day on 23 April was also known as Ūsiņš Day, which were mainly related {{to the beginning of the}} <b>spring</b> <b>work,</b> resuming to shepherd livestock and pieguļa.|$|E
