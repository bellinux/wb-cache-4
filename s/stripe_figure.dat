His prior chest x-ray shows only mild thickening of the right paraspinal <b>stripe</b> (<b>Figure</b> 1). Chest x-ray on admission 10 years later shows a large right mixed density paramediastinal mass silhouetting the right pulmonary artery and right paratracheal <b>stripe</b> (<b>Figure</b> 2). This was confirmed to be a massive esophagus on thoracic CT scan (Figure 3). The patient was eventually diagnosed with achalasia. A number of disorders can present with a massive esophagus including achalasia, esophagectomy with colonic interposition, scleroderma, esophageal carcinoma with stricture, and esophagitis with stricture (1). Diagnostic imaging findings using fluroscopy, CT and X-ray can help differentiate these disorders. A massive esophagus due to achalasia is smooth walled with symmetric tapering to a "bird-beak" deformity and a chest x-ray may initially be normal. Colonic interposition is evident by colonic haustra. A dilated esophagus due...|$|E
40|$|Wood is a {{very popular}} and {{preferred}} material for many applications because of its remarkable decorative peculiarities. A very interesting feature related to the appearance of wood is called ribbon stripe or <b>stripe</b> <b>figure.</b> <b>Stripe</b> <b>figure</b> {{is perceived as a}} series of longitudinal parallel stripes which alternate in colour shade. When the sample is slightly rotated, the bright stripes become dark and vice versa. This gonio-apparent effect provides the wood with a very dynamic appearance, distinguishing the material from alternatives such as laminate. In this paper, <b>stripe</b> <b>figure</b> is quantified by measuring and analyzing the absolute spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) for different incident and viewing angle combinations. In a first step, perpendicular illumination is used and the viewing angle is varied in four half planes. Asymmetric BRDF values are found if the observation plane is parallel with the ribbon direction, in contrast to the behaviour in the plane perpendicular to it. In a second experiment, both incident and viewing angle are changed simultaneously, simulating the general observer behaviour when assessing the appearance of the sample. Important differences in lightness between two adjacent positions on the sample are recorded when slightly rotating the sample around an axis perpendicular to the ribbon pattern, revealing the characteristic contrast flop. Again, if the other rotation direction is chosen, almost no variation is observed. These observations {{can be attributed to the}} particular orientation of the fibres in combination with the external reflectance at the finishing top layer. Analogous effects are present in the hue, especially on the yellow-blue axis, but are almost absent on the red-green axis. The quantitative results reported in this paper can be used for camera-based selection of wood samples and to improve the quality of computer renderings of these natural materials. status: publishe...|$|E

2500|$|The {{majority}} of glued joints in the instrument use animal hide glue rather than common white glue {{for a number}} of reasons. Hide glue is capable of making a thinner joint than most other glues, it is reversible (brittle enough to crack with carefully applied force, and removable with very warm water) when disassembly is needed, and since fresh hide glue sticks to old hide glue, more original wood can be preserved when repairing a joint. (More modern glues must be cleaned off entirely for the new joint to be sound, which generally involves scraping off some wood along with the old glue.) Weaker, diluted glue is usually used to fasten the top to the ribs, and the nut to the fingerboard, since common repairs involve removing these parts. The purfling running {{around the edge of the}} spruce top provides some protection against cracks originating at the edge. It also allows the top to flex more independently of the rib structure. Painted-on [...] purfling on the top is usually a sign of an inferior instrument. The back and ribs are typically made of maple, most often with a matching <b>striped</b> <b>figure,</b> referred to as flame, fiddleback, or tiger stripe.|$|R
30|$|Additionally, high {{resolution}} contact mode AFM measurements can provide lattice resolution {{even in the}} suspended region of the MoS 2 flakes which demonstrates the very clean nature of our fabrication technique. Figure 1 d, e shows two lateral force maps (friction images) obtained in the suspended and the supported parts of the MoS 2 flake shown in Figure 1 c. The atomic resolution can be better resolved in the suspended region of the MoS 2 flake (Figure 1 d), while in the supported part, the frictional force image mainly follows parallel <b>stripes</b> (<b>Figure</b> 1 e). We have employed a two-dimensional Tomlinson model [19] to simulate the frictional force image measured in the supported part of the nanolayer (see inset in Figure 1 e), finding a remarkable qualitative agreement. Interestingly, by reducing a 25 % in {{the depth of the}} surface potential employed in the simulation the calculated friction force image qualitatively matches the one measured in the suspended part of the MoS 2 nanomembrane (Figure 1 d). This difference in the frictional force image can be due to a slight modification of the MoS 2 lattice induced by the pre-tension of the suspended part of the sheet. However, a detailed analysis of the tension dependence of frictional force images and their interpretation, although interesting, {{is beyond the scope of}} this work.|$|R

It had a triple doorway divided by columns and was built from adobe covered with plaster, the columns and walls on eithers side of the doorways were painted with decorations, traces of red, yellow and blue were found by archaeologists, these colours were applied to designs marked out onto a thin cap of clay with a pointed instrument. The quality of the work was very fine and indicated execution by a specialised artist. There were ten painted figures {{on the front of the}} building with further murals on the back. The designs consist of two rows of discs on top of a row of vertical <b>stripes</b> with <b>figures</b> painted against the striped background with the discs above them. The painted figures are performing various actions, one of which is tongue piercing, and they probably represent a Kaqchikel ritual in progress. The painted murals are very poorly preserved due to deterioration caused by damp combined with damage caused by tree roots. The style of the paintings is very similar to that of Postclassic Mixtec art.

40|$|The thesis investigates how {{the designs}} woven in Andean {{textiles}} {{make up a}} symbolic language which both communicates information about those who wear them and demonstrates their desire to balance the opposing forces which are believed to govern their world. All textile elements share this communicative function and the thesis examines the significance of spin, colour and layout in the textile {{as a whole and}} in the individual designs. Textile terminology is drawn from fieldwork, the literature and from early Aymara and Quechua lexicons. The contemporary designs examined were personally observed in Bolivar in 1982 / 3 and 1986; the thesis suggests their derivation from colonial designs and discusses their possible iconographic content. Part one shows the significance of clothing as a statement of identity and describes briefly the weaving techniques and figures typical of the Bolivar area. Part two shows how cloth is seen as a vital, three-dimensional object and how in weaving as in the other plastic arts designs are encoded with abstract concepts fundamental to the traditions of a social group. Part three examines how certain colour combinations represent social, political or cosmic tensions and how their arrangement attempts to manipulate and control the energy generated by them. In particular it investigates how colour represents the circulation of suerte, or fortune, many of the names of which are also terms for colour combinations similar to those used in textiles. It also shows how specific elements such as <b>stripes</b> and <b>figured</b> designs act as metaphors through which the textile becomes a map or record of social, ritual and cosmic space...|$|R

T-shirts are a representative casual wear item worn in everyday life, especially among young people. The association of traditional ele-ments and public goods such as T-shirts effects the diffusion of the Korean image into global society. Through the whole design process, target groups and design concepts were determined first: collegiate {{students as well as}} clean, natural, refined, simple and sporty image, respectively. Subsequently, Dokkaebi, lotus, Dang-cho, dragon and Taegeuk patterns were selected as traditional pattern sources.

40|$|A square {{composed}} of horizontal lines appears taller and narrower than an identical square {{made up of}} vertical lines. Reporting this illusion, Hermann von Helmholtz noted that such illusions, in which filled space seems to be larger than unfilled space, were common in everyday life, adding the observation that ladies' frocks with horizontal <b>stripes</b> make the <b>figure</b> look taller. As this assertion runs counter to modern popular belief, we have investigated whether vertical or horizontal stripes on clothing should make the wearer appear taller or fatter. We find that a rectangle of vertical stripes needs to be extended by 7. 1 % vertically to match {{the height of a}} square of horizontal stripes and that a rectangle of horizontal stripes must be made 4. 5 % wider than a square of vertical stripes to match its perceived width. This illusion holds when the horizontal or vertical lines are on the dress of a line drawing of a woman. We have examined the claim that these effects apply only for 2 -dimensional figures in an experiment with 3 -D cylinders and find no support for the notion that horizontal lines would be ‘fattening’ on clothes. Significantly, the illusion persists when the horizontal or vertical lines are on pictures of a real half-body mannequin viewed stereoscopically.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a quantum particle bound by an accelerating delta-functional potential is investigated. Three cases are considered, using the reference frame moving {{along with the}} δ-function, in which the acceleration is converted into the additional linear potential. (i) A stationary regime, which corresponds to a resonance state, with a minimum degree of delocalization, supported by the accelerating potential trap. (ii) A pulling scenario: an initially bound particle follows the accelerating delta-functional trap, within a finite time. (iii) The pushing scenario: the particle, which was initially localized {{to the right of}} the repulsive delta-function, is shoved to the right by the accelerating potential. For the two latter scenarios, the life time of the trapped particle, and the largest velocity to which it can be accelerated while staying trapped, are found. Analytical approximations are developed for the cases of small and large accelerations in the pulling regime, and also for a small acceleration in the stationary situation, and in the regime of pushing. The same regimes may be realized by Airy-like planar optical beams guided by a narrow bending potential channel or crest. Physical estimates are given for an atom steered by a stylus of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), and for the optical beam guided by a bending <b>stripe.</b> Comment: 7 <b>Figures,</b> J. Phys.

5000|$|The {{subject of}} the {{painting}} is a woman sitting in a green and yellow <b>striped</b> armchair. Her <b>figure</b> and the chair take {{up the majority of}} the canvas. She is nude except for sheer, gold-trimmed harem pants that covers her legs and touches the floor. The woman is heavily sexualized by her suggestive pose and how Matisse portrays the curvature of her body. Her breasts are round and idealized. However, the whole body of the sitter is not idealized because she has hair under her arms, which was considered scandalous by contemporary critics. [...] The brushwork in the painting is loose and shows the gestural movements of the artist. The painting has very little spatial depth, forcing the viewer to confront the woman in the foreground. The architectural and decorative elements further focus the viewer on the seated female. The shadows and curvature of her body is accentuated in contrast with the flat rendering of patterns in the planes behind her. The red decorative element, possibly a tapestry or a painting, hanging on the wall and the striped armchair that she is sitting in offer movement to the viewer’s eye. As the viewers gaze is taken around the painting by the geometric shapes to the pattern, and after their gaze glazes over the flat olive wall and muted orange floor the viewer will come to rest upon the reclined female. The air of comfortability that the woman exudes ensures that even as the viewer’s gaze is taken around the painting, it will always land on the female.|$|R
40|$|In {{accord with}} Nambu-Goldstone theorem {{spontaneous}} breaking {{of a global}} continuous symmetry of the system by a mean-field order parameter causes appearance of massless Goldstone bosons, called also gapless Goldstone modes. It is demonstrated below that the theorem can be violated, i. e. the Goldstone modes possess finite gap, {{in the case of}} a novel "Euclidian crystal" (quantum ordered) state of interacting fermions, that was proposed recently mukhin 2011. This result may lead to the important consequences when considered in combination with another peculiar properties of the quantum order parameter (QOP) that where recently found: QOP's Green's function is finite and periodic along the Matsubara's axis, but Wick-rotated to the axis of real frequencies, possesses infinite periodic "chain" of second order poles along this axis mukhin 2011. This property of QOP leads to a remarkable physical consequence: QOP does not scatter anything in Minkowski world ! Hence, the present theory, we believe, may naturally indicate that two effects: "hidden order" revealed in ARPES spectra of fermi-excitations and "neutron resonance" feature at finite frequency in the magnetic (bosonic) excitations spectrum in lightly hole-doped copper oxides, could be emerging fingerprints of the Euclidian crystal state. A peculiar manifestation of the QOP self-consistent solution in the form of non-classical phonon states is described for an "electromagnetic Euclidian crystal" predicted recently mukhin,fistul 2013 in the array of Josephson junctions coupled via electromagnetic field in the superconducting resonator. It is demonstrated that it may constitute a stable state of the system, that, for a particular quantum disordering model, exists inside the stability domain of the classical photonic condensate delimited by the critical value of the quantum disordering strength.

Nevertheless, the information about this era is inadequate because the researches haven’t been taken further.

In 15th century BC the land began to be settled by the Thracians and they had become tho sole owner of the place for a long time is required. However, after the 7th century BC the Thracian domination came to end by the continuous invasions over the years and got into the hands sequentially of Greeks, Persians, Macedonians, Romans and Byzantines. Although the region has a very old past, a city {{had never been able to}} be built on the area where today’s Uzunkopru exists because it’d been covered with vast swamps and dense forests till the Ottomans. That’s why, the closest city to today’s settlement built in the region is Plotinopolis, established by the Roman Emperor Trajan (AD 53-117) on the banks of the Maritsa River between Uzunkopru and Didymoteicho in Greek Thrace, that was named after Trajan’s wife Pompeia Plotina and became a bishopric, suffragan of Adrianople. This ancient city is also called Old Uzunkopru. Eventually, the region was captured from the Byzantine by the Ottoman Empire after the conquest of Adrianopolis (renamed Edirne) in the Sazlıdere War in 1363 and only afterwards it could be possible for Uzunkopru city to be established.|$|R
40|$|I. Histologica! {{studies of}} calf skin In {{the case of}} tanning of leather and manufaeturing of gelatin, the skin always must be soaked in lime solution. Then the tissues and organs in the skin will {{make a lot of}} morphologically {{remarkable}} changes. Accordingly, in th first place the writer has observed minutely the tissues and organs of the backskin of the Holstein calf. The principal results obtained are as follows : 1. There was no great difference between the skin of the Holstein species and that of others. The former was composed of epidermis, corium and subcutaneous tissue that existed in animals skin in general. 2. The lucidum layer on that epidermis of the back skin, the appearance of which had not been reported, was discovered in this reserch. 3. The papillate layer of calf skin, occupying 45 ^ of all skin thickness, was comparatively thicker than that of the matured cattle skin, -while the reticular layer of calf skin was relatively thin. It was recognized distinctly that the sweat gland and the hair of calf skin were inferior in development to those of the matured cattle skin. 4. There was a little difference between the type of. collagen fibre in the papillate layer ani that in the reticular layer. The rcil form of the so-called grain layer was morphologically not yet clearly recognized. In the; collagen fibre, the kittsubstance was recognized. 5. In the case of the elastic fibre, it was picked up ani left alone for a long time, special <b>striped</b> <b>figures</b> similar to micula emerged {{in the center of the}} elastic fibre. From a distributing point of view, it was considered that there were twojtypes in the elastic fibre. II. On the change of the calf skin during the process of liming It was researched how the tissue of t'le skin suffered changes when it was soaked in the lime solution. The results are as follows : 1. When the raw skin was soaked in the saturate! solution of lime, every cellular element of skin took various forms to be dissolved, and most of them vanished within 72 hours. The cells of sweat glands and arectorpili muscles were the earliest, and every call in epidermis the next and the cell, in the hair follicle the last to be solved. 2. The keratin substance which composed the epidermis was dissolved in the lime solution. But layers in the epidermis separated not individually from one another, but together from the part of the corium. In this case the internal part of the epidermis melted and became one membrane-like plate. 3. The kittsubstance amon 3 the tissues Wire dissolved early, and tissues came to be in isolated states. When this state was over the remaining tissues (collagen fibres) swelled and occupied the space which was produced by the separation. 4. The collagen fibres began to swvell immediately after soaking, an 1 increased the degree of expansion as time passed, but began to separate from one another after about 72 hours owing to the dissolution of kittsubstanca. At the same time the fine fibres also begin to swell ani continued to separate from one another for about 7 days. Afterwards the spaces were not recognized because of the swelling. ^The collagen fibres in papillate layers was earlier in separation and expansion than those in reticular layers. 5. The elastic fibres swelled little by little, and the changes in the form were not recognized so clearly. 6. Some of the cells of the sebaceous gland made little change by lime soaking, except the nuclear change by lims soaking, but the nucleus in those cells made a change of form or was dissolved. It was not possible for the cytoplasma of the cells in raw skin to be stained by acid fuchsin, but they -were stained when soaked in lime solution. 7. The medulla of hairs did not make so much of a chage as others did, but the cells surrounding to support the hairs ･were dissolved, and so the hairs were isolated from one another into a floating condition. Moreover, this floating condition was thought to be enlarged by the spaces of sweat glands. Nevertheless, the hair became fixed by the pressure of the swelled collagen fibre because of the long soaking in the lime solution. 8. According to the facts mentioned above, it was thought best to unhair, after the skin were soaked for 5 or 8 days in lime solution at 18 °C. In comparison with various former theories of unhairing, it was proved that the chief cause of unhairing was the change in the form, produced by collapse of the tissue. III, On the change of fixed calf skin during the process of liming 1. Every tissue and organ in the skin, when it was fixed with formalin, stood against the lime action, and the resistance made a great difference in degree according to the variety of the tissue. 2. It took a long time for the cellular substance of skin to make changes, and it took about 30 days from the day on which it began to show the beginning of change to the dissolution, and each of the processes of change was not equal to each other. It became hard from staining on the fifteenth day or so after being soaked in lime solution. 3. The state of separation of the collagen fibre, from between the epidermis and the corium and from the corium was unsettled and indefinite. Especially the collagen fibres in the reticular layer was indefinite in separation. 4. The kittsubstance in every tissue and organ of the fixed skin grew strong against the lime solution. The floating condition of the collagen fibre and the hair was extremely rarely seen. The suitable time for unhairing cannot be determined, and the complete dehairing does not take place. IV. On the change of skin digested by trypsin 1. Being digested with trypsin, the skin lost the elastic fibres chiefly. That is to say, the fine elastic fibre which was complicated around every tissue and organ in the papillate layer began to vanish at first, and then gradually the large bundles of the elastic fibre in the reticular layer and the telasubcutanea were broken. All the elastic fibres disappeared within 20 hours. * 2. Being digested with the trypsin for. 20 hours, the collagen fibre swelled a little, but remarkable changes were not seen in from. The tissue, composed of keratin, seemed to be denaturated, but no great change was recognized in form. V. Histochemical studies on the reaction in the skin treated by lime solution 1. The collagen fibre degenerated and presented reaction of acidity or neutrality by soaking the raw skin in lime solution. In the case of treating the collagen fibre with silver nitrate, there appeared little dots in stripes. 2. The elastic fibre presented the basic character. That is the elastic fibre combined with lime, formed the protein base, and therefore presented remarkable reactions to the special pigments and was stained better than in the case of raw skin. Silver grains were not recognized in the place Where the elastic fibre existed. 3. The epidermistic tissue (including epidermis) also presented basic character by liming. 4 - The contents of the sebum cutaneum in the sebaceous gland are very complicated, and the reaction by lime solution is not always equal. It was considered that the sebum cutaneum seldom saponifies. The effect of taking fat away by liming was considered to be chiefly in breaking the supporting tissue...|$|R

In recognising the »Illyrian« character of the tropaeum, of great importance was identification of the tropaeum head dress, recognised by Schmid firmly as a round leather "field" cap (Figures 4 - 5). This interpretation was accepted by Stemmer, Abramić and others. This detail was analysed in a measured way by Pochmarski, who also accepted it, but also noticed that the analogies presented (by Schmid) have many mutually unrelatable details. Even a superfluous view shows the presented object is most logically identifiable as a cap, although some alternative interpretations are possible as well. If not as the originator, than at least as a predecessor of such presentation, could have been taken the tropaeum at the inner frieze of the temple of Apollo Sosianus in Rome (Figure 13). It is presented on the triumphant sedan-chair, also dressed in a tunic and a robe, its head dress obviously being a thick woollen cap. Identical is even the horizontal groove identified by Schmid as a stripe at the statue of Solin. Presentation of the tropaeum in the Apollo 2 ̆ 7 s temple is an example how the appearance of a tropaeum may, but does not have to, relate to a particular military victory. It is deemed, namely, that the presented tropaeum makes part of procession of the famous August 2 ̆ 7 s triple triumph of 29 BC. Since there are no recognisable symbols of Actium and Egypt, it can be rightly assumed that this is about a victory in Illyricum, moreover so since we have learned from Dio Cassius that on the first day of the triumph August celebrated his victories over the Pannonians and the Delmatae, the Iapodes and their neighbours, but he also reports that victories over some other Germanic and Gallic peoples were celebrated as well. Doubting the Schmid 2 ̆ 7 s thesis that the tropaeum is covered with an "Illyrian" cap still does not exclude the possibility of the statue belonging to Tiberius and that the tropaeum really symbolises victories over the Pannonians and the Delmatae. There are a few formative and iconographic elements having very firm foothold and comparisons with statues dated to the Tiberian period: form and decoration of the metal pteriges (Figures 8 - 11), execution of the double shoulder leather <b>stripes</b> (<b>Figure</b> 3), and in particular the hairstyle of the right side Victoria in the tropaeum decoration scene (Figure 5). The two former details are found together, for instance, at the statue of unknown origin kept in Louvre depot and dated to the Tiberian period. The hairstyle of the right hand Victoria was fashionable over a very long period of time, the side fringes covering the ears (with no curls) with locks falling down the neck and a somewhat wider knot at the back of the head are typical for the Tiberian period. On the statue there are also some details that could shift the dating a few decades later. Two of these are of particular interest: execution of the acanthus tendrils with the ending rosettes with two rows of leaves around the pestle (known from statues of the later, Julian-Claudian origin, e. g. of Minturn, Verona, etc.) and traces of drilling at the tropaeum trunk, decoration of the front upper and other pteriges, here present to an extent greater than at some later statues. It is interesting that execution of the three drilled holes in the trunk of the statue of Solin is repeated at the statue of Trajan from Gabi, today in Louvre, deemed by Stemmer to be of Flavian origin and by Boschung perhaps a bit older (Figure 14). Although being a topic of a lesser importance, presentation of the Solus 2 ̆ 7 team in the upper part, with the dog jump motif as the separator, and with interesting iconographic comparisons, too, makes a possible orientation point for a somewhat later dating (Figure 3). According to Schmid, making the statue of several sections is aimed to its easier transportation, that would mean that it was imported to Salona, that is, that its creation after a bronze original took place most probably in Rome. Because of its exceptional quality, Stemmer deems it to be produced in workshops of the city of Rome. Pochmarski concludes that the two sections of the torso have been made by two different sculptors within a single workshop (!) and that such practice indicates rather a local manufacture of Salona (!) that can be dated to the later Augustan period. Although appealing, such a theory seems overhasty and lacking footholds. The thesis on two sorts of marble is based on visual identification only, and even if correct it cannot make proof of local manufacturing. With regard to the statue body being made of two sections, the best examples of this technique are just in the imperial sculptures of the province 2 ̆ 7 s coastal area, among the statues of heroic nudity and in togas (e. g. Salona, Osor, Vis, Narona). Of these, those from the sanctuary in Narona are made of Greek marble (Pentelic and cipollino marbles) and are certainly imported. Statistics of geographical presence of statues of the scheme V and presentations of the Solus 2 ̆ 7 team, too, support the thesis on the statue originating outside Dalmatia, most probably from Rome...|$|R
