[...] He received top billing after the film, but while he acknowledged {{the importance of the}} role to his career, he always disputed that it changed the way heroes and leading men were portrayed; he cited Clark Gable's slapping of Barbara Stanwyck six months earlier (in Night Nurse) as more important.

However, when <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up,</b> Mal still believed that she was dreaming. In an attempt to [...] "wake up" [...] for real, Mal committed suicide and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same. Facing a murder charge, Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children in the care of Professor Miles.|$|E
500|$|... "Tik Tok" [...] {{was written}} by Kesha, {{alongside}} Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco and was co-produced by Luke and Blanco. Kesha said the inspiration behind the song came from coming home half-drunk and stumbling after a night out of partying. She would then write down {{a few words to}} a song, then the following morning she would wake up with the story waiting to be told. The opening line came from an experience where <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> surrounded by [...] "beautiful women", leading to her imagining P. Diddy being in a similar scenario. She then proceeded to bring the song to her producer Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco and the song was written. Four hours later, Diddy called Luke and said that they should do a song together. Diddy came to the studio later that day to contribute his lines and the collaboration was completed.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} opens with Williams waking up {{on a couch}} next to an unnamed {{sleeping}} male and writes a note that says [...] "I'm sorry". From there she walks to a room and hugs her father, who's mentioned in song. A conversation ensues with Williams taking a photo of someone presumed to be her mother. The video continues with Williams in her room staring at the photo on a mirror, singing about how love, [...] "does not exist." [...] She moves through a costume closet and into a restaurant set, where a rotating cast of men pose as her date. Then into the next room, there's a wedding — everyone is wearing white (the other band members in attendance), but Williams comes dressed in black; she flees the scene from where the bride enters. During the chorus of the song, the clip cuts to the scenes where Williams is lying down on a giant pile of Valentine-themed cards. Throughout the video, clips of Williams singing {{with the rest of}} Paramore in a dim-lighted background are shown. In the video's final moments, Williams spots the same male <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> to {{at the beginning of the}} video in the crowd at a rock show. After fantasizing of the two being together through all sets from the start of the video, she makes her way back through the various rooms to the original set in the beginning. When Williams sings [...] "And I'm on my way to believing", she returns to the couch where the male is still asleep, and hides the note she wrote in her pocket as she lies back down next to him.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 29, 1910. It states: [...] "Marie is the tiny daughter of a well to do farmer. On Halloween her father, to amuse her, picks a pumpkin that she selects, and fashions a jack-o-lantern out of it. Her new toy pleases the child immensely, and at once takes a place in her affections equal to that held by her dollie. So it is natural {{that she should be}} thinking about the two of them when she is tucked into bed and falls asleep. Perhaps that was why the queen of the fairies came to her and invited her to a Halloween party that her loyal subjects were giving in their woodland retreat. And so that Marie would be perfectly happy, not feel embarrassed among strangers, the queen asked Dollie and Pumpkin to be her guests also. And, as a further mark of favor, she waved her hand, and Dollie and Pumpkin could run around and talk as well as Marie could. It certainly made it more enjoyable for the little girl. A fairy Halloween party is one of the finest things going in the amusement line, and only very nice and very good little girls are invited to them. As Marie filled these requirements, she had a perfectly glorious time, but was inclined to weep when <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> later in her own little bed, and found that her toys had lost their miraculous gift of life. But it consoled her somewhat to have them, for they served as reminders of her wonderful evening. And perhaps the fairies will ask her to attend another party later. If they do, she has decided that Pumpkin and Dollie must have their shares of the good times as before." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Tik Tok" [...] was {{directed}} by Syndrome. It was shot in Kesha's old neighborhood and the car featured in the video belongs to her. Kesha explained the experience saying, [...] "the video I'm excited about because I actually got to shoot it in my old neighborhood and the guy driving my gold car {{is a friend of}} mine". The video's party scene was shot in her friend's house, which they refer to as the [...] "drunk tank". The singer said [...] "the last party scene is in this house called the drunk tank, which is one of my friend's houses that we all go party at. So I like it cause its super-honest and genuine." [...] The video begins with Kesha waking in a bathtub in a home as she stumbles out and begins to look for a toothbrush in the restroom. She makes her way down a staircase looking at the pictures lining the wall. Kesha makes her way to the kitchen and walks in on a family who are having breakfast, startling them. She shrugs and then leaves the home as the family gets up and follows her. When she arrives at the sidewalk, she picks up a gold bicycle lying against a fallen fence and rides off. Kesha meets a group of children and trades the bicycle for their boombox. The video cuts to another scene where she rejects a guy and is picked up by a man portrayed by Simon Rex who drives her in a gold 1978 Trans Am. They are pulled over by the police, who handcuff Kesha. The scene then pans to her singing while standing in the T-top as she dangles the handcuffs hanging from her left arm. The next scene shows Kesha in an empty room filled with glitter. She then attends a party with Rex for the final scene. The video comes to an end with Kesha lying in a different bathtub from the one <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> in. The official music video has received over 360 million views on YouTube as of July 2017.|$|E

The following morning, <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> and found her infant son unresponsive and cold to the touch. While Grace was covering the case, she infamously dubbed Medrano [...] "Vodka Mom". During one of her shows, Grace brought a bottle of vodka onto her set and poured shots to demonstrate how much Medrano had drunk the night of her son's death. In June 2012, Medrano was charged with two counts of second-degree manslaughter. If convicted on both counts, Medrano would have faced a maximum of ten years in prison.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first single}} was {{completed}} in autumn 2000, entitled [...] "Ya Soshla S Uma" [...] (later released in English as [...] "All the Things She Said"). It was not physically and formally released until December 2000.

Elena Kiper has been credited with the song, explaining that the idea came to her when she fell asleep at her dentist's office and had a dream in which she kissed another woman. <b>She</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> saying out loud, [...] "Я сошла с ума!"

At this time, around 20 masked men kicked {{in the door and}} started firing in the house. As Ellen walked down the steps, she was shot at point blank range. She and her unborn baby were murdered, along with her brother, Charles O'Donell. The matriarch of the house, Margaret O'Donnell, was pistol whipped by the assailants and they roughed up the boarders Mrs. O'Donnell kept. Ellen's husband, Charles McAllister, managed to escape, as did James O'Donnell, another O'Donnell sibling, and James McAllister, brother of Ellen's husband, Charles. It was said the attack occurred because the O'Donnell family were suspected members of the Molly Maguires. Ellen's body and that of her brother were taken to Tamaqua by train. Upon arrival, the corpses were packed in ice and stored overnight in the train station to await burial at old St. Jerome's Cemetery. Ellen's sister, Mary Ann, was married to the John [...] "Black Jack" [...] Kehoe, who history dubbed [...] "The King of the Molly Maguires".|$|E
2500|$|In May 2008, Davis free soloed the North Face (5.11b) of the Castleton Tower, {{making her}} {{perhaps the first}} woman to have free-soloed at the 5.11+ grade. The route is rated 5.11a and is [...] of climbing. It is a famous {{formation}} in Castle Valley, Utah. After Davis climbed it, she BASE jumped from the top. In describing this climb, she referred to her climb and jump as [...] "the cleanest possible style". Davis prepared by climbing the route multiple times in April and waiting for the perfect weather conditions. BASE jumping requires specific conditions, especially around Moab, where the cliffs are so short. On 4 May, the weather and Davis' mental state coincided and she was ready to free solo the route. Although <b>she</b> <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> with a cold, for her the mental state was more important than the physical. However, while climbing she accidentally stepped on the cuff of her pants, which she unusually had unrolled due to cool temperatures and slipped; because she had such good hand and arm placement, however, she did not fall. The climb was filmed by a close friend, Jim Hurst. Davis has {{said in an interview that}} while she had always refused to have her free solos filmed in the past because she has known him so long and because he knows how she climbs, having him film was not an imposition. There was no communication between them during the filming.|$|E
