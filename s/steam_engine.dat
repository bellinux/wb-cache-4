5|$|Just {{outside the}} main walls, the castle mills had become {{increasingly}} ineffective from the 16th century onwards {{because of a}} reduction in the flow of the rivers driving the water-wheels. As a result, in 1778 they were rebuilt with a new <b>steam</b> <b>engine</b> to drive the machinery; this <b>steam</b> <b>engine</b> caused considerable discomfort to the prisoners affected by the smoke and noise.|$|E
5|$|In Newhey is the Ellenroad Steam Museum, the {{retained}} engine house, boiler house, chimney and <b>steam</b> <b>engine</b> of Ellenroad Mill, {{a former}} 1892-built cotton mill designed by Sir Philip Stott, 1st Baronet. Now operated as an industrial heritage centre, the mill itself {{is no longer}} standing, but the <b>steam</b> <b>engine</b> (the world's largest working steam mill engine) is maintained and steamed once a month by the Ellenroad Trust. The museum has the only fully working cotton mill engine with its original steam-raising plant in the world. Ellenroad Mill produced fine cotton yarn using mule spinning.|$|E

5000|$|Jensen <b>Steam</b> <b>Engines</b> is a {{manufacturer}} of model/toy <b>steam</b> <b>engines,</b> located in Jeannette, PA USA. Established in 1932 by Tom Jensen Sr. They are still making <b>steam</b> <b>engines</b> using traditional technology and methods.|$|R
50|$|The use {{of large}} Stirling {{water-tube}} boilers and stationary compound <b>steam</b> <b>engines</b> was also rare in sawmills, which generally used single-cylinder <b>steam</b> <b>engines</b> or portable <b>steam</b> <b>engines,</b> and this example may be unique in Australia.|$|R
50|$|From mines to mills, <b>steam</b> <b>engines</b> {{found many}} uses {{in a variety}} of industries. The {{introduction}} of <b>steam</b> <b>engines</b> improved productivity and technology, and allowed the creation of smaller and better engines. After Richard Trevithick's development of the high-pressure engine, transport-applications became possible, and <b>steam</b> <b>engines</b> found their way into boats, railways, farms and road vehicles. <b>Steam</b> <b>engines</b> are an example of how changes brought by industrialization led to even more changes in other areas.|$|R
5|$|Dreadnoughts were {{propelled}} by {{two to four}} screw propellers. Dreadnought herself, and all British dreadnoughts, had screw shafts driven by steam turbines. The first generation of dreadnoughts built in other nations used the slower triple-expansion <b>steam</b> <b>engine</b> which had been standard in pre-dreadnoughts.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Kommandøren was modernized at Stavanger Støberi & Dok in Stavanger, {{gaining a}} new boiler for the <b>steam</b> <b>engine</b> and being painted white. In January the next year, she ran aground at Rongevær in the Fensfjord. She ran aground again in 1913, in Herdlefjorden.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October 1831, some wagons {{ran away}} on an {{inclined}} plane, worked by a stationary <b>steam</b> <b>engine,</b> at Avenhambrow. The brakesman jumped off but was run over {{and killed by}} wagons being drawn up the incline on an adjacent line.|$|E

50|$|With {{somewhat}} different functions, snifting valves {{were also used}} in atmospheric <b>steam</b> <b>engines</b> and hydraulic rams. They are not generally used in later stationary <b>steam</b> <b>engines,</b> road engines, or marine engines.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, diesel railcars {{supplemented}} the <b>steam</b> <b>engines</b> on {{the passenger}} services. In the 1980s, 10 Hitachi-built diesel-hydraulic locomotives were delivered and replaced the railcars and remaining <b>steam</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
5|$|The biplane that chased Hannay was a 1916 Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a, his {{apartment}} {{was in an}} Art Deco building and 1950s rail carriages were being pulled by a <b>steam</b> <b>engine</b> built in 1927.|$|E
5|$|The first Curry Moor {{pumping station}} {{was built in}} 1864, to house a <b>steam</b> <b>engine</b> and pump. A cottage for the {{operator}} was built next to {{it at the same}} time. This installation lasted until 1955, when a new pumphouse was constructed to house two diesel pumps. The <b>steam</b> <b>engine</b> was retained for historical reasons, and is located in part of the new building. The diesel pumps were supplemented by an electric pump in 1983, and a programme of refurbishment was carried out in 2008, which included {{the construction of a new}} outfall into the river.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Frank Shuman, a U.S. inventor, {{engineer}} and solar energy pioneer, built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, {{which has a}} lower boiling point than water, and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a <b>steam</b> <b>engine.</b> In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company {{with the intent of}} building larger solar power plants. He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E. Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. Shuman then constructed a full-scale <b>steam</b> <b>engine</b> powered by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the <b>steam</b> <b>engines</b> produced by Garrett were portable engines - combined with their fixed <b>steam</b> <b>engines</b> and semi-portables, they represented 89% of the works' output.|$|R
25|$|Electric motors {{were several}} times more {{efficient}} than small <b>steam</b> <b>engines</b> because central station generation was {{more efficient than}} small <b>steam</b> <b>engines</b> and because line shafts and belts had high friction losses.|$|R
50|$|Compounding was {{particular}} used on stationary <b>steam</b> <b>engines,</b> marine <b>steam</b> <b>engines,</b> and on some but by {{no means}} all steam locomotives starting from the 1850s, particularly but not only in continental Europe.|$|R

5|$|Tatchell leased {{the mill}} to his {{son-in-law}} John Sherrin, who inherited the mill in 1824 following Tatchell's death. When Sherrin died, the mill passed to his three sons, although only one, Robert, worked the mill. Simon Spearing became the miller in 1869. He was later assisted {{by his son}} William, who lost an arm when he was thirteen due to an accident at a watermill in Low Ham. The mill was acquired by Adam Sherrin in 1881 and owned by his family until 1902. By the late 1880s, the mill was being rented by George Parker. He added a portable <b>steam</b> <b>engine</b> as auxiliary power. It drove one pair of stones. The mill was damaged by storms in 1897 or 1898 and after that was only powered by the <b>steam</b> <b>engine,</b> which had been installed in 1894, rather than the wind. The bakehouse ceased to be used around this time.|$|E

5|$|The {{action of}} this {{principle}} is exactly {{like that of}} the centrifugal governor of the <b>steam</b> <b>engine,</b> which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it would make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering existence difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow.|$|E
5|$|The final {{evolution}} of ironclad propulsion was {{the adoption of}} the triple-expansion <b>steam</b> <b>engine,</b> a further refinement which was first adopted in , laid down in 1885 and commissioned in 1891. Many ships also used a forced draught to get additional power from their engines, and this system was widely used until the introduction of the steam turbine in the mid-1900s (decade).|$|E

5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in <b>steam</b> <b>engine</b> boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, Providence {{was one of}} the wealthiest cities in the United States. Immigrant labor powered one of the nation's largest {{industrial}} manufacturing centers. Providence was a major manufacturer of industrial products from steam engines to precision tools to silverware, screws, and textiles.
