40|$|Abstract. Activated carbon, zeolite and {{titanium}} dioxide are wildly used for removing the organic compounds in waste water. Although, these materials exhibit high performance (in powder form), reclaiming {{of these materials}} from the waste water treatment system is still difficult. The objective {{of this study is}} to fabricate hollow composite cylinder activated carbon-zeolite samples which were used as a porous substrate. Various ratios of activated carbon, zeolite NaA and ball clay were mixed with special binder to form dough before extruded to hollow cylindrical shape. The hollow cylindrical samples were cut into 2. 5 cm long and then were fired at 600 °C for 2 hours under 5 %CO 2 +N 2 atmosphere.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the atmospheric refraction on the geometric accuracy of airborne photogrammetric images was already considered {{in the days of}} analogue photography. The effect {{is a function of the}} varying refractive index on the path from the ground to the image sensor. Therefore the effect depends on the height over ground, the view zenith angle and the atmospheric constituents. It is leading to a gradual increase of the scale towards the borders of the image, i. e. a magnification takes place. Textbooks list a shift of several pixels at the borders of standard wide angle images. As it was the necessity of that time when images could only be acquired at good weather conditions, the effect was calculated using <b>standard</b> <b>atmospheres</b> <b>for</b> good atmospheric conditions, leading to simple empirical formulas. Often the pixel shift caused by refraction was approximated as linear with height and compensated by an adjustment of the focal length. With the advent of sensitive digital cameras, the image dynamics allows for capturing images at adverse weather conditions. So the {{influence of}} the atmospheric profiles on the geometric accuracy of the images has to be investigated and the validity of the standard correction formulas has to be checked. This paper compares the results from the standard formulas by Saastamoinen with the results calculated from a broad selection of atmospheres obtained from radiosonde profile data. The geometric deviation is calculated by numerical integration of the refractive index as a function of the height using the refractive index formula by Ciddor. It turns out that the effect of different atmospheric profiles (including inversion situations) is generally small compared to the overall effect except at low camera heights. But there the absolute deviation is small. Since the necessary atmospheric profile data are often not readily available for airborne images a formula proposed by Saastamoinen is verified that uses only camera height, the pressure at the ground and the camera level, and the temperature at the camera level...|$|R
40|$|Reliable {{reference}} profiles {{and estimates}} of variability are {{a necessity for}} a variety of processes relating to ENVISAT including the development of key aspects and inputs for the operational processor for the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding. MIPAS reference atmospheres have therefore been produced in two forms, namely <b>standard</b> <b>atmospheres</b> <b>for</b> modelling and error analysis for typical atmospheric situations and the IG 2 seasonal climatologies for initial guess profiles used as part of the operational processing. The reference states cover 36 species on a common altitude, pressure, and temperature grid from 0 to 120 km, and include both means and estimates of variability (maximum, minimum and one sigma values). This paper describes V 3. 1 of the <b>standard</b> <b>atmospheres</b> and V 4. 0 of the IG 2 atmospheres which are the current versions of the reference atmospheres. Particular attention is paid to the MIPAS operational geophysical products (pressure/temperature, H 2 O, O 3, CH 4, N 2 O, HNO 3 and NO 2) and to CO 2 whose mixing ratio is required for the retrieval of pressure and temperature. A dynamic representation of CO 2 is presented which shows the presence of CO 2 gradients in the troposphere and the lower stratosphere. Since these atmospheres have been produced independently of MIPAS data, it is also possible to compare the data to the MIPAS operational products and derive valuable information on both the reference atmospheres and on MIPAS data products themselves. This process has been performed for V 4. 61 /V 4. 62 data from the year 2003 as part of the MIPAS validation activity. It is demonstrated that the agreement between the MIPAS mean data and the reference atmospheres is very good in mid-latitudes and the tropics, verifying these data to first order. There is also reasonable agreement in standard deviations between the IG 2 atmospheres and the corresponding sigmas calculated from the MIPAS data. Knowledge of tropospheric concentrations of CH 4 and N 2 O is used to examine the accuracy of the MIPAS data and their susceptibility to cloud effects. It is shown that for the highest accuracy, MIPAS data should be filtered with cloud index values of 2. 5 for N 2 O and 3. 5 for CH 4. Once such filtering has been performed, the MIPAS data for these species appear to be accurate to within 10 % in the upper troposphere. The use of cloud index data in combination with MIPAS data is recommended for studies of the polar winter stratosphere and the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere...|$|R

Copper is the most commonly used material in the manufacture of printed circuit boards. The negative copper property is its low chemical stability. When a contact is in an atmosphere that contains oxygen, the surface is covered with a layer of copper oxides. This layer deteriorates copper solderability. Another way how to prevent oxidation of copper soldering pads of printed circuit boards is an inert atmosphere. As an inert atmosphere does not contain oxygen and prevents oxidation of the material used on PCB’s. The increasingly frequent introduction of inert atmospheres into soldering processes encourages the introduction of a inert atmosphere also in solderability testing processes...|$|R
