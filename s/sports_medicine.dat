5|$|Diving {{medicine}} {{deals with}} medical research {{on issues of}} diving, the prevention of diving disorders, treatment of diving accident injuries and diving fitness. The field includes {{the effect on the}} human body of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure, and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety. In diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications. Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and <b>sports</b> <b>medicine,</b> and first aid and recognition of symptoms of diving disorders are important parts of diver education.|$|E
5|$|Only three pitchers, Lefty Grove, Warren Spahn, and Early Wynn, {{joined the}} 300win club between 1924 and 1982, {{which may be}} {{explained}} by a number of factors: the abolition of the spitball, World WarII military service, such as Bob Feller's, and the growing importance of the home run in the game. As the home run became commonplace, the physical and mental demands on pitchers dramatically increased, which led to the use of a four-man starting rotation. Between 1982 and 1990, the 300win club gained six members: Gaylord Perry, Phil Niekro, Steve Carlton, Nolan Ryan, Don Sutton and Tom Seaver. These pitchers benefited from the increased use of specialized relief pitchers, an expanded strike zone, and new stadiums, including Shea Stadium, Dodger Stadium and the Astrodome, that were pitcher's parks, which suppressed offensive production. Also, the increasing sophistication of training methods and <b>sports</b> <b>medicine,</b> such as Tommy John surgery, allowed players to maintain a high competitive level for a longer time. Randy Johnson, for example, won more games in his 40s than he did in his 20s.|$|E

5|$|Still {{working for}} Lifemark, Scrushy devised {{a plan for}} an {{outpatient}} diagnostics and rehabilitative health clinic chain. He presented the plan to Lifemark, but the company was unable to act on it due to a company merger that was already underway with American Medical International. Scrushy left Lifemark in 1983 and founded Amcare, Inc within a year. The new company opened its first facility in Little Rock, Arkansas and had initial capital between $50,000-$70,000. With the assistance of four partners from Amcare Inc. and a one million dollar investment by Citicorp Venture Capital, Scrushy took the quickly growing company and founded HealthSouth in 1984. Two years after its founding, HealthSouth became a publicly traded company in 1986. The next year, HealthSouth expanded into two new fields, worker’s compensation and <b>sports</b> <b>medicine,</b> allowing the company to double its earnings and obtain assets close to $100 million. By the early 1990s, the company had expanded even more, with facilities {{in each of the}} 50 U.S states and revenues in excess of $181 million.|$|E

Fourteenth Street divides College Hill to the north, with the athletic fields to the south. Charles Boulevard borders the fields {{to the west and}} Greenville Boulevard borders it to the south. A residential neighborhood and Elmhurst Elementary School are the eastern borders.

South of those facilities is the Cliff Moore Practice Facility which has a pair of natural grass fields and one FieldTurf field designed exclusively for the football team. On the southern border of the practice facility is Clark-LeClair Stadium, which is the men's baseball stadium. It opened in 2005 and seats 3,000 in permanent seating with another 2,000 located in the outfield. At {{the southern end of the}} fields is the Olympic Sports Complex, which include women's soccer stadium, softball stadium, track and field facility, and Olympic Sports Team building. The Olympic Sports Complex was completed in 2011 with a price of $23.4 million. The Smith-Williams Center is a $17 million basketball development and practice facility, opened in 2013. The football stadium is planning for a $40 million upgrade. The upgrades will include a new press, club, and suite areas, and upper deck, all located on the south side. This addition will increase the capacity from 50,000 to 60,000.|$|E

40|$|The ancient {{medical system}} called Ayurveda {{is one of}} the main systems of Alternative {{medicines}} of Indian origin. This is found very practical even in the modern era of medicines due to its unique unbeatable philosophy. We cannot observe any branch of modern system of medicines containing the explanations of <b>sports</b> <b>medicines</b> two centuries ago and obviously the same lack in the literatures of Ayurveda. But the field of medicine is becoming more and more interdisciplinary in nature in this modern era of medicine by incorporating the knowledge from different fields. The field of <b>sports</b> <b>medicines</b> as a separate department was developed recently in the modern medicines. Thus practitioners of Ayurveda also started using the term <b>sports</b> <b>medicines</b> and selected many classical time proven formulations that were found suitable for prescribing for sports injuries of the modern world. They also incorporated many formulations and methods using in different traditional schools related to martial arts and developed many modern medicaments based on them. This paper aims to explain this emerging field by citing certain such traditional formulations and modern medicaments...|$|R
