5|$|Males reach sexual {{maturity}} at 3–5 weeks; females can be fertile {{as early as}} four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults. Females that have never given birth may develop irreversible fusing of the pubic <b>symphysis,</b> a joint in the pelvis, due to calcification which may occur between six and ten months of age. If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal will not widen sufficiently; this may lead to dystocia and death {{as they attempt to}} give birth. Calcification of the female's pubic <b>symphysis</b> (if not bred) is a common myth. The reason for potential calcification is a metabolic disease, like ochronosis. A healthy, normal female guinea pig's pubic <b>symphysis</b> does not calcify.|$|E
5|$|Most of its fins (dorsal, pectoral, pelvic, and caudal) have white tips (juvenile {{specimens}} {{and some}} adults may lack these). Along with white tips, the fins may be mottled, and young specimens can have black marks. A saddle-like marking may be apparent between {{first and second}} dorsal fins. The shark has several kinds of teeth. Those in the mandible (lower jaw) have a thin, serrated tip and are relatively small and triangular (somewhat fang-like). Between 13 and 15 teeth are {{on either side of}} the <b>symphysis.</b> The teeth in the upper jaw are triangular, but much larger and broader with entirely serrated edges 14 or 15 occur along each side of the <b>symphysis.</b> The denticles lie flat and typically have between five and seven ridges.|$|E
5|$|Carnivores {{include both}} pack hunters and solitary hunters. The solitary hunter {{depends on a}} {{powerful}} bite at the canine teeth to subdue their prey, and thus exhibits a strong mandibular <b>symphysis.</b> In contrast, a pack hunter, which delivers many shallower bites, has a comparably weaker mandibular <b>symphysis.</b> Thus, researchers can use {{the strength of the}} mandibular <b>symphysis</b> in fossil carnivore specimens to determine what kind of hunter it wasa pack hunter or a solitary hunterand even how it consumed its prey. The mandibles of canids are buttressed behind the carnassial teeth to enable the animals to crack bones with their post-carnassial teeth (molars M2 and M3). A study found that the mandible buttress profile of the dire wolf was lower than that of the gray wolf and the red wolf, but very similar to the coyote and the African hunting dog. The dorsoventrally weak symphyseal region (in comparison to premolars P3 and P4) of the dire wolf indicates that it delivered shallow bites similar to its modern relatives and was therefore a pack hunter. This suggests that the dire wolf may have processed bone but was not as well adapted for it as was the gray wolf. The fact that the incidence of fracture for the dire wolf reduced in frequency in the late Pleistocene to that of its modern relatives suggests that reduced competition had allowed the dire wolf to return to a feeding behavior involving a lower amount of bone consumption, a behavior for which it was best suited.|$|E
5|$|With its heavyset body, conical bulbous snout, {{and large}} mouth filled with {{protruding}} teeth, the {{bigeye sand tiger}} looks much like the better-known sand tiger shark. The large eyes lack nictitating membranes, and behind them are small spiracles. The corner of the mouth extends to behind {{the level of the}} eyes, and the jaws are highly protrusible. There are 34–43 upper and 37–46 lower tooth rows; these include zero to two rows of small teeth at the upper <b>symphysis</b> (jaw midpoint) and two to four more rows at the lower <b>symphysis.</b> In each half of the upper jaw, the teeth in the first and second rows are large, those in the third and sometimes fourth rows are small, and those in the rows after are large again. Each tooth has a narrow, awl-like central cusp flanked by one smaller cusplet on each side; this contrasts with the smalltooth sand tiger, which has two or three lateral cusplets on each side. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E
5|$|Opisthocoelicaudia {{may have}} been able to rear up on its hindlimbs for foraging, using its tail as a third leg. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka cited several {{skeletal}} features that might have been related to rearing, including the opisthocoelous vertebrae of the anterior part of the tail, which, according to this author, would have made the tail more flexible than in other sauropods. Features of the pelvis, such as the thickened shelf of the acetabulum, the flaring ilia, and the fused pubic <b>symphysis,</b> may have allowed the pelvis to withstand the stress of rearing.|$|E
5|$|The goblin shark has a distinctively {{long and}} flat snout, {{resembling}} a sword blade. The proportional {{length of the}} snout decreases with age. The eyes are small and lack protective nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are spiracles. The large mouth is parabolic in shape. The jaws are highly protrusible and can be extended almost {{to the end of}} the snout, though normally they are held flush against the underside of the head. It has 35–53 upper and 31–62 lower tooth rows. The teeth in the main part of the jaws are long and narrow, particularly those near the <b>symphysis</b> (jaw midpoint), and are finely grooved lengthwise. The rear teeth near the corners of the jaw are small and have a flattened shape for crushing. Much individual variation in tooth length and width occurs, in whether the teeth have a smaller cusplet on each side of the main cusp, and in the presence of toothless gaps at the <b>symphysis</b> or between the main and rear teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with the gill filaments inside partly exposed; the fifth pair is above the origin of the pectoral fins.|$|E
5|$|Holyoak {{provisionally}} {{placed the}} new {{species in the}} same genus as the broad-billed parrot, naming it Lophopsittacus bensoni; the name honours the English ornithologist Constantine W. Benson, {{for his work on}} birds from the Indian Ocean, and in classifying bird collections at Cambridge. Holyoak also mentioned the possibility that the remains could represent a small subspecies of Necropsittacus or a wide-beaked form of Mascarinus, but maintained that they were best considered as belonging to a distinct species. The holotype specimen is a mandibular <b>symphysis,</b> with the specimen number UMZC 577a. Other known remains include upper mandibles, a palatine bone, and tarsometatarsi. The species has since been excavated from the Mare aux Songes swamp on Mauritius, from which subfossils of most of the other endemic bird species have been identified as well.|$|E
5|$|Superficially, the smoothtooth blacktip shark {{resembles the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} (C. melanopterus). It is rather robust in build, with a short and blunt snout. The large {{nostrils}} are preceded by well-developed, triangular flaps of skin. The small, circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The mouth forms a wide arch and has very short furrows at the corners. There are 16 upper and 14–15 lower tooth rows on either side, along with two to three small teeth at the <b>symphysis</b> (center) of either jaw. The teeth are distinctive in shape, having narrow, upright cusps without serrations; finetooth sharks and juvenile spinner sharks are the only other members of Carcharhinus with similar teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are long.|$|E
5|$|The blacknose shark has a slender, {{streamlined}} {{body with a}} long, rounded snout and large eyes. There is a well-developed flap of skin {{in front of each}} nostril, defining the inflow and outflow openings. Twelve to 13 and 11 to 12 tooth rows occur {{on either side of the}} upper and lower jaws, respectively, with one or two teeth at the <b>symphysis</b> (middle). The teeth are triangular and oblique, with serrated edges; the upper teeth are stouter than the lower teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, measuring less a third the length of the first dorsal fin base.|$|E
5|$|The {{silvertip shark}} is a robust and {{streamlined}} species with a moderately long, broad snout and large, round eyes. The five pairs of gill slits are short. There are 12–14 tooth rows {{on each side}} of both jaws, with one or two small teeth at the <b>symphysis</b> (middle of the jaws). The upper teeth are broad with oblique triangular cusps and coarse serrations near the base; the lower teeth have erect cusps with fine serrations. The first dorsal fin is large and triangular, originating above or slightly forward of the free pectoral fin tips. There is a ridge {{between the first and second}} dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are proportionately longer than in most requiem sharks and falcate (sickle-like) in shape, with pointed tips.|$|E
5|$|All ankylosaurs that possess these {{characteristics}} - a narrow predentary; a nearly horizontal quadrate {{that is not}} fused and is oriented 30 degrees from the skull roof; the presence of mandibular condyles that are three times wider than long; premaxillary and dentary teeth that are near a <b>symphysis</b> with {{the front of the}} lower jaw (the predentary); a sacrum arched on top; an acromion process above the midpoint of the scapula to coracoid attachment; a straight ischium with a straight dorsal margin; relatively long, slender limbs; sacral shield armour; and the presence of erect pelvic osteoderms with flat bases - form a clade of basal nodosaurids, the Struthiosaurinae. That set of cranial and postcranial features are only present on genera considered to be in the clade. The features above distinguish Struthiosaurinae from other clades and genera found by other analysis'.|$|E
5|$|Another {{prominent}} early anthropologist, Thomas Wingate Todd, {{was primarily}} responsible {{for the creation of}} the first large collection of human skeletons in 1912. In total, Todd acquired 3,300 human skulls and skeletons, 600 anthropoid skulls and skeletons, and 3,000 mammalian skulls and skeletons. Todd's contributions to the field of anthropology remain in use in the modern era and include various studies regarding suture closures on the skull and timing of teeth eruption in the mandible. Todd also developed age estimates based on physical characteristics of the pubic <b>symphysis.</b> Though the standards have been updated, these estimates are still used by forensic anthropologists to narrow down an age range of skeletonized remains. These early pioneers legitimized the field of anthropology, {{but it was not until}} the 1940s, with the help of Todd's student, Wilton M. Krogman, that forensic anthropology gained recognition as a legitimate subdiscipline.|$|E
5|$|In K. guimarotae, the {{two halves}} of the dentary diverge from each other at an angle of 20° near the front, then 40° near the back. It also bears two convexities {{on the bottom of the}} jaw, one at the third and fourth teeth and another at the eighth to tenth teeth. The latter {{convexity}} is replaced by a concavity in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the top margin of the jaw behind the tooth row slopes upwards in a straight line. The side of the dentary is pitted, albeit much more densely so in K. langenbergensis. Near the back of the dentary in both species, the pits are replaced by longitudinal grooves. On the interior of the jaw, the splenial bears an oval foramen behind the level of the <b>symphysis</b> in both species, and the top of the bone bears a low and roughened crest in K. guimarotae.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} details noted about Iguanodon was that it had the teeth of a herbivorous reptile, {{although}} there {{has not always been}} consensus on how it ate. As Mantell noted, the remains he was working with were unlike any modern reptile, especially in the toothless, scoop-shaped form of the lower jaw <b>symphysis,</b> which he found best compared to that of the two-toed sloth and the extinct ground sloth Mylodon. He also suggested that Iguanodon had a prehensile tongue which could be used to gather food, like a giraffe. More complete remains have shown this to be an error; for example, the hyoid bones that supported the tongue are heavily built, implying a muscular, non-prehensile tongue used for moving food around in the mouth. The giraffe-tongue idea has also been incorrectly attributed to Dollo via a broken lower jaw.|$|E
5|$|Slender and firm-bodied, the quagga {{catshark}} has a {{short and}} flattened {{head with a}} pointed snout. The slightly protruding {{tip of the snout}} is not upturned like in some other Halaelurus species. The anterior rims of the nostrils bear triangular flaps of skin. The small, horizontally oval eyes are placed high on the head and have rudimentary nictitating membranes; below the eyes are thick ridges, and behind them are tiny spiracles. The rather large mouth is curved, with the upper teeth exposed when closed. There are short furrows at the corners of the mouth. The jaws contain 26–28 upper and 27 lower tooth rows on each side; in addition, there are three tooth rows at the upper <b>symphysis</b> (jaw midpoint) and one row at the lower. The teeth have three cusps. The five pairs of gill slits are placed higher than the level of the mouth; the fifth pair are smaller than the rest.|$|E
5|$|The dental {{formula is}} , {{as in all}} lemurids. The toothcomb—a comblike {{structure}} formed by the lower front teeth, characteristic of lemurs and lorisoids—is {{similar to that of}} other lemurids. The two halves of the mandible (lower jaw) do not fuse at the mandibular <b>symphysis.</b> However, there are some differences in tooth morphology from the living brown and ring-tailed lemurs, similar to those between the ruffed lemurs and the other genera. In Pachylemur, the talonid basin (a basin at the back end of the lower molars) is more elongate, and it is not lined by an entoconid cusp. In the first two upper molars, the lingual cingulum (a shelf on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth) is expanded towards the front. The two species differ in details of tooth morphology. P.insignis had narrower lower premolars and molars, and the buccal (outer) cusps on these teeth are located to the front of their lingual counterparts. Relative to the ruffed lemurs, Pachylemur has more massive jaws and larger molars.|$|E
5|$|The viper dogfish has a slender, {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} moderately flattened head with a very short and blunt snout. Behind the large oval eyes are narrow, elliptical spiracles. The nostrils are nearly vertical slits. The jaws are long and narrowly triangular, and can be protruded from the head. The teeth are distinctively fang-like and widely spaced; the most anterior teeth are grooved lengthwise. Six to 10 upper and seven to 10 lower tooth rows occur on each side, along with a single tooth row at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The teeth are largest at the <b>symphysis</b> and decline in size towards the corners of the mouth. When the mouth is closed, the upper symphysial tooth overlaps the lower, while the lateral teeth interlock. Five gill slits are seen, with the fifth pair longer than the others.|$|E
25|$|The pubic <b>symphysis</b> or <b>symphysis</b> pubis is the midline {{cartilaginous}} joint (secondary cartilaginous) uniting {{the superior}} rami {{of the left}} and right pubic bones. It is located anterior to the urinary bladder and superior to it. In males, the suspensory ligament of the penis attaches to the pubic <b>symphysis.</b> In females, the pubic <b>symphysis</b> is intimately close to the clitoris. In normal adults it can be moved roughly 2mm and with 1 degree rotation. This increases for women at the time of childbirth.|$|E
25|$|Metabolic diseases, such as renal osteodystrophy, produce widening, while {{ochronosis}} {{results in}} calcific deposits in the <b>symphysis.</b> Inflammatory diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis, result in bony fusion of the <b>symphysis.</b> Osteitis pubis, {{the most common}} inflammatory disease in this area, is treated with anti-inflammatory medication and rest. Degenerative joint disease of the <b>symphysis,</b> which can cause groin pain, results from instability or from abnormal pelvic mechanics.|$|E
25|$|The two hip {{bones are}} joined {{anteriorly}} at the pubic <b>symphysis</b> by a fibrous cartilage {{covered by a}} hyaline cartilage, the interpubic disk, within which a non-synovial cavity might be present. Two ligaments, the superior and inferior pubic ligaments, reinforce the <b>symphysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{feeling of}} the <b>symphysis</b> pubis giving way.|$|E
25|$|The pubic <b>symphysis</b> widens {{slightly}} {{when the}} legs are stretched far apart. In sports where these movements are often performed, {{the risk of}} a pubic <b>symphysis</b> blockage is high, in which case, after completion of the movement, the bones at the <b>symphysis</b> do not realign correctly and can get jammed in a dislocated position. The resulting pain can be severe, especially when further strain is put upon the affected joint. In most cases, the joint can only be successfully reduced into its normal position by a trained medical professional.|$|E
25|$|Pelvic girdle pain. Hormones and enzymes work {{together}} to produce ligamentous relaxation and widening of the <b>symphysis</b> pubis during the last trimester of pregnancy. Most girdle pain occurs before birthing, and is known as diastasis of the pubic <b>symphysis.</b> Predisposing factors for girdle pain include maternal obesity.|$|E
25|$|During {{pregnancy}} in the human, hormones such as relaxin remodel this ligamentous capsule {{allowing the}} pelvic bones {{to be more}} flexible for delivery. The gap of the <b>symphysis</b> pubis, normally is 4–5mm but during pregnancy {{there will be an}} increase of at least 2–3mm, therefore, it is considered that a total width of up to 9mm between the two bones is normal for a pregnant woman. The <b>symphysis</b> pubis separates to some degree during childbirth. In some women this separation can become a diastasis of the <b>symphysis</b> pubis. The diastasis could be the result of a rapid birth, or a forceps delivery, or may be a prenatal condition. A diastasis of the <b>symphysis</b> pubis is a cause of pelvic girdle pain (PGP). Overall, about 45% of all pregnant women and 25% of all women postpartum suffer from PGP.|$|E
25|$|Symphyseal {{fractures}} are {{a linear}} fractures that {{run in the}} midline of the mandible (the <b>symphysis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Symphysiolysis is {{separation}} or slipping of the <b>symphysis.</b> It {{has been}} estimated to occur in 0.2% of pregnancies.|$|E
25|$|In the newborn, the <b>symphysis</b> pubis is 9–10mm in width, {{with thick}} {{cartilaginous}} end-plates. By mid-adolescence the adult size is achieved. During adulthood the end-plates decrease in width to a thinner layer. Degeneration of the <b>symphysis</b> pubis accompanies aging and postpartum. Women {{have a greater}} thickness of this pubic disc which allows more mobility of the pelvic bones, hence providing a greater diameter of pelvic cavity during childbirth.|$|E
25|$|In Genasauria, the mandibular <b>symphysis</b> {{is shaped}} like a spout and forms at an acute angle. The mandibular <b>symphysis</b> {{is the point of}} fusion between the two lateral dentary bones. The {{mandible}} of Genasauria is also characterized by the possession of a coronoid process that is longer than 50 percent of the depth of the midlength of the dentary. The coronoid process is a thin anterior projection of bone from the dentary, which serves as a site for the attachment of muscles that aid in chewing behavior.|$|E
25|$|The main {{motions of}} the <b>symphysis</b> pubis are superior/inferior glide and separation/compression. The {{functions}} of the joint are to absorb shock during walking and allow delivery of a baby.|$|E
25|$|UCMP 37877: The {{front part}} of a right dentary {{preserving}} the mandibular <b>symphysis,</b> with six tooth sockets of which five have broken teeth, collected in 1945 in the locality V-4517. This element measures 189.0 millimeters in length, being 68% higher than the rate of Sebecus icaeorhinus specimen. Their teeth are quite compressed and has a first side facing forward tooth, the second is directed upwards and the third also slopes, while others are vertical; the first teeth have a wide separation between them (diastema). <b>Symphysis</b> extending beyond the sixth tooth, while the bone surface is smoother than in S. icaeorhinus.|$|E
25|$|The pelvis is {{the largest}} bony part of the {{skeleton}} and contains three joints: the pubic <b>symphysis,</b> and two sacroiliac joints. A highly durable network of ligaments surrounds these joints giving them tremendous strength.|$|E
25|$|Analysis of {{the pelvis}} shows the skinny regions {{function}} as arches, transferring {{the weight of}} the upright trunk from the sacrum to the hips. The <b>symphysis</b> pubis connects these two weight-bearing arches, and the ligaments that surround this pelvic region maintain the mechanical integrity.|$|E
25|$|Dicraeosaurids are {{characterized}} by their relatively small body size, short necks, and long neural spines. They are 10–13 meters in body length. They share thirteen unambiguous synapomorphies including dorsal vertebrae without pleurocoels, {{the presence of a}} ventrally directed prong on the squamosal, and a subtriangular-shaped dentary <b>symphysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Movement is {{not limited}} to only {{synovial}} joints, although they allow for most freedom. Muscles also run over <b>symphysis,</b> which allow for movement in for example the vertebral column by compression of the intervertebral discs. Additionally, synovial joints can be divided into different types, depending on their axis of movement.|$|E
25|$|The apex (prev.vertex) is {{directed}} forward toward {{the upper part}} of the pubic <b>symphysis,</b> and from there the median umbilical ligament continues upward on the back of the anterior abdominal wall to the umbilicus. The peritoneum is carried by it from the apex on to the abdominal wall to form the middle umbilical fold.|$|E
25|$|Pubic symphyses have {{importance}} {{in the field of}} forensic anthropology, as they can be used to estimate the age of adult skeletons. Throughout life, the surfaces are worn at a fairly predictable rate. By examining the wear of the pubic <b>symphysis,</b> it is possible to estimate the age of the person at death.|$|E
