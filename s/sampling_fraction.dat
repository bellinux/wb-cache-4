Given that respondents generally cannot be interviewed more than once, this assumption is counterfactual. We join recent work by Gile and Handcock in exploring the implications of the sampling-with-replacement assumption for bias of RDS estimators. We differ from previous studies in examining a wider range of <b>sampling</b> <b>fractions</b> and in using not only simulations but also formal proofs. One key finding is that RDS estimates are surprisingly stable even in the presence of substantial <b>sampling</b> <b>fractions.</b> Our analyses show that the sampling-with-replacement assumption is a minor contributor to bias for <b>sampling</b> <b>fractions</b> under 40 %, and bias is negligible for the 20 % or smaller <b>sampling</b> <b>fractions</b> typical of field applications of RDS...|$|R

We show that the <b>sampling</b> <b>fractions</b> obtained by the conventional definition (I) of (average observed energy in layer) /(average deposited energy in layer) will not give the best energy resolution for the calorimeter.

The 'sampling fractions' obtained by this method (II) are shown to give the best resolution for overall energy. We further show that the method (II) <b>sampling</b> <b>fractions</b> are obtained by summing the columns of a non-local {lambda} tensor that incorporates the correlations.

40|$|By {{assuming}} that the underlying distribution belongs to the domain of attraction of an extreme value distribution, one can extrapolate the data to a far tail region so that a rare event can be predicted. However, when the distribution is {{in the domain of}} attraction of a Gumbel distribution, the extrapolation is quite limited generally in comparison with a heavy tailed distribution. In view of this drawback, a Weibull tailed distribution has been studied recently. Some methods for choosing the <b>sample</b> <b>fraction</b> in estimating the Weibull tail coefficient and some bias reduction estimators have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we show that the theoretical optimal <b>sample</b> <b>fraction</b> does not exist and a bias reduction estimator does not always produce a smaller mean squared error than a biased estimator. These are different from using a heavy tailed distribution.

The derivation of the class of kernel goodness-of-fit statistics is based on the close link between the strict Pareto and the exponential distribution, and puts some of the available goodness-of-fit procedures for the latter in a broader perspective. Two important special cases of the kernel statistic, the Jackson and the Lewis statistic, will be discussed in greater depth. The relationship between the limiting distribution of the Lewis statistic and the bias-component of the asymptotic mean squared error of the Hill estimator is exploited to construct a new tail <b>sample</b> <b>fraction</b> selection criterion for the latter.
