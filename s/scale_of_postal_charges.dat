50|$|Saxon postal mileposts {{were set}} up {{during the reign of}} August the Strong and his {{successor}} along all important postal and trading routes and in almost all towns in the Electorate of Saxony to indicate the official distances.

50|$|The film {{utilizes}} three contrasting {{techniques to}} convey its meaning. First, Night Mail portrays the daily activities <b>of</b> the <b>postal</b> staff {{on a human}} scale, with colloquial speech and naturalistic vignettes, like sipping beer and sharing inside jokes. This was the approach favored by Harry Watt, who apprenticed under ethnographic filmmaker Robert Flaherty. Second, Night Mail uses expressionistic techniques like heavy back-lighting and the lyric poetry of Auden to convey the grand <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> the <b>postal</b> endeavor. These techniques were championed by Basil Wright, a lover of experimental European cinema. Finally, the film occasionally employs narration to explain the particular marvels of the mail system. This factual exposition was promoted by John Grierson.|$|R

40|$|Postal {{services}} have emerged and existed {{because of the}} need for communication and their millenary existence was achieved due to three elements: the only channel of communication, the state of monopoly conferred by the status of the state institution and therefore no competition. The most important known moments in the history <b>of</b> <b>postal</b> services, which led to reforms are: unification <b>of</b> postage <b>charges,</b> <b>postal</b> stamp appearance and now, liberalization <b>of</b> <b>postal</b> services. The slow development <b>of</b> the <b>postal</b> sector varies from country to country, depending on the state of development of the country and within countries depending on the gap between urban and rural areas. The operation <b>of</b> <b>postal</b> services throughout their existence was and is provided by specific legislation and it should be aligned with international postal legislation, to ensure continuity of information. There can be no country to formulate its own laws or its own organization, without regard to organization and international regulations. Both the specificity and diversity <b>of</b> <b>postal</b> services causes a special approach {{in the context of their}} market and also in the services market context. Postal services are services of general interest, which emerged from communication need, from personal or official needs, not from economic needs. As an alternative to postal {{services have}} emerged and developed rapidly the courier services that come to complete and even compete to this category of services. We proposed in this paper to analyze and compare these two categories of services to determine the advantages and disadvantages but also the degree of which grow together or develop in a continuous competition...|$|R

40|$|The former Minister Shizuka Kamei, who was {{appointed}} as the Minister for Financial Services during the premiership of Yukio Hatoyama, pushed reforms to change the previous goal of completely privatizing the postal services. The basic policy is that participation {{by the government in}} the businesses <b>of</b> <b>postal</b> savings will be practically maintained and the ceiling <b>of</b> <b>postal</b> savings will be raised from 10, 000, 000 yen to 20, 000, 000 yen.

The results showed that the presence <b>of</b> <b>postal</b> savings in a region does not pressure credit associations to set higher deposit interest rates, at least under the present conditions. It can thus be concluded that if a set of reforms is carried out which maintains the participation of the government in the Japan Post Bank, the ceiling <b>of</b> <b>postal</b> savings should be frozen at the present level. ...|$|R
