5000|$|... #Caption: Multi-wheel <b>swivel</b> <b>caster</b> used {{in heavy}} {{industrial}} applications ...|$|E
50|$|Casters {{comprise}} {{two major}} categories: a <b>swivel</b> <b>caster</b> pivots around a kingpin, so it rotates {{as well as}} rolls, while a rigid caster has its wheel mounted in a fixed frame, or rig, and only rolls.|$|E
50|$|A square scooter or gym scooter is {{a square}} board made from plastic or wood with a <b>swivel</b> <b>caster</b> at each corner. It is {{primarily}} used in American Physical Education classes, particularly elementary or middle school. They came into great popularity across the United States {{in the late}} 1980s and early 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Swivel</b> <b>casters</b> are {{commonly}} used on smaller wagons because of the flexible, [...] mobility they offer. As the number of <b>swivel</b> <b>casters</b> attached to a wagon increases, though, it becomes increasingly difficult to align them. Consequently, {{it may be difficult}} or impossible to move a wagon that has a large number of <b>swivel</b> <b>casters</b> when the casters are unaligned. As a result, rigid casters are preferred for larger wagons, which typically require a proportionally higher number of casters.|$|R
50|$|This {{style of}} caster only allows forward and {{backward}} movement. Rigid casters tend to be stronger than <b>swivel</b> <b>casters.</b> They are rated at the same capacity as the <b>swivel</b> <b>casters</b> for safety reasons. They can be a one piece construction or a two piece construction that is riveted or welded.|$|R
5000|$|This type of caster {{allows for}} {{movement}} in multiple directions. They can {{have one or}} two sets of raceways that allow the <b>caster</b> to <b>swivel</b> 360 degrees under a load. The different types of <b>swivel</b> <b>casters</b> include the following: ...|$|R
5000|$|Swivel head: A rigid caster allows single {{back and}} forth direction. A <b>swivel</b> <b>caster</b> allows for 360 degree {{directional}} movement. The swivel action of a caster depends on bearings and lubrication. Bearing designs include ball bearings and raceway bearings. Grease fittings serve to inject grease into the axles, caster raceways and wheels. Grease fittings may also be known as [...] "zerks." ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development and}} certification of the H 1640 caster tool. This tool is used to rotate <b>swivel</b> <b>caster</b> wheels 90 degrees on bomb hand trucks or shipping containers. The B 83 is a heavy bomb system and weighs close to 5, 600 pounds for a two-high stack configuration. High castering moments (handle length times the force exerted on handle) are required to caster a wheel for a two-high stack of B 83 s. The H 1640 is available to the DoD (Air Force) through the Special Equipment List (SEL) for the B 83 {{as a replacement for}} the H 631 and H 1216 caster tools...|$|E
2500|$|Air casters are {{sometimes}} used {{in place of}} rolling casters. These require pressurized air to operate, which produces audible hiss that is undesirable in some situations, and are typically more expensive than rolling casters, but they {{have the advantage of}} [...] "locking" [...] the scenery securely in place when depressurized and, like <b>swivel</b> <b>casters,</b> they permit omnidirectional movement.|$|R
50|$|BRUTEs were a wheeled platform, {{generally}} with mesh {{around three}} {{sides of the}} body, the fourth side being open with canvas (or later plastic) straps for restraint of the load. The front included a panel for notes to be chalked to help sort traffic. A few BRUTEs had just the front, for carrying bulky loads {{too big for the}} cage, or two hinged ramps (no sides) to load or unload BRUTEs into railway vans. Each BRUTE had two fixed wheels at the rear and two <b>swivelling</b> <b>caster</b> wheels at the front, with polyurethane tyres and taper bearings. Coupling were at front and rear, the front being a pin, the rear a hinged loop on a sprung shaft. A lever on the front operated brakes on the rear wheels and lifted the coupling pin.|$|R
5000|$|The key {{dimensions}} {{to consider when}} determining the proper type of caster and caster size for {{a particular type of}} equipment and application are its overall height, swivel radius, and <b>swivel</b> offset (see <b>Caster</b> Dimensions diagram). The key elements of a caster include the following: ...|$|R
5000|$|Yoke: The {{part of a}} <b>swivel</b> or rigid <b>caster</b> and can be {{considered}} a frame. The caster yoke serves to hold the wheel in place. The yoke, working with a swivel head allows the caster wheel to operate in a 360 degree manner. The yoke is also known as the fork, rig or housing.|$|R
5000|$|Using an English-style Windsor chair, {{possibly}} made by {{and purchased}} from Francis Trumble or Philadelphia cabinet-maker Benjamin Randolph, Thomas Jefferson invented the first swivel chair. [...] Jefferson heavily modified the Windsor chair and incorporated {{top and bottom}} parts connected by a central iron spindle, enabling the top half known as the seat, to <b>swivel</b> on <b>casters</b> of the type used in rope-hung windows. When the Second Continental Congress met in Philadelphia, Jefferson's swivel chair is purported to be the chair he sat upon when he drafted the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776. Jefferson later had the swivel chair sent to his Virginia plantation, Monticello, where he later built a [...] "writing paddle" [...] onto its side in August 1791.|$|R
2500|$|A swivel or {{revolving}} {{chair is}} {{a chair with}} a single central leg that allows the seat to spin around. Swivel chairs can have wheels on the base allowing the user to glide the chair around their work area without getting up. This type of chair is common in modern offices and is often {{also referred to as}} an office chair. Using an English-style Windsor chair which was possibly made and purchased from Francis Trumble or Philadelphia cabinet-maker Benjamin Randolph, Thomas Jefferson invented the swivel chair in 1776.

Since 1836, the chair has been in the possession of the American Philosophical Society located in Philadelphia.|$|R
