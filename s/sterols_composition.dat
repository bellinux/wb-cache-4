The optimal composition of the medium was found to be: 5 % fructose, 1 % hydrolysate of casein, 1 % yeast extract, and 0. 3 % KH 2 PO 4 at pH = 6 and incubation temperature of 20 °C. In this condition the maximum biomass growth was observed, yielding 10. 2 g L− 1 of dry weight after 3 -week of growth.

Identification of the <b>sterol</b> <b>composition</b> of these mutants revealed a high flexibility of the sterol-processing steps instead of the previously proposed sequential conversion. Compared with the wild type, the mutants showed altered resistances to different exogenous stresses regarding the specific growth rate and duration of lag phase. The erg 5 deletion mutant whose sterol has a saturated side chain exhibited overall robust growth under the tested stress conditions. The thermotolerant phenotype of erg 5 deletion mutant was reproduced in filamentous fungus Penicillium oxalicum.

40|$|Contemporary {{society is}} faced with the {{question}} how to ensure suffiecient nutrition (quantity and quality) for rapidly growing population. One solution can be consumption of edible insect, which can have very good nutritional value (dietary energy, protein, fatty acids, fibers, dietary minerals and vitamins composition). Some edible insects species, which contains a relatively large amount of fat, can have a {{potential to be a}} „good" (interesting, new) source of minor lipophilic compounds such as sterols (cholesterol and phytosterols) and tocopherols in our diet. For this reason, the objective of this work was to characterize the sterols and tocopherols composition of fat from larvae of edible insect Zophobas morio L. and Tenebrio mollitor L. Cholesterol and three phytosterols (campesterol, stigmasterol and β-sitosterol) were reliably identified and quantified after hot saponification and derivatization by GC-MS. Other steroid compounds, including 5, 6 -trans-cholecalciferol were identified only according to the NIST library. Cholesterol was the predominant sterol in all analysed samples. Both types of larvae also contained high amount of phytosterols. Different region of origin had a no significant impact on <b>sterols</b> <b>composition,</b> while the effect of beetle genus was crucial. Tocopherols were analysed by reverse phase HPLC coupled with amperometric detection. Tocopherols content in mealworm larvae was lower than content in edible oils, but important from the nutritional point of view.

40|$|Analysis of the <b>sterol</b> <b>compositions</b> of 13 {{clinical}} isolates of the pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans {{obtained from}} five patients with recurring cryptococcal meningitis showed that, unlike Candida albicans, the major sterols synthesized by this yeast were obtusifoliol (range, 21. 1 to 68. 2 %) and ergosterol (range, 0. 0 to 46. 5 %). There was considerable {{variation in the}} sterol contents among the 13 isolates, with total sterol contents ranging from 0. 31 to 5. 9 % of dry weight. The isolates from the five patients who had relapses had different total <b>sterol</b> contents and <b>compositions</b> in comparison {{with those of the}} pretreatment isolates, indicating either that the sterols had been changed by therapy or that the patients were infected with new isolates with different <b>sterol</b> <b>compositions.</b> Growth of the cryptococcal isolates in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of fluconazole (0. 25 x the MIC) significantly altered the sterol content and pattern. The total sterol content decreased in nine isolates and increased in four isolates in response to pretreatment with fluconazole. Fluconazole had no consistent effect on ergosterol levels. In contrast, fluconazole caused a decrease in obtusifoliol levels and an increase in 4, 14 -dimethylzymosterol levels in all isolates. These results indicate extensive diversity in <b>sterol</b> content, <b>sterol</b> <b>composition,</b> and <b>sterol</b> synthesis in response to subinhibitory concentrations of fluconazole in C. neoformans strains. We propose that fluconazole inhibits the sterol synthesis of C. neoformans by interfering with both 14 alpha-demethylase-dependent and -independent pathways.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} lipopeptide {{antifungal}} agent, syringomycin E (SRE) on the membrane permeability of human {{red blood cells}} (RBCs) was studied. SRE added to RBCs above a concentration of 2 × 106 molecules/cell (50 μg/ml RBCs) caused a rapid and concentration dependent lysis of a small subpopulation of RBCs; the extent of this lysis remained unchanged as long as 100 min. During this time period the membranes of the unlysed cells had enhanced permeability for ions which was monitored by direct measurement of 86 Rb flux. Both the extent of cell lysis and ion transport rate showed linear relationships with SRE concentration demonstrating a random distribution of SRE molecules in red blood cells. The kinetics of the 86 Rb efflux suggested pore formation by syringomycin E. The pores had discrete life times and were eventually inactivated. The pores were also a pathway for efflux of monomeric haemoglobin. Alteration of the membrane <b>sterol</b> <b>composition,</b> i. e. depletion of cholesterol by 50 % or partial ergosterol substitution of the cholesterol increased the SRE induced membrane permeability for 86 Rb by two orders compared to membranes with unaltered <b>sterol</b> <b>composition.</b> This modification of the <b>sterol</b> <b>composition</b> promotes the pore forming activity of this lipopeptide in the membrane...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the <b>sterol</b> <b>composition</b> and metabolism of promyelocytic leukaemia cell lines (HL- 60) after treatment with 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13 -acetate (TPA). A variant cell line (Blast II cells) which is resistant to TPA was used as control. Analysis of the sterols of TPA-sensitive cells radiolabelled with [3 H]leucine, [14 C]acetate or [14 C]pyruvate showed a high incorporation into cholesterol and a low incorporation in lanosterol + dihydrolanosterol. The inverse relationship was observed in TPA-resistant cells. Experiments with other cellular variants representing TPA-sensitive and TPA-resistant classes gave similar results. Analysis of the cellular <b>sterol</b> <b>composition</b> by gas chromatography confirmed that TPA-resistant cells are particularly rich in lanosterol/dihydrolanosterol. TPA treatment enhanced the incorporation of [14 C]pyruvate into the sterol fraction of both cell types. This was accompanied by an alteration of incorporation into several lipids, particularly phospholipids. Pulse-chase studies with [14 C]acetate revealed that TPA induced the release of radioactive lipids into the medium from HL- 60 and Blast II cells. However this treatment released phospholipids from the TPA-sensitive cells and sterols and fatty acids from the TPA-resistant cells. We conclude that the <b>sterol</b> <b>composition</b> can regulate specific biochemical processes in the membrane and {{can be considered as}} a factor that plays a role in the responsiveness of HL- 60 cells to TPA...|$|R

40|$|Sterols are {{important}} structural components of eukaryotic cell membranes, where they influence membrane fluidity and permeability. Sterols contain a four-ring structure with a hydrocarbon side-chain. The <b>sterol</b> <b>composition</b> and structure differs among plants, mammals and fungi. Mammals and fungi contain a single main sterol such as cholesterol or ergosterol, respectively. In contrast, plants contain {{a mixture of}} several sterols with varying side-chain length such as sitosterol, stigmasterol and 24 -methyl cholesterol. Side-chain length is regulated by the two enzymes, Sterol methyl transferase type- 1 (SMT 1) and type- 2 (SMT 2) which increase side-chain length by a methyl (SMT 1) or ethyl (SMT 2) group. Thus, regulation of SMT enzyme activity is crucial for <b>sterol</b> <b>composition</b> in plants. This project considers to what extent oxysterols, oxidized sterol forms, can regulate SMT 1 activity. SMT 1 activity was assayed in microsome preparations from three plant species, and different oxysterols {{were added to the}} enzyme reaction to investigate the effect on enzyme activity. Results showed that oxysterols inhibited SMT 1 activity in all plant species tested. The inhibitory effect was stronger for side-chain oxysterols (24 -OH and 25 -OH cholesterol) than for ring hydroxylated ones (7 β-OH cholesterol). The results suggest that oxysterols have an inhibitory effect on SMT 1 activity in plants, and may be part of a feed-back regulation of <b>sterol</b> <b>composition...</b>|$|R

Substitution of approximately 50 % of cholesterol by epicholesterol results in an early and significant increase in the Kir current density. Furthermore, substitution of cholesterol by epicholesterol has a stronger facilitative effect on the current than cholesterol depletion. Neither single channel properties nor membrane capacitance were significantly affected by the changes in the membrane <b>sterol</b> <b>composition.</b> These results suggest that 1) cholesterol modulates cellular K(+) conductance by changing the number of the active channels and 2) that specific cholesterol-protein interactions are critical for the regulation of endothelial Kir...|$|R
40|$|In vitro {{manipulation}} of membrane sterol level affects {{the regulation of}} ion channels and consequently certain cellular functions; however, a comprehensive study that confirms the pathophysiological significance of these results is missing. The malfunction of 7 -dehydrocholesterol (7 DHC) reductase in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) leads to the elevation of the 7 -dehydrocholesterol level in the plasma membrane. T lymphocytes were isolated from SLOS patients to assess {{the effect of the}} in vivo altered membrane <b>sterol</b> <b>composition</b> on the operation of the voltage-gated Kv 1. 3 channel and the ion channel-dependent mitogenic responses. We found that the kinetic and equilibrium parameters of Kv 1. 3 activation changed in SLOS cells. Identical changes in Kv 1. 3 operation were observed when control/healthy T cells were loaded with 7 DHC. Removal of the putative sterol binding sites on Kv 1. 3 resulted in a phenotype that was not influenced by the elevation in membrane sterol level. Functional assays exhibited impaired activation and proliferation rate of T cells probably partially due to the modified Kv 1. 3 operation. We concluded that the altered membrane <b>sterol</b> <b>composition</b> hindered the operation of Kv 1. 3 as well as the ion channel-controlled T cell functions. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
