Where shocks occur to how courts intrepet language in existing boilerplate bond contracts, leading to material and idiosyncratic changes in the underlying allocation of substantive rights for the different issuers, we find no disclosure of such changes to investors. Conversely, we find that where there is less of a legal requirement for disclosure, such as when the entire market shifts publicly to using explicit collective action clauses in the bond contracts, there is a high level of disclosure. Over time, long after such terms have become the market standard and thus part of the total mix of information, this heightened level of disclosure continues. In sum, we find heightened disclosure in the place where legal obligations (and investor needs) for disclosure are less significant and no disclosure in the place where legal obligations (and investor needs) for disclosure are more significant...|$|R

As a consequence, when a much larger flight to liquidity occurred than they had anticipated when constructing their portfolio, their positions designed to profit from convergence to fair value incurred large losses as expensive but liquid securities became more expensive, and cheap but illiquid securities became cheaper.

5000|$|Chartalists {{argue that}} deficit {{spending}} is logically necessary because, in their view, fiat money {{is created by}} deficit spending: fiat money cannot be collected in taxes before it is issued and spent; the amount of fiat money in circulation is exactly the government debt—money spent but not collected in taxes.

They cannot go bankrupt involuntarily because this fiat money is what is used in their economy to settle debts, while household liabilities are not so used.

40|$|Purpose – The {{debate over}} the {{possible}} extension of transparency regulation in Europe to include sovereign bonds has opened up {{a number of other}} issues in need of serious consideration. One such issue is the appropriateness of the entire infrastructure supporting the trading of European sovereign bonds. In recent years, <b>sovereign</b> <b>issuers</b> have supported the development of an electronic inter-dealer market but have remained unconcerned with the opacity of dealer-to-customer trading. The degree of segmentation in this market is high relative to what exists in nearly all other financial markets. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to outline the transparency proposals for European sovereign bond markets. Design/methodology/approach – This paper explores why European sovereign bond markets have developed in such a segmented way and considers how this structure could be altered to improve transparency without adversely affecting liquidity, efficiency or the benefits enjoyed by primary dealers and issuers. Findings – It is suggested that the structure of the market could be improved greatly if the largest and most active investors were permitted access to the inter-dealer electronic trading platforms. This would solve a number of market imperfections and increase the proportion of market activity that is conducted in a transparent way. Originality/value – The paper argues that <b>sovereign</b> <b>issuers</b> in Europe have the means to provide incentives that would influence dealers to support reduced segmentation. Some practical examples of how this could be achieved are provided and the potential benefits are outlined. Bonds, Europe, Financial markets...|$|R

40|$|The {{external}} debt of emerging market sovereign borrowers is now {{mainly in the}} form of bonds held by numerous institutional and individual bondholders. Many of these bonds are governed by the law of the state of New York. As a matter of drafting convention, bonds for sovereign issuers governed by New York law prohibit amendments to the payment terms of the instruments (the amount and the due dates of payments) without the consent of each affected bondholder. If a <b>sovereign</b> <b>issuer</b> finds it necessary to seek a restructuring of its bond indebtedness, it must therefore implement the restructuring by offering to exchange its old bonds for new debt instruments that reflect the new financial terms; a technique that inevitably risks leaving behind 2 ̆ 2 holdout 2 ̆ 2 creditors who may refuse to accept the proposed restructuring. Holdouts pose a litigation threat to the sovereign and may even jeopardize the sovereign 2 ̆ 7 s ability to service the new bonds it has issued to the other creditors participating in the exchange. A number of ideas - ranging from international bankruptcy codes and stays of creditor legal remedies administered by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to reforming the explicit terms of sovereign bond contracts - have been suggested as a means of dealing with the holdout creditor threat. This article suggests a less radical, and more immediately applicable, alternative; allowing the majority creditors to use the amendment clauses in their existing bonds to change certain nonpayment terms contained in those bonds (such as financial covenants or waivers of sovereign immunity) as a means of encouraging prospective holdouts to participate in the exchange. Because the <b>sovereign</b> <b>issuer</b> solicits the consent of its creditors to amend the old bonds just as those lenders exchange their bonds for the sovereign 2 ̆ 7 s new debt instruments, this techinque is referred to as an 2 ̆ 2 exit 2 ̆ 2 consent...|$|E
40|$|Sovereign {{bonds are}} usually priced under the {{assumption}} that only the <b>sovereign</b> <b>issuer</b> may be responsible of their repayment. In some cases however, bondholders may legitimately expect to be repaid by more than one agent. For example, when a country breaks-up, successor states may agree to recognize their responsibility for part of the debt. Other extreme events, such as repudiations, may lead (and have led) bondholders to consider several bailout candidates at the same point in time. This paper first discusses the theoretical financial implications stemming from an infrequent and challenging situation, namely the existence of multiple potential payers. Then, through a historical precedent, the 1918 Russian repudiation, the paper confirms that the existence of multiple potential payers has a diversification effect which lowers the volatility of the bond price and increases its value. These results are strengthened by a comparison with a closely related standard case of default. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

Since the late 1990 s, credit spreads on Latin American issues have declined broadly inline with those in other emerging markets. Recent empirical analysis has explained this phenomenon by identifying critical macroeconomic factors, including the reduction in systematic risk in individual markets, although the structural models from the theoretical finance literature also predict the importance of key default and interest rate variables. This contribution adds to the understanding of these issues by investigating the application of structural models to the Latin American setting, one historically characterized by excessive volatility and susceptibility to episodes of default. credit spreads, long-run dynamics, Latin America, sovereign bonds, cointegration...|$|R

40|$|Selective default is {{an event}} in which a <b>sovereign</b> <b>issuer</b> chooses not to meet {{obligations}} on a class of bonds, while servicing her other debt.

Using three measures of liquidity, including the bid-ask spread and liquidity based estimates from a model extension of the limited dependent variable model (Lesmond, Ogden, and Trzincka (1999)), and a unique data set of emerging market bonds spanning 16 countries and eight years, we demonstrate the importance of modeling liquidity as a component of yield spreads.

The financial crisis has as consequence the rapid increase of spreads in some countries and as result it created Euro zone of two speeds.

40|$|The {{admission}} by the Greek {{government on}} October 18, 2009, of large-scale accounting fraud in its national accounts sparked an unprecedented sovereign debt crisis that rapidly {{spread to the}} Eurozone’s weakest member states. As the crisis increasingly drove a wedge between a seemingly resilient Eurozone core and its faltering periphery, its first collateral victims were the private banks of the hardest-hit sovereigns. They were rapidly followed {{by the rest of}} the Eurozone’s banks as a result of their large exposure to not only their home country’s sovereign debt, but also to the debt securities of other member states. Measuring each bank’s precise exposure to every <b>sovereign</b> <b>issuer</b> became a key issue for credit analysis in the attempt to assess the potential impact of a selective sovereign default if worse came to worst. Yet finding that information in a timely manner is hardly an easy task, as banks are not required to disclose it. Building on the efficient market hypothesis in the presence of informed traders, we tested the sensitivity of each of the largest Eurozone private banks’ CDSs to sovereign CDSs using a simple autoregressive model estimated by time-series regressions and panel regressions, comparing the results to news releases to assess its reliability. Eventually, we used the Oaxaca Blinder decomposition to measure whether the unconventional monetary policies, namely the LTRO and the OMT, that the ECB has implemented to stem the crisis have helped banks directly or whether banks were actually helped by the reduction in sovereign CDS spreads. ...|$|E
40|$|Both {{academia and}} {{practitioners}} long shared {{the belief that}} default {{on the part of}} a sovereign entity was an extremely rare event. A similarly strong opinion was also that countries could not go bankrupt and, therefore, government bonds could be considered a good proxy of risk-free rates, notwithstanding the more or less recent cases of default and debt restructuring that have occurred in emerging countries. Consequently, sovereign risk assessment models were mainly oriented towards the analysis of interest rate or liquidity risk, rather than default risk. Within the approaches used to measure the possible default of a <b>sovereign</b> <b>issuer,</b> a fundamental role is played by rating agencies, which issue “Sovereign Credit Ratings” consisting of an assessment of a State’s future capability and willingness to fulfil its obligations towards its creditors. Both academics and practitioners agree that country risk is multidimensional, and the traditional measures and sovereign ratings from specialised agencies are unable to capture the specific risks of the different countries. This is especially true after the international financial crisis, which has triggered a negative spiral between sovereign risk and the credit risk of banking intermediaries, exhibiting the different transmission channels through which sovereign risk affects bank funding. Rises in sovereign risk adversely affect banks’ funding costs through several channels, due to the pervasive role of government debt in the financial system. Three major international agencies – Moody’s Investor Service, Fitch Investor Service and Standard & Poor’s – consider and assess these event risks differently in order to determine their sovereign credit rating. Starting from summer 2011, tensions in sovereign credit rating were quickly transmitted to the banking systems. In fact, sovereign downgrades have direct negative repercussions on the cost of banks’ debt and equity funding, because this is a channel through which sovereign risk adversely affects banks’ funding costs. In particular, sovereign ratings generally represent a ceiling for the ratings of domestic banks. This complex of factors has brought into the limelight, within the financial system, the so-called country risk, and has shown that the determinants of this risk have become more complex (sovereign debt structure and composition, the EMU countries sharing the euro currency and monetary policy, the ratings from the ECAIs – the External Credit Agency Institutions, etc.), intensified, and strongly interrelated as a consequence of the international financial crisis. From this perspective, the present study aims at: A. 	Outlining a frame for the definition of country risk and its determinants; B.

Such a form of competition has great benefits if it leads to a convergence of national legal and regulatory environments toward the ‘best practice’ and the highest standards.
