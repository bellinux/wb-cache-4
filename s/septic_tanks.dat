40|$|Abstract 117 The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the removal of suspended solids (SS) and 7 -day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 7) in a three chamber <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> depending on theoretical wastewater retention time {{and the degree of}} <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> cleanliness. It was found out that the performance of the <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> depended on the degree of its cleanliness: when the <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> was clean and retention time was three days, SS and BOS 7 removal efficiency was 77 ± 10 % and 67 ± 14 % respectively, whereas two months later, after <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> desludging, SS removal efficiency decreased to 53 ± 22 % and BOD 7 to 32 ± 31 %. The performance of the <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> also depended on theoretical wastewater retention time: when some amount of solids was accumulated {{at the bottom of the}} <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> and wastewater retention time was one day, SS and BOS 7 removal efficiency was 45 ± 40 % and 33 ± 16 % respectively; when retention time was three days, SS removal efficiency increased to 53 ± 22 % but BOD 7 removal efficiency remained similar to one day retention time, i. e. 32 ± 31 %.

Eight onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) were evaluated for suitability of application in Nigeria for efficient treatment and disposal of domestic wastewater, using analytic network process (ANP). Ten location re-lated risks were used as criteria in the decision making process. Expert views were used to obtain pairwise com-parison matrices of the OWTSs with respect to the criteria. Saaty’s Super Decision Software was used to com-plete the ranking process. The order of ranking obtained was as follows: <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> with absorption field (0. 1502) > <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> with soakaway (0. 142) > composting toilet (0. 128) > <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> with sand filter (0. 125) > <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> with constructed wetland (0. 12) > <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> with holding tank (0. 12) > <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> with mound sys-tem (0. 118) > <b>septic</b> <b>tank</b> with recirculating sand filter (0. 096).
