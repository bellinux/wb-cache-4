30|$|Folate {{deficiency}} {{increases the}} risk of anaemia, neural tube defects, cancer, vascular disease and neurological disorders (Bailey 1995, 2009). In addition to dietary inadequacy, a <b>functional</b> folate <b>deficiency</b> can be caused by anything that interferes with the bioavailability of the folate, including any defect in the hydrolysis, absorption, transport or cellular utilization (McNulty and Pentieva 2009; Gregory 1995). Folate antagonists include alcohol, and medicines used for the treatment of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and other disorders (McNulty and Pentieva 2009; Gregory 1995). Gastro-intestinal disease or mutations in genes for folate transport or metabolism also affect folate bioavailability (McNulty and Pentieva 2009). A deficiency of vitamin B 12 can cause a <b>secondary,</b> <b>functional,</b> folate <b>deficiency</b> by means of the methylfolate trap (Tisman and Herbert 1973; Smulders et al. 2006; Scott and Weir 1981).|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} study, a patient suffering from linear frontoparietal scleroderma {{and some of}} his family members were found to have an incomplete <b>functional</b> <b>deficiency</b> of the second component (C 2) of complement (C). In this study, the proband {{and the rest of his}} family members were investigated for <b>functional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> of C 2 and the fourth component of C (C 4). A search for null alleles of C 2 (C 2 *Q 0) and C 4 (C 4 *Q 0) was made to find out whether their occurrence is responsible for incomplete <b>functional</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> HLA analysis was performed to find out whether deficiencies are linked to HLA alleles known to be associated with C 4 *Q 0 and C 2 *Q 0. Possible large deletions at C 4 and 21 -hydroxylase (21 -OH) gene loci were also investigated in some family members. The proband had a combined <b>functional</b> <b>deficiency</b> of C 4 and C 2. Some of his family members had a partial <b>functional</b> <b>deficiency</b> of C 4, some of C 2 and some of C 4 and C 2; none had null alleles of C 2 (C 2 *Q 0), factor B (B*Q 0) or C 4 B (C 4 B*Q 0). C 4 *Q 0 or <b>functional</b> C 4 <b>deficiency</b> in this family was not associated with HLA-A 1;B 8;DR 3 alleles. C 2 deficiency was also not associated with HLA antigens known to be associated with type I and II C 2 deficiencies. No gene deletion or unusual polymorphism at C 4 A and 21 -OHA loci could be seen by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) studies. Combined and isolated partial <b>functional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> of C 4 and C 2 observed in the proband and many of his family members were not caused by C activation or null alleles.

40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: ADAMTS 13 (a disintegrin and {{metalloprotease}} with thrombospondin type 1 repeats, member 13) deficiency {{has been}} reported in patients with sepsis but its clinical relevance and pathophysiology remain unclear. Our objectives were to assess the clinical significance, prognostic value and pathophysiology of ADAMTS 13 deficiency in patients with septic shock with and without disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). METHODS: This was a prospective monocenter cohort study of patients with septic shock. Von Willebrand Factor, ADAMTS 13 -related parameters and plasma IL- 6 concentration were measured at inclusion to the study. Patients were categorized into three groups according to the presence of ADAMT 13 deficiency (< 30 %) or DIC. RESULTS: This study included 72 patients with a median age of 59 years (interquartile range (IQR) 50 to 71). Each of the included patients received vasopressors; 55 (76 %) were under mechanical ventilation and 22 (33 %) underwent renal replacement therapy. Overall, 19 patients (26 %) had DIC, and 36 patients had ADMTS 13 deficiency (50 %). Patients with DIC, ADAMTS 13 deficiency or both were more severe at ICU admission. Mortality was higher in septic shock patients from group one. By multivariate analysis, Simplified Acute Physiology Score 2 (SAPS 2) score (odds ratio (OR) 1. 11 /point; 95 % CI 1. 01 to 1. 24) and ADAMTS 13 activity < 30 % (OR 11. 86; 95 % CI 1. 36 to 103. 52) were independently associated with hospital mortality. There was no correlation between ADAMTS 13 activity and the International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) score (rs = - 0. 97, P = 0. 41) suggesting that ADAMTS 13 <b>functional</b> <b>deficiency</b> and DIC were independent parameters. IL- 6 level was higher in patients with ADAMTS 13 activity < 30 % [895 (IQR 330 to 1843) pg/mL versus 83 (IQR 43 to 118), P = 0. 0003). CONCLUSIONS: Septic shock was associated with a <b>functional</b> <b>deficiency</b> of ADAMTS 13, independently of DIC. ADAMTS 13 <b>functional</b> <b>deficiency</b> is then a prognostic factor for mortality in septic shock patients, independently of DIC...|$|R

40|$|Two {{siblings}} with m ild hemorrhagic symptoms had combined <b>functional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> {{of vitamin}} K-dependent clotting factors. Prothrombin (0. 18 - 0. 20 U/ml) and Stuart factor (Factor X, 0. 18 - 0. 20 U/ml) and Stuart factor (Factor X, 0. 18 - 0. 20 U/ml) were most severely affected. Antigenic amounts of affected coagulation factors were normal and normal generation of thrombin activity {{occurred in the}} patients' plasmas after treatment with nonophysiologic activators {{that do not require}} calcium for prothrombin activation. Hepatobilary disease, malabsorptive disorders, and plasma warfarin were not present. Both parents had normal levels of all coagulation factors. The patients' plasmas contained prothrombin that reacted both with antibody directed against des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin and native prothrombin. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis of patients' plasmas and studies of partially purified patient prothrombin suggested the presence of a relatively homogeneous species of dysfunctional prothrombin, distinct from the heterologous species found in the plasma of warfarin-treated persons. These studies are most consistent with a posttranslational defect in hepatic carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent factors. This kindred uniquely possesses an autosomal recessive disorder of vitamin K-dependent factor formation that causes production of an apparently homogeneous species of dysfunctional prothrombin; the <b>functional</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in clotting factors are totally corrected by oral or parenteral administration of vitamin K 1...|$|R

In vitro, M. africanum isolates bound recombinant human MBL more efficiently than did isolates of M. tuberculosis.

A <b>functional</b> <b>deficiency</b> of vitamin B 12 /folate may be present despite serum levels within reference limits. The amino acid homocysteine (Hcy) is a sensitive but non-specific marker of deficiency of vitamin B 12 and folate and appears to have the strongest association with cognitive function. The association between Hcy levels and cognitive function is also stronger than that of the levels of vitamin B 12 /folate. The clinical manifestations of vitamin B 12 /folate deficiency are non-specific, but when they are connected with laboratory findings adequate investigation should be performed. A generous attitude to treatment with vitamin B 12 /folate is advocated, combined with a compulsory evaluation of treatment effect.
