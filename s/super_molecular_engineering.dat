40|$|<b>Molecular</b> <b>engineering</b> is {{concerned}} with the design and manufacturing of novel chemical compounds and materials. <b>Molecular</b> <b>engineering</b> for drug development is complex, time-consuming, and expensive. To lower costs and improve the overall drug development process, information technology (IT) is increasingly employed in the <b>molecular</b> <b>engineering</b> phase. Key IT components for <b>molecular</b> <b>engineering</b> include public and proprietary databases containing information on molecular structures and properties and computational models capable of calculating global properties of molecular structures based on structural and other descriptors characterizing the compound. Recently data mining and data warehousing have become critical tools in the <b>molecular</b> <b>engineering</b> process. Increasingly, some of the computational resources-such as data and information bases, computational models, compute power to execute these models, specialized data mining algorithms-required to develop a new compound are not available locally, but accessible via the global computing network infrastructure. This paper describes a Grid-based approach to <b>molecular</b> <b>engineering.</b> Focus of this paper is placed on the data warehousing of the OpenMolGRID system. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

There is also considerable overlap with nanotechnology, in that both {{are concerned with}} the behavior of materials on the scale of nanometers or smaller. Given the highly fundamental nature of molecular interactions, there are a plethora of potential application areas, limited perhaps only by one’s imagination and the laws of physics. However, some of the early successes of <b>molecular</b> <b>engineering</b> have come in the fields of immunotherapy, synthetic biology, and printable electronics (see <b>molecular</b> <b>engineering</b> applications).|$|R
