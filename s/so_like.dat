5|$|Decay {{is set in}} {{the same}} {{location}} and timeframe as Half-Life. Half-Life takes place at a laboratory called the Black Mesa Research Facility, situated in a remote desert in New Mexico. In Half-Life, the player takes on the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist involved in an accident that opens an inter-dimensional portal to the borderworld of Xen, allowing the alien creatures of Xen to attack the facility. The player guides Freeman in an attempt to escape the facility and close the portal, ultimately traveling to Xen to do <b>so.</b> <b>Like</b> the previous expansions, Decay shows the story of Half-Life {{from the perspective of a}} different set of protagonists. In Decay, players assume the roles of Colette Green and Gina Cross, two doctors who work in the same labs as Freeman, analyzing anomalous materials and specimens retrieved from Xen in prior teleportation experiments. After the experiment that causes the alien invasion takes place, Green and Cross must work with two ranking members of the science team, Dr. Richard Keller and Dr. Rosenberg, to contain and stabilize the deteriorating situation in Black Mesa.|$|E
5|$|The {{city itself}} is hilly, though not uniformly <b>so.</b> <b>Like</b> Rome, {{the city is}} said to lie on seven hills; the lists vary but {{typically}} include Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the former Denny Hill. The Wallingford, Delridge, Mount Baker, Seward Park, Washington Park, Broadmoor, Madrona, Phinney Ridge, Sunset Hill, Blue Ridge, Broadview, Laurelhurst, Hawthorne Hills, Maple Leaf, and Crown Hill neighborhoods are all located on hills as well. Many of the hilliest areas are near the city center, with Capitol Hill, First Hill, and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between Elliott Bay and Lake Washington. The break in the ridge between First Hill and Beacon Hill is man-made, the result {{of two of the}} many regrading projects that reshaped the topography of the city center. The topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island (completed 1909) {{at the mouth of the}} city's industrial Duwamish Waterway, the terminus of the Green River. The highest point within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle, which is roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St. Other notable hills include Crown Hill, View Ridge/Wedgwood/Bryant, Maple Leaf, Phinney Ridge, Mt. Baker Ridge, and Highlands/Carkeek/Bitterlake.|$|E

Therefore, a full repetition of the Revised Julian leap cycle {{with respect to the}} seven-day weekly cycle is seven times the cycle length = 7 × 900 = 6300 years.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that Eakins first saw Cook perform at the Art Students League of Philadelphia on February 22, 1889, and was inspired to paint The Concert Singer after seeing a photograph of Jules Massenet at an organ, with his wife open-mouthed, singing. Though anonymous female (and angel) singers were often shown with their mouths open in medieval and Renaissance art—as well as in later works such as Degas's Singer with a Glove, 1878—named singing artists were nearly always painted and photographed with their mouths closed at this period. <b>So,</b> <b>like</b> many Eakins portraits, The Concert Singer had an element of daring in its composition, although the mouth is not shown fully open.|$|E
25|$|The {{general rule}} {{that in every}} country {{designers}} use much the same means whereby a pattern is obtained holds good in China. There are forms of band decoration here which closely resemble those of Gothic Europe, and a chair from Turkestan (3rd century) might almost be Elizabethan, <b>so</b> <b>like</b> are the details. Screens of grill form, often found in the historically Islamic countries, are common, and the deeply grounded, closely arranged patterns of Bombay also have their counterparts. The imperial dais in the Chien-Ching Hall, Pekin, is a masterpiece of intricate design. The back consists of one central panel of considerable height, with two of lesser degree on either side luxuriously carved. The whole is crowned with a very heavy crest of dragons and scroll work; the throne also is a wonderful example of carved treatment, and the doors of a cabinet {{in the same building}} show how rich an effect of foliage can be produced without the employment of stalk or scroll. One might almost say, he wastes his talent on such an ungrateful material as wood. In this material fans and other trifles are carved with a delicacy that courts disaster.|$|E

Bromley-Davenport had played {{regularly}} for Middlesex in 1896 and also against South Africa in 1895-96 but the other 3 had not played first-class cricket between the two tours. Whatman and Wickham had not played first-class cricket before the tour while Heseltine had played first-class cricket in 1895 but not in 1896. The remaining 5 had played first class cricket in 1896 and <b>so,</b> <b>like</b> Priestley's tourists, the team was somewhat stronger than Lucas's two years earlier. In 1896 Lord Hawke had played for Yorkshire, Bardswell for Oxford University and Lancashire, Leatham a single match for M.C.C., Leveson-Gower for Oxford University and a single match for Surrey and Warner for Oxford University and 4 matches for Middlesex. Lord Hawke and Heseltine had also played against South Africa in 1895-96. All the 12 played at least three first-class matches on the tour. O. Weber played in the last match of the tour against British Guiana. He had previously played for All West Indies against A.A. Priestley's XI. Mr. St. G.M. de Roebuck and Capt. Hon. M. Bourke played in a minor match.|$|E
25|$|The BM-354P High Velocity Armor Piercing (HVAP) round has {{a maximum}} {{effective}} range of 650 meters by day and 600 meters at night. Its maximum aimed range is 1,060 meters.

It can penetrate 280mm of armour at 1,000 meters. The OF-350 Frag-HE round has a maximum effective range of 600 meters at night and a maximum range of 4,000 meters. The gun can be fired while the vehicle is afloat. The gun can also be depressed and elevated between −4 and +30 degrees <b>so</b> <b>like</b> most Soviet tanks, the PT-76 has a limited ability to depress its main gun, and therefore can have difficulty finding a hull down fire position on higher ground. One of the greatest disadvantages of the gun used on the PT-76 Model 1 was that it had no stabilization system and therefore couldn't be effectively fired while the vehicle was on the move. The PT-76 Model 2 has a 1-axis stabilization system and the PT-76B has a 2-axis system.|$|E

500|$|The {{criticism}} {{most often}} made of Stanford's music by writers from Shaw onwards {{is that his}} music lacks passion. Shaw praised [...] "Stanford the Celt" [...] and abominated [...] "Stanford the Professor", who reined in the emotions of the Celt. In Stanford's church music, the critic Nicholas Temperley finds [...] "a thoroughly satisfying artistic experience, but one that is perhaps lacking in deeply felt religious impulse." [...] In his operas and elsewhere, Grove, Parry and later commentators found music that ought to convey love and romance failing to do <b>so.</b> <b>Like</b> Parry, Stanford strove for seriousness, and his competitive streak led him to emulate Sullivan not in comic opera, for which Stanford had a real gift, but in oratorio in what Rodmell calls grand statements that [...] "only occasionally matched worthiness with power or profundity." ...|$|E

The main focus of their enthusiasm lay in the regularity of elections and in the alternation of parties in power. The government scrupulously observed the Constitution, individual rights seemed protected, and no military leader or other dictator overthrew the elected government."

Arriving in Sydney from Melbourne, L'Estrange erected a large canvas {{enclosure}} in The Domain {{and began a}} regular series of performances on the tightrope, copying the location and stunts of the real Blondin who had performed there in August 1874. His opening night on 26 January 1877 attracted a reported crowd of between two and three thousand people. Newspaper reports commented that his performance was <b>so</b> <b>like</b> that of the original Blondin that people could be forgiven for thinking they had seen the world-renowned rope-walker. With his rope suspended 40 feet (12 metres) above the ground, L'Estrange walked backwards and forwards, walked in armour, walked covered in a sack, used and sat on a chair, cooked and rode a bicycle, all on the rope. His show also included a fireworks display for the public's entertainment.|$|E

In company with Flight Sergeant Les Trist, they took off from Point Cook on 26 September 1926 and made a [...] round trip to the Solomon Islands in a De Havilland DH.50A floatplane. The DH.50's fuselage bore the words [...] "Royal Australian Air Force", the first aircraft to do <b>so.</b> <b>Like</b> the circumnavigation of Australia in 1924, this flight was not without its difficulties. Approaching Southport, Queensland, on 29 September, the DH.50 lost power and had to land in the ocean; after making repairs, McIntyre was twice thrown clear of the aircraft while taxiing to the beach in heavy surf. The expedition returned on 7 December to a 12-plane RAAF escort and a 300-man honour guard.|$|E

500|$|A {{week after}} the match against Surrey, the only Test match of the Australian's tour was played, also at the Oval. In his {{obituary}} in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, {{it was suggested that}} {{were it not for the}} accusations of throwing against Crossland, he would have been selected for the match. Cricket agreed, submitting that due to Fred Morley's absence from the England team due to injury, Crossland was the obvious choice to replace him, as he was the best fast bowler in the country. Despite this, they said that his non-selection showed that his action was not deemed fair by the selection panel. The Morning Post went a step further, and claimed that as Crossland had demonstrated he was England's best fast bowler, he should be selected to play in the Test match if his action was deemed fair, but that if it was not considered fair, he should not be allowed to continue to play for Lancashire either. An article written for The Argus, an Australian daily newspaper, by an unnamed member of the Australian side in 1882 reported that Crossland bowled; [...] "with a delivery <b>so</b> <b>like</b> a throw that I feel sure it would not be allowed in Australia; but, as we all know, throwing in England is just as common as bowling – more's the pity", and it was speculated that the Australian team would have protested had Crossland been chosen for the Test match.|$|E

[...] Barrington {{went on to say}} that producer Richard D'Oyly Carte later came to see him, saying, [...] "...what's the matter? ...some one has just come out of the stalls to tell me you are singing in tune. [...] It will never do." [...] Barrington said that [...] "This pleased me so much that I have never sung flat since, except, of course, when I wished...." [...] Several contemporaries did find Barrington's singing occasionally flat, including Francois Cellier. Many years later, in her memoir, Ellaline Terriss wrote: [...] "...dear old Rutland scarcely ever did sing in tune – but how grand he was.... He had a beautifully clear diction and a marvellous sense of timing – and was one of the finest singers of the then popular topical songs that our stage ever knew." [...] Percy Hetherington Fitzgerald wrote of Barrington in his 1899 book, The Savoy Opera, [...] "His peculiar tranquil or impassive style has always exactly suited the characters allotted to him, and it would now be difficult to imagine a Savoy opera without him. However, Barrington's performance as Dr Daly impressed the critics and audiences, and he won a permanent place in D'Oyly Carte's company.|$|E

In the 1607 edition of Britannia, chorographic surveyor William Camden records that [...] "as for Ely it selfe, it is no small Citie, or greatly to be counted off either for beauty or frequency and resort, as having an unwholsome aire by reason of the fens round about". In 1698, Celia Fiennes was writing [...] "the Bishop [...] does not Care to stay long in this place not being for his health… they have lost their Charter… and its a shame [...] does not see it better ordered and ye buildings and streetes put in a better Condition. They are a slothful people and for little but ye takeing Care of their Grounds and Cattle wch is of vast advantage". Daniel Defoe, when writing in the Eastern Counties section of A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain (1722), went [...] "to Ely, whose cathedral, standing in a level flat country, is seen far and wide… that some of it is so antient, totters so much with every gust of wind, looks <b>so</b> <b>like</b> a decay, and seems so near it, that when ever it does fall, all that 'tis likely will be thought strange in it, will be, that it did not fall a hundred years sooner". On his way to a Midlands tour, John Byng visited Ely on 5July 1790 staying at the Lamb Inn. In his diary he writes that [...] "the town [...] is mean, to the extreme… those withdrawn, their dependancies must decay". Recording in his Rural Rides on 25March 1830, William Cobbett reports that [...] "Ely is what one may call a miserable little town: very prettily situated, but poor and mean.
