5|$|The {{controversial}} {{question of}} whether to add additional slave states to the United States coincided with the growing stature of the Declaration. The first major public debate about slavery and the Declaration {{took place during the}} Missouri controversy of 1819 to 1821. Antislavery Congressmen argued that the language of the Declaration indicated that the Founding Fathers of the United States had been opposed to slavery in principle, and so new slave <b>states</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be added to the country. Proslavery Congressmen led by Senator Nathaniel Macon of North Carolina argued that the Declaration was {{not a part of the}} Constitution and therefore had no relevance to the question.|$|E
5|$|Outside of the Western hemisphere, Hayes's biggest {{foreign policy}} concern dealt with China. In 1868, the Senate had {{ratified}} the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese immigrants into the country. As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen's wages. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, anti-Chinese riots {{broke out in}} San Francisco, and a third party, the Workingman's Party, was formed {{with an emphasis on}} stopping Chinese immigration. In response, Congress passed a Chinese Exclusion Act in 1879, abrogating the 1868 treaty. Hayes vetoed the bill, believing that the United <b>States</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> abrogate treaties without negotiation. The veto drew praise among eastern liberals, but Hayes was bitterly denounced in the West. In the subsequent furor, Democrats in the House of Representatives attempted to impeach him, but narrowly failed when Republicans prevented a quorum by refusing to vote. After the veto, Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward suggested that both countries work together to reduce immigration, and he and James Burrill Angell negotiated with the Chinese to do so. Congress passed a new law to that effect, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, after Hayes left office.|$|E

25|$|Grant {{used the}} theory as {{justification}} for immigration {{policies of the}} 1920s, arguing that the immigrants from certain areas of Europe, such as Italians and other Southern Europeans and Eastern Europeans, represented a lesser type of European and their numbers in the United <b>States</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be increased. Grant and others urged this {{as well as the}} complete restriction of non-Europeans, such as the Chinese and Japanese.|$|E

Promoters of the weapon, {{including}} Teller, Ernest Lawrence, and Luis Alvarez, argued that such a development was inevitable, and to deny such protection {{to the people of}} the United States—especially when the Soviet Union was likely to create such a weapon themselves—was itself an immoral and unwise act.|$|E

This could not {{be further from the}} truth in regards to the Principality of Antioch. With the fall of Jerusalem in 1187 to Saladin it was Western Europe that immediately posed a threat to the Empire. A new Crusade was declared by the recently elected Pope Gregory VIII.|$|E

As Stewart describes it, the committee [...] "hijacked" [...] and remade the Constitution, altering critical agreements the Convention delegates had already made, enhancing {{the powers of the}} states {{at the expense of the}} national government, and adding several far-reaching provisions that the Convention had never discussed.|$|E

The reputation of the British Mission to Los Alamos was tarnished by the 1950 revelation that Fuchs was a Soviet atomic spy.

[...] Congress has the constitutional power to be the judge of whether those seeking to be its members are properly elected; Stevens urged that no senators or representatives from the South be seated.

[...] In the 1830s both sides pushed development into the disputed area, leading to petty conflicts (and by 1839 the possibility of war). [...] Massachusetts, which Maine had been a part of prior to 1820, maintained a property interest in some of the disputed land; Davis took a hard line on the matter, insisting that the United <b>States</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> surrender any of the territory it claimed.|$|E
