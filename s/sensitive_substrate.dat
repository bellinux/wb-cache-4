The main purpose of this detector is to provide a state-of-the-art solution for NPAs at ITER experimental reactor. In the past the NPAs were using very thin scintillators read out by photomultiplier tubes[3, 4], and their main drawbacks were poor energy resolution, intrinsic scintillation non-linearity, relative low count rate capability and finally poor signal-to-background separation for the low energy channels. The proposed U 3 DTHIN detector is based on very thin <b>sensitive</b> <b>substrate</b> which will provide nearly 100 % detection efficiency for ions {{and at the same time}} very low sensitivity for the neutron and gamma radiation background. To achieve a very fast charge collection of the carriers generated by the ions a 3 D electrode structure[5] has been introduced in the sensitive volume of the detector. One of the most innovative features of these detectors has been the optimal combination of the thin entrance window and the <b>sensitive</b> <b>substrate</b> thickness, to accommodate very large dynamic range primary ions energy.
