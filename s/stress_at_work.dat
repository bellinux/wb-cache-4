2500|$|High {{levels of}} stress are {{associated}} with substantial increases in health service utilization. [...] Workers who report experiencing <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> also show excessive health care utilization. In a 1998 study of 46,000 workers, health care costs were nearly 50% greater for workers reporting high {{levels of stress}} in comparison to “low risk” workers. The increment rose to nearly 150%, an increase of more than $1,700 per person annually, for workers reporting high levels of both stress and depression. Health care costs increase by 200% in those with depression and high occupational stress. Additionally, periods of disability due to job stress tend to be much longer than disability periods for other occupational injuries and illnesses.|$|E

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: An {{epidemiological}} cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To {{describe the}} impact of psychosocial factors, both work and nonwork-related, on the prevalence of low back pain (LBP) after 6. 6 years on average. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is growing consensus that psychosocial factors {{play a role in}} the development of LBP, although results are not consistent across studies. METHODS: Within a sample of 2556 middle-aged men and women from the Belstress study, baseline psychosocial factors were measured through self-administered questionnaires and related to prevalent cases of LBP after a mean time interval of 6. 6 years through Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: After adjustment for individual and physical risks, including occasional back pain at baseline, the prevalence rate of LBP in men is significantly related to baseline low decision latitude and low social support <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> and nonsignificantly to high job strain, low wage and job satisfaction, feeling <b>stressed</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> and feeling depressed. High job insecurity, feeling <b>stressed</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> and feeling depressed nonsignificantly increase the relative risks for LBP in women. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, psychosocial factors (both work and nonwork-related) constitute nonnegligible risks for the development of LBP.

2500|$|Job burnout {{stems from}} <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> [...] A person {{suffering}} from burnout is exhausted, cynical, and lacks motivation. [...] Similar to job stress, job burnout {{has also been}} related to the core self-evaluations construct. [...] Individuals with low core self-evaluations will consistently {{feel that they are}} unable to handle work tasks because they lack the ability or control. [...] For this reason, those with low core self-evaluations will be more susceptible to job burnout than those with high core self-evaluations, who appraise themselves positively and have {{confidence in their ability to}} manage the situation. [...] This is particularly important because of job burnout's consistent relationship with voluntary turnover behavior (e.g., individuals choosing to leave the job), which is very costly for all organizations.|$|E
2500|$|Problems at {{work are}} more {{strongly}} associated with health complaints than are any other life stressor-more so than even financial problems or family problems. Occupational stress {{accounts for more than}} 10% of work-related health claims. [...] Many studies suggest that psychologically demanding jobs that allow employees little control over the work process increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. [...] Research indicates that job stress increases the risk for development of back and upper-extremity musculoskeletal disorders. Other disorders that can be caused or exacerbated by occupational stress include sleep disorders, headache, mood disorders, upset stomach, hypertension, high cholesterol, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease, depression, and anxiety. <b>Stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> can also increase the risk of acquiring an infection and the risk of accidents at work.|$|E
2500|$|Job stress {{results from}} various {{interactions}} {{of the worker}} and {{the environment of the}} work they perform their duties. [...] Location, gender, environment, and many other factors contribute to the buildup of stress. [...] Job stress results from the interaction of the worker and the conditions of work. Views differ on the importance of worker characteristics versus working conditions as the primary cause of job stress. The differing viewpoints suggest different ways to prevent <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Differences in individual characteristics such as personality and coping skills can be very important in predicting whether certain job conditions will result in stress. [...] In other words, what is stressful for one person may not be a problem for someone else. This viewpoint underlies prevention strategies that focus on workers and ways to help them cope with demanding job conditions. In general, occupational stress is caused by a mismatch between perceived effort and perceived reward, and/or a sense of low control in a job with high demands. Low social support at work and job insecurity can also increase occupational stress. Psychosocial stressors are a major cause of occupational stress.|$|E

40|$|Background: Stress {{and burnout}} are {{prevalent}} among the caring professionals, including doctors and nurses. The work-related stress rate {{among the general}} working population is 18 % whilst among doctors it is around 28 %. Stress in general practitioners (GPs) can result in multiple negative consequences.

Method: A cross-sectional, descriptive study using a self-administered, standardised questionnaire (12 -item General Health Questionnaire [GHC]) {{was performed on the}} 30 general practitioners in Kwa-Dukuza. Confidentiality and anonymity were maintained. Results: 26 of the 30 GPs (87 %) responded to the survey. 10 GPs (38 %) were stressed as per the GHQ, six of whom were severely stressed. 22 reported that they felt <b>stressed</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> (subjectively). Conclusion: The results indicated that stress among Kwa-Dukuza GPs is slightly higher (38 %) than found in other studies that indicate a prevalence of 28 % among doctors. </p...|$|R
