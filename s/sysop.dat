25|$|Some {{general purpose}} Bulletin Board Systems had special levels of access that {{were given to}} those who paid extra money, {{uploaded}} useful files or knew the <b>SysOp</b> personally. These specialty and pay BBSes usually had something unique to offer their users, such as large file libraries, warez, pornography, chat rooms or Internet access.|$|E
25|$|At a <b>sysop</b> {{meeting in}} Dallas, {{the idea was}} raised {{that it would be}} nice if there was some way for the sysops to post {{messages}} that would be shared among the systems. In February 1986 Jeff Rush, one of the group members, introduced a new mailer that extracted messages from public forums that the <b>sysop</b> selected, in a manner similar to the way the original mailer handled private messages. The new program was known as a tosser/scanner. The tosser produced a file that was similar (or identical) to the output from the normal netmail scan, however, these files were then compressed and attached to a normal netmail message as an attachment. This message was then sent to a special address on the remote system. After receiving netmail as normal, the scanner on the remote system looked for these messages, unpacked them, and put them into the same public forum on the original system.|$|E

25|$|In this fashion, Rush's system {{implemented}} {{a store and}} forward public message system similar to Usenet, but based on, and hosted by, the FidoNet system. The first such echomail forum was one created by the Dallas area sysops to discuss business, known as <b>SYSOP.</b> Another called TECH soon followed. Several public echos soon followed, including GAYNET and CLANG. These spawned hundreds of new echos, {{and led to the}} creation of the Echomail Conference List (Echolist) by Thomas Kenny in January 1987. Echomail produced world-spanning shared forums, and its traffic volume quickly surpassed the original netmail system. By the early 1990s, echo mail was carrying over 8 MB of compressed message traffic a day, many times that when uncompressed.|$|E
25|$|As {{is it was}} prohibitively {{expensive}} for the hobbyist <b>SysOp</b> to have a dedicated connection to another system, FidoNet was developed as a store and forward network. Private email (Netmail), public message boards (Echomail) and eventually even file attachments on a FidoNet-capable BBS would be bundled into one or more archive files over a set time interval. These archive files were then compressed with ARC or ZIP and forwarded to (or polled by) another nearby node or hub via a dialup Xmodem session. Messages would be relayed around various FidoNet hubs until they were eventually delivered to their destination. The hierarchy of FidoNet BBS nodes, hubs, and zones was maintained in a routing table called a Nodelist. Some larger BBSes or regional FidoNet hubs would make several transfers per day, some even to multiple nodes or hubs, and as such, transfers usually occurred at night or early morning when toll rates were lowest. In Fido's heyday, sending a Netmail message to a user on a distant FidoNet node, or participating in an Echomail discussion could take days, especially if any FidoNet nodes or hubs in the message's route only made one transfer call per day.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most web forums, 4chan {{does not}} have a {{registration}} system, allowing users to post anonymously. Any nickname may be used when posting, even one that has been previously adopted, such as [...] "Anonymous" [...] or [...] "moot". In place of registration, 4chan has provided tripcodes as an optional form of authenticating a poster's identity. As making a post without filling in the [...] "Name" [...] field causes posts to be attributed to [...] "Anonymous", general understanding on 4chan holds that Anonymous is not a single person but a collective (hive) of users. Moderators generally post without a name even when performing <b>sysop</b> actions. A [...] "capcode" [...] may be used to attribute the post to [...] "Anonymous ## Mod", although moderators often post without the capcode. In a 2011 interview on Nico Nico Douga, Poole explained that there are approximately 20 volunteer moderators active on 4chan. 4chan also has a junior moderation team, called [...] "janitors", who may delete posts or images and suggest that the normal moderation team ban a user, but who can not post with a capcode. Revealing oneself as a janitor is grounds for immediate dismissal.|$|E
50|$|Around the {{beginning}} of 1990, there was a rift in the GT Power Network, resulting {{in the formation of}} a second network based on GT Power. The Alliance of Free <b>Sysops</b> Network, or AFSN, was formed, with some GT Power <b>sysops</b> finding ways to participate in both networks. By 1992, as AFSN <b>sysops</b> began migrating to other BBS software, the network had expanded to include both GT Power and QWK networking nodes, some of which had never run GT Power software. The AFSN either folded, or merged with another QWK network, sometime in the late 1990s.|$|R
