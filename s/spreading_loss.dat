According to Wiggins (1972), it provides a functional (computational) relationship between the model parameters and calculated values for the observed traces. Depending on the seismic data collected, this model may vary from the classical wave equations for predicting particle displacement or fluid pressure for sound wave propagation through rock or fluids, to some variants of these classical equations. For example, the forward model in Tarantola (1984) is the wave equation for pressure variation in a liquid media during seismic wave propagation while by assuming constant velocity layers with plane interfaces, Kanasewich and Chiu (1985) used the brachistotrone model of John Bernoulli for travel time of a ray along a path. In Cooke and Schneider (1983), the model is a synthetic trace generation algorithm expressed as in Eqn. 3, where R(t) is generated in the Z-domain by recursive formula.

An analysis {{of the impact of}} shallow water propagation on ESL was performed {{with the aid of a}} high performance computer using the FEPE_SYN and EXT_TD programs to compute the spreading of the received pulse due to multipath propagation in shallow water. A Blackman windowed pulse was used to model the transmitted pulse, which was centered at 3. 5 kHz, with 200 Hz bandwidth. For input parameters, typical seasonal sound speed profiles and a Hamilton geoacoustic model of Area Foxtrot off the U. S. eastern seaboard was used. ESL's impact on sonar performance was determined as a function of range, source and target depth, sound speed profiles and geoacoustic properties. The impact of shallow water propagation on the correlation of the transmitted and propagated pulses through the quantitative definition of mismatch loss (MML) was also discussed. The results showed that strong ESL (5 to 10 dB) existed over a sand (reflective) bottom and was generally invariant with range. ESL was correlated with TL, i. e., areas of high <b>spreading</b> <b>loss</b> were found in regions of high TL. ESL was not as large (3 to 5 dB) over silt/clay (absorptive) bottoms due to the increased absorption of the bottom refracted path thus reducing the number of multipath modes.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} several related {{pieces of}} work on underwater acoustic networks (UANs). Underwater wireless networks generally use acoustics, as radio is heavily attenuated and light is strongly scattered underwater. UANs are becoming more widely deployed for scientific, environmental, industrial, and military applications. The network nodes can be stationary sensor nodes, underwater vehicles, surface buoys or vehicles providing a gateway to radio networks, or bottom nodes providing a gateway to cabled undersea networks. Packet detection in interference in UANs, and its {{critical role in the}} effectiveness of collision-avoidance medium-access control (MAC) protocols, is a primary focus of this thesis. <b>Spreading</b> <b>loss</b> measures the decrease in received energy as a function of range, and determines the level of long-range interference. We present a new spreading model, the mixed-exponent spreading model, for UAN nodes using a matched-filter detector as a low-power wakeup detector. Under this model, there are distinct spreading-loss exponents for packet detection and interference, due to the matched-filter detector 2 ̆ 7 s signal processing. We validate this spreading model numerically, and with direct measurements of the spreading exponents from shallow-water experimental data. The widely used, but poorly grounded, 2 ̆ 2 practical spreading 2 ̆ 2 model is inconsistent with our experimental measurements. Our results suggest caution for its continued use to model performance of UANs. Building on our spreading analysis, we analyze the effectiveness of collision-avoidance MAC protocols in UANs, namely what fraction of collisions are avoided when using the protocol, independent of propagation delay. The low <b>spreading</b> <b>loss</b> in UANs, in particular with the mixed-exponent spreading model, can lead to low collision-avoidance effectiveness compared with radio networks. In addition, we argue that many UANs will be relatively mobile and sparse relative to terrestrial sensor networks, reducing the importance of network energy consumption and throughput of medium-access control protocols as metrics. This survey challenges some of the assumptions made in past UAN research, with a goal of aiding researchers entering the area of UANs from terrestrial sensor networks. Finally, we document the design decisions for a new underwater acoustic modem, as a contribution to researchers entering the field from terrestrial sensor networks. ...|$|E
