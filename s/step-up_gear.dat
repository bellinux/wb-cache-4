50|$|The photo {{shows the}} {{internal}} mechanism. The L-shaped handle has a gear rack, which spins the white <b>step-up</b> <b>gear,</b> {{which in turn}} spins the flywheel on which is mounted the dark grey magnet, seen on the lower left. The magnet induces an electric current in the red copper winding, seen on the lower right. The current from the copper winding flows through the filament of an incandescent light bulb (not shown), giving off light. A spring and ratchet returns the handle to its original position after each engagement.|$|E
50|$|The sport {{differential}} operates {{by using}} two superposition ("step up") gears at the differential, which are operated via multi-plate clutches {{each side of}} the differential crown wheel. When required by the software (using lateral and longitudinal yaw sensors, the ABS wheel sensors, and a steering wheel sensor), the control software (located in a control unit close to the rear differential), actuates the relevant clutch pack. This has the effect of taking the output shaft drive through the <b>step-up</b> <b>gear</b> to the attached wheel, while the other shaft continues to drive its wheel directly (i.e., the clutch pack not actuated). The higher speed output shaft produces increased torque to the wheel, producing a yaw (turning) moment. In normal operation increased torque is delivered to the wheel {{on the outside of the}} turn thereby increasing the vehicles turning moment, in other words, its willingness to turn in the direction pointed by the steering wheel.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{problems}} encountered in the fault diagnosis in damped rotor-bearing systems used in centrifugal milk separators. It is shown that direct bearing vibration measurements are more reliable than indirect (through rotor housing) vibration measurements. However, in most cases {{it is not possible}} to measure bearing vibrations directly. The factors causing large diagnostic measurement errors, such as the influence of the vibration damping system, <b>step-up</b> <b>gear</b> and electric motor noise are discussed in the paper. It is established that vibration measurements of the damping system are noninformative and cannot be used to diagnose faults in bearings. It is proposed to use the vibration spectra correlation to predict bearing failures in rotor-bearing systems of this type...|$|E
5000|$|The 6Q {{was built}} in both un{{supercharged}} and supercharged forms. The centrifugal supercharger was added {{at the back of}} the engine, driven off the crankshaft via <b>step-up</b> <b>gearing.</b> It added 13 kg to the weight and 242 mm to the length but boosted the performance at altitude to a continuous power of [...] at 2,500 rpm and 2200 m. Two pre-war models were optimised to different altitudes, the 02/03 right- and left-handed pair to 2000 m, with 7.61:1 gearing and the 04/05 pair to 4000 m, with 12.274 gearing.|$|R
5000|$|The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was {{a pioneer}} in the use of {{jackshaft}} driven locomotives. While the drive axle of the first Grasshopper locomotive was directly driven by spur gears from the crankshaft, the Traveler delivered in 1833, used a jackshaft, as did all the later Grasshopper and Crab locomotives. These locomotives used <b>step-up</b> <b>gearing</b> to achieve a reasonable running speed using small diameter driving wheels. It is notable that the term jackshaft was not used by the designers of these machines. Instead, they referred to what would later be called a jackshaft as [...] "a separate axle, about three feet forward of the front axle, and carrying cranks coupled by connecting rods to cranks on the two road axles." [...] In his 1837 patent for {{what became known as the}} crab class of locomotives, Ross Winans referred to his jackshaft as [...] "a pinion wheel shaft", or [...] "third axle." ...|$|R
2500|$|Almost {{immediately}} the T43 design {{was replaced by}} the Mark III version of the [...] "Formula Two" [...] chassis. Maddock and the Coopers upgraded the existing design by switching the front suspension for an improved double wishbone suspension arrangement with coilover shock absorbers, in place of the older cars' transverse leaf spring design. New <b>step-up</b> <b>gears</b> in the transaxle allowed Maddock to lower the engine (now including Climax's stretched [...] FPF in the works Formula One car), reducing the centre of gravity of the new Cooper T45 (Mark III) by mounting the dry-sump engine much lower. Maddock credited this particular innovation to Jack Brabham, who received the suggestion from his Australian friend, Ron Tauranac. Brabham and Cooper contributed other detail improvements, but Maddock left the fundamental chassis frame virtually unaltered from the T43. The T45 was immediately successful. In the hands of Maurice Trintignant, Rob Walker's new T45 won the very next World Championship round, the 1958 Monaco Grand Prix.|$|R
40|$|Output {{from the}} 200 -kilowatt machine {{will be enough}} to meet the power {{requirements}} of about 60 families. The experimental wind turbine generator (WTG) is a two-bladed, horizontal-axis, rotor system driving a synchronous electric generator through a <b>step-up</b> <b>gear</b> box located within a nacelle. The nacelle is mounted on top of a 100 -foot tower with the rotor located downwind from the tower. The 200 -kilowatt rated power output of the wind turbine is achieved at a turbine rotor speed of 40 rpm and a rated wind speed of 18. 3 mph. The rated wind speed is defined as the lowest wind speed at which full power is achieved. Attention is given to operational details, aspects of blade design, blade fabrication, the use of strain gages, questions of aeroelastic stability, and an early analysis of test data...|$|E
40|$|The {{realization}} of walking machine covers various tasks like the mechanical construction, {{the software and}} hardware design {{as well as the}} development of suitable control strategies. In the available work this is accomplished including experimental testing for a four-legged walking machine. The walking machine model consists of a central body and four identical, insect-like legs. To fulfill the requirement of the real time control, a rigid multibody system is selected for modelling. The appropriate motion equations are provided {{with the help of the}} method of the kinematic differentials. For the {{realization of}} the joint drives electrical direct current motor, incremental encoder and <b>step-up</b> <b>gears</b> are used. Accordingly the drive system is modelled in order to intend the demanded torque for the execution of the motion. The description of the movement takes place via the trajectory of the center of gravity and of the swing leg. Statically stable running is guaranteed by the so-called coordination mechanisms between the center of gravity and the legs. This movement strategy represents however still open loop control, whereby the desired movement cannot be achieved at high speeds. Therefore the so-called kinematic position control is used, which considers only the kinematic of the controlled system. As consequence the requirements to the under-stored drive controllers are particularly high. This high requirement can be fulfilled by the use of the microcontroller LM 629. In order to treat the reciprocal effect between the legs and the environment, the force control is used. This on simplified dynamics based force control can be used for the recognition of the leg collision. For the implementation of the presented movement strategy and the position control as well as the force control a computer system with two PC/ 104 CPUs is used. On the two processors the operating system real-time Linux is used. The useability of the developed strategy is examined by experimental investigations. The co-ordination mechanisms are extended by the necessary stability reserve. By the overlay of the center of gravity movement with a sinusoidal oscillation the stability of the machine can be increased...|$|R
