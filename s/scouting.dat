5|$|On {{his return}} to England, Baden-Powell noticed that boys showed {{considerable}} interest in Aids to <b>Scouting,</b> which was unexpectedly used by teachers and youth organizations as their first <b>Scouting</b> handbook. He was urged to rewrite this book for boys, especially during an inspection of the Boys' Brigade, a large youth movement drilled with military precision. Baden-Powell thought {{this would not be}} attractive and suggested that the Boys' Brigade could grow much larger were <b>Scouting</b> to be used. He studied other schemes, parts of which he used for <b>Scouting.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Scouting</b> {{virtually}} started itself, but {{the trigger}} that set it going was the 1908 publication of <b>Scouting</b> for Boys written by Robert Baden-Powell.

Later, as a military officer, Baden-Powell was stationed in British India in the 1880s where he took an interest in military <b>scouting</b> and in 1884 he published Reconnaissance and <b>Scouting.</b>|$|E
