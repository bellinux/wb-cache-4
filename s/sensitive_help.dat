In dark environment, ISO makes light sensor of camera more <b>sensitive.</b> It <b>helps</b> photographers to meet proper light in dark or harsh condition. Among above two photographs, the photograph 1 is a proper representation because it shows clear objects with proper brightness. However, ISO has high possibility to make camera noise which is visual distortion. Too much dependence on ISO can distort the image. For that reason, the photographers must understand ISO before using it.|$|R

Usability testing methods, such as observational interviews, provided fresh insights about how users are interacting with the library Web interface as they approach various information seeking tasks.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to create a}} tool (Advisor) for the {{development}} and use of online help systems. The study of human-computer interface issues is central to this task. In particular, attention has been given to the analysis of learning principles as related to interface strategies. The Advisor software is used by help designers to develop help systems and by application users to get assistance during applications use. It has two parts: the Designer (editor/outliner used by the help developer for help screen definition) and the Browser (help viewer used by the software end user for assistance from within an application). Using hypertext technology, the Advisory creates a tutorial environment where help screens and keyword links provide context <b>sensitive</b> <b>help</b> to assist the application user.

40|$|Virtual realities are {{a type of}} human-computer {{interface}} (HCI) and as such may be understood from a historical perspective. In the earliest era, the computer was a very simple, straightforward machine. Interaction was human manipulation of an inanimate object, {{little more than the}} provision of an explicit instruction set to be carried out without deviation. In short, control resided with the user. In the second era of HCI, some level of intelligence and control was imparted to the system to enable a dialogue with the user. Simple context <b>sensitive</b> <b>help</b> systems are early examples, while more sophisticated expert system designs typify this era. Control was shared more equally. In this, the third era of the HCI, the constructed system emulates a particular environment, constructed with rules and knowledge about 'reality'. Control is, in part, outside the realm of the human-computer dialogue. Virtual reality systems are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{building}} a user interface involves creating a large procedural program. Modelbased programming provides an alternative new paradigm. In the model-based paradigm, developers create a declarative model {{that describes the}} tasks that users are expected to accomplish with a system, the functional capabilities of a system, the style and requirements of the interface, the characteristics and preferences of the users, and the I/O techniques supported by the delivery platform. Based on the model, a much smaller procedural program then determines {{the behavior of the}} system. There are several advantages to this approach. The declarative model is a common representation that tools can reason about, enabling the construction of tools that automate various aspects of interface design, that assist system builders {{in the creation of the}} model, that automatically provide context <b>sensitive</b> <b>help</b> and other run-time assistance to users. The common model also allows the tools that operate on it t [...] ...|$|E

40|$|After {{training}} at Sheffield University {{and working in}} a variety of community-based agencies, Carole Addison spent four years as a social worker in a burns unit. Her present post with the London borough of Wandsworth is mainly concerned with the evaluation of social work practice. SUMMARY Social work in a bums unit exposes the practitioner to continuous and extreme stress, which arises both from the nature of the caseload and from the nature of the setting. Burned patients, and the staff who care for them, tend to adapt in characteristic ways to the suffering they encounter. The social worker, by going through a similar process of adaptation, can perhaps become able to offer <b>sensitive</b> <b>help</b> to patients without becoming overwhelmed. Stress can be contained more readily if informed personal support is available to the worker; however, because of certain features of the setting, such support is not always easily obtained. Although minor burns and scalds are relatively common, those which are sufficiently deep or extensive to produce serious or lasting consequence...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{availability of}} medical information resources has moved the "Medical Desktop" from a theoretical construct to a practical necessity. Many micro-computers are becoming available in clinical and academic settings that can access several medical information applications. These computers {{are usually not}} powerful workstations {{that are part of}} a clinically oriented information support system, but are personal computers with varied capabilities. The applications on these computers come from different sources, are accessed through different user interfaces and do not share data well. The de facto "Medical Desktop" this situation presents will discourage most end-users because the combination of applications is complex, the applications are poorly integrated, and individual applications are inconsistent. At the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences we have developed several Microsoft Windows-based tools that accept a systems level diversity of resources, but work toward the construction of a coherent "Medical Desktop. " These tools include a lexical term linker, a resource database, and a context <b>sensitive</b> <b>help</b> system that is tailored to locally available resources...|$|E
40|$|Session {{characteristics}} {{taken from}} large transaction logs of three Web search environments (academic Web site, public search engine, consumer health information por-tal) were modeled using cluster analysis {{to determine if}} coherent session groups emerged for each environ-ment and whether the types of session groups are similar across the three environments. The analysis revealed three distinct clusters of session behaviors common to each environment: “hit and run ” sessions on focused topics, relatively brief sessions on popular topics, and sustained sessions using obscure terms with greater query modification. The findings also revealed shifts in session characteristics over time {{for one of the}} datasets, away from “hit and run ” sessions toward more popular search topics. A better understanding of session char-acteristics can help system designers to develop more responsive systems to support search features that cater to identifiable groups of searchers based on their search behaviors. For example, the system may identify strug-gling searchers based on session behaviors that match those identified in the current study to provide context <b>sensitive</b> <b>help...</b>|$|E
