40|$|The {{steering}} system {{of a vehicle}} impacts on the vehicle performance, safety and on the driver’s comfort. Moreover, in off-road vehicles using hydrostatic <b>steering</b> systems, the <b>energy</b> <b>dissipation</b> also becomes a critical issue. These aspects push and motivate innovation, research and analysis {{in the field of}} agricultural tractors. This paper proposes the modelling and analysis of a hydrostatic {{steering system}} for an agricultural tractor to calculate the performance of the system and determine the influence of its main design parameters. The focus here is on the driver’s steering feel, which can improve the driver’s behavior reducing unnecessary steering corrections during the working conditions. The hydrostatic steering system is quite complex and involves a hydraulic circuit and a mechanical mechanism to transmit the steering to the vehicle tires. The detailed lumped parameters model here proposed allows to simulate the dynamic behavior of the steering system and to both enhance the understanding of the system and to improve the design through parameters sensitivity analysis...|$|R
