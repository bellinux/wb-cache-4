5|$|Alongside {{traditional}} piercing techniques, modern body adornment includes variant {{techniques such}} as pocketing and flesh <b>stapling,</b> although as of 2007 these were still not widely made available by piercers. In the first of these, a scalpel opens the skin or mucous membranes, into which the larger end {{of a piece of}} jewellery or—if using a bar—two ends are inserted. These kinds of piercings may be difficult to remove, as fibrous tissue can form around the end or ends of the jewellery or the implanted tube into which the jewellery is placed. When a bar is used, pocketing looks quite similar to flesh <b>stapling.</b> The latter technique is frequently done {{in the form of a}} ladder. Modern body piercing practices also include dermal anchoring or dermal piercing, which combines piercing and implantation to create a single point of opening in the body (whereas pocketing creates two) to permit one end of the jewellery to show above the surface of the skin. While this technique can be performed almost anywhere on the body, as of 2007 it was popularly done between the eyes, on the chest, or on the finger, to simulate a ring.|$|E

A variety of memory <b>staples</b> are available but their properties compared to standard <b>staples</b> are not known. We {{carried out a}} study comparing two popular types of memory <b>staples</b> and a standard stainless steel <b>staple.</b> Methods Standardized bone models of metatarsals made from Tufnol tubes were osteotomized and stabilised using one of three types of bone <b>staples,</b> two types of memory <b>staple</b> (Memory <b>staple</b> and heat-activated Memoclip) or a standard stainless steel <b>staple</b> (Richards). Constructs were loaded in bending and torsion on a material testing machine. The moment and torque to achieve 10 degree of bending or torsion and permanent angulation of the osteotomized bones were assessed. Results The Richards <b>staple</b> was found to provide a four times larger resistance to bending and torsion than the two memory <b>staples.</b> However, it was permanently deformed after bending. The Memory and Memoclip <b>staples</b> were equal in their stiffness. In addition, angulation of bones fixed with the Memoclip was elastic, preventing any permanent deformation. Conclusion The Richards <b>staple</b> was stiffer, although the permanent deformation of this <b>staple</b> is a disadvantage. Memoclip <b>staples</b> exhibit lower but adequate stiffnesss {{when compared to the}} standard Richards <b>staple</b> and are not permanently deformed after bending. The Memoclip <b>staples</b> were easier to handle. The results will enable surgeons to determine the optimal <b>staple</b> for foot and ankle procedures. </p...|$|R
