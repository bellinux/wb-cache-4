5|$|BAE Systems {{announced}} that, in December 2013, {{the company}} had test flown a Tornado equipped with parts that were made with 3D printing equipment. The parts included a protective cover for the radio, a landing-gear guard and air-intake door support struts. The test demonstrated the feasibility of making replacement parts quickly and cheaply at the air base hosting the Tornado. The company claimed that, {{with some of the}} parts costing less than £100 per piece to manufacture, 3D printing already resulted in <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> more than £300,000 and would offer further potential cost <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> more than £1.2million through 2017.|$|E

30|$|For {{complexity}} {{control of}} the frame layer, {{it is important to}} maintain good rate distortion performance. In the proposed algorithm, we estimate the actual time <b>saving</b> <b>of</b> the coded frame by considering the difference between the normal coding time of the coded frame and the actual coding time. Then, the following strategies are adopted. (1) If the sum of the actual time <b>saving</b> <b>of</b> already coded frames is greater than the target time <b>saving</b> <b>of</b> the entire sequence, normal coding is carried out in time to avoid degradation of the rate distortion performance. (2) When the sum <b>of</b> actual time <b>saving</b> <b>of</b> the coded frames is less than the target time <b>saving</b> <b>of</b> the entire sequence, the remaining frames still need to be encoded under control. (3) When the actual time <b>saving</b> <b>of</b> the previous frame is much greater than the target time <b>saving</b> <b>of</b> the previous frame, the degree of {{control of the}} current frame needs to be reduced. Therefore, the current frame only uses the CSD method to save the coding time and achieve better rate distortion performance.|$|R
6000|$|But {{perseverance}} {{is absolutely}} necessary to the complete <b>saving</b> <b>of</b> the soul, because he that falleth short of the state that they that are saved are possessed of, as saved, cannot arrive to that saved state. He that goeth to sea with a purpose to arrive at Spain, cannot arrive there if he be drowned by the way; wherefore perseverance {{is absolutely necessary}} to the <b>saving</b> <b>of</b> the soul, and therefore it {{is included in the}} complete <b>saving</b> <b>of</b> us--"Israel shall be saved in the Lord with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end" [...] (Isa 45:17).

5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the MTO {{undertook}} an engineering review of the entire route in search of cost inefficiencies. Highways 416 and 407 were constructed during a recession in the mid-1990s. Highway407 became a tolled highway {{and for a time}} it was mentioned in legislative debates that Highway416 would also be tolled, but ultimately this never happened. Instead, a hiatus in construction allowed engineers to evaluate inefficiencies in bridge and cross-section designs, as well as sensitive clay soils near Ottawa. This initiative led to a cost <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> over C$7 million and several of the unique design features located {{along the length of the}} freeway.|$|E
5|$|This {{would involve}} {{replacing}} the eight Pratt & Whitney TF33 engines (total thrust 8 × 17,000lb) with four RB211 engines (total thrust 4 × 37,400lb), which would increase range and reduce fuel consumption, {{at a cost}} of approximately US$2.56billion for the whole fleet (71 aircraft at $36 million each). However, an Air Force analysis in 1997 concluded that Boeing's estimated <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> US$4.7billion would not be realized and that re-engining would instead cost US$1.3billion over keeping the existing engines, citing significant up-front procurement and re-tooling expenditure, as well as the RB211's higher maintenance cost.|$|E
5|$|Two earlier {{business}} decisions by the Chicago Sun-Times led to substantial <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> {{time and money}} during the Trump Tower's construction. The original 1950s sea wall was built by the newspaper company to bomb-shelter thickness, to withstand a Cold War attack, and thus {{did not have to}} be broken down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant. This considerably reduced the costs and time for cleaning up the site prior to building anew.|$|E

5|$|With {{the fuel}} price {{increases}} of the 2000s, the EPA and many companies {{have sought to}} increase diesel truck fuel economy. One such example is the hydraulic hybrid vehicle, which stores energy in hydraulic tanks and hydraulic motors (as opposed to the electric hybrid vehicle which uses batteries and regenerative brakes). Electric hybrid vehicles are another option, with <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> 35 to 60 percent over traditional vehicles. Drivers themselves may improve fuel efficiency by using a method called progressive shifting, in which the driver shifts through the gears (typical trucks may have between 10 and 18 gears) {{in such a manner}} as to optimize the power range of the engine.|$|E
5|$|Without a {{recording}} budget, {{the band was}} forced to self-finance its debut album. Combining the <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> Araya, who was employed as a respiratory therapist, and money borrowed from King's father, the band entered the studio in November 1983. The album was rushed into release, hitting shelves three weeks after tracks were completed. Show No Mercy, released in December 1983 by Metal Blade Records, generated underground popularity for the band. The group began a club tour of California to promote the album. The tour gave the band additional popularity and sales of Show No Mercy eventually reached more than 20,000 in the US and another 20,000 worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In August 1999, the {{architect}} informed the project group that the Parliament {{would need to}} be further increased in size by 4,000squaremetres (43,000sqft). A subsequent costing revealed that taking into account the increased floorspace net construction costs had risen to £115m by September 1999. Early in 2000, the SPCB commissioned an independent report by {{the architect}} John Spencely. The report concluded that <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> 20% could be made on the current project and that scrapping the project completely at that stage or moving to another site would entail additional costs of £30m. Spencely also cited poor communication between the SPCB and construction officials as increasingly costly. Given the outcomes of the Spencely report, MSPs voted to continue with the construction project on the Holyrood site in a debate in the Scottish Parliament on 5 April 2000.|$|E

5|$|In total, 36% of all {{materials}} and labour costs were spent in Wales, with approximately 1,000tonnes (157,500 stone) of Welsh slate used. The environmental {{features of the}} building have allowed energy <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> between 30% and 50% compared to buildings without these features. The features include 27 pipes that were drilled 100m below ground, so that during cold spells, water is pumped through the pipes and heated to 14°C by geothermal energy. The hot water is then pumped {{back up to the}} slate floor to warm the building to a constant temperature. In warm spells, the same system helps to keep the building cool. A biomass boiler was installed to use wood chips from recycled waste wood to heat the building, and rainwater is collected from the roof to flush the toilets in the building.|$|E
5|$|On February 16, 1965, the New York City Transit Authority {{announced}} plans to construct a subway station on the island along the planned 63rd Street Line, {{as part of the}} island's proposed transit-oriented development (TOD). TOD tries {{to increase the amount of}} residential, business and leisure space within walking distance of public transport. With this announcements, more suggestions for what to do with the island were made. The construction of a station was viewed to be vital for the development of the island, which was still known as Welfare Island. At that point, it was decided to build a shell for the station, to allow for the station to open after the opening of the rest of the line, with a projected <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> $4 million compared to building the station as an infill station after the rest of the line opened. The projected cost of the station was $3,300,000. It was soon decided to build the station with the rest of the line.|$|E
5|$|Szilard {{received}} German {{citizenship in}} 1930, but was already {{uneasy about the}} political situation in Europe. When Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany on January 30, 1933, Szilard urged {{his family and friends}} to flee Europe while they still could. He moved to England, and transferred his <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> £1,595 (£ today) from his bank in Zurich to one in London. He lived in hotels where lodging and meals cost about £5/5 a week. For those less fortunate, he helped found the Academic Assistance Council, an organization dedicated to helping refugee scholars find new jobs, and persuaded the Royal Society to provide accommodation for it at Burlington House. He enlisted the help of academics such as Harald Bohr, G. H. Hardy, Archibald Hill and Frederick G. Donnan. By the outbreak of World War II in 1939, it had helped to find places for over 2,500 refugee scholars.|$|E

5|$|The General Assembly {{approved}} $250 {{million in}} spending cuts and Daniels renegotiated 30 different state contracts for a <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> $190 million, {{resulting in a}} budget of $23 billion. Annual spending growth for future budgets was cut to 2.8% from the 5.9% that had been standard for many years. Increase in revenues, coupled with the spending reductions, led to a $300 million budget surplus. Indiana is not permitted to take loans, as borrowing was prohibited in its constitution following the 1837 state bankruptcy. The state, therefore, had financed its deficit spending by reallocating $760 million in revenue that belonged to local government and school districts {{over the course of}} many years. The funds were gradually and fully restored to the municipal governments using the surplus money, and the state reserve fund was grown to $1.3 billion.|$|E
5|$|Bob Ayling's {{leadership}} {{led to a}} cost <b>savings</b> <b>of</b> £750m and {{the establishment}} of a budget airline, Go, in 1998. The next year, however, British Airways reported an 84% drop in profits in its first quarter alone, its worst in seven years. In March 2000, Ayling was removed from his position and British Airways announced Rod Eddington as his successor. That year, British Airways and KLM conducted talks on a potential merger, reaching a decision in July to file an official merger plan with the European Commission. The plan fell through in September 2000. British Asia Airways ceased operations in 2001 after BA suspended flights to Taipei. Go was sold to its management and the private equity firm 3i in June 2001. Eddington would make further workforce cuts due to reduced demand following 11 September attacks in 2001, and BA sold its stake in Qantas in September 2004. In 2005 Willie Walsh, managing director of Aer Lingus and a former pilot, became {{the chief executive officer of}} British Airways. BA unveiled its new subsidiary OpenSkies in January 2008, taking advantage of the liberalisation of transatlantic traffic rights between Europe and the United States. OpenSkies flies non-stop from Paris to New York's JFK and Newark airports.|$|E
