40|$|Action {{potentials}} {{in higher}} plants {{are believed to}} be the information carriers in intercellular and intracellular communication in the presence of an environmental stressor. Plant electrophysiologists have recorded long distance electrical signaling in higher plants during the last two hundred years. Reproducing the duration, speed of propagation, and the shape of the action potential is challenging. Early measurements revealed that the speed of action potential propagation in plants is extremely slow - from 0. 1 mm/s to 20 cm/s, although many faster plant responses to stress have been recorded as well. We hypothesized that this discrepancy is most likely due to the artifacts of aliasing from <b>slow</b> <b>registration</b> systems. In this study, we employ real time measurements using modern data acquisition techniques to detect ultra fast action potentials in green plants induced by localized heat stress. Thermal shock or heat stress is the most common environmental stress. Based on more sophisticated measuring techniques, we show that plants transmit solitary waves and that the speed of action potential propagation in green plants is similar to the speed of action potentials in mammalians, varying from a few meters per second up to 105 m/s. Possible pathways for electrical signal propagation in vascular plants are discussed...|$|E

Methods: The Japan Clinical Oncology Group conducted a phase III trial for a 3 -year period starting from October 1994 to determine whether intraoperative intrapleural hypotonic cisplatin treatment could effectively control pleural disease and thereby prolong the survival of these patients. The patients were randomized to receive either intraoperative intrapleural hypotonic cisplatin treatment or no treatment before closure of the open thorax. The intraoperative intrapleural hypotonic cisplatin treatment consisted of exposing the entire thorax to cisplatin (50 μg/mL) in distilled water for 15 minutes. Results: Because of the <b>slow</b> <b>registration</b> pace, the study was prematurely terminated in January 1998. During the 41 -month period {{from the start of the}} registration, 49 patients were entered into the study, and all were eligible. Twenty-five and 24 patients were randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups, respectively. No statistically significant difference in the overall survival and disease-free survival between the 2 groups was observed. However, the appearance of carcinomatous pleuritis was suppressed by the hypotonic cisplatin treatment (42 % of the control group vs 8 % of the treatment group, P =. 008). Conclusions: Although the randomized trial was prematurely terminated, the intraoperative intrapleural hypotonic cisplatin treatment was found to effectively suppress the appearance of carcinomatous pleuritis in resected patients who demonstrated a positive pleural lavage cytology finding.

However, its impact on initially unresectable, previously untreated advanced CRC, regardless of concurrent metastases, remains to be clarified. Methods: A Phase II {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the safety and efficacy of perioperative FOLFOX 4 plus bevacizumab for initially unresectable advanced CRC. Patients with previously untreated advanced colon or rectal cancer initially diagnosed as unresectable advanced CRC (TNM stage IIIb, IIIc, or IV) but potentially resectable after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) were studied. Preoperatively, patients received six cycles of NAC (five cycles of neoadjuvant FOLFOX 4 plus bevacizumab followed by one cycle of FOLFOX 4 alone). The interval between the last dose of bevacizumab and surgery was at least 5 weeks. Six cycles of adjuvant FOLFOX 4 plus bevacizumab were given after surgery. The completion rate of NAC and feasibility of curative surgery were the primary endpoints. Results: An interim analysis was performed at the end of NAC in the 12 th patient to assess the completion rate of NAC. The median follow-up time was 56 months. The characteristics of the patients were as follows: sex, eight males and four females; tumor location, sigmoid colon in three, ascending colon in one, and rectum (above the peritoneal reflection) in eight; stage, III in eight and IV in four (liver or lymph nodes). All patients completed six cycles of NAC. There were no treatment-related severe adverse events or deaths. An objective response to NAC was achieved in nine patients (75 %), and no disease progression was observed. Eleven patients underwent curative tumor resection, including metastatic lesions. In December 2012, this Phase II study was terminated because of <b>slow</b> <b>registration.</b> Conclusion: Perioperative FOLFOX 4 plus bevacizumab is well tolerated and has a promising response rate leading to curative surgery, which offers a survival benefit in initially unresectable advanced CRC with concurrent metastatic lesions.

40|$|Purpose: Our {{goal was}} to {{validate}} linear and nonlinear intersubject image registration using an automated method (AIR 3. 0) based on voxel intensity. Method: PET and MRI data from 22 normal subjects were registered to corresponding averaged PET or MRI brain atlases using several specific linear and nonlinear spatial transformation models with an automated algorithm. Validation was based on anatomically defined landmarks. Results: Automated registration produced results that were superior to a manual nine parameter variant of the Talairach registration method. Increasing the degrees of freedom in the spatial transformation model improved the accuracy of automated intersubject registration. Conclusion: Linear or nonlinear automated intersubject registration based on voxel intensities is computationally practical and produces more accurate alignment of homologous landmarks than manual nine parameter Talairach registration. Nonlinear models provide better registration than linear models but are <b>slower.</b> <b>Registration</b> of tomographic images acquired from different subjects poses unique problems not encountered with intrasubject registration.

40|$|The {{first presidential}} {{election}} following {{implementation of the}} National Voter Registration Act of 1993 {{was also the first}} in the lifetimes of most Americans in which a minority of the voting-age population bothered to vote. While that outcome must be a source of embarrassment to many reform advocates, this study has shown that the turnout decline was in fact substantially <b>slowed</b> by <b>registration</b> reform. Moreover, the full effects of the key “motor voter” innovation have yet to be felt in at least two-thirds of the states, representing more than three quarters of the voting-age population. Similarly, the disproportionately large turnout decline among the young would have been even more extreme in the absence of reform, based on evidence obtained in this study. Little evidence of other progressive effects [...] by race, education, income, or mobility status [...] is found however. Finally, although partisan identification and presidential voting moved in the Democrats’ direction between 1992 and 1996, registration reform appears to have slightly favored the Republicans. The shift toward Democratic ID and voting was largest in the states with the least reform, while the largest shift away from Democratic ID occurred in the states with the most extensive reform. ...|$|R
40|$|Diffusion tensor imaging {{is widely}} used in brain {{connectivity}} research. As more and more studies recruit large numbers of subjects, {{it is important to}} design registration methods which are not only theoretically rigorous, but also computationally efficient. However, the requirement of reorienting diffusion tensors complicates and considerably <b>slows</b> down <b>registration</b> procedures, due to the correlated impacts of registration forces at adjacent voxel locations. Based on the diffeomorphic Demons algorithm (Vercauteren, 2009), we propose a fast local trust region algorithm for handling inseparable registration forces for quadratic energy functions. The method guarantees that, at any time and at any voxel location, the velocity is always within its local trust region. This local regularization allows efficient calculation of the transformation update with numeric integration instead of completely solving a large linear system at every iteration. It is able to incorporate exact reorientation and regularization into the velocity optimization, and preserve the linear complexity of the diffeomorphic Demons algorithm. In an experiment with 84 diffusion tensor images involving both pair-wise and group-wise registrations, the proposed algorithm achieves better registration in comparison with other methods solving large linear systems (Yeo, 2009). At the same time, this algorithm reduces the computation time and memory demand tenfold. © 1982 - 2012 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Many {{industrial}} applications require dense point clouds of the installations. Acquisition of the rooms, filled with many objects, of an industrial scene leads to many Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) stations. A precise registration {{of all the}} per-station point clouds is crucial for the required accuracy of 1 - 2 cm of final data. Targets and tachometry, current best practice for <b>registration,</b> <b>slows</b> down the survey and limits the number of campaigns. Indoor geolocation system are faster but do not reach the final required accuracy. Otherwise, 3 D primitives can be automatically extracted from the dense point clouds and possibly used for registration. In a four step primitive-based registration, Acquisition – Reconstruction – Matching – Solving, the matching is crucial. This article presents a probabilistic test for 3 D lines matching using a priori distributions of approximated transformations. The stochastic model of approximated transformations and resulting uncertain lines is introduced. A test is performed on a real dataset of an industrial scene {{and the results are}} analysed. Improvements of the presented test and matching framework are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy (LLLS) {{has been}} {{associated}} with shorter hospital stay and reduced overall morbidity compared with open left lateral sectionectomy (OLLS). Strong evidence has not, however, been provided. METHODS: In this multicentre double-blind RCT, patients (aged 18 - 80 [*]years with a BMI of 18 - 35 [*]kg/m(2) and ASA fitness grade of III or below) requiring left lateral sectionectomy (LLS) were assigned randomly to OLLS or LLLS within an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programme. All randomized patients, ward physicians and nurses were blinded to the procedure undertaken. A parallel prospective registry (open non-randomized (ONR) versus laparoscopic non-randomized (LNR)) was used to monitor patients who were not enrolled for randomization because of doctor or patient preference. The primary endpoint was time to functional recovery. Secondary endpoints were length of hospital stay (LOS), readmission rate, overall morbidity, composite endpoint of liver surgery-specific morbidity, mortality, and reasons for delay in discharge after functional recovery. RESULTS: Between January 2010 and July 2014, patients were recruited at ten centres. Of these, 24 patients were randomized at eight centres, and 67 patients from eight centres were included in the prospective registry. Owing to slow accrual, the trial was stopped on the advice of an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board in the Netherlands. No significant difference in median (i. q. r.) time to functional recovery was observed between laparoscopic and open surgery in the randomized or non-randomized groups: 3 (3 - 5) days for OLLS versus 3 (3 - 3) days for LLLS; and 3 (3 - 3) days for ONR versus 3 (3 - 4) days for LNR. There were no significant differences with regard to LOS, morbidity, reoperation, readmission and mortality rates. CONCLUSION: This RCT comparing open and laparoscopic LLS in an ERAS setting was not able to reach a conclusion on time to functional recovery, because it was stopped prematurely owing to <b>slow</b> accrual. <b>Registration</b> number: NCT 00874224 ([URL]...|$|R
40|$|In modern PET/CT systems, the CT {{provides}} a fast and relatively noise-free attenuation map and improving lesions localization {{and the possibility}} of accurate quantitative analysis. In cardiac imaging, there is a strong attenuation gradient along the myocardial free wall, with muscle next to the air of the lung space and heart has movement and located in the place that move due to breathing cause misalignment increases in this area. If misalignments occur along these boundaries, the attenuation correction factors are potentially inaccurate, causing as much as a 60 % error in the PET tracer emission image in the critical regions of diagnostic interest. Artifacts caused by misalignment are particularly disconcerting in cardiac imaging because they can present themselves as perfusion abnormalities or erroneous information on myocardial viability. In This paper the accuracy of some CT protocols such as gated, normal (a high-pitch helical CT), slow ct, low-temporal-resolution helical CT, time-averaged CT (ACT), ultra low dose CT that normally used for attenuation-correction in PET/CT were compared, moreover the image quality and dose that induced to patient from each protocols. Acquiring a <b>slow</b> CT improved <b>registration</b> between the transmission and emission. Potential for a heightened radiation dose delivered by the slow CT was compensated by doubling the default noise index and increasing the slice thickness to 5 mm. In the low-dose average cine CT, Further reduction in dose is possible by lowering the upper threshold of the auto-mA settings or modulation of the CT tube current based on anatomy. ACT protocols consist of multiple images acquired sequentially (also referred to as cine or axial) along the bed length over the span of one or more respiratory cycles. 2 % average increase in ACT-PET rest reconstruction values compared the HCT-PET rest reconstruction values was slightly higher than the bias calculated. Contrary to the HCT protocol, the ACT protocol provides more flexibility in addressing artifacts such as varying the respiratory phases used to create the time-averaged CT to suppress respiratory artifacts. In addition, photon starvation can be addressed by optimizing the acquisition parameters, such as increasing the tube voltage and current in patients with high BMI values.
