500|$|Mike D'Antonio owns {{a graphic}} design company called Darkicon Designs {{and has made}} album covers and various other pieces of art (T-shirts, posters, logos, etc.) for bands such as Shadows Fall, All That Remains, Crowbar among others. Killswitch Engage made sure to have written in their {{contract}} with Roadrunner that D'Antonio would produce all of the band's artwork. D'Antonio stated about the cover of Alive or Just Breathing, [...] "I wanted <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> 'old school cut-and-paste' for the cover. Something with texture that appeared like it was just laid down and photographed. I remember Roadrunner hating the cover, saying {{there was too much}} going on and nothing to focus on. I told them I did not agree, and that some day they would get it." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Sally Jenkins, in her Sports Illustrated {{article on}} Carlisle:To take {{advantage}} of the Indians' versatility Warner drew up a new offense... "the Carlisle formation," [...] but later it would be known as the single wing. It was predicated on one small move: Warner shifted a halfback out wide, to outflank the opposing tackle, forming <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> like a wing. It opened up a world of possibilities. The Indians could line up as if to punt – and then throw. No one would know whether they were going to run, pass or kick. For added measure Warner taught his quarterbacks to sprint out a few yards to their left or their right, buying more time to throw. The rest of the players flooded downfield and knocked down any opponent who might be able to intercept or bat away the pass.|$|E
500|$|Art {{designer}} Sylvain Despretz {{claimed the}} art department {{was assigned to}} create something that had {{little or nothing to}} do with the Superman comic book, and also explained that Peters [...] "would bring kids in, who would rate the drawings on the wall as if they were evaluating the toy possibilities. It was basically a toy show." [...] Peters saw a cover of National Geographic, containing a picture of a skull, going to art department workers, telling them he wanted the design for Brainiac's space ship to have the same image. Burton gave Despretz a concept drawing for Brainiac, which Despretz claims was [...] "a cone with a round ball on top, and <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> like an emaciated skull inside. Imagine you take Merlin's hat, and you stick a fish bowl on top, with a skull in it." [...] Concept artist Rolf Mohr said in an interview he designed a suit for the Eradicator for a planned scene in which it transforms into a flying vehicle.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, the thrall girl {{went from}} one tent {{to the other}} and had sexual {{intercourse}} with the men. Every man told her: [...] "Tell your master that I did this because of my love to him". In the afternoon, they moved the thrall girl to <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> like a door frame, where she was lifted on the palms of the men three times. Every time, the girl told them what she saw. The first time, she saw her father and mother, the second time, she saw all her relatives, and the third time she saw her master in the afterworld. There, it was green and beautiful and together with him, she saw men and young boys. She saw that her master beckoned for her. By using intoxicating drinks, they thought to put the thrall girl in an ecstatic trance that made her psychic and through the symbolic action with the door frame, she would then see into the realm of the dead. The same ritual also appears in the Icelandic short story [...] "Völsa þáttr," [...] where two pagan Norwegian men lift the lady of the household over a door frame to help her look into the otherworld.|$|E
500|$|Tim Miller, {{creative}} {{director for the}} title sequence, wanted to develop an abstract narrative that reflected the pivotal moments in the novel, {{as well as the}} character development of Lisbeth Salander. It was arduous for Miller to conceptualize the sequence abstractly, given that Salander's occupation was a distinctive part of her personality. His initial ideas were modeled after a keyboard. [...] "We were going to treat the keyboard like this giant city with massive fingers pressing down on the keys," [...] Miller explained, [...] "Then we transitioned to the liquid going through the giant obelisks of the keys." [...] Among Miller's many vignettes was [...] "The Hacker Inside", which revealed the character's inner disposition and melted them away. The futuristic qualities in the original designs provided for a much more cyberpunk appearance than the final product. In creating the [...] "cyber" [...] look for Salander, Miller said, [...] "Every time I would show David a design he would say, 'More Tandy!' It's the shitty little computers from Radio Shack, the Tandy computers. They probably had vacuum tubes in them, really old technology. And David would go 'More Tandy', until we ended up with <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> like we glued a bunch of computer parts found at a junkyard together." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{follows from}} the causal theory of reference. Words always refer {{to the kinds of}} things they were coined to refer to, thus the kinds of things their user, or the user's ancestors, {{experience}}d. So, if some person, Mary, were a [...] "brain in a vat", whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the [...] "mad scientist", then Mary's idea of a [...] "brain" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] brain, since she and her linguistic community have never seen such a thing. Rather, she saw <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> like a brain, but was actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Similarly, her idea of a [...] "vat" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] vat. So, if, as a brain in a vat, she were to say [...] "I'm a brain in a vat", she would actually be saying [...] "I'm a brain-image in a vat-image", which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, but now because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological externalism: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally.|$|E

5000|$|... "Beaten with an ugly stick" [...] and its {{grammatical}} forms ("It {{looks like}} someone beat object with an ugly stick," [...] etc.) are an American English idiom used {{in reference to}} someone or <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> ugly or unappealing.|$|R
500|$|The host {{performed}} each {{episode in}} front of a [...] "blue screen", with animation added later. The show's digital design department combined high-tech and low-tech methods by creating and photographing three-dimensional objects, then cutting them out and placing them into the background. This made the objects look more real and added perspective and depth. Their animation technique was at that time a new technology. Johnson hired artist Dave Palmer and production company Big Pink to create the animation from simple materials like fabric, paper, or pipe-cleaners, and scan them into a Macintosh computer so that they could be animated using inexpensive computer software such as Media 100, Ultimatte, Photoshop and After Effects, instead of being repeatedly redrawn as in traditional animation. The result was <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> different from anything else on television at the time, and the producers were able to animate two episodes in eight weeks, as compared to the sixteen weeks necessary to create a single episode by traditional methods. Their process looked like traditional cut-out animation, but was faster, more flexible, and less expensive, and it allowed them to make changes based on feedback from test audiences. Unlike traditional animation environments, which tended to be highly structured, the animators were given information about the characters and goals of the scenes they would animate, and then given the freedom to work out the timing and look of each scene themselves, as long as their creations were true to the characters and to the story. By 1999, the show's animation department consisted of Palmer, 20 animators, 11 digital designers, and 5 art directors and model makers. By 2002, Nickelodeon had built a [...] "state-of-the-art" [...] $6 million digital animation studio that housed 140 people, including 70 animators.|$|E
500|$|On the red suit, Maslansky said, [...] "We wanted <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> militaristic and functional, {{but also}} {{dramatic}} and sexy" [...] {{adding that it}} was [...] "tricky" [...] making it practical. To {{begin the process of}} creating the suit, Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on Daredevil comics, gave several suggestions, including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit, which led to the use of rivets and [...] "architectural" [...] shapes. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists highlighted certain areas with red, with [...] "deeper portions" [...] in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, [...] "because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor’s face is going to be doing something else". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by Andy Park, discussions were had about having them holstered on the right leg, given that both Cox and his stunt double Chris Brewster are right handed, but it was ultimately decided to have the holster on the left hand side {{as it is in the}} [...] "classic profile" [...] of the comics. DeKnight explained that Murdock's Daredevil suit does not have the [...] "DD" [...] emblem on the chest as seen in the comics, because Murdock receives his moniker only after the suit is introduced. He also felt that the emblem was [...] "one of the more problematic emblems in superhero-dom", and that Daredevil's suit in the comics was [...] "very difficult to translate to screen, especially in this world that is grounded and gritty".|$|E
2500|$|Stephenson {{explained}} {{the title of}} the novel in his 1999 essay [...] "In the Beginning... Was the Command Line" [...] as his term for a particular software failure mode on the early Apple Macintosh computer. Stephenson wrote about the Macintosh that [...] "When the computer crashed and wrote gibberish into the bitmap, the result was <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> vaguely like static on a broken television set—a 'snow crash' ". Stephenson has also mentioned that Julian Jaynes' book The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind {{was one of the main}} influences on Snow Crash.|$|E
50|$|What {{we need is}} <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> highly respectable outwardly. The American Mercury {{is almost}} perfect for that purpose.
