40|$|We study {{stochastic}} linear [...] quadratic (LQ) {{optimal control}} problems over an infinite horizon, allowing the cost matrices to be indefinite. We develop a systematic approach based on semidefinite programming (SDP). A central {{issue is the}} stability of the feedback control; and we show this can be effectively examined through the complementary duality of the SDP. Furthermore, we establish <b>several</b> <b>implication</b> relations among the SDP complementary duality, the (generalized) Riccati equation,and the optimality of the LQ control problem. Based on these relations, we propose a numerical procedure that provides a thorough treatment of the LQ control problem via SDP: it identifies a stabilizing feedback control that is optimal or determines that the problem possesses no optimal solution. For the latter case, we develop an Îµ-approximation scheme that is asymptotically optimal. semidefinite programming;complementary duality;generalized Riccati equation;mean-square stability;stochastic LQ control...|$|R

LEMD3 also has <b>several</b> <b>implications</b> in regulating the cytokine family such as the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and bone morphogenic protein (BMPs). The RRM domain in its carboxylic region attaches to the SMAD (protein) proteins, which is involved in mediating TGF-β cellular signalling. Consequently, LEMD3 indirectly regulates downstream genes.|$|E

50|$|In {{information}} security, computational {{trust is}} {{the generation of}} trusted authorities or user trust through cryptography. In centralised systems, security is typically based on the authenticated identity of external parties. Rigid authentication mechanisms, such as Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs) or Kerberos have allowed this model to be extended to distributed systems within a few closely collaborating domains or within a single administrative domain. During recent years, computer science has moved from centralised systems to distributed computing. This evolution has <b>several</b> <b>implications</b> for security models, policies and mechanisms needed to protect users’ information and resources in an increasingly interconnected computing infrastructure.|$|E
50|$|As for {{symmetry}} in {{the usual}} sense of the term, we may start with the theorem that the symmetries of the -dimensional Laplace equation are exactly the conformal symmetries of the -dimensional Euclidean space. This fact has <b>several</b> <b>implications.</b> First of all, one can consider harmonic functions which transform under irreducible representations of the conformal group or of its subgroups (such as the group of rotations or translations). Proceeding in this fashion, one systematically obtains the solutions of the Laplace equation which arise from separation of variables such as spherical harmonic solutions and Fourier series. By taking linear superpositions of these solutions, one can produce large classes of harmonic functions which can {{be shown to be}} dense in the space of all harmonic functions under suitable topologies.|$|E
50|$|Santanichthys diasii is {{the only}} species within the genus Santanichthys. It is {{classified}} in the order Characiformes, an order that includes the tetras. Analysis of its morphological characters, including the presence of enlarged lagenar capsules has placed {{it as one of}} the most basal characiforms. This, combined with the Early Cretaceous origin of these specimens, makes Santanichthys the earliest known otophysan; The next characiforms up the fossil record date from the Late Cretaceous period already. This has <b>several</b> <b>implications</b> on the evolution of the Characiformes. All modern characiforms are strictly freshwater species. The Santana Formation is a marine sedimentary formation and thus Santanichthys was most likely an inhabitant of brackish or marine waters. This supports a marine-to-freshwater model of the evolution and dispersal of characiform species from the breakup of the continent Gondwana (Africa and South America) to the present day.|$|E

40|$|To most {{individuals}} saving for retirement {{is the number}} one financial goal. However, it reveals a complex task and induces serious behavioral problems which cannot be explained by traditional economic theory. This paper investigates the role of behavioral asset selection on retirement portfolios in Germany. Simulated behavioral portfolios show (i) an impact of emotions since pessimism (optimism) induces the most conservative (aggressive) portfolio, (ii) concentrated portfolios with a large position in only one secure asset and a small position in a risky portfolio, and (iii) a large difference to mean-variance portfolios in terms of level of diversification. I conclude that behavioral portfolio theory has remarkably power in understanding, describing and selecting retirement portfolios in Germany. The results have <b>several</b> <b>implication</b> for financial planning, e. g. for an ``auto-pilot'' solution to encourage people to more retirement saving. behavioral portfolio choice, decision making under risk, retirement portfolios...|$|R
