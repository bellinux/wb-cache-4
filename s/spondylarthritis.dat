40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the gene NOD 2 in susceptibility to, and clinical manifestations of, ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: A case-control study of NOD 2 polymorphisms known to be associated with Crohn's disease (CD) (Pro(268) Ser, Arg(702) Trp, Gly(908) Arg, and Leu(1007) fsinsC) was performed in 229 cases of primary AS with no diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 197 cases of AS associated with IBD (referred to as colitic spondylarthritis; comprising 78 with CD and 119 with ulcerative colitis [UC]), and 229 ethnically matched, healthy controls. Associations between NOD 2 polymorphisms and several clinical features of AS, including disease severity assessed by questionnaire and age at <b>spondylarthritis</b> onset, were also investigated. Exclusion linkage mapping of chromosome 16 was performed in a separate group of 185 multicase families with AS. RESULTS: An association was identified between Gly(908) Arg and UC <b>spondylarthritis</b> (P = 0. 016, odds ratio [OR] 4. 6, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 1. 3 - 16), and a nonsignificant trend with a similar magnitude was observed in association with CD <b>spondylarthritis</b> (P = 0. 08, OR 3. 9, 95 % CI 0. 8 - 18). The Pro(268) Ser variant was inversely associated with UC <b>spondylarthritis</b> (P = 0. 003, OR 0. 55, 95 % CI 0. 37 - 0. 82), but not with CD <b>spondylarthritis.</b> No association was demonstrated between NOD 2 variants and primary AS, or between other variants of NOD 2 and either UC or CD <b>spondylarthritis.</b> Carriage of the Pro(268) Ser polymorphism was associated with greater disease activity as measured by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (P = 0. 002). Although patients with CD had a younger age at <b>spondylarthritis</b> onset than did those with UC (22. 4 years versus 26. 4 years; P = 0. 01), no association was noted between the NOD 2 variants linked with CD and age at <b>spondylarthritis</b> onset. In primary AS, the presence of a gene with a magnitude of association > 2. 0 was excluded (exclusion logarithm of odds score less than - 2. 0), and no association was observed with the microsatellite D 16 S 3136. CONCLUSION: NOD 2 variants do not significantly affect the risk of developing primary AS, but may influence susceptibility to, and clinical manifestations of, colitic <b>spondylarthritis...</b>|$|E

We undertook this study to ascertain if patients with <b>spondylarthritis</b> express beta(2) -microglobulin-free HLA-B 27 heavy chains {{in the form of}} homodimers and receptors for HLA-B 27 homodimers. METHODS: Expression of HLA-B 27 heavy chains by mononuclear cells was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter staining, Western blotting with the monoclonal antibody HC- 10, and 2 -dimensional isoelectric focusing. Fluorescence-labeled tetrameric complexes of HLA-B 27 heavy-chain homodimers were constructed in which each dimer comprised one His-tagged heavy chain and one biotinylated heavy chain, and were used to stain patient and control mononuclear cells and transfected cell lines. RESULTS: Patients with <b>spondylarthritis</b> expressed cell-surface HLA-B 27 homodimers. Populations of synovial and peripheral blood monocytes, and B and T lymphocytes from patients with <b>spondylarthritis,</b> and controls carried receptors for HLA-B 27 homodimers. Experiments with transfected cell lines demonstrated that KIR 3 DL 1 and KIR 3 DL 2, and immunoglobulin-like transcript 4 (ILT 4), but not ILT 2, are receptors for HLA-B 27 homodimers. CONCLUSION: Patients with <b>spondylarthritis</b> express both HLA-B 27 heavy-chain homodimers and receptors for HLA-B 27 homodimers.

ObjectivesProspective {{evaluation of}} the impact of a patient's education program dedicated to patients affected by ankylosing <b>spondylarthritis.</b> Patients and methodsOne hundred and eighty-six patients were involved in this program between 2007 and 2014. They underwent a mean of 25 sessions of multidisciplinary education. A complete team including physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, dietetitians, chiropodists, psychiatrists, physical medicine and rehabilitation doctors, and rheumatologists conducted this program. It included teaching of auto-exercises by physiotherapists and occupational therapists, relaxation, balneotherapy, gymnastics, information on the disease and its care, including prevention of complications and management of treatment. ResultsOne hundred and forty-five patients (78 %) completed the follow-up 6 months after the program. The average age of the patients is 42 years [17 – 78 years], 51 % were men. Seventy percent carried the gene HLA B 27. The disease evolved for 13. 6 years with a delay diagnostic of 8 years. 62 % of the patients had a professional activity, 19 % were in incapacity. Sixty-two percent were taking non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 45 % were under anti TNF treatment. Among the patients under anti TNF, 84 % made lonely their own injections. 44 % underwent regular physiotherapy, 15 % practised self-rehabilitation. At {{the end of the program}} and at 6 months, 100 % of the patients reported that the program met their needs and expectations. At 6 months, an improvement of the following parameters were observed: BASDAI 0. 93 [5. 4; 4. 1] with P< 0. 001, BASFI 0. 72 [7. 41; 4] with P< 0. 011, EVA disease- 1. 01 [7; 4] with P= 0. 011, EVA pain- 0. 84 [8. 4; 4] with P= 0. 012, stiffness 14. 17 [180; 120] with P< 0. 001, count of pain joints 0. 8 [31; 4] with P= 0. 011.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{performance}} of computed tomography (CT) scanning for ascertaining sacroiliitis in patients with suspected <b>spondylarthritis</b> (SpA). METHODS: The Echography in <b>Spondylarthritis</b> French cohort consists of 489 patients with suspected SpA. At baseline, all patients underwent clinical examination, HLA-B typing, and pelvic radiography. Pelvic CT scanning was performed if sacroiliitis on radiography was considered uncertain or if patients presented with buttock pain duration of > 6 months. A set of 100 paired radiographs and CT scans was read in a blinded manner by 2 radiologists, and the kappa coefficient {{was used to assess}} their interreader reliability. One of the radiologists read the 173 available pairs of radiographs and CT scans performed at baseline. RESULTS: After training, interreader reliability was moderate for sacroiliitis grading on radiographs (κ = 0. 59), excellent on CT scans (κ = 0. 91), and excellent for ascertaining sacroiliitis on both radiographs (κ = 1) and CT scans (κ = 0. 96). The first and second readers considered the quality of imaging to be excellent in 66 % and 67 %, respectively, of the radiographs (κ = 0. 88) and in 93 % and 92 %, respectively, of the CT scans (κ = 0. 93). Concordance between radiographs and CT scans was low for sacroiliitis grading (κ = 0. 08) or ascertainment (κ = 0. 16). Definite sacroiliitis was ascertained on radiographs in 6 patients (3. 5 %) (confirmed by CT scans in 4 patients) and on CT scans in 32 patients (18. 5 %). A history of uveitis was associated with definite sacroiliitis on radiographs (P = 0. 04) and CT scans (P < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Definite sacroiliitis was underestimated by radiography, as compared to CT scanning.

40|$|ABSTRACT Chronic necrotizing {{pulmonary}} aspergillosis (CNPA), a form {{of chronic}} pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), affects immunocompetent or mildly immunocompromised persons with underlying pulmonary disease. These conditions are associated with high morbidity and mortality and often require long-term antifungal treatment. The long-term prognosis for patients with CNPA and the potential complications of CNPA have not been well documented. The {{aim of this study}} was to review published papers that report cases of CNPA complications and to highlight risk factors for development of CNPA. The complications in conjunction associated with CNPA are as follows: pseudomembranous necrotizing tracheobronchial aspergillosis, ankylosing <b>spondylarthritis,</b> pulmonary silicosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease, superinfection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and and pneumothorax. The diagnosis of CNPA is still a challenge. Culture and histologic examinations of bronchoscopically identified tracheobronchial mucus plugs and necrotic material should be performed in all immunocompromised individuals, even when the radiographic findings are unchanged. Early detection of intraluminal growth of Aspergillus and prompt antifungal therapy may facilitate the management of these patients and prevent development of complications...|$|E

Moreover, the paper provides {{a detailed analysis of}} the Bechterew's disease (i. e. the ankylosing spondylitis), its examination, treatment and the application of physiotherapeutic procedures. The practical section depicts physiotherapy applied specifically to treat three randomly chosen patients of the Aurora Spa based in Třeboň, as the treatment was administered between 5 March and 9 April, 2010. The first objective pursued in the paper is the evaluation of some selected methods of physiotherapy used in treatment of the Bechterew's disease patients. In the second objective the paper tries to assess the effect that the methods could have on the disease prognosis. The paper relied on the methods of a qualitative survey, and the data were gathered using these techniques: anamnesis, interview, observation (kinesiologic analysis) and the secondary analysis of data. The paper can do the duty of study and instructional material for students, the lay public and for health-care professionals...|$|E
40|$|The symptom {{intensity}} and mortality of human diseases, conditions, and syndromes exhibit diurnal or 24 h patterning, e. g., skin: atopic dermatitis, urticaria, psoriasis, and palmar hyperhidrosis; gastrointestinal: esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer (including perforation and hemorrhage), cyclic vomiting syndrome, biliary colic, hepatic variceal hemorrhage, and proctalgia fugax; infection: susceptibility, fever, and mortality; neural: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobe seizures, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, hereditary progressive dystonia, and pain (cancer, post-surgical, diabetic neuropathic and foot ulcer, tooth caries, burning mouth and temporomandibular syndromes, fibromyalgia, sciatica, intervertebral vacuum phenomenon, multiple sclerosis muscle spasm, and migraine, tension, cluster, hypnic, and paroxysmal hemicranial headache); renal: colic and nocturnal enuresis and polyuria; ocular: bulbar conjunctival redness, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, intraocular pressure and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and recurrent corneal erosion syndrome; psychiatric/behavioral: major and seasonal affective depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, parasuicide and suicide, dementia-associated agitation, and addictive alcohol, tobacco, and heroin cravings and withdrawal phenomena; plus autoimmune and musculoskeletal: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, axial <b>spondylarthritis,</b> gout, Sjögren's syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Knowledge {{of these and}} other 24 h patterns of human pathophysiology informs research of their underlying circadian and other endogenous mechanisms, external temporal triggers, and more effective patient care entailing clinical chronopreventive and chronotherapeutic strategie...|$|E
40|$|The highly {{effective}} treatment of rheumatoid arthritis by B cell depletion {{and the presence}} of B cells in the peripheral and axial lesions of patients with <b>spondylarthritis</b> (SpA) raise the question as to whether B lymphocytes could also be an appropriate therapeutic target in the latter disease. We describe 2 male HLA-B 27 -positive patients who had active SpA despite absence of B cells. One patient developed SpA with sacroiliitis and asymmetric oligoarthritis after having been diagnosed as having severe Bruton agammaglobulinemia. Since extensive investigations excluded an infectious origin of the SpA, this case illustrates that functional B cells and/or gamma globulins are not strictly required for SpA pathogenesis. The second patient had severe axial and peripheral SpA that was treated successfully with etanercept. After discontinuation of etanercept treatment because of non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma, both axial and peripheral SpA symptoms relapsed rapidly, and this exacerbation of articular disease activity was not modulated by successful B cell depletion therapy for the lymphoma. Although case reports have obvious limitations, our clinical observations provide evidence that active SpA can occur in the absence of functional mature B cells and thus emphasize the need for systematic studies of the exact role and function of B lymphocytes in this diseas...|$|E
