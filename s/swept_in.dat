5|$|Dragonflies become scarce {{at higher}} latitudes. They are not native to Iceland, but {{individuals}} are occasionally <b>swept</b> <b>in</b> by strong winds, including a Hemianax ephippiger native to North Africa, and an unidentified darter species. In Kamchatka, {{only a few}} species of dragonfly including the treeline emerald Somatochlora arctica and some aeshnids such as Aeshna subarctica are found, possibly because of the low temperature of the lakes there. The treeline emerald {{is also found in}} northern Alaska, within the Arctic Circle, making it the most northerly of all dragonflies.|$|E
5|$|Hornsby did {{not become}} a manager or coach again until 1950, when he was hired to manage the Texas League's Beaumont Roughnecks. Beaumont won the pennant, but they were <b>swept</b> <b>in</b> {{the first round of}} the playoffs by the San Antonio Missions. The next year, in 1951, Hornsby managed the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League. Under Hornsby's leadership, the Rainiers won the pennant.|$|E

After failing to win the pennant in 1959, the Braves would not play for a championship again until they moved to Atlanta. They next returned to post-season play in 1969, their fourth season in Atlanta, where they were <b>swept</b> <b>in</b> the League Championship Series. The Braves returned to the World Series again in the 1990s, losing the 1991, 1992, 1996, and 1999 World Series but winning in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The Colorado Rockies {{were created}} as an {{expansion}} franchise in 1993 and Coors Field opened in 1995. The Rockies {{advanced to the}} playoffs that year, but were eliminated in the first round.

5|$|To date, the Cardinals' 11 {{world championships}} {{are the most}} won by any National League team, and rank {{second only to the}} Yankees' 27. The Cardinals' and Yankees' last wins were within two years of each other (having {{occurred}} in 2011 and 2009, respectively). The two teams would meet again in 1928 (which the Yankees <b>swept</b> <b>in</b> four games); 1942 (which the Cardinals won in five games); 1943 (which the Yankees won in five games); and 1964 (which the Cardinals won in seven games).|$|E

5|$|Torres {{was traded}} in the {{off-season}} to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for forward Gilbert Brulé on July 1, 2008. He missed 10 games to begin the 2008–09 campaign with a separated right shoulder. A month later, on December 2, 2008, he underwent surgery for an injured knee and missed an additional 19 games. With an injury-shortened season {{for the second consecutive}} year, he recorded 12 goals and 20 points over 51 games. In the 2009 playoffs, Torres added two assists as Columbus was <b>swept</b> <b>in</b> four games by the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{work began}} on the rock on 7 August 1838. Stevenson and 21 workmen arrived on board the sailing vessel Pharos and began to unload the barrack, whose massive legs were set into holes blasted out of the rock.

5|$|Morrison {{finished}} the 1999–2000 season with nine points in 12 {{games with the}} Canucks for a combined total of 35 points in 56 games. In the off-season, he re-signed with the Canucks. Playing in his first full season with the Canucks in 2000–01, Morrison improved to 54 points (16 goals and 38 assists) over 82 games. He helped the team reach the post-season {{for the first time}} since 1996, as Vancouver secured the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference. Facing the Colorado Avalanche in the first round, the Canucks were <b>swept</b> <b>in</b> four games. Morrison scored his first NHL playoff goal during the series and finished with three points in four games.|$|E

5|$|Predictably, the Giants {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season. They were 2–2 when Taylor returned from his suspension. With Taylor back and playing well, however, they won six out of their next eight games. After two straight losses, the Giants won their next three contests {{to set up a}} win-or-go-home game against the Jets in the season finale. The Jets defeated the Giants 27–21. When the Eagles beat the Cowboys, and the 49ers lost to the Rams later that night, the Eagles won the NFC East and the Rams clinched the final Wild Card berth. The Giants finished {{on the outside looking in}} despite a 10–6 record, because in the tiebreakers, they were <b>swept</b> <b>in</b> the season series by Philadelphia and had a worse conference record than the Rams.|$|E
5|$|The Rockets {{finished}} the 1990–91 {{season with a}} record of 52–30 under NBA Coach of the Year Chaney. Olajuwon averaged 21.8 points per game in 1990–91, but due to an injury to his eyesocket caused by an elbow from Bill Cartwright, did not play in enough games (56) to qualify for the rebounding title. Otherwise he would have won it for a third consecutive year, averaging 13.8 a game (league leader Robinson averaged 13.0 rpg). He also averaged a league-leading 3.95 blocks per game. However, the Rockets were <b>swept</b> <b>in</b> the playoffs by the LA Lakers.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees again {{reached the}} World Series in their 1963 campaign, but were <b>swept</b> <b>in</b> four games by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Houk left the manager's {{position}} {{to become the}} team's general manager and the newly retired Berra was named manager. After dealing with player injuries and internal dissension, the Yankees rallied from third place late in the 1964 season and won the AL pennant by one game over the White Sox. It was their fifth straight World Series appearance and fourteenth in the past sixteen years. The team faced the St. Louis Cardinals in a series that included a walk-off home run by Mantle to end the third game. Despite Mantle's game-winning hit, the Yankees were defeated by the Cardinals in seven games, and Berra was fired.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{necessary}} after both teams finished {{the season with}} identical win–loss records of 89–73. The Rockies won a coin flip late in the season, which awarded them home field for the game. Upon winning, the Rockies advanced to the NL Division Series where they swept the Philadelphia Phillies. After advancing, they swept the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NL Championship Series, winning their first pennant in franchise history. However, the Rockies were, in turn, <b>swept</b> <b>in</b> the 2007 World Series by the Boston Red Sox, ending their season. In baseball statistics the tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular season game for both teams, with all events in the game added to regular season statistics.|$|E
5|$|After debuting {{at number}} {{three on the}} Italian Albums Chart, Laundry Service ascended to number two the {{following}} week but was kept from attaining the top position by Alanis Morissette's 2002 album Under Rug <b>Swept.</b> <b>In</b> Spain, Servicio de Lavanderia reached number two on the PROMUSICAE albums chart. It also charted in 2005 in the country along with Shakira's fifth and sixth studio albums Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 and Oral Fixation, Vol. 2, respectively. The album has been certified quintuple-platinum by PROMUSICAE for shipments of 500,000 units. In Sweden, Laundry Service debuted atop the Sverigetopplistan chart and stayed on the top position for three weeks. It was certified double platinum by IFPI Sweden in 2003. In Switzerland, the album entered the Schweizer Hitparade chart at number 81 and peaked at number one, spending a total of 84 weeks on the chart. Laundry Service was later certified quintuple-platinum by the IFPI for selling 200,000 units in Switzerland. In the United Kingdom, Laundry Service debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart. It later peaked at number two. The album was certified double-platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 600,000 copies. By 2002, Laundry Service had sold more than four million copies in Europe alone and thus was certified quadruple-platinum by IFPI Europe.|$|E
5|$|After the hot start, a {{prolonged}} slump through January and February occurred {{during which the}} Senators won only seven of 21 games, and Murray fired Head Coach Paddock and Assistant Coach Ron Low on February 27, 2008, taking over the coaching duties himself. After the coaching switch, team performance improved but did not match {{the performance of the}} beginning of the season. A playoff spot was in doubt until the Senators' last game of the season, a loss to Boston, but the team qualified due to the Carolina Hurricanes losing. After all other games were played, the team ended up as the seventh seed and faced the Pittsburgh Penguins in the opening round, a repeat of the 2007 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. The Senators lost the series four games to none, the third time they were <b>swept</b> <b>in</b> a first-round series. The result, after going to the Finals the previous season, led to speculation by the media that the team would make a large change in personnel before next season, including the buy-out of Ray Emery and the Senators not re-signing their free agents.|$|E

5|$|For {{the sixth}} {{time in his}} major league career, Doby was named an All-Star during the 1954 season, one of five Indians named. The game was held at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium and {{featured}} the second-largest crowd to watch an All-Star Game (the largest was in 1935 at the same stadium). In what would prove his final career All-Star at bat, Doby hit a pinch-hit solo {{home run in the}} eighth inning to tie the game at 9–9; the AL squad went on to win, 11–9. His home run was the first hit by a black player in an All-Star Game. The game, which had a record 17 hits by the AL and was the highest-scoring All-Star Game until 1998, was called the best ever by All-Star Game founder Arch Ward. As the regular season resumed, Doby helped the Indians to win a franchise-record 111 games and the AL pennant. His regular season 32 home runs and career-high 126 RBIs were highest in the AL, which led to him finishing second in AL MVP voting. The Indians were <b>swept</b> <b>in</b> the 1954 World Series by Doby's former Eagles teammate Monte Irvin and the New York Giants.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} Breslin joined the Chicago Cheetahs of the Roller Hockey International (RHI) league for the 1994 season. Playing in just 6 games, Breslin {{recorded}} 5 goals and 13 points. Prior {{to the start}} of the 1994–95 IHL season, Breslin signed a one-year contract with the Chicago Wolves. He was one of the first three players signed by the Wolves who began their first season as an IHL expansion team. In his first season with the Wolves, Breslin notched 7 goals and 28 points. Chicago finished with 80 points—good enough for third in their division and to qualify for the playoffs. Facing the Kalamazoo Wings in the first round, Chicago was <b>swept</b> <b>in</b> three straight games. Playing in his first professional playoffs, Breslin contributed two points playing in all three games. In the off-season Breslin negotiated his own contract to stay in Chicago, signing a two-year deal. Over the next two seasons, Breslin averaged 56 games played a season due to knee and shoulder injuries. As a team the Wolves qualified for the playoffs in both seasons but failed to advance beyond the second round. At the conclusion of the 1996–97 season, Breslin was awarded the I. John Snider trophy as IHL Man of the Year, an award given to recognize outstanding community service.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, 2016, Turner {{signed a}} four-year, $70 million {{contract}} with the Portland Trail Blazers. Turner battled Maurice Harkless for the starting small forward role through the preseason, {{but in the end}} he lost out. He debuted with a 3-point, 5-rebound and 5-assist performance in a 113–104 win over the Utah Jazz in 26 minutes off the bench. With Harkless injured on December 8, Turner started against the Memphis Grizzlies and notched a 15-point, 10-rebound double-double in a 8886 loss, despite a pair of go-ahead free throws by Turner with 27 seconds left. On January 5, 2017, he scored 15 of his season-high 20 points {{in the fourth quarter of}} the Trail Blazers' 118–109 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. Turner's 11 assists off the bench on January 11 against the Cleveland Cavaliers was the most by a Portland reserve in nearly 3 years. On February 8, he was ruled out for approximately five to six weeks after sustaining a fracture of the third metacarpal in his right hand the night before playing against the Dallas Mavericks. He returned to action, wearing a protective brace, on March 18 after missing 14 games. The team was 77 without Turner. He opened the 2017 NBA playoffs with a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double in a 12-point loss to the Golden State Warriors. The Trail Blazers were <b>swept</b> <b>in</b> four games, however.|$|E
