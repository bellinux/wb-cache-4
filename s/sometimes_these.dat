5|$|The feature {{responsible}} for the brittle fruitbody structure in the mushroom-forming species are globular cells, called sphaerocytes or sphaerocysts, that compose the flesh (trama) alongside the usual hyphae. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>these</b> cells are clustered, and the position and arrangement of these clusters differs among genera.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{isolated}} coastal location, the Isle of Portland has {{an extensive}} range of flora and fauna; the coastline and disused quarries are designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Sea and migratory birds occupy the cliffs in different seasons, <b>sometimes</b> <b>these</b> include rare species which draw ornithologists {{from around the}} country. Rare visitors to the surrounding seas include dolphins, seals and basking sharks. Chesil Beach {{is one of only}} two sites in Britain where the scaly cricket can be found; unlike any other cricket it is wingless and does not sing or hop. Ten British Primitive goats were introduced to the East Weares part of the island to control scrub in 2007.|$|E

5|$|In West Africa, {{the sons}} and daughters of Yoruba kings were {{traditionally}} given in marriage to their fellow royals as a matter of dynastic policy. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>these</b> marriages would involve members of other tribes. Erinwinde of Benin, for example, was taken as a wife by the Oba Oranyan of Oyo during his time as governor of Benin. Their son Eweka went on to give birth to the dynasty that rules the Kingdom of Benin today.|$|E
5|$|Since {{birds are}} highly visible and common animals, humans {{have had a}} {{relationship}} with them since the dawn of man. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>these</b> relationships are mutualistic, like the cooperative honey-gathering among honeyguides and African peoples such as the Borana. Other times, they may be commensal, as when species such as the house sparrow have benefited from human activities. Several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pests, and some pose an aviation hazard. Human activities can also be detrimental, and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction (hunting, avian lead poisoning, pesticides, roadkill, wind turbine kills and predation by pet cats and dogs are common sources of death for birds).|$|E
5|$|The diet of the Arctic tern varies {{depending}} on location and time, but is usually carnivorous. In most cases, it eats small fish or marine crustaceans. Fish species comprise {{the most important part}} of the diet, and account for more of the biomass consumed than any other food. Prey species are immature (1–2-year old) shoaling species such as herring, cod, sandlances, and capelin. Among the marine crustaceans eaten are amphipods, crabs and krill. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>these</b> birds also eat molluscs, marine worms, or berries, and on their northern breeding grounds, insects.|$|E

5|$|The {{rulers of}} the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650BC) {{continued}} building pyramids and their associated complexes. The rare remains from Middle Kingdom temples, {{like the one at}} Medinet Madi, show that temple plans grew more symmetrical during that period, and divine temples made increasing use of stone. The pattern of a sanctuary lying behind a pillared hall frequently appears in Middle Kingdom temples, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>these</b> two elements are fronted by open courts, foreshadowing the standard temple layout used in later times.|$|E
5|$|Warcraft: Orcs & Humans is a {{real-time}} strategy game (RTS). The player {{takes the}} role of either the Human inhabitants of Azeroth, or the invading Orcs. In the single player campaign mode the player works {{through a series of}} missions, the objective of which varies, but usually involves building a small town, harvesting resources, building an army and then leading it to victory. In multiplayer games, the objective is always to destroy the enemy players' forces. Some scenarios are complicated by the presence of wild monsters, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>these</b> monsters can be used as troops. The game plays in a medieval setting with fantasy elements. Both sides have melee units and ranged units, and also spellcasters.|$|E
5|$|During the Anglo-Saxon period, many shrines {{were built}} on former pagan sites which became popular pilgrimage destinations, while other pilgrims visited {{prominent}} monasteries and sites of learning. Senior nobles or kings would travel to Rome, {{which was a}} popular destination from the 7th century onwards; <b>sometimes</b> <b>these</b> trips were a form of convenient political exile. Under the Normans, religious institutions with important shrines, such as Glastonbury, Canterbury and Winchester, promoted themselves as pilgrimage destinations, maximising {{the value of the}} historic miracles associated with the sites. Accumulating relics became an important task for ambitious institutions, as these were believed to hold curative powers and lent status to the site. Indeed, by the 12th century reports of posthumous miracles by local saints were becoming increasing common in England, adding to the attractiveness of pilgrimages to prominent relics.|$|E

5|$|Locomotor {{behavior}} in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids. Locomotor postures and behaviors have included vertical clinging and leaping (including saltatory behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs; slow (loris-like) arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by Mesopropithecus; fast arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs; partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, {{seen in the}} ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by monkey lemurs such as Hadropithecus; and sloth-like suspensory locomotion, once exhibited {{by many of the}} sloth lemurs, such as Palaeopropithecus. The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) has even been reported to be a good swimmer. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>these</b> locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the Palladian country house {{in the seventeenth century}} separated the family of the householder from the servants. Previously sharing the hall, and bedding down at a master's feet, or door, servants were now given separate small chambers. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>these</b> were placed on a mezzanine floor, as at Kinross. Servants were less visible, using backstairs that kept them away from members of the family and guests and they fulfilled necessary and sometimes unpleasant tasks. They were also fewer in number, of lower social status and predominately female. A country house could have 10 to 20 servants and large houses had more. A hierarchy of positions developed from the butler and housekeeper to footmen and maids. The sexes were increasingly segregated into their own quarters.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} Chicago school produced large, solid-looking skyscrapers, {{built with}} a common appearance and to a common height. The result was usually a box-like palazzo, illuminated with a large light court, ideally, if space allowed, in the center. The outside of the building was commonly divided into three parts: a base, middle section and the roof line. This tripartite design was intended both to emulate classical columns, and reflect {{the functions of the}} different parts of the skyscraper. The central court could form a simple courtyard, but many companies preferred to roof over the courtyard with glass to produce an atrium for shops and restaurants. Rents for these shops were up to five or six times that for office space, and made an important difference to the income from a property. Chicago skyscraper windows were also a feature of the style; these were large, fixed windows flanked by smaller sash windows on either side, which provided access to sunlight and adequate ventilation. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>these</b> protruded from the building to form a slight bay.|$|E

5|$|Ants of this genus {{prefer to}} inhabit grasslands, forests, heath, urban areas and {{woodland}}. Nests {{are found in}} Callitris forest, dry marri forest, Eucalyptus woodland and forests, mallee scrub, in paddocks, riparian woodland, and wet and dry sclerophyll forests. They also live in dry sandplains, and coastal plain. When a queen establishes a new colony, the nest is at first quite simple structurally. The nest gradually expands as the colony grows larger. Nests {{can be found in}} debris, decaying tree stumps, rotten logs, rocks, sand, and soil, and under stones. While most species nest underground, M. mjobergi is an arboreal nesting species found on epiphytic ferns of the genus Platycerium. Two types of nests have been described for this genus: a simple nest with a noticeable shaft inside, and a complex structure surrounded by a mound. Some species construct dome-shaped mounds containing a single entrance, but some nests have numerous holes that are constantly used and can extend several metres underground. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>these</b> mounds can be 0.5 m (20in) high. Workers decorate these nests with a variety of items, including charcoal, leaves, plant fragments, pebbles, and twigs. Some ants use the warmth by decorating their nests with dry materials that heat quickly, providing the nest with solar energy traps.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{majority}} of specimens are almost or even totally black, (with the exception of head and facial markings), the color pattern may consist of a brown, gray, tan, yellowish-olive, or blackish ground color, which is overlaid {{with a series of}} 10–17 dark brown to almost black crossbands. These crossbands, which usually have black edges, are sometimes broken along the dorsal midline to form a series of staggered halfbands {{on either side of the}} body. These crossbands are visibly lighter in the center, almost matching the ground color, often contain irregular dark markings, and extend well down onto the ventral scales. The dorsal banding pattern fades with age, so older individuals are an almost uniform olive-brown, grayish-brown, or black. The belly is white, yellowish-white, or tan, marked with dark spots, and becomes darker posteriorly. The amount of dark pigment on the belly varies from virtually none to almost completely black. The head is a more or less uniform brown color, especially in A. p. piscivorus. Subadult specimens may exhibit the same kind of dark, parietal spots characteristic of A. contortrix, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>these</b> are still visible in adults. Eastern populations have a broad, dark, postocular stripe, bordered with pale pigment above and below, that is faint or absent in western populations. The underside of the head is generally whitish, cream, or tan.|$|E
