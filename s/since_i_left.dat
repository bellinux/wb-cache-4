5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>Left</b> You is {{the debut}} studio album by Australian {{electronic}} music group the Avalanches, released on 27 November 2000. It was issued on Modular Recordings and {{produced by the}} Avalanches' members Robbie Chater and Darren Seltmann (under the pseudonym Bobbydazzler). The album uses sampling extensively, containing an estimated 3,500 samples from various genres of music. The album was created in two separate near-identical studios by Chater and Seltmann, exchanging audio mixes of records they sampled.|$|E

5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>Left</b> You is {{the debut}} studio album by the Avalanches. They started {{recording}} in 1999 and {{had used the}} working title of Pablo's Cruise. The duo primarily worked with a Yamaha Promix 01 and Akai S2000 samplers. The band's members, Darren Seltmann and Robbie Chater, spent hours sampling music from vinyl records to create the songs on the album: Chater estimates that there are over 3,500 samples. After sampling and arranging, the pair would swap their tapes, listen to each other's ideas and expand on whatever they had heard. Despite working separately, both Chater and Seltmann had nearly identical studio set-ups.|$|E
5|$|To promote <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>Left</b> You the Avalanches {{organised}} {{their first}} Australian head-lining tour in October 2000 planning {{to head to}} all the capital cities. All dates on the tour were sold out. In their Brisbane show, Seltmann broke his leg in an on-stage collision with bass guitarist and singer, Tony Di Blasi. In January–February 2001, the Avalanches toured with the Big Day Out festival in Australia, visiting four capital cities. While on tour in Europe, Seltmann broke his other leg, thereafter {{the rest of the}} tour's shows were DJ sets. The British dance music magazine Muzik awarded the Avalanches as best live act.|$|E
5|$|Wildflower is {{the second}} studio album {{recorded}} by Australian electronic music group the Avalanches. It was first released for streaming on Apple Music on 1 July 2016, and saw a full release a week later on 8 July. It was issued through Modular Recordings, Astralwerks, XL Recordings, and EMI. Production of the album was led by Robbie Chater with assistance from Tony Di Blasi and lasted nearly 16 years, commencing shortly {{after the release of}} their debut album, <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>Left</b> You, in November 2000 and not concluding until March 2016. The album features multiple guest collaborators providing vocals and live instrumentation across its 21 tracks. Wildflower also features extensive sampling, especially from 1960s psychedelic music, and relates to the era through themes of counterculture and anti-establishment. Chater described the album's structure as a road trip from a hyperrealistic urban environment to somewhere remote and far away while on LSD.|$|E

[...] Q listed it {{as one of the best}} 50 albums of 2001. The album was voted the 11th best album of the year in The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop critics poll for 2001.

500|$|As <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>Left</b> You {{was being}} recorded, the Avalanches had trouble {{choosing}} songs {{to be released}} as singles, finding them not sounding as good outside {{the context of the}} album. On 13 September 1999 they issued [...] "Electricity" [...] as a four-track 12" [...] vinyl single in Australia (on Modular Recordings) and as a two-track 7" [...] vinyl single in the United Kingdom (on Rex Records). – The Avalanches}} – The Avalanches}} Chater felt that Modular was very patient with the group releasing the record. On 21 August 2000, the next single for the album was [...] "Frontier Psychiatrist" [...] which was issued by Modular in Australia in both a four-track and two-track version. The initial release date for <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>Left</b> You was going to be 11 September; however, it was delayed due to issues with sample clearance. On 27 November the album was issued in Australia with plans to have a world release in early 2001. The later release date outside Australia was due to additional sample clearances needed for international markets. To celebrate the album's release in Melbourne, the group had a boat cruise party through Port Phillip Bay. In February 2001 they released the album's title track in Australia and followed in July 2001 with [...] "Radio".|$|E
500|$|Wildflower was {{produced}} {{over the course}} of 16 years. The track [...] "Saturday Night Inside Out" [...] was originally from a mixtape in 2000 and was the first song Chater made after <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>Left</b> You. Production for the album was not completed until March 2016. The Avalanches became more serious about building a second album around 2011–13 and booked studio time to commit themselves to the project. Until about 2014, Chater was using a Power Macintosh G3 beige with System 7 for Studio Vision, a sequencing program that ended support in 1997. The group had to max out credit cards to help finance production.|$|E

60|$|The moment I {{entered the}} room I saw that some one had been there <b>since</b> <b>I</b> had <b>left.</b> A silk lay upon the floor. It {{had not been there}} before.

500|$|All former Avalanches members, {{with the}} {{exception}} of Chater and Di Blasi, had left the group by 2014. Darren Seltmann, one of the co-founders and co-producers on <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>Left</b> You, had left the group around 2006 to focus on raising a family. In regard to the band's second album, Modular stated in February 2014, [...] "Album sounds awesome, but there's no dates or anything planned. The official line is 'stay tuned.'" [...] In June 2014, Jennifer Herrema mentioned Chater had wrote to her stating [...] "their album was gonna be done in three weeks". The band's official Facebook page was later updated in 2015, listing James Dela Cruz {{as a member of the}} band once again.|$|E
500|$|Teasing of {{the album}} began in April 2016, and it was {{formally}} announced in June alongside the release of its first single, an extended mix of [...] "Frankie Sinatra" [...] (2016). Upon release, Wildflower received critical acclaim. Critics praised the production {{of the album}} although most compared it less favourably to <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>Left</b> You. The record also experienced commercial success; it reached number one in the band's native Australia and the top 10 in the United Kingdom. The Avalanches had to leave out many tracks which did not fit with the theme of the album, including some written with guest collaborators. They plan to release these songs [...] "within a year" [...] of the album's release in order to provide a start to produce new material.|$|E
500|$|Wildflower is a plunderphonics album; every {{track on}} the record is sample-based, similar to <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>Left</b> You. The album has also been {{described}} as featuring electronic music, neo-psychedelia, disco, and hip hop throughout. When asked if Wildflower has more than the estimated 3,500 samples on the former record, Chater stated [...] "I’ve got no idea...there’s probably more. It’s so fragmented. Every little footstep and voice and yell and clatter and cowhorn and dog barking, it’s just ridiculous." [...] The group had been clearing samples starting in 2011-12, but would occasionally need to re-negotiate when owners of the source material discovered who the Avalanches were and would request more money. The sample clearance was done by Pat Shannahan in Los Angeles, who also cleared the samples for <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>Left</b> You. The track [...] "Subways" [...] features vocals sampled from a 1980 track {{of the same name}} sung by then 12-year-old post punk artist Chandra off her EP Transportation. Chandra had not heard of the Avalanches until they approached her in early 2014 for permission to sample the track, but has since become a fan of their work. The most difficult sample to clear was of a choir from Kew High School in Melbourne singing [...] "Come Together" [...] by The Beatles on the track [...] "The Noisy Eater". Initially their request was refused, but Chater and Di Blasi made contact with Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono directly through [...] "friends of friends". They sent them the track along with a letter written by Tony explaining their process and in return were granted approval. The song would have not been added to Wildflower if the sample could not be cleared.|$|E
60|$|It was odd {{to wake up}} {{and realize}} that I was in London. Years seemed to have passed <b>since</b> <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> it.
