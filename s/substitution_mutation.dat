50|$|In humans, a <b>substitution</b> <b>mutation</b> at the C-terminal {{region of}} perlipin 2 {{was shown to}} affect both the {{structure}} and function of the protein. At 251 position , serine residue was substituted by proline which results in the disruption of predicted alpha helical structure of the protein as well as reduction in the plasma triglycerides and lipolysis.

50|$|A {{heterozygous}} {{missense mutation}} in the HK1 gene (a change at position 847 from glutamate to lysine) {{has been linked}} to retinitis pigmentosa. Since this <b>substitution</b> <b>mutation</b> is located far from known functional sites and does not impair the enzyme’s glycolytic activity, {{it is likely that the}} mutation acts through another biological mechanism unique to the retina. Notably, studies in mouse retina reveal interactions between Hk1, the mitochondrial metallochaperone Cox11, and the chaperone protein Ranbp2, which serve to maintain normal metabolism and function in the retina. Thus, the mutation may disrupt these interactions and lead to retinal degradation. Alternatively, this mutation may act through the enzyme’s anti-apoptotic function, as disrupting the regulation of the hexokinase-mitochondria association by insulin receptors could trigger photoreceptor apoptosis and retinal degeneration. In this case, treatments that preserve the hexokinase-mitochondria association may serve as a potential therapeutic approach.|$|E
50|$|The Dibucaine {{number is}} used to {{differentiate}} individuals who have substitution mutations of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme resulting in decreased enzyme function. At least one <b>substitution</b> <b>mutation</b> has been characterized {{that is capable of}} altering the efficiency of enzymatic catalysis. Reduced butyrylcholinesterase activity may occur as a result of inherited or acquired causes. Inherited reductions in butyrylcholinesterase activity occur because of mutations at a single autosomal location on the long arm of chromosome 3. Physiologic reductions may occur with extremes of age and during pregnancy. Other acquired causes of decreased activity include kidney and liver disease, malignancy (cancer), malnutrition, and burns. In the inherited type, an individual receives a gene from each parent, one of which may be the wild type butyrylcholinesterase, or the mutant. Thus, there may be individuals who are homozygous for the wild type butyrylcholinesterase (normal) or the mutant butyrylcholinesterase (incidence 1/3200), and there is the group of heterozygotes with one of each (incidence 1/480).|$|E

50|$|When a {{compound}} is suspected to be mutagenic/carcinogenic an Ames test {{is used to}} test this. It uses histidine-requiring yeast strains or bacteria. The strains have been altered with a mutation in a gene important for histidine production, so they require histidine for growth. The cells are grown on a histidine rich medium and are then transferred to a medium that lacks histidine and contains the potential mutagenic substance. If the mutagenic substance causes mutations, {{there is a very}} small chance that another mutation occurs in the histidine gene which again enables the production of histidine. These cells are then able to grow on the medium lacking histidine. The mutagenicity of {{a compound}} is calculated by the number of yeast colonies which are reverted to the histidine-independent form. In one study, the Ames test was executed with benzocfluorene. Two different strains were used, TA100 and TA98. One group of each strain had a rat liver fraction and one group did not. The difference between the TA100 and the TA98 strain is that the TA98 strain has a frameshift mutation, and the TA100 has a base <b>substitution</b> <b>mutation.</b> When the amount of benzocfluorene is increased in TA 100 yeast strain, the amount of revertants per plate does not increase. Only in the TA98 strain plate, which contained a fraction of a rat liver, a higher dose of benzocfluorene seems to correspond with a larger amount of revertants. This indicates that benzocfluorene is metabolized by enzymes in the rat liver into more potent mutagenic compounds. These compounds only affected the TA98 strain. This indicates that the adducts formed by benzocfluorene metabolites cause frameshift mutations, and not point mutations.|$|E

A differential effect of the medium was not observed when these dnaE mutations were combined with a mismatch repair mutation. The selection scheme for the dnaE mutations required that {{they be able to}} complement a temperature-sensitive strain. However, the ability to complement is not related to the mutator effect for {{at least one of the}} mutants. Comparison of the mutation rates for frameshift and base <b>substitution</b> <b>mutations</b> in mutS and dnaE mutS strains suggests that the mismatch repair proteins respond differently to the two types of change. Deletion of dinB from both chromosome and plasmid resulted in a four- to fivefold decrease in the rate of frameshift and base <b>substitution</b> <b>mutations</b> in a dnaE mutS double mutant background. This reduction indicates that most mistakes in replication occur as a result of the action of the auxiliary rather than the replicative polymerase in this dnaE mutant. Deletion of dinB from strains carrying a wild-type dnaE had a measurable effect, suggesting that a fraction of spontaneous mutations occur as a result of dinB polymerase action even in cells with a normal replicative polymerase...|$|R

40|$|Chk 2 is a {{critical}} regulator of the cellular DNA damage repair response. Activation of Chk 2 in response to IR-induced damage is initiated by phosphorylation of the Chk 2 SQ/TQ cluster domain at Ser 19, Ser 33, Ser 35, and Thr 68. This precedes autophosphorylation of Thr 383 /Thr 387 in the T-loop region of the kinase domain an event that {{is a prerequisite for}} efficient kinase activity. We conducted an in-depth analysis of phosphorylation within the T-loop region (residues 366 – 406). We report four novel phosphorylation sites at Ser 372, Thr 378, Thr 389, and Tyr 390. <b>Substitution</b> <b>mutation</b> Y 390 F was defective for kinase function. The <b>substitution</b> <b>mutation</b> T 378 A ablated the IR induction of kinase activity. Interestingly, the <b>substitution</b> <b>mutation</b> T 389 A demonstrated a 6 -fold increase in kinase activity when compared with wild-type Chk 2. In addition, phosphorylation at Thr 389 was a prerequisite to phosphorylation at Thr 387 but not at Thr 383. Quantitative mass spectrometry analysis revealed IR-induced phosphorylation and subcellular distribution of Chk 2 phosphorylated species. We observed IR-induced increase in phosphorylation at Ser 379, Thr 389, and Thr 383 /Thr 389. Phosphorylation at Tyr 390 was dramatically reduced following IR. Exposure to IR was also associated with changes in the ratio of chromatin/nuclear localization. IR-induced increase in chromatin localization was associated with phosphorylation at Thr 372, Thr 379, Thr 383, Thr 389, Thr 383 /Thr 387, and Thr 383 /Thr 389. Chk 2 hyper-phosphorylated species at Thr 383 /Thr 387 /Thr 389 and Thr 383 /Thr 387 /Thr 389 /Tyr 390 relocalized from almost exclusively chromatin to predominately nuclear expression, suggesting a role for phosphorylation in regulation of chromatin targeting and egress. The differential impact of T-loop phosphorylation on Chk 2 ubiquitylation suggests a co-dependence of these modifications. The results demonstrate that a complex interdependent network of phosphorylation events within the T-loop exchange region regulates dimerization/autophosphorylation, kinase activation, and chromatin targeting/egress of Chk 2...|$|E

It has been proposed that apoA-I may be necessary for PON’s association with plasma HDL. On the basis of this, we examined the effect of apoA-I on PON’s enzymatic activity {{and its ability to}} associate with HDL. Additionally, we examined whether changes in apoA-I primary structure (cysteine <b>substitution</b> <b>mutations)</b> could modulate these effects. Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with human PON 1 A cDNA were incubated in the presence and absence of recombinant wild-type apoA-I (apoA-IWT) and specific Cys <b>substitution</b> <b>mutations.</b> Extracellular accumulation of PON activity in the presence of apoA-IWT was 0. 095 (0. 013 unit/mg of cell protein (n) 7) compared to 0. 034 (0. 010 unit/mg of cell protein in the absence of apoA-I (n) 7), a 2. 79 -fold increase in activity when apoA-I was incubated with the cells. Lipid-free apoA-I did not increase PON activity, while preformed nascent HDL increased PON activity only 30 %, suggesting that maximal PON activity is lipid-dependent and requires coassembly of PON and apoA-I on nascent HDL.
