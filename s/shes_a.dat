But {{when it came}} to {{the point}} I couldnt bear to hurt her feelings. <b>Shes</b> <b>a</b> sensitive, affectionate, anxious soul; and she was never brought up to know what freedom is to some people. You see, family life is all the life she knows: she's like a bird born in a cage, that would die if you let it loose in the woods. When I thought how little it was to a man of my easy temper to put up with her, and how deep it would hurt her to think it was because I didnt care for her, I always put off running away till next time; and so in the end I never ran away at all. I daresay it was good for me to be took such care of; but it cut me off from all my old friends {{something}} dreadful, maam: especially the women, maam. She never gave them a chance: she didnt indeed. She never understood that married people should take holidays from one another if they are to keep at all fresh. Not that I ever got tired of her, maam; but my! how I used to get tired of home life sometimes. I used to catch myself envying my brother George: I positively did, maam.|$|E

40|$|This article {{introduces}} planar shape signatures {{derived from}} homology nerves, which are intersecting 1 -cycles {{in a collection}} of homology groups endowed with a proximal relator (set of nearness relations) that includes a descriptive proximity. A 1 -cycle is a closed, connected path with a zero boundary in a simplicial complex covering a finite, bounded planar shape. The signature of <b>a</b> shape <b>sh</b> <b>A</b> (denoted by sig(sh A)) is a feature vector that describes <b>sh</b> <b>A.</b> A signature sig(sh A) is derived from the geometry, homology nerves, Betti number, and descriptive CW topology on the shape <b>sh</b> <b>A.</b> Several main results are given, namely, (a) every finite, bounded planar shape has a signature derived from the homology group on the shape, (b) a homology group equipped with a proximal relator defines a descriptive Leader uniform topology and (c) a description of a homology nerve and union of the descriptions of the 1 -cycles in the nerve have same homotopy type.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the existence and}} levels of <b>sH</b> 2 <b>a,</b> a soluble secreted form of the asialoglycoprotein receptor in human serum. METHODS: Production of recombinant <b>sH</b> 2 <b>a</b> and development of a monoclonal antibody and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). This assay {{was used to determine}} the presence and concentration of <b>sH</b> 2 <b>a</b> in human sera of individuals of both sexes and a wide range of ages. RESULTS: The recombinant protein was produced successfully and a specific ELISA assay was developed. The levels of <b>sH</b> 2 <b>a</b> in sera from 62 healthy individuals varied minimally (147 1; 19 ng/mL). In contrast, 5 hepatitis C patients with cirrhosis showed much decreased <b>sH</b> 2 <b>a</b> levels (50 1; 9 ng/mL). CONCLUSION: Constant <b>sH</b> 2 <b>a</b> levels suggest constitutive secretion from hepatocytes in healthy individuals. This constant level and the decrease with cirrhosis suggest a diagnostic potential...|$|R

40|$|Intersectin- 1 s (ITSN- 1 s), a five Src {{homology}} 3 (SH 3) domain-containing protein, {{is critically}} required for caveolae and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), {{due to its}} interactions with dynamin (dyn). Of the five SH 3 A-E domains, <b>SH</b> 3 <b>A</b> is unique because of its high affinity for dyn and potent inhibition of CME. However, the molecular mechanism by which <b>SH</b> 3 <b>A</b> integrates in the overall function of ITSN- 1 s to regulate the endocytic process is not understood. Using biochemical and functional approaches as well as high-resolution electron microscopy, we show that <b>SH</b> 3 <b>A</b> exogenously expressed in human lung endothelial cells caused abnormal endocytic structures, distorted caveolae clusters, frequent staining-dense rings around the caveolar necks and 60 % inhibition of caveolae internalization. In vitro studies further revealed that <b>SH</b> 3 <b>A,</b> similar to full-length ITSN- 1 s stimulates dyn 2 oligomerization and guanosine triphosphatase (GTP) ase activity, effects not detected when other SH 3 domains of ITSN- 1 s were used as controls. Strikingly, {{in the presence of}} <b>SH</b> 3 <b>A,</b> dyn 2 –dyn 2 interactions are stabilized and despite continuous GTP hydrolysis, dyn 2 oligomers cannot disassemble. <b>SH</b> 3 <b>A</b> may hold up caveolae release from the plasma membrane and formation of free-transport vesicles, by prolonging the lifetime of assembled dyn 2. Altogether, our results indicate that ITSN- 1 s, via its <b>SH</b> 3 <b>A</b> has the unique ability to regulate dyn 2 assembly–disassembly and function during endocytosis...|$|R
