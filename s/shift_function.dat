30|$|The {{different}} regulatory {{scenarios are}} implemented by adapting the lower and {{upper price limit}} of the agents’ pricing strategy according to the regulatory scenario (cf. Table  1). The interaction scenarios are realized through enabling (disabling) the pricing and DR <b>shifting</b> <b>functions</b> for the agents according to the targeted interaction scenario. For the base scenario, neither the pricing function nor the DR <b>shifting</b> <b>function</b> are enabled. The trading scenario activates the pricing function. The trading and DR scenario activate both, the pricing and the DR <b>shifting</b> <b>function.</b> For the upper bound scenario, DR shifting is activated, and pricing is enforced. The enforcement of pricing hereby means, that agent bids (offers) are enforced {{to be at the}} maximum (minimum) price limit for each agent. This results in the highest amount of trading that is feasible. We evaluate completed simulation runs over one year with the respective KPIs introduced in section “Key performance indicators”. The KPIs are calculated directly in AnyLogic by an implemented evaluation function.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a Boyer–Moore-type algorithm for regular expression pattern matching, answering an open problem posed by Aho in 1980 (Pattern Matching in Strings, Academic Press, New York, 1980, p. 342). The new algorithm handles patterns specified by regular expressions—a generalization of the Boyer–Moore and Commentz-Walter algorithms. Like the Boyer–Moore and Commentz-Walter algorithms, the new algorithm {{makes use of}} <b>shift</b> <b>functions</b> which can be precomputed and tabulated. The precomputation algorithms are derived, and it is shown that the required <b>shift</b> <b>functions</b> can be precomputed from Commentz-Walter's d 1 and d 2 <b>shift</b> <b>functions.</b> In certain cases, the Boyer–Moore (respectively Commentz-Walter) algorithm has greatly outperformed the Knuth–Morris–Pratt (respectively Aho–Corasick) algorithm (as discussed by Watson in his Ph. D. Thesis, Eindhoven University of Technology, September 1995, and in: N. Ziviani, R. Baeza-Yates, K. Guimaraes (Eds.), Proc. Third South American Workshop on String Processing, International Informatics Series, vol. 4, Carleton University Press, Recife, Brazil, 1996, pp. 280 – 294).

40|$|AbstractA natural {{question}} about linear operators on the Hilbert–Hardy space is answered, motivated by work in geophysical imaging. Namely, which bounded linear operators on the Hardy space preserve {{the set of}} all <b>shifted</b> outer <b>functions?</b> A complete characterization is determined, which allows an explicit construction of all such operators. Every operator that preserves the set of <b>shifted</b> outer <b>functions</b> is necessarily a product-composition operator, consisting of composition with a <b>shifted</b> outer <b>function</b> followed by multiplication with a (possibly different) <b>shifted</b> outer <b>function.</b> Such operators represent important physical processes, including the propagation of seismic wave energy through the earth.

The higher order spectral <b>shift</b> <b>functions</b> represent the remainders of higher order Taylor-type approximations; they can be expressed recursively via the lower order (in particular, Krein’s and Koplienko’s) ones. We also obtain higher order spectral averaging formulas generalizing the Birman-Solomyak spectral averaging formula.

50|$|The {{committee}} {{debated the}} possibility of a <b>shift</b> <b>function</b> (like in ITA2), which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a six-bit code. In a shifted code, some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes. It allows compact encoding, but is less reliable for data transmission, as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable. The standards committee decided against shifting, and so ASCII required at least a seven-bit code.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{solution for}} the heat transfer in hollow cylinders with time-dependent boundary condition and time-dependent heat transfer coefficient at different surfaces is developed for the first time. The methodology {{is an extension of}} the <b>shifting</b> <b>function</b> method.

The transformed system is thus solved by series expansion theorem. Limiting cases of the solution are studied and numerical results are compared with those in the literature. The convergence rate of the present solution is fast and the analytical solution is simple and accurate. Also, the influence of physical parameters on the temperature distribution of a hollow cylinder along the radial direction is investigated...|$|R
