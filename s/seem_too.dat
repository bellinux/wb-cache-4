5|$|During {{development}} {{there was}} a concern that the game might initially <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> complicated. At {{the end of the}} videotape there is a special fifteen-minute presentation called the rules presentation in which a voice-over along with the Gatekeeper explains the game, the characters and how to play. The rules presentation was created to help explain the game to new players. The videotape can be forwarded {{to the start of the}} instructions. During the rules presentation a game is played by actors who are dressed as three Harbingers – Baron Samedi, Anne de Chantraine and Elizabeth Bathory – and three Soul Rangers. The demonstration game is used throughout the rules presentation to help explain how to play the game.|$|E
5|$|Before Romney took over, {{the event}} was $379million short of its revenue goals. Officials had made plans to scale back the Games to {{compensate}} for the fiscal crisis, and there were fears it might be moved away entirely. In addition, the image of the Games had been damaged by allegations of bribery against top officials including prior committee president and CEO Frank Joklik. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee forced Joklik and committee vice president Dave Johnson to resign. Utah power brokers, including Governor Mike Leavitt, searched for someone with a scandal-free reputation to take charge of the Olympics. They chose Romney based on his business and legal expertise as well as his connections to both the LDS Church and the state. The appointment faced some initial criticism from both non-Mormons and Mormons that it represented cronyism and made the Games <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> Mormon-dominated.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, the Enriques–Kodaira {{classification}} is {{a classification}} of compact complex surfaces into ten classes. For {{each of these}} classes, the surfaces in the class can be parametrized by a moduli space. For most of the classes the moduli spaces are well understood, but for the class of surfaces of general type the moduli spaces <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> complicated to describe explicitly, though some components are known.|$|E

5000|$|A New York Times review {{called the}} film [...] "caustically witty but slight." [...] It {{goes on to}} say that [...] "Švankmajer {{conceived}} the film in the 1970s, when it <b>seemed</b> <b>too</b> risky a political allegory to be made ... it now <b>seems</b> <b>too</b> simple a statement about how people are devoured by mechanistic states and each other." ...|$|R

25|$|But {{loudness}} jumps are {{not limited}} to inter-channel differences; they also exist between programme material within the same channel. Loudness differences are a frequent source of audience complaints, especially TV commercials and promos that <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> loud. Complicating this is that many broadcasters use (quasi-)peak meters and peak-levelling. Unfortunately the peak level reading does not correlate well with the perceived loudness. It basically should only be used to prevent overmodulation.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} {{that it may be}} related to Cirroteuthis, and in that case the two posterior stumps, looking like arms, may be the remains of the lateral fins, for they <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> far back for the arms, unless pulled out of position. On the other hand, they seem to be too far forward for fins. So that they are probably arms twisted out of their true position.|$|E
25|$|Gilovich {{offers two}} {{different}} explanations for why people believe hot hands exist. The {{first is that}} a person may be biased towards looking for streaks before watching a basketball game. This bias would then affect their perceptions and recollection of the game (confirmation bias). The second explanation deals with people’s inability to recognize chance sequences. People expect chance sequences to alternate between the options more than they actually do. Chance sequences can <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> lumpy, and are thus dismissed as non-chance (clustering illusion).|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} morning, the bear inexplicably begins to hammer away at iron. He's roaring loudly, {{almost as if}} in song, and no one understands why. However, the men join him and, in essence, lose {{themselves}} in the hard work. Prushevsky does not follow suit. A girl asks him to teach her knowledge, and he leaves the worksite with her. The activist receives {{a letter from the}} Soviet government stating that any peasants who <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> willing to have their property collectivized should be treated with suspicion as undercover agents.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} many deep and wide ranging conjectures in number theory whose proofs <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> {{difficult}} for current techniques, {{such as the}} Twin prime conjecture which asks whether there are infinitely many primes p such that p+2 is prime. On the assumption of the Elliott–Halberstam conjecture it has been proven recently that there are infinitely many primes p such that p+k is prime for some positive even k at most12. Also, it has been proven unconditionally (i.e. not depending on unproven conjectures) that there are infinitely many primes p such that p+k is prime for some positive even k at most246.|$|E
25|$|In the 2005 Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament where tag {{teams are}} formed by pairing a veteran wrestler with a rookie, a quarterfinal match pitted B.G. James with Cassidy Riley against Ron Killings and Sonjay Dutt on the August 19, 2005, episode of TNA Impact! Eventually B.G and The Truth ended up {{facing each other}} in the ring, but they refused to fight, drawing the ire of their {{respective}} partners. Ultimately B.G. hit Cassidy with the Pumphandle Drop after Cassidy, an admirer of Raven, used one of Raven's moves on The Truth. This allowed Sonjay to hit the Hindu Press and get the pin for the victory, advancing with The Truth to the semifinals. B.G. did not <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> upset to lose the match, and celebrated with Ron and Sonjay. Konnan also participated in the tournament, teamed with Lance Hoyt, but both remaining 3LK teams were eliminated in the semifinals. The full tandem won a match against the Diamonds in the Rough at Unbreakable on September 11.|$|E

500|$|Matt Groening {{has noted}} the {{challenges}} of sound mixing with this episode, the results of which influenced future episodes of the show and Groening's other series Futurama. When the animation for the episode returned, the production staff found the scene of Homer fighting Smithers [...] "horrifying", as the sounds of character exertion made it <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> violent. After experimenting with the sound, they were eventually {{able to make the}} scene humorous by only leaving in sounds of the characters' agony.|$|E

A big guy like that who's that athletic, you just don't believe what you're seeing.” Particularly noted for his lower body strength, Cody had a squat max of [...] in junior college.|$|E
500|$|O'Hara instead {{starred in}} the Technicolor war picture, To the Shores of Tripoli, her first Technicolor picture and first {{on-screen}} partnership with John Payne, in which she portrayed Navy nurse Lieutenant Mary Carter. Though the film was a considerable commercial success, becoming a benchmark for [...] "service pictures" [...] of the era, O'Hara later commented that she [...] "couldn't understand why {{the quality of his}} (Bruce Humberstone's) pictures never seemed to match their impressive box-office receipts". Malone wrote that [...] "nobody in the film seemed to have lived life. The character's emotions, like their uniforms, <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> streamlined".|$|E

500|$|Publishers Weekly {{commented that}} in the book Godwin put forth [...] "an unusually broad view of free speech". The review noted that by citing {{noteworthy}} legal cases affecting free speech online, [...] "he frames nicely {{some of the issues}} raised by the encounter of the 200-year-old Bill of Rights and the cutting-edge Internet." [...] Publishers Weekly wrote {{that by the end of}} the book, [...] "his arguments have become predictable – or flimsy, as when he implies that the Net poses no new risks with its dissemination of dangerous information, such as bomb-making instructions, because libraries have carried such information for years." [...] The review concluded, [...] "Godwin's book is a thoughtful examination of an important subject, but its thoughts <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> often filtered through rose-colored screens." ...|$|E

[...] The defect {{was found to be}} a [...] "fin", excess metal {{at the edge of the}} coin, making it <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> thick when inserted in machines. [...] The fin could also break off, leaving the silver coins underweight. [...] The problem was found on the pattern half dollars as well.

500|$|On April 30, von Horn {{was sent}} to {{discover}} what kind of force was required. A few days later, he met with Amer in Cairo {{and found out that}} Egypt had no intention of drawing all its troops from Yemen. After a few more days, he was told by the Saudi deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Omar Saqqaff, that the Saudis would not accept any attempt by Egypt to leave security forces after their withdrawal. Saudi Arabia had already been cutting back on its support to the royalists, in part because Egypt's projected plan for unity with Syria and Iraq made Nasser <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> dangerous. By that time, the war cost Egypt $1,000,000 a day and nearly 5,000 casualties. Though promising to remove her troops, Egypt had the privilege of leaving an unspecified number for the [...] "training" [...] of Yemen's republican army.|$|E

500|$|James Hunt, {{reviewing}} [...] "Sarek" [...] for Den of Geek in 2014, {{appreciated the}} episode's {{metaphor for the}} declining health of Gene Roddenberry. He {{felt that there was}} no follow-up to the emotional disturbances suffered by the crew, but said that despite this the episode worked {{because of the presence of}} Lenard as Sarek. He said that [...] "they cunningly build up [...] respect for Picard throughout the episode so that the proposed solution to his problem doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> far-fetched, and the rapport between Lenard and Stewart is so immediate that you can believe a literal mind-meld makes sense for the characters. It's not a perfect episode in terms of its writing, but the acting sells it far better than it could've." [...] In 2014, the episode was ranked as the 70th best out of the over 700 episodes in the Star Trek franchise by Charlie Jane Anders for io9.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Sonny and Cher's {{music had}} ceased to chart. According to Berman, [...] "the heavy, loud sound of groups like Jefferson Airplane and Cream made the folk-rock music of Sonny and Cher <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> bland." [...] Cher later commented, [...] "I loved the new sound of Led Zeppelin, Eric Clapton, the electric-guitar {{oriented}} bands. Left to myself, I would have changed with the times because the music really turned me on. But Son didn't like it—and that was that." [...] Their monogamous lifestyle during the period of the sexual revolution and the anti-drug position they adopted {{at the height of the}} drug culture eventually made the duo lose their popular appeal among American youths. According to Bego, [...] "in spite of their revolutionary unisex clothes, Sonny and Cher were quite 'square' when it came to sex and drugs." [...] In an attempt to recapture their young audience, the duo produced and starred in the film Good Times (1967), which was commercially unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 38, High {{provides}} more {{detail about the}} einherjar. Gangleri says that [...] "you say that all those men that have fallen in battle {{since the beginning of}} the world have now come to Odin in Val-hall. What has he got to offer them food? I should have thought that there must be a pretty large number there." [...] High replies that it is true there are a pretty large number of men there, adding many more have yet to arrive, yet that [...] "there will <b>seem</b> <b>too</b> few when the wolf comes." [...] However, High adds that food is not a problem because there will never be too many people in Valhalla that the meat of Sæhrímnir (which he calls a boar) cannot sufficiently feed. High says that Sæhrímnir is cooked every day by the cook Andhrímnir in the pot Eldhrimnir, and is again whole every evening. High then quotes the stanza of Grímnismál mentioning the cook, meal, and container in reference.|$|E
