40|$|This Standard {{is one of}} {{a series}} of ECMA Standards which are {{applicable}} to Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). Its purpose is to serve as a general and common reference for all addressing-related statements in other standards on PISNs. This Standard is based on the ISDN concept as developed by ITU-T and refined by ETSI for European applications, but modified to cover the particularities of PISNs. It conforms to the framework of International Standards for Open Systems Interconnection as defined by ISO/IEC. This particular Standard enables the Administrator of a PISN to choose whether • the ISDN Numbering Plan according to ITU-T Rec. E. 164, or • a Private Numbering Plan, or • an Implicit Numbering Plan, or • an OSI NSAP addressing plan, or • any combination of these numbering plans shall be employed as native numbering plan(s) in its PISN (PISN NP). In addition, the Administrator can employ PISN <b>subaddressing</b> in order to expand the addressing capacity beyond the capacity of the PISN NP. The impact of this on terminal interchangeability between accesses of public and private ISDNs is indicated in annex D...|$|E

50|$|Within the dataway, modules are {{addressed}} by slot (geographical addressing).

A slot commanded by the controller with one of 32 function codes (0-31).

50|$|In {{the case}} of an RT to RT HS transfer, the BC sends an HS action word to the {{receiving}} HS RT, instructing it to receive the HS message with a specified block count value at the specified <b>subaddress.</b> The receiving RT will then reply on the LS channel with an LS status word indicating it received the HS action word. The BC will then, after an intermessage gap on the LS channel, send another HS action word to the transmitting HS RT, instructing it to transmit the message, normally with the same block count value, and from one of its <b>subaddresses.</b> The transmitting RT will then reply on the LS channel with an LS status word indicating it received the HS action word and completing the HS control format. The HS RT transmitting an HS message will then begin its transmission within a maximum time measured from the parity (last) bit of the transmit HS action word. This initialization time is specified in the slash sheets, though all those in the current, draft standard are 24 to 32 µS. If the receiving HS RT does not receive the start of the HS message within a specified (in the slash sheet) time, which should be sufficient {{for the duration of the}} HS control format and the initialization time of the transmitter, it is required to timeout.|$|R
