5|$|He had {{intended}} {{to go to the}} bar, but in the October term of 1802 he chanced to hear Charles Simeon <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> the good done in India by a single missionary, William Carey, and some time afterwards he read the life of David Brainerd, a missionary to the Native Americans. He resolved, accordingly, to become a missionary himself. On 22 October 1803, he was ordained deacon at Ely, and afterwards priest, and served as Simeon's curate at the Church of Holy Trinity, taking charge of the neighbouring parish of Lolworth.|$|E

The British tabloid The Sun posted a video of a woman, alleged to be Winehouse, apparently smoking crack cocaine and <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> having taken ecstasy and valium. Winehouse's father moved in with her, and Island Records, her record label, announced the abandonment of plans for an American promotion campaign on her behalf. In late January 2008, Winehouse reportedly entered a rehabilitation facility for a two-week treatment program.|$|E

5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats and mice, which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, <b>Speaking</b> <b>of</b> Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E

During the mid-1990s, Ray's film essays and {{an anthology of}} short stories were also published in English in the West. Our Films, Their Films is an anthology of film criticism by Ray. The book contains articles and personal journal excerpts. The book {{is presented in two}} sections: Ray first discusses Indian film, before turning his attention toward Hollywood, specific filmmakers (Charlie Chaplin and Akira Kurosawa), and movements such as Italian neorealism. His book Bishoy Chalachchitra was published in translation in 2006 as <b>Speaking</b> <b>of</b> Films. It contains a compact description of his philosophy of different aspects of the cinemas.|$|E

He also <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> the supports at UW-Eau Claire. From 2003 - 2005, Rightmire organized Pride in Eau Claire. He <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> the events offered and of the struggles of maintaining the event. The LGBTQ Community Center in Eau Claire is struggling to stay afloat and Rightmire <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> that struggle.

5|$|In 1935, under Albery's management, John Gielgud staged Romeo and Juliet at the New Theatre, co-starring with Peggy Ashcroft, Edith Evans and Olivier. Gielgud {{had seen}} Olivier in Queen of Scots, spotted his potential, and now {{gave him a}} major step up in his career. For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played Mercutio and Olivier played Romeo, after which they {{exchanged}} roles. The production broke all box-office records for the play, running for 189 performances. Olivier was enraged at the notices after the first night, which praised the virility of his performance but fiercely criticised his <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> Shakespeare's verse, contrasting it with his co-star's mastery of the poetry. The friendship {{between the two men}} was prickly, on Olivier's side, {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|It is a dance-pop {{song with}} heavy, {{pounding}} synths. The song {{also has a}} fast techno beat with electroclash and Eurodisco influences. Gaga speaks the first verse {{and parts of the}} chorus of the song faux-German, as the name of the song is German. The lyrics have a feminist tone, <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> female empowerment. The song received positive reviews from contemporary critics, who complimented its heavy dance beat and catchy chorus, despite criticizing the faux-German lyrics and Gaga's accent. The song charted on the South Korean Gaon Music Chart and US Billboard dance charts, as well as entering the component charts in Canada, Germany, and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Jackson gave a 90-minute {{interview}} to Oprah Winfrey on February 10, 1993, his second television interview since 1979. He grimaced when <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> his childhood abuse {{at the hands}} of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of the Elephant Man, slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated {{for the first time that}} he had vitiligo. Dangerous re-entered the album chart in the top 10, more than a year after its original release.|$|E

More formally, the couple's families celebrate the marriage with a feast. The parties give back their betrothal rings and receive others worn on their index fingers. The bride’s mother gives the groom a jewel to wear (Galadriel's gift of the Elfstone to Aragorn reflects this tradition; she is grandmother to his betrothed, Arwen, Arwen's mother Celebrían having left Middle-earth for Valinor after grievous psychological injury after her capture by Orcs and liberation by her sons).|$|E
5|$|Raskolnikov, a {{conflicted}} former student, {{lives in}} a tiny, rented room in Saint Petersburg. He refuses all help, even from his friend Razumikhin, and devises a plan to murder and rob an elderly pawn-broker and money-lender, Alyona Ivanovna. His motivation comes from the overwhelming sense that he is predetermined to kill the old woman by some power outside of himself. While still considering the plan, Raskolnikov makes the acquaintance of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, a drunkard who recently squandered his family's little wealth. Raskolnikov also receives a letter from his sister and mother, <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> their coming visit to Saint Petersburg, and his sister's sudden marriage plans which they plan to discuss upon their arrival.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor uses Amy's {{communication}} chip {{to track}} her location, and lands the TARDIS in the Silence's control room five days later. As River and Rory hold the Silence at bay, the Doctor shows them the live {{broadcast of the}} moon landing. As they watch, the Doctor uses his modification of the Apollo command module to insert Canton's recording of the wounded Silent into the footage of the landing. Because of this message, humans will now turn upon the Silence whenever they see them. The group frees Amy and departs in the TARDIS, while River kills all the Silence in the control room. Amy reassures Rory that the man he overheard her <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> loving through the communication chip was him, not the Doctor.|$|E

To replenish these, II./JG54 was {{withdrawn from the}} Channel Front on 3 December 1940 and stationed at Delmenhorst. The pilots were sent on a ski vacation at Kitzbühl and given home leave. Philipp made a public propaganda appearance at his Franziskaneum home school on 16 December, <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> his actions as fighter pilot. On 15 January 1941, his unit was moved to Le Mans, southwest of Paris, to protect the airspace over Normandy.

No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others.
