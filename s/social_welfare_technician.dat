40|$|This paper {{considers}} Shigeo Okamura’s Principles of <b>Social</b> <b>Welfare</b> (1983) {{by discussing}} the logical structure of Okamura’s <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> theory, as grounded as a “unique <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> perspective”, and then elucidates {{some of the}} challenges to its further development. The features of Okamura’s <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> theory may be summarized as follows: (1) a critical collaboration between “legislated” and “voluntary” models of <b>social</b> <b>welfare,</b> (2) a “unique <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> perspective” grounded in the “basic requirements of social life” and “subjective aspects of social relations”, and (3) the principles of assistance that are derived from this “unique <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> perspective. ” To further the development of Okamura’s <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> theory, the following questions arise. Does <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> develop irrevocably along a single track? Can the basic requirements of social life still have any validity today? Is the assistance derived from his unique <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> perspective effective in actual practice? What sort of challenges to social structures could render such assistance effective? By corroborating such challenges {{with a focus on}} the ordinary people’s perspectives, {{it will be possible to}} facilitate the further development and expansion of Okamura’s <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> theory. 本論では、岡村重夫の『社会福祉原論』（ 1983 年）をテキストとし、「社会福祉固有の視点」にもとづく岡村社会福祉論の論理構造を検討し、発展的検討に向けた課題の一端を明らかにした。岡村の社会福祉論の特徴は、（１）「法律による社会福祉」と「自発的な社会福祉」との批判的協力関係、（２）「社会生活の基本的要求」と「社会関係の主体的側面」に基づく「社会福祉固有の視点」、（３）「社会福祉固有の視点」から導き出される援助の原理、という３点にまとめることができる。岡村社会福祉論の更なる展開のために以下のような課題が引き出される。社会福祉は後戻りすることなく単線的に発展するのか。社会生活の基本的要求は今日においても妥当性を持ちうるのか。社会福祉固有の視点から導き出される援助は実際に有効なのだろうか。そうした援助を有効なものとしうる社会構造上の課題とはいかなるものなのか。生活当事者の視点を中心に据えた検証作業によって、岡村社会福祉論の発展は可能となる...|$|R

In the <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> sector, the White Paper for <b>Social</b> <b>Welfare</b> of 1997 was adopted as <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> policy for South Africa. The White Paper for <b>Social</b> <b>Welfare</b> is embedded in a developmental approach and charted a new path for <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> in the promotion of national social development. Developmental <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> is a pro poor strategy which strives to promote a welfare system that facilitates the development of human capacity and self-reliance within a caring and enabling socio-economic environment. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the progress of <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> service delivery towards a developmental <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> approach in the Vhembe district, Limpopo. A qualitative research approach was used for this study and the research design was an instrumental case study. The sample for the study was selected purposively and included 28 social workers and four supervisors from four sub-districts in the Vhembe district. Data was collected through four focus group interviews with social workers and one-on-one interviews with the supervisors. Research findings indicate that developmental <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> service delivery in this district has progressed in terms of protective services to families and children. However, in terms of poverty reduction and sustainable livelihoods, the social service sector still lags behind. The overall conclusion is that the progress of <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> service delivery towards the developmental approach is slow and unsatisfactory. The recommendations of this study are captured in strategies that social workers could use to promote progress in developmental <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> service delivery, strategies suggested for supervisors to promote progress in developmental <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> service delivery, and lastly strategies on the creation of an enabling environment.

30|$|From this proposition, {{the fixed}} {{cost of the}} air–rail mode and non-purchase quality in market 2 play an {{important}} role in determining the effectiveness of cooperation on <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> for the whole market. When the non-purchase quality in market 2 is high, the effect of cooperation on <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> for the whole market depends on the welfare in market 3, because cooperation does not impact the welfare in market 2 by Proposition  4.6. Thus, in this case, the fixed cost of the air–rail mode affects the <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> for the whole market. When the non-purchase quality in market 2 is relatively low, we need to consider the balance between the decrease in <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> in market 2 and the increase in <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> in market 3. Since the amount of <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> in each market depends largely on the number of potential customers, the <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> will be increased by cooperation if the amount of <b>social</b> <b>welfare</b> in the connecting market is relatively large.
