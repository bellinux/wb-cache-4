5|$|Below {{leaders are}} the uniformed role of <b>Sectional</b> Assistant and the non-uniformed role of Occasional Helper. The <b>Sectional</b> Assistant has to {{complete}} basic training {{consisting of the}} values of the association, safety and child protection only while an occasional helper is a non-uniformed role and requires only to have a criminal records check by the Disclosure and Barring Service. In addition, there are Young Leaders who must complete training in child protection and safety and then have the option to complete further modules on topics that mirror the adult training programme.|$|E
5|$|James Buchanan {{was easily}} elected President in 1856.

It was not until thirty years after the Civil War that the so-called Cuban Question again came to national prominence.|$|E

The top four skaters in each Championship event qualify for the Championship event at Nationals.

5|$|Stevens {{attended}} Zionsville Community High School, {{where he}} became a star basketball player. He wore No. 31 {{in high school in}} honor of Indiana Pacers guard Reggie Miller. During his freshman year, he would get up early to practice shooting at a local gym before school. The hard work paid off as Stevens made the varsity team that same year. By the time his high school career was complete, Stevens had set school records for career scoring, assists, steals, and three-point field goals. As of 2010, he still holds the records for points (1508), assists (444), and steals (156), as well as the single-season points record (644 in 1995). Stevens was named to the all-conference team three times. In 1995, he was named the <b>sectional</b> MVP and was the leading scorer in state <b>sectional</b> play (32.3 ppg).|$|E

He earned the Post-Tribune Boys basketball player of the year award for Northwest Indiana and the state MVP from the Indiana Basketball News.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he owned}} a number of slaves, and his {{marriage}} to Virginia Shelby had {{left him with a}} good many more, Breckinridge had been a supporter of gradual emancipation and colonization of blacks since his early political career. As the <b>sectional</b> crisis worsened, this led him into several high-profile debates, notably with fellow Kentuckian Robert Wickliffe, the uncle of Robert C. Wickliffe. His support of Abraham Lincoln for president in the election of 1860 pitted him against his own nephew, Vice President John C. Breckinridge.|$|E

5|$|Around 1830, Providence had {{manufacturing}} {{industries in}} metals, machinery, textiles, jewelry, and silverware. Manufacturing has declined since, {{but the city}} {{is still one of}} the largest centers for jewelry and silverware design and manufacturing. Services also make up a large portion of the city's economy, in particular education, healthcare, and finance. Providence also is the site of a <b>sectional</b> center facility (SCF), a regional hub for the U.S. Postal Service. It is the capital of Rhode Island, so the city's economy additionally consists of government services.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>sectional</b> {{conflict}} {{leading up}} to the Civil War escalated, Breckinridge was put in the unusual position of being a slaveholder who opposed slavery. His support of Abraham Lincoln for president in the election of 1860 put him at odds with his nephew, John C. Breckinridge. The tragic scenario of brother against brother literally played out in Breckinridge's family, with two of his sons joining each side during the war. Following the war, Breckinridge retired to his home in Danville, where he died on December 27, 1871.|$|E

5|$|Because of his height, Ulis was {{overlooked}} {{until well}} into the recruiting process for top basketball schools. He was not highly recruited until his 201314 senior year of high school. Among schools regarded as high-major programs, only Iowa and DePaul made him offers during his junior year. His other offers were from Dayton, Colorado State, Loyola, Northern Illinois and Oregon State. During his junior season, his stock soared and Marian Catholic started winning. In the March 2013 Illinois High School Association Class 4A <b>sectional</b> round, Marian Catholic vied against Bloom High School and then played Edwardsville High School in the supersectional round. Although Marian lost to a much taller Edwardsville team, it established a school record for wins with a 294 record and it won its IHSA <b>sectional</b> for the first time. Ulis finished fourth in the Illinois Mr. Basketball balloting behind Jabari Parker, Jahlil Okafor and Malcolm Hill. He was a first team All-state selection by the Chicago Tribune along with Parker, Okafor, Cliff Alexander and Jalen Brunson.|$|E
5|$|By resubmitting the discredited treaty {{through a}} House-sponsored bill, the Tyler {{administration}} reignited <b>sectional</b> hostilities over Texas admission. Both northern Democratic and southern Whig Congressmen had been bewildered by local political agitation {{in their home}} states during the 1844 presidential campaigns. Now, northern Democrats found themselves vulnerable to charges of appeasement of their southern wing if they capitulated to Tyler's slavery expansion provisions. On the other hand, Manifest Destiny enthusiasm in the north placed politicians under pressure to admit Texas immediately to the Union.|$|E
5|$|Carl Meissner demoted Eubanksia to <b>sectional</b> rank in his 1856 classification, {{and divided}} it into four series, with B.brownii placed in series Dryandroideae.

5|$|In 1850, the <b>sectional</b> {{differences}} that eventually {{culminated in the}} Civil War led to a convention {{to be held in}} Nashville, Tennessee, for the purpose of defining a common course of action for all Southern (slave-holding) states. Although Mallory had held no statewide offices, he was regarded as sufficiently powerful in the state Democratic Party to be chosen as an alternate delegate to the convention. Personal considerations kept him from attending, but he expressed his agreement with the purposes of the convention in a letter that was widely reprinted in the Florida newspapers.|$|E

5|$|Pierce and his {{administration}} used threats and promises to keep most Democrats on board {{in favor of the}} bill. The Whigs split along <b>sectional</b> lines; the conflict destroyed them as a national party. The Kansas–Nebraska Act was passed in May 1854 and would come to define the Pierce presidency. The political turmoil that followed the passage saw the short-term rise of the nativist and anti-Catholic American Party, often called the Know Nothings, and the founding of the Republican Party.|$|E

In addition to adult leadership, the association encourages its members themselves to take on positions of responsibility for their section meetings. This can be through responsibility for a group of members, such as the Patrol Leader and Assistant Patrol Leader in Scouts and Sixers and Seconders in Cubs, or through <b>sectional</b> forums to feedback on programmes.
