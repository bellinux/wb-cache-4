40|$|Low Earth Orbits (LEO) {{satellites}} {{are used}} for public communication and for scientific purposes. These satellites provide opportunities for investigations for which alternative techniques are either difficult or impossible to apply. Ground stations have to be established in order to communicate with such satellites. Usually these <b>satellites</b> communicate with <b>ground</b> stations at S-band. The communication quality depends {{on the performance of}} the <b>satellite</b> <b>ground</b> station, in addition to that of satellite. The performance of the <b>satellite</b> <b>ground</b> stations is expressed through Figure of Merit. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the rain attenuation impact on the performance of the respective ground station. Rain attenuation depends on geographical location where the <b>satellite</b> <b>ground</b> station is implemented. In order to compare this effect on <b>satellite</b> <b>ground</b> station performance, some cities of Europe are considered. Finally, the rain attenuation impact on the <b>satellite</b> <b>ground</b> station Figure of Merit for the hypothetical <b>satellite</b> <b>ground</b> station installed in Prishtina is analyzed...|$|R

40|$|The {{principles}} surrounding space {{communications and}} high altitude earth observation are both fascinating and complex. To better understand this topic, a <b>satellite</b> <b>ground</b> station was constructed {{on the campus}} of Old Dominion University. It has the ability to automatically track, record, and decode NOAA weather satellite transmissions and communicate with {{other parts of the world}} via amateur radio <b>satellites.</b> The <b>satellite</b> <b>ground</b> station has been assembled from individual electronic components, each with an intended purpose. The collection of weather satellite images has been taking place over the past ten months, and all data is accessible through a searchable database on the World Wide Web. Since the <b>satellite</b> <b>ground</b> station is only one aspect of a space communications system, a simple remote sensing vehicle is currently being constructed. This vehicle is in fact a high altitude balloon, which when completed, will have the ability to record temperature and pressure variations in the earth’s atmosphere and take high altitude earth images. This balloon is projected to reach altitudes of approximately 90, 000 feet. All of the collected data will be continuously transmitted to the <b>satellite</b> <b>ground</b> station, thus illustrating a simple but complete space communications system...|$|R

40|$|Electronic beam {{steering}} via antenna arrays {{has the potential}} of replacing the mechanical steering at <b>satellite</b> <b>ground</b> stations. In this work, we exploit the benefits of antenna arrays at <b>satellite</b> <b>ground</b> stations combined with beamforming and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation techniques in combating interferences and compensating for erroneous knowledge of the spacecraft position. First, we propose two array geometries for the reception of payload data from lower earth orbiting (LEO) <b>satellites</b> at <b>ground</b> stations. Then considering a scenario where there exist cross-orbit spacecraft, the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer is employed to achieve the goal of the interference suppression and the reception of the desired signals. Moreover, by taking into account the potential errors in the a priori knowledge of the spacecraft flight path at lower elevation angles, we investigate the electronic tracking as a local refinement to compensate for these errors by resorting to DOA estimation techniques. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the advantages of employing antenna arrays in combination with signal processing techniques at <b>satellite</b> <b>ground</b> stations...|$|R
