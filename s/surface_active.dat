5|$|Fluctuations in {{the orbits}} of the moons {{indicate}} that their mean density decreases with distance from Jupiter. Callisto, the outermost and least dense of the four, has a density intermediate between ice and rock whereas Io, the innermost and densest moon, has a density intermediate between rock and iron. Callisto has an ancient, heavily cratered and unaltered ice surface {{and the way it}} rotates indicates that its density is equally distributed, suggesting that it has no rocky or metallic core but consists of a homogeneous mix of rock and ice. This may well have been the original structure of all the moons. The rotation of the three inner moons, in contrast, indicates differentiation of their interiors with denser matter at the core and lighter matter above. They also reveal significant alteration of the surface. Ganymede reveals past tectonic movement of the ice surface which required partial melting of subsurface layers. Europa reveals more dynamic and recent movement of this nature, suggesting a thinner ice crust. Finally, Io, the innermost moon, has a sulfur <b>surface,</b> <b>active</b> volcanism and no sign of ice. All this evidence suggests that the nearer a moon is to Jupiter the hotter its interior. The current model is that the moons experience tidal heating {{as a result of the}} gravitational field of Jupiter in inverse proportion to the square of their distance from the giant planet. In all but Callisto this will have melted the interior ice, allowing rock and iron to sink to the interior and water to cover the surface. In Ganymede a thick and solid ice crust then formed. In warmer Europa a thinner more easily broken crust formed. In Io the heating is so extreme that all the rock has melted and water has long ago boiled out into space.|$|E

2500|$|Equilibrium {{of forces}} on the surface is {{required}} for a bubble to exist. The sum of the Ambient pressure and pressure due to tissue distortion, exerted {{on the outside of}} the surface, with surface tension of the liquid at the interface between the bubble and the surroundings must be balanced by the pressure on the inside of the bubble. This is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases inside due to the net diffusion of gas to and from the bubble. The force balance on the bubble may be modified by a layer of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> molecules which can stabilise a microbubble at a size where surface tension on a clean bubble would cause it to collapse rapidly, and this surface layer may vary in permeability, so that if the bubble is sufficiently compressed it may become impermeable to diffusion. If the solvent outside the bubble is saturated or unsaturated, the partial pressure will be less than in the bubble, and the surface tension will be increasing the internal pressure in direct proportion to surface curvature, providing a pressure gradient to increase diffusion out of the bubble, effectively [...] "squeezing the gas out of the bubble", and the smaller the bubble the faster it will get squeezed out. A gas bubble can only grow at constant pressure if the surrounding solvent is sufficiently supersaturated to overcome the surface tension or if the surface layer provides sufficient reaction to overcome surface tension. Clean bubbles that are sufficiently small will collapse due to surface tension if the supersaturation is low. Bubbles with semipermeable surfaces will either stabilise at a specific radius depending on the pressure, the composition of the surface layer, and the supersaturation, or continue to grow indefinitely, if larger than the critical radius. Bubble formation can occur in the blood or other tissues.|$|E

40|$|We propose {{an optimal}} {{framework}} for <b>active</b> <b>surface</b> extraction from video sequences. An <b>active</b> <b>surface</b> {{is a collection}} of active contours in successive frames such that the active contours are constrained by spatial and temporal energy terms. The spatial energy terms impose constraints on the active contour in a given frame. The temporal energy terms relate the active contours in different frames to preserve desired internal and external properties of the <b>active</b> <b>surface.</b> For computational efficiency, we reduce the 3 -D <b>active</b> <b>surface</b> ((x, y, t) coordinates) optimization problem to a 2 -D model ((φ, t) coordinates) by considering only point indices along normal lines φ of each contour and define the energy terms in a causal way.

40|$|Abstract. Variational energy {{minimization}} {{techniques for}} surface reconstruction are implemented by evolving an <b>active</b> <b>surface</b> {{according to the}} solutions of a sequence of elliptic partial differential equations (PDE’s). For these techniques, most current approaches to solving the elliptic PDE are iterative involving the implementation of costly finite element methods (FEM) or finite difference methods (FDM). The heavy computational cost of these methods makes practical application to 3 D surface reconstruction burdensome. In this paper, we develop a fast spectral method which is applied to 3 D <b>active</b> <b>surface</b> reconstruction of star-shaped surfaces parameterized in polar coordinates. For this parameterization the Euler-Lagrange equation is a Helmholtz-type PDE governing a diffusion on the unit sphere. After linearization, we implement a spectral non-iterative solution of the Helmholtz equation by representing the <b>active</b> <b>surface</b> as a double Fourier series over angles in spherical coordinates. We show how this approach can be extended to include region-based penalization. A number of 3 D examples and simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of our fast spectral <b>active</b> <b>surface</b> algorithms...|$|R
