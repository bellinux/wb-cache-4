40|$|The {{telecommunications}} {{markets in}} the European Union have gone {{through a period of}} rapid technological as well as economic change. After the market opening in the late 1990 s, the approach to regulate these markets has likewise changed over time. Whereas a sectorspecific framework dominated the phase from 1998 - 2002, a more prominent role of competition law regulating telecommunications markets has become visible within the last years. The two reviews of the regulatory framework (2002 and 2010) have seen sector-specific measures being scaled back and competition law measures gaining a more prominent role. This paper tries to analyse the development from sector-specific regulation towards competition law in its application to telecommunications {{markets in the}} EU. It draws conclusions from the changes in the different reviews and demonstrates how these modifications of the framework have taken place. Additionally, the practical implementations are analysed with respect to two countries. Despite the fact, that EU member states are following a joint approach (EU framework), there are still differences on the national level as regards the application of regulatory instruments and the regulation of specific markets. This can be demonstrated by looking at how national regulatory authorities conduct the process of for example market definition, market analysis, SMP designation and levying of remedies. In the paper Germany and Austria are analysed, two neighbouring countries, with similar principles in the transposition of EU frameworks into national legislation, but with strongly different outcomes as regards specific regulatory measures in terms of e. g. market analysis, price regulation, organisation of the regulatory authorities etc. Thereby we demonstrate that although the EU framework tends to achieve harmonisation, there are still a number of differences between member states in practical implementation. The paper is organised as follows: after the introduction in section 1, section 2 draws the picture of the development of the most important elements of the EU regulatory framework over time. Thereby. we specifically look at the issues of market definition, analysis and dominance designation but also issues of access and interconnection are analyzed. This encompasses conclusions regarding the overall trends of development {{in the design of the}} EU regulatory framework. Section 3 analyses the corresponding developments in the Austrian and the German telecommunications act, especially with respect to the balance between the role of sector-specific regulation and competition law in national legislation. This is done be looking at some specific topics such as, market definition and analysis, organization of the regulatory authority, potential conflicts between regulatory authority and competition authority regarding competences and responsibilities, possibilities of enforcement, and the treatment of margin <b>squeeze.</b> <b>Section</b> 4 contains our conclusions with respect to the practical implementation in member states against the overall goal of harmonisation and demonstrates differences in the way EU legislation has been transposed to national legislation in a comparison between Germany and Austria.

40|$|A {{procedure}} {{for the application}} of designed support measures for tunnelling in fault zones with squeezing potential is presented in this paper. Criteria for the support decision based on quantitative parameters are defined. These criteria provide an objective basis for the assignment of the designed support categories to the actual ground conditions. Besides the explanation of the criteria and the implementation into the general geomechanical design process an example from the Egnatia Odos project in Greece is given. The Metsovo tunnel is located in a geomechanical difficult area including fault zones and a major thrust zone with high overburden.

40|$|Growing {{demand of}} {{electricity}} in Nepal can be fulfilled by hydropower generation. The huge potentiality of hydropower generation in Nepal is mainly due to abundant water resources and available geographical head due to steep Rivers. In medium and large hydropower projects, {{huge amount of}} water discharge has to be handled form intake to power station and ultimately back to river again. Also, because of steep topography, the construction of pipe and canal {{on the surface of}} terrain could be very difficult and expensive for larger discharges. Hence, underground construction such as tunnels or shafts could only be the feasible options of water conveyance system for large discharges and in case of steep terrains. But, at the same time, there are higher risks and uncertainties associated with the underground works like tunnels and shafts or caverns. The main risks and uncertainties associated with the underground works are stress induced instability, water leakage, mud flows and finally the cost overrun during construction. When there is overstressing of rock mass that means rock stresses exceed the strength of rock mass, there will be stress induced instability in the tunnel. If the rock mass is very weak, schistose and deformable, squeezing phenomenon will occur with the development of plastic zone around the tunnel which causes excessive deformation of tunnel. In the Himalayan region, due to the high degree of schistocity, fracturing and shearing, weak rocks such as mudstone, shale, slate, phyllite, schist, highly schistose gneiss and the rock mass of the tectonic fault zones are not capable to withstand the high stresses. Basically, squeezing has been common phenomenon in the tunnels in these weak and deformable rock masses. In this thesis, Chameliya Hydroelectric Project (CHEP), located in far western region of Nepal, has been taken as the case study. In this project, huge squeezing problem occurred in about 800 m stretch of headrace tunnel from chainage 3 + 100 m to 3 + 900 m. The most affected section is about 550 m in between these chainages. At several locations in <b>squeezing</b> <b>section,</b> the tunnel wall closure (deformation) has been recorded well over 1. 0 m in an average and the maximum above 2. 0 m where the original tunnel diameter is 5. 2 m. Hence, the thesis basically deals with squeezing analysis of the case using different approaches. Rock types along the headrace tunnel alignment are dolomite, slate, talcosic phyllite and dolomite intercalated with phyllite. Mostly, talcosic phylite has been found in the <b>squeezed</b> <b>section.</b> The rock mass quality in the <b>squeezed</b> <b>section</b> is extremely poor to exceptionally poor. The main objectives of this thesis are the assessment of squeezing phenomenon, evaluation of stability of the tunnel and support pressure estimation. In this thesis, four main methods have been used to evaluate the squeezing phenomenon viz.; empirical methods such as Singh et al (1992) and Q-system (Grimstad and Barton, 1993), semi-analytical method such as Hoek and Marinos (2000), analytical method such as Convergence Confinement Method (Carranza-Torres and Fairhurst, 2000) and numerical program Phase 2. Initially, seventeen tunnel sections at different chainages have been taken into consideration. The squeezing prediction criteria, such as Singh et al (1992), Q-system and Hoek and Marinos (2000) approach, show that there is severe squeezing in last ten sections. Hence more detail squeezing analysis has been done for these ten sections using Hoek and Marinos (2000) and Convergence Confinement Method, and support pressure has also been estimated using these two approaches and Barton et al. (1974) approach. Hoek and Marinos (2000) and Convergence Confinement Method analysis show that there is significant amount of tunnel deformation to cause squeezing problems. The main factors that control the squeezing phenomenon are the rock mass parameters and rock stresses. Therefore, quality of squeezing analysis largely depends upon the correct estimation of these input parameters. The main components of rock stresses are gravity and tectonic stresses. The rock stresses in the project area were not measured, so Phase 2 program has been used to estimate the tectonic stress value from measured deformation. The tectonic stress value {{has been found to be}} equal to 3. 5 MPa in this area, but stress measurement will be necessary to verify this value. Uniaxial unconfined strength of intact rock in four tunnel sections has been back calculated from measured deformations using Phase 2 program and found to be in the range of 10 to 15 Mpa in the <b>squeezed</b> <b>section.</b> Later, the deformation has been calculated using Hoek and Marinos (2000) and Convergence Confinement Method for improved intact rock strength and compared with Phase 2 result. All analyses show that there is significant deformation to cause squeezing problem. In CHEP, tunnel cross section has reduced considerably in several stretches of tunnel. Due to the excessive deformation, temporary supports were provided at several locations, steel ribs and lattice girders are buckled at several locations and shotcrete lining is also cracked. All these have to be removed before application of final lining. Finally, two different possible solutions have been studied using Phase 2 program to address the existing problems in <b>squeezed</b> <b>section</b> of the headrace tunnel. </p...|$|R

Our study {{is based on an}} approximate analytic solution to the time-dependent harmonic oscillator equation with a subperiod function parameter. This continuous treatment differs from former studies that involve the matching of two time-independent solutions at the discontinuity. This formalism requires an ad hoc transformation of the original differential equation and isalso applicable for rapid, although not necessarily instantaneous, mass variations.

Introduction ing another transforrnation that produces a monotonic time-dependent parameter. The transformed equation can then be sol ved with the continuum approach, leading to squeezing of the momentum variables at certain times. An interesting ad-vantage of this method is that the change of mass need not be a step function in the strict mathematical sense. The require-ment, which is physically more plausible, is that the change in mass should take place in a time span much shorter than the characteristic period of the oscillator. The plan of the manuscript is the following: in Seco 2, we write the quadratic and linear invariants for a time-dependent mass and exhibit their relation with the Hamiltonian. In Seco 3, we discuss two transforrnations that translate the clas-sical time-dependent mass equation into the time dependent trequency problem. The analytic solution for a rapid varia-tion of the time dependent mass using the appropriate trans-formation is then presented. In Seco 4, we exhibit how a sudden change of mas s in the quantum oscillator produces <b>squeezing.</b> <b>Section</b> 5 is left for conclusions. 2. Time dependent mas...|$|R

40|$|Many {{risks and}} {{challenges}} {{are associated with}} large scale underground projects. Stability issues are typically related to high stresses around the opening. Excavations will change the existent stress regime in the ground, inducing tangential stresses around {{the periphery of the}} opening. Failure of the rock mass will occur if the induced stresses exceed the strength of the rock. In weak and deformable rocks, the process of failure may present as plastic deformation, better known as squeezing. Squeezing can be described as the time-dependent inward movement of the rock material towards the opening when subjected to tangential stress (Panthi, 2006). The squeezing phenomenon was reviewed in relation to the deformations experienced in the powerhouse cavern at the Neelum Jhelum HPP (NJHPP) in Pakistan. The cavern is constructed in fractured sandstone, with thin to thick layers of locally sheared siltstone and mudstone. The mean overburden is 430 m. Since constructions began in 2011, the deformations have been monitored progressively with convergence lines and extensometers. The highest deformation is seen for the middle sections, with up to 282 mm convergence of the walls. The objective of this study involves an evaluation of available methods for prediction and assessment of squeezing in large scale caverns. The deformation characteristics for the Neelum Jhelum HPP cavern are essential input for the analysis. Proper knowledge on the ground conditions and influencing factors are essential for a well-founded evaluation of the methods. The deformation data reveal a complex interplay of internal and external factors influencing the behavior of the rock. Weak and fractured rocks combined with the high overburden are the main cause for the high degree of squeezing. However, the variation in measured deformation is believed to be caused by the changing external factors. The two major influencing events accelerating the deformation was the excavation of the bulleted gate niches in the downstream wall (4 niches), and the excavation down to the bottom floor level. The intersecting and potentially water bearing shear zone may be the reason for the highest deformations observed for the middle sections. In this study, five methods are selected for the assessment of <b>squeezing</b> for five <b>sections</b> in the cavern. The empirical method by Goel (1994) and the Q-system are used for prediction of the occurrence of squeezing, along with the semi-analytical method by Hoek and Marinos (2000) without support pressure. Analysis of squeezing and required support pressure is investigated using Hoek and Marinos with support and with the CCM by Carranza-Torres and Fairhurst (2000). Extensive plastic analysis using the 2 D finite element program Phase^{ 2 } is included. Calibration of the stress conditions and rock mass deformability are {{an essential part of the}} numerical analysis. The deformation characteristics of a tunnel are less influenced by external factors, relative to the complexity involving a powerhouse cavern. The methods applied typically only consider stress conditions and rock mass quality and strength, and most have been developed for circular tunnels. The analysis of the deformations in the NJHPP cavern indicate that for a powerhouse cavern the complex excavation layout, large dimensions and excavation progress are major influencing factors. The effects of these are not properly considered by any of the selected methods. Consequently, special considerations are necessary for the analysis of squeezing in large caverns. </p...|$|R
