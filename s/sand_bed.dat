2500|$|For {{the case}} in which sand {{fraction}} is transported by the current over and through an immobile gravel bed, Kuhnle et al.(2013), following the theoretical analysis done by Pellachini (2011), provides a new relationship for the bed load transport of the sand fraction when gravel particles remain at rest. It is worth mentioning that Kuhnle et al. (2013) applied the Wilcock and Kenworthy (2002) formula to their experimental data {{and found out that}} predicted bed load rates of sand fraction were about 10 times greater than measured and approached 1 as the sand elevation became {{near the top of the}} gravel layer. They, also, hypothesized that the mismatch between predicted and measured <b>sand</b> <b>bed</b> load rates is due to the fact that the bed shear stress used for the Wilcock and Kenworthy (2002) formula [...] was larger than that available for transport within the gravel bed because of the sheltering effect of the gravel particles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle {{refers to the}} conversion of toxic ammonia to nitrite and finally nitrate. While fish waste (urine and feces) and decaying matter release ammonia, the majority of ammonia released (approximately 60%) in both marine and freshwater aquariums is excreted directly into {{the water from the}} fishes' gills. Biological (bacterial) nitrification converts the ammonia into nitrite ions, NO2-, and then to nitrate ions, NO3-. Nitrate is readily taken up and assimilated by algae and hermatypic corals. Some nitrate is converted via an anaerobic bacterial process to free nitrogen, but this process is very difficult to maintain. In the recent past, most nitrate, which is less toxic to fishes and most invertebrates than nitrites, accumulated in the water until it was physically removed by a water change. [...] However, many marine aquarists are now employing the use of a special section of the tank or separate tank altogether, called a [...] "refugium." [...] A refugium is, as its name suggests, a sheltered area that shares water with the primary, or display, tank. [...] Refugiums usually contain a deep <b>sand</b> <b>bed</b> to allow anoxic zones to develop within them where anaerobic bacteria can convert nitrate into nitrogen gas, a useful means of nitrate removal. [...] Various types of macroalgae can be grown and harvested from the refugium as another means of nitrate export. [...] As refugiums become more common in marine aquaria, nitrate levels are easily manageable for even the novice hobbyist. [...] Ammonia and nitrite should be tested regularly; any detectable levels (i.e., over 0 ppm) can be indicative of a problem. Nitrates should not exceed 2 ppm in reef tanks, or 20 ppm in fish-only tanks. It is sometimes acceptable to have a small amount of nitrate buildup, as some livestock, especially fish, are fairly tolerant of nitrate. Most corals, while able to assimilate nitrate, cannot be expected to survive, much less thrive, with high nitrate concentrations.|$|E
60|$|Yet, {{over those}} sunshiny days there hung a shadow, as of {{something}} kept back, not shared between them; {{a kind of}} waiting menace. Nedda learned of Kirsteen and Sheila all the useful things she could; the evenings she passed with Derek, those long evenings of late May and early June, this year so warm and golden. They walked generally {{in the direction of}} the hills. A favorite spot was a wood of larches whose green shoots had not yet quite ceased to smell of lemons. Tall, slender things those trees, whose stems and dried lower branch-growth were gray, almost sooty, up to the feathery green of the tops, that swayed and creaked faintly in a wind, with a soughing of their branches like the sound of the sea. From the shelter of those Highland trees, rather strange in such a countryside, they two could peer forth at the last sunlight gold-powdering the fringed branches, at the sunset flush dyeing the sky above the Beacon; watch light slowly folding gray wings above the hay-fields and the elms; mark the squirrels scurry along, and the pigeons' evening flight. A stream ran there at the edge, and beech-trees grew beside it. In the tawny-dappled <b>sand</b> <b>bed</b> of that clear water, and the gray-green dappled trunks of those beeches with their great, sinuous, long-muscled roots, was that something which man can never tame or garden out of the land: the strength of unconquerable fertility--the remote deep life in Nature's heart. Men and women had their spans of existence; those trees seemed as if there forever! From generation to generation lovers might come and, looking on this strength and beauty, feel in their veins the sap of the world. Here the laborer and his master, hearing the wind in the branches and the water murmuring down, might for a brief minute grasp the land's unchangeable wild majesty. And on the far side of that little stream was a field of moon-colored flowers that had for Nedda a strange fascination. Once the boy jumped across and brought her back a handkerchief full. They were of two kinds: close to the water's edge the marsh orchis, and farther back, a small marguerite. Out of this they made a crown of the alternate flowers, and a girdle for her waist. That was an evening of rare beauty, and warm enough already for an early chafer to go blooming in the dusk. An evening when they wandered with their arms round each other a long time, silent, stopping to listen to an owl; stopping to point out each star coming so shyly up in the gray-violet of the sky. And that was the evening when they had a strange little quarrel, sudden as a white squall on a blue sea, or the tiff of two birds shooting up in a swift spiral of attack and then--all over. Would he come to-morrow to see her milking? He could not. Why? He could not; he would be out. Ah! he never told her where he went; he never let her come with him among the laborers like Sheila.|$|E

60|$|The World needs {{not be put}} in Mind what Service King James II, Troops did to France {{during the}} War, every Action spoke their Bravery, but the grand Reform that was made upon the Peace was a sorry recompence for their Service. France wou'd not {{entertain}} 'em, and a Halter was their Doom if they return'd Home. This was an odd way of obliging King James; I speak not so much upon my own account, (though I was reduc'd at the same Time) because I had a Sufficiency elsewhere {{to keep me from}} Starving; but it was but a melancholly sight to behold poor Men strolling upon the Road, not knowing which way to direct their Course, and begging Alms through those Towns in which a little before they had Triumph'd in Victory. But the Rod is often thrown away and burnt after the Child is Whip'd. Upon this Occasion it was that I took leave of Mars, resolving to make use of this Interval of Peace, to satisfy an old Curiosity to see England, a Place as yet I never had beheld. Some Acquaintance I had contracted at Dunkirk, made me willing to take Shipping there, besides the hopes I had of decoying a pleasant Gentleman for my Companion, and upon my Arrival I found him in a good Humour, so we set Sail about three in the Morning, and came under North Foreland Point about seven the same Day. The Master of the Vessel, though he was an old Coaster, was not willing to trust himself among the Flats in a dark Moon, so we lay at Anchor all Night, and in the Morning by peep of Day, the Wind being pretty favourable, we weigh'd and pursu'd our Voyage up the River; but being a little too soon for the Tyde, we struck upon a <b>Sand</b> <b>Bed,</b> and oblig'd to remain ther till the Rise of the Water. I was all alone in the Master's Cabin when this Accident happen'd, but being very intent upon a Book, I was not sensible whether we mov'd or stood still. A Lady who was {{with the rest of the}} Passengers upon Deck coming hastily down, Sir, said she. Do you sit quietly here and we are struck upon a Sand-Bed? Madame, said I, I did suppose such a Thing, but the Tyde will cast us off. You suppos'd such a Thing, said she, Why, Sir, we shall certainly be drown'd, come let us to Prayers. I was not very much accustom'd to the Sea, yet I imagin'd there could be no great Danger as long as we had a flowing Tyde, and that it did not blow a Storm: Had the Water been ebbing and a Storm ensu'd upon it, 'tis probable our Ship, being none of the strongest, might have been beaten to Pieces among those Sands. However, I step'd upon Deck to see how Things went; there was a profound Silence every where, the Passengers were scatter'd here and there looking one at another, but not speaking a Word; the Master was walking with his Arms across without Fear, but not without Concern in his Countenance: I ask'd him how he came to be mistaken in the Tyde? he answer'd, Accidents would happen'd sometimes, but there was no Danger. Then running on in a Strain of Sailors Cant, he said, God was at Sea as well as at Land, that the Lord wou'd protect 'em if they did but put their Trust in him, and love him as they ought. In the middle of this moral Lesson, the Ship was gently wafted off the Sands by the Tyde, and Sails being abroad spread, the Ship sail'd merrily along. 'Twas surprizing to observe the Alteration in every bodies Countenance; the Women began to Laugh and Giggle; the Men began to rally one another for want of Courage; the Sailors began to raise their Note higher and higher, and the Master of the Ship turn'd his Sermon into a Volley of Oaths and Curses against his Crew; and thus in an instant, from a profound Silence we recover'd our selves again to Noise and Hurry. That Day brought us to Gravesend, where we took Boat, and so arriv'd safe at London, though I was not very well pleas'd with those small Boats People usually pass in from Gravesend to London, for I understood they were often Overset by sudden Gusts of Wind which blow from the Shoar.|$|E

40|$|Use of {{geosynthetics}} for reinforcing soil beds supporting shallow foundations {{has gained}} tremendous popularity in recent times. In this thesis, {{to study and}} understand the behaviour of geosynthetics reinforced soil foundations, model load tests are carried out on square footings resting on <b>sand</b> <b>beds</b> reinforced with geosynthetics. The effects of various parameters like type and tensile strength of geosynthetic material, depth of reinforced zone, spacing of reinforcement layers, width of reinforcement and form of reinforcement {{on the performance of}} square footings on reinforced <b>sand</b> <b>beds</b> are studied. Results from these tests are analyzed to understand the effect of various parameters in improving the bearing capacity and reducing the settlement of footings. An equation is developed to estimate the ultimate bearing capacity of square footings resting on geosynthetic reinforced <b>sand</b> <b>beds</b> by multiple regression analysis of the experimental data. The model loading tests on reinforced soil foundations are simulated in the numerical model using the computer program FLAC 3 D (Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua in 3 D). Finally parametric studies on a full scale reinforced soil foundation are conducted. From the experimental, analytical and numerical investigations carried out in this thesis, some important conclusions are drawn regarding the effective depth of reinforced zone, optimum spacing and quantity of reinforcement layers. Relative efficiency of various forms of reinforcement is discussed. Validity of the regression and numerical models developed is verified through experimental data from present study and also for data from other researchers...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Inclined heterolithic {{stratification}} (interbedded {{sand and}} mud with depositional dip; IHS) is developed on an in-channel {{bar in the}} tide-influenced, fluvially dominated (brackish water) reach of the Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada. The vertical bar succession {{is characterized by a}} fining-upward profile with an increase in mud content and mud-bed thickness from the shallow subtidal zone to the upper intertidal zone. There is also {{an increase in the number}} and lateral continuity of mud beds from the upstream side to the downstream side of the bar. <b>Sand</b> <b>beds</b> are dominated by current ripples in the intertidal zone, and by current ripples and trough cross-beds in the shallow subtidal zone. The channel base is mantled by downstream (ebb) -oriented dune-scale bedforms. Mud beds are dominantly parallel laminated, although current ripples may develop in silt-rich and sand-rich mud beds. Current-generated bedforms are predominantly ebb-oriented. Sediment deposition is seasonally controlled. Sand deposition occurs during periods of high discharge (snowmelt-induced freshet), and mud is deposited during waning freshet flow and low discharge (base flow). In mud-dominated deposits, current ripples may develop in sand-rich mud beds deposited during the freshet. Seasonal cyclicity in sediment deposition is also recorded in the ichnological characteristics of the IHS. Bioturbation is significantly more common in base-flow deposits (mud beds) than freshet deposits (<b>sand</b> <b>beds).</b> Burrows in <b>sand</b> <b>beds</b> typically subtend from overlying mud beds. Diminutive, vertical burrows dominate the trace suite, reflecting a very low diversity of infauna. Bioturbation is more common on the downstream side of the bar, associated with the thicker and more laterally contiguous mud beds...|$|R

One objective of this work {{was to determine if}} sand-based bedding also supported the microbiologically based suppression of an introduced bacterial pathogen. Bedding samples were collected in summer, fall, and winter from various locations within a dairy operation and tested for their ability to suppress introduced populations of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7. All sources of bedding displayed a heat-sensitive suppressiveness to the pathogen. Differences in suppressiveness were also noted between different samples at room temperature. At just 1 day postinoculation (dpi), the recycled <b>sand</b> <b>bedding</b> catalyzed up to a 1, 000 -fold reduction in E. coli counts, typically 10 -fold greater than the reduction achieved with other substrates, depending on the sampling date. All bedding substrates were able to reduce E. coli populations by over 10, 000 -fold within 7 to 15 dpi, regardless of sampling date. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis was used to identify bacterial populations potentially associated with the noted suppression of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in <b>sand</b> <b>bedding.</b> Eleven terminal restriction fragments (TRFs) were overrepresented in paired comparisons of suppressive and nonsuppressive specimens at multiple sampling points, indicating that they may represent environmentally stable populations of pathogen-suppressing bacteria. Cloning and sequencing of these TRFs indicated that they represent a diverse subset of bacteria, belonging to the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroidetes, Gammaproteobacteria, and Firmicutes, only a few of which have previously been identified in livestock manure. Such data indicate that microbial suppression may be harnessed to develop new options for mitigating the risk and dispersal of zoonotic bacterial pathogens on dairy farms...|$|R
