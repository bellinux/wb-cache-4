40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the appreciation of}} the dollar over the period 1980 - 85. The standard theories try to explain the increased demand for dollar assets by differential rates of return on bonds or by "safe-haven" arguments associated with the lower riskiness of United States assets. Neither of these explanations has proved satisfactory, however, and {{this has led to}} the search for other theories, including non-rational theories such as speculative bubbles and chartism. This paper proposes an alternative explanation, based {{on the role of the}} dollar as a vehicle currency and, in particular, the dominance of interbank transactions. It is shown that, in the years when the dollar appreciated most, changes in banks' assets and liabilities dominated the United <b>States</b> <b>capital</b> <b>account.</b> These were also years when United States banks were locked into large long-term foreign dollar loans to developing countries which, to make matters worse, were highly risky and often required further loans to help service the debt. Since deposits are mainly short-term and loans are long-term, the short-run demand for dollars is inelastic. In our view a decrease in the supply of dollar deposits at various times was a major cause of the dollar's appreciation. A formal model of exchange rate determination, based on the portfolio behaviour of banks, is developed and the predictions are shown to be consistent with the available evidence.

40|$|BACKGROUND:Vascular traumas are {{associated}} with high morbidity rates. OBJECTIVE: To report the characteristics of vascular traumas in the Brazilian state of Pará, in trauma victims treated at the Hospital Metropolitano de Urgência e Emergência (HMUE), from 2011 to 2013. METHOD: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional, retrospective and quantitative study that analyzed data on sex, age group, geographical origin, time waiting for care, mechanism of trauma, clinical status, anatomic site of injury, prevalence of associated fractures, vascular structures injured, types of vascular injury, principal types of surgery, early postoperative outcomes, level of amputation, number of deaths, length of hospital stay and multidisciplinary care for 264 medical records. RESULTS: The majority of victims were male and the most common age group was from 16 to 30 years. The majority of cases were from towns other than the <b>state</b> <b>capital,</b> <b>accounting</b> for 169 cases (64. 02 %). The principal mechanism of injury was firearm wounding - 110 (41. 67 %) followed by cold weapon wounds - 65 (24. 62 %) and traffic accidents - 42 (15. 91 %). The segments {{of the body and}} the vascular structures most often injured were lower limbs - 120 (45. 45 %) and injuries to the popliteal and femoral arteries and veins. The most common clinical presentation at admission was hemorrhage - 154 (58. 33 %). The most common surgeries were ligatures of veins and arteries. There were 163 (61. 74 %) hospital discharges and 33 (12. 5 %) deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The greatest prevalence observed was related to traumas caused by urban violence.

Based on corporate foreign-currency credit ratings data and a novel <b>capital</b> <b>account</b> restrictions index, we find that capital controls can substantially limit access to, and raise the cost of, foreign currency debt, especially for firms without foreign currency revenues.

We find that de jure <b>capital</b> <b>account</b> openness has a robust positive effect on TFP growth. The effect of de facto financial integration on TFP growth is less clear, but this masks an important and novel result. We find strong evidence that FDI and portfolio equity liabilities boost TFP growth while external debt is actually negatively correlated with TFP growth. The negative relationship between external debt liabilities and TFP growth is attenuated in economies with higher levels of financial development and better institutions. <b>Capital</b> <b>account</b> liberalization;Capital flows;Foreign direct investment;Debt;Production growth;Development;Economic models;capital <b>account,</b> <b>capital</b> <b>account</b> openness, economic growth, growth rate, growth accounting, total factor productivity, growth rates, gdp growth, <b>capital</b> <b>accounts,</b> open <b>capital</b> <b>account,</b> <b>capital</b> <b>account</b> restrictions, open <b>capital</b> <b>accounts,</b> business cycle, current account, real gdp, per capita income, national income, business cycle fluctuations, growth rate of output, capital formation, restrictions on <b>capital</b> <b>account</b> transactions, national income accounts, business cycle volatility, <b>capital</b> <b>account</b> transactions, current account balances, per capita income growth...|$|R

40|$|What is {{the effect}} of state {{politics}} on the growth of a state’s charter schools? The academic and policy debate on charter schools largely focuses on the effect of a state’s charter school statutes, specifically the degree of statutory discretion for charter schools, on charter school growth and student achievement. However, we rarely consider the politics in the <b>state</b> <b>capitals</b> that <b>account</b> for the content of a state’s charter school statutes in the first place. I argue that a state’s legislative institutional capacity affects charter school growth by the degree of statutory and regulatory discretion that state lawmakers grant to local school boards of education. In order to verify this argument, I create new quantitative measures of statutory and regulatory discretion to compare the contents of charter school authorization, renewal, and revocation statutes and regulations within and across forty-one U. S. states with charter school laws from 1991 to 2013. The first chapter argues that legislative term limits has a negative effect on statutory discretion. The second chapter demonstrates the interaction of a state’s teacher union strength and the legislative regulatory veto has a positive effect on regulatory discretion. The third chapter argues that statutory discretion has a negative effect on the percent of operating charter schools. Overall, this dissertation demonstrates the effect of legislative institutions on the percent of operating charter schools, the percent of public school students enrolled in charter schools, and the percent of black and Hispanic public school students enrolled in charter schools in a given state...|$|R
