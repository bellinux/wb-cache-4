5|$|London's {{buildings}} are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, {{partly because of}} their varying ages.

Few structures in central London pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, these being a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the City. Further out is, for example, the Tudor-period Hampton Court Palace, England's oldest surviving Tudor palace, built by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey 1515.|$|E
