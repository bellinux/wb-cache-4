The hardware ontology for example specifies all processors, transceivers, smart transceivers, and transmission mediums that are relevant for the LON platform, and the LonMark <b>standardizations</b> ontology defines standardized LonMark profiles, network variable types, and configuration parameter types together with all existing data types.|$|R

After a discussion of regulations, the authors examine the <b>standardizations</b> developed to specify the enabling technologies of TVWS systems.

5|$|As deaf {{education}} and sign language research continued to evolve, {{so did the}} perception of ASL. With {{the publication of the}} Dictionary of American Sign Language, ASL began to be recognized as a legitimate language. The greater acceptance of ASL as a language led to <b>standardization</b> {{and the development of a}} prestige dialect, which was based upon the signs used at Gallaudet University. Despite this <b>standardization,</b> ASL has regional, distinct accents similar to those of spoken languages. Dialects that are different from the standard one, and especially those spoken by marginalized groups, are often stigmatized. As a non-standard dialect, BASL is stigmatized by signers and considered to be inferior to prestige dialects of ASL. This difference in prestige has led BASL speakers to code switch to a prestige dialect when speaking with different groups of people, despite BASL being mutually intelligible with other dialects of ASL.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Sri Lanka became {{independent}} in 1948, about {{sixty percent of}} government jobs were held by Tamils, who formed barely fifteen percent of the population. The elected Sinhalese leaders of the country saw this {{as the result of}} a British stratagem to control the majority Sinhalese, and deemed it a situation that needed correction by implementation of the Policy of <b>standardization.</b>|$|E
5|$|COBOL 2002 {{suffered}} from poor support: no compilers completely supported the standard. Micro Focus {{found that it}} was {{due to a lack of}} user demand for the new features and due to the abolition of the NIST test suite, which had been used to test compiler conformance. The <b>standardization</b> process was also found to be slow and under-resourced.|$|E

5|$|However, the German {{delegation}} {{and others}} rejected the NATO recommendation that 5.7×28mm be standardized, halting the <b>standardization</b> process indefinitely. As a result, both the 4.6×30mm and 5.7×28mm cartridges (and the associated weapons) have been independently adopted by various NATO countries, according to preference; both the P90 and Five-seven {{are currently in}} service with military and police forces in over 40 nations throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 and 2003, NATO {{conducted}} {{a series of}} tests with the intention of standardizing a PDW cartridge as a replacement for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge. The tests compared the relative merits of the 5.7×28mm cartridge and the 4.6×30mm cartridge, which was created by Heckler & Koch as a competitor to the 5.7×28mm. The NATO group subsequently recommended the 5.7×28mm cartridge, citing superior performance in testing, but the German delegation objected and the <b>standardization</b> process was indefinitely halted.|$|E

5|$|Massey and Brown {{introduced}} <b>standardization</b> to the fragmented company. After visiting Pete Harman's {{operations in}} Utah, {{they began to}} implement the stand-alone take-out model across the entire chain. Franchisees were ordered to delist their own menu items {{so that they could}} concentrate on KFC products. The restaurants were re-branded with a distinctive red-and-white striped color pattern and mansard roofs with cupolas. The roll-out of freestanding stores accelerated the company's growth as outlets exclusively selling fried chicken proved to be more appealing to potential franchisees.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus on}} {{portability}} and <b>standardization</b> meant programs written in COBOL could be portable and facilitated {{the spread of}} the language {{to a wide variety of}} hardware platforms and operating systems. Additionally, the well-defined division structure restricts the definition of external references to the Environment Division, which simplifies platform changes in particular.|$|E
5|$|The next {{distinct}} {{period is}} Classical Mongolian, which is dated from the 17th to the 19th century. This is a written language {{with a high}} degree of <b>standardization</b> in orthography and syntax that sets it quite apart from the subsequent Modern Mongolian. The most notable documents in this language are the Mongolian Kangyur and Tengyur as well as several chronicles. In 1686, the Soyombo alphabet (Buddhist texts) was created, giving distinctive evidence on early classical Mongolian phonological peculiarities.|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, {{considerable}} {{progress has been made}} in understanding the molecular mechanisms of the various leukocytes and endothelial cell adhesion molecules (cell adhesion molecules - CAMs) involved in cell-cell and cell matrix interactions. This understanding has opened up a new avenue of novel chemotherapeutic targets and bioassay models for inflammatory diseases. Recently developed in vitro bioassays on leukocyte/endothelial cell adhesions can now offer rapid and inexpensive assessment methods for herbal medicines with claimed antiinflammatory uses. Through the use of these robust in vitro methods, active principles of herbal drugs can also be isolated thereby providing the opportunity of <b>standardizations</b> based on a known chemical standard(s) and pharmacology.

5|$|The {{result of}} this power is {{a high level of}} {{organizational}} and policy <b>standardization</b> among the different local jurisdictions allowing them to preserve the uniqueness of their prefecture, city, or town.
