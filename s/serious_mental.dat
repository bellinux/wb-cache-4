5|$|Lhermitte had {{regularly}} seen {{a psychiatrist}} and was reported to demonstrate <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> issues. She claimed that she was driven to kill her children due to troubles at home (namely, living with an outsider who financially supported the family).|$|E
5|$|The defence {{argued that}} Sheila was the killer, {{and that she}} did {{know how to handle}} guns, because she had been raised on a farm and had {{attended}} shoots when she was younger. She had a very <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> illness, had told a psychiatrist she felt capable of killing her children, and the loaded rifle and cartridges had been left on the kitchen table by Bamber. There had been a recent family argument about placing the children in foster care.|$|E
25|$|Persons {{with mental}} illness, making up about 20% of the population, consume about 33% {{of the tobacco}} used. Persons with <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> illness die 25 years earlier than average, often from smoking related illnesses.|$|E

25|$|Ethnicity: Boydston's study, and all similar {{studies in}} the {{literature}} {{have found that the}} majority of members in N/A and other self-help groups for people with <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> illness in the United States are white.|$|E
25|$|Age: Boydston's {{study found}} {{the average age}} of N/A members {{surveyed}} to be 43.02 years. A study six years later of self-help groups for people with <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> illness, found the average age to be 35.3 years.|$|E
25|$|Hospitalization: Boydston's {{study of}} N/A members found that 42% percent had been hospitalized for {{psychiatric}} reasons. More {{recent studies have}} shown that in self-help groups for <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> illness approximately 60% (55â€“75%) of members had been hospitalized for psychiatric reasons.|$|E

25|$|Olanzapine is used therapeutically {{to treat}} <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> illness. Occasionally {{it can have}} the {{opposite}} effect and provoke serious paradoxical reactions in a small subgroup of people, causing unusual changes in personality, thoughts or behavior; hallucinations and excessive thoughts about suicide have also been linked to olanzapine use.|$|E
25|$|Sex: Boydston's {{study of}} N/A members found {{approximately}} 36% were male, and 64% were female. This ratio, of two (or more) females for every male, has been reproduced {{in all other}} studies of self-help groups for persons with <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> illness, as well as specific studies of Emotions Anonymous groups.|$|E
25|$|Gerontologists have {{recognized}} the very different conditions that people experience {{as they grow older}} within the years defined as old age. In developed countries, most people in their 60s and early 70s are still fit, active, and able to care for themselves. However, after 75, they will become increasingly frail, a condition marked by <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> and physical debilitation.|$|E

25|$|According to Boydston's {{results at}} least 70% of N/A members were employed. This {{is similar to}} a {{specific}} study of Emotions Anonymous that found most of the members were middle class. Other studies of self-help groups for people with <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> illness found most of the members tend to be unemployed, while others found members to be predominantly working class.|$|E
25|$|In 1943 he {{was asked}} by the British {{government}} to join the Colonial Commission on Higher Education. The Commission's remit was to survey the West African Commonwealth countries for suitable locations for the creation of universities. There he acquired a disease, went down with hepatitis, and had a <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> breakdown. He was completely disabled, treated with ECT, and took a full year to recover. He was 55.|$|E
25|$|Finally {{published}} in 1980, the DSM-III was 494 pages and listed 265 diagnostic categories. It rapidly came into widespread international use {{and has been}} termed a revolution or transformation in psychiatry. However, Robert Spitzer later criticized his own work on it {{in an interview with}} Adam Curtis, saying it led to the medicalization of 20-30 percent of the population who may not have had any <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> problems.|$|E
5000|$|Sexual {{objectification}} {{is said to}} primarily {{impact the}} psychological health of women. [...] It is said to negatively affect young women by instilling shame, doubt and anxiety within them through body spectatoring and policing. These effects are said to potentially lead to even more <b>serious</b> negative <b>mental</b> health complexities, such as depression and sexual dysfunction.|$|R

25|$|A {{report of}} Gage's {{physical}} and mental condition {{shortly before his death}} implies that his most <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> changes were temporary, so that in later life he was far more functional, and socially far better adapted, than in the years immediately following his accident. A social recovery hypothesis suggests that Gage's work as a stagecoach driver in Chile fostered this recovery by providing daily structure which allowed him to regain lost social and personal skills.|$|E
25|$|On 13 November 2006, Bryant {{was moved}} into Hobart's Wilfred Lopes Centre, a secure mental health unit {{run by the}} Tasmanian Department of Health and Human Services. The 35-bed unit for inmates with <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> illness is staffed with doctors, nurses, and other support workers. Inmates are not locked down and can come and go from their cells. Exterior {{security}} at the facility is provided by a three-wall perimeter patrolled by private contract guards.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, US {{president}} John F. Kennedy {{introduced legislation}} delegating the National Institute of Mental Health to administer Community Mental Health Centers for those being discharged from state psychiatric hospitals. Later, though, the Community Mental Health Centers focus shifted to providing psychotherapy for those suffering from acute but less <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> disorders. Ultimately {{there were no}} arrangements made for actively following and treating severely mentally ill patients who were being discharged from hospitals, resulting in a large population of chronically homeless people suffering from mental illness.|$|E

40|$|Engagement {{with mental}} health {{services}} is important if people with <b>serious,</b> long-standing <b>mental</b> health problems are to be adequately supported in the community. However, engagement of this client group is notoriously difficult. While {{research is needed to}} address reasons for disengagement, there are no existing measures of the engagement concept. This paper presents the development of an observer-rated, multi-item engagement measure, together with evidence in support of its reliability and validity. The measure is quick and easy to use, with significant clinical and research value...|$|R
25|$|Today the on-site {{facilities}} {{have been reduced}} from {{what was once the}} world's largest asylum, although it is still used for treatment of and research into <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> distress. A prior trust created the London West Mental Health R Consortium which also has its administrative base there. There is now a complex of other buildings known as Ealing Hospital NHS Trust built on the old asylum's recreational grounds and cycle track to the east. At the back of the main building are some disused wards that still belong to the Regional Health Authority.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the deaths}} {{associated}} with Tasers are given a diagnosis of excited delirium, a term for a phenomenon that manifests as a combination of delirium, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, hallucinations, speech disturbances, disorientation, violent and bizarre behavior, insensitivity to pain, elevated body temperature, and increased strength. Excited delirium is associated with sudden death (usually via cardiac or respiratory arrest) particularly following the use of physical control measures, including police restraint and Tasers. Excited delirium most commonly arises in male subjects {{with a history of}} <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> illness and/or acute or chronic drug abuse, particularly stimulant drugs such as cocaine. Alcohol withdrawal or head trauma may also contribute to the condition.|$|E
25|$|Even as {{clinical}} psychology was growing, working {{with issues of}} <b>serious</b> <b>mental</b> distress remained the domain of psychiatrists and neurologists. However, clinical psychologists continued to make inroads into this area due to their increasing skill at psychological assessment. Psychologists' reputation as assessment experts became solidified during World War I {{with the development of}} two intelligence tests, Army Alpha and Army Beta (testing verbal and nonverbal skills, respectively), which could be used with large groups of recruits. Due {{in large part to the}} success of these tests, assessment was to become the core discipline of {{clinical psychology}} for the next quarter century, when another war would propel the field into treatment.|$|E
50|$|Though Health and Stability are general abilities, they {{function}} differently. While other abilities are exhausted once they reach 0, Health and Stability can reach negative numbers. This represents <b>serious</b> injury or <b>mental</b> illness. If either ability reaches âˆ’12, the player character has died or gone permanently insane.|$|R

5000|$|The Fairweather Lodge Program was {{developed}} by psychologist George Fairweather in California in 1963.
