60|$|For the {{moonlight}} this evening was almost solid, seeming with its cool still vibration {{to replace the}} very air; in it the war-time precautions against light seemed fantastic, like shading candles in a room still full of daylight. What lights there were {{had the effect of}} strokes and <b>stipples</b> of dim colour laid by a painter's brush on a background of ghostly whitish blue. The dreamlike quality of the town was perhaps enhanced for her eyes by the veil she was wearing--in daytime no longer white. As the music died out of her, elation also ebbed. Somebody had passed her, speaking German, and she was overwhelmed by a rush of nostalgia. On this moonlight night by the banks of the Rhine--whence she came--the orchards would be heavy with apples; there would be murmurs, and sweet scents; the old castle would stand out clear, high over the woods and the chalky-white river. There would be singing far away, and the churning of a distant steamer's screw; and perhaps on the water a log raft still drifting down in the blue light. There would be German voices talking. And suddenly tears oozed up in her eyes, and crept down through the powder on her cheeks. She raised her veil and dabbed at her face with a little, not-too-clean handkerchief, screwed up in her yellow-gloved hand. But the more she dabbed, the more those treacherous tears ran. Then she became aware that a tall young man in khaki was also standing before the shop-window, not looking at the titles of the books, but eyeing her askance. His face was fresh and open, with a sort of kindly eagerness in his blue eyes. Mechanically she drooped her wet lashes, raised them obliquely, drooped them again, and uttered a little sob....|$|E

50|$|Verbesina occidentalis {{has been}} shown to be one of the plants that is {{sensitive}} to the rising ozone levels. Due to the rising of ozone levels Verbesina occidentalis {{has been shown}} to have foliar ozone injury. Foliar ozone injury results in visible damage to the plant. Foliar ozone injury tends to be worse in more sun exposed leaves. In the Smokey Mountain National Park approximately fifty percent of the plants sampled showed symptoms of foliar ozone injury. Approximately seventeen percent of the leaves sampled were injured. The percent of plants injured increases as the elevation increases. The stippling may become more prominent in late summer. It may begin as a few <b>stipples</b> that are angular in shape. The coloring of the stippling may range from a light reddish-purple to black. In prolonged cases the leaves will become yellow color and may eventually die.|$|E
50|$|He renders {{his work}} {{through a process}} of {{stippling}} done with very precise rapidograph technical pens; his pieces are done without any preliminary drawings, and with no lines to guide the composition. As Benefiel states, 'There was no need to stay in the lines, because there are no lines.' In his representational drawings, Benefiel works from the center outward, and in his drawings of rows of numbers he <b>stipples</b> the characters from left to right as they would appear on a typed or printed page. As he draws, he counts the dots until a certain point, then repeats the sequence. Once the dots are complete, Benefiel tones the paper with tea, to add visual depth as well as a look of age. The idea of this method is to provide an exceptional degree of incremental control where possibilities for spontaneity and error are all but erased, to aesthetically resemble photographic grain, and to serve and complement his obsessive-compulsive disposition. He also produces pictures with figures reminiscent of a giant sized child's doll, often positioned in the centre of a piece and surround by numbers.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} example-based {{approach}} to synthesizing <b>stipple</b> illustrations for static 2 D images that produces scale-dependent results appropriate for an intended spatial output size and resolution. We show how treating <b>stippling</b> as a grayscale process {{allows us to}} both produce on-screen output and to achieve <b>stipple</b> merging at medium tonal ranges. At {{the same time we}} can also produce images with high spatial and low color resolution for print reproduction. In addition, we discuss how to incorporate high-level illustration considerations into the <b>stippling</b> process based on discussions with and observations of a <b>stipple</b> artist. Also, certain features such as edges can be extracted and used to control the placement of dots to improve the result. The implementation of the technique is based on a fast method for distributing dots using halftoning and can be used to create <b>stipple</b> images interactively. We describe both a GPU implementation of the basic algorithm that creates <b>stipple</b> images in real-time for large images and an extended CPU method that allows a finer control of the output at interactive rates. ...|$|R

50|$|Known from subfossil {{bones and}} the {{writings}} of Dubois published in 1674, this bird was larger than its relative F. punctatus on Mauritius, being {{about the size of}} a common kestrel, or around 35 cm from head to tail, with males being noticeably smaller than females. This trait, while present in most birds of prey, is most pronounced in the larger, bird-eating species and reduces between-sex competition by niche differentiation. It can be assumed that the bird was of the same generally brownish coloration as its closest relatives, with a lighter underside and darker spots or <b>stipples,</b> the tail, brown or more probably grey, being banded and tipped black. Its feet were yellow and large relative to the bird's overall size. The wingspan was 60-70 cm, its wings being more rounded than those of the common kestrel - just as in the Mauritius bird - for increased maneuvrability when hunting in the forest. It is probable, but not certain, that the only difference between the sexes was their size. The bird fed mainly on birds, but certainly also on insects and the local gecko; Dubois noted that despite their small size they were able to prey on (presumably half-grown) domestic chickens.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} rendering color videos using a non-photo-realistic art form technique commonly called <b>stippling.</b> <b>Stippling</b> {{is the art}} of rendering images using point sets, possibly with various attributes like sizes, elementary shapes, and colors. Producing nice <b>stippling</b> is attractive not only for the sake of image depiction but also because it yields a compact vectorial format for storing the semantic information of media. Moreover, <b>stippling</b> is by construction easily tunable to various device resolutions without suffering from bitmap sampling artifacts when resizing. The underlying core technique for <b>stippling</b> images is to compute a centroidal Voronoi tessellation on a well-designed underlying density. This density relates to the image content, and is used to compute a weighted Voronoi diagram. By considering videos as image sequences and initializing properly the <b>stippling</b> of one image by the result of its predecessor, one avoids undesirable point flickering artifacts and can produce <b>stippled</b> videos that nevertheless still exhibit noticeable artifacts. To overcome this, our method improves over the naive scheme by considering dynamic point creation and deletion according to the current scene semantic complexity, and show how to effectively vectorize video while adjusting for both color and contrast characteristics. Furthermore, we explain how to produce high quality <b>stippled</b> ``videos'' (eg., fully dynamic spatio-temporal point sets) for media containing various fading effects, like quick motions of objects or progressive shot changes. We report on practical performances of our implementation, and present several <b>stippled</b> video results rendered on-the-fly using our viewer that allows both spatio-temporal dynamic rescaling (eg., upscale vectorially frame rate).

[...] "The degree of keratinization and the prominence of <b>stippling</b> appear to be related."

40|$|We {{present a}} fast {{hardware-accelerated}} <b>stippling</b> method {{which does not}} require any preprocessing for placing points on surfaces. The surfaces are automatically parameterized in order to apply <b>stippling</b> textures without major distortions. The mapping process is guided by a decomposition of the space in cubes. Seamless scaling with a constant density of points is realized by subdividing and summarizing cubes. Our mip-map technique enables arbitrarily scaling with one texture. Different shading tones and scales are facilitated by adhering to the constraints of tonal art maps. With our <b>stippling</b> technique, it is feasible to encode all scaling and brightness levels within one self-similar texture. Our method is applied to surfaces extracted from (segmented) medical volume data. The speed of the <b>stippling</b> process enables <b>stippling</b> for several complex objects simultaneously. We consider application scenarios in intervention planning (neck and liver surgery planning).
