5|$|The uterine cycle {{has three}} phases: menses, proliferative, <b>secretory.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>secretory</b> {{phase is}} {{the final phase of}} the uterine cycle and it {{corresponds}} to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. During the <b>secretory</b> phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the endometrium receptive to implantation of the blastocyst and supportive of the early pregnancy, by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing the contractility of the smooth muscle in the uterus; it also has the side effect of raising the woman's basal body temperature.|$|E
5|$|Chloride (Cl−) and {{hydrogen}} (H+) ions are secreted separately {{in the stomach}} fundus region {{at the top of}} the stomach by parietal cells of the gastric mucosa into a <b>secretory</b> network called canaliculi before it enters the stomach lumen.|$|E
5|$|Once <b>secretory</b> {{proteins}} are formed, the ER membrane separates {{them from}} the proteins that {{will remain in the}} cytosol. <b>Secretory</b> proteins depart from the ER enfolded in the membranes of vesicles that bud like bubbles from the transitional ER. These vesicles in transit {{to another part of the}} cell are called transport vesicles. An alternative mechanism for transport of lipids and proteins out of the ER are through lipid transfer proteins at regions called membrane contact sites where the ER becomes closely and stably associated with the membranes of other organelles, such as the plasma membrane, Golgi or lysosomes.|$|E
5|$|The nerves {{also carry}} sensory {{information}} from the mucous membranes of the larynx below the lower surface of the vocal fold, as well as sensory, <b>secretory</b> and motor fibres to the cervical segments of the esophagus and the trachea.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to making <b>secretory</b> proteins, the rough ER makes membranes that grows in place from {{the addition of}} proteins and phospholipids. As polypeptides intended to be membrane proteins grow from the ribosomes, they are inserted into the ER membrane itself and are kept there by their hydrophobic portions. The rough ER also produces its own membrane phospholipids; enzymes built into the ER membrane assemble phospholipids. The ER membrane expands and can be transferred by transport vesicles to other components of the endomembrane system.|$|E
5|$|L.gigas is {{very often}} parasitized by protists of the phylum Apicomplexa, which are common mollusk parasites. Those coccidian parasites, which are spore-forming, {{single-celled}} microorganisms, initially establish themselves in large vacuolated {{cells of the}} host's digestive gland, where they reproduce freely. The infestation may proceed to the <b>secretory</b> cells of the same organ. The entire life cycle of the parasite typically occurs within a single host and tissue.|$|E
5|$|Primary <b>Secretory</b> Otitis Media (PSOM), {{also known}} as glue ear, {{consists}} of a highly viscous mucus plug which fills the dog's middle ear and may cause the tympanic membrane to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of them. Because the pain and other sensations {{in the head and}} neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers which actually have PSOM and not SM.|$|E
5|$|The MAM {{may also}} {{be part of the}} <b>secretory</b> pathway, in {{addition}} to its role in intracellular lipid trafficking. In particular, the MAM appears to be an intermediate destination between the rough ER and the Golgi in the pathway that leads to very-low-density lipoprotein, or VLDL, assembly and secretion. The MAM thus serves as a critical metabolic and trafficking hub in lipid metabolism.|$|E
5|$|The {{cell lines}} of origin {{are not fully}} understood. The {{mechanism}} may involve abnormal activation of stem cells. In the proximal airways, stem cells that express keratin 5 {{are more likely to}} be affected, typically leading to squamous-cell lung carcinoma. In the middle airways, implicated stem cells include club cells and neuroepithelial cells that express club cell <b>secretory</b> protein. Small-cell lung carcinoma may be derived from these cell lines or neuroendocrine cells, and may express CD44.|$|E
5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} can be {{described}} by the ovarian or uterine cycle. The ovarian cycle describes changes {{that occur in the}} follicles of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the endometrial lining of the uterus. Both cycles can be divided into three phases. The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and <b>secretory</b> phase.|$|E
5|$|Andreacarus voalavo is a {{parasitic}} mite {{found on}} the Malagasy rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus. First described in 2007, it {{is closely related to}} Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus, which are found on other Malagasy rodents. The length of the idiosoma, the main body, is 630 to 670μm in females and 450 to 480μm in males. Unlike A.eliurus, this species lacks distinct sternal glands (<b>secretory</b> organs) between two lyrifissures (sensory organs) on {{the lower part of the}} female body. The pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the chelicera, is serrate, which distinguishes it from A.gymnuromys. Females of A.gymnuromys also have a less ornamented sternal shield (covering part of the underparts) and shorter setae (bristles) on the upperparts.|$|E
5|$|HypSys are {{localised}} in {{the cell}} wall. The precursor for tobacco HypSys is transcribed as a 165 amino acid polypeptide which has no structural homology to the precursor for systemin in tomato. The structural properties of HypSys, containing hydroxyproline and being glycosylated, indicate that they are synthesised through the <b>secretory</b> system. The precursor to HypSys in tomato is a 146 amino acid polypeptide, exclusively synthesised within the vascular bundles of leaves and petioles associated with parenchyma cells of phloem bundles. Unlike systemin, it is primarily associated with the cell wall. The precursors to HypSys appear to represent a distinct subfamily of hydroxyproline-rich proteins found in cell walls. Upon wounding {{it is thought that}} a protease from the cytosol, the cell wall matrix, or the pathogen, processes the precursor producing active HypSys peptides.|$|E
5|$|In endometrioid adenocarcinoma, {{the cancer}} cells grow in {{patterns}} reminiscent of normal endometrium, with many new glands formed from columnar epithelium with some abnormal nuclei. Low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have well differentiated cells, have not invaded the myometrium, and are seen alongside endometrial hyperplasia. The tumor's glands form very close together, without the stromal tissue that normally separates them. Higher-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have less well-differentiated cells, have more solid sheets of tumor cells no longer organized into glands, and {{are associated with}} an atrophied endometrium. There are several subtypes of endometrioid adenocarcinoma with similar prognoses, including villoglandular, <b>secretory,</b> and ciliated cell variants. There is also a subtype characterized by squamous differentiation. Some endometrioid adenocarcinomas have foci of mucinous carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Many {{types of}} cells export {{proteins}} produced by ribosomes {{attached to the}} rough ER. The ribosomes assemble amino acids into protein units, which are carried into the rough ER for further adjustments. These proteins may be either transmembrane proteins, which become embedded in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, or water-soluble proteins, which are able {{to pass through the}} membrane into the lumen. Those that reach the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum are folded into the correct three-dimensional conformation. Chemicals, such as carbohydrates or sugars, are added, then the endoplasmic reticulum either transports the completed proteins, called <b>secretory</b> proteins, to areas of the cell where they are needed, or they are sent to the Golgi apparatus for further processing and modification.|$|E
25|$|<b>Secretory</b> {{cells are}} found in a group, or acinus (plural, acini). Each acinus {{is located at the}} {{terminal}} part of the gland connected to the ductal system, with many acini within each lobule of the gland. Each acinus consists of a single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells surrounding a lumen, a central opening where the saliva is deposited after being produced by the <b>secretory</b> cells. The three forms of acini are classified in terms of the type of epithelial cell present and the <b>secretory</b> product being produced: serous, mucoserous and mucous.|$|E
25|$|<b>Secretory</b> {{proteins}} of eukaryotes or prokaryotes must be translocated {{to enter}} the <b>secretory</b> pathway. Newly synthesized proteins are directed to the eukaryotic Sec61 or prokaryotic SecYEG translocation channel by signal peptides. The efficiency of protein secretion in eukaryotes is very dependent on the signal peptide which has been used.|$|E
25|$|Epithelium – {{innermost}} layer. Responsible {{for most}} digestive, absorptive and <b>secretory</b> processes.|$|E
25|$|Diode laser cycloablation lowers IOP by {{reducing}} aqueous secretion by destroying <b>secretory</b> ciliary epithelium.|$|E
25|$|Despite being a much conserved {{structure}} throughout evolution, {{there are}} some differences on the SCO from different mammals. It is the first <b>secretory</b> structure to differentiate and remains fully developed and functional during the life of almost every vertebrate, excluding bats, anthropoid apes and humans. More specifically, in humans, the SCO development has a regressive nature. It reaches its apex development in fetus from 3 to 5 month old, functioning as a fully active <b>secretory</b> structure of the brain during this time span, and extending from the pineal recess over the posterior commissure to the mesocoelic recess. It is composed by a characteristic high columnar epithelium, which is {{not found in the}} adult SCO. Following this maxed developed state, the SCO starts regressing and in children from 3 to 4 years old it already has a vestigial character, being reduced to islet like structures on the adult. Although the remaining cells can possess some <b>secretory</b> material the SCO is truly vestigial in both structure and <b>secretory</b> function, in adults.|$|E
25|$|Bile salt {{malabsorption}} (primary {{bile acid}} diarrhea) where excessive bile acids in the colon produce a <b>secretory</b> diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{possible}} to distinguish forms of IgA based upon their location - serum IgA vs. <b>secretory</b> IgA.|$|E
25|$|Weaknesses: This model cannot easily {{explain the}} {{observation}} of fused Golgi networks, tubular connections among cisternae, and differing kinetics of <b>secretory</b> cargo exit.|$|E
25|$|Darker-staining cells form {{clusters}} called acini, {{which are}} arranged in lobes separated by a thin fibrous barrier. The <b>secretory</b> cells of each acinus surround a small intercalated duct. Because of their <b>secretory</b> function, these cells have many small granules of zymogens that are visible. The intercalated ducts drain into larger ducts within the lobule, and finally interlobular ducts. The ducts are lined by a single layer of columnar epithelium. With increasing diameter, several layers of columnar cells may be seen.|$|E
25|$|In {{collaboration}} with J.K. Kim and others, he {{showed that the}} luteal phase of the human menstrual cycle is the reabsorptive phase, and not the <b>secretory</b> phase.|$|E
25|$|Marine Academy Old Boys Association (MAcOBA) is an alumni {{association}} {{formed by}} the graduates of Pakistan Marine Academy. It was formed in 1970 when sixth batch graduated. All the graduates of the institution from the two years degree program become {{the part of the}} Association and are referred as Marine Academy Old Boys (MAcOBs). The association is led by President, Vice-President, General <b>Secretory,</b> Joint <b>Secretory</b> and executive members. The fresh graduates of the Academy work voluntarily for the association and are referred as the Task Force.|$|E
25|$|The {{significantly}} increased amount of calcium ions in the cells' cytoplasm causes the release {{into the blood}} of previously synthesized insulin, which has been stored in intracellular <b>secretory</b> vesicles.|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal causes: {{the distal}} tractus digestivus secretes {{high levels of}} magnesium. Therefore, <b>secretory</b> {{diarrhea}} can cause hypomagnesemia. Thus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, Whipple's disease and celiac sprue can all cause hypomagnesemia.|$|E
25|$|The rich vascularization of the SCO {{was first}} {{reported}} by Pesonen (1940). In 1959, Helmut Hofer postulated that this organ, despite its structural and functional differences, {{is a highly}} <b>secretory</b> component of the circumventricular system.|$|E
25|$|The {{signal peptide}} {{is thought to}} have a role in the secretion, folding and {{stability}} of the ADAMTS13 protein. It interacts with membrane phospholipids and protein components of the <b>secretory</b> machinery within the cells.|$|E
25|$|The goblet cell {{is highly}} {{polarized}} with the nucleus and other organelles concentrated {{at the base}} of the cell and <b>secretory</b> granules containing mucin, at the apical surface. The apical plasma membrane projects microvilli to give an increased surface area for secretion.|$|E
25|$|Astroviruses cause {{gastroenteritis}} by causing {{destruction of}} the intestinal epithelium, leading to the inhibition of usual absorption mechanism, loss of <b>secretory</b> functions, and decrease in epithelial permeability in the intestines. Inflammatory responses were seen to not {{have an impact on}} astrovirus pathogenesis.|$|E
25|$|In IgA2, {{the heavy}} and light chains are not linked with disulfide, but with noncovalent bonds. In <b>secretory</b> lymphoid tissues (e.g., gut-associated lymphoid tissue, or GALT), {{the share of}} IgA2 {{production}} is larger than in the non-secretory lymphoid organs (e.g. spleen, peripheral lymph nodes).|$|E
25|$|The {{stomach is}} {{surrounded}} by parasympathetic (stimulant) and sympathetic (inhibitor) plexuses (networks of blood vessels and nerves in the anterior gastric, posterior, superior and inferior, celiac and myenteric), which regulate both the <b>secretory</b> activity of the stomach and the motor (motion) activity of its muscles.|$|E
25|$|Polymeric IgA (mainly the <b>secretory</b> dimer) is {{produced}} by plasma cells in the lamina propria adjacent to mucosal surfaces. It binds to the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells, and is taken up into the cell via endocytosis. The receptor-IgA complex passes through the cellular compartments before being secreted on the luminal surface of the epithelial cells, still attached to the receptor. Proteolysis of the receptor occurs, and the dimeric IgA molecule, along with {{a portion of the}} receptor known as the <b>secretory</b> component, are free to diffuse throughout the lumen. In the gut, IgA can bind to the mucus layer covering the epithelial cells. In this way, a barrier capable of neutralizing threats before they reach the epithelial cells is formed.|$|E
