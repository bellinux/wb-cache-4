2500|$|Comic Jumper was {{revealed}} on September 4, 2009 at PAX. Joystiq interviewed Twisted Pixel's Mike Wilford who cited Final Fight as {{an inspiration for}} melee combat, while Contra and Gunstar Heroes served as inspirations for gun sequences, and said the humor as akin to Earthworm Jim. Wilford further stated [...] "Back in the day, {{there seemed to be}} a whole lot of mascot-type characters in games, like Mario, Sonic, all those things, and not many devs <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> that anymore. We're trying to bring that back a little bit with our games." [...] Comic Jumper is the brainchild of Josh Bear, co-founder and director at Twisted Pixel. [...] Wilford stated that Bear had the idea for the game beginning in seventh grade. It was released for the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Arcade Marketplace on October 6, 2010 as part of Microsoft's Game Feast promotion.|$|E
2500|$|Ryan's {{first film}} release of 2008 was The Deal, a satirical comedy film based on Peter Lefcourt's 1991 {{novel of the}} same title about Hollywood. Directed by Steven Schachter and co-starring William H. Macy, the film was shot in Cape Town and other South African {{locations}} and celebrated its world premiere at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. Garnering generally mixed to negative reviews, it failed to draw interest among film studios, resulting in a straight-to-DVD release in January 2009. In his review for Variety, Peter Debruge said, [...] "The characters <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> all the laughing, while the general public has nothing to cling to but the horndog flirtation between mismatched leads William H. Macy and Meg Ryan—hardly ideal ingredients for mainstream success." [...] Ryan also starred in George Gallo's My Mom's New Boyfriend, shot in 2006 but released direct-to-DVD in 2008. Co-starring Colin Hanks, Selma Blair, and Antonio Banderas, the action comedy received overwhelmingly negative reviews, with David Nusair of Reel Film noting it [...] "an unmitigated disaster virtually from its opening frames".|$|E
