5|$|Historically, <b>solvent-based</b> lubricants, such as {{diesel fuel}} and kerosene, were {{commonly}} used. These were good at releasing the {{part from the}} dies, but a small explosion occurred during each shot, {{which led to a}} build-up of carbon on the mold cavity walls. However, they were easier to apply evenly than water-based lubricants.|$|E

25|$|A {{common use}} of sodium {{hydroxide}} {{is in the}} production of parts washer detergents. Parts washer detergents based on sodium hydroxide {{are some of the most}} aggressive parts washer cleaning chemicals. The sodium hydroxide-based detergents include surfactants, rust inhibitors and defoamers. A parts washer heats water and the detergent in a closed cabinet and then sprays the heated sodium hydroxide and hot water at pressure against dirty parts for degreasing applications. Sodium hydroxide used in this manner replaced many <b>solvent-based</b> systems in the early 1990s when trichloroethane was outlawed by the Montreal Protocol. Water and sodium hydroxide detergent-based parts washers are considered to be an environmental improvement over the <b>solvent-based</b> cleaning methods.|$|E
25|$|Specific {{industrial}} {{techniques to}} produce large single crystals (called boules) include the Czochralski {{process and the}} Bridgman technique. Other less exotic methods of crystallization may be used, depending on the physical properties of the substance, including hydrothermal synthesis, sublimation, or simply <b>solvent-based</b> crystallization.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{limitations}} of the Arrhenius definition is its reliance on water solutions. Edward Curtis Franklin studied the acid–base reactions in liquid ammonia in 1905 and pointed out the similarities to the water-based Arrhenius theory. Albert F. O. Germann, working with liquid phosgene, , formulated the <b>solvent-based</b> theory in 1925, thereby generalizing the Arrhenius definition to cover aprotic solvents.|$|E
25|$|SolarPrint {{was founded}} in Ireland in 2008 by Dr. Mazhar Bari, Andre Fernon and Roy Horgan. SolarPrint was the first Ireland-based {{commercial}} entity involved in the manufacturing of PV technology. SolarPrint's innovation was {{the solution to the}} <b>solvent-based</b> electrolyte which to date has prohibited the mass commercialisation of DSSC. The company went into receivership in 2014 and was wound up.|$|E
25|$|Preliminary {{calculations}} {{have shown}} that utilization of PEF technology would only account for $0.10 per gallon of algae derived biofuel produced. In comparison, conventional drying and <b>solvent-based</b> extractions account for $1.75 per gallon. This inconsistency between costs {{can be attributed to}} the fact that algal drying generally accounts for 75% of the extraction process. Although a relatively new technology, PEF has been successfully used in both food decomtamination processes as well as waste water treatments.|$|E
25|$|The first Asian-owned company {{involved}} in the oil sands was JACOS, which in 1978 began participating in experiments at a pilot project in the Athabasca area. Like Imperial at Cold Lake, from 1984 to 1994 JACOS and its partners also experimented with a cyclic steam stimulation pilot project on the Hangingstone Lease. Since then the company has developed SAGD production on that lease. It is also constructing a demonstration plant using <b>solvent-based</b> in situ bitumen extraction.|$|E
500|$|Water-based lubricants, called emulsions, are {{the most}} [...] used type of lubricant, because of health, environmental, and safety reasons. Unlike <b>solvent-based</b> lubricants, if water is {{properly}} treated to remove all minerals from it, it will not leave any by-product in the dies. If the water is not properly treated, then the minerals can cause surface defects and discontinuities. There are four types of water-based lubricants: oil in water, water in oil, semi-synthetic, and synthetic. Oil in water is the best, because when the lubricant is applied, the water cools the die surface by evaporating while depositing the oil, which helps release the shot. A common mixture {{for this type of}} lubricants is thirty parts water to one part oil, however in extreme cases a ratio of 100:1 is used.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{of their}} small, tunable pore sizes and high void fractions, MOFs are a {{promising}} potential material {{for use as}} an adsorbent to capture CO2.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{adhesives}} that harden by drying: <b>solvent-based</b> adhesives and polymer dispersion adhesives, also known as emulsion adhesives. <b>Solvent-based</b> adhesives are a mixture of ingredients (typically polymers) dissolved in a solvent. White glue, contact adhesives and rubber cements are members of the drying adhesive family. As the solvent evaporates, the adhesive hardens. Depending on the chemical composition of the adhesive, they will adhere to different materials to greater or lesser degrees.|$|E

50|$|Acrylic Paintings were {{introduced}} in the 1950s and the material differs from oil paint in chemical and physical properties. There {{are two types of}} Acrylic paints used in acrylic paintings. There is <b>solvent-based</b> and water-based. <b>Solvent-based</b> acrylic paints are soluble in mineral spirits, and water-based acrylic paints are water-soluble. Acrylic paint differs from oil paint in both its quick drying time, and how the paint dries. Acrylic paint dries in as little as thirty minutes, and dries by the evaporation of solvent of water.|$|E
50|$|Paint {{consists}} of three main components: pigments, resins or binders, and water or solvents. Pigments are finely grounded materials that give out colors or block out the surface beneath it. They may contain other materials such as UV stabilizer, and fillers which bring out the color pigments to the required level. Resins or binders are the glue of the paint to bind pigment and glass beads together to the road surface. The resins for the water-based paints are polyvinyl acetate latex, methyl methacrylate or acrylic resin. The resins for <b>solvent-based</b> paints are linseed or soya oils and alkyd resins. The pigments and resins are mixed with water for water-based paints and solvents for <b>solvent-based</b> paints {{so that they can}} be applied onto the road surface. Solvents that are use can be naphtha, toluene, methanol, methylene chloride, and acetone. Due to environmental concerns, some jurisdictions has some restriction on the <b>solvent-based</b> paints.|$|E
