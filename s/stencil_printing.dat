25|$|The major {{technical}} {{difference between}} Edo and Kamigata prints is the latter's use of kappazuri <b>stencil</b> <b>printing,</b> where colours were brushed onto paper {{with the aid}} of paper stencil patterns. This developed in Osaka around the same time as nishiki-e appeared in Edo. Also distinctive about kamigata-e is that its producers were not professional artists like their Edo counterparts. Instead, they were talented amateurs whose artistic interests were secondary to their passion for kabuki and its actors.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stencil</b> <b>printing</b> is {{the process}} of {{depositing}} solder paste on the printed wiring boards (PWBs) to establish electrical connections. It is immediately followed by the component placement stage. The equipment and materials used in this stage are stencil, solder paste, and a printer.|$|E
50|$|The <b>stencil</b> <b>printing</b> {{function}} is achieved through a single material namely solder paste {{which consists of}} solder metal and flux. Paste also acts as an adhesive during component placement and solder reflow. The tackiness of the paste enables the components to stay in place. A good solder joint is one where the solder paste has melted well and flowed and wetted the lead or termination on the component and the pad on the board.|$|E
50|$|In 1950 Emma Bormann left Shanghai, {{traveling}} across Japan, Hawaii, and the United States back to Europe. In April 1953 a {{solo exhibition}} {{of her work}} {{was held at the}} Austrian State Printing House in Vienna. She would make further visits to Europe, but did not live there again. Beginning in 1953, she resided in Tokyo with her daughter Uta. She made her last woodcuts some time in the late 1950s or 1960s; after this point she no longer had the strength in her arms for carving. She continued to sketch, paint, cut paper silhouettes and took up other media, such as <b>stencil</b> <b>printing</b> and mosaics. She studied and adapted a Japanese <b>stencil</b> <b>printing</b> technique. She made a series of stencil prints showing the dancers and musicians of the Japanese imperial court (performances of gagaku and bugaku). A significant exhibition of her work took place in January 1957 in Tokyo, organized by the Asahi Press Company. In fall 1957 she exhibited in Tokyo at the Japan Art Academy annual exhibition (Nitten) and received an award, significant recognition for a foreign artist living in Japan.|$|E

50|$|The term seriolithograph {{is used by}} Park West Gallery, a major {{publisher}} of graphic editions. The term is used to distinguish a form of hybrid fine art printing technique. Seriolithographs are a combination of lithography (offset, stochastic, photo-mechanical or continuous tone) with serigraphy, a fine art <b>stencil</b> <b>printing</b> technique. Although the term is used by Park West Gallery most commonly, Park West {{is not the only}} gallery that publishes or represents these types of hybrid prints. Fine art prints of this type are published by numerous artists and publishers worldwide, and are widely accepted and collected.|$|E
50|$|Solder paste is a {{material}} {{used in the}} manufacture of printed circuit boards to connect surface mount components to pads on the board. It is also possible to solder through hole pin in paste components by print solder paste in/over the holes. The paste initially adheres components in place by being sticky, it is then heated (along {{with the rest of the}} board) melting the paste and forming a mechanical connection as well as an electrical connection. The paste is applied to the board by <b>stencil</b> <b>printing</b> and then the components are put in place by a pick-and-place machine or by hand.|$|E
50|$|The PWBs are {{designed}} to have fiducial marks on them as reference points. Vision systems in the <b>stencil</b> <b>printing</b> machines use these fiducial marks for aligning the PWB. Without these fiducials the printer would not print the solder paste in exact alignment with the pads. There {{are two types of}} fiducials used namely global and local fiducials. Global fiducials align the printer to the PWB. Local fiducials are required for precise placement of fine pitched components, in the component placement stage. Local fiducial cannot be used in the printing process The entering PWB should have close dimensional tolerances so that it mates to the stencil. This is necessary to achieve the required alignment of solder blocks on the pads.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates a {{wearable}} {{approach to}} facial electromyography (EMG) and electrooculography (EOG). The {{aim is to}} reduce discomfort and setup time in electromyographic research, rehabilitation and computer control. A screen and <b>stencil</b> <b>printed</b> passive electrode network is fabricated on a textile headband. When this headband is worn, an array of <b>stencil</b> <b>printed</b> electrodes makes contact with the skin. The electrodes are connected to external electronics by screen printed flexible conductive tracks. The printed electrode headband is used in a facial electromyographic control system to evaluate performance. The system {{can be used to}} control a mouse cursor or simulate keyboard functions. It was found that 50 Hz noise levels in the printed textile electrodes were similar to commercial disposable electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes. The effect of a wearable approach on pressure variations and motion artefact is examined. The way in which this influences the design and performance of the control system is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Graping {{occurrence}} {{has continued}} to increase since it was first identified in 2006. The viscosity of the flux decreases as {{the temperature of the}} reflow oven increases. Lead-free reflow soldering temperatures are higher which results in more graping. Graping is also caused by increased surface oxidation. The increased surface oxidation is the result of smaller printed paste deposit volumes that cause a diminished surface area to flux ratio of the solder particle resulting in flux exhaustion. While solder paste can be manufactured using any size range however there has been a move towards finer particle sizes especially for fine feature <b>stencil</b> <b>printing.</b> Finer particle sizes places added pressure on the solder paste flux to remove surface oxides which leaves the outside of the joint not fully coalesced producing the irregular surface finish known as graping.|$|E
5000|$|Screenprinting (occasionally {{known as}} [...] "silkscreen", or [...] "serigraphy") creates prints {{by using a}} fabric stencil {{technique}}; ink is simply pushed through the stencil against {{the surface of the}} paper, most often {{with the aid of a}} squeegee. Generally, the technique uses a natural or synthetic 'mesh' fabric stretched tightly across a rectangular 'frame,' much like a stretched canvas. The fabric can be silk, nylon monofilament, multifilament polyester, or even stainless steel (http://awt-gpi.com/product148.htm). While commercial screenprinting often requires high-tech, mechanical apparatuses and calibrated materials, printmakers value it for the [...] "Do It Yourself" [...] approach, and the low technical requirements, high quality results. The essential tools required are a squeegee, a mesh fabric, a frame, and a stencil. Unlike many other printmaking processes, a printing press is not required, as screenprinting is essentially <b>stencil</b> <b>printing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Kamigata-e 上方絵 is {{the term}} used to collectively {{describe}} ukiyo-e prints from Kamigata, the Osaka and Kyoto regions. The earliest documented examples are from a book illustrated by Ōoka Shunboku 大岡春卜 (1680-1763) published 1746. The most popular subject for kamigata-e was kabuki theatre, with single sheet yakusha-e coming into production in the mid-eighteenth century, a full century after the genre debuted in Edo.The major technical difference between Edo and Kamigata prints is the latter's use of kappazuri <b>stencil</b> <b>printing,</b> where colours were brushed onto paper {{with the aid of}} paper stencil patterns.

5000|$|Born in Kanagawa {{prefecture}} in 1959, Hiromitsu {{graduated from}} Nihon University in 1981, and currently operates {{out of the}} Tokyo area. An obvious successor to the ukiyo-e artists of the Edo period in his choice of subject (see yakusha-e, lit. [...] " [...] actor prints"), his methods and style show the strong influence of Yoshitoshi Mori, a <b>stencil</b> <b>print</b> artist whom Hiromitsu's parents served as printers.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the need}} for fine pitch components, as the size of the {{aperture}} becomes smaller and smaller, they become “tall-narrow” apertures. In such cases, the apertures may be filled with solder paste but not completely released, or sometimes not even completely filled and hence get no deposits. In order to counter this problem, aperture walls are made as smooth as possible. Also, molecular layer nano coatings are put on the stencil walls so that the solder paste does not stick. Consistent fill and release is the most important output of <b>stencil</b> <b>printing.</b> When the stencil is down on the board, paste is filling the aperture and it’s in contact with the pad and walls of the stencil. The contact is judged by taking the ratio of these areas i.e. the ratio of the area of the pad to the area of the walls. This is called Area Ratio. The information about the standards for stencil design is available at IPC Specification 7525 and other standards. In general including stencils with tall and narrow apertures, an area ratio greater than 0.66 is recommended.|$|E
50|$|One {{significant}} innovation {{planned for}} the film {{was the use of}} <b>stencil</b> <b>printing</b> for the transition to Technicolor. Each frame was to be hand-tinted to maintain the sepia tone; however, because this was too expensive and labor-intensive, it was abandoned and MGM used a simpler and less expensive variation of the process. During the reshoots in May, the inside of the farm house was painted sepia, and when Dorothy opens the door, it is not Garland, but her stand-in, Bobbie Koshay, wearing a sepia gingham dress, who then backs out of frame; once the camera moves through the door, Garland steps back into frame in her bright blue gingham dress (as noted in DVD extras), and the sepia-painted door briefly tints her with the same color before she emerges from the house's shadow, into the bright glare of the Technicolor lighting. This also meant that the reshoots provided the first proper shot of Munchkinland; if one looks carefully, the brief cut to Dorothy looking around outside the house bisects a single long shot, from the inside of the doorway to the pan-around that finally ends in a reverse-angle as the ruins of the house are seen behind Dorothy as she comes to a stop {{at the foot of the}} small bridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{details of}} the {{fabrication}} sequence vary from group to group. Typically, good quality, CZ/FZ grown c-Si wafer (with ~1ms lifetimes) are used as the absorber layer of HIT cells. Using alkaline etchants, such as, NaOH or (CH3)4NOH the (100) surface of the wafer is textured to form the pyramids of 5-10μm height. Next, the wafer is cleanedusing peroxide and HF solutions. This is followed by deposition of intrinsic a-Si passivation layer, typically through PECVD or Hot-wire CVD. The silane (SiH4) gas diluted with H2 {{is used as a}} precursor. The deposition temperature and pressure is maintained at 200o C and 0.1-1 Torr. Precise control over this step is essential to avoid the formation of defective epitaxial Si. Cycles of deposition and annealing and H2 plasma treatment are shown to have provided excellent surface passivation. Diborane or Trimethylboron gas mixed with SiH4 is used to deposit p-type a-Si layer, while, Phosphine gas mixed with SiH4 is used to deposit n-type a-Si layer. It should be noted that direct deposition of doped a-Si layers on c-Si wafer is shown to have very poor passivation properties. This is most likely due to dopant induced defect generation in a-Si layers. Sputtered Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) is commonly used as a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer on top of the front and back a-Si layer in bi-facial design, as a-Si has high lateral resistance. It is generally deposited on the back side as well fully metallized cell to avoid diffusion of back metal and also for impedance matching for the reflected light. The silver/aluminum grid of 50-100μm thick is deposited through <b>stencil</b> <b>printing</b> for the front contact and back contact for bi-facial design. The detailed description of the fabrication process can be found in.|$|E
