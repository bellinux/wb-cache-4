50|$|The Pacific <b>sand</b> <b>sole,</b> {{belongs to}} the order Pleuronectiformes, and the family Pleuronectidae. They are {{considered}} a flatfish due to their body shape, just like Hippoglossus (halibuts), Solea (soles), and Platichthys (flounders). This fish can get over 62.95 cm (24.78 in) in length and on average this fish can weigh approximately 2.484 kg (5.476 lbs). Their dorsal side, which houses both of their eyes, can {{come in a variety}} of colors like gray, green, or brown, with blotches of dark brown or black. Their underside or ventral side is usually white. By obtaining these colors, the pacific <b>sand</b> <b>sole</b> fish can have a better advantage of camouflaging into their surroundings; making them harder to see by their prey.|$|E

40|$|A habitat {{specific}} {{survey of}} the epifauna and fish fauna of sandbanks off the Welsh coastline was undertaken in 2001. Of these, three sandbanks were considered to represent extensions of shallow nearshore soft-sediment communities, while a further six sandbanks {{were considered to be}} distinct sandbanks; seabed features clearly defined in comparison with surrounding sediments. Multivariate community analyses revealed that the distinct sandbanks had both fish and epifaunal assemblages that were distinct from those sandbanks considered to be extensions of nearshore sediments. The distinct sandbanks were typified by low species diversity and shared indicator species such as the weever fish Echiichthys vipera, the shrimp Philocheras trispinosus and the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus. Differences occurred in species composition among the distinct sandbanks, in particular, southern sandbanks were typified by <b>sand</b> <b>sole</b> Solea lascaris and small-eyed ray Raja microocellata.

Two distinct genotypes were present with sequence divergences of 1 center dot 9 %. and 2 center dot 1 %, in the large Subunit (lsrDNA) and second internal transcribed spacer (ITS- 2) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA), respectively. The less common 'central' genotype was present only off the central area from summer to winter, whereas the 'common' genotype was present throughout the year off the northern and southern areas, but only during spring in the central area, No sequence variation was found within each genotype. The presence of 2 distinct genetic entities was supported by morphological analyses, which showed the 'central' genotype specimens to be more slender and elongate, although morphometric ranges overlapped considerably for most characters. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of 4 of the 3 known genera of the Spathebothriidea showed Spathebothrium to be the earliest branching lineage and the 2 genotypes of Didymobothrium formed a sister group to Cyathocephalus. The concordance of genetic differences with variation in host diet according to season and locality could account for sympatric speciation occurring in the central region of the Portuguese coast...|$|E

It can be found at: [URL] hypoxia along the coast of Oregon and Washington is a seasonal phenomenon that has generated concern among scientists studying this temperate upwelling ecosystem. These waters are affected by coastal upwelling-induced hypoxia mainly during late summer and fall, but the effects of low oxygen levels on fish and invertebrate communities, particularly during the early-life history stages, are poorly known. We investigated the effects of hypoxia and other variables on the species composition, density, vertical and horizontal distribution of fish larvae along the Oregon and Washington coasts during the summers of 2008, 2009 and 2010. Bottom-dissolved oxygen (DO) values ranged from 0. 49 to 4. 79 mL L⁻¹, but the overall water column DO values were only moderately hypoxic during the 3 yr of sampling compared with recent extreme years. In this study, DO was found to be an environmental parameter affecting the species composition, but other variables such as season, year and depth of capture were also important. Although the overall density of fish larvae increased with increasing bottom-DO values, the effect on individual species density was limited. Slender sole (Lyopsetta exilis) and <b>sand</b> <b>sole</b> (Psettichthys melanostictus) were the only species to have a weak trend of density with DO, but both showed negative relationships and neither relationship was significant.

40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. The {{objective}} of this work was {{an assessment of the}} possibility of utilization of selected clay-rich overburden rocks from selected rock raw material found in Polish deposits. For this purpose samples from 12 deposits in five different provinces of southern Poland (Małopolskie, Śląskie, Podkarpackie, Dolnośląskie and Świętokrzyskie) have been collected. Exploited mineral deposits from which samples have been taken belong to wide range of materials. They are for example dolomite (Rędziny), magnesite (Braszowice), limestone (Czatkowice and Morawica), rhyodacites (Zalas), clay materials for construction of ceramics (Harasiuki, Wala Rzedzińska, Kraniec, Wręczyca) and mineral aggregates like <b>sand</b> (Bielany at <b>Sole</b> and Wola Batorska). Main field of feasibility of using samples were components of waterproofing layers. Part of the samples was also tested for the possibility of their use in land reclamation. Mineral and chemical composition of the samples was analysed, using XRD and ICP-OAS methods, respectively. Grain size distribution was performed by using sieve analysis and by a laser particle size analyser. Exchangeable cations and cation exchange capacity were also estimated based on the concentration of displaced ions (such as Ba 2 +, Fe 2 +, Sr 2 +, Al 3 +, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, Na+, K+, Li+) by ammonium cation (from the 1 M ammonium acetate solution) and indicated cations. Results of this study show that none of the tested samples met all the requirements for components of hydro-isolation layer, and therefore they cannot be used for this purpose. In most cases this is an effect of unfavourable mineral composition (to high percentage of non-clay minerals) and/or chemical composition. Usually the amount of examined exchangeable cations was also incorrect. The applicability results for land reclamation showed a very large variation. Part of the samples has acquired the highest A class. However, some samples were also found to be characterized by the worst D class of reclamation utility. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

The average concentration of PCDD/Fs, assessed with the CALUX bioassay, amounted to 64 pg-CALUX-TEQ g(- 1) fat (0. 58 pg-CALUX-TEQ g(- 1) wet weight) {{and that of}} PCDD/Fs + dioxin-like PCBs amounted to 131 pg-CALUX-TEQ g(- 1) fat (1. 18 pg-CALUX-TEQ g(- 1) wet weight). Results of the PCB congeners analyses show that PCB- 153 is the most abundant congener in almost all samples, with also main contributions of the 138 - and 180 -congeners. For some species such as the <b>sand</b> <b>sole</b> and lemon sole, a fairly constant PCB content, independent of the fat percentage, was observed. For a second group of species such as whelks, cod, and whiting, a positive correlation was observed between their PCB concentration (ng g(- 1) fat) and their % of fat. The relationship between marker PCBs and PCDD/Fs concentrations, when plotted on a log scale, fits a straight line (correlation coefficient r = 0. 83). With our results on fish and literature data for other food products, intake of marker PCBs and PCDD/Fs could be calculated for the adult population in Belgium (19 - 60 years old). The Total Daily Intake (TDI) of marker PCBs (ng-PCB day(- 1)) ranges between 1690 and 2210. The TDI of PCDD/Fs (pg-CALUX day(- 1)) ranges between 80. 5 and 122, that of PCDD/Fs + dioxin-like PCBs amounts to 151. When PCDD/Fs in fish are assessed with GC-HRMS, the TDI can be lower. The relative importance of fish regarding marker PCB intake amounts to 15 - 19 %, while regarding PCDD/Fs intake it amounts to 34 - 51 %. Using TDI, the body burden evolution of marker PCBs and PCDD/Fs, with age has been calculated. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2002 Trawl {{surveys of}} four West Coast {{estuaries}} {{were conducted to}} determine the spatial and temporal patterns of juvenile English sole residence during 1998 [...] 2000. Additional data from 1983 [...] 1988 was also analyzed. Juvenile English sole were present in both June and August with densities {{in the range of}} 1000 [...] 2000 fish*ha- 1 across all estuaries. The occurrence of interannual variability in juvenile English sole abundance and the appearance of multiple cohorts in nursery estuaries were addressed by examining transport in the California Current. The larval trajectories for English sole demonstrated that passive larval drift does not account for the patterns in sole distribution in estuaries. In most cases cohorts of English sole larvae were transported north or south off the Oregon-Washington shelf prior to the conclusion of development. However, based on model trajectories, egg stage was carried offshore before hatching in only 6 of 19 cases, and it is suspected that spawn timing occurs during periods of onshore transport to insure that eggs move inshore where they may be retained in local hydrographic features. The relationship of large (TL > 50 -mm) and small (TL < 50 -mm) English sole cohorts to estuarine habitat were also examined. Both small and large cohort English sole utilized lower side channel locations at significantly higher densities than other estuarine areas. Small English sole also showed significant relationships with both bottom temperature and depth. These patterns in habitat use were consistent across all estuaries and indicate that English sole utilized shallow depth areas where temperatures were optimal for growth, and more extensive tidal flats were available. The analysis also indicated a carrying capacity may exist for large English sole in nursery estuaries. The distribution of additional flatfish species was analyzed to examine spatial partitioning of nursery estuaries. The analysis of density anomalies indicated that the four flatfish species were exploiting different sections of each estuary. Densities of sanddab and <b>sand</b> <b>sole</b> were higher in lower main channel sites close to the estuary mouth, that were more oceanic than other parts of the estuary, while starry flounder were more common in the upper sections of the estuary where salinity was typically lower and temperature warmer...|$|E

Claw disorders affect cow welfare and profitability of farms {{and as such}} are important traits relevant to dairy cattle breeding. Aim of this thesis was to increase {{our understanding of the}} genetic {{background of}} claw disorders to enable selection for reduced claw disorder incidence. The claw disorders were: abscess, corkscrew claw, (inter-) digital dermatitis or heel erosion (DER), double sole (DS), hardship groove, interdigital hyperplasia (IH), interdigital phlegmon, <b>sand</b> crack, super-foul, <b>sole</b> hemorrhage (SH), sole injury, sole ulcer (SU), white line separation (WLS), and yellow discoloration of the sole. Data was collected on Holstein cows kept in dairy herds in France. Individual claw disorder frequencies ranged from 0. 1 % to 23. 8 % {{and more than half of}} the trimmed cows had at least one claw disorder in at least one hind leg between 2007 and 2012. Heritabilities were estimated for DER, DS, IH, SH, SU, and WLS, and ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 14. Repeatabilities ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 33. The need for trimming (“trimming status”) was found to be heritable as well with a heritability of 0. 09. A high need for trimming the claws of cows is unfavorable and therefore trimming status is an interesting trait to include in genetic evaluation. Most claw health traits had similar heritabilities and were genetically the same trait in different parities, lactation stages and herds with different trait frequencies. Claw disorder frequency in Montbeliarde cows ranged from 9. 4 % to 41. 1 % and 73 % of the cows had at least one claw disorder in at least one hind leg between 2007 and 2013. Heritabilities ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 09. Heritability for trimming status was 0. 06, confirming that trimming status is a heritable trait. To identify genomic regions associated with claw disorders and trimming status, a genome wide association study was performed. In total, 11 significant and 46 suggestive SNP were detected. Three of the suggestive SNP could be validated using a dataset of genotyped bulls. The detected SNP were spread across the genome and a major gene was not found. In the general discussion, alternative ways of measuring claw disorders were discussed. Accuracy of progeny testing and genomic selection for claw disorders was compared and a breeding program to reduce claw disorders was simulated in order to estimate selection response. Reducing the incidence of claw disorders is achievable with selection, but at a cost of a decrease in production.  ...|$|R
40|$|Tectiviridae {{comprises}} non-enveloped tail-less phages with a double-layer capsid {{where the}} ~ 15 kb linear dsDNA is located within a lipid-containing membrane/vesicle {{covered by a}} rigid icosahedral protein capsid. Upon infection the lipid membrane becomes a tail-like structure used in genome delivery. GIL 01 /Bam 35, GIL 16, AP 50 and Wip 1 are tectiviruses preying on the Bacillus cereus group. These phages also exhibit a strong similarity to the B. cereus linear plasmid pBClin 15. Tectiviruses infecting the B. cereus group are temperate phages able to replicate autonomously as linear plasmids inside the host cell. Despite the significant contributions of phages in different biological processes, {{little is known about}} the relations taking place between tectiviruses and their Gram-positive hosts. Therefore, this work focuses on characterizing the interactions between tectiviruses and the B. cereus group, by assessing their occurrence, genetic diversity and evaluating their host range. To study the occurrence of tectiviruses in the B. cereus group, 2, 000 worldwide isolates, comprising all seven recognized members of this bacterial group, were evaluated using primers designed on two variable regions detected in previously described elements. The first variable region is located within the module that contains replication and regulatory genes (coordinates 3, 162 - 4, 442 in GIL 01), referred to herein as the “RR region”, and codes for the C-terminal end of the DNA polymerase B protein (DNA polB, CDS 5 in GIL 01) and for the N-terminal part of the LexA-like protein (CDS 6). The second variable region is located within the module containing the host recognition and cell lysis genes (coordinates 11, 096 - 11, 838 in GIL 01), herein referred to as the “PL region”, and targets the N-acetyl-muramidase coding gene (mur 1, CDS 26) and partially CDS 27 for which the predicted function is related to the pentameric spike base involved in host recognition. PCR screenings targeting the RR and PL regions, along with propagation tests, revealed that tectiviral elements occurred in less than 3 % of the isolates. Regardless of this limited distribution, 47 novel putative tectiviruses were discovered in the present work, beside the 10 members already known (including <b>Sole,</b> <b>Sand,</b> Sato, Emet and Lima). Overall, these findings (i) expand the view of tectiviral prophages occurrence in members of the B. cereus group, providing evidence for (ii) a greater genetic diversity than previously observed within the Tectiviridae. In addition, analyses of the selected variable regions, along with their host range, showed that tectiviruses in the B. cereus group can be clustered mainly into two different groups: the ones infecting B. anthracis and those isolated from other B. cereus group members. In order to address the host range of some novel tectiviruses, 120 strains, which did not harbor tectiviral-elements, were tested for sensitivity. The results showed that all the tested tectiviruses produced lysis in at least one B. cereus sensu lato strain. Moreover, no simple relationship was found between the infection patterns of the tectiviruses and their diversity. Moreover, the genomic data exposed that diversity and apparent relationships between tectiviruses will differ with the analyzed variable region and if genes are subjected to different evolutionary processes, like recombination. As a consequence, the PL region is proposed to be used in large tectiviral occurrence screenings, whereas the RR region could be used to analyze the bona fide diversity. From an evolutionary perspective, the results indicate that the DNA polB gene has undergone genetic recombination, although the actual contribution of this event remained to be further explored...|$|R
