40|$|Current {{snowboard}} design {{relies heavily}} on riding experience and personal riding style of the board designers along with feedback from professional <b>snow</b> <b>board</b> riders. Snowboard companies are spending {{huge amounts of money}} and time on this unproductive trial and error method of design. As a result, consumers&# 039; choices are limited to the fixed sizes, shapes and structural designs offered by snowboard companies. <b>Snow</b> <b>board</b> enthusiasts seek for an optimal board design using a "Do-it-yourself&# 039; approach. However, sophisticated snowboard design requires a certain level of engineering Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawing and mathematical skill, including complex structural analysis of fabric composites and core materials; and bending and torsional stiffness distribution estimation. Therefore, an advanced design platform is desirable to enable users without engineering backgrounds to design and fully customise their own snowboard. This research is aimed at providing snowboard riders and designers an optimisation and customisation tool for snowboard design. Rather than maximising the performance parameters of a board in every aspect, the optimisation tool provides a solution to optimise the feel of the board to best fit individual use. This greatly reduces the time and cost for riders and even snowboard manufacturers to design a new board and avoid the inefficient trial and error method. Current research employed Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) method and Multiple Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to perform the optimisation tasks and to verify the solutions with each other. The optimisation tasks were implemented through Matlab® and modeFRONTIER®. Based on the results of three case studies, it was found that both optimisation solvers generated similar results on the snowboard performances with different design parameters. The research results were validated with the assistance of two snowboard experts. A Freestyle board and an All-Mountain board were chosen and tested on snow. The experts reviewed and rated the performances/feel of the snowboards based on their riding experience. The obtained data were used to compare with the results generated from the model that developed in this research. The area of validation induded thickness distribution estimation, stiffness distribution estimation, snowboard performance prediction and snowboard design optimisation. This research also developed an advanced interactive parametric design platform which allows user to fully customise and personalise a snowboard in a 3 D virtual environment without any engineering CAD drawing skills, mathematical modelling skills and arduous structural calculations. This design platform offers instant feedback on the <b>snow</b> <b>board</b> performance based on the on-snow performance prediction model obtained from the RMIT snowboard research group. The parametric snowboard design platform contains a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for users to design and personalise their own board by simply altering the geometry and appearance of the virtual board and therefore parametric model. Furthermore, it offers professional riders, snowboard enthusiasts or experienced snowboard designers to "fine tune" the snowboard&# 039;s performance and structural behaviour manually by modifying core materials properties and design parameters of the fabric composite layers of the board. By doing so, an optimal snowboard design can be created so that performance best suits individual use...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 03 The {{frequent}} mid-winter accumulation and ablation {{cycles of}} snowpack within the rain-snow transitional zone {{play an important}} role for the maritime basins along the western U. S. mountain ranges. Representation of transitional snowpack within hydrological models has remained a challenge, largely because surface and meteorological conditions frequently remain near the freezing point, which allows large errors in modeled accumulation or ablation to result from small forcing or structural errors. This research aims to improve model representation of accumulation and ablation processes by utilizing new observations within the transitional snow zone combined with novel methods of model evaluation. The importance of mid-winter snowmelt during historical flooding events was assessed over three maritime basins in the western US. A physically-based snow model was coupled with an idealized basin representation to quantity how the characteristics of each basin combined with storm strength to control the distribution of snowmelt over a basin. Snowmelt contributions to total basin runoff ranged from 7 - 29 % during historic flooding events between 1980 and 2008. However, poor meteorological forcing data were found to be a major limitation in model evaluation. In response to this limitation, a historical snow study site at Snoqualmie Pass within the Washington Cascades was updated in October 2012 with meteorological, soil, and snow observations to provide an ideal site for model evaluation within the transitional snow zone where existing observations are extremely sparse. The data set includes complete meteorological forcing required for snow models: air temperature, total precipitation, wind speed, specific humidity, air pressure, short- and longwave irradiance. Historical (1980 - 2015) observations include <b>snow</b> <b>board</b> new snow accumulation, multiple measurements of total snow depth, and manual snow pits, while more recent years (2012 - 2015) include sub-daily surface temperature, snowpack drainage, soil moisture and temperature profiles, and eddy co-variance derived turbulent heat flux; in short an ideal site to test different hypothesis about snow processes. This unique observational data set was used to illustrate how a novel process-based approach can diagnose model errors in snow accumulation processes (precipitation partitioning, new snow density, and compaction). The main source of model error on each day was identified by comparing observed <b>snow</b> <b>board</b> measurements to a “modeled <b>snow</b> <b>board.</b> ” Results found that even after in-situ calibration, new snow density errors were the most common, occurring 53 % of available days, followed by precipitation partition errors (43 %) and compaction errors (18 %). Daily errors canceled out on annual time scales during all years except the anomalously warm winter of 2014 - 2015. The partitioning of precipitation into rain or snow during water year 2015 was further examined by evaluating surface-based and mesoscale-model-based predictions. Observations of precipitation phase from a disdrometer at Snoqualmie Pass and nearby snow depth sensors were used to evaluate both methods. With calibration, the skill of surface-based methods was greatly improved by using air temperature from a nearby higher-elevation station, which was less impacted by surface inversions at the pass. Without any form of a prior calibration, we found a hybrid method that combines surface-based predictions with output from the Weather Research and Forecasting mesoscale model, to have comparable skill to calibrated surface-based methods. These results suggest that phase prediction in mountain passes can be improved by incorporating observations or models of the atmosphere aloft...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a quality controlled observational atmospheric, snow, and soil data set from Snoqualmie Pass, Washington, U. S. A., to enable testing of hydrometeorological and snow process representations within a rain-snow transitional climate where existing observations are sparse and limited. Continuous meteorological forcing (including air temperature, total precipitation, wind speed, specific humidity, air pressure, short- and longwave irradiance) are provided at hourly intervals for a 24 -year historical period (water years 1989 - 2012) and at half-hourly intervals for a more-recent period (water years 2013 - 2015), separated {{based on the}} availability of observations. Additional observations include 40 -years of <b>snow</b> <b>board</b> new snow accumulation, multiple measurements of total snow depth, and manual snow pits, while more recent years include sub-daily surface temperature, snowpack drainage, soil moisture and temperature profiles, and eddy co-variance derived turbulent heat flux.
