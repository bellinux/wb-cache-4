40|$|ABSTRACT To improve imaging {{systems and}} image {{processing}} techniques, objective image quality assessment is essential. Model observers adopting a task-based quality assessment strategy by estimating signal detectability measures, have {{shown to be}} quite successful to this end. At the same time, costly and time-consuming human observer experiments can be avoided. However, optimizing images in terms of signal detectability alone, still allows a lot of freedom {{in terms of the}} imaging parameters. More specifically, fixing the signal detectability defines a manifold in the imaging parameter space on which different “possible” <b>solutions</b> <b>reside.</b> In this article, we present measures {{that can be used to}} distinguish these possible solutions from each other, in terms of image quality factors such as signal blur, noise and signal contrast. Our approach is based on an extended channelized joint observer (CJO) that simultaneously estimates the signal amplitude, scale and detectability. As an application, we use this technique to design k-space trajectories for MRI acquisition. Our technique allows to compare the different spiral trajectories in terms of blur, noise and contrast, even when the signal detectability is estimated to be equal...|$|E
40|$|The {{landmark}} {{date that}} modern researchers started {{to focus on}} creativity relates to J. P. Guiford’s 1950 address to the American Psychological Association. From then on, investigations mainly focused on individual’s personality traits to identify their associations with creativity. In recent decades, social factors have gradually been defined as playing {{a crucial role in}} creativity. The main four factors on the performance of creative thinking process are: motivation, expertise, sponsorship, and communication skills. The creativity engine is a model that uses the analogy of a combustion engine with inputs (four factors) and creative outputs. The short term memory is refreshed in order to retain information while also supplying cues to enable the effective search of long term memory where <b>solutions</b> <b>reside.</b> In modern design processes, designers often face a design task that relates to fields they are relatively unfamiliar with and the knowledge accumulation they have (long term memory) is not specific to the design task. To compensate for this shortage, an effects database system named “Effect Genius” has been developed and implemented to provide problem related effects and principles to assist designers rapidly access to knowledge guidance from experts at any stage of the design process. A web information gathering and analysis function is also implemented to update the data in the Effects Genius and identify new proposed effects from published data sources. Two case studies were explored to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the Effects Genius system in the idea generation process, which has three steps (keyword conclusion, related effects analysis, and idea generation). Some users also provided feedback on their usages of the system. The comprehensive performance of the example ideas in the two case studies and positive feedback from other users demonstrate that the data gathered by the information gathering system have potential benefits for design tasks and the Effects Genius system indeed stimulates the idea generation process by suggesting design-related effects.

Our solution captures dynamically these effects. Indeed, our transport is capable to cope transparently with wireless links changes (i. e specturm handoff) by adapting dynamically its transmission rate and groups composition.

Soil water is the <b>solution</b> <b>residing</b> in soil pores that is chemically composed of water $(H_ 2 O) $ molecules and dissolved salts molecules (ISSS, 1976).

This suction difference is dissipated through the diffusion of salts and flow of H 2 O molecules (Barbour & Fredlund, 1989). Changes in the dissolved salts concentration of soil water from salt diffusion in response to osmotic suction difference will alter the swell magnitudes of expansive clays, which are strongly influenced by salt concentration (Bolt, 1956; Mesri & Olsen, 1971; Yong & Warkentin, 1975; Mitchell, 1993).
