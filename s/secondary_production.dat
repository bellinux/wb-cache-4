5|$|Production of lead is {{increasing}} worldwide {{due to its}} use in lead–acid batteries. There are two major categories of production: primary from mined ores, and secondary from scrap. In 2014, 4.58million metric tons came from primary production and 5.64million from <b>secondary</b> <b>production.</b> The top three producers of mined lead concentrate in that year were China, Australia, and the United States. The top three producers of refined lead were China, the United States, and South Korea. According to the International Resource Panel's Metal Stocks in Society report of 2010, {{the total amount of}} lead in use, stockpiled, discarded or dissipated into the environment, on a global basis, is 8kg per capita. Much of this is in more developed countries (20–150kg per capita) rather than less developed ones (1–4kg per capita).|$|E
5|$|Smelting, {{which is}} an {{essential}} part of the primary production, is often skipped during <b>secondary</b> <b>production.</b> It is only performed when metallic lead had undergone significant oxidation. The process is similar to that of primary production in either a blast furnace or a rotary furnace, with the essential difference being the greater variability of yields. The Isasmelt process is a more recent method that may act as an extension to primary production; battery paste from spent lead–acid batteries has sulfur removed by treating it with alkali, and is then treated in a coal-fueled furnace in the presence of oxygen, which yields impure lead, with antimony the most common impurity. Refining of secondary lead is similar to that of primary lead; some refining processes may be skipped depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination, with bismuth and silver most commonly being accepted as impurities.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} of America and the plundering of silver by the Spanish conquistadors, Central and South America became the dominant producers of silver until around {{the beginning of the}} 18th century, particularly Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina: the last of these countries later took its name from that of the metal that composed so much of its mineral wealth. In the 19th century, primary production of silver moved to North America, particularly Canada, Mexico, and Nevada in the United States: some <b>secondary</b> <b>production</b> from lead and zinc ores also took place in Europe, and deposits in Siberia and the Russian Far East as well as in Australia were mined. Poland emerged as an important producer during the 1970s after {{the discovery}} of copper deposits that were rich in silver, before the centre of production returned to the Americas the following decade. Today, Peru and Mexico are still among the primary silver producers, but the distribution of silver production around the world is quite balanced and about one-fifth of the silver supply comes from recycling instead of new production.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In this study, we {{examined}} some characteristics of secondary electrons produced by gold nanoparticle (NP) during proton beam irradiation. Method: By using the Geant 4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit, we simulated the NP at the range from radius (r) of 17. 5 nm, 25 nm, 35 nm to r = 50 nm. The proton beam energies used were 20 MeV, 50 MeV, and 100 MeV. Findings on <b>secondary</b> electron <b>production</b> and their average kinetic energy {{are presented in}} this paper. Results: Firstly, for NP with a finite size, the <b>secondary</b> electron <b>production</b> increase with decreasing incident proton beam energy and secondary buildup existed outside NP. Secondly, the average kinetic energy of secondary electrons produced by a gold NP increased with incident proton beam energy. Thirdly, the larger the NP size, the more the <b>secondary</b> electron <b>production.</b> Conclusion: Collectively, our results suggest that apart from biological uptake efficiency, we should take the <b>secondary</b> electron <b>production</b> effect into account when considering the potential use of NPs in proton beam irradiation.

To determine whether <b>secondary</b> metabolite <b>production</b> could be enhanced, Hypericum cell suspensions were exposed to mycelia extract from the fungus Aspergillus flavus. Elicited Hypericum cell suspension cultures displayed reduced growth and viability and a modification of <b>secondary</b> metabolites <b>production.</b> Anthocyanins were only stimulated in fungal-elicited cell suspensions. <b>Secondary</b> metabolite <b>production</b> in elicited Hypericum cells revealed an antagonism between the flavonoid/naphtodianthrone and anthocyanin pathways.

25|$|Copepods {{are usually}} the {{dominant}} zooplankton. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on the planet. The other contender is the Antarctic krill. But copepods are smaller than krill, with faster growth rates, and they are more evenly distributed throughout the oceans.

25|$|Today, {{the main}} source of <b>secondary</b> <b>production</b> derives from copepods. The {{naturalized}} native calanoid copepod Eurytemora affinis {{is believed to have been}} introduced near the end of 19th century. It dominated the zooplankton of the low salinity zone until the 1980s when it was largely replaced by another introduced calanoid copepod, Pseudodiaptomus forbesi. P. forbesi persists by maintaining a source population in freshwater, high-residence regions of the estuary, particularly in the Delta, outside the range of salinity tolerance of the Amur River clam. Because the once-dominant E. affinis lacks an upstream range, it is more vulnerable to predation by the clam, and suffers from apparent competition with P. forbesi.|$|E

Although there are inventories of dioxin emissions from secondary nonferrous metallurgical facilities, release inventories of polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) are scarce. This study selected typical secondary copper, aluminum, zinc, and lead plants to investigate the emissions of PCNs in <b>secondary</b> nonferrous <b>production</b> in China. The toxic equivalency (TEQ) emission factor for PCNs released to the environment is highest for <b>secondary</b> copper <b>production,</b> at 428. 4 ng TEO t(- 1), followed by secondary aluminum, zinc, and lead production, at 142. 8, 125. 7, and 20. 1 ng TEQ t(- 1), respectively. PCNs released in secondary copper, aluminum, lead, and zinc production in China are estimated to be 0. 86, 0. 39, 0. 009, and 0. 01 g TEQ a(- 1), respectively. Analysis of stack gas emission from <b>secondary</b> nonferrous <b>production</b> revealed that less-chlorinated PCNs are the dominant homologues, with mono- to tri-CNs making the most important contributions to the concentration.

Ecologists can broadly group all life forms into one of two trophic layers, the autotrophs and the heterotrophs. Autotrophs produce more biomass energy, either chemically without the sun's energy or by capturing the sun's energy in photosynthesis, than they use during metabolic respiration. Heterotrophs consume rather than produce biomass energy as they metabolize, grow, and add to levels of <b>secondary</b> <b>production.</b> A food web depicts a collection of polyphagous heterotrophic consumers that network and cycle the flow of energy and nutrients from a productive base of self-feeding autotrophs.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we briefly review {{theories}} about the ecological roles of microbial secondary metabolites and discuss the prevalence of multiple <b>secondary</b> metabolite <b>production</b> by strains of Streptomyces, highlighting results from analysis of the recently sequenced Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces avermitilis genomes. We address this question: Why is multiple <b>secondary</b> metabolite <b>production</b> in Streptomyces species so commonplace? We argue that synergy or contingency in the action of individual metabolites against biological competitors may, in some cases, be a powerful driving force {{for the evolution of}} multiple <b>secondary</b> metabolite <b>production.</b> This argument is illustrated with examples of the coproduction of synergistically acting antibiotics and contingently acting siderophores: two well-known classes of secondary metabolite. We focus, in particular, on the coproduction of beta-lactam antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors, the coproduction of type A and type B streptogramins, and the coregulated production and independent uptake of structurally distinct siderophores by species of Streptomyces. Possible mechanisms for the evolution of multiple synergistic and contingent metabolite production in Streptomyces species are discussed. It is concluded that the production by Streptomyces species of two or more secondary metabolites that act synergistically or contingently against biological competitors may be far more common than has previously been recognized, and that synergy and contingency may be common driving forces for the evolution of multiple <b>secondary</b> metabolite <b>production</b> by these sessile saprophytes...|$|R
