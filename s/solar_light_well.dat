40|$|The {{photocatalytic}} {{activity of}} polycrystalline TiO 2 samples impregnated with rare-earth-metal diphthalocyanines was investigated. The 4 -nitrophenol (4 -NP) photocatalytic degradation in aqueous suspension {{was used as}} a probe reaction. Commercial anatase TiO 2 was impregnated with home-prepared double-decker phthalocyanine complexes of the lanthanide metals, such as Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Ho, and Gd. In particular, the impregnation with Ho, Sm, and Nd complexes, acting as sensitizers, proved beneficial for the photoactivity of the studied systems. Significant improvements of the TiO 2 -based catalytic system appeared possible in terms of lower impregnation loading, enhanced photoreactivity under <b>solar</b> <b>light</b> irradiation, as <b>well</b> as chemical, thermal, and photochemical stability of the sensitizers. Enhanced photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 samples impregnated with lanthanide diphthalocyanines in comparison with those impregnated with Cu(II) -porphyrin has been manifested in the decomposition rate of 4 -NP. The phthalocyanine sensitizers proved somewhat less efficient for the disappearance of total organic carbon (TOC) ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experiments}} {{motivated by}} <b>solar</b> <b>light</b> harvesting applications {{have brought a}} renewed interest in AgBiS 2 as an environmentally friendly material with appealing photovoltaic properties. The lack of detailed knowledge on its bulk structural and electronic structure however inhibits further development of this material. Here we have investigated by first-principles quantum mechanical methods models of the two most commonly reported AgBiS 2 crystal structures, the room temperature matildite structure, and the metastable schapbachite. Density functional theory (DFT) based calculations using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation (xc) functional reveal that matildite can be 0. 37 eV per AgBiS 2 stoichiometry unit more stable than a schapbachite structure in bulk, and that the latter, in its ordered form, may display a metallic electronic structure, precluding its use for <b>solar</b> <b>light</b> harvesting. This points out the fact that AgBiS 2 nanocrystals used in solar cells should present a structure based on matildite. Matildite is found to be an indirect gap semiconductor, with an estimated band gap of ∼ 1. 5 eV according to DFT based calculations using the more accurate hybrid xc functionals. These reveal that hole effective mass is twice that of electron effective mass, with concomitant consequences for the generated exciton. Hybrid DFT calculations also show that matildite has a high dielectric constant pertinent to that of an ionic semiconductor and slightly higher than that of PbS, a material that has been extensively used in solar cells in its nanocrystalline form. The calculated Bohr exciton radius of 4. 6 nm and the estimated absorption coefficient of 10 E 5 cm− 1 within the <b>solar</b> <b>light</b> spectrum are <b>well</b> in line with those experimentally reported in the literature...|$|R

This has therefore propelled research in advanced oxidation technologies AOTs to improve the current water treatment methods using cost effective, non toxic and efficient treatment methods. Hence, in this study the sol-gel synthesis method was used to prepare TiO 2 nanoparticles that were photocatalytically active under UV and visible <b>solar</b> <b>light</b> as <b>well</b> as possessing antibacterial properties. Silver and nitrogen doping was carried out to extend the optical absorption of TiO 2. For easy removal and reuse of the photocatalyst the nanoparticles were immobilized on chitosan and poly (vinyl-alcohol-co-ethylene) using the electrospining technique. The synthesized nanomaterials were characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM/EDS, TEM, DRS, and TGA. FTIR and EDS analysis confirmed the formation and composition of TiO 2 nanopowders for the doped and undoped nanoparticles. XRD analysis showed that the anatase phase was the dominant crystalline phase of the synthesized nanopowders. SEM and TEM respectively illustrated the distribution and size of the electrospun nanofibers and the nanoparticles of TiO 2. DRS results showed that there was a significant shift in the absorption band edge and wavelength of Ag-TiO 2 to 397 nm, followed by N-TiO 2 at 396 nm compared to the commercial titania which was at 359 nm. The photocatalytic activities and antibacterial properties of these materials were tested on methylene blue dye and E. coli microorganism respectively. Ag-TiO 2 immobilized on nanofibers of chitosan and PVAE had the highest photocatalytic activity compared to N-TiO 2. Similar results were observed when the biocide properties of these materials were tested on E. coli...|$|R

40|$|Graphite Oxide (GtO) is {{commonly}} used as an intermediate material for preparation of graphene {{in the form of}} reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Being a semiconductor with tunable band gap rGO is often coupled with various photocatalysts to enhance their visible light activity. The behavior of such rGO-based composites could be affected after prolonged exposure to <b>solar</b> <b>light.</b> In the present work, the alteration of the GtO properties under <b>solar</b> <b>light</b> irradiation is investigated. Water dispersions of GtO manufactured by oxidation of natural graphite via Hummers method were irradiated into <b>solar</b> <b>light</b> simulator for different periods of time without addition of catalysts or reductive agent. The FT-IR analysis of the treated dispersions revealed gradual reduction of the GtO with the increase of the irradiation time. The XRD, FT-IR and XPS analyses of the obtained solid materials confirmed the transition of GtO to rGO under <b>solar</b> <b>light</b> irradiation. The reduction of the GtO was also manifested by the CV measurements that revealed stepwise increase of the specific capacitance connected with the restoration of the sp 2 domains. Photothermal self-propagating reduction of graphene oxide in aqueous media under <b>solar</b> <b>light</b> irradiation is suggested as a possible mechanism. The self-photoreduction of GtO utilizing <b>solar</b> <b>light</b> provides a green, sustainable route towards preparation of reduced graphene oxide.

Aeroxide TiO 2 {{was loaded with}} platinum metal via solar photo-deposition method to reduce the electron hole recombination process. Photocatalytic sacrificial hydrogen generation was influenced by several factors such as platinum loading (wt%) on TiO 2, solution pH, Eosin Y to Pt/TiO 2 mass ratio, triethanolamine concentration, and light (UV, visible and solar) intensities. Detailed reaction mechanisms in visible and <b>solar</b> <b>light</b> irradiation were established.
