50|$|Basal plate neuroblasts {{give rise}} to the abducens nucleus, which forms the general somatic efferent fibers (GSE); the facial and motor trigeminal nuclei, which form the special visceral efferent (SVE) column, and the {{superior}} <b>salivatory</b> nucleus, which forms the general visceral efferent fibers of the facial nerve.|$|E
5000|$|Fibers {{from the}} {{hypothalamus}} and olfactory system project via the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus {{to influence the}} output of the inferior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus. Examples include: 1) dry mouth in response to fear (mediated by the hypothalamus); 2) salivation in response to smelling food (mediated by the olfactory system) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{inferior}} <b>salivatory</b> nucleus is {{a cluster}} of neurons in the pontine tegmentum (dorsal part of the pons), just above its junction with the medulla. It is the general visceral efferent (GVE) component of the glossopharyngeal nerve supplying the parasympathetic input to the parotid gland for salivation.|$|E
5000|$|Parasympathetic efferent fibers of {{the facial}} nerve (preganglionic fibers) arise {{according}} to some authors from the small cells {{of the facial}} nucleus, or according to others from a special nucleus of cells scattered in the reticular formation, dorso-medial to the facial nucleus - the superior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus.|$|E
5000|$|Parasympathetic {{innervation}} to the submandibular glands {{is provided}} by the superior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus via the chorda tympani, a branch of the facial nerve, that becomes part of the trigeminal nerve's lingual nerve prior to synapsing on the submandibular ganglion. Increased parasympathetic activity promotes the secretion of saliva.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is a small}} {{collection}} of nerve cells in the dorsal part of pons, just above its junction with the [...] medulla. It lies immediately caudal to the superior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus and just above {{the upper end of}} the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve in the medulla.|$|E
50|$|The cell {{bodies for}} {{the facial nerve}} are grouped in {{anatomical}} areas called nuclei or ganglia. The cell bodies for the afferent nerves {{are found in the}} geniculate ganglion for taste sensation. The cell bodies for muscular efferent nerves are found in the facial motor nucleus whereas the cell bodies for the parasympathetic efferent nerves are found in the superior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus.|$|E
50|$|The {{facial nerve}} also {{supplies}} parasympathetic fibers to the submandibular gland and sublingual glands via chorda tympani. Parasympathetic innervation serves {{to increase the}} flow of saliva from these glands. It also supplies parasympathetic innervation to the nasal mucosa and the lacrimal gland via the pterygopalatine ganglion. The parasympathetic fibers that travel in the facial nerve originate in the superior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the parotid}} and buccal glands, the labial glands are innervated by {{parasympathetic}} fibres {{that arise in}} the inferior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus, travel with the glossopharyngeal nerve and lesser petrosal nerve to the otic ganglion, where they synapse and then continue to the labial glands. Sympathetic innervation is mediated by postganglionary fibres which arise in the superior cervical ganglion and pass through the otic ganglion without synapsing.|$|E
5000|$|The preganglionic {{parasympathetic}} fibres {{originate in}} the inferior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus of the glossopharyngeal nerve. They leave the glossopharngeal nerve by its [...] tympanic branch and then pass via the tympanic plexus and the lesser petrosal nerve to the otic ganglion. Here, the fibres synapse, and the postganglionic fibers pass by communicating branches to the auriculotemporal nerve, which conveys them to the parotid gland. They produce vasodilator and secretomotor effects.|$|E
50|$|The preganglionic nerve fibers {{originate}} in the inferior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus of the rostral medulla and travel anteriorly and laterally to exit the brainstem between the medullary olive and the inferior cerebellar peduncle with the other components of CN IX. Note: These neurons do not form a distinct nucleus visible on cross-section of the brainstem. The position indicated on the diagram {{is representative of the}} location of the cell bodies of these fibers.|$|E
50|$|The {{superior}} <b>salivatory</b> nucleus {{contains the}} cell bodies of parasympathetic axons within the intermediate nerve. These fibers reach the geniculate ganglion {{but do not}} synapse. Some of these preganglionic parasympathetic fibers persist within the greater petrosal nerve as they exit the geniculate ganglion and subsequently synapse with neurons in the pterygopalatine ganglion. These postganglionic neurons send axons that provide parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal gland via a communicating branch from zygomatic nerve to lacrimal nerve of CN V.|$|E
50|$|The {{sympathetic}} ganglia here, {{are found}} in two chains: the pre-vertebral and pre-aortic chains. The activity of autonomic ganglionic neurons is modulated by “preganglionic neurons” located in the central nervous system. Preganglionic sympathetic neurons {{are located in the}} spinal cord, at the thorax and upper lumbar levels. Preganglionic parasympathetic neurons {{are found in}} the medulla oblongata where they form visceral motor nuclei; the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve; the nucleus ambiguus, the <b>salivatory</b> nuclei, and in the sacral region of the spinal cord.|$|E
50|$|The {{parotid gland}} {{receives}} both sensory and autonomic innervation. General Sensory innervation to the parotid gland, its sheath, and the overlying skin {{is provided by}} the great auricular nerve. The autonomic innervation controls the rate of saliva production and is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve.Postganglionic sympathetic fibers from superior cervical sympathetic ganglion reach the gland as periarterial nerve plexuses around the middle meningeal artery and their function is mainly vasoconstriction. The cell bodies of the preganglionic sympathetics usually lie in the lateral horns of upper thoracic spinal segments. Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave the brain stem from inferior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus in the glossopharyngeal nerve and then through its tympanic and then the lesser petrosal branch pass into the otic ganglion. There, they synapse with postganglionic fibers which reach the gland by hitch-hiking via the auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve.|$|E
5000|$|Frey's {{syndrome}} {{often results}} {{as a side}} effect of surgeries of or near the parotid gland or due to injury to the auriculotemporal nerve, which passes through the parotid gland {{in the early part of}} its course. The Auriculotemporal branch of the Trigeminal nerve carries parasympathetic fibers to the sweat glands of the scalp and the parotid salivary gland. As a result of severance and inappropriate regeneration, the parasympathetic nerve fibers may switch course, resulting in [...] "gustatory Sweating" [...] or sweating in the anticipation of eating, instead of the normal <b>salivatory</b> response.It is often seen with patients who have undergone endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy, a surgical procedure wherein part of the sympathetic trunk is cut or clamped to treat sweating of the hands or blushing. The subsequent regeneration or nerve sprouting leads to abnormal sweating and salivating. It can also include discharge from the nose when smelling certain food.|$|E
50|$|The {{parasympathetic}} {{aspect of}} the facial nerve controls secretion of the sublingual and submandibular salivary glands, the lacrimal gland, and the glands associated with the nasal cavity. The preganglionic fibers originate within the CNS in the superior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus and leave as the intermediate nerve (which some consider a separate cranial nerve altogether) to connect with the facial nerve just distal (further out) to it surfacing the central nervous system. Just after the facial nerve geniculate ganglion (general sensory ganglion) in the temporal bone, the facial nerve gives off two separate parasympathetic nerves. The first is the greater petrosal nerve and the second is the chorda tympani. The greater petrosal nerve travels through the middle ear and eventually combines with the deep petrosal nerve (sympathetic fibers) to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal. The parasympathetic fibers of the nerve of the pterygoid canal synapse at the pterygopalatine ganglion, which is closely associated with the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V2). The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers leave the pterygopalatine ganglion in several directions. One division leaves on the zygomatic division of CN V2 and travels on a communicating branch to unite with the lacrimal nerve (branch of the ophthalmic nerve of CN V1) before synapsing at the lacrimal gland. These parasympathetic to the lacrimal gland control tear production.|$|E
40|$|The localizations of the {{inferior}} and superior <b>salivatory</b> nuclei that {{give rise to}} parasympathetic fibers to the parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands were identified in cats by means of the horseradish peroxidase method. The inferior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus exists in the dorsal part of the reticular formation in the medulla oblongata. Although the superior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus has been said to exist in the pons, the nucleus demonstrated in this study does not exist in the pons but does exist in the dorsal part of the reticularformation of the rostral medulla oblongata. Neurons of the <b>salivatory</b> nuclei were medium-sized and multipolar with densely stained Nissl substance...|$|E
40|$|Horseradish {{peroxidase}} {{was applied}} to a ligation of the chorda tympani nerves running alongside the submandibular duct in order to label the preganglionic parasympathetic <b>salivatory</b> neurons in the brain stem. Labelled neurons {{were found in the}} ipsilateral motor trigeminal nucleus, lateral reticular formation and in the facial motor nuclei of both sides. However, the labelling of neurons in the motor nuclei of the trigeminal and facial nucleus was caused by the uptake of horseradish peroxidase by axons in the musculature surrounding the injection site which were probably damaged by the dissection procedure. The <b>salivatory</b> neurons were fusiform multipolar cells which were mainly located in the ipsilateral nucleus reticularis parvocellularis. No evidence for <b>salivatory</b> neurons in the nucleus supragenualis was found...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrophysiological}} {{properties of}} parasympathetic preganglionic neurones in the superior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus were studied in thin- and thick-slice preparations of rats aged 1 and 2 weeks using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The superior <b>salivatory</b> neurones {{were identified by}} a retrograde tracing method with dextran-tetramethylrhodamine-lysine. The injection of the tracer into the chorda-lingual nerve labelled the neurones innervating the submandibular ganglia and those innervating the intra-lingual ganglia, while the injection into {{the tip of the}} tongue labelled the latter group of neurones. Firing characteristics were investigated mainly in the neurones of 6 – 8 days postnatal rats. In response to an injection of long depolarizing current pulses at hyperpolarized membrane potentials (< − 80 mV) under a current clamp, the neurones labelled from the nerve displayed a train of action potentials with either a long silent period preceding the first spike (late spiking pattern) or a long silent period interposed {{between the first and second}} spikes (interrupted spiking pattern). The neurones labelled from the tongue invariably displayed the interrupted spiking pattern. Under a voltage clamp, among the neurones from 6 – 8 days postnatal rats, those labelled from the nerve expressed either a fast or a slow transient outward current (A-current), while those labelled from the tongue invariably showed a slow transient outward current. Both the fast and slow A-currents were largely depressed by 1 mm 4 -aminopyridine. Similar fast and slow A-currents were observed in the neurones of rats aged 14 – 15 days. Both the time to peak and decay time constant of these A-currents were accelerated, suggesting a developmental trend of maturation in the activation and inactivation kinetics between 6 and 15 days postnatal. Based on the differences in the firing pattern and outward current, the superior <b>salivatory</b> neurones can be separated into two distinct types. We discuss the functional aspects of these two types of neurones with reference to their target organs...|$|E
40|$|Unilateral {{electrical}} {{stimulation of the}} <b>salivatory</b> nucleus evoked a secretion from the ipsilateral parotid gland which was well maintained. Flow rate was not affected by sympathetic decentralization or by adrenoceptor antagonists but was abolished by atropine. Protein secretion was reduced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists but not by sympathetic decentralization or adrenalectomy. In support of previous histochemical findings it is concluded that {{the cells of the}} reticular formation are the origin of the preganglionic parasympathetic fibres to the salivary glands but that a beta-adrenoceptor mechanism as yet unidentified is also involved in the protein secretion...|$|E
40|$|To learn whether {{horseradish}} peroxidase (HRP) injections in gustatory papillae {{on the tongue}} {{can be used to}} study central topographical projections of taste buds and papillae, injections were made into the circumvallate papilla in rats. Labeled central projections after papilla injections were compared to projections after applying HRP to the cut glossopharyngeal nerve. Papilla injections result in HRP transport by afferent and efferent fibers of the glossopharyngeal nerve, and the pattern of central projections is similar to that after labeling the cut nerve. Projections include a separation in the brainstem of afferent, dorsally located fibers and efferent, ventrally located fibers. Afferent fibers project to the solitary nucleus and the trigeminal system. Efferent projections label muscle motorneurons in the nucleus ambiguus and the cells of origin of parasympathetic preganglionic fibers, which form the inferior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus. The parasympathetic neurons labeled after papilla projections are preganglionic fibers to Remak's ganglia in the tongue; postganglionic fibers of these ganglia are the secretomotor supply to the von Ebner's glands. In summary, injections of HRP into gustatory papillae reliably label central projections of the papilla and can be used for studies to discern topography in central projections of the taste system. Injections into the circumvallate papilla also have demonstrated that the parasympathetic neurons innervating von Ebner's glands are located in the inferior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus...|$|E
40|$|Cluster {{headache}} (CH) {{is characterized}} by episodes of severe unilateral headache accompanied by symptoms of cranial parasympathetic hyperactivity and sympathetic dysfunction that occur in cluster periods. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies have demonstrated evidence of a central generator of CH attacks located in the posterior-inferior hypothalamus. It {{has been suggested that}} the autonomic symptoms in CH result from reflex activation of the superior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus secondary to activation of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). However, several cases of CH-like symptoms with no head pain have been documented. We describe a patient who had suffered from typical episodic CH for two decades; it later converted into episodic autonomic dysfunction without head pain...|$|E

Am J Physiol Regulatory Inte-grative Comp Physiol 279 : R 202 –R 209, 2000. —Regional in-fluences of parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation on choroidal blood flow were investigated in anesthetized rats. Parasympathetic pterygopalatine neurons were activated by electrically stimulating the superior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus, whereas sympathetic neurons were activated by cervical sympathetic trunk stimulation and uveal blood flow {{was measured by}} laser Doppler flowmetry.

40|$|The {{effect of}} sympathectomy on {{parasympathetic}} regulation of ocular perfusion was investigated. Uveal blood {{flow through the}} vortex veins was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry during electrical stimulation of the superior <b>salivatory</b> nucleus, which activates ocular parasympathetic nerves, in adult rats with in-tact innervation and 2 days or 6 weeks after excision of the ipsilateral superior cervical ganglion. In all groups, parasympa-thetic stimulation produced comparable increases in flux, which were abolished by the selective neuronal nitric-oxide synthetase inhibitor, 1 -(2 -trifluoromethylphenyl) imidazole. At-ropine had no effect in control and acutely sympathectomized rats but abolished the flux increase in four of six chronically sympathectomized animals, and 1 -(2 -trifluoromethylphenyl) imidazole eliminated the residual response.
