40|$|During {{heat-setting}} {{of textiles}} in stenting frames the emission of vaporable substances from fibre accompanying agents {{and parts of}} the liquor composition can occur. Organic emissions have been detected by a flame-ionisation-detector (FID) and by the adsorption of the substances on silicagel (Coulometrie). An indication to the composition of the emissions can be derived from non-constant proportionalities of the results from FID and Coulometrie. During the project not only the emissions of stenter-frame processes were detected, but also from drying-, thermosol- and <b>singeing</b> <b>machine</b> processes. Vaporable substances on textiles can in principle be detected by head-space-gaschromatographie or thermogravimetry. But it is impossible to give a forecast on the effective emissions from this knowledge. Therefore the development of an apparatus is described which allows the determination of the emissions in dependence on process parameters in laboratory and also, the development of finishing recipes for minimized emissionsAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 94 B 74 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|E
40|$|Control of {{the warp}} and weft yarn tension is an {{important}} factor. In this research, effect of warp yarn tension variations {{on the quality of}} greige and dyed woven fabrics was investigated. Six fabric samples (three Plain and three Twill weaves) were woven on shuttle loom at varied warp yarn tension. The fabric samples were then pre-treated and dyed (Drimarene Red Cl 5 B, 3 % owf) using laboratory <b>singeing</b> <b>machine</b> and HT dyeing machine. Greige fabric quality such as fabric inspection, fabric length, fabric width, GSM (Gram per Square Meter), EPI (Ends per Inch), PPI (Picks per Inch), and dyed fabric quality such as L*, a*, b*, C, h o, (K/S) ?max and fastness properties were assessed according to the standard. It has been observed that fabric samples, both Plain and Twill weave; woven at improper warp yarns tension gives rejected greige fabric quality and 1 - 7 % lower (K/S) 550 nm values as compared to the fabric weave at requisite warp yarn tension such as 38 - 39 cN for Plain fabric and 78 cN for Twill fabric for 42 x 38 and 64 x 36 tex construction. Hence, among other weave faults, warp yarn tension variation has influence on the greige fabric quality as well as caused improper and uneven dyeing behavior...|$|E
50|$|<b>Singeing</b> <b>machines</b> can be {{of three}} types: plate {{singeing}}, roller singeing, or gas singeing. Gas singeing is widely used in the textile industry. In gas singeing, a flame comes into direct contact to the fabric and burn the protruding fiber. Here, flame height and fabric speed is the main concern to minimize the fabric damage.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} scheduling multi-operation jobs on a <b>singe</b> <b>machine</b> to minimize the total completion time. Each job consists of several operations that belong to different families. In a schedule each family of job operations may be processed as batches with each batch incurring a set-up time. A job is completed when all of its operations have been processed. We first show {{that the problem is}} strongly NP-hard even when the set-up times are common and each operation is not missing. When the operations have identical processing times and either the maximum set-up time is sufficiently small or the minimum set-up time is sufficiently large, the problem can be solved in polynomial time. We then {{consider the}} problem under the job-batch restriction in which the operations of each batch is partitioned into operation batches according to a partition of the jobs. We show that this case of the problem can be solved in polynomial time under a certain condition. ...|$|R
