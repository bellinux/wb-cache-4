25|$|Rather than {{go through}} the process of {{submitting}} an unorthodox design for official consideration, Miles decided to build and fly a mock-up. Miles tasked Ray Bournon with designing a small single-engined single-seat aircraft, the Miles M.35. Design and construction was completed in six weeks. The result was a small wooden aircraft with a high-set front wing and low-set rear wing, fixed tricycle undercarriage, and pusher propeller, with the engine {{in the rear of the}} fuselage and the pilot <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the fuselage.|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} of Moro's capture the terrorists fired 93 bullets. These killed all the {{five members of the}} escort but left Moro with only a light wound in his thigh. Despite this {{apparent}} precision, members of the BR such as Valerio Morucci declared that they had only a rough shooting training, obtained by firing their weapons in grottoes at night. The position of the bodyguards (two <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> seats of Moro's car, and three in the following one), separated from the politician, likely made it easier for the ambush squad to direct their fire against them and avoid hitting Moro.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} {{is divided into}} three principal spaces. Musicians occupy the lower left section, one of whom is centrally located, his back turned toward the viewer, with his double-bass erected to the left. A row of dancers, two women and two men with their legs raised, occupy the upper right. They are characterized by curves and rhythmic repetition, creating a synthetic sense of dynamical movement. The background consists of ornate cabaret-style lighting fixtures, and a few members of the audience <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> row, their eyes fixed on the performance. On the lower right another client is staring with a sidelong glance, indicative of sexual desire or sly and malicious intent; the archetype of a male voyeur, often portrayed in mid-century journalistic illustrations of the can-can.|$|E
25|$|During Court sessions, {{the justices}} sit {{according}} to seniority, with the Chief Justice in the center, and the Associate Justices on alternating sides, {{with the most}} senior Associate Justice on the Chief Justice's immediate right, and the most junior Associate Justice seated on the left farthest away from the Chief Justice. Therefore, the current court sits as follows from left to right, {{from the perspective of}} those facing the Court: Kagan, Alito, Ginsburg, Kennedy (most senior Associate Justice), Roberts (Chief Justice), Thomas, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Gorsuch. In the official yearly Court photograph, justices are arranged similarly, with the five most senior members <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> row in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions (The most recent photograph includes Ginsburg, Kennedy, Roberts, Thomas, Breyer), and the four most junior justices standing behind them, again in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions (Kagan, Alito, Sotomayor, Gorsuch).|$|E

25|$|Instant Replay {{made its}} debut in Major League Baseball at Tropicana Field on September 3 after Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees hit a ball near the left-field foul pole that was {{initially}} ruled a home run by third base umpire Brian Runge. Rays manager Joe Maddon argued that the ball was foul {{and asked for a}} review. After a conversation among the umpires, though all agreed the play was ruled correctly, crew chief Charlie Reliford allowed the replay to take place and after review, upheld the home run call. On September 19 at Tropicana Field, instant replay would overturn a call on the field {{for the first time ever}} in Major League Baseball. A fly ball hit by Rays' first baseman Carlos Peña, the umpires ruled, was interfered with by a fan <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> row of the stands, when the ball hit the hands of the fan and fell back onto the field of play. After Joe Maddon requested the umpires hold a conference to discuss the play, the umpires, headed by Gerry Davis, decided to look at instant replay. Just over four minutes later, Davis returned to the field and signaled that the ball was a home run.|$|E

Marchant had risen to prominence by winning the 500m time trial at the 1955 Australian Championships for juniors, prompting Browne to select him as his partner based on his raw speed. For a final test run before formally committing to racing together, the pair simply had a few tandem sprints around the track, with Browne <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> seat. They were a contrasting pair; Marchant was a short man of [...] and , while Browne stood at [...] and , unusually tall for a cyclist.

500|$|The first table read of {{the episode}} was held on January 9, 1991. The episode was filmed {{in front of a}} live {{audience}} on January 15, 1991. Filming {{of the episode}} took place at the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, where, starting with the season premiere [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", filming of all the show's episodes took place. A few scenes were changed prior to the filming of the episode. The scene in which Jerry informs George he told Elaine about the apartment initially showed them standing in line for the movies, talking about <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the theatre. George would tell Jerry that he once pretended to have a grotesque physical impairment while he was standing in line to get a ticket for The Exorcist (1973), and people would let him go in front of them without saying anything. The location of this scene, however, was changed to Monk's Cafe, a regular hangout for the show's main characters, and George and Jerry's dialogue was shortened. In the original script, Jerry, instead of George, proclaimed himself [...] "lord of the idiots", but this was changed during rehearsals.|$|E

[...] Referring to popular culture, he wrote of being raised [...] "on a hearty diet of crap". His parents divorced when Chabon was 11, and he grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Columbia, Maryland. Columbia, where Chabon lived nine months of the year with his mother, was [...] "a progressive planned living community in which racial, economic, and religious diversity were actively fostered."

Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song's first verse. When it comes to the chorus, a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits in the backseat on the passenger side. When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also in the backseat, but on the driver's side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, and when it comes to the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> passenger seat. During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera comes back to the driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, tosses it into the back seat, and becomes as loud as the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the outro, she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be [...] "ironic" [...] in itself since the video started with her at a gas station).
