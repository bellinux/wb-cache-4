5|$|As designed, {{the ships}} did not handle {{particularly}} well, even in calm seas, and their motion was quite stiff. The ships experienced severe rolling, {{due to the}} weight of the wing turrets. The heavy wing turrets caused the ships to have a large metacentric height, which should have made them very stable gun platforms, but their roll period proved to coincide with that of the average North Sea swell. Bilge keels were later added, which helped to improve the rolling problem. Despite the tendency to roll, the Nassau-class ships were maneuverable and had a small turning radius. They suffered minor <b>speed</b> <b>loss</b> in heavy seas, but up to 70percent at hard rudder. The roll keels that had been fitted to improve handling caused a portion of the <b>speed</b> <b>loss</b> at hard rudder.|$|E

Bilge keels were later added to improve stability, and the space previously used for the anti-roll tanks was instead used as extra fuel storage. The ship was able to carry an additional 180 t(200 short tons) of coal in the anti-roll tanks. Von der Tanns hull consisted of 15 watertight compartments, and a double bottom extended for 75% of the ship's length. The ship was known to have good maneuvering characteristics, with a <b>speed</b> <b>loss</b> of 60% and a heel of 8degrees at full rudder.|$|E

6000|$|For {{some years}} more, Mr. Stephenson (he is now fairly {{entitled}} to that respectable prefix) went on still further experimenting {{on the question}} of locomotives and railways. He was now beginning to learn that much unnecessary wear and tear arose on the short lines of rail down from the pit's mouths to the loading-places on the river by the inequalities and roughnesses of the joints; and he invented a method of overlapping the rails which quite got over this source of loss--loss of <b>speed,</b> <b>loss</b> of power, and loss of material at once. It was in 1819 that he laid down his first considerable piece of road, the Hetton railway. The owners of a colliery at the village of Hetton, in Durham, determined to replace their waggon road by a locomotive line; and they invited the now locally famous Killingworth engine-wright to act as their engineer. Stephenson gladly undertook the post; and he laid down a railway of eight miles in length, on the larger part of which the trucks were to be drawn by [...] "the iron horse," [...] as people now began to style the altered and improved locomotive. The Hetton railway was opened in 1822, and the assembled crowd were delighted at beholding a single engine draw seventeen loaded trucks after it, at the extraordinary rate of four miles an hour--nearly as fast as a man could walk. Whence it may be gathered that Stephenson's ideas up{{on the question of}} speed were still on a very humble scale indeed.|$|E

40|$|The {{cryogenic}} {{performance of}} two commercially available SiC power MOSFETs {{are presented in}} this work. The devices are characterised in static and dynamic tests at 10 K intervals from 20 - 320 K. Static current-voltage characterisation indicates that at low temperatures threshold voltage, turn-on voltage, on-state resistance, transconductance, and the body diode turn-on voltage all increase while saturation current decreases. Dynamic, 60 V, 3 A switching tests within the cryogenic chamber are also reported and the trends of switching <b>speed,</b> <b>losses,</b> and total power losses, which rise at low temperature, are presented.
