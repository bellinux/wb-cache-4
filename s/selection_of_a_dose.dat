40|$|Background The phase I {{program of}} anticancer agents usually {{consists}} of multiple dose escalation studies to select <b>a</b> safe <b>dose</b> for various administration schedules. We hypothesized that pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK–PD) modeling <b>of</b> <b>an</b> initial phase I study (stage 1) {{can be used}} for <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> optimal starting <b>dose</b> for subsequent studies (stage 2) and that a post-hoc PK–PD analysis enhances the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> recommended <b>dose</b> for phase II evaluation. The aim of this analysis was to demonstrate that this two-stage model-based design, which does not interfere in the conduct of trials, is safe, efficient and effective. Methods PK and PD data of dose escalation studies were simulated for nine compounds and for five administration regimens (stage 1) for drugs with neutropenia as dose-limiting toxicity. PK–PD models were developed for each simulated study and were used to determine <b>a</b> starting <b>dose</b> for additional phase I studies (stage 2). The model-based design was compared to a conventional study design regarding safety (number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)), efficiency (number of patients treated with <b>a</b> <b>dose</b> below the recommended dose) and effectiveness (precision <b>of</b> dose <b>selection).</b> Retrospective data <b>of</b> the investigational anticancer drug indisulam were used to show the applicability of the model-based design.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In current practice, {{patients}} {{scheduled for}} radiotherapy are treated according to 'rigid' protocols with predefined dose prescriptions {{that do not}} consider risk-taking preferences of individuals. The therapeutic operating characteristic (TOC) graph is applied as a decision-aid to assess the trade-off between treatment benefit and morbidity to facilitate dose prescription customisation. METHODS: Historical dose-response data from prostate cancer patient cohorts treated with 3 D-conformal radiotherapy is used to construct TOC graphs. Next, intensity-modulated (IMRT) plans are generated by optimisation based on dosimetric criteria and dose-response relationships. TOC graphs are constructed for dose-scaling of the optimised IMRT plan and individualised dose prescription. The area under the TOC curve (AUC) is estimated to measure the therapeutic power of these plans. RESULTS: On a continuous scale, the TOC graph directly visualises treatment benefit and morbidity risk of physicians' or patients' choices for dose (de-) escalation. The trade-off between these probabilities facilitates the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> individualised <b>dose</b> prescription. TOC graphs show broader therapeutic window and higher AUCs with increasing target dose heterogeneity.

For the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> optimal <b>dosing</b> regimen it is necessary to determine which pharmacodynamic parameter best predicts efficacy during combi-nation therapy and to find a simple method for susceptibility testing. An easy-to-use, previously described E-test method was evaluated as a test for susceptibility to combination therapy. That test resulted in a MICcombi, which is the MIC of, for example, tobramycin in the presence of ceftazidime. By dividing the tobramycin and ceftazidime concentration by the MICcombi at each time point during the dosing interval, fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) curves were constructed, and from these curves new pharmacodynamic parameters for combination therapy were calculated (i. e., AUCcombi, Cmax-combi, T>MIC-combi, and T>FICi, where AUCcombi, Cmax-combi, T>MIC-combi, and T>FICi are the area under the FICcombi curve, the peak concentration of FICcombi, the time that the concentration of the combination is above the MICcombi, and the time above the FIC index, respectively).

Qualitatively, pharmacokinetic informa-tion can help identify the chemical species that may be causally associated with observed toxic responses. This is particularly important for TCE because many of its toxic effects {{are thought to be}} due to metabolites rather than to TCE alone (Caldwell and Keshava 2006). In addition the delineation of inter- and intraspecies pharmacokinetic differences can provide insight into how laboratory animal and epidemiological data may inform overall human health risks and how individual suscep-tibility may differ. Furthermore, physiologi-cally based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models can quantify the relationship between external measures of exposure and internal measures of toxicologically relevant <b>dose.</b> <b>Selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> appropriate <b>dose</b> metric for use in risk assess-ment depends on both <b>an</b> understanding <b>of</b> the target tissue, active chemical agent, and mode of action (MOA) for a particular toxic effect [see Caldwell and Keshava (2006) and Keshava and Caldwell (2006) for additional MOA discussion] and the reliability of the PBPK models themselves.

40|$|Background: Although cis-diamminedichloro-platinum (CDDP) {{exhibits}} strong therapeutic {{effects in}} cancer chemotherapy, its adverse effects such as peripheral neuropathy, nephropathy, and vomiting are dose-limiting factors. Previous studies reported that chronotherapy decreased CDDP-induced nephropathy and vomiting. In the present study, we investigated {{the influence of}} dosing times on CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy in rats. Methods: CDDP (4 mg/kg) was administered intravenously at 5 : 00 or 17 : 00 every 7 days for 4 weeks to male Sprague-Dawley rats, and saline {{was given to the}} control group. To assess the dosing time dependency of peripheral neuropathy, von-Frey test and hot-plate test were performed. Results: In order to estimate hypoalgesia, the hot-plate test was performed in rats administered CDDP weekly for 4 weeks. On day 28, the withdrawal latency to thermal stimulation was significantly prolonged in the 17 : 00 -treated group than in the control and 5 : 00 -treated groups. When the von-Frey test was performed to assess mechanical allodynia, the withdrawal threshold was significantly lower in the 5 : 00 and 17 : 00 -treated groups than in the control group on day 6 after the first CDDP dose. The 5 : 00 -treated group maintained allodynia throughout the experiment with the repeated administration of CDDP, whereas the 17 : 00 -treated group deteriorated from allodynia to hypoalgesia. Conclusions: It was revealed that the severe of CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy was inhibited in the 5 : 00 -treated group, whereas CDDP-treated groups exhibited mechanical allodynia.

In that work, we demonstrated that 64 Cu remains stably associated with the liposome following injection into mice or incubation in human plasma. The ability to directly and stably radiolabel nanotherapeutics such as MM- 302 offers the possibility of adapting these molecules for combined therapy and diagnostic imaging and provides a valuable translational tool to obtain quantitative biodistribution and deposition data for therapeutic agents.

40|$|International audienceRATIONALE: Blockade of 5 -HT 6 receptors (5 -HT 6 R) {{is known}} to improve {{cognitive}} performances in the rodent. This improvement has been hypothesized to be the result, at least in part, <b>of</b> <b>a</b> modulation <b>of</b> the cholinergic neurotransmission. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effects of 5 -HT 6 R blockade on selected types of memory relevant to functional deficits of ageing and neurodegenerative diseases, in mice that present a scopolamine-induced cholinergic disruption of memory. METHOD: Following the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adequate <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> scopolamine to induce cognitive deficits, we have studied {{the effects of the}} selective 5 -HT 6 R antagonist SB- 271046, alone or in combination with scopolamine, on working memory (spontaneous alternation task in the T-maze), recognition memory (place recognition) and aversive learning (passive avoidance). RESULTS: SB- 271046 alone failed to affect working memory, recognition memory and aversive learning performances. In contrast, SB- 271046 was able to reverse the scopolamine-induced deficits in working memory (only at 30 mg kg⁻¹) and those of acquisition and retrieval of aversive learning (dose-dependent effect); scopolamine-induced deficits in episodic-like memory (acquisition and retrieval) were partially counteracted by 5 -HT 6 R blockade. CONCLUSION: The modulation between 5 -HT 6 R and the cholinergic system appears to be predominant for working memory and aversive learning, but not for other types of memory (i. e. episodic-like memory). Interactions between 5 -HT 6 R and alternative neurotransmission systems (i. e. glutamatergic system) should be further studied. The respective involvement of these interactions in the memory disorders related to ageing and neurodegenerative diseases is of pivotal importance regarding the possible use of 5 -HT 6 R antagonists in the treatment of memory disorders in humans...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Thirty-five rats were divided into three groups: Group I served as control, Group II received tobramycin at 4 mg/Kg of body weight intraperitoneally every 8 hours for ten days, and Group III received once-daily dosing of intraperitoneal injection of tobramycin at 12 mg/Kg of body weight for ten days. The rats were sacrificed 3 days after the last injection. Small pieces of the right kidneys of all the animals were processed for light and electron microscopic examination. Results: The study showed that tobramycin resulted in certain structural and ultrastructural changes in the proximal convoluted tubules. These changes included vacuolar degeneration in the epithelial cells, increased number of lysosomes with variably sized myeloid bodies, mitochondrial oedema, and loss of apical microvilli. These changes were clearly evident following multiple-daily dosing and were less obvious following once-daily dosing. Furthermore, regenerating tubular epithelial cells were evident following once-daily dosing administration.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: To {{understand}} which factors {{could affect}} the assessment of anti-vascular treatment by DCE-MRI, we investigated possible causes that could have hampered the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> optimal biological <b>dose</b> in humans of the vascular targeted agent NGR-hTNF by DCE-MRI: (1) insufficient reproducibility of DCE-MRI; (2) less specific targeting of NGR-hTNF; (3) interference of vessel characteristics with NGR-hTNF efficacy; (4) interfering pharmacodynamic effects. EXPERIMENTAL: In a phase I study NGR-hTNF, DCE-MRI was performed at baseline and 2 h after NGR-hTNF administration in 31 patients with advanced solid cancer. Reproducibility measurements were performed in 5 other non-treated patients with metastatic disease. Mean k(ep), K(trans) values and their histogram distribution were determined in metastases and healthy liver tissue. The correlation between tumour size and DCE-MRI parameters was determined. Kinetics of soluble TNF receptors {{and the development of}} anti-TNF antibodies were assessed. RESULTS: Reproducibility of the DCE-MRI technique was adequate. Mean DCE-MRI parameters did not significantly change after NGR-hTNF administration, but histogram analyses showed significant changes in metastases and healthy liver tissue in some patients. The anti-vascular effects of NGR-hTNF were larger in smaller tumours, which have less mature neovasculature. Soluble TNF receptors were released. CONCLUSIONS: The difficulty to find <b>an</b> optimal biological <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> NGR-TNF by DCE-MRI is likely caused by <b>a</b> combination <b>of</b> factors: (i) different profiles of early anti-vascular effects in tumours and healthy liver tissue, (ii) dependence of the magnitude of the anti-vascular effect of NGR-hTNF on tumour size and (iii) shedding kinetics of soluble TNFalpha receptors...|$|R

In addition, measurement of PK/PD biomarkers can minimize uncertainty associated with predicting drug safety and efficacy, reduce the high levels of drug attrition during development, accelerate drug approval, and decrease the overall costs of drug development. However, there are many challenges in {{the development and implementation of}} biomarkers that probably explain their disappointingly low implementation in phase I trials. The Pharmacodynamic/Pharmacokinetic Technologies Advisory committee of Cancer Research UK has found that submissions for phase I trials of new cancer drugs in the United Kingdom often lack detailed information about PK and/or PD endpoints, which leads to suboptimal information being obtained in those trials or to delays in starting the trials while PK/PD methods are developed and validated. Minimally invasive PK/PD technologies have logistic and ethical advantages over more invasive technologies. Here we review these technologies, emphasizing magnetic resonance spectroscopy and positron emission tomography, which provide detailed functional and metabolic information.

This reaction {{resulted in the}} mixed AT/C 12 N 3 films, with the portion of C 12 N 3 precisely controlled by <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suitable UV <b>dose.</b> <b>As</b> the primary matrix, either nonsubstituted or oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) -substituted AT SAMs were used, targeting mixed SAMs of chemical and biological significance. To demonstrate {{the flexibility of the}} approach, UV light with two different wavelengths (254 and 375 nm) was used, applied to the nonsubstituted and OEG-substituted AT SAMs, respectively. The surface density of the chemically active azide groups embedded in the nonreactive primary matrix could be varied according to the composition of the mixed SAMs, as demonstrated by the subsequent click reaction between these SAMs and several representative functional moieties bearing a suitable group for the click reaction with azide. For the OEG-AT/C 12 N 3 films, this resulted in the preparation of templates for specific protein adsorption, comprising biotin-bearing moieties embedded in the protein-repelling OEG-AT matrix. The density of the biotin receptors was varied according to the density of the C 12 N 3 moieties. The templates exhibited much higher affinity to the specific protein (avidin) as compared to a nonspecific one. The surface density of avidin could be varied in accordance with the density of the biotin receptors, i. e., directly controlled by the UV dose within the UVPER procedure. The entire approach was extended to lithography, relying on a commercial maskless UV lithography setup.

In modern {{international}} guidelines, {{there are}} not distinguished criteria {{for the evaluation of}} clinical symptoms, including somatic, neurological status, although almost all neuroendocrinologists acknowledge the presence exactly of heterospecific complaints and symptoms in patients with organic hyperprolactinemia. Treatment of organic hyperprolactinemia is aimed at achieving recovery of normal levels of the biologically active prolactin (PRL) and a reduction in adenoma volume. The objective of the study — to investigate the clinical and hormonal effectiveness of different modes of suppressive cabergoline therapy in patients with prolactinoma during 12 months. Materials and methods of the study. 61 patients with prolactinoma (PROL) (52 women and 9 men) aged 16 – 66 years were examined and underwent 12 -month course of treatment by selective dopamine agonist cabergoline (CAB). The total duration of the disease ranged from 1 to 60 months, average one — 12. 3 ± 10. 1 months. 40 women treated with CAB had microPROL, 12 — macro- and giant PROL. 2 men had microadenoma, 7 — macroadenoma. PROL was verified using magnetic resonance imaging. PRL blood levels (ng/mL) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on automated analyzer StatFax 2100 (Awareness Technology, USA) by means of commercial ELISA reagent kit (DRG Diagnostics, USA). We have used two modes of therapy: first one — the mode of gradual increase of CAB dose, starting from 0. 5 mg a week, with subsequent control of the PRL blood level every 4 weeks and titration of the dose if necessary (increase in <b>a</b> week <b>dose</b> by 0. 25 – 0. 5 mg). Second one — the mode of high starting doses {{on the basis of the}} following: the quantity of CAB tablets (0. 5 mg) corresponded to the rate of increased PRL blood levels in relation to the upper limit of age norm, but no more than 4 mg (8 tablets) a week. The statistical data analysis was carried out using program package Statgraphics Plus for Windows 3. 0 (Manugistic Inc. USA). Results. We have proposed an integrated scoring system to assess the clinical and hormonal effectiveness of CAB suppressive therapy in patients with organic hyperprolactinemia, which enables at all stages of follow-up to correct treatment, to assess the possible risks from the use of high doses of the drug and to optimize the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adequate <b>dose.</b> The optimal mode of therapy with cabergoline in patients with microprolactinoma is the regimen of gradually increasing doses, the positive clinical and hormonal effect of which is observed in 80 % of patients 3 months after initiation of treatment. Conclusions. Administration of high starting doses of cabergoline in patients with macro- and giant prolactinomas enables in <b>a</b> short span <b>of</b> time (in 1 month) to achieve reliable positive dynamics of the indicators of neurological, performance and hormonal status compared with the group of patients receiving therapy in the mode of gradually increasing doses of the drug...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Glycoprotein- 96, a non-polymorphic heat-shock protein, {{associates}} with intracellular peptides. Autologous tumor-derived heat shock protein-peptide complex 96 (HSPPC- 96) can elicit potent tumor-specific T cell responses and protective immunity in animal models. We {{sought to investigate}} the feasibility, safety, and antitumor activity of HSPPC- 96 vaccines prepared from tumor specimens of patients with metastatic melanoma. Methods Patients with a Karnofsky Performance Status > 70 % and stage III or stage IV melanoma {{had to have a}} metastasis > 3 cm in diameter resectable as part of routine clinical management. HSPPC- 96 tumor-derived vaccines were prepared in one of three dose levels (2. 5, 25, or 100 μg/dose) and administered as an intradermal injection weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. In vivo induction of immunity was evaluated using delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to HSPPC- 96, irradiated tumor, and dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). The γ-interferon (IFNγ) ELISPOT assay was used to measure induction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> peripheral blood mononuclear cell response against autologous tumor cells at baseline and at the beginning of weeks 3, 4, and 8. Results Among 36 patients enrolled, 72 % had stage IV melanoma and 83 % had received prior systemic therapy. The smallest tumor specimen from which HSPPC- 96 was prepared weighed 2 g. Twelve patients (including 9 with stage IV and indicator lesions) had a negative DNCB skin test result at baseline. All 36 patients were treated and evaluable for toxicity and response. There were no serious toxicities. There were no observed DTH responses to HSPPC- 96 or to autologous tumor cells before or during treatment. The IFNγ-producing cell count rose modestly in 5 of 26 patients and returned to baseline by week 8, with no discernible association with HSPPC- 96 dosing or clinical parameters. There were no objective responses among 16 patients with stage IV disease and indicator lesions. Among 20 patients treated in the adjuvant setting, 11 with stage IV melanoma at baseline had a progression-free and overall survival of 45 % and 82 %, respectively, with <b>a</b> median follow-up <b>of</b> 10 years. Conclusion Treatment with autologous tumor-derived HSPPC- 96 was feasible and safe at all doses tested. Observed immunological effects and antitumor activity were modest, precluding <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> biologically active <b>dose.</b> Nevertheless, the 25 -μg dose level was shown to be practical for further study. </p...|$|R

40|$|Kidney {{impairment}} has global {{consequences in}} the organism homeostasis and a disorder like Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) might eventually exacerbates into End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) where a complete renal replacement therapy like dialysis is necessary. Dialysis partially reintegrates the blood ltration process; however, {{even when it}} is associated to a pharmacological therapy, this is not su fficient to completely replace the renal endocrine role and causes the development of common complications, like CKD secondary anemia (CKD-anemia) The availability of exogenous Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA, synthetic molecules with similar structure and same mechanism of action as human erythropoietin) improved the treatment of CKD-anemia although the clinical outcomes are still not completely successful. In particular, for ERSD dialysis patients main di culties in the <b>selection</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> optimal therapy <b>dosing</b> derive from the high intra- and inter-individual response variability and the temporal discrepancy between the short ESA permanence in the blood (hours) and the long Red Blood Cells lifespan (months). The aim of this thesis has been to describe the development of the Anemia Control Model (ACM), a tool designed to support physicians in managing anemia for ESRD patines undergoing dialysis. Five main pillars constitute the foundation of this work: - Understanding the medical problem; - Availability of the data needed to derive the models; - Mathematical and Machine Learning modeling; - Development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> product usable at the point of care; - Medical device certi cation and clinical evaluation of the developed product. The understanding of the medical problem is fundamental for two reasons: firstly because the medical problem must be the driver of the product scope and consequently of its design; secondly because <b>a</b> good understanding <b>of</b> the medical problem is of fundamental importance to develop optimized models. In the case of anemia management the drug <b>dosing</b> is <b>an</b> important task where predictive models could support physicians to improve the treatment quality. In particular, considering that hemoglobin is the typical parameter used to measure anemia, our model were tailored to predict hemoglobin response to the two main drugs normally used to correct anemia, that is ESA and Iron. In a mathematical model based on di erential equations, like the one presented in this thesis, the knowledge of the main physiological processes related to anemia is the base to properly design the equations. A machine learning approach in principle can be built with no hypotesis, because it relays in learning from data, nevertheless knowledge of the domain helps to make better use of the available data. The medical problem has been discussed in Chapter 1. The availability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> huge database <b>of</b> very well structured data was basic for the development of models. Quality of the data is another important aspect. Chapter 2 gives the reader <b>an</b> overview <b>of</b> the available data [...] The core of the ACM is the capability to predict for each patient the future hemoglobin concentrations as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> past patient's clinical history and future drug prescription. By means of well performing and personalized predictive model it is possible to simulate how, for each specific c patient, di erent <b>doses</b> would <b>a</b> ffect hemoglobin trends. Mathematical and machine learning models present both advantages and limitations. Chapter 3 describes the mathematical model and analyzes its performances, while Chapter 4 is dedicated to the machine learning models. In our case the machine learning approach resulted more suitable for our scope, because its was well performing on the entire population, more stable and, once trained, very quick in elaborating the prediction. Once the predictive model was obtained, {{the next step was to}} wrap it into a service that could be consumed by a third party system (for example an app or a clinical system) where physicians could benefi t from the model prediction capability. To achieve that, firstly an algorithm for the dose selection was developed; secondly, a data structure for the communication with the third party system was defi ned; fi nally, the whole package was wrapped in a web service. These arguments have been discussed in the rst part of Chapter 5. Mistakes in ESA or Iron dosing might have serious consequences on patients' health, for this reason ACM intended use was limited to provide dose suggestions only; physicians must evaluate them and decide whether to accept or reject them. Nevertheless, such a tool could be considered as Medical Device under European Medical Device Directive (MDD); for this reason, to be on the safe side, it was decided to certify the ACM as medical device. A novel approach was developed to perform the risk assessment, the main idea being that ACM might generate risks when <b>a</b> <b>dose</b> suggestion is produced based on a wrong prediction. To assess this risk the model error distribution over the test set was utilized as estimation of the error distribution of the live system. Finally, <b>a</b> clinical evaluation <b>of</b> the ACM in three pilot clinics has been performed before deciding to roll-out the tool in more clinics. These arguments have been discussed in the second part of Chapter 5...|$|R
