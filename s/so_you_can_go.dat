6000|$|Miggleton's restaurant, on Forty-second Street, was {{a romantic}} discovery. Though it had [...] "popular prices"--plain omelet, fifteen cents--it had {{red and green}} bracket lights, mission-style tables, and music played by a sparrowlike pianist and a violinist. Mr. Wrenn never really heard the music, but while it was quavering he had a happier {{appreciation}} of the Silk-Hat-Harry humorous pictures in the Journal, which he always propped up against an oil-cruet. [That never caused him inconvenience; he had no convictions in regard to salads.] He would drop the paper to look {{out of the window}} at the Lazydays Improvement Company's electric sign, showing gardens of paradise on the instalment plan, and dream of--well, he hadn't the slightest idea what--something distant and deliciously likely to become intimate. Once or twice {{he knew that he was}} visioning the girl in soft brown whom he would [...] "go home to," [...] and who, in a Lazydays suburban residence, would play just such music for him and the friends who lived near by. She would be as clever as Istra, but [...] "oh, more <b>so's</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> regular places with her."...

Drummer Will Champion spoke to Jo Whiley of BBC Radio 2 fame, saying {{in response to a question}} about the album being more stripped-back: [...] "Yeah, that might be nice, actually.

Lyman stated that he allowed Mcelfresh to perform the show because he has not been charged with a misdemeanor, stating that [...] "If he was a legitimate danger to anyone, he simply wouldn't be here." [...] Many bands tweeted their opinions of the situation, practically all in distaste. Mcelfresh also dealt with a concertgoer in the crowd who publicly criticized him, saying [...] "The difference between you and me is that I know who I am, and I am very proud of that. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> ahead, watch my set.

This leading to much criticism towards the public worker, with Mexican citizens and news media saying Nuño {{did not know how to}} read, and question his preparation for his job. Days after student Andrea said in an interview, that it was not her intention to humiliate Nuño, but that would he mispronounce [...] "ler" [...] or any word again, she would correct him again, further adding she would even correct the president.

In the early seasons of the show, Bart was the main focus. But, around the fourth season, Homer became more of the focus. According to Matt Groening, this was because [...] "With Homer, there's just a wider range of jokes <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do. And there are far more drastic consequences to Homer's stupidity.

5000|$|So {{at least}} in gasoline-burning engines, {{ignition}} timing is largely a compromise between a later [...] "retarded" [...] spark — which gives greater efficiency with high octane fuel — and an earlier [...] "advanced" [...] spark that avoids detonation with the fuel used. For this reason, high-performance diesel automobile proponents, such as Gale Banks, believe that There’s only <b>so</b> far <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> with an air-throttled engine on 91-octane gasoline. In other words, it is the fuel, gasoline, {{that has become the}} limiting factor. ... While turbocharging has been applied to both gasoline and diesel engines, only limited boost can be added to a gasoline engine before the fuel octane level again becomes a problem. With a diesel, boost pressure is essentially unlimited. It is literally possible to run as much boost as the engine will physically stand before breaking apart. Consequently, engine designers have come to realize that diesels are capable of substantially more power and torque than any comparably sized gasoline engine.|$|R
