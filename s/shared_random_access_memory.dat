40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Multiprocessor {{computers}} {{may eventually}} {{be the only}} method of increasing computer throughout. One of the major problems with multiprocessor computers is the interference or contention between processors when accessing a shared resource. This work describes the design, construction, and analysis of a prototype multiprocessor computer utilizing a replicated shared memory for interconnection which has less interference than many conventional interconnection net works. The prototype multiprocessor computer consists of five processor boards and a communications board. Each processor board contains an Intel 8086 central processing unit (CPU), resident and <b>shared</b> <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (RAM), and associated control circuitry, The shared RAM consists of five copies (replication), one for each processor, with concurrent and independent read cycles and a common write cycle. Thus, this shared memory provides minimal interference for read operations. A general probabilistic model to predict throughput with interference for a system of N processors and M shared resources is developed. Input parameters for the model include the number of processors, number of shared resources, resource utilizations, processor priority, and bandwidth of the resources. This model is applied to replicated shared memory multiprocessor computers for systems of two to five processors, two to five shared memories, and shared memory utilizations of 5...|$|E
40|$|During {{the two-year}} project period, {{we have worked}} on several aspects of Health Usage and Monitoring Systems for {{structural}} health monitoring. In particular, we have made contributions in the following areas. 1. Reference HUMS architecture: We developed a high-level architecture for health monitoring and usage systems (HUMS). The proposed reference architecture is shown. It {{is compatible with the}} Generic Open Architecture (GOA) proposed as a standard for avionics systems. 2. HUMS kernel: One of the critical layers of HUMS reference architecture is the HUMS kernel. We developed a detailed design of a kernel to implement the high level architecture. 3. Prototype implementation of HUMS kernel: We have implemented a preliminary version of the HUMS kernel on a Unix platform. We have implemented both a centralized system version and a distributed version. 4. SCRAMNet and HUMS: SCRAMNet (<b>Shared</b> Common <b>Random</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Memory</b> Network) is a system that is found to be suitable to implement HUMS. For this reason, we have conducted a simulation study to determine its stability in handling the input data rates in HUMS. 5. Architectural specification...|$|R
40|$|Multi-Axial Testing System (MATS) is a 6 -DOF {{loading system}} for {{advanced}} seismic testing of structural components or sub-assemblies in the NCREE. The MATS {{consists of two}} post-tensioned A-shape reinforced concrete frames interconnected by a steel-and-concrete composite cross beam and a reinforced concrete reacting base. The specimen can be anchored between the top cross beam and the bottom platen within a 5 -meter high and 3. 25 -meter wide clear space. This paper describes the specifications of the force, velocity and displacement capabilities of the MATS. In additional, a number of tests recently conducted using the MATS. It includes the viscous damping wall, LRB base isolator, buckling restrained brace and a 40 % reduced-scale bottom two and half stories coupled steel plate shear wall (C-SPSW) substructure. Although the pitch force control mode is not available on the MATS, the C-SPSW test results confirmed that this mode of control could be satisfactorily applied using the software developed for the <b>Shared</b> Common <b>Random</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Memory</b> Network (SCRAMNet) while the specimen was loaded using lateral displacement control mode. It is illustrated that the MATS is an effective facility for advanced hybrid seismic simulation...|$|R
40|$|The mini bus {{interface}} card (miniBIC) {{is the first}} four-channel electronic circuit board that conforms to MIL-STD- 1553 and to the electrical-footprint portion of PC/ 104. [MIL-STD- 1553 is a military standard that encompasses a method of communication and electrical- interface requirements for digital electronic subsystems connected to a data bus. PC/ 104 is an industry standard for compact, stackable modules that are fully compatible (in architecture, hardware, and software) with personal-computer data- and power-bus circuitry. ] Prior {{to the development of}} the miniBIC, only one- and two-channel PC/ 104 MIL-STD- 1553 boards were available. To obtain four channels, it was necessary to include at least two boards in a PC/ 104 stack. In comparison with such a two-board stack, the miniBIC takes up less space, consumes less power, and is more reliable. In addition, the miniBIC includes 32 digital input/output channels. The miniBIC (see figure) contains four MIL-STD- 1553 B hybrid integrated circuits (ICs), four transformers, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and an Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) interface. Each hybrid IC includes a MILSTD- 1553 dual transceiver, memory-management circuitry, processor interface logic circuitry, and 64 Kx 16 bits of <b>shared</b> static <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory.</b> The memory is used to configure message and data blocks. In addition, 23 16 -bit registers are available for (1) configuring the hybrid IC for, and starting it in, various modes of operation; (2) reading the status of the functionality of the hybrid IC; and (3) resetting the hybrid IC to a known state. The miniBIC can operate as a remote terminal, bus controller, or bus monitor. The FPGA provides the chip-select and data-strobe signals needed for operation of the hybrid ICs. The FPGA also receives interruption signals and forwards them to the ISA bus. The ISA interface connects the address, data, and control interfaces of the hybrid ICs to the ISA backplane. Each channel is, in effect, a MIL-STD- 1553 interface that can operate either independently of the others or else as a redundant version of one of the others. The transformer in each channel provides electrical isolation between the rest of the miniBIC circuitry and the bus to which that channel is connected...|$|R

To overcome the technical and physical limitation issues of conventional charge storage-based memories [11 – 18], the resistive <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> (RRAM) device which consisted of the oxide-based layer sandwiched by two electrodes was a great potential candidate for the next-generation non-volatile memory because of its superior properties such as low cost, simple structure, fast operation speed, low operation power, and non-destructive readout properties [19 – 42].|$|R
