40|$|The {{retanning}} {{process is}} the main application of formaldehyde in the tanning industry since formaldehyde participates in two groups of <b>synthetic</b> <b>organic</b> <b>tanning</b> agents: syntans and resins. Resins can be hydrolysed {{with the result that}} formaldehyde is released. Thus, formaldehyde in leather can be free or from hydrolysis of resins. Due to the carcinogenic character of formaldehyde, its presence in leather should be avoided or should be below allowable limits. The EN ISO 17226 Standard is the Official Standard for the determination of formaldehyde content in leather, which, in the authors’ opinion, presents certain ambiguities in the wording of some operations included in their analysis methods and, some of these operations, are susceptible of improvement. Therefore, a revision of the EN ISO 17226 Standard (Parts 1 and) 2 is carried out in this work and, in particular, of the extraction phase of formaldehyde present in leather (possible use of alternative surfactant and shaking method); reaction time between the extracted formaldehyde with the dinitrophenylhydrazine solution (Part 1 of the Standard) and stability of the acetylacetone solution (Part 2 of the Standard).

40|$|To {{improve the}} East Indian leather {{industry}} a search {{was made for}} tan barks and other tanning products, and their suitability and productivity per ha were assessed. At first (1917 - 1924) the study concentrated on tanning products already locally used, including those from mangrove forest, but considered also some promising local and exotic (some well known) products. For all species considered botanical data, geographic distribution and, where possible, information on bark production and quality, and on culture of the trees were discussed. Other topics were trade in leather and <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> in the Netherlands East Indies, trade in mangrove bark and catch and tanned hides in the Malayan Straits Settlements, leather dressing and working in the Netherlands East Indies, research on <b>tanning</b> <b>substances,</b> experiments on practical tanning and on methods of collecting bark. Finally followed the main conclusions for supply of <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> for the home industry. An appendix included {{a key to the}} tree species of mangrove forest...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is the at least {{partially}} substitution of chrom tanning agents by production of leather. This will be achieved by extracting of natural tanning agents from the roots of local species of the Polygonaceae plant familiy. The research project has been conducted in cooperation with NIG GmbH Magdeburg (processing of raw material) and FILK gGmbH (testing the tanning agents on leather). The FH Anhalt cultivates the species Rheum, Reynoutria and Rumex and examines and describes the <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> in these plants using chemical-analytical methods. Results: a growth period {{of at least two}} years is necessary for plants to develop enough biomass and tanning agents. In Reynoutria the <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> are located in leaves which are easier to harvest. The leaves can be harvested several times in the year over a period of up to ten years. The <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> were studied using HPLC and DC. The concentration of the <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> in raw material determined by calibration with <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> from Quebracho was insufficient. The combination of HPLC with other separation techniques such as HPTLC will be more efficient in developing analytical method for the on-line observation of the raw material. Further investigations involving larger quantities of extracts are necessary in order to consolidate the results obtained so far. These investigations should be extended to include the species Reynoutria and Polygonum. Further investigations should concentrate on the production and utilisation of the different pigments found in the roots of Rheum and Rumex for use in heavy metal-free dyeing of leather and textiles.
