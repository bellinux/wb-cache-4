Whittier in fact had not {{arrived at the}} clear splendor of his later work without some earlier turbidity; he was still {{from time to time}} capable of a false rhyme, like morn and dawn. As for the author of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' her syntax was such a snare to her that it {{sometimes}} needed the combined skill of all the proof-readers and the assistant editor to extricate her. Of course, nothing was ever written into her work, but in changes of diction, in correction of solecisms, in transposition of phrases, the text was largely rewritten on the margin of her proofs. The soul of her art was present, but the form was so often absent, that when it was clothed on anew, it would have been hard to say whose cut the garment was of in many places. In fact, the proof-reading of the 'Atlantic Monthly' was something almost fearfully scrupulous and perfect. The proofs were first read by the under proof-reader in the printing-office; then the head reader passed them to me perfectly clean as to typography, with his own abundant and most intelligent comments on the literature; and then I read them, making what changes I chose, and verifying every quotation, every date, every geographical and biographical name, every foreign word to the last accent, every technical and scientific term. Where it was possible or at all desirable the proof was next submitted to the author. When it came back to me, I revised it, accepting or rejecting the author's judgment according as he was entitled by his ability and knowledge or not to have them. The proof now went to the printers for correction; they sent it again to the head reader, who carefully revised it and returned it again to me. I read it a second time, and it was again corrected. After this it was revised in the office and sent to the <b>stereotyper,</b> from whom it came to the head reader for a last revision in the plates.|$|E

25|$|By the 1900s {{printing}} plants often incorporated electrotyping and stereotyping departments, and electrotyping and stereotyping {{had become}} trades with associated apprenticeships. In the United Kingdom, the National Society of Electrotypers and <b>Stereotypers</b> (NSES) formed in 1893, {{and continued to}} 1967 when it amalgamated with the National Graphic Association. In the US and Canada, the International <b>Stereotypers</b> and Electrotypers Union (ISEU) was formed in 1902; previously, electrotypers had belonged to the International Typographer's Union (ITU). In 1925 there were 6800 members, and in 1955 10,500. In 1973 the ISEU was absorbed into the International Printing and Graphic Communications Union. In 1978, an Occupational Outlook Handbook reported that 2000 electrotypers and <b>stereotypers</b> were employed in the US. However, job prospects were reported as poor. Offset printing has supplanted letterpress printing in most printing plants; the last letterpress facility for a newspaper was installed in the 1980s. For offset printing, the printing plates are typically prepared by coating them with light-sensitive materials, and creating {{the image on the}} plate by direct optical exposure (the photo-offset process); stereotyping and electrotyping are not used.|$|R

His first showing of his inventions occurred at the Chicago World Fair in which he displayed his newly invented and developed, <b>stereotyper,</b> in 1893.

5000|$|Social groups {{typically}} {{are associated with}} {{both positive and negative}} stereotypes. For example, women are positively stereotyped as warm but negatively stereotyped as weak; Asian-Americans are positively stereotyped as competent but negatively stereotyped as cold; Black Americans are positively stereotyped as athletic, but negatively stereotyped as unintelligent. An individual targeted by a positive stereotype associated with their social group may assume that the <b>stereotyper</b> also believes they possess the negative stereotypes associated with the group. [...] The negative stereotype that is assumed to be held by the <b>stereotyper</b> depends on to what social group the positive stereotype references. In a study by Siy & Cheryan (2016), Asian-American men were either exposed to a positive stereotype about their race (e.g., “Asians are ambitious) or their gender (e.g., “Men are ambitious”). Asian men that were positively stereotyped based on their gender were more likely to believe that negative gender stereotypes (e.g., aggressive, dominant) were also being applied to them than those who were only targets of positive racial stereotypes. In a similar manner, Asian men that were targets of positive racial stereotypes were more likely to believe that negative racial stereotypes (e.g., bad at driving, bad at English) were also being applied to them.|$|E

According to Larson, when Helen Keller learned that Hall was {{the inventor of the}} Braille typewriter she used, she hugged and kissed him. Larson added that retelling the story always brought Hall to tears. She was later integral to the establishment of the practice buy learning multiple codes in order to read and write.|$|E

5000|$|This {{invention}} {{took the}} place of more laborious devices used for instruction. Students were regularly using slate or metal frame to guide a stylus or punch held in the hand. Hall created an instrument that adapted its stripping capabilities to produce a <b>Stereotyper</b> metal plate from which multiple copies could be made. This system was built upon the previous and more established models however with key differences. One such difference {{was the creation of}} non-impressed metal holdings, which subsequently lead to a termed, [...] "Battle of the Dots".

50|$|He {{was born}} in Oswego County, New York, United States, in 1821. He had a sibling: Irwin Pedro Beadle (1826-1882). They were the grandsons of Benjamin Beadle, a Revolutionary War soldier. After a {{temporary}} move to Michigan, the Beadle family returned to New York, and lived in Chautauqua County, New York. Erastus worked for a miller named Hayes, where he began his printing career when cutting wooden letters to label bags of grain. In 1838, he was apprenticed to H & E Phinney, a publishing firm in Cooperstown, New York. There he learned typesetting, stereotyping, binding, and engraving. He married Mary Ann Pennington in 1846, and in 1847 the couple moved to Buffalo, New York, where Erastus worked as a <b>stereotyper.</b> In 1849 Irwin went to Buffalo too, and found {{a job as a}} bookbinder. The next year, the brothers set up their own stereotype foundry. Irwin left the company in 1856 and went to the Nebraska Territory where he acted as a secretary for a company settling the town of Saratoga. The town was busted in 1857, and Beadle returned to Nebraska shortly thereafter.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that people subtly conform more to ingroup members who use stereotype-consistent rather than stereotype-inconsistent {{information}} when describing an outgroup member (Castelli, Vanzetto, Sherman, & Arcuri, 2001). In the present article, we will address two important issues. First, we will examine whether this subtle conformity toward <b>stereotypers</b> is related to individuals’ prejudice level (Study 1). Second, we will examine one of the processes that underlie the perception of ingroup members who use stereotype-consistent information, hypothesizing that individuals implicitly feel more similar to such sources than to ingroup members who use stereotype-inconsistent information (Study 2). Both hypotheses were confirmed and results are discussed in terms of the distinction between implicit and explicit attitudes and their implications in the maintenance of social stereotypes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInterpersonal {{dynamics}} {{may play}} a crucial role in the perpetuation of stereotypes. In an experimental study, participants interacted with a confederate who provided either stereotype-consistent or stereotype-inconsistent descriptions about the elderly. Based on the assumption that mimicry represents a social glue that fosters interpersonal liking and affiliation, we assessed the extent to which participants mimicked the nonverbal behaviors of the confederate as a function of the stereotypicality of the descriptions. Results showed that nonconscious mimicry was more likely when the speaker relied on stereotypes rather than on stereotype-inconsistent information. In Study 2 the effect was replicated in relation to national stereotypes. This finding indicates that <b>stereotypers</b> are faced with subtle nonverbal cues from the audience that can retroactively reinforce their behaviors and thus make stereotype dismissal so difficult to be achieved...|$|R
