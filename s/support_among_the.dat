In an effort to consolidate his hold on the provinces, and especially the two Asian themes still loyal to him, Michael proclaimed a 25 percent reduction in taxes for 821–822.|$|E

Pyrrhus pursued AntigonusII in the Peloponnese, yet AntigonusII was ultimately able to recapture Macedonia. Pyrrhus was killed while besieging Argos in 272BC, allowing AntigonusII to reclaim the rest of Greece. He then restored the Argead dynastic graves at Aigai and annexed the Kingdom of Paeonia.|$|E
5|$|The Safavid emperor Tahmasp I ransacked {{the monastery}} in 1534. In 1648, {{along with other}} {{buildings}} in the region, Varagavank was destroyed by an earthquake. Its restoration began immediately thereafter by monastery father Kirakos who found financial <b>support</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> wealthy merchants in Van. According to the 17th-century historian Arakel of Tabriz, four churches were restored and renovated.|$|E
5|$|Having been proclaimed emperor {{solely on}} the {{initiative}} of the Senate, Nerva had to introduce a number of measures to gain <b>support</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Roman populace. As was custom by this time, a change of emperor was expected to bring with it a generous payment of gifts and money {{to the people and}} the army. Accordingly, a congiarium of 75 denarii per head was bestowed upon the citizens, while the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard received a donativum which may have amounted to as much as 5000 denarii per person. This was followed by a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the most needy Romans.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, choral {{associations}} became common in Maryland, and Baltimore, {{buoyed by the}} immigration of numerous Germans. These groups were formed {{for the purpose of}} instruction in choral music, eventually performing oratorios. The popularity of these choral associations helped to garner <b>support</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> local population for putting music education in the city's public schools. The Baltimore Oratorio Society, the Liederkranz and the Germania Männerchor were {{the most important of these}} associations, and their traditions were maintained into the 20th century by organizations like the Bach Choir, Choral Arts Society, Concert Artists of Baltimore, Handel Society and the Baltimore Symphony Chorus.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{compares the}} executions of Domitian to those under Emperor Claudius (41–55), noting that Claudius {{executed}} around 35 senators and 300 equestrians, and yet was still deified by the Senate and {{regarded as one}} of the good Emperors of history. Domitian was apparently unable to gain <b>support</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> aristocracy, despite attempts to appease hostile factions with consular appointments. His autocratic style of government accentuated the Senate's loss of power, while his policy of treating patricians and even family members as equals to all Romans earned him their contempt.|$|E
5|$|Mufarrij {{also tried}} to win <b>support</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Christians, and {{possibly}} curry the favour of the Byzantine Empire as well, by sponsoring works to restore the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which had only recently been demolished on the orders of al-Hakim, and by arranging the re-appointment of a Patriarch to the vacant see. In general, the Jarrahids {{seem to have had}} close relations with the Christians and maintained contact with Byzantium, a fact which would play a role in later events.|$|E

5|$|Nasser's {{return to}} Egypt coincided with Husni al-Za'im's Syrian coup d'état. Its success and evident popular <b>support</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Syrian people {{encouraged}} Nasser's revolutionary pursuits. Soon after his return, he was summoned and interrogated by Prime Minister Ibrahim Abdel Hadi regarding suspicions {{that he was}} forming a secret group of dissenting officers. According to secondhand reports, Nasser convincingly denied the allegations. Abdel Hadi was also hesitant to take drastic measures against the army, especially in front of its chief of staff, who was present during the interrogation, and subsequently released Nasser. The interrogation pushed Nasser to speed up his group's activities.|$|E
5|$|Pyrrhus {{lost much}} of his <b>support</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Macedonians in 273 BC when his unruly Gallic mercenaries plundered the royal {{cemetery}} of Aigai. Pyrrhus pursued Antigonus II in Greece, yet while he was occupied with {{the war in the}} Peloponnese, Antigonus II was able to recapture Macedonia. While battling for control over Argos in 272 BC, Pyrrhus was killed while fighting in the city's streets, allowing Antigonus II to reclaim Greece as well. He then restored the Argead dynastic graves at Aigai by constructing a massive tumulus. Antigonus II also secured the Illyrian front and annexed Paeonia.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, the Friends of the Constitution (Zgromadzenie Przyjaciół Konstytucji Rządowej)which {{included}} many {{participants in the}} Great Sejmwas organised to defend the reforms already enacted and to promote further ones. It is now regarded as the first modern-style political party in Poland's history. The response to the new constitution was less enthusiastic in the provinces, where the Hetmans' Party enjoyed considerable influence. General <b>support</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> middle nobility was crucial and still very substantial; most of the provincial sejmiks deliberating in 1791 and early 1792 supported the constitution.|$|E

5|$|The German {{occupation}} administration repressed {{political dissent}} and launched numerous unpopular measures, including the deportation of Belgian workers to Germany and forced labour on military projects. It also supported the radical Flemish Movement by making numerous concessions {{as part of}} the Flamenpolitik in an attempt to gain <b>support</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> country's Flemish population. As a result, numerous resistance movements were founded which attempted to sabotage military infrastructure, collect intelligence for the Allies or print underground newspapers. Low-level expressions of dissent were common although frequently repressed.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after his last meeting with the CIA, he led an assault against Matamoros along {{with a handful of}} supporters. The attack failed, and Castillo Armas was wounded and arrested. A year later, he bribed his way out of prison, and escaped back to Honduras. The {{engineer}} dispatched by the CIA to liaise with Castillo Armas informed them that Castillo Armas had the financial backing of Somoza and Trujillo. US President Harry S. Truman thereupon authorized Operation PBFORTUNE. Castillo Armas's stories of his revolt and escape from prison proved popular among the right-wing exiles in Honduras. Among these people, Castillo Armas claimed to still have <b>support</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> army, and began planning another revolt. His reputation was inflated by stories that he had escaped from prison through a tunnel.|$|E
5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's <b>support</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E

5|$|In 1623, Galileo {{published}} The Assayer—Il Saggiatore, which attacked theories {{based on}} Aristotle's authority and promoted experimentation and the mathematical formulation of scientific ideas. The book was highly successful and even found <b>support</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> higher echelons of the Christian church. Following {{the success of}} The Assayer, Galileo published the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo) in 1632. Despite taking care {{to adhere to the}} Inquisition's 1616 instructions, the claims in the book favouring Copernican theory and a non Geocentric model of the solar system led to Galileo being tried and banned on publication. Despite the publication ban, Galileo published his Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences (Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuove scienze) in 1638 in Holland, outside the jurisdiction of the Inquisition.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, when Congressman Benjamin Parke {{resigned}} from office, Harrison ordered {{a special election}} to fill the vacancy. Jennings entered the race against Harrison's candidate, Thomas Randolph, the attorney general for the territory, and John Johnson, a Vincennes native who {{had the support of}} the antislavery group. Randolph promised not to introduce slavery into the territory unless the majority of his constituents agreed, while Johnson remained silent on the issue. Jennings, an antislavery candidate from the eastern portion of the territory, rode from settlement to settlement to give speeches against slavery. Jennings spoke against what he believed to be Randolph's aristocratic tendencies, ties to Harrison's territorial government, and the issue of slavery in the territory. Jennings found his greatest <b>support</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> growing Quaker community {{in the eastern part of}} the territory.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Lancaster Street, {{which had}} {{previously}} ended at Willett Street opposite the park, was extended through to Northern Boulevard (today Henry Johnson Boulevard). Associated with this extension Northern Boulevard was also widened and both Lancaster and State streets were turned into one-ways. Entrances to Washington Park from Thurlow Terrace and Englewood Place were closed in 1972 turning those into dead end streets from Western Avenue. In 1988 Washington Park Road was renamed Albany Plan of Union Avenue {{in honor of}} the colonial congress held in Albany by Benjamin Franklin that proposed closer ties and <b>support</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Thirteen Colonies. In 1991 Northern Boulevard from its intersection with Madison Avenue and Willett Street north through the park and continuing to Livingston Avenue in Arbor Hill was renamed Henry Johnson Boulevard in honor of African-American World WarI hero Henry Johnson.|$|E
