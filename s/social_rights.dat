5|$|The U.S. State {{department}} {{considers that}} “discrimination against women {{is a significant}} problem” in Saudi Arabia and that women have few political or <b>social</b> <b>rights.</b> After her 2008 visit, the UN special rapporteur on violence against women noted the lack of women's autonomy {{and the absence of}} a law criminalizing violence against women. The World Economic Forum 2012 Global Gender Gap Report ranked Saudi Arabia 131st out of 135 countries for gender parity, ahead of Syria, Chad, Pakistan and Yemen.|$|E
5|$|Concepts of women's <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> {{and social}} status during the Tang era were notably liberal-minded for the period. However, this was largely {{reserved}} for urban women of elite status, {{as men and women}} in the rural countryside labored hard in their different set of tasks; with wives and daughters responsible for more domestic tasks of weaving textiles and rearing of silk worms, while men tended to farming in the fields. There were many women in the Tang era who gained access to religious authority by taking vows as Daoist priestesses. The head mistresses of the bordellos in the North Hamlet of the capital Chang'an acquired large amounts of wealth and power. Their high-class courtesans, who likely influenced the Japanese geishas, were well respected. These courtesans were known as great singers and poets, supervised banquets and feasts, knew the rules to all the drinking games, and were trained to have the utmost respectable table manners.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Social</b> <b>Right</b> {{was created}} in 2011 by Laurent Wauquiez and other UMP parliamentarians who wanted to {{emphasize}} the <b>right's</b> <b>social</b> policy, appeal to the middle-class and break the left's purported domination of social policy.

25|$|The {{history of}} Dutch {{nationality}} is {{the emergence of}} a sense of national identity in the territory of the Netherlands. Consciousness of national identity was manifested through shared national obligations and rights such as taxation, military service, political and <b>social</b> <b>rights,</b> but most importantly through the concept of citizenship. Dutch nationality was forged through conflict which helped the people of the Low Countries develop a unifying idea of the Netherlander.|$|E

25|$|During Juan Domingo Perón's {{government}} the Argentine Constitution of 1949 was successfully passed, a major {{revision of the}} constitution.

Also, it permitted the indefinite reelection of the president.|$|E

25|$|Roosevelt saw the Economic Bill of Rights as {{something}} that would, at least initially, be implemented by legislation, {{but that did not}} exclude either the US Supreme Court's development of constitutional jurisprudence or amendments to the US Constitution. Roosevelt's model assumed that federal government would take the lead, but that did not prevent states improving their own legislative or constitutional framework beyond the federal minimum. Much of the groundwork had been laid before and during the New Deal but left many of the Second Bill of Rights' aspirations incomplete. Internationally, the same economic and <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> were written into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.|$|E
25|$|The text {{prepared}} by Ambedkar provided constitutional guarantees and protections {{for a wide}} range of civil liberties for individual citizens, including freedom of religion, the abolition of untouchability, and the outlawing of all forms of discrimination. Ambedkar argued for extensive economic and <b>social</b> <b>rights</b> for women, and won the Assembly's support for introducing a system of reservations of jobs in the civil services, schools and colleges for members of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and Other Backward Class, a system akin to affirmative action. India's lawmakers hoped to eradicate the socio-economic inequalities and lack of opportunities for India's depressed classes through these measures. The Constitution was adopted on 26 November 1949 by the Constituent Assembly.|$|E
25|$|Techniques used to {{suppress}} the ethnic identity of Kurds in Syria include various bans {{on the use of}} the Kurdish language, refusal to register children with Kurdish names, the replacement of Kurdish place names with new names in Arabic, the prohibition of businesses that do not have Arabic names, the prohibition of Kurdish private schools, and the prohibition of books and other materials written in Kurdish. Having been denied the right to Syrian nationality, around three-hundred thousand Kurds have been deprived of any <b>social</b> <b>rights,</b> in violation of international law. As a consequence, these Kurds are in effect trapped within Syria. In February 2006, however, sources reported that Syria was now planning to grant these Kurds citizenship.|$|E
