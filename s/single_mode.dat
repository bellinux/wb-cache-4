5|$|Introduced in HDMI 1.4, HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel (HEAC) adds a {{high-speed}} bidirectional data communication link (HEC) {{and the ability}} to send audio data upstream to the source device (ARC). HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector: the previously unused Reserved pin (called HEAC+) and the Hot Plug Detect pin (called HEAC−). If only ARC transmission is required, a <b>single</b> <b>mode</b> signal using the HEAC+ line can be used, otherwise, HEC is transmitted as a differential signal over the pair of lines, and ARC as a common mode component of the pair.|$|E
5|$|Much {{progress}} has been made in the power scaling lasers and amplifiers produced with ytterbium (Yb) doped optical fibers. Power levels have increased from the 1kW regimes due to the advancements in components as well as the Yb-doped fibers. Fabrication of Low NA, Large Mode Area fibers enable achievement of near perfect beam qualities (M2<1.1) at power levels of 1.5 kW to greater than 2 kW at ~1064 nm in a broadband configuration. Ytterbium-doped LMA fibers also have the advantages of a larger mode field diameter, which negates the impacts of nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering and stimulated Raman scattering, which limit the achievement of higher power levels, and provide a distinct advantage over <b>single</b> <b>mode</b> ytterbium-doped fibers.|$|E

25|$|Most <b>single</b> <b>mode</b> / multi mode fiber systems {{actually}} use infra-red light, {{invisible to the}} human eye. In this case, there is no 'eye aversion response". A special case is systems operating at 670–1000nbsp&nm, where the beam {{may appear to be}} a dull red, even if the light beam is actually very intense. Technicians may also use red lasers for fault finding at around 628–670nbsp&nm. These can create a significant hazard if viewed incorrectly, particularly if they are abnormally high power. Such visible fault finders are usually classified as Classnbsp&2 up to 1nbsp&mW, and Classnbsp&2M up to 10nbsp&mW.|$|E

25|$|Attraction {{between the}} plates {{can be easily}} {{understood}} {{by focusing on the}} one-dimensional situation. Suppose that a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance a from one of two widely separated plates (distance L apart). With a << L, the states within the slot of width a are highly constrained so that the energy E of any one mode is widely separated from that of the next. This is not the case in the large region L, where there is a large number (numbering about L / a) of states with energy evenly spaced between E and the next mode in the narrow slot ndash& in other words, all slightly larger than E. Now on shortening a by da (< 0), the mode in the narrow slot shrinks in wavelength and therefore increases in energy proportional to minus&da/a, whereas all the L /a states that lie in the large region lengthen and correspondingly decrease their energy by an amount proportional to da/L (note the denominator). The two effects nearly cancel, but the net change is slightly negative, because the energy of all the L/a modes in the large region are slightly larger than the <b>single</b> <b>mode</b> in the slot. Thus the force is attractive: it tends to make a slightly smaller, the plates attracting each other across the thin slot.|$|E
500|$|This {{multiplicity}} of modes can cause problems in waveguide filters when spurious modes are generated. [...] Designs are usually {{based on a}} <b>single</b> <b>mode</b> and frequently incorporate features to suppress the unwanted modes. [...] On the other hand, advantage can be had from choosing the right mode for the application, and even sometimes making use {{of more than one}} mode at once. [...] Where only a <b>single</b> <b>mode</b> is in use, the waveguide can be modelled like a conducting transmission line and results from transmission line theory can be applied.|$|E
500|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} waveguide filter design concerns {{the mode of}} transmission. [...] Systems based on pairs of conducting wires and similar technologies have only one mode of transmission. [...] In waveguide systems, any number of modes are possible. [...] This can be both a disadvantage, as spurious modes frequently cause problems, and an advantage, as a dual-mode design can be {{much smaller than the}} equivalent waveguide <b>single</b> <b>mode</b> design. [...] The chief advantages of waveguide filters over other technologies are their ability to handle high power and their low loss. [...] The chief disadvantages are their bulk and cost when compared with technologies such as microstrip filters.|$|E

40|$|Three {{different}} dosing <b>modes,</b> {{including one}} <b>single</b> dosing <b>mode</b> and two sequential dosing modes, were applied in high-arsenic contaminated water treatment. The results illustrated that the As (V) soluble and the As (V) nonspecifically sorbed were the insignificant species from Fe-As (V) samples in the sequential dosing mode, {{while they were}} higher in the <b>single</b> dosing <b>mode.</b> However, it could be further concluded that the mobility of the Fe-As (V) in sequential dosing mode was greater than that in <b>single</b> dosing <b>mode.</b> Besides, the main arsenic speciation governing the arsenic-borne coagulates was the As (V) associated with poorly crystalline hydrous oxides of Fe in sequential or <b>single</b> dosing <b>mode.</b> Moreover, the particle size distribution analysis indicated that the sequential dosing mode was more prevalent in neutralizing and adsorbing the As (V) compared with the <b>single</b> dosing <b>mode.</b> In the FT-IR spectra, the presence of arsenic was highlighted by a well resolved band at 825 – 829 cm− 1. The positions of the As–O stretching vibration bands were shifted gradually as the dosing mode changed from the single to the sequential. This result could be related to the distribution of arsenic speciation in different dosing modes...|$|R
2500|$|High power optical {{amplifiers}} {{are used}} in long distance systems. They use internal pump lasers with power levels up a few watts, which is a major hazard. However these power levels are contained within the amplifier module. Any system employing typical optical connectors (i.e. not expanded beam) cannot typically exceed about 100nbsp&mW, above which power level <b>single</b> <b>mode</b> connectors become unreliable, so {{if there is a}} <b>single</b> <b>mode</b> connector in the system, the design power level will always be below this level, even if no other details are known [...] An additional factor with these systems is that light around the 1550nbsp&nm wavelength band (common for optical amplifiers) is regarded as relatively low risk, since the eye fluids absorb the light before it is focused on the retina. This tends to reduce the overall risk factor of such systems.|$|E
