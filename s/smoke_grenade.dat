5|$|The scenes {{featuring}} Berry in {{a bikini}} were shot in Cádiz. The location was reportedly cold and windy, and footage {{has been released}} of Berry wrapped in thick towels between takes to avoid catching a chill. Berry was injured during filming when debris from a <b>smoke</b> <b>grenade</b> flew into her eye. The debris was removed in a 30-minute operation.|$|E
5|$|Both {{factions in}} Day of Defeat: Source {{have access to}} six classes. Each class is {{designed}} with specific combat circumstances in mind, so that teams must use teamwork to succeed. The weapons and equipment carried by the classes {{are based on the}} weapons used by both the US Army and Wehrmacht during World War II. Some of classes are armed with pistols—the American M1911 or the German Walther P38—while others are equipped with trench knives or entrenching tools for melee combat. Grenades are carried by a number of classes, depending on their role in the game—riflemen are equipped with rifle grenades, the assault classes are armed with a single fragmentation grenade and a <b>smoke</b> <b>grenade</b> for providing concealment, while support classes have access to two standard fragmentation grenades. Riflemen are armed with the M1 Garand or the Karabiner 98 kurz and are designed for medium to long range combat, while the assault classes carries the M1 Thompson or the MP40 which are only effective in close quarters. The support classes are designed for medium range combat, equipped with either the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle or the StG44. Snipers are used for attacking enemy targets from long range, and are consequently armed with the Springfield M1903 or the Karabiner 98k both equipped with long range scopes. Machine gunners carries the M1919 Browning or the MG42 to defend key locations on a level or to provide a base of fire for their team's advance. Machine gunners are required to deploy their weapons on bipods before firing in order to compensate for the machine gun's extreme recoil. The final class is armed with a Bazooka or a Panzerschreck, used in the game to displace enemy machine gun or sniper positions. This class is armed with either an M1 carbine or Mauser M712 to defend themselves with when moving.|$|E
25|$|Terephthalic acid {{is used as}} {{a filler}} in some {{military}} smoke grenades, most notably the American M83 <b>smoke</b> <b>grenade</b> and M90 vehicle-employed <b>smoke</b> <b>grenade,</b> producing a thick white smoke that acts as an obscurant in the visual and near-infrared spectrum when burned.|$|E
50|$|<b>Smoke</b> <b>grenades,</b> {{also used}} in {{military}} and law enforcement training, may be allowed in a paintball game. In tournament paintball the use of <b>smoke</b> <b>grenades</b> or any other explosive is strictly prohibited. The grenades create a screen of smoke which can obscure the movement of players {{and make it more}} difficult for the opposition to hit them. Some large-scale scenarios use military-issue <b>smoke</b> <b>grenades,</b> but for recreational use, smaller commercial 'smokes' are preferred (due mainly to cost and convenience).|$|R
50|$|<b>Smoke</b> <b>grenades</b> {{can also}} be used to signal aircraft. Since {{locating}} a target from above (especially in thick forest canopy) can be nearly impossible, even with good radio contact, colored <b>smoke</b> <b>grenades</b> are often used to allow aircraft to spot them. Colored signalling <b>smoke</b> <b>grenades</b> are widely used in CASEVAC and close air support situations where quickly locating friendly ground forces is of paramount importance. Common colors are red, yellow, green and purple, and all use very brightly colored dyes to increase the likelihood of being spotted from above.|$|R

50|$|<b>Smoke</b> <b>grenades</b> {{are used}} as ground-to-ground or ground-to-air {{signalling}} devices, target or landing zone marking devices, {{and to create a}} smoke-screen for concealment. The body is a sheet-steel cylinder with emission holes in the top and bottom. These allow the smoke to be released when the grenade is ignited. There are two main types, one producing coloured smoke for signaling, and the other for screening smoke. In coloured <b>smoke</b> <b>grenades,</b> the filler consists of 250 to 350 grams of coloured smoke mixture (mostly potassium chlorate, lactose and a dye). Screening <b>smoke</b> <b>grenades</b> usually contain HC (hexachloroethane/zinc) smoke mixture or TA (terephthalic acid) smoke mixture. HC smoke contains hydrochloric acid and is harmful to breathe. These grenades can become hot enough to scald or burn unprotected skin.|$|R
