30|$|Due to {{shortage}} of natural organic matters in arid and semi-arid regions, {{the use of}} organic polymers to improve soil structure was very important {{over the past years}} and these polymers have shown their ability as <b>soil</b> amendments. In <b>fact,</b> <b>soil</b> management practices encourage the addition of organic matter to the soil which has significant effect on soil physical and chemical properties (Weyers and Spokas 2014).|$|R
30|$|A {{variety of}} {{sciences}} such as classical statistics, geostatistics, remote sensing, {{geographical information systems}} (GIS), soil science, and hydrology are employed to precisely assess the heavy metal content of <b>soils.</b> In <b>fact,</b> <b>soil</b> pollution can currently be well determined using GIS and geostatistical methods. While classical statistical methods have been widely applied in previous studies on soil contamination, such methods are expensive and time-consuming and do not calculate estimation errors. Besides, preparing sufficient samples from the areas under-study is impossible. Hence, geostatistical methods have replaced classical statistics as they can accurately identify time and spatial changes of pollutants and calculate estimation error (Blom 1985; Bonham-carter et al. 1987).|$|R
50|$|If {{the soil}} is not fully saturated, it {{contains}} air pockets. The permeability is reduced due {{to the presence of}} air which causes a blockage to the passage of water. Consequently, the permeability of a partially saturated soil is considerably smaller than that of fully saturated <b>soil.</b> In <b>fact,</b> Darcy's Law is not strictly applicable to such soils.|$|R
5000|$|By 1790 {{the records}} show that the parish of Beath had about 100 {{families}} whose livelihood came mainly from the <b>soil.</b> The <b>fact</b> that Beath Church served a very large area {{led to the creation}} of many [...] "kirke roads", roads that form rights-of-way even today. This church was replaced by the present church, built in 1832 and enlarged in 1886.|$|R
5000|$|Like most Ericaceae, Erica {{species are}} mainly calcifuges, being limited to acidic or very acidic <b>soils.</b> In <b>fact,</b> the term [...] "ericaceous" [...] is {{frequently}} {{applied to all}} calcifuges, and to the compost used in their cultivation. Soils range from dry, sandy soils to extremely wet ones such as bog. They often dominate dwarf-shrub habitats (heathland and moorland), or the ground vegetation of open acidic woodland.|$|R
5000|$|Benefits from Chloris gayana {{can also}} be found in the plant's growth. The [...] "seed germinates quickly (1-7 days) {{depending}} on temperature." [...] In addition to this, it [...] "often achieves full ground cover within three months of sowing." [...] This too is good for farmers when it comes to covering bare <b>soil.</b> The <b>fact</b> that Chloris gayana can grow quickly means that farmers could use it to protect the soil from eroding.|$|R
5000|$|By the Late Devonian , trees such as Archaeopteris were so {{abundant}} {{that they}} changed river systems from mostly braided to mostly meandering, because their roots bound the <b>soil</b> firmly. In <b>fact,</b> they caused the [...] "Late Devonian wood crisis" [...] because: ...|$|R

30|$|Owing to the {{astonishing}} diversity of microorganisms present in <b>soils</b> and the <b>fact</b> that approximately only 1 % {{of them could}} be cultured in laboratory conditions (Amann et al. 1995), a culture-independent method to identify and compare microbial communities in soil with and without B. pseudomallei was used.|$|R
40|$|The Apollo 16 {{crystalline}} rocks have {{a greater}} average percentage of metallic iron than any other lunar material and are the most reduced {{in terms of their}} metallic iron/total iron ratio. They have greater metal content than the mare basalts, the only primary igneous rocks on the moon, and more iron metal than the associated Apollo 16 breccias and <b>soils.</b> This <b>fact</b> and the relatively coarse grain size suggest reduction of the iron during the formation of the crystalline rocks, probably during melts and partial melts in an impact base surge deposit...|$|R
5000|$|The GCMS {{measured}} {{no significant}} amount of organic molecules in the Martian <b>soil.</b> In <b>fact,</b> Martian <b>soils</b> were found to contain less carbon than lifeless lunar soils returned by the Apollo program. This result was difficult to explain if Martian bacterial metabolism {{was responsible for the}} positive results seen by the Labeled Release experiment (see below). A 2011 astrobiology textbook notes that this was the decisive factor due to which [...] "For most of the Viking scientists, the final conclusion was that the Viking missions failed to detect life in the Martian soil." ...|$|R
5000|$|K. rotunda {{is found}} {{in various parts of}} India and {{adjoining}} regions, but seldom in the wild. The plant is groomed in small herbal nurseries for applications in medicine preparation. As its Sanskrit name bhumi champa (bloom from within earth) implies, the indigo-coloured flower shoots from within the <b>soil.</b> In <b>fact,</b> the flower emerges much in advance of the whitish leafy shoot. The flower and leaf are never seen at the same time. The flower contains the toxin benzyl benzoate used to make ointments to treat scabies. [...] It has potential antioxidant effects.|$|R
40|$|Profitable corn {{production}} requires adequate {{amounts of}} plant-available phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in the soil. Deficiencies of these nutrients {{are not a}} problem in many Iowa <b>soils.</b> In <b>fact,</b> recent soil-test summaries and surveys show that fertilization practices have increased initially low values of P and K in most soils to levels higher than needed to maximize yields. Additional studies indicate that applying P or K fertilizers to corn and soybeans grown on soils testing high in these nutrients is not profitable, Consequently, evaluating excess P and K is now more important than evaluating P and K deficiencies...|$|R

30|$|Soil {{iron oxides}} were {{recently}} shown to preferentially sequester oxidized and highly unsaturated organic molecules, rich in aromatic rings, polyphenols and carboxyl groups [26]. The formation of Fe–O–C bonds in stable [27] and large-sized organometallic amorphous complexes [28] had likely the effect {{to enhance the}} recalcitrance of the soil humeome that is intended as the totality of humic molecules present in <b>soil.</b> In <b>fact,</b> organic compounds bound to iron were extracted by Humeomics technique, a sequential chemical fractionation developed to characterize the molecular composition of a humified matter, only after stable molecular components had been progressively uncovered by first hydrolyzing ester and ether fractions [29].|$|R

40|$|For {{constant}} atmospheric {{boundary conditions}} {{the process of}} shrinkage of a cohesive soil is mainly dependent on the mineralogy of the clay particles and the particle size distribution of the soil. They both influence the hydraulic and mechanic as well as dielectric parameters of the soil. Concerning shrinkage, the most important parameters are the matric suction {{and the strength of}} the soil which are both dependent on the water content and the density of the <b>soil.</b> In <b>fact,</b> water content and density themselves influence the surface bonding forces acting on the water phase of the soil which are in turn not only causative for shrinkage, but also for the frequency dependent dielectric behavior of its parameters...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} is concerned on {{the analysis of}} the sorption behavior of chloride and potassium íons, in potassium chloride compounds, by means of batch tests using lateritic soils and kaolinitic materials. The applied methodology consisted on the acquisition of laboratorial procedures, where the samples werecharacterizedaccording to their chemical, physical and mineralogical characteristics. Later on, batch tests were accomplished. The analytical results show that the chloride presents a higher mobility than the potassium for both studied materials. It can be concluded that in most KCl solutions, the kaolinitic material adsorbed a higher amount of potassium than the lateritic <b>soil.</b> This <b>fact</b> can be explained by values of sortive complex and the supremacy of negative superficial charges...|$|R
30|$|Three new {{oleaginous}} yeast strains {{were isolated}} from soil samples arising from a peat bog and grassland using Sudan Black B staining on agar plates. The reason for peat bog <b>soil</b> was the <b>fact</b> that it contains high {{amount of carbon}} arising from old wood and plants while nitrogen content is low. The use of a grassland sample was chosen as a comparison sample without any specific limitations.|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} is this: {{where do we}} draw the line between private ownership and the public domain? It {{is not a question}} of choosing between copyright and patent, of choosing between hardware and software, or of choosing between implementation and algorithm. It is a more fundamental question that reaches back to ancient human values and transcends our current fixation on computers and software. It helps to put things in perspective. When debating where we and the law are headed (as we are now), it helps to know where we have been. In this regard, do not assume that software patents are newtrodden <b>soil.</b> In <b>fact,</b> software patents have been around longer than you might think. What was the first software patent? The answer may surprise you...|$|R
50|$|Methylmercury {{is a type}} {{of mercury}} that is liquid at room temperature. The {{methylmercury}} is used for the preservation of grains that are used for animal food. The methylmercury is obtained through the methylation of the mercury with the presence of anaerobic bacteria in the waters as well as sediments and <b>soils.</b> In <b>fact,</b> most microbes that live in lakes, rivers, oceans are able to create the methylmercury. Methylmercury has different ways of transferring itself. In fact, methylmercury is transferred through maternal milk during breast feeding. This methylmercury in breast feeding milk is transferred through fatty cells that allows the methylmercury to be transported through the milk. Another way of transportation would be the placenta barrier that allows the methylmercury to be accumulated at the fetus levels.|$|R
40|$|Expansive {{soils are}} some of the most widely {{distributed}} and costly of geological hazards. This study examined ASTER satellite data, combined with standard remote sensing techniques, namely band ratios, in identifying these soils. Ratios designed to detect various clay minerals were calculated and possible expansive soils were detected, especially in the pans. It was also possible to delineate the mudrock that may act as a source for expansive soils. Moisture content clearly affected the ratios and it shows that remote sensing can detect where wetness leads to the development of problem <b>soils.</b> The <b>fact</b> that the area has relatively dry climatic conditions may explain why large areas of the mudrock have not yet weathered to clays. Because the ratios are not unique, results can be ambiguous, so care must be taken in the interpretation phase. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{infectivity}} {{tests were}} repeated {{and the average}} results obtained indicated that more than 1 × 10 ^ 4 oospores per gram oven dry soil (OPG) caused damping-off of 80 % of Chenopodium quinoa seedlings. About 20 % damping-off occurred with 1 × 10 ^ 3 OPG. With 1 × 10 ^ 2 OPG the average was 6 %, and penetrating mycelium and oospores were easily recognized. Neither penetration nor disease incidence was found with 1 × 10 OPG. Thus, the minimum number of oospores capable of inducing disease {{was estimated to be}} 10 - 1 × 10 ^ 3 /g oven dry <b>soil.</b> The <b>fact</b> that P. zingiberum needs much more oospores than P. butleri to induce disease may be connected with lower germinability of oospores of the former...|$|R
50|$|Paulownia is {{an early}} colonizer of sterile soils (such as after a high {{temperature}} wildfire), because its seeds are easily killed off by <b>soil</b> fungi. In <b>fact,</b> {{it is so difficult}} to start Paulownia by seed that successful plantations purchase rootstock or seedlings—or propagate their own. Remarkably, despite the fact that seeds, seedlings, and roots of even mature trees are so susceptible to rot, the wood itself is not and is widely used for boat building and surfboards.|$|R

This {{chemical}} feature of HS improves physical soil properties favoring {{the formation of}} stable clay–humic aggregates through cation bridges, and soil fertility increasing mineral nutrient (P, Fe, Mn or Zn) availability for plants grown in alkaline and calcareous <b>soils</b> [15]. In <b>fact,</b> several studies have reported that a very significant fraction of Cu, Zn, Fe and Mn in soil solution from limy, alkaline soils was present {{in the form of}} complexes with DOM [16 – 18].|$|R

[...] This is one {{of those}} stories which, if resting upon no sufficient authority to compel its acceptance, will, nevertheless, resist all attempts at final refutation, having its roots at least in the <b>soil</b> of <b>fact.</b> It is given in the rather discredited Portuguese chronicles of Acenheiro, and finds place, more or less as related here, in Duarte Galvao's [...] "Chronicle of Affonso Henriques," [...] whence it was taken by the Portuguese historical writer, Alexandre Herculano, to be included in his [...] "Lendas e Narrativas." [...] If it is to be relegated to the Limbo of the ben trovato, at least I esteem it to afford us a precious glimpse of the naive spirit of the age in which it is set, and find in that my justification for including it.|$|R
30|$|The above discussions clarify that, {{although}} it was realised in the early development of the CSSM [43] that the compression response should be presented in a normalised stress plot [as in Eqs. (2) or (3)], it is surprising to note that no attempt {{has been made to}} define a proper normalising parameter for the compression behaviour of <b>soils.</b> In <b>fact</b> it is evident from many later publications that even the importance of the stress normalisation is often ignored (e.g. [2, 35]). This is mainly because most of the research on the CSSM was limited to clay, where the NCL is always assumed to be unique. In this case, the role of stress normalisation is merely to offset the NCL. However, in the case of sand, where a multitude of NCLs exist, proper normalisation is definitely be valuable.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} monks at Hanga quickly grew, though {{the number of}} monks ordained to the priesthood {{remained}} very small. Such large numbers presented difficulties for the early community, and made it challenging to match the ideal of a small, independent African monastery as had been envisioned by Abbot-Bishop Eberhard Spiess. In large part, this was because Hanga lacked any precedent. Thus, elements from existing Missionary Benedictine monasteries such as St Ottilien, Ndanda, and Peramiho were applied to the situation at Hanga. Self-sufficiency in these populous, culturally European monasteries was characterized by large-scale agricultural operations, artisanal work, {{and the practice of}} sophisticated trades. Such monasteries as Ndanda and Peramiho, though existing on African <b>soil,</b> in <b>fact</b> received personnel and support from Europe. With this in mind, the monks of Hanga struggled to rely solely on local resources and talents.|$|R
50|$|The vector for PMTV, S. subterranea, is a {{slime mold}} {{known to cause}} powdery scab disease that favors wet and humid conditions, {{specifically}} poorly drained <b>soil.</b> In <b>fact,</b> this disease doesn’t occur often in areas with less than 30 inches of rain per year. The chance of disease onset increases in areas that get more than 45 inches of rain per year. Such moist environments helps facilitate the vector's zoospore movement to the infection sites (roots and tubers). It is thought that powdery scab disease development increases when high soil moisture gradually dries out, as this increases zoospore germination. S. subterranea tends to prefer more acidic soil, ranging from pHs of 4.7 to 7.6. S. subterranea thrives in temperate conditions, between 52 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit, with the optimal temperature for infection by the vector being 60 degrees.|$|R
