5|$|The clutch size is two eggs, {{which is}} low for such small rails. The eggs are greyish milk white dotted with brown-rufous spots and lavender-mauve <b>spots</b> <b>that</b> are {{concentrated}} around {{the apex of}} the egg. They are large for the size of the mother compared to other rails, and resemble the eggs of the corn crake.|$|E
5|$|The {{exoskeleton}} {{is generally}} blue above, with <b>spots</b> <b>that</b> coalesce, and yellow below. The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red pigment astaxanthin {{is bound to}} a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment.|$|E
5|$|Considered {{the most}} {{specialized}} member of its family, the tasselled wobbegong's ornate coloration and complex dermal fringe grants it excellent camouflage, {{while it is}} probably a slower swimmer than related species. It is solitary and spends {{most of the day}} lying motionless inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled up. Individual sharks have a small home range, containing several preferred resting <b>spots</b> <b>that</b> are used repeatedly. This species becomes more active at night, swimming onto the reef to hunt.|$|E
5000|$|The {{length of}} the punt, {{referred}} to as punting yards or gross punting yards, is measured from {{the line of scrimmage}} (not the spot where the punter punts) to whichever of the following points applies: (1) the <b>spot</b> <b>that</b> a punt is caught; (2) the <b>spot</b> <b>that</b> a punt goes out of bounds; (3) the <b>spot</b> <b>that</b> a punt is declared dead because of illegal touching; or (4) the goal line, for punts that are ruled touchbacks.|$|R

5|$|The P. rebeli {{are noted}} for their large blue wings, with the males {{displaying}} a violet blue shade and the females displaying blue basal areas interspersed with brown spots, {{similar to other}} butterflies in its genus. The undersides of the butterfly are a dark brown with small black <b>spots</b> <b>that</b> are circled in white. It can be distinguished from its close relative, the P. alcon, by the broader black margins of the upperside male and the extensive blue basal areas in the females. It has a wingspan of approximately 32–36mm.|$|E
5|$|The cheetah {{is often}} {{confused}} with the leopard and the cougar and can be distinguished by its small round spots {{in contrast to the}} leopard's rosettes and the cougar's plain coat; in addition, the leopard lacks the tear streaks of the cheetah. The cougar possesses neither the tear streaks nor the spotted coat pattern of the cheetah. The serval has a form very {{similar to that of the}} cheetah but is significantly smaller. Moreover, it has a shorter tail and <b>spots</b> <b>that</b> fuse to form stripes on the back.|$|E
5|$|Dorsally, {{the color}} pattern {{consists}} of a deep yellow, tan, or brown ground color, with three series of dark brown <b>spots</b> <b>that</b> run {{the length of the}} body. Each of these spots has a black ring around it, the outer border of which is intensified with a rim of white or yellow. The dorsal spots, which usually number 23–30, may grow together, while the side spots may break apart. The head has a pair of distinct dark patches, one on each temple, together with a pinkish, salmon, or brownish V or X marking that forms an apex towards the snout. Behind the eye is a dark streak, outlined in white, pink, or buff. The venter is white, whitish, yellowish, or pinkish, often with an irregular scattering of dark spots.|$|E

5|$|Most of the fins {{are fairly}} narrow; in adults the {{pectoral}} fins are broad and roughly triangular. The moderately tall first dorsal fin is placed about {{halfway between the}} pectoral and pelvic fins, and its trailing margin is nearly vertical near the apex. The second dorsal fin is about three-quarters {{as high as the}} first and larger than the anal fin. The caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a prominent ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe; in young sharks the lower caudal fin lobe is much less distinct. This species is gray above, with darker saddles and scattered black <b>spots</b> <b>that</b> fade with age; the underside is off-white.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} hunts by flying slowly, {{quartering}} {{the ground and}} hovering over <b>spots</b> <b>that</b> may conceal prey. It may also use branches, fence posts or other lookouts to scan its surroundings, {{and this is the}} main means of prey location in the oil palm plantations of Malaysia. The bird has long, broad wings, enabling it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly. Its legs and toes are long and slender which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it a wide spread of talons when attacking prey. Studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles (or their equivalent) per night, equivalent to about twenty-three percent of the bird's bodyweight. Excess food is often cached at roosting sites and can be used when food is scarce.|$|E
5|$|Two-color {{varieties}} {{always have}} a white base color with areas of the second color. Tan and white {{is the most common}} two-color variety, but there is a wide range of other colors including lemon, a very light tan; red, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black. Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with yellow eyes. Ticked or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different colored flecks (ticking), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick beagle, which has <b>spots</b> <b>that</b> appear to be a midnight-blue color, similar to the coloring of the Bluetick Coonhound. Some tricolor beagles also have ticking of various colors in their white areas.|$|E

5|$|In a bid {{to impress}} Martin and his colleagues, Rhys {{purchases}} a barbecue and invites them over for dinner. He is granted {{an interview with the}} surgical board to join their training program at the hospital. Following a night out with Dane Canning (Luke Pegler), Rhys gets a hangover and is horrified to learn his interview has been moved to an earlier time. Rhys struggles to answer the panel's questions and he is not invited to join the program. He later visits his mother, Elaine, at her hospice, where he tells her he has joined the program. Rhys treats Chris Pappas (James Mason) after he is attacked, but fails to get him to stay for his X-rays. Aidan Foster (Bobby Morley) <b>spots</b> <b>that</b> Chris has a broken rib, which is pressing on his lung and Rhys finds him collapsed on the floor of Fitzgerald Motors. Rhys performs an emergency decompression on his lung and saves his life. Rhys asks senior surgeon Jessica Girdwood (Glenda Linscott) to reconsider letting him join the surgical program, but she declines. Rhys tries unsuccessfully to get Robbie O'Brien to quit the program and he turns his attentions to Erin Salisbury. He pretends to be romantically interested in her and tries to distract her from her studies.|$|E
5|$|The clutch is {{a single}} egg, usually pure white, {{sometimes}} with some reddish brown <b>spots</b> <b>that</b> soon disappear. The average size of the egg is , and it weighs , of which 6% is shell. If an egg is lost early enough, on rare occasions a replacement may be laid. This is very unusual for tubenoses. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 38–50days, the longer periods arising when the eggs have become chilled through adult absence. One adult typically spends three {{days at a time}} on the egg while its partner feeds at sea. The chicks are altricial and covered with silver-grey down, and are fed by both parents with their regurgitated oily stomach contents. The adults do not normally stay with the chick after first week, visiting only to bring food. After about 50days, the chicks are fed less regularly, sometimes with gaps of several days, and the parents may stop visiting completely shortly before the chick leaves the nest. The chicks fledge about 56–86days after hatching, and receive no parental support after leaving the nest hole.|$|E

Finding a tall hotel, the protagonist climbs {{to the roof}} and {{recruits}} Eric to film a trick video atop it. The police arrive to arrest them for trespassing, but the protagonist uses the opportunity to perform a McTwist over the helicopter and onto the awning of an adjacent hotel, allowing them and an awestruck Eric to evade the police. The team then travels to Vancouver, British Columbia. After doing errands for locals and finishing their {{part of the team}} video, the protagonist attends the video premiere at the Slam City Jam. However, Eric steals the idea and edits the protagonist's part out of the video, allowing only Eric to become a professional. After angrily confronting Eric, the protagonist enters Eric's pro contest and wins, becoming a pro as well.|$|E

5|$|The two dorsal fins {{are roughly}} equal {{in size and}} placed far back on the body: the first {{originates}} behind {{the midpoint of the}} pelvic fin bases and the second behind the midpoint of the anal fin base. The pectoral fins are large, while the pelvic fins are small and low, with angular margins. The anal fin is much larger than either dorsal fin; its base measures 13–18% of the total length and greatly exceeds the distance between the pelvic and anal fins, or between the dorsal fins. The caudal peduncle is laterally compressed, {{with the end of the}} anal fin very close to the caudal fin. The caudal fin comprises around a quarter of the total length; the upper lobe is low with a ventral notch near the tip, while the lower lobe is indistinct. The skin is very thick and covered by well-calcified dermal denticles. There is a prominent row of enlarged denticles, resembling saw teeth, along the upper edge of the caudal fin. The body is grayish-brown above, with 15–18 dark, rounded saddles, blotches, and/or <b>spots</b> <b>that</b> run onto the tail; each marking is highlighted by a paler border. The underside is white, as are the tips of the dorsal and caudal fins. The inside of the mouth is black.|$|E
