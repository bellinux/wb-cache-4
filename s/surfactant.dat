30|$|Zwitterionic <b>surfactants</b> are {{interesting}} in several respects. Depending {{on the nature}} of the polar groups, the zwitterionic <b>surfactants</b> often display excellent interfacial activity, and are known to be less irritating to human’s skin than many ionic <b>surfactants.</b> Also, changes in temperature, pH, and added electrolyte have minimal effects on zwitterionic <b>surfactants.</b> Compared with conventional anionic, cationic and nonionic <b>surfactants,</b> zwitterionic <b>surfactants</b> have better temperature resistance and salt tolerance. Hence, many researches on zwitterionic <b>surfactants</b> for oil extraction field have been reported in recent years (Harrison et al. 1998; Danov et al. 2004; El-Aila 2005). The betaine zwitterionic <b>surfactants</b> have usually acted as complementary <b>surfactants</b> in chemical flooding. Very few SP trials have been carried out using solely betaine and hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM). It is mainly due to the great adsorption loss of betaine <b>surfactants</b> in the formation which presents a major challenge for their applications in chemical flooding.|$|R

50|$|Cationic head {{groups have}} a {{positive}} charge and cationic <b>surfactants</b> are used in several different applications. One common use for cationic <b>surfactants</b> is in fabric softeners. Cationic head groups are also added to laundry detergent in conjunction with anionic <b>surfactants</b> because they help to improve the dirt removal properties of the anionic <b>surfactants.</b> Cationic head groups also increase the disinfecting properties of household cleaners. Some common cationic <b>surfactants</b> head groups include amines and quaternary ammonium ions. Among the many types of <b>surfactants,</b> cationic <b>surfactants</b> are very useful corrosion inhibitors due of their protective effectiveness in neutral and acidic media.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) {{parameters}} of <b>surfactants</b> {{have a significant}} effect on properties of <b>surfactants</b> and determine the effects of <b>surfactants.</b> The magneto-rheological fluid (MRF) is prepared by using the two typical HLB {{parameters of}} <b>surfactants</b> including Polyethylene Glycol and oleic acid in order to improve the property of MRF. Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) whose HLB parameter is 20 has strong hydrophilic. Oleic acid whose HLB parameter is 1 has strong lipophilic. The results indicate that magnetic properties of magnetic particles and rheological properties of MRF can hardly be changed by adding <b>surfactants.</b> The sedimentary stability of MRF adding lipophilic <b>surfactants</b> is superior to that of MRF adding hydrophilic <b>surfactants,</b> and the stability of MRF adding two <b>surfactants</b> increases significantly...|$|R

30|$|<b>Surfactants</b> enhance organic {{contaminant}} act by two mechanisms. First, <b>surfactants</b> reduce the interfacial tension between water and contaminants that slow {{the mobility of}} the organic components, thereby, <b>surfactants</b> can be able to transfer the hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) to the mobile phase [1]. Secondly, <b>surfactants</b> are capable of forming aggregates known as micelles, thus solubilizing HOCs. Numerous {{studies have indicated that}} <b>surfactants</b> can enhance recoveries of non-aqueous phase liquids [6, 17].|$|R
5|$|Fluorosurfactants {{are small}} organofluorine {{molecules}} used for repelling water and stains. Although expensive (comparable to pharmaceuticals at $200–2000 per kilogram), they yielded over $1 {{billion in annual}} revenues by 2006; Scotchgard alone generated over $300 million in 2000. Fluorosurfactants are a minority in the overall <b>surfactant</b> market, most of which is taken up by much cheaper hydrocarbon-based products.

40|$|Cationic <b>surfactants,</b> such as {{benzalkonium}} chloride and benzethonium chloride, possess quaternary ammonium salt. These <b>surfactants</b> have antimicrobial action {{and are used}} as a preservative and an antiseptic. The positively charged polar head of cationic <b>surfactants</b> seems {{to play a role}} in the antimicrobial action of these compounds. Recently, {{benzalkonium chloride}} in eye drops has been reported to induce apoptosis in conjunctival cells. Here, we examined whether various types of <b>surfactants</b> including anionic and amphoteric <b>surfactants</b> induce apoptosis or not in mammalian cells. Antimicrobial cationic <b>surfactants</b> induced apoptosis at lower concentration than its critical micelle concentration (CMC) in rat thymocytes. Other quaternary ammonium <b>surfactants,</b> such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, similarly increased biochemical and morphological features of apoptosis, whereas both anionic and amphoteric <b>surfactants</b> had no significant effect on these apoptotic features. These results suggest that the positive charge of quaternary ammonium <b>surfactants</b> is involved with onset of the apoptotic process. The treatment of benzethonium chloride also led to apoptotic cell death in Jurkat cells.

5000|$|The cost of <b>surfactants</b> is {{partially}} {{dependent on the}} crude oil market. As a stock ingredient for production of <b>surfactants,</b> paints highly dependent on <b>surfactants</b> {{will be affected by}} this market. [...] More intricate <b>surfactants</b> with larger, more difficult to synthesize structure are more expensive to produce and have a greater effect on end market price of their applications. As a result, simple, easy to produce and more environmentally friendly <b>surfactants</b> are used more widely.|$|R
30|$|<b>Surfactants</b> are {{chemicals}} {{with a high}} {{production volume}} and a wide dispersive use, i.e. <b>surfactants</b> have a high environmental impact. Most commercial <b>surfactants</b> are aerobically biodegradable. Only {{a small fraction of}} the <b>surfactants</b> is not aerobically broken down during the usual hydraulic retention times of modern WWTPs. This fraction, due to the predominantly hydrophobic nature of <b>surfactants,</b> adheres to the sludge. The sludge is usually collected and further treated under anaerobic conditions in digester tanks. Therefore, the knowledge about anaerobic biodegradability under digester tank conditions is important to gain an understanding about the environmental fate of <b>surfactants.</b>|$|R

25|$|Fetal lung {{maturity}} {{is associated}} with how much <b>surfactant</b> the fetus is producing.

25|$|Cleaning of oil {{contaminated}} sediments with self collapsing air microbubbles {{have been}} recently explored as a chemical free technology.

50|$|<b>Surfactants</b> {{affect a}} wide array of {{physical}} properties in paints. <b>Surfactants</b> affect the behavior of a paint not only during the lifetime of the formed coating but also the initial aggregation and film formation of the paint. <b>Surfactants</b> are also used to stabilize the dispersion of polymer particles during emulsion polymerization in paints and other applications. The mechanical stability, freeze-thaw stability and shelf-life of paints are all improved by the addition of <b>surfactants.</b> The addition of <b>surfactants</b> to paint also allow the paint to coat a surface more easily because <b>surfactants</b> increase the wetting of a solution.|$|R
50|$|Two {{formulations}} of different dispersing agents for oil spills, Dispersit and Omni-Clean, are shown below. A key {{difference between the}} two is that Omni-Clean uses ionic <b>surfactants</b> and Dispersit uses entirely non-ionic <b>surfactants.</b> Omni-Clean was formulated for little or no toxicity toward the environment. Dispersit, however, was designed as a competitor with Corexit. Dispersit contains non-ionic <b>surfactants,</b> which permit both primarily oil-soluble and primarily water-soluble <b>surfactants.</b> The partitioning of <b>surfactants</b> between the phases allows for effective dispersion.|$|R

25|$|<b>Surfactant</b> immune {{function}} is primarily attributed to two proteins: SP-A and SP-D. These proteins {{can bind to}} sugars {{on the surface of}} pathogens and thereby opsonize them for uptake by phagocytes. It also regulates inflammatory responses and interacts with the adaptive immune response. <b>Surfactant</b> degradation or inactivation may contribute to enhanced susceptibility to lung inflammation and infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{micelles}} {{was introduced to}} describe the core-corona aggregates of small <b>surfactant</b> molecules, however it has also extended to describe aggregates of amphiphilic block copolymers in selective solvents. It {{is important to know}} the difference between these two systems. The major difference between these two types of aggregates is in the size of their building blocks. <b>Surfactant</b> molecules have a molecular weight which is generally of a few hundreds of grams per mole while block copolymers are generally one or two orders of magnitude larger. Moreover, thanks to the larger hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts, block copolymers can have a much more pronounced amphiphilic nature when compared to <b>surfactant</b> molecules.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{amphiphilic}} {{block copolymer}} micelles display a similar behavior as <b>surfactant</b> micelles. These are generally called dynamic micelles and {{are characterized by}} the same relaxation processes assigned to <b>surfactant</b> exchange and micelle scission/recombination. Although the relaxation processes are the same between {{the two types of}} micelles, the kinetics of unimer exchange are very different. While in <b>surfactant</b> systems the unimers leave and join the micelles through a diffusion-controlled process, for copolymers the entry rate constant is slower than a diffusion controlled process. The rate of this process was found to be a decreasing power-law of the degree of polymerization of the hydrophobic block to the power 2/3. This difference is due to the coiling of the hydrophobic block of a copolymer exiting the core of a micelle.|$|E
40|$|<b>Surfactants</b> {{are widely}} used in {{household}} and industrial products. After use, <b>surfactants</b> {{as well as their}} products are mainly discharged into sewage treatment plants and then dispersed into the environment through effluent discharge into surface waters and sludge disposal on lands. <b>Surfactants</b> have different behavior and fate in the environment. Nonionic and cationic <b>surfactants</b> had much higher sorption on soil and sediment than anionic <b>surfactants</b> such as LAS. Most <b>surfactants</b> can be degraded by microbes in the environment although some <b>surfactants</b> such as LAS and DTDMAC as well as alkylphenols may be persistent under anaerobic conditions. LAS were found to degrade in sludge amended soils with a half-lives of 7 to 33 days. Most <b>surfactants</b> are not acutely toxic to organisms at environmental concentrations and aquatic chronic toxicity of <b>surfactants</b> occurred at concentrations usually greater than 0. 1 mg/L.
