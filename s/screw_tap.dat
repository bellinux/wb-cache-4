40|$|Abstract. How {{to apply}} a torque is a very {{important}} problem in finite element analysis, and the traditional method utilizes a series of forces instead of the torque, but often leads in stress concentration. In this paper, many methods are being used to achieve the torque. And these methods are being compared, thus we can get several availability methods. Introduction The problem of torque exists in almost every engineering field, such as structural, aerospace and so on. And how to apply torque load accurately is always a matter in finite element analysis. Many structures such as <b>screw</b> <b>tap,</b> polish rod of machine tool, mixer shaft, drive shaft of automobile etc [...] . In order to get precise results of structural subjected to external load, including stress, strain, displacement and other mechanical variables, the modern design method such as finite element method has been employed to solve the problem. According to the engineering experiences, some of traits for instance the keyway of shaft, flat of thread must be considered. So how to apply torque on a section of solid model has become a problem. In general, different methods always lead to the same result. But because of stress concentration and other reasons, different methods lead to different stiff matrixes, even bring about stress singularity; ultimately affect the result’s estimation.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{tool life}} extension methods applied to cut-off tools made of high-speed steel.

5000|$|A {{self-tapping}} screw is a <b>screw</b> that can <b>tap</b> its own hole {{as it is}} driven into the material. For hard [...] such as metal or hard plastics, the self-tapping ability is often created by cutting {{a gap in the}} continuity of the thread on the screw, generating a [...] and cutting edge similar to those on a tap. Thus, whereas a regular machine <b>screw</b> cannot <b>tap</b> its own hole in a metal substrate, a self-tapping one can (within reasonable limits of substrate hardness and depth). For softer substrates such as wood or soft plastics, the self-tapping ability can come simply from a tip that tapers to a gimlet point (in which no flute is needed). Like the tip of a nail or gimlet, such a point forms the hole by displacement of the surrounding material rather than any chip-forming drilling/cutting/evacuating action.|$|R
