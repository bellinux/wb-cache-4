40|$|Recovery from {{gambling}} addiction, {{for those}} who received treatment, may be better understood in a follow up assessment. This study examines which of the factors (individual and environmental) {{may be associated with}} <b>sustaining</b> <b>recovery</b> after completion of treatment. Using data collected for the Iowa Gambling Treatment Outcomes Report: 2014, there were 755 clients discharged from May 2012 to March 2015. Of these, 307 clients consented {{to be part of the}} 6 month post discharge follow-up study, and 141 participated in the follow-up assessment. The demographic characteristics, discharge status (complete or incomplete treatment), and length of service for the 141 that completed the 6 month post-discharge assessment did not vary significantly between those who were admitted into services during the study period. Past 30 day and Past 12 month DSM- 5 diagnostic criteria for Disordered Gambling were gathered at Admission, Discharge, and 6 month post-discharge. Logistic regression was used to determine factors related to gambling disorder status (1 = “Disordered gambler”, and 0 = “No disordered gambler”). The independent variables measured were clients’ demographic characteristics, substance use, length of service (LOS), participation in Recovery Support Services (RSS), and participation in e-Therapy. In the final model, females were 2. 8 times more likely to be diagnosed as disordered gamblers 6 months after discharge than males. Those who received one or more RSS were 70 % less likely to meet the criteria for a gambling disorder 6 months after discharge.

Rather, harsh crime control policies and draconian drug laws, in particular, account for the apparently large numbers of PSMI who are arrested and incarcerated. Recommendations are offered for service providers to focus on the ameliora-tion of criminogenic factors, not simply on treating mental illness among PSMI in the criminal justice system.

40|$|Objective: It is {{critical}} to identify modifiable factors associated with functional recovery from hip fracture. The authors examined the association between pain intensity and two functional endpoints—instrumental {{activities of daily living}} and social activity participation—after hip fracture. Method: A total of 270 cognitively intact, community-dwelling persons older than 65 who underwent surgical hip frac-ture repair in New Haven, Connecticut, were followed for 12 months. Results: Pain intensity was strongly negatively associated with both instrumental and social func-tioning (p values <. 001). Increases in pain intensity between 6 and 12 months were also associated with concurrent decreases in function (p values <. 001). These rela-tionships were partly explained by depressive symptoms and a marker of physical ability—gait speed. Discussion: Interventions to control pain may enhance func-tional status after hip fracture; however, pain relief must be maintained to <b>sustain</b> <b>recovery.</b> Attention to the complex relationships among pain, depressive symptoms, and physical impairments should inform intervention development...|$|R
50|$|For those {{unfamiliar}} with the traditional lay-out of mountain villages in the Vosges Mountains, the pattern of settlement in this commune may appear curiously dispersed: roads are underdeveloped and the uneven topography enforces a patchy and dispersed footprint for the hamlets. In fact developments {{in the twentieth century}} have in some ways contributed to the spreading of the settlement pattern. In common with many rural communes, Pair-et-Grandrupt suffered a prolonged population decline which set in after the agricultural depression which started in the 1870s and from which there was no <b>sustained</b> <b>recovery</b> until {{the second half of the}} twentieth century. In this commune, however, the trend reversed as the motor transport revolution improved general access to rural communes: population has risen strongly since 1972. Between 1968 and 1999 registered population (excluding double counting in respect of students and others with two registered homes) increased from 200 to 439, and the construction of a modern water supply network supported by appropriate pipes and pumps has made it possible to build on formerly dry mountainside sites, and at levels of housing density which in earlier centuries was not possible simply because the nearest usable water supply was insufficient and/or too far away.|$|E

Once normal campus operations resume a cost and damage analysis is to be completed by the finical office committee. Many University also mandate a plan reassessment, usually conducted through the use of surveys, this reassessment is used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the response. Another critical part of the recovery process is to reestablish the University's computer and information systems, these system are critical to the overall operations and functions of the institution, the plan require cooperation from all departments campus wide. The Louisiana Delta Community College among with many other schools base its technology recovery plans off of the Baylor University Center for Computing and Information Systems Disaster Recovery Plan; this plan breaks down into a two step process depending on the severity of the situation. Step one entails a partial recovery of university data including recovery of as many files and folders as possible, email accounts, data sources, and website contents. The partial recovery helps jump start normal university operations but many tasks are still not possible. Step two describes a full system recovery, that is only possible if little damage was substantiated to the universities servers. The Louisiana Delta Community College will try to recover the entire student database, staff email, network file storage, and website content. Each step in the recovery process is essential to bring the University to back to normal functions and operations.|$|E
40|$|Background: It is {{important}} for doctors and patients to know what factors help recovery from depression. Our objectives were to predict the probability of <b>sustained</b> <b>recovery</b> for patients presenting with mild to moderate depression in primary care, and to devise a means of estimating this probability on an individual basis. Methods: Participants in a randomised controlled trial were identified through general practitioners (GPs) around three academic centres in England. Participants were aged 18 +, with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores 12 to 19 inclusive, {{and at least one}} physical symptom on the Bradford Somatic Inventory (BSI). Baseline assessments included demographics, treatment preference, life events and difficulties, and health and social care use. The outcome was <b>sustained</b> <b>recovery,</b> defined as HDRS score < 8 at both 12 and 26 week follow-up. We produced a predictive model of outcome using logistic regression clustered by GP, and created a probability tree to demonstrate estimated probability of recovery at the individual level. Results: Of 220 participants, 74 % provided HDRS scores at 12 and 26 weeks. Thirty nine (24 %) achieved <b>sustained</b> <b>recovery,</b> associated with being female, married/cohabiting, having a low BSI score and receiving preferred treatment. A linear predictor gives individual probabilities for <b>sustained</b> <b>recovery</b> given specific characteristics, and probability trees illustrate the range of probabilities and their uncertainties for some important combinations of factors. Conclusions: <b>Sustained</b> <b>recovery</b> from mild to moderate depression in primary care appears more likely for women, people who are married or cohabiting, have few somatic symptoms and receive their preferred treatment. <br/...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{an attempt}} {{is made to}} {{identify}} some key challenges for infrastructure sectors in post-conflict reconstruction. In spite of the Hague and Geneva Conventions, infrastructure can be damaged in conflicts, and reconstructing infrastructure is often essential to <b>sustain</b> <b>recovery.</b> Conflicts erode governance institutions, weaken public expenditure management systems, and increase transaction costs {{making it difficult for}} principals to monitor their agents. Infrastructure includes both ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ assets of societies and the rebuilding of social institutions and capacity of communities is as crucial as reconstructing roads and bridges. A framework is developed here for assessing alternative infrastructure policies for their impact on three key dimensions of (i) governance and state rebuilding, (ii) conflict prevention and peace, and (iii) poverty reduction. Drawing upon evidence from evaluation studies including Afghanistan, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, East Timor and Rwanda, a number of policy tensions and action points for policymaking in infrastructure sectors in post-conflict contexts are identified.
