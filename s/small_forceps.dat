That door was also bolted, as I had stated. However, he went to the length of unbolting it, and opening and shutting it several times; this he did with the utmost precaution against making any noise. Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed to rivet his attention. He examined it carefully, and then, nimbly whipping out a pair of <b>small</b> <b>forceps</b> from his case, he drew out some minute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND The goal of {{the current}} study was to assess the usefulness, {{reliability}} and safety of the imageguided stereotactic biopsy of intra-axial brain tumours. METHODS The study was conducted within a time frame of one year. 20 patients – 14 males and 6 females (median age 63. 5 years) were included. Computerized tomography (CT) – guidedstereotactic biopsies were performed by a single stereotactic neurosurgeon. A modifiedRiechert Stereotactic System (MHT Medical High Tech) and a workstation for multiplanartrajectory planning (Amira) were used. Biopsies were done with <b>small</b> <b>forceps</b> and 10 – 15 samples were collected for histological analysis. During the operations also touch imprints and crush smears of the specimens were examined by the cytopathologist. Correct place ofthe biopsy and any detectable bleeding were analyzed by post-op CT scan. Descriptivestatistic methods were used and results were compared with the data from the literature. RESULTS Overall treatment morbidity was limited to one patient (5 %), there was no mortality. A conclusive tissue diagnosis could be achieved in 19 out of 20 patients (95 %). There were 3 glioblastomas, 3 anaplastic astrocitomas, 5 astrocitomas, 1 inflammation, 2 lymphomas,and 2 malignant tumours – not further classified and 3 metastasis. All patients had postbiopsy CT scan to check for haemorrhage (none occurred). CONCLUSIONS MHT Stereotactic system and Amira multiplanar image guided trajectory planningsoftware are reliable tools enabling trained stereotactic neurosurgeon to obtain tissuediagnosis in almost every case with very little morbidit...|$|E
40|$|Citation: White, Clarence H. The tensile {{strength}} of wool. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1905. Introduction: It is my purpose {{in this experiment}} to attempt to demonstrate the {{tensile strength}} of single wool fibers from four of the chief breeds, viz. Cotswold, Shropshire, Southdown, and the Rambouillet. Samples {{from different parts of}} the body were also compared. The apparatus used consisted of two jolly balances, a compound microscope with ocular or eye piece, micrometer, <b>small</b> <b>forceps,</b> mechanical stage, and other microscopic equipment. Two jolly balances were used because of the wide variation between the Cotswold and Rambouillet wools, the Cotswold fibers being so strong that a special balance with an extra strong spring or coil was required. The test was begun by first determining the constant of each balance, which was done by making the zero reading and then noting the displacement caused by a weight of one gram. Next a wool fiber was fastened on the hook of the balance by knotting one and half-hitching. The tensile strength was then easily read in grams by simply pulling down on the fiber until it broke, the reading being made just at the moment the fiber parted. No particular length of fiber was used as the weight of a single fiber is so very slight that it was concluded the results would not be influenced. The only opportunity for a variation might be based on the cry that in a greater length the chances for weak points are greater. No objection can be raised on account of this theory, however, because a thread is no stronger than its weakest point. This last statement might also be sited as a reason for testing many fibers and each but one. In connection with obtaining the strength of each fiber the diameter was also taken as {{it was found that the}} strength varied directly with the diameter. For the purpose of measuring the diameters, the fibers were fastened on a glass slide by means of balsam and cover slips. In this condition the fibers were held firm and straight, so that with the aid of a micrometer–microscope and mechanical stage the diameter was very easily determined...|$|E
30|$|It was {{difficult}} to examine this woman vaginally; therefore an urgent diagnostic hysteroscopy with D&C was organised. She was examined under general anaesthesia. No abnormalities were noted on her vulva. The hymen was intact and complete. With a very small (virgin) speculum, the cervix was visualised. The cervix was small with healthy appearance; no bleeding or signs of atrophic cervicitis were seen. Using a <b>small</b> grasp <b>forceps</b> the uterine sound (hysterometre) was passed through with great difficulty. Brown discharges and old dark blood came from the cervix. Haematometra was suspected. The uterus was bulky; no adnexal or other mass were palpated.|$|R

Safe grasping of an SMM with forceps and its complete resection under transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS) guidance is not always easy. SMMs are slippery, making them difficult to grasp. The SMM moves right to left and anterior to posterior when the surgeon tries to grasp it with placental forceps. Surgeons could use <b>small</b> Martin <b>forceps</b> (65 % <b>smaller)</b> to grasp SMMs safely and tightly under direct TCR (transcervical resectoscope) observation.

40|$|The {{influence}} of endoscopic forceps variables (size, design, and make) on biopsy specimen weight, depth, and diagnostic adequacy {{has been studied}} in vitro on normal human stomach, and in vivo at endoscopy in dog and in patients. Greater pressure during the biopsy procedure yielded significantly heavier, deeper, and histologically more acceptable specimens. Standard sized forceps (diameter 2. 4 mm) and those with ellipsoid cups consistently produced larger specimens than the <b>smaller</b> 'paediatric' <b>forceps</b> (1. 8 mm) and those with round cups. Deeper specimens were also obtained using the standard forceps. In vitro and in vivo in the dog, the standard sized forceps also produced specimens of greater diagnostic adequacy than the paediatric forceps.

50|$|Labidura riparia is {{a species}} of earwig in the family Labiduridae, {{formerly}} Forficula riparia , characterized by their modified cerci as forceps, and light tan color. They are more {{commonly known as the}} striped earwig, due to two dark longitudinal stripes {{down the length of the}} pronotum. They are sometimes wrongly referred to as Labidura japonica, although said species is actually a subspecies, Labidura riparia japonica, found only in Japan. L. riparia are a cosmopolitan species primarily in tropical to subtropical regions. Body size varies greatly, ranging from 16 mm to 30 mm, with 10 abdominal segments. Males and females differ in forcep size, with males having much larger and stronger curve, while females have <b>smaller,</b> straighter <b>forceps</b> with a slight curve at the end. Earwigs use these forceps to assist in predation, defense, sexual selection, courting and mating, and wing folding.|$|R
30|$|Following the {{diagnostic}} hysteroscopy, women {{who agreed to}} participate in the preference study had their choice of treatment arranged. Those who chose office polypectomy underwent the procedure immediately following diagnosis in most instances, although some participants had their treatment scheduled within the following 8  weeks. Office polypectomies were performed in the office hysteroscopy clinic and inpatient procedures were performed in operating theatres, under general or regional anaesthesia. Office polyp removal was carried out under direct hysteroscopic vision using miniature mechanical (scissors, biopsy cups and grasping forceps) or electrosurgical instruments (bipolar electrodes), with or without the need for minor degrees of cervical dilatation and local anaesthesia (direct cervical infiltration or paracervical injection). Blind avulsion with <b>small</b> polypectomy <b>forceps</b> was also allowed. Women who chose inpatient polypectomy could have traditional dilatation and curettage or removal under vision using a resectoscope. Clinicians were free to choose the operative technique for polypectomy. Endometrial biopsy and medical therapies were permitted when indicated.|$|R
40|$|Peripheral nerve {{injuries}} with a {{poor prognosis}} are common. Evening primrose oil (EPO) has beneficial biological effects and immunomodulatory properties. Since electrical activity {{plays a major}} role in neural regeneration, the present study investigated the effects of electrical stimulation (ES), combined with evening primrose oil (EPO), on sciatic nerve function after a crush injury in rats. In anesthetized rats, the sciatic nerve was crushed using <b>small</b> haemostatic <b>forceps</b> followed by ES and/or EPO treatment for 4 weeks. Functional recovery of the sciatic nerve was assessed using the sciatic functional index. Histopathological changes of gastrocnemius muscle atrophy were investigated by light microscopy. Electrophysiological changes were assessed by the nerve conduction velocity of sciatic nerves. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine the remyelination of the sciatic nerve following the interventions. EPO + ES, EPO, and ES obviously improved sciatic nerve function assessed by the sciatic functional index and nerve conduction velocity of the sciatic nerve at 28 days after operation. Expression of the peripheral nerve remyelination marker, protein zero (P 0), was increased in the treatment groups at 28 days after operation. Muscle atrophy severity was decreased significantly while the nerve conduction velocity was increased significantly in rats with sciatic nerve injury in the injury + EPO + ES group than in the EPO or ES group. Totally speaking, the combined use of EPO and ES may produce an improving effect on the function of sciatic nerves injured by a crush. The increased expression of P 0 may have contributed to improving the functional effects of combination therapy with EPO and ES as well as the electrophysiological and histopathological features of the injured peripheral nerve...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Studies on airway {{remodeling}} {{in children}} with cystic fibrosis (CF) may be hampered by difficulty in obtaining evaluable endobronchial biopsy specimens because of large amounts of mucus and inflammation in the CF airway. We prospectively assessed how the quality of biopsy specimens obtained from children with CF compare with those from children with other airway diseases. METHODS: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy was performed in 67 CF children (age range, 0. 2 to 16. 8 years), 34 children with wheeze/asthma (W/A), and 64 control children with chronic respiratory symptoms. Up to three biopsy specimens were taken and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Biopsy specimen size and structural composition were quantified using stereology. RESULTS: At least one evaluable biopsy specimen was obtained in 72 % of CF children, in 79 % of children with W/A, and in 72 % of control subjects (difference was not significant). The use of large biopsy forceps (2. 0 mm) rather than <b>small</b> biopsy <b>forceps</b> (1. 0 mm) [odds ratio (OR), 5. 8; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 1 to 29. 8; p = 0. 037] {{and the number of}} biopsy specimens taken (odds ratio, 2. 6; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 3 to 5. 2; p = 0. 006) significantly contributed to the success rate. Biopsy size and composition were similar between groups, except that CF children and those patients with W/A had a higher percentage of the biopsy specimen composed of muscle than did control subjects (median 6. 2 % and 9. 7 % vs 0. 9 %, respectively; p = 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: Biopsy size and quality are adequate for the study of airway remodeling in CF children as young as 2 months of age. Researchers should use large forceps when possible and take at least two biopsy specimens per patient. An increased airway smooth muscle content of the airway mucosa may contribute to the pathophysiology of CF lung disease...|$|R
40|$|Whole {{blood was}} {{withdrawn}} by tail vessel puncture from anesthetized adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and 0. 1 ml was re-injected subcutaneously {{at each of}} two sites on their abdominal wall. In addition, two adjacent sites were injected with 0. 1 ml of sterile saline, and two more sites were only punctured using an injecting needle. In {{the second part of}} the study anesthetized adult male Sprague-Dawley rats had two sites on the abdominal wall pinched using a <b>small</b> pair of <b>forceps,</b> two adjacent sites received an injection of 0. 1 ml of whole blood obtained by tail vessel puncture, and two more sites were both pinched and injected with 0. 1 ml of whole blood. At intervals of 3, 6, 12 h, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days the animals were euthanized and the skin of the abdomen was processed for histological assessment. Hemosiderin staining in tissues from the first part of the study was assessed qualitatively by scoring sections as 0, 1, 2, or 3 (representing no staining, mild staining, moderate staining, and intense staining) and semi quantitatively using a Nanozoomer Digital Pathology Scanner (NDP Scan U 10074 - 01, Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., Japan). No inflammatory reaction was observed at the sites subjected to needle puncture only. At the sites of saline injection a mild reaction occurred. At the sites where the blood had been injected an intense inflammatory cell response occurred centrally, but not toward the periphery where blood had tracked. In the second experiment the most intense inflammation was also observed in the sites where there had been a pinch and injection of blood. Again, this was maximal centrally with reduced inflammation peripherally. Perls' staining of hemosiderin was comparable in both models, with iron first observed at day 1 at the region of the injection site. At the sites of injection only, and the sites of injection plus pinch, blood had spread laterally. Hemosiderin staining appeared first and more intensely at the site of injection/trauma. The intensity of the inflammatory response in this animal model of bruising was, therefore, directly related to the proximity to the site of trauma; the appearance and intensity of hemosiderin staining was also influenced by the location within the bruises. This study has shown that histological changes that may be utilized to date bruises may be significantly influenced by the site of the biopsy. Claire Ross, Roger W. Byard, Neil E. I. Langloi...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Ureteroscopy has {{improved}} {{from the first}} use of ureteroscope in the 1970 's. Although the success rate increased in the last years, (1) new treatment techniques are being developed for impacted and large proximal ureter stones (2). Pneumatic lithotripsy has high efficiency with low complication rates (2). However, in case of steinstrasse and large (> 1 cm) ureter stones, fragmented small stones may obstruct insertion of a ureteroscope after initial lithotripsy. In order to triumph over this issue, multiple ureteroscopic passages and manipulations needed for extraction of these <b>small</b> stones by <b>forceps</b> or basket catheters. The overall incidence of stricture was found upto 14. 2 % when the fragments were removed with a grasping forceps or a basket (3). We present our technique to disperse small fragmented stones in order to contact non-fragmented rest stone. Materials and Methods Ureteral lithotripsy was performed with an 8 - 9. 8 F semirigid ureteroscope using a pneumatic lithotripter (Swiss LithoClast, EMS, Nyon, Switzerland). The stone was fragmented into small pieces as small as 2 - 3 mm. by pneumatic lithotripter. Eventually, these fragmented stones interfered with vision and the lithotripter {{to get in touch}} with the rest stone. After fragmenting distal part of the large stone, the ureteroscope was pulled back out of ureter. While pulling back, the operating channel was closed and irrigation fluid was flowing in order not to decrease pressure behind the stones. Simultaneously, a person tilted the operating table to about 30 &# 176; in reverse Trendelenburg position. When the ureteroscope was out of ureteral orifice, the operating channel was opened and irrigation fluid was stopped. This maneuver aided decreasing pressure in the bladder more rapidly in addition to feeding tube. Stone dust and antegrade fluid flow were easily seen out of the ureteral orifice. Ureteroscope was re-inserted after 30 - 60 seconds. While reaching the rest of the stone, small stone dust was seen at first. Bigger stones were approximately 3 - 5 cm distal to the original place of the stone. When the non-fragmented rest stone appeared, there were no blocking fragmented stones. Insertion of the ureteroscope was easy and we could go on with the lithotripsy procedure. Conclusions In comparison to standard position, tilting and rapid decrease in pressure by pulling back the ureteroscope made gravity and negative pressure more effective...|$|R
