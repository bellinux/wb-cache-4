Prior to the attachment, irrigation with a chemical disinfectant is advised. The pins are driven through defined sheaths from the vestibular to the oral side of the jaw. Ligaments anatomy should be considered, and if necessary decompensation can be achieved with minimal surgical interventions. The proper fit of the template is crucial and should be maintained throughout the whole treatment. Regardless of the mucosal resilience, a correct and stable attachment is achieved through the bone fixation.The access to the jaw can now only be achieved through the sleeves embedded in {{the surgical}} template. Using specific burs through the sleeves the mucosa is removed. Every bur used, carries a sleeve compatible to the sleeves in the template, which ensures that the final position is achieved but no further progress in the alveolar ridge can take place. Further procedure {{is very similar to}} the traditional implant placement. The pilot hole is drilled and then expanded. With the aid of the splint, the implants are finally placed. After that, the splint can be removed.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{different}} bite registration methods for maxillomandibular relationship were examined using an electronic intraoral <b>support</b> <b>pin</b> system (IPR-Systems Dental Balance GmbH, Potsdam, Germany). Twenty fully denticulated subjects were screened for TMD (temporomandibular disorders) {{based on the}} Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC / TMD) and distinguished into functional impaired and functional healthy groups. All study participants were placed on a specialized chair which supported a standardised upright seating position. The position of the mandible was recorded in two-dimensional coordinates. The following methods of the maxillomandibular relationship were performed on all study participants: field of adduction 1 (without movement of the central-bearing-point system) field of adduction 2 (after dynamic sequences with the intraoral pin, 			neuromuscular deprogramming) centric relation guided manually: 		o by an experienced examiner 		o by a non experienced examiner The fields of adduction 1 / 2 {{were not significantly different}} (paired t-test as a group comparison test: transverse: p = 0. 369; sagittal: p = 0. 486). The fields of adduction were significantly anterior in comparison to the manually guided centric relation (paired t-test as a group comparison test: p < 0. 0001). Comparing the fields of adduction 1 / 2 with the manually guided centric relation {{it was found that the}} neuromuscular mandibular position above all tend to had a higher scatter, than the bite registration token by the two operators. There is no tendency of differences found between the two independent operators. Myopathy, occlusopathy and different levels of experience of the operators had no influence to the outcome of the applied methods of maxillomandibular relationship recording. In all methods of maxillomandibular relationship recording generally functional impaired patients tend to had higher scattering as the healthy subjects. In conclusion the patients` health and neuromuscular deprogramming seems to be a negative influence on scattering. The position of the mandible is determined by the method of maxillomandibular relationship. The fields of adduction were significantly more anterior in comparison to the manually guided centric relation. Based on the obtained results, the manually guided centric relation may be recommended for maxillomandibular relationship record with functional healthy and functional impaired patients...|$|E

40|$|Polarized {{growth and}} {{remodeling}} of the plasma membrane proteome {{in response to}} environmental changes in yeast depends on regulated exocytosis and endocytosis. The yeast chitin synthase III, Chs 3, shuttles between internal compartments and the plasma membrane to allow its cell cycle-dependent expression at the bud neck and uniform discharge at the cell surface upon heat stress. The exomer complex, comprised of Chs 5 and the ChAP family of cargo recognition subunits, mediates the direct, controlled export of Chs 3 from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the plasma membrane. To further establish the role of exomer in regulated trafficking, we characterized a novel exomer-dependent cargo, the prion-domain containing protein, Pin 2. The Pin 2 cytosolic domain encompasses an exomer-binding site, located within the C-terminal prion domain, and most likely another interaction site towards the N-terminal region. In parallel, we found that a vast portion of the ChAP Chs 6, required for Chs 3 export, confers Chs 3 specificity, suggesting a proportionally large binding surface on the cargo. Pin 2, like Chs 3, localizes to the plasma membrane in a polarized, cell cycle-dependent manner. Moreover Pin 2 and Chs 3 share several trafficking requirements. Apart from exomer-mediated export, Pin 2 and Chs 3 undergo active recycling through endocytosis and clathrin adaptor complex 1 (AP- 1) -mediated retrograde transport from early endosomes to the TGN. Recognition of AP- 1 and most likely of the AP- 2 endocytic adaptor could occur through a tyrosine rich YGENYYY sequence in Pin 2. The active shuttling of Pin 2 between the TGN, early endosomes and the plasma membrane {{is required for the}} polarized localization of Pin 2 and seems to allow its immediate, stress-responsive redistribution. Upon lithium treatment Pin 2 is rapidly endocytosed and maintained in internal compartments. Stress relief results in fast re-export of Pin 2 to the plasma membrane. The Pin 2 prion domain contains the exomer and potential AP- 1 /AP- 2 binding motifs. Therefore aggregation of this region may modify the interaction of Pin 2 with sorting machineries. Indeed, we found that polarized localization and maintenance of Pin 2 in internal compartments is compromised in a Pin 2 (QNtoED), prion domain mutant. Mutation of QN residues to charged amino acids in Pin 2 (QNtoED) inhibits the formation of SDS-resistant prion aggregates upon overexpression. Reversible posttranslational modifications contribute an additional level of Pin 2 trafficking regulation. Ubiquitylation of Pin 2 is required for its endocytosis under physiological conditions and seems to {{play a crucial role in}} Pin 2 internalization upon lithium stress. Modification within a cluster of four cytosolic cysteines by palmitoylation seems to <b>support</b> <b>Pin</b> 2 cell surface expression. Interestingly, the presence of two luminal cysteines, which engage in the formation of disulfide-linked pin structure, is crucial for Pin 2 export. Together this data demonstrates that several cytosolic motifs and the Pin 2 prion domain, as well as a defined luminal structure, determine the regulated trafficking of Pin 2. ...|$|E

DCCSS structures {{are commonly used}} in armored vehicle applications.

Static tests were performed with the varying of support conditions from simply <b>supported,</b> <b>pinned,</b> and torqued bolts. The goal was to understand the change in strength and failure modes due to the joint under transverse loading. Optimization of the joint was also involved, thus the torque levels were also varied to conclude t he best torque level for performance of the joint. It was found out that the bolted joint improved the performance and strength of the DCCSS in comparison to the simply <b>supported</b> and <b>pinned</b> <b>support</b> conditions. The failure mode of the DCCSS changed with each support condition, but ultimate failure was consistently due to delamination between the adhesive interlayer and face sheet. The optimal torque level of 90 ft-lbs. was determined from static testing. The influence of fatigue on stiffness retention, residual strength and damage were also conducted for both <b>pinned</b> and torqued <b>support</b> conditions to study durability.

40|$|Pick-and-place regrasp is an {{important}} manipulation skill for a robot. It helps a robot accomplish tasks that cannot be achieved within a single grasp, due to constraints such as kinematics or collisions between the robot and the environment. Previous work on pick-and-place regrasp only leveraged flat surfaces for intermediate placements, and thus is limited in the capability to reorient an object. In this paper, we extend the reorientation capability of a pick-and-place regrasp by adding a vertical pin on the working surface and using it as the intermediate location for regrasping. In particular, our method automatically computes the stable placements of an object leaning against a vertical pin, finds several force-closure grasps, generates a graph of regrasp actions, and searches for the regrasp sequence. To compare the regrasping performance with and without using pins, we evaluate the success rate {{and the length of}} regrasp sequences while performing tasks on various models.
