50|$|This is the {{calendar}} for Old Style 1752, a leap year which began on 1 January, and dropped 3-13 September to {{transition to the}} Gregorian calendar. Previously, the Old Style calendar in England (and related regions) had begun on 25 March and ended with the following March, on 24 March. Because the Gregorian calendar did not have leap day in 1700, the original 10-day difference in calendars had expanded to an 11-day difference, and to compensate, 2 September was followed by 14 September, as skipping 11 days beyond 3 September. Year 1753, in England (and related regions) followed the full Gregorian calendar. Note, below, the <b>shortened</b> <b>length</b> of September.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the flat body, another feature of the Gibson ES-350T is its <b>shortened</b> <b>length</b> of only 597 mm (23½ inch compared to Gibson's otherwise 25½ inch). It is thought that this short scale {{is due to the}} jazz guitarist Tal Farlow, who had expressed the desire to make difficult chords and melodies easier to grasp. Against this assumption, when Gibson honoured Tal Farlow with his own signature model in 1962, the Gibson Valley Farlow, - it had a standard scale of 648 mm. In addition, both the ES-350T and sister model Byrdland have particularly narrow spacing between the individual strings, which required the manufacture of special, narrow-built pickups for these models. The scale length was extended from 1977 to 1981 to 25.5 inches.|$|E

50|$|Both the <b>shortened</b> <b>length</b> of the N-C {{bond and}} the longer Se=C bond suggest a delocalization of the lone pair on the amines; the Se=C π-bonding {{electrons}} are drawn towards the Se atom, while the N-lone pair is drawn towards the carbonyl carbon. A similar effect is observed in oxo- and thiourea analogs. In going from urea to thiourea to selenourea the double bond is more delocalized and longer, while the C-N σ bond is stronger and shorter. In terms of resonance structures, the selenol form (structures II, III) is more prevalent compared to oxo- and thione analogs; however, the lone pair the nitrogen of selenourea delocalizes only slightly more than the lone pair on thiourea (in contrast to a much greater delocalization in going from urea to thiourea). These minor differences suggest that the properties emergent from the delocalized N-lone pair and destabilization C=S and C=Se π bond in thiourea and selenourea will also be similar.|$|E
5000|$|Broca's aphasia {{is a type}} of {{expressive}} aphasia because speech production is halting and effortful. Damage is typically in the anterior portion of the left hemisphere. Typically, writing is at least as severely impaired as speech.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{epidemiological}} {{studies have examined}} the association between <b>shortened</b> telomere <b>length</b> and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM), while the results remained conflicting. We conducted a meta-analysis to derive a more precise estimation of the relationship between them. METHODS: We systematically reviewed the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science for all studies on the association between telomere length and T 2 DM. We conducted this study assessed by STATA 11. 0. Data were summarized using random-effects or fixed-effects meta-analysis. The heterogeneity and publication bias among studies were examined by using χ(2) -based Q statistic test and Egger's test, respectively. RESULTS: Nine cohorts consisting of 5759 cases and 6518 controls were selected into the meta-analysis. The results indicated that <b>shortened</b> telomere <b>length</b> was significantly associated with T 2 DM risk (OR: 1. 291; 95 % CI: 1. 112, 1. 498; P< 0. 001) with heterogeneity (I(2)  =  71. 6 %). When three cohorts responsible for the heterogeneity were excluded, the pooled OR for the remaining cohorts indicated a significant association between <b>shortened</b> telomere <b>length</b> and T 2 DM (OR: 1. 117; 95 % CI: 1. 002, 1. 246; P =  0. 045) without heterogeneity.

40|$|A {{foreland}} fold-and-thrust belt {{has been}} growing west of the Hidaka Collision Zone (HCZ) since middle Miocene, associated with the collision between the Kuril and the Northeast Japanese island arcs (Fig. 1). The active front of the belt reaches the eastern margin of the Ishikari lowland 70 km west of the HCZ. As the collisional process has been recorded as {{the structure of the}} belt, it is essential for analyzing the process to restore the cross-section of the belt. JNOC (Japan National Oil Corporation) seismic profiles H 91 - 2 and H 91 - 3 across {{the western part of the}} belt (including the Ishikari lowland) are highly useful data for contributing to the restoration.
