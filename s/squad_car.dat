5|$|After {{stopping}} one of Fat Tony's operations, Homer practically rids Springfield of crime. However, Fat Tony escapes and vows to kill Homer {{unless he}} leaves town. Homer {{is unable to}} get protection from the citizens he protects (only Ned Flanders volunteers, but Homer ignores his offer) and Lenny and Carl lock themselves in a jail cell. When Homer does not leave, Fat Tony arrives {{with a few of}} his own henchmen (including Johnny Tightlips), as well as mafia muscle—the characters of the Sopranos series. Just before they are about to kill Homer, someone shoots the mobsters and injures them. Safe again, Homer resigns as police chief and offers the job to the first person who comes along, which is Wiggum (who notes that an identical situation is how he became chief in the first place). When Marge thanks him for saving Homer, Wiggum says that he did not shoot anyone, having lost his gun, badge and nearly his <b>squad</b> <b>car.</b> Unbeknownst to them, the person who saved Homer was Maggie, who fires at the mobsters from her window with a scoped sporting rifle.|$|E

25|$|Police alleged the group's {{plan was}} to hijack a Boeing 747 and {{threaten}} to kill one passenger every hour until Manson and fellow Family members were released from prison. When a police <b>squad</b> <b>car</b> arrived, Share opened fire on the vehicle, shattering the windshield. As more squad cars arrived, they blocked the van from fleeing the scene, spraying it with over 50 bullets; the Family members fired nearly 20 rounds at the officers. When police finally gained control of the scene and apprehended the group, Mary Brunner, Catherine Share, and Larry Bailey were injured.|$|E
500|$|The second team, officer Herb Frauenberger and his partner, Tony Palma, {{arrived a}} few minutes later. They found Lennon lying {{face down on the}} floor of the {{reception}} area, blood pouring from his mouth, and his clothing already soaked with blood, with Hastings attending to him. Realizing the extent of Lennon's injuries, the policemen decided not to wait for an ambulance, immediately carried him into their <b>squad</b> <b>car,</b> and rushed him to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.

50|$|In 2014, the Cleveland Division of Police stopped {{purchasing}} Dodge Chargers {{as their}} primary <b>squad</b> <b>cars</b> and switched to the Ford Taurus. The Division cited that the Dodge Chargers frequently broke down and did not handle big city streets well. The primary reason for the switch however was because the Dodge Charger has a very low ground clearance compared to the Ford Crown Victoria and Ford Taurus, which lead to many <b>squad</b> <b>cars</b> suffering severe undercarriage damage when Cleveland Officers attempted to drive over curbs or through fields while responding to certain incidents and/or calls.|$|R
500|$|The first policemen {{to arrive}} were Steven Spiro and Peter Cullen, {{who were at}} 72nd Street and Broadway when they heard a report of shots fired at the Dakota. The {{officers}} arrived around two minutes later and found Chapman sitting [...] "very calmly" [...] on the sidewalk. They reported that Chapman had dropped the revolver {{to the ground and}} was holding a paperback book, J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. They immediately put Chapman in handcuffs and placed him {{in the back seat of}} their <b>squad</b> <b>car.</b> Chapman made no attempt to flee or resist arrest.|$|E

She told a Miami Herald interviewer, [...] "You get a different perspective by doing research... You can't know what it's like to be a cop even though you've seen it in the movies. But nobody ever saw a 9-1-1 center. I thought they lived in the ground somewhere! It was interesting to see who they were and how they deal and how stressful it can be. I was a wreck watching them. They would just be as cool as can be doing their thing. I thought, 'I could never do this job.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Dr. Stephan Lynn, {{head of the}} Emergency Department, who {{had been}} called in again after having just {{returned}} home after a 13-hour-long work shift, received Lennon {{in the emergency room}} at Roosevelt Hospital a few minutes before 11:00 pm, when Officers Frauenberger and Moran arrived, with Moran carrying Lennon on his back from their <b>squad</b> <b>car</b> and onto a gurney, into the emergency room demanding a doctor for a multiple gunshot wound victim. When Lennon arrived, he had no pulse and was not breathing. Dr. Lynn, two other doctors, a nurse, and two or three other medical attendants worked on Lennon for 10 to 15 minutes {{in a desperate attempt to}} resuscitate him. As a last resort, Dr. Lynn cut open Lennon's chest and attempted manual heart massage to restore circulation, but he quickly discovered that the damage to the blood vessels above and around Lennon's heart from the multiple bullet wounds was too great.|$|E

According {{to some of those}} arrested, they were released late at night or early in the morning. On multiple occasions, Critical Mass participants attempted to ride on Lake Shore Drive, a road off limits to cyclists. Police prevented participants riding on Lake Shore Drive, by blocking entrance ramps with <b>squad</b> <b>cars</b> when Critical Mass riders approach the road.|$|R
500|$|Peckinpah's {{intake of}} alcohol {{increased}} dramatically while making The Getaway, {{and he was}} fond of saying, [...] "I can't direct when I'm sober." [...] He and McQueen got into occasional heated arguments during filming. The director recalled one such incident {{on the first day of}} rehearsal in San Marcos: [...] "Steve and I had been discussing some point on which we disagreed, so he picked up this bottle of champagne and threw it at me. I saw it coming and ducked. And Steve just laughed." [...] McQueen had a knack with props, especially the weapons he used in the film. Hill remembered, [...] "You can see Steve's military training in his films. He was so brisk and confident in the way he handled the guns." [...] It was McQueen's idea to have his character shoot and blow up a <b>squad</b> <b>car</b> in the scene where Doc holds two police officers at gunpoint.|$|E
500|$|Audio {{tracks were}} mixed with {{recorded}} sounds from real subway cars, {{as well as}} PA system announcements, to make the episode sound more authentic. In the original episode, Pembleton grabbed Biedron by {{the collar of his}} shirt while Biedron sat {{in the back of a}} <b>squad</b> <b>car</b> during one of the final scenes. The scene was modified so that Pembleton only looked at Biedron, because Yoshimura felt that the scene was just as effective without him grabbing Biedron. During the last scene of the episode, in which Lange's girlfriend jogs by the subway station and ignores the emergency vehicles, Rabinowitz was originally instructed to include a musical score. He tried many different types of music, including rock music, Irish music, classical music, jazz, and piano riffs. When none of the music worked, Fontana suggested including no music at all, and it was agreed the silence was the most effective solution. Fontana said that after watching the episode repeatedly during the editing process, he liked the final product but doubted he would watch it again for a long time because it was [...] "too emotionally draining".|$|E
500|$|Pembleton and Lange grow closer; Lange {{experiences}} {{more pain}} as time passes, and switches among remorse, anger, and casual small talk during their conversations. Later, Pembleton holds Lange's hand {{to comfort him}} and confides about his recent stroke. Bayliss grows suspicious when Biedron says that he cannot recall his last place of work or {{when he moved to}} Baltimore. Biedron eventually admits that he had been criminally charged and placed into a psychiatric ward for pushing a man in front of a Chicago subway train for no reason. Biedron is arrested, and Bayliss confirms to Pembleton that Lange was pushed; Pembleton decides not to tell Lange because he does not think that it will comfort him, but Lange figures it out for himself by observing their conversation. Lange experiences greater pain and starts to lose consciousness. After saying [...] "I'm OK" [...] to Pembleton, Lange falls unconscious and the EMTs push the train with the airbags. Lange dies immediately after he is removed. A shocked and disoriented Pembleton leaves the subway and, after staring at Biedron {{in the back of a}} police <b>squad</b> <b>car,</b> walks to his vehicle while recalling a line about how sugar maple leaves behave when it rains (a line that Lange said as he was dying). He then drives away with Bayliss. The episode ends with Flannigan jogging past the subway station.|$|E
