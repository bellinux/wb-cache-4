50|$|While {{on a tour}} of Mori Tower on {{the morning}} of March 26, 2004, six-year-old Ryo Mizokawa was killed in a {{revolving}} door at the building's second-floor main entrance. Mizokawa's head was crushed between the door rotating from his left and the outer frame; he died two hours after reaching the hospital. The door's motion <b>safety</b> <b>sensor</b> was originally set to detect anything standing 80 cm tall. This setting was changed to 135 cm, however, after the door began stopping unnecessarily when detecting a newly installed, nearby safety barrier.

40|$|In {{the near}} future, power sources {{may have a}} network {{connector}} on them instead of separate plugs for the robotic interface, wire feeders, gas control devices and operator panels. Compared to present welding cells, the new ones will have fewer cable maintenance headaches, {{and it will be}} easier for users and system integrators to replace or add devices. The power source will download weld schedule and pulse shape program data, and provide measurement information for process control and quality monitoring. Eventually, users will get these benefits without paying more for the equipment. This article describes the basics of network technology. Its goal is to help users of welding equipment identify opportunities where network technology may be beneficial. It will hopefully prepare non-network-experts to follow up with more in-depth reading and investigations.

40|$|Abstract — As mobile robots have {{increasingly}} improved onboard intelligence, {{they are being}} used in more flexible manufacturing, warehouse and/or military environments where humans may intervene and interact with these robots frequently causing increased hazards. The US ASME B 56. 5 - 2004 Safety Standard for industrial trucks was recently changed and now more closely meets the existing British EN 1525 - 1998 Safety Standard for driverless industrial trucks by allowing the use of non-contact <b>safety</b> <b>sensors.</b> Standard-size, material-covered objects, resembling human limb (arm and leg) lengths and diameters positioned in vertical and horizontal orientations, respectively and located within the vehicle path, must be detected and allow the vehicle to react before the vehicle frame contacts these objects. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) supports the automated guided vehicle industry to not only promote advancement of the ASME standard to use non-contact <b>safety</b> <b>sensors</b> but, to also provide performance evaluation of new 3 D real-time range sensor technology toward implementing and further advancing these standards.
