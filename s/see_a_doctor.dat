25|$|Approximately 2,000 {{people die}} from basal or {{squamous}} cell skin cancers (non-melanoma skin cancers) in the United States each year. The rate has dropped in recent years.

25|$|During her German tour, {{she began}} to suffer agonizing pain in her right knee, {{probably}} connected with a fall she had suffered on stage during her tour in South America.

Bernhardt promised to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> {{when she returned to}} Paris, but continued the tour.|$|E
25|$|The main antithyroid {{drugs are}} {{carbimazole}} (in the UK), methimazole (in the US), and propylthiouracil/PTU. These drugs block the binding of iodine and coupling of iodotyrosines. The most dangerous side effect is agranulocytosis (1/250, more in PTU). Others include granulocytopenia (dose-dependent, which improves on cessation of the drug) and aplastic anemia. Patients on these medications should <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> if they develop sore throat or fever. The most common side effects are rash and peripheral neuritis. These drugs also cross the placenta and are secreted in breast milk. Lugol's iodine {{may be used}} to block hormone synthesis before surgery.|$|E
25|$|Sore nipples (nipple pain, or thelalgia) are {{probably}} the most common complaint after the birth. They are generally reported by the second day after delivery but improve within 5 days. Pain beyond the first week, severe pain, cracking, fissures or localized swelling is not normal. The mother should <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> for further evaluation. Sore nipples, a common cause of pain, often come from the baby not latching on properly. Factors include too much pressure on the nipple when not enough of the areola is latched onto and an improper release of suction {{at the end of the}} feeding. Improper use of breast pumps or topical remedies can also contribute. Nipple pain can also be a sign of infection. When the baby bites the nipple it can also be painful.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{points to}} the {{negative}} impact of hegemonic masculinity on men's health-related behavior, with American men making 134.5million fewer physician visits per year than women. Men make 40.8 percent of all physician visits, including women's obstetric and gynecological visits. Twenty-five percent of men aged 45 to 60 do not have a personal physician, increasing their risk of death from heart disease. Men between 25 and 65 are four times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than women, {{and are more likely to}} be diagnosed with a terminal illness because of their reluctance to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor.</b> Reasons cited for not seeing a physician include fear, denial, embarrassment, a dislike of situations out of their control and the belief that visiting a doctor is not worth the time or cost.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (Council of Europe) has {{published}} its report on its 2007 visit to Estonia, stating {{that many of}} the persons detained by the police in connection with the April 2007 events in Tallinn were not granted all the fundamental safeguards (the right of those concerned to inform a close relative or another third party of their choice of their situation, the right of access to a lawyer, and the right of access to a doctor) from the outset of their detention: while many of the persons concerned were allowed to contact someone and to be assisted by a lawyer only when brought before a judge, a number of detained persons claimed that their requests to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> whilst in police custody had been denied, even when they displayed visible injuries.|$|E
25|$|Gleeson and {{his wife}} Dawn have two children, son Taj and {{daughter}} Shae. Gleeson met his wife while in the United States coaching the Sioux Falls Skyforce. Gleeson describes Dawn as a daily inspiration. While {{he and his family}} were living in Townsville, Gleeson urged Dawn to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> after she discovered an unusual lump. A diagnosis of breast cancer followed. Dawn was cancer free for six years until in 2017, she was informed that her breast cancer had recurred. The experience not only inspired Gleeson to become an advocate for women's health, but also a Western Australian Ambassador for the Mother's Day Classic—an annual fun run and walk raising funds and awareness for breast cancer research. On 26 October 2017, at Perth Arena against the Illawarra Hawks, the Wildcats wore pink uniforms to raise awareness and funds for Breast Cancer Care WA.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{invasion}} of Europe in June 1944, more Americans were dying in Home Front accidents than on World War II battlefields. Henry J. Kaiser, founder of the Richmond Shipyards, recognized that only a healthy work force could meet his deadlines and construction needs.

25|$|In {{the sixth}} year of her {{confinement}} in the sanatorium Madonna’s younger brother Orby, {{who also had}} tuberculosis, died. He had begged his sister to have their parents take him home from the sanatorium {{so that he could}} die at home. He was taken home and died later the same day. After being denied the opportunity to attend her brother’s funeral, and the thought of dying in the sanatorium added to Madonna’s desire to leave, which she did without permission and returned to her family home. Facing the threat of quarantine her father refused to return Madonna to the Indian sanatorium. Instead he wrote to an old school friend, Henry Standing Bear, who advised them to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> in Pierre and gain admittance to the “white” TB sanatorium, Sanator at Custer, SD. This was not simple, again due to discrimination because they were Indians the authorities denied her admittance to Sanator, telling them that they {{had to go back to}} the Sioux San. Madonna’s father James Hart Swan would not accept this denial and he gained an audience with the governor of South Dakota, Judge Sigurd Anderson. James Swam explained their situation and the governor, who considered himself somewhat of a pioneer for human rights, understood that American Indians were not treated fairly, arranged for Madonna to be admitted to Sanator.|$|E

[...] Bentley chose to continue playing, but developed into a hypochondriac following the diagnosis.

500|$|In his 1997 book Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema, Randor Guy {{described}} Kalidas as a [...] "crude experiment" [...] {{that had}} poor lip sync; when characters opened their mouths {{there was no}} sound, and when dialogue or song was heard, artistes remained silent. He said the public did not care about technical niceties and flocked to see the film. Film critic and journalist Kalki Krishnamurthy, in his review of the film for Ananda Vikatan, noted that he was awestruck by the costumes used. He praised Rajalakshmi's performance and her dancing but criticised her singing, saying {{that she had to}} go <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> to get her vocal chords fixed. The Tamil newspaper Swadesamitran printed a favourable review for Kalidas on 29 October 1931, two days prior to its theatrical release, where the reviewer, in contrast to Krishnamurthy's comments, appreciated Rajalakshmi's singing.|$|E
