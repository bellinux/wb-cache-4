40|$|There are two {{categories}} of patent infringement: direct infringement and indirect infringement. Legislation in most major {{countries in the world}} {{pay more attention to the}} direct infringement, only some countries highlighted the importance of indirect infringement legislation. Among them, the U. S. is the first country that establish indirect infringement legislation. Base on US indirect infringement legislation, Japan, Germany and other countries established their own systems according to their national conditions and needs. This thesis argues that national legislation should take local industrial advancement into consideration while promulgating indirect infringement acts. Three different types <b>of</b> patents: <b>invention</b> patent, new model patent and new design patent, and corresponding direct infringement determination are introduce in Chapter 2. The difference of the patent infringement determination <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>invention</b> and new design between Taiwan and the United States is addressed in subsequent paragraphs. The patent litigation of direct infringement is compared between Taiwan and the United States in Chapter 3. Issue points and theoretical basis for the dispute cases based on "All element rules", "Doctrine of equivalent" and "Estoppel" are illustrated to clarify arguments leading to conclusion of this thesis. Indirect infringement in the statute and in the patent practice of the United States, Japan, and Germany is discussed in Chapter 4. The United States covered induce infringement, contributory infringement and extraterritoriality while Japan covered only contributory infringement and Germany covered only induce infringement and contributory infringement. This chapter ends up with discussing Taiwan''s amendment draft of indirect infringement and the different views of the issue,we summed up Taiwan''s future direction of legal amendments. In conclusion, suggestion toward legal amendments based on practices in US, Japan and German are given. Industrial implications are also addressed in order to achieve win-win objectives. 專利侵權型態，主要區分為直接與間接侵權，世界各主要國家，多半設有直接侵權制度，只有部分國家有間接侵權的設立，而美國乃間接侵權的首創國，並為該制度的標竿，日、德等參考其制度，再依其本國國情及需求，建立相關而又有差異的制度。 本論文第二章先論述專利種類:發明、新型及新式樣之不同，及直接侵權認定標準，述及台灣及美國之新式樣、發明的專利侵權認定標準，從新式樣專利之本質論起，再依序舉台灣新式樣專利的權利範圍解讀與其侵權認定流程，及美國對應之設計專利的權利範圍解讀與其侵權認定流程。 第三章探討專利直接侵權判決，從製造、使用型態，舉出台灣及美國侵權判決，依全要件原則、均等論、禁反言 [...] -等原則，說明個案爭點與理論依據。 第四章介紹專利間接侵權，說明何謂間接侵權，依序介紹美、日、德的相關法規與判決實務，美國包含:教唆侵權、幫助侵權及域外效力，日本只有幫助侵權，德國則有教唆與幫助侵權，最後說明台灣間接侵權修正草案現況及各方見解，歸納出我國未來修法方向。 第五章就我國產業現況，參酌美、日、德侵權法規及實務運作結果，各別執行上的考量，衍生實務上的差異，提建議給國內廠商未來可能努力方向，也具體說明若要修法，呼應國內外各方聲音，以扶持國內產業為前提，如何能夠達到各取所需雙贏的模式。簡 目 謝 誌 I 中文摘要 II ABSTRACT IV 表 次 VI 圖 次 VII 凡 例 VIII 第一章 緒論 1 第一節 研究動機 1 第一項 專利對於產業的重要性 2 第二項 台、美、中產業現況 2 第二節 研究目的 3 第三節 研究範圍 4 第四節 研究方法 4 第五節 論文回顧 4 第六節 研究架構 8 第二章 專利直接侵權認定標準 10 第一節 專利種類 10 第一項 發明專利 10 第二項 新型專利 11 第三項 新式樣專利 11 第二節 專利直接侵權認定標準 12 第一項 發明（新型）專利侵害認定標準 12 第二項 新式樣專利侵害 40 第三章 專利直接侵權判決 49 第一節 有關製造構成專利侵權之案例 50 第一項 台灣判決 50 第二項 美國判決 77 第二節 有關使用構成專利侵權之案例 79 第一項 台灣判決 79 第四章 專利間接侵權 88 第一節 間接侵權之定義 88 第二節 美國相關規定與判決 89 第一項 美國間接侵權制度的發展歷程與法規 89 第二項 美國判決 98 第三項 本文見解 122 第三節 日本相關規定與判決 123 第一項 日本法規與實務 123 第二項 日本判決 128 第三項 本文見解 130 第四節 德國相關規定與判決 131 第一項 德國法規與實務 131 第二項 德國判決 134 第三項 本文見解 142 第五節 美國、日本、德國專利間接侵權規定比較 143 第一項 德國專利法第 10 條與美國專利法第 271 條第(f) 項之差異 144 第二項 美、日、德客觀行為的比較 144 第六節 我國間接侵權實務 146 第一項 台灣間接侵權可援引法規 146 第二項 間接侵權相關判決 149 第三項 專利法修正草案 152 第四項 專利間接侵權對我國廠商的衝擊 154 第七節 中國大陸間接侵權實務 154 第一項 中國大陸間接侵權可援引法規 155 第二項 間接侵權相關判決 156 第三項 本文見解 158 第五章 結論 160 參考文獻 163 索引 16...|$|R
