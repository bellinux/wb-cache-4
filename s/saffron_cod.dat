Based on stomach {{content analysis of}} over 19,500 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971, 64.1% contained only krill, 25.5% copepods, 5.0% fish, 3.4% krill and copepods and 1.7% squid. Nemoto (1959) analysed the stomach contents of about 7500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and Bering Sea from 1952 to 1958, found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska and schooling fish in the northern Bering Sea and off Kamchatka. In the northern Bering Sea (north of 58Â°N), their main prey species were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii); they also consumed <b>saffron</b> <b>cod</b> (Eleginus gracilis). Arctic krill (Thysanoessa raschii) was the only species of euphausiid found in the stomachs of fin whales in the northern Bering Sea. Off Kamchatka, they appeared to primarily feed on herring. They also took large quantities of the copepod Neocalanus cristatus around the Aleutian Islands and in Olyutorsky Bay off northeast Kamchatka, areas where the species was abundant. Five species of euphausiid (Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera, T. inermis, T. raschii, and T. longipes) were the predominant prey around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska. Prey varied by region in the Kuril Islands area, with euphausiids (T. longipes, T. inermis, and T. raschii) and copepods (Neocalanus plumchrus and N. cristatus) being the main prey in the northern area and Japanese flying squid (Todarodes pacificus pacificus) and small schooling fish (e.g. Pacific saury, Cololabis saira; and Japanese anchovy, Engraulis japonicus) dominating the diet in the southern area.|$|E
25|$|The Nivkh had {{a diverse}} diet being semi-sedentary before colonization. Fish {{was the main}} source of food for the Nivkh, {{including}} pink, Pacific, and chum salmon as well as trout, Red Eye, burbot and pike found in rivers and streams. Salt water fishing provided <b>saffron</b> <b>cod,</b> flatfish, and marine goby caught in the littoral coasts of the Strait of Tartary, Sea of Okhotsk, and the Pacific Ocean, though over fishing by Russian and Japanese trawlers have depleted many of these fish stocks. Additionally, industrial pollution such as phenols and heavy metals in the Amur River have devastated fish stocks and damaged the soil of the estuaries. A traditional preservation process called Yukola, involving slicing the fish in a particular way and drying the strips by hanging them in the frigid air, without salt, was used before foreign influences. The preservation process created a lot of dried fish waste, unpalatable for human consumption but utilized for dog food. Pulverizing dried fish and mixing it with fish skins, water, seal fat, and berries until the mixture had a sour cream consistency is a favorite Nivkh dish called mos. Nivkhs would hunt seal (Larha, Reinged, Reibbon, Sea-lions), duck, sable, and otters. They would gather various berries, wild leeks, lilybulbs, and nuts. Contacts with the Chinese, Manchu, and Japanese from the 12th century on introduced new foods incorporated in the Nivkhs diet such as salt, sugar, rice, millet, legumes and tea. Russian 19th century colonisation introduced flour, bread, potatoes, vodka, tobacco, butter, canned vegetables and fruits, and other meats.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{importance}} of a particular habitat to nearshore fishes can be best assessed by both diurnal and nocturnal sampling. To determine diel differences in fish assemblages in nearshore eelgrass and understory kelp habitats, fishes were sampled diurnally and nocturnally at six locations in western Prince William Sound, Alaska, in summer 2007. Abundance of fish between day and night were similar, but species composition and mean size of some fish changed. Species richness and species diversity were similar in eelgrass {{during the day and}} night, whereas in kelp, species richness and species diversity were greater at night than during the day. In eelgrass, <b>saffron</b> <b>cod</b> (Eleginus gracilis) was the most abundant species during the day and night. In kelp, the most abundant species were Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) during the day and <b>saffron</b> <b>cod</b> at night. Diel differences in fish size varied by species and habitat. Mean length of <b>saffron</b> <b>cod</b> was similar between day and night in eelgrass but was greatest during the day in kelp. Pacific herring were larger at night than during the day in kelp. Diel sampling is important to identity nearshore habitats essential to fish and help manage fish stocks at risk...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The kindneys and the adrenocortical {{tissues of}} toothed smelt, Osmerus mordax dentex and surf smelt, Hypomesus pretiosus japonicus were in-vestigated by light microscopy.

In contrast, the <b>saffron</b> <b>cod,</b> Eleginus gracilis previously observed, showed seasonal difference of the glomerulus which is considered related to the conservation of antifreeze serum glycoprotein. The present results suggest that toothed smelt and surf smelt possess a different adaptive mechanism for cold water {{from that of the}} <b>saffron</b> <b>cod.</b> The adrenocortical tissue is located around the posterior cardinal veins in the head kidney. No seasonal difference in the cross-sectional areas of the nuclei of adrenocortical cells was observed in either the toothed smelt or the surf smelt. It is concluded that the adrenocortical cells are probably not related directly to cold adaptation in these fishes. 1...|$|E

We aimed to characterize the mechanisms of spatial and ontogenetic variation in trophic biomarkers (lipid classes, fatty acids and bulk C and N stable isotopes) of <b>saffron</b> <b>cod</b> from the Western Arctic, Chukchi and Bering Seas. Size-standardized analyses showed a significant difference in lipid condition metrics and trophic biomarkers as a function of survey location. Both ontogeny and sampling location {{played an important role in}} determining lipid stores with elevated levels in both small offshore juveniles (75 mm). Higher lipid storage in Arctic juveniles was associated with elevated levels of diatom fatty acid markers, but not with nearshore carbon input. Increased lipids were found in age- 1 juveniles from Prudhoe Bay in the Western Beaufort that were feeding at a lower trophic level than similarly sized age- 0 juveniles from surface trawls in the Bering Sea. The use of otolith annuli revealed two discrete patterns of growth that help explain the trade-offs between energy storage and rapid growth that diverge between the Arctic and Bering Sea. Laboratory temperature-growth experiments confirmed that <b>saffron</b> <b>cod</b> have a eurythermal growth response and are able to store excess lipids at temperatures as high as 20 Â°C...|$|E

It can be found at: [URL] thermal sensitivity of Arctic fish species is poorly understood, yet such data are a critical component of forecasting and understanding ecosystem impacts of climate change. In this study, we experimentally measured temperature-dependent growth and routine swim activity in the juvenile stage of two Arctic gadids (Arctic cod, Boreogadus saida and <b>saffron</b> <b>cod,</b> Eleginus gracilis) and two North Pacific gadids (walleye pollock, Gadus chalcogrammus and Pacific cod, Gadus macrocephalus) over a 6 -week growth period across five temperatures (0, 5, 9, 16 and 20 Â°C). Arctic cod demonstrated a cold-water, stenothermic response in that there was relatively high growth at 0 Â°C (0. 73 % dayâ»Â¹), near-maximal growth at 5 Â°C (1. 35 % dayâ»Â¹) and negative impacts on activity, growth and survival at 16 Â°C.

However, despite these distinct thermal responses, walleye pollock and Pacific cod grew 2 â 3 times faster than Arctic gadids across a relatively broad temperature range above 5 Â°C. These results, coupled with possible northward expansion by both Pacific cod and walleye pollock, suggest Arctic cod are highly vulnerable to continued climate change in the Arctic, especially in coastal areas of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas where temperatures already exceed 14 Â°C in the summer growth period...|$|E
