25|$|If {{you accept}} that James Moore {{believed}} he won the first bicycle race, then, as he surely cannot have forgotten that his race was at least scheduled to be {{the second of the}} day at St Cloud, there must have been either <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>about</b> the first race – e.g. it was not exclusively for pedal machines – or the order of the events was changed so that his race took place first. My hypothesis assumes the former proposition, and is only partly reliant on whether the rules stated that the front wheels of the velocipedes in the second race were to be precisely 1 metre diameter as stated in your article. My main argument, however, is that the word velocipede was used generically to include all types of machine including even hobby-horses for which it was originally coined. They would surely have had wheels of less than one metre diameter.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times thought the episode continued the series' season three [...] "hot streak", but wished the promo had not spoiled Senator Van Horn being a shapeshifter. Hanson {{also did not}} fully buy into the Peter-Fauxlivia relationship, as he expected Peter to realize <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>about</b> her. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club loved the shapeshifter focus of the episode and graded it an A-, explaining it was a [...] "very strong episode" [...] that [...] "brings back {{one of my favorite}} Fringe concepts: those crazy super-powered shapeshifters". MTV's Josh Wigler also enjoyed the shapeshifter plot, and wrote that [...] "the latest episode of Fringe marks four fantastic installments in a row, instantly establishing season three as having the strongest opening act of any other previous year in the science fiction series. Fringe has reinvented itself by drastically altering just one ingredient in the show's successful format — namely, the true identity of Olivia Dunham — to create something wholly new and amazing". Television Without Pity gave the episode an A-.|$|E

500|$|When Walden {{started to}} look for a record label for Jenkins, Atlantic Records {{representative}} Joe Galkin showed interest and around 1962 sent him to the Stax studio in Memphis. Redding drove Jenkins to the session, as the latter did not have a driver's license. The session with Jenkins, backed by Booker T. & the M.G.'s, was unproductive and ended early; Redding was allowed to perform two songs. The first was [...] "Hey Hey Baby", which studio chief Jim Stewart thought sounded too much like Little Richard. The second was [...] "These Arms of Mine", featuring Jenkins on piano and Steve Cropper on guitar. Stewart later praised Redding's performance, saying, [...] "Everybody was fixin' to go home, but Joe Galkin insisted we give Otis a listen. There was <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>about</b> [...] He really poured his soul into it." [...] Stewart signed Redding and released [...] "These Arms of Mine", with [...] "Hey Hey Baby" [...] on the B-side. The single was released by Volt in October 1962 and charted in March the following year. It became one of his most successful songs, selling more than 800,000 copies.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Tomkins was nine, {{both he and}} his older brother had moved from the Panthers and were {{becoming}} more involved with the amateur Wigan St. Patrick's club, a feeder team for the professional Wigan club. To aid their careers, the family decided to move from Chorley to Wigan, and Tomkins remained playing at the club until his mid-teens. Reflecting on Tomkins' time at Wigan St. Patrick's, Bill Atherton, the club's chairman, remarked that [...] "you could see there was something special when Sam came up through the club. There has always been <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>about</b> him." [...] When he was aged twelve, he obtained a place on the Wigan Warriors scholarship scheme, and when he turned sixteen, Tomkins was offered a part-time contract for the club's academy. By 2007, Tomkins was featuring regularly for the Wigan academy sides. That year, he featured in an under-18s win for the England Academy against France Cadets; his early try helped establish an early England lead before he completed his brace in the second half after a sin-binning for a high tackle. At the end of the year, Wigan rewarded Tomkins with a full-time contract, giving him the opportunity to train alongside players in the club's first team.|$|E
500|$|At the episode's {{conclusion}} {{an alliance}} {{of many of the}} Doctor's enemies appear: the Daleks, Cybermen, Sontarans, Judoon, Autons, Sycorax, Hoix, Silurians, and Roboforms. The Alliance was made up of the [...] "very best" [...] costumes and props they still had in good condition and of the most iconic monsters. So many enemies standing side-by-side had never been seen in the show before. The episode also features Amy battling a Cyberman; Gillan stated she [...] "really wanted" [...] to work with the iconic monster. As the Cyberman had been guarding the Pandorica for a long time, Haynes wanted to make it look [...] "rusted, creaky, and old" [...] and compared its behavior to Frankenstein. The Cyberman was originally played by an amputee with one arm, but the production team was dissatisfied with the camera angle and decided to reshoot the scene from a different angle, but a different actor who had both arms did the part as the amputee was unavailable. A simple solution was devised to cover his arm with a green sleeve made of the same material as a greenscreen, and the final sequence is a combination of both shots. The Cyberman is killed by Rory, who is unaware he is an Auton; this was meant to signify that there was <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>about</b> Rory, as he would have normally panicked in that situation. At the end of the episode Rory is overcome by the Nestene Consciousness's control and shoots Amy, which reflected Moffat's belief that all good love stories end in tragedy.|$|E

500|$|Attending a play {{being held}} at the Little Clam Pre-School about Terri Schiavo, the Griffin family wait eagerly to see Stewie appear in the {{starring}} role as [...] "The Plug." [...] Succumbing to stage fright, however, Stewie wets himself, and begins crying, with Peter recording it all on video tape. Panning the camera down to another row in the auditorium, Peter notices actor Richard Dreyfuss, and begins recording him, while pestering him with personal questions. Deciding to sell the video to TMZ, Peter quickly becomes enthralled with being a Paparazzi, and decides to buy a professional-grade video camera. He then begins recording other town celebrities, including Tom Tucker, Mayor Adam West, and Ollie Williams, the latter whom smashes Peter's camera, {{as well as his}} glasses. Unable to fix them in time for work the next day, he decides to wear contacts instead. Once he arrives at work, his boss, Angela, notices <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>about</b> his appearance and develops a sexual attraction for him. Angela begins hitting on Peter, enlisting him to do various odd sexual favors for her. This culminates in her inviting Peter to her house one evening, which Peter realizes as an attempt to have sex with him. Peter fears of going against her will result in being fired, and agrees to visit Angela. He then enlists his neighbor, Quagmire, to go with him, and hides inside Peter's clothing, planning to have sex with Angela, in the place of Peter. He soon backs out, however, when he finds Angela to be unattractive, leading Peter to have to refuse to have sex with her, and eventually being fired from his job.|$|E

Another song from the album entitled, [...] "Bajo Otra Luz", Furtado proclaimed, is about [...] "when {{you are in a}} {{relationship}} and you are under a light.

[...] The seventh track, [...] "Suficiente Tiempo", is a description of the busy life of an overworked wife who is [...] "trying to make time for a date night". Furtado said that the album was [...] "purposefully collaboration-heavy" [...] because she [...] "want it to sound like a community effort. I wanted it to have all those layers of experience" [...] She also collaborated with Josh Groban on a song entitled, [...] "Silencio" [...] and called the collaboration a [...] "huge blessing."

60|$|During {{the whole}} of the time people had been coming and going from the restaurant, not, perhaps, in a continual stream, but still at fairly regular intervals.

I saw faces, it is true, which I had seen before at the fashionable haunts of Paris, upon the polo ground, at Longchamps, or in the Bois, yet somehow {{it seemed to me that}} they came to this place as different beings. There was a tense look in their faces, a look almost of apprehension, as they entered and passed out,--as of people who have found their way a little further into life than their associates. Louis was right. There was <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>about</b> the place, something at which I could only dimly guess, which at that time I did not understand.

People don't stop to realise the horrible tragedy of even one man's death--one man with his little circle of relatives and friends. In the game of war one forgets. Human beings--men from the toiler's bench, the carpenter's bench, from behind the counter, from the land, from the mine--don khaki, become soldiers, and there seems <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>about</b> them. So many human lives gone every day; just soldiers, just the toll we have to pay for a slight advance or a costly retreat. And, my God, every one of them, underneath their khaki, is a human being!

He {{could not make out}} at first what it was about her: some little added {{fragrance}} that made itself oddly felt, while she herself seemed to be conscious of increased dignity. It was not until he took her hand to say good-bye that he discovered it. There was <b>something</b> <b>different</b> <b>about</b> the feel of her, and, looking down at the little hand that lay in his, he found the reason. She had on a pair of new gloves. They were still of the same fawn colour, but so smooth and soft and cool. They fitted closely without a wrinkle, displaying the slightness and the gracefulness of the hands beneath. The twilight had almost faded, and, save for the broad back of a disappearing policeman, they had the Outer Circle to themselves; and, the sudden impulse coming to him, he dropped on one knee, as they do in plays and story books and sometimes elsewhere, and pressed the little fawn gloves to his lips in a long, passionate kiss. The sound of approaching footsteps made him rise hurriedly. She did not move, but her whole body was trembling, and in her eyes was a look that was almost of fear. The approaching footsteps came nearer, but a bend of the road still screened them. Swiftly and in silence she put her arms about his neck and kissed him. It was a strange, cold kiss, but almost fierce, and then without a word she turned and walked away; and he watched her to the corner of Hanover Gate, but she did not look back.|$|E

Perhaps weekend breakfast {{television}} {{is not the place}} to look for deep insight, and mostly, this syndicated story from NBC about the videogame company Zynga didn't break the mould. There was the usual hyperbole preceding the story, the contextless statistics that are often used to polish the dull handling of videogames in mainstream contexts ('you heard it right, 150 million players!'). There was also the expected low-level banter from the hosts ('Oh, I don't do any of that stuff…'). But there was also <b>something</b> <b>different,</b> <b>something</b> unusual <b>about</b> this story.
