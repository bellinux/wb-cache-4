50|$|The home {{stapling}} machine {{was developed by}} Henry Heyl in 1877 and registered under US Patent No. 195,603. Heyl's companies, American Paper-Box Machine Company, Novelty Paper Box Company, and Standard Box Company, all of Philadelphia, manufactured machinery using staples in paper packaging and for <b>saddle</b> <b>stitching.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Saddle</b> <b>stitch</b> staplers, {{also known}} as [...] "booklet staplers," [...] feature a longer reach from the pivot point than {{general-purpose}} staplers and are used to bind pages into a booklet or [...] "signature". Some, such as the Ring King, can also use [...] "loop-staples" [...] that enable the user to integrate folded matter into ring books and binders.|$|R
50|$|The {{bags are}} {{handmade}} in France using the company's signature <b>saddle</b> <b>stitching,</b> {{developed in the}} 1800s. Each bag is hand-sewn, buffed, painted, and polished, taking several days to finish. Leathers are obtained from different tanners in France, resulting in varying smells and textures. The company justifies {{the cost of the}} Birkin bag, compared to other bags, claiming the degree of craftsmanship involved.|$|R
50|$|A board {{book is a}} type of book {{printed on}} thick {{paperboard}}. The paperboard is printed and used for both the cover and the interior pages. Each page panel is a minimum of two plies of paperboard thickness. Unlike a typical paper book that is bound <b>with</b> <b>saddle</b> <b>stitching</b> (<b>staples)</b> or perfect binding, a board book's pages are specially folded and bound together. Board books are very durable and consequently intended for children, who often tend to be less gentle with books. Most of the board books produced in the world are produced in China and Mexico; however, there is one board book printer still located in the United States and some printers still in Europe.|$|R

The final redesign was arguably the strongest and most consistent finish the magazine had received.|$|R
50|$|Chapbook {{is also a}} term {{currently}} used to denote publications of up to about 40 pages, usually poetry bound with some form of <b>saddle</b> <b>stitch,</b> though many are perfect bound, folded, or wrapped. These publications range from low-cost productions to finely produced, hand-made editions that may sell to collectors for hundreds of dollars. More recently, the popularity of fiction chapbooks has also increased. In the UK they are more {{often referred to as}} pamphlets.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Saddle</b> <b>stitch</b> staplers {{or simply}} saddle staplers are {{bookbinding}} tools designed to insert staples into the spine (saddle) of folded printed matter such as booklets, catalogues, brochures, and manuals. They are distinguished by their unusual length (most traditional staplers are {{too short to}} staple booklets easily) and {{by the presence of}} a V-shaped hump or [...] "saddle" [...] which is used to precisely align the central fold of the material to be stapled.|$|R

The publication's volunteer staff includied Judi James, Mary Brooks, Hazel Sangster and others. The first issue was released to 240 subscribers and local (Superior, Wisconsin-Duluth, Minnesota) newsstands and retailers. The magazine published 12 to 36 pages of fiction and poetry quarterly in an 8.5 x 11 <b>saddle</b> <b>stitched</b> glossy magazine format and attracted submissions from around the U.S. and world.

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of gravure presses print on rolls (also known as webs) of paper or other substrates, rather than sheets. (Sheetfed gravure is a small, specialty market.) Rotary gravure presses are the fastest and widest presses in operation, printing everything from narrow labels to 12-foot-wide (3.66-meter-wide) rolls of vinyl flooring. For maximum efficiency, gravure presses operate at high speeds producing large diameter, wide rolls. These are then cut or slit down to the finished roll size on a slitting machine or slitter rewinder. Additional operations may be in line with a gravure press, such as <b>saddle</b> <b>stitching</b> facilities for magazine or brochure work.|$|R
2500|$|Perineal rectosigmoidectomy aims to resect (remove) the {{redundant}} bowel via the perineum and {{anchor the}} lower rectum to the sacrum through fibrosis {{in the hope}} of preventing future prolapse. The full thickness of the rectal wall is incised at a level just above the dentate line. Redundant rectal and sigmoid wall is removed and the new edge of colon is reconnected (anastomosed) with the anal canal <b>with</b> <b>stitches</b> or <b>staples.</b> This procedure may be combined with a procedure to tighten the pelvic muscles (levatorplasty). A combined a perineal proctosigmoidectomy with anterior levatoroplasty is also called an Altemeier procedure. Levatorplasty is performed to correct elvator diastasis which is commonly associated with rectal prolapse. Perineal rectosigmoidectomy was first introduced by Mikulicz in 1899, and it remained the preferred treatment in Europe for many years. It was Popularized by Altemeier. The procedure is simple, safe and effective. Continence Levatorplasty may enhance restoration of continence (2/3 of patients). Complications occur in less than 10% of cases, and include pelvic bleeding, pelvic abscess and anastomotic dehiscence (splitting apart of the stitches inside), bleeding or leak at a dehiscence Mortality is low. Recurrence rates are higher than for abdominal repair, 16-30%, but more recent studies give lower recurrence rates. Additional levatoroplasty [...] can reduce recurrence rates to 7%.|$|R

40|$|The {{places of}} contact of the LAC-repressor with DNA have been determined. It has been detected, {{that in the}} {{specific}} complex of the LAC-repressor with LAC-operator only lysin- 33 forms the <b>stitch</b> <b>with</b> the partially depurinized DNA, while in all unspecific complexes the N-end of the repressor is being <b>stitched</b> <b>with</b> DNA also. The method of localization of the places of <b>stitching</b> <b>with</b> protein on the DNA has been developed. It has been shown, that in the triple complex inductor-repressor-operator, the N-end of the protein is <b>stitching</b> <b>with</b> {{the edges of the}} LAC-operator. The amino acids are able to <b>stitch</b> only <b>with</b> those modified sites of the DNA, with which they are close in the composition of the DNA-protein complex. Using the obtained results, the conclusion has been made about, that exactly interaction with LAC-operator brings to such orientation of the DNA-connecting domains of the repressor, which had been found earlier by the NMR method. In the presence of the inductor this orientation is opposite. The inductor stabilizes the inverted orientation, preventing from its variation when coupling the protein with the operator. Such is the structural base of switching-out of the LAC-repressor under the inductor actionAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
