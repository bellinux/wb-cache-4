50|$|Following {{her divorce}} from Higgins she neither kept her married nor resumed her maiden name, but rather, for reasons {{she did not}} disclose, chose the surname Dwight. Her reticence about her name was not unusual in her. Even though she wrote an (unpublished) autobiography, much about her life is unknown. Her ability to hear is an example. Most biographic {{summaries}} do not mention a hearing disability. Some <b>say</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> deaf, but do not specify the degree of hearing loss. One source <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> partly deaf and another <b>says</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> profoundly so.|$|R

5|$|This Act made null {{and void}} (with certain {{specific}} exceptions) the Marian act of 1554 that had repealed all Henry VIII's legislation from 1529 onwards, which had denied {{the authority of the}} See of Rome and also confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Supreme Governor was a suitably equivocal title that made Elizabeth head of the Church without ever <b>saying</b> <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> This was important for two reasons: (1) it satisfied those who felt that a woman could not rule the church, and (2) it acted in a conciliatory way toward English Roman Catholics. For the clergy, Elizabeth's changes were more wholesale than those of her half-brother, Edward, had been. All but one (Anthony Kitchin) of the bishops lost their posts, a hundred fellows of Oxford colleges were deprived; many dignitaries resigned rather than take the oath. The bishops who were removed from the ecclesiastical bench were replaced by appointees who would agree to the reforms.|$|E

One of the postulants, Maria Rainer, {{is on the}} nearby mountainside, regretting leaving the {{beautiful}} hills ("The Sound of Music") where she was brought up. She returns late.

On 17 July, Raja Petra was charged with three counts of criminal intimidation over his statutory declaration on the murder of Mongolian translator Altantuya Shaariibuu.

25|$|Initially, all the German naval {{high command}} knew of U-570s {{situation}} was her radio message, <b>saying</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> under air-attack {{and unable to}} submerge; they only learned of her capture from later British press reports. They were concerned {{for the security of}} their communications and Vizeadmiral Erhard Maertens, the head of navy communications, was ordered to report on this. He concluded that in the worst-case scenario—that is, the British had secured U-570s codebooks and Rahmlow had revealed to them his memorised, secret keyword—communications would be compromised until a new list of Enigma machine settings came into force in November. However, he believed this worst case to be unlikely and that U-570s crew would have almost certainly destroyed their secret material. Even if they had not, the additional security of the commander's secret keyword would defeat British cryptanalysis.|$|E
25|$|Immediately after Dušan's death (20 December 1355), {{his wife}} Empress Helena {{was found in}} Serres. She started to exert her {{imperial}} control on the region. This surely was against the goals of Vojihna, which would later on trigger armed conflicts. How the Empress ended up in Serres and started to rule it is unknown, it exists sources <b>saying</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in the region staying away from the harsh winter in the north, just when her husband died. As she was energetic and smart (although not so talented), she might have foreseen the crumbling of the Empire, and sought to rule this region. If this version is correct, Vojihna and his son-in-law Uglješa Mrnjavčević (the son of Vukašin Mrnjavčević) were obliged to work for her as they had done to Dušan, although as the future will tell; with less enthusiasm and fidelity. It is not known how much power Vojihna had in the Serres province, although he most likely had the ambitions of putting it under his control.|$|E
25|$|On the April 8 {{episode of}} SmackDown, {{tension between the}} team rose when McCool refused to tag Layla into a match against Kelly and Phoenix. Layla {{continued}} trying to fix their relationship, but McCool was resistant. Tension was further highlighted in a SmackDown scene where the two were seen undergoing couples therapy. When Layla lost a singles match against Kelly despite McCool's attempts to help her, McCool told Layla she was sick of doing all her work for her, and shoved her over. Finally, On the April 22 episode of SmackDown, McCool turned on Layla by attacking her after the therapy session, thereby disbanding LayCool. During the 2011 WWE Draft, McCool cost Layla a match against Eve Torres. After the match, McCool tried to taunt and bully Layla again, however Layla snapped after all her efforts at trying to keep LayCool together, and viciously attacked McCool, <b>saying</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sick of her, before throwing her at the announce table, thus turning face in the process. On the April 29 episode of SmackDown, Layla and McCool fought to a no contest. After the match, Layla challenged McCool to a No Count Out, No Disqualification match at Extreme Rules. McCool accepted on one condition that the loser leaves WWE. On May 1 at Extreme Rules 2011, Layla defeated McCool which meant {{she had to leave}} WWE. After the match, a debuting Kharma came out and attacked McCool with the Implant Buster. Layla retired on July 29, 2015.|$|E
