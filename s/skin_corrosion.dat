40|$|Corrosion is {{a general}} term for the {{oxidation}} process of metal. In the case of aircraft, corrosion on aluminum airframe skin can often be recognized by dulling or pitting of an area, and sometimes by the white powdery deposit of aluminum corrosion product. Corrosion in these areas means loss of aluminum material from the airframe <b>skin.</b> Thus <b>corrosion</b> can seriously affect the structural integrity of an aircraft unless proper inspection and maintenance is systematically performed. During heavy structural aircraft maintenance, corrosions are still defined mostly in a qualitative rather than a quantitative sense. The qualitative evaluations are biased and unpredictable because corrosions are extremely hard to detect and to predict in their early stages of formation...|$|R
40|$|Although many herbal {{medicines}} {{are effective}} {{in the treatment of}} hyperpigmentation, the potency of different constituents remains unknown. In this work, more than 20, 000 herbal ingredients from 453 herbs were docked into the crystal structures of adenylyl cyclase and a human homology tyrosinase model using Surflex-Dock. These two enzymes are responsible for melanin production and inhibition of them may attain a skin-whitening effect superior to currently available agents. The essential drug properties for topical formulation of the herbal ingredients, including skin permeability, sensitization, irritation, corrosive and carcinogenic properties were predicted by Dermwin, Skin Sensitization Alerts (SSA), <b>Skin</b> Irritation <b>Corrosion</b> Rules Estimation Tool (SICRET) and Benigni/Bossa rulebase module of Toxtree. Moreover, similarity ensemble and pharmacophore mapping approaches were used to forecast other potential targets for these herbal compounds by the software, SEArch and PharmMapper. Overall, this study predicted seven compounds to have advanced drug-like properties over the well-known effective tyrosinase inhibitors, arbutin and kojic acid. These seven compounds have the highest potential for further in vitro and in vivo investigation with the aim of developing safe and high-efficacy skin-whitening agents...|$|R

40|$|Hidden {{corrosion}} detection {{is critical}} in the aerospace industry. Occurring on the inside surfaces or at the interfaces of an aircraft’s <b>skin,</b> the <b>corrosion</b> must be detected from the outside surface.

An experimental study of hidden corrosion/delamination detection in single/multiple layer aluminum plates is conducted with specially selected ultrasonic guided wave modes. Both corrosion simulation specimens by machine cutting, and real corrosion specimens by electrochemical processing, Two-layer specimens have been prepared with such corroded sheets to form an artificial interface corrosion/delamination. Various wave modes are subsequently generated on these specimens to examine the implications of thinning on mode cutoff, group velocity changes, mode frequency shifts, and transmission and reflection amplitudes. Finally, a practical problem of skin to honeycomb core delamination detection with guided waves is also addressed...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of tyrosinase inhibitors is important, {{not only for}} the treatment of skin hyperpigmentation disorders, such as melasma, but also for the production of cosmetic whitening effects. The aim of this study was the in silico prediction of the naturally occurring lead compounds in three commonly used skin-whitening herbs: Ampelopsis japonica, Lindera aggregata, and Ginkgo biloba. The active ingredients responsible for the whitening effect of these herbs remain largely unknown. The tyrosinase binding affinities and skin permeation, skin irritancy, and corrosive properties of 43 natural constituents of the three herbs were predicted by docking simulations using Surflex-Dock and the QSAR-based Dermal Permeability Coefficient Program (DERMWIN (TM)) and <b>Skin</b> Irritation <b>Corrosion</b> Rules Estimation Tool (SICRET) implemented in Toxtree. Nine constituents of the three herbs were found to have more advanced binding energies than the gold standard whitening agents, arbutin and kojic acid, but 40 were indicative of at least one skin sensitization alert, and many exhibited poor skin permeability.

Yet, {{there are a number}} of natural processes that cause surface appearance to vary dramatically, such as burning of wood, wetting and drying of rock and fabric, decay of fruit <b>skins,</b> and <b>corrosion</b> and rusting of steel and copper. In this paper, we take a significant step towards measuring, modeling, and rendering time-varying surface appearance. We describe the acquisition of the first time-varying database of 26 samples, encompassing a variety of natural processes including burning, drying, decay, and corrosion. Our main technical contribution is a Space-Time Appearance Factorization (STAF). This model factors space and time-varying effects. We derive an overall temporal appearance variation characteristic curve of the specific process, as well as space-dependent textures, rates, and offsets. This overall temporal curve controls different spatial locations evolve at the different rates, causing spatial patterns on the surface over time. We show that the model accurately represents a variety of phenomena. Moreover, it enables a number of novel rendering applications, such as transfer of the time-varying effect to a new static surface, control to accelerate time evolution in certain areas, extrapolation beyond the acquired sequence, and texture synthesis of time-varying appearance. ...|$|R

Methods Skin models were incubated with nanoparticles for a definite time period and cell viability was measured by the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2. 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide method. <b>Skin</b> <b>corrosion</b> and irritation were identified by the decreased viability based on the pre-determined threshold. Results Cell viability after exposure to nanomaterial was not decreased to the pre-determined threshold level, which was 15 % after 60 minutes exposure in corrosion test and 50 % after 45 minutes exposure in the irritation test. IL- 1 α release and histopathological findings support the results of cell viability test. In vivo test using rabbits also showed non-corrosive and non-irritant results. Conclusions The findings provide the evidence that zinc oxide nanoparticles, titanium oxide nanoparticles and their mixture are ‘non corrosive’ and ‘non-irritant’ to the human skin by a globally harmonized classification system.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{aerospace}} industry, each year several commercial airplanes stop its service {{to carry out}} detailed routine inspections of their structural members and systems, including the power plant. Among several maintenance services to be performed in an airplane during a check, the corrosion prevention and control program is {{the one of the}} most important service since it includes methods of inspection and tasks to prevent corrosion in all airplane structural areas, such as fuselage, wings, stabilizers, flight control surfaces etc. During routine inspections, upon discrepancy detection, some actions must be immediately taken in order to correct the problem and avoid the loss of airplane structural strength. The corrosion removal from any aircraft structural member, in general consists in blending out the damage and carry out a visual and ND inspection (e. g. remaining thickness measurement by ultrasonic test). However, all care must be taken during remaining thickness measurement since systematic and random errors can affect in the results, compromising the final quality of measured parts. The main purpose of this paper is to perform an experimental study of remaining thickness measurement in an aircraft outer wing <b>skin</b> after <b>corrosion</b> removal, objecting to determine the uncertainty sources of the usual method.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} of a hot-chamber die-cast AZ 91 D {{thin plate}} (1. 4 mm in thickness) {{was investigated in}} terms of its microstructure, to elucidate the role of die-chill <b>skin</b> in <b>corrosion.</b> The die-chill <b>skin</b> was composed of a thin layer of chill zone and a thick layer of an interdendritic Al-rich alpha-Mg/Al 12 Mg 17 beta-phase particle/alpha-Mg grain composite microstructures. The chill zone (4 +/- 1 mu m in thickness) had fine columnar and equiaxed grains and contained a distribution of submicron Mg-Al-Zn intermetallic particles. Beneath the chill zone, Al 12 Mg 17 beta particles were irregularly shaped but did not have an interdendritic network morphology. Furthermore, Al-rich alpha phase (also known as eutectic alpha) was in the interdendritic network, which occupied a higher volume fraction than the beta phase in the die-skin layer. Corrosion characteristics were studied via constant-immersion and electrochemical tests. Although previous studies have ascribed the fine microstructure to good corrosion resistance for the AZ 91 D alloy, the present study showed severe corrosion of the sample with a die skin in chloride solution. Moreover, the sample without the die skin on the surface corroded more slowly. The inferior corrosion performance of the die skin was considered {{to be related to the}} high volume fraction of the interdendritic network of Al-rich alpha phase contained in the die skin, owing to the high cooling rate during solidification.

40|$|Alternative {{test methods}} often use {{prediction}} models (PMs) for converting endpoint measurements into predictions. Two PMs {{are used in}} the OECD Test Guideline No. 431 (TG 431) on <b>skin</b> <b>corrosion.</b> One is specific to EpiSkin™ test method, whereas EpiDerm™, SkinEthic™RHE and epiCS® share a common PM. These four methods are Reconstructed human Epidermis models wherein several cell viability values are measured. Their PMs allow translating those values into sub-categories of corrosive chemicals, Category 1 A (Cat 1 A) and a combination of Categories 1 B/ 1 C (Cat 1 BC), and identifying non-corrosive chemicals. EpiSkin™'s PM already results in sufficiently accurate predictions. The common PM of the three others accurately identifies all corrosive chemicals but, regarding their sub-categorization, an important fraction of Cat 1 BC chemicals (40 - 50 %) is over-predicted as Cat 1 A. This paper presents a post-hoc analysis of validation data on a consistent set of n= 80 chemicals. It investigates (i) why this common PM causes these over-predictions and (ii) how two novel PMs that we developed (PMvar 1 and PMvar 2) improve the predictive capacity of these methods. PMvar 1 is based on a two-step approach; PMvar 2 is based on a single composite indicator of cell viability. Both showed a marked greater capacity to predict Cat 1 BC, and Cat 1 A correct predictions remain at least at the same level of EpiSkin™.

40|$|Most of the {{cosmetic}} compounds with preservative properties {{available in}} the market pose some risks concerning safety, such as the possibility of causing sensitization. Due {{to the fact that}} there are few options, the proper development of new molecules with this purpose is needed. Xylitol is a natural sugar, and the antimicrobial properties of xylitol-derived compounds have already been described in the literature. C- 8 xylitol monoester and xylitol phosphate esters may be useful for the development of skincare products. As an initial screen for safety of chemicals, the combination of in silico methods and in vitro testing can aid in prioritizing resources in toxicological investigations while reducing the ethical and monetary costs that are related to animal and human testing. This study was designed to evaluate the safety of C- 8 xylitol monoester and xylitol phosphate esters regarding carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, skin and eye irritation/corrosion and sensitization through alternative methods. For the initial safety assessment, quantitative structure-activity relationship methodology was used. The prediction of the parameters carcinogenicity/mutagenicity, skin and eye irritation/corrosion and sensitization was generated from the chemical structure. The analysis also comprised physical-chemical properties, Cramer rules, threshold of toxicological concern and Michael reaction. In silico results of candidate molecules were compared to 19 compounds with preservative properties that are {{available in the}} market. Additionally, in vitro tests (Ames test for mutagenicity, cytotoxicity and phototoxicity tests and hen's egg test - chorioallantoic membrane for irritation) were performed to complement the evaluation.

The BfR DSS is a rule-based system {{that could be used}} for the regulatory classification of chemicals in the European Union. The system is based on the combined use of two predictive approaches: exclusion rules based on physicochemical cut-off values to identify chemicals that do not exhibit a certain hazard (e. g. skin irritation/corrosion), and inclusion rules based on structural alerts to identify chemicals that do show a particular toxic potential. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the structural inclusion rules implemented in the BfR DSS for the prediction of <b>skin</b> irritation and <b>corrosion.</b> The following assessments were performed: a) a confirmation of the structural rules by rederiving them from the original training set (1358 substances), and b) an external validation by using a test set of 200 chemicals not used in the derivation of the rules.

The replacement of the Draize test for skin irritation was historically one of the first steps towards the full replacement of animal testing. BASF, and similar chemical companies, use two methods suitable to provide data for classification as corrosive (Epiderm™ <b>skin</b> <b>corrosion</b> test) or irritant (Epiderm™ skin irritation test) to the skin.

In brief, a test substance is applied topically to a reconstructed human epidermis (RhE) that closely mimics the biochemical and physiological properties of the upper parts of the human skin using human derived non-transformed keratinocytes as cell sources.

30|$|Presentations in {{this session}} focused {{exclusively}} on bees and amphibians. It {{was evident that}} there is a need for additional toxicity testing methods for these groups. Annette Aldrich (Agroscope, Wädenswil, Switzerland) reported that amphibians are experiencing increasing pressure from diverse stressors, in particular loss of habitat, and plant protection products (PPP). The data requirement for authorization of PPP in the European Union (EU 283 / 2013) determines that amphibians must be considered to be in prospective environmental risk assessment. However, amphibians do not need to be tested for PPP authorization; therefore, there is a lack of information regarding PPP toxicity to this group. Dermal uptake is considered to be a significant route of exposure, but so far there is no adequate testing system. Katharina Kaufmann (BASF SE, Limburgerhof, Germany) presented the results of a skin absorption in vitro test (OECD TG 428), which was adapted to amphibian skin (Xenopus laevis). Dermal absorption and uptake were quantified using two reference substances, caffeine and testosterone. To address dermal toxicity, an amphibian <b>skin</b> <b>corrosion</b> test based on OECD TG 431 was successfully used.

In such methods, test chemical corrosion/irritation potential is determined by measuring tissue viability using the photometric MTT-reduction assay. A known limitation of this assay is possible interference of strongly coloured test chemicals with measurement of formazan by absorbance (OD). To address this, Cosmetics Europe evaluated use of HPLC/UPLCspectrophotometry as an alternative formazan measurement system. Using the approach recommended by the FDA guidance for validation of bio-analytical methods, three independent laboratories established and qualified their HPLC/UPLC-spectrophotometry systems to reproducibly measure formazan from tissue extracts. Up to 26 chemicals were then tested in RhT test systems for eye/skin irritation and <b>skin</b> <b>corrosion.</b> Results support that: (1) HPLC/UPLC-spectrophotometry formazan measurement is highly reproducible; (2) formazan measurement by HPLC/UPLC-spectrophotometry and OD gave almost identical tissue viabilities for test chemicals not exhibiting colour interference nor direct MTT reduction; (3) independent of the test system used, HPLC/UPLC-spectrophotometry can measure formazan for strongly coloured test chemicals when this is not possible by absorbance only.

Medium was collected to perform IL- 1 ?, IL- 6 and IL- 8 analysis by ELISA, supported by WST- 1 viability-assay, histological and immunohistological investigations. To detect cytochrome P 450 protein (CYP) and heat shock protein 60 (Hsp 60) expression Western blots were performed. Different levels of epidermal barrier damage could be shown for the 4 substances by histological staining. All substances caused viability reduction of 90 % in the skin equivalent. All chemicals led to a significant upregulation of the measured interleukins. In {{the presence of the}} tested irritants, aberrant cytokine release profiles could be observed compared to the sensitizing agent. Induction of CYP isoform 3 A 4 was found for corrosive Butylphenol, Diaminopropane and Aminotriazol, not for sensitising Eugenol. An upregulation of stress marker Hsp 60 could be observed for all test substances. Therefore, CYP isozymes and cytokine release pattern could be relevant indicators to discriminate between corrosive, irritant and sensitizing potentials of chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{wave imaging}} {{has been shown}} to have the {{quantitative}} capability for measuring aircraft <b>skin</b> <b>corrosion</b> thinning. [1] For single fuselage skin, the technique is sensitive to less than 1 % material loss, and can make rapid (a few seconds) measurements which compare well with direct micrometer readings. The method uses pulse heating of the aircraft by means of photographic flashlamps which are enclosed in a metal shroud to trap and funnel the light uniformly onto the surface during the 5 msec duration of the pulse. An infrared (IR) focal plane array camera, aimed and focused at the surface through an opening {{in the rear of the}} hand-held shroud, monitors the rapid cooling of that surface following the pulse. Metal doublers, bonded to the inside surface of the fuselage, cause the outside surface just above them to cool more rapidly, whereas regions which are thinned because of internal surface corrosion cool less rapidly. By appropriate selection of the gate time(s) for monitoring the cooling, these features show up as distinct dark (light) features in the resulting thermal wave images. The system we have developed at Wayne State University has the electronics and computer mounted on a two-wheeled cart, and the imaging head (shroud/lamps/camera) remotely located and connected to the cart by a long (50 -ft) umbilical cable (shown in the photo from the FAA’s Airworthiness Assurance Validation Center (AANC) hangar in Albuquerque, NM) ...|$|E
40|$|No {{studies that}} {{evaluated}} the dermal absorption of HPA {{were identified in}} humans or animals. However, acute toxicity data [Smyth et al. 1969] suggest that HPA is dermally absorbed, systemically available, and potentially fatal. Occupational case reports [Lovell et al. 1985; Kanerva et al. 1988] and animal data [Smyth et al. 1969; BP Chemicals, Inc. 1981] demonstrate that HPA is an irritant and corrosive to the skin. Human patch tests [Lovell et al. 1985; Kanerva et al. 1988, 1992 a, b] and guinea pig maximization tests [Clemmensen 1984] sufficiently demonstrate the skin sensitization potential of HPA. Therefore, {{on the basis of}} these assessments, HPA is assigned a composite skin notation of SK: SYS (FATAL) -DIR (COR) -SEN. Table 3 summarizes the skin hazard designations for HPA previously issued by NIOSH and other organizations. The equivalent dermal designations for HPA, according to the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, are Acute Toxicity Category 3 (Hazard statement: Toxic in contact with the skin), <b>Skin</b> <b>Corrosion</b> Category 1 B (Hazard statement: Causes severe skin burns and eye damage) and Skin Sensitization Category 1 (Hazard statement: May cause an allergic skin reaction) [European Parliament 2008].

40|$|AbstractAlternative {{test methods}} often use {{prediction}} models (PMs) for converting endpoint measurements into predictions. Two PMs {{are used for}} the <b>skin</b> <b>corrosion</b> tests (SCTs) of the OECD Test Guideline No. 431 (TG 431). One is specific to EpiSkin™ test method, whereas EpiDerm™, SkinEthic™ RHE and epiCS® share a common PM. These methods are based on reconstructed human epidermis models wherein cell viability values are measured. Their PMs allow translating those values into sub-categories of corrosive chemicals, Category 1 A (Cat 1 A) and a combination of Categories 1 B/ 1 C (Cat 1 BC), and identifying non-corrosive (NC) chemicals. EpiSkin™'s PM already results in sufficiently accurate predictions. The common PM of the three others accurately identifies all corrosive chemicals but, for sub-categorization, an important fraction of Cat 1 BC chemicals (40 – 50 %) is over-predicted as Cat 1 A. This paper presents a post-hoc analysis of validation data {{on a set of}} n= 80 chemicals. It investigates: why this common PM causes these over-predictions and how two novel PMs that we developed (PMvar 1 and PMvar 2) improve the predictive capacity of these methods. PMvar 1 is based on a two-step approach; PMvar 2 is based on a single composite indicator of cell viability. Both showed a greater capacity to predict Cat 1 BC, while Cat 1 A correct predictions remaining at least at the same level of EpiSkin™. We suggest revising TG 431, to include the novel PMs in view of improving the predictive capacity of its SCTs...|$|E
40|$|The ECVAM Skin Irritation Task Force was {{established}} in November 1996, primarily to prepare {{a report on the}} current status of the development and validation of alternative tests for skin irritation and corrosion and, in particular, to identify any appropriate non-animal tests for predicting human skin irritation which were sufficiently well-developed to warrant ECVAM supporting their prevalidation/validation. The task force based its discussions around the proposed testing strategy for skin irritation/corrosion emanating from an OECD workshop held in January 1996. The following have been reviewed: a) structure-activity and structure-property relationships for <b>skin</b> <b>corrosion</b> and irritation, b) the use of pH and acid/alkaline reserve measurements in predicting skin corrosivity; c) in vitro tests for skin corrosion; d) in vitro tests for skin irritation (keratinocyte cultures, organ cultures, and reconstituted human skin models), and e) human patch tests for skin irritation, It was apparent that, although several promising candidate in vitro tests for skin irritation (for example, reconstituted human skin methods, and human and animal skin organ culture methods) were under development and evaluation, a test protocol, a preliminary prediction model and supporting data on different types of chemicals were only available for a method employing EpiDerm™. Thus, it is proposed that this EpiDerm test undergoes prevalidation during 1998. In addition, since it was felt preferable to be able to include other in vitro tests in such a prevalidation study, it is recommended that a "challenge" be set to anyone interested in taking part. This involves submitting data on ten test chemicals selected by the task force, obtained according to a standard protocol with a preliminary prediction model, for review by the task force by 31 May 1998...|$|E
