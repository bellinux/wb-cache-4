5000|$|A {{buildup of}} orotic acid {{can lead to}} orotic aciduria and acidemia. It may be a symptom of an {{increased}} ammonia load due to a metabolic disorder, such as a urea cycle disorder.

This leads to an increased serum ammonia level, increased <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> orotic acid levels and a decreased serum blood urea nitrogen level. This also leads to an increased urinary orotic acid excretion, because the orotic acid is not being properly utilized and must be eliminated.

Methods A total of 105 patients with cirrhotic ascites who were admitted to Sichuan Provincial People′s Hospital from January 2015 to June 2016 were enrolled and divided into AKI group with 56 patients and non-AKI group with 49 patients. Meanwhile, 40 healthy persons who underwent physical examination were enrolled as controls. The indices including serum Cys C, urinary NGAL, <b>serum</b> creatinine (Scr), <b>and</b> glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were observed. The 105 patients with cirrhotic ascites were divided into subgroups according to Child-Pugh class, and the changes in serum Cys C, <b>urinary</b> NGAL, Scr, <b>and</b> GFR were compared between these subgroups. The independent samples t-test was used for comparison of continuous data between two groups; a {{one-way analysis of variance}} was used for comparison between multiple groups, and the SNK-q test was used for further comparison between any two groups. The chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between groups, and a Pearson correlation analysis was also performed. Results There were significant differences in the levels of <b>serum</b> Cys C <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> NGAL between the AKI group and the non-AKI group, as well as between the AKI group and the healthy control group (all P＜ 0. 01).

The objective {{of this study is}} to prove that the increase in <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> NGAL are correlated with kidney tubular epithelial damage, and this increase has occurred in initiation phase, indicated by rat kidney histopathology in an early I/R model. Methods: Twenty eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: 4 hour sham (Sham 4), 8 hour sham (Sham 8), 10 minute ischemia 4 hour reperfusion (I/R 4) and 10 minute ischemia 8 hour reperfusion (I/R 8). Blood, urine and kidney samples were collected. Serum creatinine level was analyzed with Jaffe method, while <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> NGAL level were analyzed with direct sandwich ELISA method. Evaluation of kidney damage were measured semi quantitatively in tissue stained with HE. Further evaluation to confirm cellular changes on kidney was performed by electron microscope and immunohistochemistry. Results: Serum NGAL was found significantly correlated with degree of kidney tissue damage (ρSpearman NGAL serum = 0. 701, p < 0. 001), also urinary NGAL (ρSpearman = 0. 689, p < 0. 001). NGAL expression differs significantly between I/R group and sham (t-test, t = - 26635. 056, p < 0. 001), also kidney damage (t-test, t = - 5. 028, p < 0. 001), and <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> NGAL levels (Mann-Whitney, U = 0, p < 0. 001).

30|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} whether chloride <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> levels {{as well as}} chloride load, balance and the anion urinary gap in the first day since admission {{are associated with the}} development of AKI among CA survivors.|$|E
40|$|In rabbit with nephritis, {{experimentally}} created b y {{injection of}} mercuric chloride, <b>urinary</b> <b>and</b> <b>serum</b> mucoprotein <b>and</b> protective <b>urinary</b> colloids were investigated, and relation of these substances to <b>urinary</b> <b>and</b> <b>serum</b> calcium was investigated. The results are. 1) <b>Urinary</b> <b>and</b> <b>serum</b> mucoprotein was increased within 1 to 2 days after inje c tion of mercuric chloride, {{and the two}} values retained parallel relation {{in most of the}} cases. 2) Increase of protective urinary colloids ran parallel with that of urinary mucoprotein. In some cases, however, protective urinary colloids showed little fluctuation. 3) Injection of mercuric chloride to rabbit caused little alteration of <b>serum</b> calcium level, <b>and</b> within 2 to 3 days n pronounced increase of the urinary calcium level was noted. This was restored to normal within a week to 10 days. 4) A constant correlation between urinary ca l c ium, <b>urinary</b> <b>and</b> <b>serum</b> mucoprotein <b>and</b> protective <b>urinary</b> colloids was observed. It is indicated from these results that urinary mucoprotein may originate partly from <b>serum</b> mucoprotein <b>and</b> partly from the epithelium of degenerated renal tubule and that mucoprotein and mucopolysaccharides may play an important role, associated with hyp ercalcinuria, in calculus formation of urinary tract...|$|R
40|$|Handigodu Disease (HD) is a {{disorder}} of the osteoarticular system which is highly prevalent in several villages of two districts viz, Shimoga and Chikmaglur {{of the state}} of Karnataka, southern India. The scientific name of the disease is Spondylo-epi-(meta) physeal Dysplasia, Autosomal Dominant variety, Handigodu syndrome. The same has been listed in the International Classification of Skeletal Dysplasias. The calcium homeostasis study was lack in HD. The serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone and calcitonin levels after overnight fast state, <b>and</b> 24 hour <b>urinary</b> excretion of calcium and phosphorus were quantified. The decreased level of calcitonin associated with decreased <b>serum</b> total calcium <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> calcium in HD were observed. The levels of parathyroid hormone, <b>serum</b> phosphorus <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> phosphorus remain unchanged among HD affected. The Vitamin D 3 levels also noticed unchanged in HD affected. Since calcitonin has antiresorption effect on bone, the observed low calcitonin in HD may imply reosrption of bone leading to deformity and causes hypocalcaemia and hypocalciuria. The hypocalcitonemia without change in iPTH associated with hypocalcaemia may be a mutation in Vit D receptor (VDR) or may be an epiphenomenon...|$|R
30|$|In {{this group}} of patients, we {{demonstrated}} a significant relationship of the GSK- 3 β genotype only with one aspect of kidney function, the urinary concentrating ability. We {{did not find any}} significant association in the remaining parameters measured. However, some hint could come from the numerically lower values of <b>serum</b> NGAL <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> β 2 -MG in the CC homozygotes compared to other genotypes. These values could achieve statistical significance with a higher number of patients possessing the C/C genotype.|$|R
