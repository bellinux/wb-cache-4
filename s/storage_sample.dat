The present article provides {{an update on the}} state of knowledge for the use of bile in forensic toxicology, through a review of the Medline literature from 1970 to May 2015. Bile physiology and technical aspects of analysis (sampling, <b>storage,</b> <b>sample</b> preparation and analytical methods) are reported, to highlight specificities and consequences from an analytical and interpretative point of view.

Qualitative and quantitative interpretation is discussed. As bile/blood concentration ratios are high for numerous molecules or metabolites, bile is a matrix of choice for screening when blood concentrations are low or non-detectable: e. g., cases of weak exposure or long intake-to-death interval. Quantitative applications have been little investigated, but small molecules with low bile/blood concentration ratios seem to be good candidates for quantitative bile-based interpretation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability to}} analyze cryopreserved {{peripheral}} blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) from biobanks for antigen-specific immunity {{is necessary to}} evaluate response to immune-based therapies. To ensure comparable assay results, collaborative research in multicenter trials needs reliable and reproducible cryopreservation that maintains cell viability and functionality. A standardized cryopreservation procedure is comprised of not only sample collection, preparation and freezing but also low temperature storage in liquid nitrogen without any temperature fluctuations, to avoid cell damage.

We compared the influence of repeated temperature fluctuations on cell health from sample <b>storage,</b> <b>sample</b> sorting and removal in comparison to sample storage without temperature rises.

40|$|Abstract Background Reelin, intensively {{studied as}} an {{extracellular}} protein that regulates brain development, is also {{expressed in a}} variety of tissues and a circulating pool of reelin exists in adult mammals. Here we describe the methodological and biological foundation for carrying out and interpreting clinical studies of plasma reelin. Results Reelin in human plasma was sensitive to proteolysis, freeze-thawing and heating during long-term <b>storage,</b> <b>sample</b> preparation and electrophoresis. Reelin in plasma was a dimer under denaturing conditions. Boiling of samples resulted in laddering, suggesting that each of the 8 repeats expressed in reelin contains a heat-labile covalent bond susceptible to breakage. Urinary-type and tissue-type plasminogen activator converted reelin to a discrete 310 kDa fragment co-migrating with the major immunoreactive reelin fragment seen in plasma and also detected in brain. (In contrast, plasmin produced a spectrum of smaller unstable reelin fragments.) We examined archival plasma of 10 pairs of age-matched male individuals differing in repeat length of a CGG repeat polymorphism of the 5 '-untranslated region of the reelin gene (both alleles 11 repeats). Reelin 310 kDa band content was lower in subjects having the long repeats in all 10 pairs, by 25 % on average (p Conclusions Our studies indicate the need for caution in measuring reelin in archival blood samples, and suggest that assays of plasma reelin should take into account three dimensions that might vary independently: a) the total amount of reelin protein; b) the relative amounts of reelin vs. its proteolytic processing products; and c) the aggregation state of the native protein. Reelin-plasminogen activator interactions may affect their roles in synaptic plasticity. Our results also suggest that the human CGG repeat polymorphism affects reelin gene expression, and may affect susceptibility to human disease. </p...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDue to the {{diversity}} of antibody (Ab) -based biochips chemistries available and the little knowledge about biochips resistance to space constraints, immobilization of Abs {{on the surface of}} the biochips dedicated to Solar System exploration is challenging. In the present paper, we have developed ten different biochip models including covalent or affinity immobilization with full-length Abs or Ab fragments. Ab immobilizations were carried out in oriented/non-oriented manner using commercial activated surfaces with N-hydroxysuccinic ester (NHS-surfaces) or homemade surfaces using three generations of dendrimers (dendrigraft of poly L-lysine (DGL) surfaces). The performances of the Ab -based surfaces were cross-compared on the following criteria: (i) analytical performances (expressed by both the surface density of immobilized Abs and the amount of antigens initially captured by the surface) and (ii) resistance of surfaces to preparation procedure (freeze-drying, storage) or spatial constraints (irradiation and temperature shifts) encountered during a space mission. The latter results have been expressed as percentage of surface binding capacity losses (or percentage of remaining active Abs). The highest amount of captured antigen was achieved with Ab surfaces having full-length Abs and DGL-surfaces that have much higher surface densities than commercial NHS-surface. After freeze-drying process, thermal shift and <b>storage</b> <b>sample</b> exposition, we found that more than 80 % of surface binding sites remained active in this case. In addition, the resistance of Ab surfaces to irradiation with particles such as electron, carbon ions or protons depends not only on the chemistries (covalent/affinity linkages) and strategies (oriented/non-oriented) used to construct the biochip, but also on the type, energy and fluence of incident particles. Our results clearly indicate that full-length Ab immobilization on NHS-surfaces and DGL-surfaces should be preferred for potential use in instruments for planetary exploration...|$|E
40|$|Background: DNA {{isolation}} and PCR amplification from molluscan taxa is considered as problematic because polysaccharides in tissue and mucus presumably co-precipitate with the DNA and inhibit {{the activity of}} DNA polymerase. In the present study we tested two common extraction methods on specimens from the mollusc collection of the Natural History Museum Vienna (NHMW). We analysed a broad variety of taxa covering a large temporal span (acquisition years 1877 to 1999), which distinguishes our study from previous ones where mostly fresh material was used. We also took other factors into account: effects of sample age, effects of formaldehyde treatment and taxon-specific problems. We used several primer combinations to amplify amplicons of different lengths of two mitochondrial genes: cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and 16 S rRNA gene (16 S). Results: Overall PCR success was 43 % in the 576 extractions (including all primer combinations). The smallest amplicon (~ 240 bp) showed the best results (49 % positive reactions), followed by the 400 bp amplicon (40. 5 %). Both short sections yielded significantly better results than the 700 bp long amplicon (27 %). Comparatively, the Gen-ial-First, All-tissue DNA-Kit—extraction method performed significantly better than Promega-Tissue and Hair Extraction Kit. Generally, PCR success is age-dependent. Nonetheless, {{we were able to}} obtain the longest amplicon even from 137 -year-old material. Importantly, formaldehyde traces did not totally inhibit amplification success, although very high concentrations did. Conclusions: Museum material has gained importance for DNA analysis in recent years, especially for DNA barcoding projects. In some cases, however, the amplification of the standard barcoding region (partial sequence of the COI) is problematic with old material. Our study clearly shows that the COI barcoding region could be amplified in up to 49 % of PCRs (varying with amplicon length), which is, for museum samples, quite a high percentage. The difference between extraction methods was minimal and we recommend using an established kit for a first attempt because experience and routine in handling might be more important than slight performance differences of the various kits. Finally, we identify fixation, <b>storage,</b> <b>sample</b> conservation and documentation of the specimens’ history rather than the DNA extraction method to be the most crucial factors for PCR success...|$|E
40|$|The {{desire to}} use the tools and {{concepts}} of chemometrics when studying problems in the life sciences, especially biology and medicine, has prompted chemometricians to shift their focus away from their field‘s traditional emphasis on model predictivity and towards the more contemporary objective of optimizing information exchange via model interpretation. The complex data structures that are captured by modern advanced analytical instruments open up new possibilities for extracting information from complex data sets. This in turn imposes higher demands {{on the quality of}} data and the modeling techniques used. The introduction of the concept of orthogonal variation in the late 1990 ‘s led to a shift of focus within chemometrics; the information gained from analysis of orthogonal structures complements that obtained from the predictive structures that were the discipline‘s previous focus. OPLS, which was introduced in the beginning of 2000 ‘s, refined this view by formalizing the model structure and the separation of orthogonal variations. Orthogonal variation stems from experimental/analytical issues such as time trends, process drift, <b>storage,</b> <b>sample</b> handling, and instrumental differences, or from inherent properties of the sample such as age, gender, genetics, and environmental influence. The usefulness and versatility of OPLS has been demonstrated in over 500 citations, mainly in the fields of metabolomics and transcriptomics but also in NIR, UV and FTIR spectroscopy. In all cases, the predictive precision of OPLS is identical to that of PLS, but OPLS is superior {{when it comes to the}} interpretation of both predictive and orthogonal variation. Thus, OPLS models the same data structures but provides increased scope for interpretation, making it more suitable for contemporary applications in the life sciences. This thesis discusses four different research projects, including analyses of NIR, FTIR and NMR spectroscopic data. The discussion includes comparisons of OPLS and PLS models of complex datasets in which experimental variation conceals and confounds relevant information. The PLS and OPLS methods are discussed in detail. In addition, the thesis describes new OPLS-based methods developed to accommodate hyperspectral images for supervised modeling. Proper handling of orthogonal structures revealed the weaknesses in the analytical chains examined. In all of the studies described, the orthogonal structures were used to validate the quality of the generated models as well as gaining new knowledge. These aspects are crucial in order to enhance the information exchange from both past and future studies...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the {{development}} of synthesis and characterisation protocols for two different nanoparticulate materials; hydroxyapatite (HA), a biomaterial well recognised as chemically akin to human bone, and CaO, a material often used for the sequestration of CO 2 at elevated temperatures. For the analysis of these materials various bulk and particle level characterisation techniques have been employed, which are complemented by the versatile analytical methods available in the transmission electron microscope (TEM). The first chapter of results reveal that a hydrothermal synthesis route achieved phase-pure nanoparticulate HA with Ca/P atomic ratios close to the stoichiometric target (1. 67). Impure HA nanopowders were produced by a sol-gel synthesis route with analysis by X-ray diffraction (XRD) revealing secondary phases of calcium phosphates, CaCO 3 and CaO. The Ca/P ratios of each powder were determined at the particle level using TEM with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDX), having first established a threshold electron fluence below which significant electron-beam-induced alteration of the composition of HA does not occur. Results showed a greater variability of particle composition from the sol-gel preparation route compared to the hydrothermal route. This technique provides results in reasonable agreement to bulk Ca/P ratio analysis carried out by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The second component of the thesis relates to the production of nanoparticulate CaO powder sorbents for the sequestration of CO 2 gas. The CaO nanopowders were produced by the thermal decomposition of calcium acetate hydrate (CaAc); this process was analysed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and by in-situ hot-stage XRD. The CO 2 uptake capability of the CaO powder sorbents was analysed by TGA following the reaction: CaO + CO 2 ↔ CaCO 3 Results showed a molar conversion ratio, χ (of CaO to CaCO 3) of 0. 92, after 15 minutes of carbonation with structural analysis by SEM and TEM showing consistent growth and densification of rounded CaCO 3 crystals upon carbonation. Multiple cycles of carbonation and decarbonation were then carried out by TGA to investigate sorbent regenerability. A 0. 32 decrease in χ was found after 9 cycles which is attributed to the sintering (reduction in surface area) of the sorbent with progressive decarbonations at 800 °C. Structural analysis of decarbonated samples extracted from the TGA, by XRD, SEM and TEM, highlighted the issue of sorbent hydration upon <b>storage,</b> <b>sample</b> preparation and analysis. A TEM based technique has been developed for the structural analysis of multicycle CO 2 capture using an ex-situ environmental cell (E-cell). This technique allows for multicycle capture to be carried out and then analysed in the TEM with minimal exposure to the atmosphere, therefore providing a closer microstructural match to what occurs in the TGA. Results showed that slow, low-vacuum decarbonation (in the E-cell) creates a densified ‘skeleton’ of CaO, consistent with the drop in capture capacity observed by TGA. Finally, modifications of CaO sorbents using spacer materials has been carried out with the aim of declining the decay in sorbent performance during multiple cycles of carbonation and decarbonation in the TGA. Promising results were found using CaO sorbents modified a commercial YSZ powder and also with CaZrO 3 /ZrO 2...|$|E

The corncobs from the summer crop samples had the lowest counts of Aspergillus sp. and did not have aflatoxins. We detected aflatoxins at concentrations of 2. 8 - 14. 5 and 3 - 197. 5 µg kg- 1 in the winter and summer crop samples, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of detection of a wild-type strain of Toxoplasma gondii by cell culture, mouse inoculation, and PCR was determined following <b>sample</b> <b>storage</b> under conditions to which clinical specimens may be subjected during transport to the testing laboratory. <b>Sample</b> <b>storage</b> at - 20 degrees C significantly decreased the {{sensitivity of}} mouse inoculation. The sensitivity of cell culture decreased with <b>sample</b> <b>storage</b> at 4 and - 20 degrees C. The sensitivity of PCR was reduced by storage at 4 degrees C for 48 h, freezing, and heating. These findings have implications for the selection of appropriate methods for the direct detection of T. gondii organisms in suboptimally transported clinical samples...|$|R
50|$|The National Biodiesel Accreditation Program is a {{cooperative}} and voluntary {{program for the}} accreditation of producers and marketers of biodiesel fuel called BQ-9000. The program is a unique combination of the ASTM standard for biodiesel, ASTM D6751, and a quality systems program, which includes <b>storage,</b> <b>sampling,</b> testing, blending, shipping, distribution, and fuel management practices. BQ-9000 is open to any biodiesel manufacturer, marketer, or distributor of biodiesel and biodiesel blends in the U.S. and Canada. Companies must pass a rigorous review and inspection of their quality control processes by an independent auditor. The National Biodiesel Accreditation Commission (NBAC) issues a “BQ-9000 producer” or “BQ-9000 Marketer” seal of approval for those who pass.|$|R

40|$|A {{portable}} ultrahigh-vacuum <b>sample</b> <b>storage</b> {{system was}} designed and built to investigate the detailed geometric structures of mass-selected metal clusters on oxide substrates by polarization-dependent total-reflection fluorescence x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (PTRF-XAFS). This ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) <b>sample</b> <b>storage</b> system provides the handover of samples between two different sample manipulating systems. The <b>sample</b> <b>storage</b> system is adaptable for public transportation, facilitating experiments using air-sensitive samples in synchrotron radiation or other quantum beam facilities. The samples were transferred by the developed portable UHV transfer system via a public transportation at a distance over 400 km. The performance of the transfer system was demonstrated by a successful PTRF-XAFS study of Pt- 4 clusters deposited on a TiO 2 (110) surface...|$|R
