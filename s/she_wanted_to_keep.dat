500|$|Rihanna {{explained}} that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the audience dancing and be soulful {{at the same}} time. She sought to make an album that people would listen to without skipping tracks. She cited Afrodisiac (2004), the fourth studio album by American singer Brandy Norwood, as her main inspiration for the album. In May 2007, Rihanna revealed that she called the album Good Girl Gone Bad because it represents her bolder and more independent image: [...] "I'm not the innocent Rihanna anymore. I'm taking a lot more risks and chances. I felt when I cut my hair, it shows people I'm not trying to look or be anybody else. The album is very edgy." ...|$|E

500|$|For 2002's Roses, Mattea {{moved to}} Narada Productions. She {{said that she}} chose to work with this label after leaving Mercury because she felt that the label would [...] "give [...] {{alternative}} marketing ideas" [...] and [...] "didn't see [...] musical restlessness as a liability". She said that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a contemporary folk and Celtic influence. Mattea supported the album with a tour largely focused on performing arts centers. Narada serviced [...] "They Are the Roses" [...] to Adult Contemporary and country stations, and [...] "I'm Alright" [...] to Adult album alternative and Americana music formats. Maria Konicki Dinoia wrote in Allmusic that [...] "she pushes the envelope, bringing to the forefront the blending of the Scottish/Irish music found in small doses on her last few albums." [...] One year later, she released her second Christmas disc, Joy for Christmas Day, which continued in her Celtic music influences. This album was inspired by her annual Christmas tours that she had done ever since the release of Good News.|$|E

500|$|... "Say Yes" [...] {{was written}} by Williams, Carmen Reece, Al Sherrod Lambert and Harmony Samuels who also served as its producer. The song marked the third {{collaboration}} of the trio consisting of Williams, Beyoncé and Kelly Rowland, after their group Destiny's Child disbanded in 2006. Williams sent an advanced demo of the album Journey to Freedom to her former bandmates Beyoncé and Rowland which contained the song as a solo track titled [...] "When Jesus Says Yes". Later, Williams {{received a call from}} Rowland who said, [...] "We love 'When Jesus Says Yes'... {{there has to be a}} Destiny's Child mix of the song." [...] Both Rowland and Beyoncé recorded their respective verses in a studio afterwards. Williams stated <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the project in secrecy [...] "until it was time" [...] to reveal it. During an interview with Rap-Up, Beyoncé spoke about her decision to be a featured artist on the song, stating, [...] "This song is so inspiring and... not enough music out there like this and I'm proud to be a part of it."

The singer said she didn't intend to make any of her tracks romantic, though you can apply the tracks to romance and love. She said the song means; [...] "this is it, when I am with you I could be anywhere and I feel at home".|$|E

Again, Jones reported she agreed, and was surprised to discover the letter was delivered to the same Dr. Jensen who had treated her in the Philippines nearly two decades earlier. Jones said that Jensen and his associate, Dr. [...] "Marshall Burger" [...] (another pseudonym) offered hefty amounts of cash if she was willing to engage in further plans; in their earlier meetings, Jensen had noted that Jones was an ideal subject for hypnosis. Jones agreed, she said, because her modeling school was faltering, and <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her sons in their costly private schools.|$|E

2500|$|On reflection, Hantuchová {{said that}} 2012 was a {{difficult}} year for her. She struggled with niggling injuries even before she fractured her foot and was forced out for two months. As a result, her form was inconsistent and she suffered ten first round defeats. She said: [...] "I think 2012 has been a difficult year for me. Had a great start to the season, making the final in Brisbane, winning in Pattaya and feeling very good about my game, but unfortunately, suffered a fracture stress... that kept {{me away from the}} tracks for two months." [...] However, she said that playing in the Olympics at Wimbledon, where she reached the third round, was a [...] "special moment".

2500|$|In {{the course}} of writing [...] (1931), Stuart Lake learned that Josephine had lived with Johnny Behan in Tombstone {{and other aspects of}} Josephine's life that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> private. At one point in their {{contentious}} relationship, Josephine described Lake's book as made up of [...] "outright lies". Josephine and Wyatt {{went to great lengths to}} keep her name out of Lake's book, and she threatened litigation to keep it that way. After Wyatt died in 1929, Josephine traveled to Boston, Massachusetts to try to persuade the publisher to stop the release of the book. Although the biography became a bestseller, it was later strongly criticized for fictionalizing Earp's life and was found to be markedly inaccurate. As late as 1936, Josephine took legal action to suppress certain details of her and Wyatt's life in Tombstone. During those later years of her life, in addition to burnishing the life and legend of husband Wyatt Earp, [...] "she scripted a history of make believe to hide a number of things of which she was not terribly proud." ...|$|E

Sandé {{revealed}} that she wanted to bring poetry back into music, as it has been lost. The songs which are currently being released are for the [...] "moment" [...] as they make us feel good and we can dance to them, Sandé said. She said that Our Version of Events will see poetry lyrics, as she intends to bring them back into fashion. She said; Great songwriters come along quite rarely, but when I listen to Tracy Chapman or Joni Mitchell, these are people who pay attention to the lyric and are precise about it. I feel that has been put second to having a cool producer or whether the kids will like it. She said that the music industry is hard to get into, but once you are in, it is very loyal. In the recording studio, Syco Music heard some of Sandé's songs which they wanted, but she refused and told them <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them for her own album. They later asked her to write for some of their artists, and Leona Lewis went into the studio with her and Naughty Boy to record for a couple of weeks, and she said that her and Lewis had a lot in common. She also said that Lewis has a phenomenal voice and she was lovely.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{all of the}} controversy, Mann {{was never}} charged with the taking or selling of child pornography, even though, {{according}} to Edward de Grazia, law professor and civil liberties expert, “any federal prosecutor {{anywhere in the country}} could bring a case against [...] in Virginia, and not only seize her photos, her equipment, her Rolodexes, but also seize her children for psychiatric and physical examination.” Mann always put her children's well-being first. Before she published Immediate Family, she consulted a Virginian Federal prosecutor who told her that some of the images she was exhibiting could have her arrested. She decided to postpone the publication of the book in 1991. In an interview with New York Times reporter, Richard Woodward, she said “I thought the book could wait 10 years, when the kids won’t be living in the same bodies. They’ll have matured and they’ll understand the implications of the pictures. I unilaterally decided.” The children apparently did not like this decision and Mann and her husband arranged for Emmett and Jessie to talk to a psychologist to be sure their feelings were honest and so that they understood what the publication would do. Each child was then allowed to vote on which photographs were to be put in the book. To further protect the children from “teasing,” Mann told Woodward that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> copies of Immediate Family out of their home town of Lexington. She asked bookstores in the area not to sell it and for libraries to keep it in their rare-book rooms. Dr. Aaron Esman, a child psychiatrist at the Payne Whitney Clinic believes that Mann is serious about her work and that she has “no intention to jeopardize her children or use them for pornographic images.” He says that the nude photographs don’t appear to be erotically stimulating to anyone but a “case-hardened pedophile or a rather dogmatic religious fundamentalist.” Mann states, [...] "I didn't expect the controversy over the pictures of my children. I was just a mother photographing her children as they were growing up. I was exploring different subjects with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} in 2007, after finishing with his rehabilitation, Morgan explained how the song had [...] "haunted" [...] him around and badly affected his reputation. He stated {{that it was not}} pleasant to hear a song describing him as a [...] "bad guy" [...] which [...] "millions of people have heard". He elaborated, [...] "I was bummed out. I was really upset that she would say and do those things. In any relationship, I don't think it's right to say and do those things when people break up, and she obviously felt the need {{to go out there and}} make me sound like a complete a--hole ... I just refuse to lower myself to that level. But it was a painful thing and it got me down." [...] At the time of the interview, Seether's album Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces was to be released soon and speculations started arising to whether it would contain an answer song to [...] "Call Me When You're Sober"; [...] "Breakdown" [...] was initially pinpointed as a possible answer. In response to that, Morgan elaborated that the particular song was not an [...] "angry backlash" [...] and it was [...] "more universal" [...] as he was trying to be [...] "more vague and respectful". Talking about Lee's song, he mentioned how [...] "there are always two sides to every story", yet, he opted not to tell his side as [...] "hat's what the bloodthirsty want, and I don't care what the bloodthirsty want" [...] emphasizing that he [...] "didn't feel the need to write back and be mean". He added that Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces did not contain other answer songs aimed at Lee either, as [...] "I know what the expectations are for this album and that people will be looking for that Amy Lee reference, and I am trying desperately not to have any" [...] further noting how any possible references would be about another relationship he had recently terminated or inspired by other people in his life. Lee expressed [...] "no intention of hurting [...] " [...] during {{an interview}}, but noted that once the song came out without any metaphors, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it.|$|E
