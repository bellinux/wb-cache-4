However, the impact of κ-μ <b>shadowed</b> <b>fading</b> with instantaneous <b>shadowing</b> on performances {{of cellular}} networks is unknown. Therefore, this letter analyzes the downlink coverage probability of a Poisson network with double <b>shadowed</b> <b>fading</b> which is composed of a large-scale fading of lognormal distribution and κ-μ <b>shadowed</b> <b>fading</b> with integer fading parameters. The closest base station association rule without shadowing is considered. For analytical tractability, the double <b>shadowed</b> <b>fading</b> is approximated as a weighted sum of κ-μ shadowed distributions based on the Gaussian-Hermit quadrature. As a main theoretical result, a closed-form expression for the downlink coverage probability of a Poisson network under double <b>shadowed</b> <b>fading</b> for the desired signal and arbitrary fading for the interfering signals is successfully derived.

An important {{quality of service}} (QoS) requirement is that the outage probability of each transmitter/receiver pair is kept below a given level.

30|$|This paper focuses {{mainly on}} the <b>shadow</b> <b>fading</b> modeling. Many channel {{measurements}} have confirmed that the probability density function (PDF) of the <b>shadow</b> <b>fading</b> in logarithmic scale can be approximated by a Gaussian (normal) distribution with zero mean and certain standard deviation [1, 2]. Then in linear scale, this is a lognormal distribution. For this reason, <b>shadow</b> <b>fading</b> is also usually called the lognormal fading. However, measurements have also shown that <b>shadow</b> <b>fading</b> presents both the cross-correlation and the spatial correlation [3 – 7]. Thus, a totally independent one-dimensional lognormal <b>shadow</b> <b>fading</b> fails to well represent the <b>shadow</b> <b>fading</b> for real systems and a two-dimensional (2 D) <b>shadow</b> <b>fading</b> model is preferred. Extensive {{research has been conducted}} on how to accurately model the <b>shadow</b> <b>fading,</b> e.g., how to model the cross-correlation and spatial correlation existing in the realistic <b>shadow</b> <b>fading</b> [3, 4, 7] and how to include them into the 2 D <b>shadow</b> <b>fading</b> models [8 – 12]. For instance, in [3], Saunders et al. proposes a cross-correlation model for the <b>shadow</b> <b>fading.</b> In [7], Gudmundson proposes a spatial correlation model for the <b>shadow</b> <b>fading</b> in mobile radio channels by measurement data fitting. This model now is widely accepted by many researchers and it is almost regarded as a standard spatial correlation model to be included into the proposed 2 D <b>shadow</b> <b>fading</b> models [8 – 12]. However, Gudmundson’s spatial correlation model is proposed mainly for large to moderate cell sizes. For small cell sizes, e.g., Femtocells, it suffers from a low level of accuracy.|$|E
