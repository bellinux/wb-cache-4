25|$|The {{main targets}} of the {{concession}} were to increase <b>service</b> <b>coverage</b> from an initial 46 percent and to reduce water losses from 61 percent. The original target of the concessions was to reach 75 percent <b>service</b> <b>coverage</b> in 2008 and 100 percent {{at the end of}} the concession. They also aimed to reduce water losses to 25 percent by 2008 and 20 percent by the end of the concession. These targets were substantially loosened during the renegotiations: The new 2008 targets were 68 percent for <b>service</b> <b>coverage</b> and 42 percent for water losses. In 2008 <b>service</b> <b>coverage</b> reached only 64 percent and water losses were reduced to only 50 percent. During the same period, water tariffs increased threefold. This increase was partly due to increases in the cost of electricity and bulk water purchases which are passed through by the private companies to the customers.|$|E

25|$|During the 1950s and 1960s {{the water}} and {{sanitation}} sector in the Dominican Republic experienced an abrupt decentralization and subsequent re-centralization. Since 1962, the institutional framework has remained relatively stable, with a gradual process of regionalization to the provinces with the largest cities of the country. In the period since 1980, which was characterized by economic growth fueled primarily by a massive inflow of tourists, substantial investments were made and <b>service</b> <b>coverage</b> increased significantly.|$|E

25|$|During {{the past}} decade, the Mexican water and {{sanitation}} sector made major strides in <b>service</b> <b>coverage</b> with {{water supply and sanitation}} coverage. As shown above, in urban areas 97% of the population is estimated to have access to improved water supply and 85% to adequate sanitation.

This recent tumultuous history, along with a fairly new constitution written in 1985 and then again amended in 1993, can explain a lack of information regarding water and sanitation, as well as low <b>service</b> <b>coverage.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Water Services and Institutional Support Project, a US$30M project {{approved}} in 2007, aims to increase water <b>service</b> <b>coverage</b> {{in the cities}} of Beira, Nampula, Quelimane, and Pemba and to establish an institutional and regulatory framework for water supply in smaller cities and towns. The World Bank was closely involved in the promotion of private sector participation in urban water supply through two projects. The first project (1998–2006) supported building capacity, rural water supply, water resources management, and the preparation of a new urban water supply strategy through a US$36m credit. This strategy, implemented during the second water project (2004–2009), supported large-scale civil works for urban water supply systems in five cities – Maputo (the capital), Beira, Quelimane, Nampula and Pemba through a US$75m credit.|$|E
25|$|According to PALYJA in {{its western}} {{half of the}} {{concession}} the <b>service</b> <b>coverage</b> ratio increased substantially from 34% in 1998 to 59% in 2007 and 65% in 2010. According to data by the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body, access in {{the eastern half of}} the city served by PTJ increased from about 57% in 1998 to about 67% in 2004, but stagnated after that. However, other sources cite much lower access figures for piped water supply to houses, excluding access provided through public hydrants: One study estimated access as low as 25% in 2005, while another source estimates it to be as low as 18.5% in 2011. Those without access to piped water supply get water mostly from wells that are often salty and polluted with bacteria. As of 2017, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Jakarta has a crisis of clean water.|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{correlation}} analysis, generally {{an increase in}} population accessible is associated {{with an increase in}} <b>service</b> area <b>coverage.</b> Nevertheless, population accessibility and <b>service</b> area <b>coverage</b> do not directly imply more number of actual users.

25|$|An Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Program Project {{supported}} by a US$150 million World Bank credit, approved in August 2002, aims at efficient and sustainable water and sanitation services in major urban areas. Their project has three components. The first rehabilitates and expands the {{water supply and sanitation}} infrastructure. The second component supports institutional restructuring and improving managerial capacities of local corporations; and to put in place an appropriate structure for a regulatory body for the urban water and sanitation sector in Yemen. A Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project—with US$20 million approved in December 2000 and additional financing of US$20 million approved in January 2008—aims to expand sustainable rural water supply and sanitation <b>service</b> <b>coverage</b> to mostly poor rural dwellers in ten governorates. Until 2007, 140 water sub-projects serving a population of 320,000 were completed. In addition, three consecutive Social fund for Development Projects financed partly by the World Bank allocated an estimated 15% for rural water supply and sanitation.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{history in}} Buenos Aires urban water {{management}} is notable for its move to privatization {{of the water}} and sanitation systems. Signed in 1992, the Buenos Aires water concession was a unique example of water privatization on a large urban scale for its rapid implementation. The concession handed control of water and sanitation systems to the French company Suez S.A.. Generating controversy for its size, the privatization was successful in that improvements were made to water and <b>service</b> <b>coverage</b> while efficiencies were gained within the water company itself. Additionally, a near 27% reduction in water tariffs quickly followed after the signing of the concession. After a renegotiation of terms in 1997 that generated wide criticism, the concession was canceled in 2006. Water and sewer provisions in the Buenos Aires Metro Area (BAMA) have since been handled by a conglomerate of companies called Water of Greater Buenos Aires (Aguas del Gran Buenos Aires).|$|E
