2500|$|Case-{{hardening}} or <b>surface</b> <b>hardening</b> is {{the process}} of hardening the surface of a metal object while allowing the metal deeper underneath to remain soft, thus forming a thin layer of harder metal (called the [...] "case") at the surface. For iron or steel with low carbon content, which has poor to no hardenability of its own, the case-hardening process involves infusing additional carbon into the surface layer. Case-hardening is usually done after the part has been formed into its final shape, but can also be done to increase the hardening element content of bars to be used in a pattern welding or similar process. The term face hardening is also used to describe this technique, when discussing modern armour.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{case-hardening}} {{is derived}} from the practicalities of the carburization process itself, which is essentially the same as the ancient process. The steel work piece is placed inside a case packed tight with a carbon-based case-hardening compound. This is collectively known as a carburizing pack. The pack is put inside a hot furnace for a variable length of time. Time and temperature determines how deep into the surface the hardening extends. However, the depth of hardening is ultimately limited by the inability of carbon to diffuse deeply into solid steel, and a typical depth of <b>surface</b> <b>hardening</b> with this method is up to 1.5mm. Other techniques are also used in modern carburizing, such as heating in a carbon-rich atmosphere. Small items may be case-hardened by repeated heating with a torch and quenching in a carbon rich medium, such as the commercial products Kasenit / Casenite or [...] "Cherry Red". Older formulations of these compounds contain potentially toxic cyanide compounds, while the more recent types such as Cherry Red do not.|$|E

40|$|Ultrasonic {{surface waves}} are {{suitable}} to characterize <b>surface</b> <b>hardened</b> materials. This is shown at laser hardened turbine blades. The martensitic microstructure within the surface layer of <b>surface</b> <b>hardened</b> steels {{has a lower}} surface wave propagation velocity than the annealed or normalized substrate material. Because the propagation velocity depends on the ratio of layer thickness to wavelength d/A, it allows to determine the hardening depth. If the surface wave frequency is high enough, the surface wave propagates mainly within the hardened layer. A correlation of the surface wave velocity to the surface hardness has been found. Because the variation of the <b>surface</b> velocity in <b>hardened</b> steels is small, a high measuring accuracy is necessary to obtain the interesting hardening parameters with sufficient certainty. Therefore, a measuring arrangement has been developed where laser pulses guided by optical fibres to the <b>surface</b> <b>hardened</b> structure generate simultaneously surface wave impul ses at two different positions. The two ultrasonic impulses are received by a piezoelectric transducer. The surface wave velocity is obtained from the time delay between these impulses which {{is determined by the}} cross-correlation method. To evaluate simultaneously surface waves with different penetration depth from the same signal acquisition. digital filtering has been used in connection with the crosscorrelation...|$|R
40|$|In {{many cases}} of the {{structural}} fracture, it is supposed that metallic fatigue {{is one of the}} important reasons. Many researchers have revealed the fatigue process on the surface of metals. But, in <b>surface</b> <b>hardened</b> steel, internal cracks develop slowly larger before the fracture. So it is needed to detect small inner defects in the machine parts or the working structures, non-destructively. In this paper, a new magnetic sensor (MDK sensor) was used to determine the fatigue process of the nitrided steel (in a <b>surface</b> <b>hardened</b> cylindrical specimen). As experimental results, the small fatigue damage is found out in the midst stage of the fatigue life. This new sensor was supposed to be available to determine the inner defect of metals, as one of NDT methods...|$|R

40|$|According to DIN 50190 the <b>hardening</b> {{depth of}} <b>surface</b> <b>hardened</b> {{components}} {{is defined as}} the distance to surface characterized by a definite value of hardness (f. i. 550 vickers hardness HV).

Micromagnetic testing techniques like the magnetic Barkhausen noise method can be used for a nondestructive determination of hte hardening depth. These techniques are based on the interaction between magnetic domain walls and the microstructure of a ferromagnetic material.

50|$|This ability {{can be used}} in {{hardening}} {{to produce}} parts with varying properties.

50|$|Induction {{hardening}} is a <b>surface</b> <b>hardening</b> {{technique in}} which {{the surface of the}} metal is heated very quickly, using a no-contact method of induction heating.

50|$|A {{widely used}} {{process for the}} <b>surface</b> <b>hardening</b> of steel. The {{components}} are heated {{by means of an}} alternating magnetic field to a temperature within or above the transformation range followed by immediate quenching. The core of the component remains unaffected by the treatment and its physical properties are those of the bar from which it was machined, whilst the hardness of the case can be within the range 37/58 HRC. Carbon and alloy steels with an equivalent carbon content in the range 0.40/0.45% are most suitable for this process.|$|E
50|$|Quench {{hardening}} is {{a mechanical}} {{process in which}} steel and cast iron alloys are strengthened and hardened. These metals consist of ferrous metals and alloys. This is done by heating the material to a certain temperature, depending on the material. This produces a harder material by either <b>surface</b> <b>hardening</b> or through-hardening varying on {{the rate at which}} the material is cooled. The material is then often tempered to reduce the brittleness that may increase from the quench hardening process. Items that may be quenched include gears, shafts, and wear blocks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} paper, the {{suitable}} arrangement of probes to measure case depth of shaft-like materials by using four-point probes method was considered. In the induction hardening process, case depth {{is essential for}} its quality control. It needs great time and labor to measure hardness distribution in the sectional area with cutting the samples. In the previous paper, we have proposed a procedure to evaluate case depth of shaft-like materials by using four-point probes method. This study was aimed at enhancement of sensitivity of evaluation.

From the results, suitable probe arrangement for sensitive evaluation was considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrolytic}} surface-hardening {{method in}} aqueous solution, especially using pulse current, {{has been found}} to be a new development in the area of surface-hardening technologies. Conventional surface heat-treatment processes are carried out at high temperature, hence both the equipment and the operational costs are high. A review of the literature available on heat treatment using direct-current electrolysis was attempted by the authors in a previous publication. This paper briefly introduces the development of this advanced surface heat-treatment technique that can be operated at room temperature, with low cost and easy control, which hence improves its competitiveness. In the investigation reported, a test-piece made of AISI 1050 steel has been <b>surface</b> <b>hardened</b> successfully by electrolysis in aqueous solution. Experimental work and analysis have been carried out in order to study the effect of the average preset voltage on the hardness of the test-piece under both direct-current and pulse-current conditions.

50|$|Early {{last century}} the {{principles}} were explored {{as a means}} to melt steel, and the motor generator was developed to provide the power required for the induction furnace. After general acceptance of the methodology for melting steel, engineers began to explore other possibilities for the utilisation of the process.

5000|$|Induction {{hardening}} is a <b>surface</b> <b>hardening</b> technique {{which uses}} induction coils {{to provide a}} very rapid means of heating the metal. With induction heating, the steel can be heated very quickly to red-hot at the surface, before the heat can penetrate any distance into the metal. The surface is then quenched, hardening it, and is often used without further tempering. This makes the surface very resistant to wear, but provides tougher metal directly underneath it, leaving {{the majority of the}} object unchanged. A common use for induction hardening is for hardening the bearing surfaces, or [...] "journals", on automotive crankshafts or the rods of hydraulic cylinders.|$|E
