A unit (22) inserts the colored test signal into the audio signal, {{to obtain a}} measurement signal. This is <b>supplied</b> <b>to</b> the <b>loudspeaker</b> (10). A calculation and post-processing unit (30, 32) derive the impulse response of the surroundings from a reaction signal received from them by the microphone (12), and the test signal, or its colored version. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the corresponding method. USE - An instrument determining ambient impulse response using a speaker microphone and audio signal. Results are used to correct audio reproduction for an audience e. g. in an auditorium. ADVANTAGE - The method produces a precise impulse response evaluation. The test signal can be inaudible or virtually so, having no effect on, and placing no special demands on, a listener. It may be a white noise signal. Because it is imperceptible, the response can be measured repeatedly, as e. g. an audience grows. Numerous microphones and loudspeakers may be employed during testing, for complete coverage. Using the results, higher audio quality is delivered into the surroundings, e. g. an auditorium...|$|R

As plasma loudspeakers differ greatly fromconventional loudspeakers and have some unique properties that might provide solutions tosound reproduction problems that conventional loudspeakers can not, there may be applicationswhere plasma <b>loudspeakers</b> are favorable <b>to</b> conventional <b>loudspeakers.</b> This literary review willcompare plasma <b>loudspeakers</b> <b>to</b> conventional <b>loudspeakers</b> <b>to</b> reach an understanding of thedifferent technologies and their potential.

It is known that when small loudspeakers are driven at high playback levels the nonlinear characteristics of these speakers become {{a major source of}} sound degradations. Consequently it is essential to find a good model that matches <b>to</b> the <b>loudspeaker</b> response for the purpose of predicting and preventing the nonlinear distortion. This becomes particularly important for the purpose of improving sound quality of mobile phones. This paper presents the loudspeaker operation, the issues of concern, and nonlinear modeling techniques that can reliably be used for its identification process.
