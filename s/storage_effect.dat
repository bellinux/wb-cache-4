25|$|Recent {{work has}} {{extended}} {{what is known}} about the <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> to include apparent competition (i.e., competition mediated through a shared predator).|$|E
25|$|These models {{showed that}} generalist predators can {{undermine}} {{the benefits of}} the <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> that from competition. This occurs because generalist predators depress population levels by eating individuals. When this happens, there are fewer individuals competing for resources. As a result, relatively abundant species are less constrained by competition for resource in favorable years (i.e., the covariance between environment and competition is weakened), and therefore the <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> from competition is weakened. This conclusion follows the general trend that the introduction of a generalist predator will often weaken other competition-based coexistence mechanisms, and which result in competitive exclusion.|$|E
25|$|Power {{capacitors}} can be {{used for}} a wide variety of applications, even where extremely non-sinusoidal voltages and pulsed currents are present. Both AC and DC capacitors are available. AC capacitors serve as damping or snubbing capacitors when connected in series with a resistor, and are also specified for the damping of undesirable voltage spikes caused by the so-called charge carrier <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> during switching of power semiconductors. In addition, AC capacitors are used in low-detuned or close-tuned filter circuits for filtering or absorbing harmonics. As pulse discharge capacitors, they are useful in applications with reversing voltages, such as in magnetizing equipment.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} some {{methods for}} interpretation {{of oil and}} gas well test data distorted by wellbore <b>storage</b> <b>effects.</b> Using these techniques, we can deconvolve pressure and rate data from drawdown and buildup tests dominated by wellbore storage. Some of these methods have the advantage of deconvolving the pressure data without rate measurement. The two important methods that are applied in this study are an explicit deconvolution method and a modification of material balance deconvolution method. In cases with no rate measurements, we use a blind deconvolution method to restore the pressure response free of wellbore <b>storage</b> <b>effects.</b> Our techniques detect the afterflow/unloading rate function with explicit deconvolution of the observed pressure data. The presented techniques can unveil the early time behavior of a reservoir system masked by wellbore <b>storage</b> <b>effects</b> and thus provide powerful tools to improve pressure transient test interpretation. Each method has been validated using both synthetic data and field cases and each method should be considered valid for practical applications...|$|R

25|$|Flood {{flows in}} urban environments have been {{investigated}} relatively recently despite many centuries of flood events. Some researchers mentioned the <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> in urban areas. Several studies looked into the flow patterns and redistribution in streets during storm events and the implication in terms of flood modelling. Some recent research considered the criteria for safe evacuation of individuals in flooded areas. But some recent field measurements during the 2010–2011 Queensland floods showed that any criterion solely based upon the flow velocity, water depth or specific momentum cannot account for the hazards caused by the velocity and water depth fluctuations. These considerations ignore further {{the risks associated with}} large debris entrained by the flow motion.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} (1) covariance between environment and competition, and (2) species-specific {{response to the}} environment decouple the strongest intraspecific and interspecific competition experienced by a species. Intraspecific competition is strongest when a species is favored by the environment, whereas interspecific competition is strongest when its rivals are favored. After this decoupling, buffered population growth limits the impact of interspecific competition when a species is not favored by the environment. As a consequence, the impact of intraspecific competition on the species favored by a particular environment exceeds that of the interspecific competition on species less favored by that environment. We see that the fundamental requirement for species coexistence is fulfilled and thus <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> is able to maintain stable coexistence {{in a community of}} competing species.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> can {{be caused}} by both {{temporal}} and spatial variation. [...] The temporal <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> (often referred to as simply [...] "the storage effect") occurs when species benefit from changes in year-to-year environmental patterns, while the spatial <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> occurs when species benefit from variation in microhabitats across a landscape.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{continuous}} transients {{that are}} abstracted into discontinuous state changes, {{governed by the}} principle of conservation of the extensive state variable, e. g., the displacement, which holdsacross model configuration changes. This principle alleviates the modeling task by built-in bookkeeping of the simulation engine. If there is restitution of energy because of dominant <b>storage</b> <b>effects,</b> further conceptual investment is required to implement instantaneous state changes. These instantaneous changes are represented at the energy level, i. e., in the bond graph, {{in such a manner}} that the tool can handle them directly, and, consequently, enforce conservation constraints. This means that the model designer does not explicitly reset integrator values in the information model part, e. g., by using the action property of a finite state machine. It is shown how transients because of dominant <b>storage</b> <b>effects</b> and because of dominant dissipative effects may interact very differently with other fast continuous transients and how a priori and a posteriori switching values can be used to compute the correct values in case of a sequence of instantaneous changes...|$|R
2500|$|It is {{important}} to note that the <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> is not a model for population growth (such as the LotkaVolterra equation) itself, but is an effect that appears in non-additive models of population growth. [...] Thus, the equations shown below will work for any arbitrary model of population growth, but will only be as accurate as the original model. [...] The derivation below is taken from Chesson 1994. [...] It is a derivation of the temporal <b>storage</b> <b>effect,</b> but is very similar to the spatial <b>storage</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Angert {{and colleagues}} {{demonstrated}} the temporal <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> {{occurring in the}} desert annual plant community on Tumamoc Hill, Arizona. [...] Previous studies had shown the annual plants in that community exhibited a trade-off between growth rate (a proxy for competitive ability) and water use efficiency (a proxy for drought tolerance). [...] As a result, some plants grew better during wet years, while others grew better during dry years. [...] This, combined with variation in germination rates, produced an overall community average <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> of 0.103. [...] In other words, the <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> is expected to help the population of any species at low density to increase, on average, by 10.3% each generation, until it recovers from low density.|$|E
2500|$|For the <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> to operate, it {{requires}} variation (i.e. fluctuations) {{in the environment}} and thus can be termed a [...] "fluctuation-dependent mechanism". [...] This variation can come from a large degree of factors, including resource availability, temperature, and predation levels. [...] However, for the <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> to function, this variation must change the birth, survival, or recruitment rate of species {{from year to year}} (or patch to patch).|$|E

40|$|Oestriol {{concentrations}} in amniotic fluid {{have been investigated}} by several workers as a possible means of assessing foeto-placental function (Berman, Kalchman, Chat-toraj & Scommegna, 1968; Michie & Livingstone, 1969). Certain basic data are re-quired, however, in working with any biological fluid and although information is available for <b>storage</b> <b>effects</b> on urinary oestriol (Leon, Bulbrook & Greenwood, 1959) more information is needed for amniotic fluid. This paper describes {{an investigation of the}} <b>effects</b> of <b>storage</b> at different temperatures, of filtration and of the influence of glucose concentration on amniotic fluid oestriol using a gas-liquid chromatographic(GLC) method. Amniotic fluid was obtained at surgical induction of labour in patients in the 40 th or 41 st weeks of normal pregnancy. For the study of <b>storage</b> <b>effects,</b> 450 ml. of amniotic fluid was obtained from one patient and immediately divided into three parts. The first was stored in a stoppered flask at room temperature (22 =deg,the second in a stoppered flask in the refrigerator at 4 =degṪhe third was divided into 5 ml. aliquots in screw-top containers which were placed in the deep freeze at 16 °.

These types of tests are {{typically}} seen in fall-off testing in which wellbore <b>storage</b> <b>effects</b> mask the complete radial flow regime.

2500|$|The {{first test}} of the spatial <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> was done by Sears and Chesson [...] in the desert area east of Portal, Arizona. [...] Using a common neighbor-removal experiment, they {{examined}} whether coexistence between two annual plants, Erodium cicutarium and Phacelia popeii, {{was due to the}} spatial <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> or resource partitioning. [...] The <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> was quantified in terms of number of inflorescences (a proxy for fitness) instead of actual population growth rate. [...] They found that E. cicutarium was able to outcompete P. popeii in many situations, {{and in the absence of}} the <b>storage</b> <b>effect,</b> would likely competitively exclude P. popeii. [...] However, they found a very strong difference in the covariance between environment and competition, which showed that some of the most favorable areas for P. popeii (the rare species), were unfavorable to E. cicutarium (the common species). [...] This suggests that P. popeii is able to avoid strong interspecific competition in some good patches, and that this may be enough to compensate for losses in areas favorable to E. cicutarium.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> is a {{coexistence}} mechanism {{proposed in}} the ecological theory of species coexistence, which tries to explain how such {{a wide variety of}} similar species are able to coexist within the same ecological community or guild. The <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> was originally {{proposed in the}} 1980s to explain coexistence in diverse communities of coral reef fish, however it has since been generalized to cover a variety of ecological communities. [...] The theory proposes one way for multiple species to coexist: in a changing environment, no species can be the best under all conditions. [...] Instead, each species must have a unique response to varying environmental conditions, and a way of buffering against the effects of bad years. [...] The <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> gets its name because each population [...] "stores" [...] the gains in good years or microhabitats (patches) to help it survive population losses in bad years or patches. [...] One strength of this theory is that, unlike most coexistence mechanisms, the <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> can be measured and quantified, with units of per-capita growth rate (offspring per adult per generation).|$|E
2500|$|The {{first attempt}} made at {{quantifying}} the temporal <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> was by Cáceres in 1997. [...] Using 30 years of water-column data from Oneida Lake, New York, {{she studied the}} effect the <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> had on two species of plankton (Daphnia galeata mendotae and D. pulicaria). [...] These species of plankton lay diapausing eggs which, much like the seeds of annual plants, lay dormant in the sediment for many years before hatching. [...] Cáceres found {{that the size of}} reproductive bouts were fairly uncorrelated between the two species. [...] She also found, {{in the absence of the}} <b>storage</b> <b>effect,</b> D. galeata mendotae would have gone extinct. [...] She was unable to measure certain important parameters (such as the rate of egg predation), but found that her results were robust to a wide range of estimates.|$|E

The model is based on coupling Richard’s equation for variably saturated porous media and a diffusion wave approximation for surface water dynamics. The numerical scheme uses a finite element Richard’s equation solver, FLOW 3 D and a surface DEM-based finite difference module, SURF-ROUTE. Retardation and <b>storage</b> <b>effects</b> due to lakes or depressions are also implemented, to give a complete description of the catchment flow dynamics...|$|R

2500|$|Additionally, {{certain types}} of predators can produce a <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> from predation. [...] This effect has been shown for frequency-dependent predators, who {{are more likely to}} attack prey that are abundant, and for generalist pathogens, who cause {{outbreaks}} when prey are abundant. [...] When prey species are especially numerous and active, frequency-dependent predators become more active, and pathogens outbreaks become more severe (i.e., there was a positive covariance between the environment and predation, analogous to the covariance between the environment and competition). [...] As a result, abundant species are limited during their best years by high predation – an effect that is analogous to the <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> from competition.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{empirical}} {{study that}} tested {{the requirements of}} the <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> was done by Pake and Venable, who looked at three desert annual plants. [...] They experimentally manipulated density and water availability over a two-year period, and found that fitness and germination rates varied greatly from year to year, and over different environmental conditions. [...] This shows that each species has a unique environmental response, and implied that likely there is a covariance between environment and competition. [...] This, combined with the buffered population growth that is a product of a long-lived seed bank, showed that a temporal <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> was probably an important factor in mediating coexistence. [...] This study was also important, because it showed that variation in germination conditions could be a major factor promoting species coexitstence.|$|E

2500|$|For {{species to}} coexist in a community, all species {{must be able}} to recover from low density. Not surprisingly, being a {{coexistence}} mechanism, the <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> helps species when they become rare. It does so by making the abundant species’ effect on itself greater than its effect on the rare species. The difference between species’ response to environmental conditions means that a rare species’ optimal environment {{is not the same as}} its competitors. Under these conditions, the rare species will experience low levels of interspecific competition. [...] Because the rare species itself is rare, it will experience little impact from intraspecific competition as well, even at its highest possible levels of intraspecific competition. Free from the impact of competition, the rare species is able to make gains in these good years or patches. [...] Moreover, thanks to the buffered population growth, the rare species is able to survive the bad years or patches by [...] "storing" [...] the gains from the good years/patches. As a result, the population of any rare species is able to grow due to the <b>storage</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{biological}} {{meaning of}} the <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> is expressed in the mathematical form of ΔI.

2500|$|The <b>storage</b> <b>effect</b> mixes three {{essential}} {{ingredients to}} assemble a community of competing species that fulfill the requirement. They are 1) correlation between the quality of an environment {{and the amount of}} competition experienced by a population in that environment (i.e. covariance between environment and competition), 2) differences in species response to the same environment (i.e. species-specific environmental responses), and 3) the ability of a population to diminish the impact of competition under worsening environment (i.e. buffered population growth). [...] Each ingredient is described in detail below with an explanation why the combination of the three leads to species coexistence.|$|E
