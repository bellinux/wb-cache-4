25|$|Like young {{children}} most of Genie's first words were monosyllabic consonant-vowel-(consonant) sequences, usually consisting of an unaspirated Bilabial stop or dental stop and a monophthong. But while most children's first disyllabic words also follow this pattern, hers had both consonant-vowel and vowel-consonant sequences. Unusually, {{from the very}} first disyllabic words Genie more fully articulated, except when referring to herself by her (real) name she immediately demonstrated proper stress patterns. For approximately two years the length of time she held out a vowel was her only stress indicator, and during that time was very exaggerated. People unfamiliar with her speech said <b>she</b> <b>sounded</b> either like a deaf child or someone with cerebral palsy, although trained speech pathologists only said the latter.|$|E

[...] Futterman called her performance [...] "mostly spot-on", and TVLine Michael Slezak pointed out: [...] "Why is it that every time Tina sings—remember her sobbing [...] "My Funny Valentine"—things end weirdly? I wish we'd gotten a little more vocal and a little less booing in an episode about the club's underappreciated talents."

Moss asserted that the No Doubt lead vocalist was the [...] "most captivating thing onstage" [...] with her [...] "confident strut and dead-on vocals". Jon Pareles of The New York Times admired the [...] "glamour and groove" [...] antics of the show and how Stefani [...] "flaunt the perks of stardom". He praised her music, describing the album as [...] "a smart , with honed rhythm tracks that flit from funk to pop, electronics to rock", although calling most tracks [...] "superficial", being about [...] "style", [...] "success", [...] "shopping" [...] and [...] "sex".|$|E

Clarkson told People that one of her favourite moments on television was performing [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] at the MTV Video Music Awards, saying [...] "I hate being all dressed up, so the fact that I was soaking wet with mascara smeared all over my face was definitely the highlight of my evening!" [...] Becky Bain of Idolator thought that the performance was Clarkson's most memorable live performances while Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times thought Clarkson's performance was very solid despite the feeling that <b>she</b> <b>sounded</b> better dry than drenched.

500|$|PopMatters writer Devone Jones {{described}} the song as [...] "the most energetic track" [...] on the album, {{and continued to}} write that the [...] "skillful" [...] lyrics allow Carey to perform [...] "genuine harmonies" [...] which are reminiscent of seventies dance songs. [...] Both Andy Kellman of AllMusic and Eric Henderson for Slant Magazine noted that Carey appeared to be channeling American dance singer Jocelyn Brown, with the former writer that <b>she</b> <b>sounded</b> like Brown more prominently in the intro, while the latter described [...] "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] as a [...] "stunning" [...] tribute to Brown's 1984 single [...] "Somebody Else's Guy".

500|$|Director Chris Buck {{believed}} that Menzel's vocals would {{help in the}} portrayal of the character, saying, [...] "Idina {{has a sense of}} vulnerability in her voice. She plays a very strong character, but someone who lives in fear—so we needed someone who could portray both sides of the character, and Idina was just amazing." [...] Menzel was unaccustomed to working with animated films and being required to portray her character's feelings with her voice alone, though she did not find it particularly challenging. While recording, she was able to [...] "play" [...] with her voice, trying various tones to establish the ranges in Elsa's emotions. For example, Menzel wanted there to be a difference between the ways <b>she</b> <b>sounded</b> when she was being bold and when she was angry. She would also physically restrict her hands from moving as she recorded the film's early scenes in order to project how her character was [...] "so afraid to move and feel anything that it would come out and hurt people".|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Melinda Newman of HitFix {{said it was}} [...] "a bit snoozy", however complemented Twain's reasonably strong vocals. Newman added, [...] "She’s not pushing or belting in any way, but she’s upfront and center. However, her delivery is hardly the peppy rallying call that the lyrics call for and if a song ever demanded to be uptempo, this would be it." [...] Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times called the song [...] "a shocking stinkeroo every which way." [...] Daly criticized Twain's vocal delivery, noting <b>she</b> <b>sounded</b> as though she sang through {{the side of her}} mouth much like James Cagney, and said the track reinforced the skeptics who insisted Lange was the reason for Twain's success. He concluded, [...] "If 'Today Is Your Day' is a sign of things to come, you might want to hold your breath on that comeback." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV was disappointed with [...] "Today Is Your Day", but said she would [...] "take it" [...] following the singer's long absence from music. Rubenstein commented that the song was undoubtedly saccharine, yet Twain's lush and rich voice prevailed.|$|E

Then, on December 5, 2012, during the same show, Carly Rose Sonenclar also covered the song. Jennifer Still of Digital Spy noted that <b>she</b> <b>sounded</b> [...] "effortless on those long, belting notes and shows a lot of {{restraint}} in the verses as well". On August 18, 2013, during the fifth season of The X Factor Australia, Dami Im covered the song during the home visits round.

500|$|After {{having a}} {{potential}} contract with Apollo Records collapse when the label went bankrupt, Biondo and Dale {{decided that she}} should release her own live album. On January 2–3, 1996, the material for Live at Blues Alley was recorded at Blues Alley in Washington, DC. Due to a technical glitch {{on the first night}} of recording, only the second night's recording was usable. (The recording of the first night was eventually restored and released as Nightbird in 2015.) Unhappy with the way <b>she</b> <b>sounded</b> due to a cold, she was reluctant to release the album. She eventually relented, on the condition that the studio track [...] "Oh, Had I a Golden Thread", Cassidy's favorite song, would be included in the release, and that they start working on a follow-up studio album. Her apprehension appeared unfounded as local reviewers and the public responded positively. The Washington Post commented that [...] "she could sing anything— folk, blues, pop, jazz, R, gospel— and make it sound like it was the only music that mattered." [...] The subsequent studio album she worked on was released posthumously as Eva by Heart in 1997. In the liner notes of Eva by Heart, music critic Joel E.

500|$|... "Dirty Picture" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Taio Cruz, {{in collaboration with}} Fraser T Smith. While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and {{he was telling me}} about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' or anything like that at that point. But I just thought <b>she</b> <b>sounded</b> really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — I hope she won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely quality to it, the way that she does things and the way that she ends words. I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Since U Been Gone" [...] {{has also}} been covered by contestants from reality {{television}} singing competitions. The song was performed by Todrick Hall on the eighth season of American Idol. Despite fulfilling the judges' desire to hear something original, his rendition of the song drew criticism from the judges, with Simon Cowell commenting that Hall seemed like a dancer trying to sing. On November 26, 2011, Amelia Lily performed the song on the eighth series of The X Factor UK. Her rendition was praised by the judges; Louis Walsh felt that her performance was effortless while Kelly Rowland remarked that [...] "Amelia Lily hits those notes in her sleep!" [...] The song was also covered by Luke O'Dell on the third season of The X Factor Australia. On June 13, 2012, John Legend and his duet partner, Meleana Brown, covered [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] in Duets.

Casper Llewellyn Smith from The Daily Telegraph felt that with the performance of the song, the Drowned World show [...] "picked up pace." [...] In a review in Los Angeles Times, critic Greg Kot said that the [...] "ballistic" [...] response of the audience to the performance of [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] and another song [...] "Candy Perfume Girl" [...] confirmed the crowd's satisfaction regarding the show. A similar review was given by Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani, who described the performance as a [...] "virulent and possessive dance routine", and felt it {{set the tone for the}} whole show. Alex Needham from NME compared the performance with those by The Royal Ballet, suggesting that if the group performed in rubber-fetish, they would be similar to Madonna's theatrics. Todd Ramlow from PopMatters criticized Madonna's vocals during the performance, saying that <b>she</b> <b>sounded</b> flat during the lower notes of the song. The electronic effects used in the song was received negatively by Ramlow, who felt that Madonna should have opted for the addition of backing vocalists. The performance of the song on August 26, 2001, at The Palace of Auburn Hills, outside of Madonna's hometown of Detroit was recorded and released in the live video album, Drowned World Tour 2001 on November 13, 2001.|$|E

500|$|Fi {{was created}} before the {{implantation}} of Wii MotionPlus, {{when she was}} going to be part of some different undefined gameplay concepts unrelated to motion control. Her design was based on the design of the Master Sword, referencing her origins as the sword's spirit. [...] She also served as an alternative explanatory voice as Link was a silent protagonist. According to staff, Fi's technical dialogue for each area of the game was written by different people, verbal inconsistencies arose that needed addressing, so Fujibayashi adjusted them all so <b>she</b> <b>sounded</b> consistent. Nearly all of Fi's dialogue was ultimately written by Fujibayashi. Ghirahim was designed to be similar to the Dark Link character from Ocarina of Time: he could read Link's movements, requiring players to think strategically to defeat him rather than simply swinging Link's sword around randomly. Character designs were far more detailed than in previous Zelda titles. Clothing was frequently designed to complement backgrounds, such as Zelda's pink and red dress in the opening. The game's use of warm colors and brushstroke-like aesthetics was inspired by impressionist artwork, pioneered in the 19th century by painters such as Claude Monet: a particular element cited by Miyamoto was the sky, which he called a tribute to the work of Paul Cézanne. The basic starting point for the art style was the fact of it being a fantasy world. The final version was referred to as a balance between the more overt cartoon styling of [...] and Twilight Princess, where the cartoon shading was transferred onto an older version of Link. The team settled this artstyle as it would properly portray the more exaggerated actions of some characters and general swordplay while preserving Link's mature appearance.|$|E
500|$|Songwriter Stephen Schwartz had {{originally}} been slated to write both the music and lyrics for Mulan until he ultimately left the project to write songs for rival studio DreamWorks' animated film The Prince of Egypt (1998) instead after Disney executives forced him {{to choose between the}} two. Schwartz had completed only two songs for Mulan before his resignation, one of which was entitled [...] "China Doll" [...] which, according to Schwartz, [...] "more or less corresponds to the scene in the film in which Mulan goes to the Matchmaker". Schwartz was eventually replaced with composer Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel, who wrote [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] with which to replace Schwartz's [...] "China Doll". Disney cast American singer and actress Marni Nixon, one of Hollywood's most prolific playback singers, as the singing voice of Grandmother Fa, Mulan's paternal grandmother. Nixon received the sheet music for [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] to review prior to auditioning for the role. The filmmakers then showed Nixon a drawing of the character, by whose comedic appearance the singer was immediately [...] "enchanted", telling herself [...] "you've just got to give her a voice... or, in this case, an unvoice." [...] Improvising her performance, Nixon decided to make the character sound as though she was merely attempting to sing as opposed to actually singing, keeping in mind that the elderly character is toothless. Nixon also made no effort to sound like the actress who had been cast as Grandmother Fa's speaking voice at the time, determining that the two performers sound nothing alike upon listening to the actress' recording. Nixon had almost reconsidered auditioning for the role upon realizing how different <b>she</b> <b>sounded</b> from Grandmother Fa's speaking voice actress.|$|E

He also reported that she was planning to tour House of Blues venues in the United States. Spears wanted to keep the rehearsals a secret, and did not even inform the owners of the different dance studios the reason for the preparation. In late April 2007, a marquee reading [...] "The M+M's" [...] appeared at the House of Blues in San Diego. Several gossip websites and local media sources identified the act as Spears, prompting the show to quickly sell out. The title, [...] "M+M's" [...] code name was claimed to be Mother (after having two children) and Miss (after being divorced). On May 1, 2007, a front-page story on The San Diego Union-Tribune fueled the speculation. The same day, the doors opened at 19:00 PST (03:00 UTC), and Spears took the stage at 22:00 PST (06:00 UTC).
