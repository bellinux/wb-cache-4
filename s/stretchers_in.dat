25|$|The NH90 {{featured}} {{an advanced}} composite airframe, designed for ballistic tolerance, {{a high level}} of crashworthiness, lower weight, and 30 per cent greater endurance than a metallic counterpart. The four main rotor blades are also composed of composite materials, increasing fatigue strength and lifespan while providing for greater damage tolerance. The unobstructed main cabin area is entered either by large sliding doors {{on either side of the}} fuselage or via a rear ramp, the cabin is designed to accommodate modular equipment packages to enable the rotorcraft to be rapidly reconfigured, providing for operational flexibility. In a troop-transport capacity, the cabin can accommodate up to 20 fully equipped soldiers, or up to 12 <b>stretchers</b> <b>in</b> a medical evacuation role, some light vehicles may also be transported; the main cabin is equipped with environmental control systems and sound proofing measures to improve passenger conditions.|$|E
2500|$|As Myola was {{threatened}} by the Japanese advance, the casualties gathered {{there had to be}} evacuated {{to the head of the}} track. The report of then Colonel Norris, the 7th Division's senior medical officer, noted the difficulty of providing sufficient means to move stretchers. Each required eight bearers which meant those wounded who were able to stagger were treated with [...] "absolute ruthlessness" [...] and not provided with <b>stretchers.</b> <b>In</b> one case, a casualty with a severely fractured patella (kneecap) walked for six days and some with worse injuries volunteered to walk to free a stretcher for the more seriously wounded.|$|E

[...] "Anyone who tries {{to cross the border}} will be killed," [...] Israeli soldiers warned through megaphones as people waving Palestinian flags streamed towards the frontier. When protesters tried to cut the razor wire several meters short of the frontier fence, Israeli troops opened fire. Several people were seen being carried away on <b>stretchers.</b> <b>In</b> the aftermath, thousands began a sit-in near the frontier, resulting in Syrian security forces creating a security buffer zone to prevent more demonstrators from approaching the border. Lebanese President Michel Sleiman accused Israel of genocide over the incident, UN High Commissioner on Human Rights Navanethem Pillay condemned the Israel Defense Forces' use of force against unarmed, civilian protesters, and the Syrian Social Nationalist Party called for an international response to the incident, calling it a [...] "massacre". An Israeli military spokeswoman called the violence [...] "an attempt to divert international attention from the bloodbath going on in Syria." [...] Michael Weiss, a spokesperson for Just Journalism, claimed that he had received leaked Syrian state documents showing that the Syrian government organized the Nakba Day protests to draw attention away from the uprising in Syria proper. US State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the U.S. believes President Bashar Assad's government was actively supporting the Palestinian protests near the Israeli border.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{match of}} the evening saw the rudo (someone who plays the [...] "bad guy") team of Apocalipsis and Inquisidor defeat the tecnico (someone who plays the [...] "good guy") team of Bengala and Leono two falls to one. The second match of the night {{featured}} CMLL's Mini-Estrella division as then CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion Pequeño Olímpico teamed up with fellow Rudos and Pequeño Nitro to take on Astral, Pequeño Halcon and Último Dragóncito. The two teams each took a fall, forcing {{them to go to}} the third and deciding fall of the match, during which both Último Dragóncito and Astral were hurt after taking a move from Demus 3:16 and Pequeño Halcon had to work the closing moments of the match alone, losing in quick fashin. After the match the seemingly hurt Mini Luchadors had to be taken from the ring on <b>stretchers.</b> <b>In</b> the third fall the outcome of the match itself, the team of Guerrero Maya Jr., Rey Cometa and Stuka Jr. defeated Misterioso Jr., Niebla Roja and Puma King, was less important than the actions after the match. Both Rey Cometa and Puma King spoke at length about their problems with each other, finally agreeing to a Luchas de Apuestas [...] "Mask vs. mask" [...] between the two for the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show.
