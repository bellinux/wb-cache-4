25|$|Thus, {{although}} the Erie decision {{itself does not}} identify <b>specific</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Constitution violated by Swift, {{the language of the}} decision implies that Swift had stolen powers reserved to the states, in violation of the Tenth Amendment. Justice Brandeis also noted problems for equal protection of the laws, but the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to states, and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause was not read to include an equal protection component until the 1954 decision in Bolling v. Sharpe.|$|E
25|$|The prime statute {{regulating}} bus {{services in}} Victoria is the Transport Integration Act 2010. The Act established the Department of Transport as the integration agency for Victoria's transport system. The Act also established {{and set the}} charters of the state agencies charged with providing public transport services, including buses. The now-defunct Director of Public Transport was empowered by the Act to enter into contracts with operators {{for the provision of}} bus and other public transport services. That function was taken over by Public Transport Victoria in 2012. <b>Specific</b> <b>provisions</b> relating to the contracting regime for buses in Victoria are set out in the Bus Services Act 1995.|$|E

500|$|Judge Xie Xue {{told reporters}} that forced {{abortion}} would not be classified as homicide or kidnapping, but could qualify as an intentional injury crime. [...] In cases where complications arose after the abortion, such as Feng's, the injury {{could be considered a}} serious offense bearing a possible penalty of three to ten years in prison. [...] However, The Wall Street Journal said a legal remedy was unlikely, noting that a 2008 decision by the Supreme People's Court indicated that litigation could not be based on <b>specific</b> <b>provisions</b> of the constitution. [...] Furthermore, family planning law does not have any provision for damages awarded to victims of abuse by government officials.|$|E

30|$|The most {{important}} thing to notice here is that SDG-Pro provides software-defined gateway <b>specific</b> <b>provisioning</b> APIs. This shows that our abstractions are designed in such manner to inherently support programmatic provisioning, by exposing well-defined API and providing runtime mechanisms which transparently enable inversion of control and late (re)binding of the dependencies. Also standard provisioning operations such as fetching a remote resource can be combined with <b>specific</b> <b>provisioning</b> APIs, as shown in lines 7 – 9. The {{most important}} consequence is that developers can design generic application business logic and transparently declare the desired infrastructure dependencies programmatically, e.g., in a separate application module.|$|R
50|$|A <b>specific</b> <b>provision</b> in the Media Act limits {{ownership}} concentration {{with regard to}} press outlets only: it is limited to media outlets whose market share in terms of total sold copies exceeds 40 percent.|$|R
500|$|Similarly, the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB) was a five-member {{committee}} {{established by}} the McCarran Internal Security Act in 1950, which had a mandate, similar to HUAC and inspired by McCarthy, to locate and investigate so-called [...] "subversives", or those sympathetic to the Communists. They were accused of promoting {{the establishment of a}} [...] "totalitarian dictatorship" [...] in the United States. President Truman vetoed the act, sending Congress a lengthy veto message in which he criticized <b>specific</b> <b>provisions</b> as [...] "the greatest danger to freedom of speech, press, and assembly since the Alien and Sedition Laws of 1798," [...] and called it a [...] "mockery of the Bill of Rights" [...] and a [...] "long step toward totalitarianism"; his veto was overridden. SACB was active for 18 years (1950-1968), but the Supreme Court did not rule all sections of the law were unconstitutional until 1993.|$|E

2500|$|The new {{legislative}} framework was defined by Law 10,848/2004, which established clear, stable and transparent rules aimed at ensuring supply and the continuous expansions of the intrinsic sector activities (generation, transmission and distribution). The expansion was linked to a fair return on investments and to universal service access, together with tariff adjustments. Decree 5,081/2004 approved the regulatory framework for the power sector, specifying <b>specific</b> <b>provisions</b> to achieve {{the objectives of the}} reform.|$|E
50|$|Importantly, {{there is}} {{commonly}} a legal requirement for organizations {{to communicate with}} their workers. In Europe, for example, the EU has made very <b>specific</b> <b>provision</b> about workers' rights to be informed and consulted with Directive 94/45/EC (Works Council).|$|R

2500|$|Under {{the terms}} of the peace treaty, Canadiens who did not choose to leave became British subjects. In order for them to serve in public offices, they were {{required}} to swear an oath to the King that contained <b>specific</b> <b>provisions</b> rejecting the Catholic faith.
