40|$|ABSTRACT. Studies {{of surface}} water and shallow {{groundwater}} hydrology require intensive replicated measurements of water levels, preferably in computer–ready digital form. Commercial digital stage recorders are expensive, which prompted {{the design and}} construction of an inexpensive, automatic, digital canal <b>stage</b> <b>recorder</b> with off–the–shelf materials. This device fits into a PVC pipe used as a stilling well, making a sturdy design and very simple installation and maintenance. Step–by–step instructions on the recorder construction are presented as well as design considerations to fit a particular application. The field performance of the <b>stage</b> <b>recorder</b> was assessed in a canal in South Florida. Continuous water level readings were compared with those readings obtained at a stage recording station maintained by the South Florida Water Management District. Results obtained during the experimental period of 4. 5 months showed good agreement between these two instruments (R 21 : 1 = 0. 996 and y = 0. 9524 x + 0. 048; R 2 = 0. 998) and a measurement resolution of 0. 63 cm when using an 8 –bit data logger. The simple canal <b>stage</b> <b>recorder</b> could be adapted for measuring water levels in shallow wells, lakes, and tidal lagoons...|$|E

The design presented in their paper is to be commended, particularly their adaptation of the data logger to allow resistance measurement {{without the need for}} an excita-tion channel. It may be appropriate to comment here on in-stallation and maintenance conditions recommended to im-prove the accuracy of such a device under field conditions over longer time periods than is presented in their paper (May-September field season).

40|$|Groundwater {{level at}} the {{vicinity}} of the lower reaches of the Asake River, a typical influent stream in the Hokusei District, was investigated through the use of <b>stage</b> <b>recorders.</b> A water table of phreatic groundwater was significantly affected by precipitation. There was a peak of the artesian head of confined groundwater in winter, and the minimum lay in summer. It is considered that a withdrawal has direct effects upon the groundwater level.

40|$|Following initial habitat {{assessments}} and literature reviews, the Pacific Salmon Foundation identified further flow {{and water quality}} monitoring as a priority under the Englishman River Watershed Recovery Plan. In 2002, Lough and Morley determined reduced summer flow was limiting to fish production and northwest hydraulic consultants identified potential loss of Englishman River surface water through groundwater seepage. Discharge was monitored in the mainstem and Morison Creek with semi-permanent <b>stage</b> <b>recorders</b> and flow metering. Fish habitat suitability was measured as discharge decreased through the low water period by conducting depth/velocity transects, measuring wetted width, and photographing habitat. Results confirmed mainstem discharge dropped below the minimum threshold of the current Provisional Operation Rule for Arrowsmith Dam fisheries flow releases. Loss of flow by groundwater seepage appeared insignificant, but results were inconsistent. Habitat suitability monitoring reconfirmed ideal base summer flow would be near 20 % o...|$|R
40|$|Water quality {{regulation}} and litigation have elevated the awareness {{and need for}} quantifying water quality and source contributions in watersheds across the USA. In the present study, the regression method, which is typically applied to large (perennial) rivers, was evaluated {{in its ability to}} estimate constituent loads (NO 3 –N, total N, PO 4 –P, total P, sediment) on three small (ephemeral) watersheds with diff erent land uses in Texas. Specifi cally, regression methodology was applied with daily fl ow data collected with bubbler <b>stage</b> <b>recorders</b> in hydraulic structures and with water quality data collected with four low-frequency sampling strategies: random, rise and fall, peak, and single stage. Estimated loads were compared with measured loads determined in 2001 – 2004 with an autosampler and high-frequency sampling strategies. Although annual rainfall and runoff volumes were relatively consistent within watersheds during the study period, measured annual nutrient and sedimen...|$|R
40|$|Complete inflow hydrographs for inflow {{events to}} {{reservoirs}} cannot be determined from <b>stage</b> <b>recorder</b> records alone, unless seepage losses from the reservoir are known. Determination {{of the actual}} magnitude of the hydrograph and duration of the inflow recession requires knowledge of the changes of seepage rates with surface head in the reservoirs. This thesis develops three independent methods of determining seepage under saturated flow conditions from <b>stage</b> <b>recorder</b> and pan evaporation records: the application of Darcy's Law; the application of extrapolated curves of storage decline versus pan evaporation to zero pan evaporation; {{and the application of}} a three dimensional regression model. It is felt that the Darcy method produces the most accurate results, and that the extrapolation method produces the least accurate results. The extrapolation method requires several averaging methods contributing to its inaccuracy. The seepage rates obtained on Tank 2, Atterbury watershed ranged from 1. 5 x l 0 ^- 4 cfs for two feet of surface head and a reservoir capacity of 0. 60 acre-feet to approximately 1. 5 cfs for nine foet of surface head and a reservoir capacity of 22 acre-feet. The application of the seepage curve derived by the Darcy method produced a summer inflow hydrograph recession of three and one-half hours, and a winter inflow hydrograph recession of four and one-half hours, as compared with durations of two and one-half and four hours respectively for the uncorrected summer and winter hydrographs...|$|E

The direct runoff which was estimated from the observed runoff data after deducting the baseflow was used to evaluate the Ф-index. The effective rainfall intensity was computed using this Ф-index.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} hillslope runoff and {{sediment}} transport within two catchments in southeast Spain. Five monitoring sites were established on hillslope concavities throughout the two catchments. The techniques used were mini-crest <b>stage</b> <b>recorders,</b> spray-painted lines, sediment traps and tipping bucket rain gauges (established during previous research). Results {{show that a}} storm event in the Rambla Nogalte on 30 June 2002 of 83. 0 mm was responsible for a maximum runoff depth of 12 cm and a maximum hillslope sediment transport of 1886 cm 3 m− 1. The same storm in the Rambla de Torrealvilla produced 53. 4 mm of rainfall on the 1 July 2002, had a maximum runoff depth of 26 cm and resulted in 2311 cm 3 m− 1 of sediment transport. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} measured sediment transport is related to runoff and a qualitative estimate of Morphological Runoff Zones (MRZ). Sediment transport and depth of runoff varied dramatically with lithology; marl sites produced most runoff and sediment transport, followed by the sites of mixed red and blue schist, then blue schist. These results are important for understanding the behaviour of slopes and show that for short lived storms with high, but not rare, rainfall intensities and total rainfall amounts, runoff can cause significant hillslope sediment transport in semi-arid areas...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{conducted}} during Phase I of the "Flood Hydrology and Urban Water Resources of the Island of Oahu, Hawaii" project {{were divided into}} four major tasks. The first is {{an examination of the}} causes of flooding and flood damages on Oahu. This task has been completed and data obtained reveals that historical floods in Oahu happened most frequently within the city limits of Honolulu and the Waialua area. The second task was to evaluate the effect of urbanization upon flood hydrographs from selected watersheds in Oahu. The third task was to establish the rainfall-runoff data collection devices in the adjoined urban (St. Louis Heights) and natural (Waahila) watersheds. 	The installation and operation of two auto-recording raingages and two auto-recording water <b>stage</b> <b>recorders</b> were completed. The fourth task was to initiate the studies of watershed simulation models. Thus far, efforts have been concentrated on two watershed simulation models. 	One model utilizes an auto-optimal technique in determining the instantaneous unit hydrograph. The other model is a modification of the Kentucky Watershed Model to better fit Hawaiian conditions. Additional modifications are required before a good fit is achieved by both models.

40|$|Proceedings of the 2007 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 27 - 29, 2007, Athens, Georgia. The Piedmont {{region in}} the United States has been eroded and gullied due to {{deforestation}} and cultivation during the 1700 and 1800. Currently, a majority of these gullies are under forest vegetation and appear stable; however, neither the hydrology of these gullies, nor their sediment contribution to surface waters, has been quantified. This study instrumented eight gullies {{ranging in size from}} 36 - 90 m long, 2. 4 to 9. 5 m wide, and 0. 9 to 3. 0 m deep with weirs, <b>stage</b> <b>recorders,</b> and stormwater samplers to assess gully response to prescribed burning. Results from pre-burn data show that only four out of the eight gullies exhibit flow during storm events ranging up to 25. 7 mm. Higher rainfall amounts, such as those achieved during hurricanes, may be needed to initiate flow in all gullies. This observation has implications for understanding gully re-activation and associated erosion. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{soft water}} level sensor is proposed to characterize the hydrological behaviour of agricultural catchments by measuring rainfall and stream flows. This sensor works as a capacitor coupled with a capacitance to frequency converter and measures water level at an adjustable time step acquisition. It {{was designed to be}} handy, minimally invasive and optimized in terms of energy consumption and low-cost fabrication so as to multiply its use on several catchments under natural conditions. It was used as a <b>stage</b> <b>recorder</b> to measure water level dynamics in a channel during a runoff event and as a rain gauge to measure rainfall amount and intensity. Based on the Manning equation, a method allowed estimation of water discharge with a given uncertainty and hence runoff volume at an event or annual scale. The sensor was tested under controlled conditions in the laboratory and under real conditions in the field. Comparisons of the sensor to reference devices (tipping bucket rain gauge, hydrostatic pressure transmitter limnimeter, Venturi channels) showed accurate results: rainfall intensities and dynamic responses were accurately reproduced and discharges were estimated with an uncertainty usually acceptable in hydrology. Hence, it was used to monitor eleven small agricultural catchments located in the Mediterranean region. Both catchment reactivity and water budget have been calculated. Dynamic response of the catchments has been studied at the event scale through the rising time determination and at the annual scale by calculating the frequency of occurrence of runoff events. It provided significant insight into catchment hydrological behaviour which could be useful for agricultural management perspectives involving pollutant transport, flooding event and global water balance...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogeomorphic {{processes}} influencing alluvial {{gully erosion}} were evaluated at multiple {{spatial and temporal}} scales across the Mitchell River fluvial megafan in tropical Queensland, Australia. Longitudinal changes in floodplain inundation were quantified using river gauge data, local <b>stage</b> <b>recorders</b> and HEC-RAS modelling based on LiDAR topographic data. Intra- and interannual gully scarp retreat rates were measured using daily time-lapse photographs and annual GPS surveys. Erosion was analysed in response to different water sources and associated erosion processes across the floodplain perirheic zone, including direct rainfall, infiltration-excess runoff, soil-water seepage, river backwater and overbank flood inundation. The frequency of river flood inundation of alluvial gullies changed longitudinally according to river incision and confinement. Near {{the top of the}} megafan, flood water was contained within the macrochannel up to the 100 -year recurrence interval, but river backwater still partially inundated adjacent gullies eroding into Pleistocene alluvium. In downstream Holocene floodplains, inundation of alluvial gullies occurred beyond the 2 - to 5 -year recurrence interval and contributed significantly to total annual erosion. However, most gully scarp retreat at all sites was driven by direct rainfall and infiltration-excess runoff, with the 24 -h rainfall total being the most predictive variable. The remaining variability can be explained by seasonal vegetative conditions, complex cycles of soil wetting and drying, tension crack development, near-surface pore-water pressure, soil block undermining from spalling and overland flow, and soil property heterogeneity. Implications for grazing management impacts on soil surface and perennial grass conditions include effects on direct rainfall erosion, water infiltration, runoff volume, water concentration along tracks, and the resistance of highly dispersible soils to gully initiation or propagation under intense tropical rainfall.

40|$|Headwater systems often {{comprise}} alluvial rivers {{interrupted by}} reaches with {{partly or entirely}} rock beds, indicate a local change in bedload conveyance relative to sediment supply. Detailed knowledge of sediment dynamics in bedrock-alluvial systems is crucial for {{a better understanding of}} bedrock incision and sediment delivery downstream, but field evidence is lacking. This thesis reports a field investigation in this topic. Coarse bedload transport was studied in alluvial, semi-alluvial and bare rock segments of Trout Beck in North England by monitoring two sets of 270 magnet-tagged pebbles over a period of nineteen months. At-a-station hydraulic geometry, flow resistance and shear stress were estimated using <b>stage</b> <b>recorders,</b> water surface profiles and salt-wave measurements in five short sub-reaches. Thresholds of motion were investigated using tracer-pebble data and bedload impact counts. Tracers seeded in the upstream alluvial channel moved more slowly. Tracers seeded in a bare rock gorge dispersed quickly at first but accumulated in a coarse-sediment zone {{at the start of the}} next partial cover. Bedload transport was size selective over alluvial or semi-alluvial segments but not over bare rock. Flow resistance, as quantified by Manning’s n or Darcy-Weisbach f, varies considerably with both discharge and bed character. The estimated bedload conveyance is highest in reaches with entirely or mainly rock bed, and lowest in alluvial and boulder-rich segments. The boulder-rich segment has high shear stress, but presumably its threshold stress is also high due to form drag from boulders, as evidenced by very high values of n and f. No standard resistance law describes flow in Trout Beck accurately from measured bed D 84.

Watershed scale {{knowledge of how}} culvert runoff response varies across the landscape would provide valuable information to those individuals designing and maintaining forest road systems. In order {{to better understand the}} hydrologic interactions of the hillslope and the road, this study focused on all cross drain culverts in a 3 rd order watershed of Oak Creek located in the McDonald/Dunn Research Forest 3 miles west of Corvallis Oregon. <b>Stage</b> <b>recorders</b> measured runoff response for winter months from October to March 2001 to 2002 and data for the January 25, 2002 storm event were analyzed in detail. Instantaneous peak discharge was measured at all culverts with either a crest gauge or a capacitance rod. Those culverts with a capacitance rod measured water height data every 10 minutes and provided a runoff response hydrograph. Fifty-eight of 74 gauged road segments were used in the analysis. Measurable instantaneous peak discharge was received from all 58 cross drain culverts and total runoff volumes were measured at 40 of the road segments. Frequency distributions of the runoff response for both instantaneous peak discharge and total runoff volume follow a right skew distribution. This indicates {{that a majority of the}} culverts measured had lower amounts of runoff than the mean and that only a small fraction of the culverts had a large runoff response. Geographic Information System (GIS) coverage for McDonald/Dunn Forest was used to calculate road and hillslope characteristics.

The objective {{of this research was}} to compare differences in nitrate-nitrogen (NO 3 -N) and atrazine concentrations and discharges in streamflow from two watersheds in the Midwest for a 10 -year period, 1992 through 2001. One watershed was the 7, 280 -ha Goodwater Creek watershed located in north-central Missouri, the other, the 5, 130 -ha Walnut Creek watershed in central Iowa. The Goodwater Creek watershed is located in the Central Claypan Major Land Resource Area (MLRA 113). Soils within this watershed are poorly drained because of a subsurface horizon 150 to 300 mm deep that has a clay content greater than 50 %. The Walnut Creek watershed is located in the Central Iowa and Minnesota Till Prairies Major Land Resource Area (MLRA 103). Many of the soils within this watershed are tile drained to increase productivity. Over 80 % of the area within each watershed is cropped, but the fraction of corn cropping is higher in the Walnut Creek watershed. The drainage outlet of each watershed is instrumented with a concrete v-notch weir, water <b>stage</b> <b>recorder,</b> and refrigerated automatic pumping sampler. During low stages of streamflow, grab samples of baseflow were collected at the weir for chemical analyses.

Objectives of this study were to determine if herbicides used for brush control influence: 1) vegetation composition, 2) amount of runoff, sediment, and nutrients produced, and 3) amount of herbicide in runoff. Research was conducted on the Senesa Ranch located 56 km west southwest of San Antonio, Texas, in the northern Rio Grande Plains resource region. Nine watersheds were instrumented to collect samples for water quality analysis, <b>stage</b> <b>recorders</b> monitored depth and duration of runoff, and vegetation cover was monitored using three 3 O m line transects within each watershed. Three watersheds were treated with an aqueous solution of picloram and triclopyr (0. 56 kg ha- 1) in October, 1992, three with a pelleted formulation of tebuthiuron (2. 2 kg ha- 1) in March, 1992, and three left untreated. Both picloram/triclopyr and tebuthiuron applications were found to alter vegetation composition. For the 30 month period of the study brush cover declined 28 % and 40 %, with an increase in perennial grass cover of 230 % and 285 % on the piclorarn/tticlopyr and tebuthiuron treatments, respectively. Herbicide applications caused a significant decrease in runoff and production of water quality parameters. On the picloram/triclopyr watersheds, runoff decreased 79 %, sediment production 89 %, and nitrates 70 %. On the tebuthiuron watersheds, runoff decreased 38 %, sediment production 76 %, and nitrates 97 %. Water samples were analyzed for picloram and triclopyr. Herbicide concentrations during the first runoff event 23 days after application were 151 and 142 mg L- 1 for picloram and triclopyr respectively. These levels are substantially below 500 mg L- 1, the allowable picloram level set for drinking water standards by the United States EPA. Within eight months picloram levels declined to less than 5 mg L- 1, and triclopyr was undetectable (< 2 mg L- 1). By 18 months picloram levels were at or below detection limit (1 mg L- 1).
