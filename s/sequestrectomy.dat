30|$|We {{report a}} case of a 66 -year-old {{severely}} osteoporotic woman with bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) around her dental implants, who was treated successfully with teriparatide and <b>sequestrectomy</b> of the mandible. After 5  months of teriparatide therapy, the sequestrum separation had progressed and a <b>sequestrectomy</b> was performed under general anesthesia. Five months after the operation, new bone formation was observed around the bone defect in the region of the <b>sequestrectomy.</b> A repeat computed tomographic image revealed improvement in the bone defect in the mandible. These results suggest that teriparatide provides beneficial effects in the treatment of advanced BRONJ around dental implants.|$|E

Twelve eligible trials evaluating discectomy vs <b>sequestrectomy</b> were identified including one randomized controlled study, five prospective and six retrospective comparative studies. By contrast to discectomy, <b>sequestrectomy</b> was associated with significantly less operative time (p< 0. 001), lower visual analogue scale (VAS) for low back pain (p< 0. 05), less post-operative analgesic usage (p< 0. 05) and better patients' satisfaction (p< 0. 05). Recurrent herniation rate, reoperation rate, intraoperative blood loss, hospitalization duration and VAS for sciatica were without significant difference. According to our pooled data, <b>sequestrectomy</b> entails equivalent reherniation rate and complications compared with discectomy but maintains a lower incidence of recurrent low back pain and higher satisfactory rate.

40|$|We {{reviewed}} our institutional {{experience with}} pulmonary resection for congenital bronchopulmonary malformations and analysed {{the management and}} outcome of pregnancies with a prenatal diagnosis of congenital lung malformations. Between January 1993 and December 2003, 31 patients underwent evaluation and pulmonary resection for bronchopulmonary malformations. Common clinical presentations were respiratory distress (9), respiratory infections/pneumonias (22), and dyspnoea (9). Diagnostic modalities included chest radiography, CT scan (22), MRI scan (7), arteriography (1), and bronchoscopy (5). There were 13 congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations (CCAM), six pulmonary sequestrations, three bronchogenic cysts, and nine congenital lobar emphysemas (CLE). Fifteen patients who underwent resection were diagnosed by antenatal ultrasound. No foetus had hydrops or associated malformations. No pregnancy was terminated. There was no foetal demise. Regression of the sonographic appearance was observed in six cases. Amniotic puncture was required for hydramnios in three cases. Eight emergency resections were performed (CCAM 4; CLE 3; Bronchogenic cyst 1). Surgical procedures included 24 lobectomies, one right middle lobectomy with a wedge resection of the right lower lobe, one completion right lower lobectomy, four <b>sequestrectomies,</b> one mediastinal mass excision and one wedge resection for a bronchogenic cyst. There were no deaths. Postoperative complications included: persistent air leak (nZ 2; one requiring completion lobectomy) and pneumothorax (1). Persistent mild symptoms were present in five patients, at long-term follow-up. Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation and congenital lobar emphysema were the commonest congenital anomalies. Congenital lung malformations are increasingly diagnosed antenatally, sometimes necessitating emergent surgical resection. Th...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Pulmonary {{sequestration}} is a {{congenital malformation}} {{which consists of}} a functional part of the lung, separated of the normal airway, and vascularisated with anomal systemic artery instead of pulmonary artery. There {{are two kinds of}} sequestration. Intralobar is surrounded with normal lung and its pleura, and extralobar which has extrapulmonary position and pleura of its own. This anomaly is very rare and appears in 1. 1 − 1. 8 % of all congenital lung malformations. The illness is revealed either in early childhood with other life-threatening anomalies or in adulthood and middle age when secondary infection arises. The aim of this paper was to show our own experience in surgical treatment of pulmonary sequestration and to emphasize sequestration as a real differential-diagnostic possibility with patients with recidive bronchopneumonias. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed medical records for the period from 1967 − 2007 and found 15 patients with pulmonary sequestration at the average age of 30 years. We pointed out the well known problems with identification of this anomaly, preoperative diagnostic procedures and surgical possibilities of treatment. Results. There were 13 patients with intralobar and two patients with extralobar sequestration. By the use of preoperative angiography, seven patients were found to have intralobar pulmonary sequestration. All intralobar sequestrations were clinically manifested, the most often with recidive bronchopneumonia. Six patients had no preoperative diagnosis of lung sequestration. The most common locality of intralobar sequestration was the left lower lobe (eight patients). We performed nine lobectomies, three <b>sequestrectomies,</b> two segmentectomies and one pneumonectomy. Both extralobar sequestrations were diagnosed intraoperatively. Conclusion. Pulmonary sequestration is a rare malformation. Diagnosis is established by angiography. Treatment is exclusively surgical. In the last three years we have had one patient per year. This experience obliges to consider pulmonary sequestration as a real differential- diagnostic possibility in patients with localized repeated bronchopneumonias...|$|R

30|$|Before the {{introduction}} of reamed exchange nailing, the use of compression plating for femoral shaft nonunions was the gold standard.

40|$|The use of pedicled buccal fat pad flap (BFP) {{has proved}} of {{value for the}} closure of oroantral and oronasal {{communications}} and is a well-established tool in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Otherwise, the perceived limitations of surgical therapy for bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ) have been widely discussed, and recommendations have largely been made to offer aggressive surgery only to stage 3 patients refractary to conservative management. Oroantral communication may be a common complication after <b>sequestrectomy</b> and bone debridement in upper maxillary BRONJ.

40|$|Surgical {{removal of}} a {{symptomatic}} herniated lumbar disc is performed either {{with or without the}} support of a microscope. Up to the time of writing, the literature has reported similar clinical outcomes for the two procedures. Five hundred consecutive patients, operated upon for primary single-level lumbar disc herniation in our University Spine Center between 2003 - 2011, with (n= 275), or without (n= 225), the aid of a microscope were included. Data were retrospectively analyzed, comparing the primary endpoint of clinical outcome and the secondary endpoints of complications, surgical time and length of hospitalization. Clinical outcomes and reoperation rates were comparable in both groups. Surgical time was significantly shorter with a mean time of 47 minutes without use of the microscope compared to the mean time of 87 minutes (p< 0. 001) {{with the use of the}} microscope.

40|$|Background: Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) {{therapy is}} {{recognized}} as an adjunctive treatment for osteoradionecrosis (ORN). It may also be used prophylactically in patients who require dental extractions and {{are at high risk}} for developing ORN. This article reviews the treatment outcomes of patients treated with HBO therapy at the Toronto General Hospital from 1985 to 1997. Materials and Methods: A total of 297 charts of patients treated with HBO were reviewed. Criteria assessed included age of patient, gender, original diagnosis, radiation dose, time between radiation treatment and onset of ORN, presence or absence of fracture, orocutaneous fistula, pain, history of a precipitating event triggering ORN, medical status, HBO therapy (total oxygen time, number of dives), method of treatment of ORN and follow-up period. Minimum patient follow-up time for inclusion in the study was 6 months. Results: Adequate information to meet the inclusion criteria was obtained for 75 patients. Group A (51 patients) had been treated for overt ORN with HBO alone, HBO with <b>sequestrectomy,</b> or HBO with <b>sequestrectomy</b> and reconstruction. Group B (24 patients at risk for developing ORN) had been treated with HBO prophylactically for dental extractions. In group A, only 3 patients (5. 9 %) failed to show improvement. In group B, only one patient (4. 2 %) had complications during healing. Conclusions: Encouraging results were achieved when HBO was used in the 2 groups described above.

Clinical and MRI data of patients after limited discectomy with ACD implantation (group ACD; N= 45) and patients after <b>sequestrectomy</b> alone (group S; N= 40) with primary lumbar disc herniation were compared retrospectively. Pain intensity on the visual analogue pain scale (VAS), oswestry disability index (ODI) or the patient satisfaction index (PSI) were collected. Disc signal intensity, Modic type changes, endplate reactions, anular tears and reherniations were investigated using MRI before and < 18 months postoperative. Morphologic changes were correlated with clinical outcome. There was no difference in VAS back, VAS leg or ODI/PSI after the operation although group S showed significantly more reherniations in MRI.

However, the external fixators, without additional methods, do not solve the bone defect problem. The Ilizarov technique removes the bone defect through distraction at the corticotomy site and consequent new bone formation by intramembranous ossification, thus bridging the bone gap.
