5|$|According to a People {{magazine}} {{profile of}} McKenzie written in January 1953, McKenzie received an unceremonious notice from {{the owners of}} 10 Clarence Street to quit the premises. The Sands Directory indicates that she moved her operation briefly to No 6 Wharf at Circular Quay in 1953, before retiring to her home at Greenwich Point in 1954. McKenzie wrote that <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> school when the airlines established their own school and the government added a signals training section to the Navigation School at the Technical College. She continued to help the occasional pupil with special difficulties at her home.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of owner Charles van Raalte in 1907, his wife Florence stayed on Brownsea until 1925. Mary Bonham-Christie bought the island at an auction in 1927. In 1932, Bonham-Christie allowed 500 Scouts to camp there to {{celebrate}} the Silver Jubilee of Scouting, but shortly afterwards <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> island {{to the public and}} it became very overgrown. In 1934, some Sea Scouts were camping on the island when a fire broke out. Mrs. Bonham-Christie blamed the Sea Scouts, although the fire did not start where the Sea Scouts were camping. The fire engulfed most of the island, burning west to east. The eastern buildings were only saved by a subsequent change in wind direction. Although it was not known how the fire started, Scouts were not allowed to camp on the island again until after Bonham-Christie's death in 1961. Her family becoming liable for inheritance tax on her estate, they put the island up for sale. Interested citizens who feared that the island would be bought by developers helped raise an endowment, and in 1962 the government allowed the National Trust to take over management of the island in lieu of the death duties.|$|E

25|$|In the 1890s, Aimé Dupont began {{suffering}} from stomach cancer. Just {{prior to a}} sitting with Emma Eames, he fell ill {{and was unable to}} work. Despite never having done photography work before, Etta Dupont stepped in and successfully kept the appointment. From then on, she would be responsible for posing the subjects. Dupont died of his condition on 16 February 1900. Afterwards, Etta became the photographer for the business (and in later years, their son Albert also took his turn behind the camera), keeping the name Aimé Dupont Studio. For many years, a number of the photographic subjects were under the belief that she was Aimé Dupont. Her endeavors proved to be successful enough for her to open another studio in Newport, Rhode Island, photographing socialites when <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> New York studio for the summers. However, in 1906 the Metropolitan Opera, the studio's primary client, hired its own photographer, and without the artistic direction of Dupont, the business began to suffer. Finally, in 1920, Etta had to declare bankruptcy. She sold the business to an investor, and the name Aimé Dupont Studio continued as a portrait studio until the 1950s.|$|E

During the 2005-06 season, she made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Cherubino in Le nozze di Figaro and she also played Stéphano in Gounod's Roméo et Juliette at the Met. She returned to the Royal Opera House as Rosina in Il barbiere di Siviglia, sang her first Sesto in Mozart's La clemenza di Tito with Grand Théâtre de Genève, and sang {{the role of}} Dejanira in Handel's Hercules at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York and at the Barbican Centre in London with William Christie.

25|$|During 1993, O'Sullivan {{established}} {{herself as}} one of the world's top middle distance runners. By the time the World Championships came around, she was the clear favourite for both the 3000 m and 1500 m. However her hopes in the 3000 m were dashed by the performances of three Chinese athletes who would later in the year go on to smash the world record multiple times. The winner, Qu Yunxia, finished in a championship record of 8:28.71, with Zhang Linli and Zhang Lirong following in second and third respectively. A month later Qu would go on to set a 1500m world record of 3:50.46. O'Sullivan finished the race 4th in a time of 8:33.8. Six days later she won the Silver Medal in the 1500 m in a time of 4:03.48, again behind a Chinese athlete. Five days after the championships, at the ISTAF meet in Berlin, O'Sullivan recorded the season's best time over 5000 m of 14:45.92, which moved her to third on the all-time world list. Soon afterwards <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> year by winning the Grand Prix Final for the 3000 m and finished 2nd in the Mile. She finished the Grand Prix season in 2nd place in the Woman's Overall competition.|$|E
25|$|Her {{following}} two seasons were low profile, with 2005 being highlighted by a 100m win in Salamanca, and 2006 {{performances in the}} 200m including a win at the Reebok Grand Prix and a fifth-place finish at the USA Track and Field Championships. She began training with Olympic gold medalist Jon Drummond during this period. Her Olympic year form returned in 2007, which she began with personal record-equalling run of 11.26seconds at the Mt. SAC Relays and an outright 200m best of 22.46seconds to finish as runner-up at the Adidas Track Classic. She finished fourth in the 200m at the 2007 US Outdoor National Championships, but {{due to the fact}} that the race winner (Allyson Felix) was automatically qualified for the 2007 World Championships in Athletics as the reigning world champion, Moore gained a position on the US team. She went on to be one of four American women to reach the 2007 World 200m final (along with Felix, Sanya Richards and Torri Edwards) but she only managed seventh place with a below-peak form run of 22.97seconds. After making appearances in the 2007 IAAF Golden League, at the ISTAF and Memorial van Damme meetings, <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> season by winning a bronze medal at the 2007 IAAF World Athletics Final – her first global senior medal.|$|E
25|$|She came {{second at}} the 1997 US Indoors behind Dawn Burrell and was {{selected}} for the 1997 IAAF World Indoor Championships, where she finished twelfth in the final. She was fourth at the outdoor nationals and finished the year with a season's best of 6.64m. She regained her form in the 1998 season, taking second place at both the indoor and outdoor US Championships, and jumped 6.97m in Philadelphia in April. She took the long jump {{gold medal at the}} 1998 Goodwill Games, beating reigning world champion Lyudmila Galkina with a wind-assisted mark of 6.93m. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>the</b> season with a sixth place finish at the 1998 IAAF Grand Prix Final and her performances ranked her as the seventh best jumper in the world and second best American. She had her best indoor performances in the next season, taking the national indoor title and competing at the 1999 IAAF World Indoor Championships. In the world long jump competition she set an indoor career best of 6.82m, which brought her the silver medal behind Tatyana Kotova. Williams was third at that year's outdoor US Championships and had her season's best jump of 6.76m in Linz in July. By merit of her national performance, she earned selection for the 1999 World Championships in Athletics. In her only appearance at the competition, she finished twelfth in the final.|$|E

A request from the cruiser that the merchant ship make her signal letters clear, which the signals officer did by lengthening the halyard and swinging the flags clear. The callsign was that of the Dutch ship Straat Malakka, but she was not on Sydneys list of ships meant to be in the area. Further flag signals were exchanged between the ships, with Sydney asking the Dutch ship's destination and cargo.|$|E
