5|$|Alprazolam {{was first}} {{released}} by Upjohn (now {{a part of}} Pfizer) in 1981. The first approved use was of panic disorder, and within two years of its original marketing, Xanax became a blockbuster drug in the US. As of 2010, alprazolam is the most prescribed and the most misused benzodiazepine in the US. The potential for misuse among those taking it for medical reasons is controversial, with some expert reviews stating that the risk is low and {{similar to that of}} other benzodiazepine drugs. Others state that there is a <b>substantial</b> <b>risk</b> of misuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users and that the high affinity binding, high potency, short elimination half-life, and rapid onset of action may increase the misuse potential of alprazolam. Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior. Alprazolam is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).|$|E
5|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is taken}} by {{fisheries}} operating off Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and likely elsewhere, using longlines, gillnets, and trawls. The meat and liver are eaten, though sharks from certain areas present a <b>substantial</b> <b>risk</b> of ciguatera poisoning (especially the liver, which contains {{a much higher}} concentration of the toxin than the meat). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, as its numbers have dropped in recent decades due to increasing, and thus far unregulated, fishing pressure in the tropics. Its restricted habitat, low dispersal, and slow reproduction are factors that limit this shark's capacity for recovering from overfishing. On the Great Barrier Reef, populations of whitetip reef sharks in fishing zones have been reduced by 80% relative to no-entry zones. Furthermore, populations in no-take zones, where boats are allowed but fishing prohibited, exhibit levels of depletion comparable to fishing zones due to poaching. Demographic models indicate that these depleted populations will continue to decline by 6.68.3% per year without additional conservation measures.|$|E

25|$|Gagging {{anybody is}} very risky, as it {{involves}} a <b>substantial</b> <b>risk</b> of asphyxia if the subject's nose is blocked while wearing a gag. Using a gag on somebody who is ill or has a common allergy (including sensitivities to cologne or perfume) is also quite dangerous, as most gags make it difficult or impossible to breathe through the mouth. Vomiting and choking also pose a risk, since they further block the airway. A gagged subject should never be left alone.|$|E

The enactment of the Act was criticised by various pro-life groups and the Roman Catholic bishops, but supported by a majority of the electorate in polls, with many indicating they wished to see a more liberal law on abortion.|$|E

While the rewards may be substantial, transactions costs may make decisions irreversible. This paper draws {{a comparison between}} entrepreneurship and technology adoption. Adopting a new production technology also involves <b>substantial</b> <b>risks.</b> The economics of technology adoption is a well developed literature with many accepted and testable models. Most prominent are the theories of learning by using and learning by doing. We review the technology adoption literature, drawing out lessons for entrepreneurship research. We then apply an entrepreneurship as technology adoption model to a unique dataset collected during the tobacco buyout. The uncertainty in household income and changes in economic environment during the tobacco transition payment program lead many individuals into entrepreneurial activities. entrepreneurship, technology adoption, tobacco buyout, Agribusiness, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R

25|$|Potassium bromide {{is used in}} {{veterinary}} medicine to treat epilepsy in dogs, either as first-line treatment or in addition to phenobarbital, when seizures are not adequately controlled with phenobarbital alone. Use of bromide in cats is limited because it carries a <b>substantial</b> <b>risk</b> of causing lung inflammation (pneumonitis) in them. The use of bromide as a treatment drug for animals means that veterinary medical diagnostic laboratories are able {{as a matter of}} routine to measure serum levels of bromide on order of a veterinarian, whereas human medical diagnostic labs in the US do not measure bromide as a routine test.|$|E
25|$|Oyu Tolgoi mine {{is located}} {{in one of the}} driest areas in Mongolia. Rainfall in the desert area ranges between zero and 50mm per year. It is {{estimated}} that the water demand will triple in the coming two decades mainly due to mineral exploitation in the area. Herders worry that Oyu Tolgoi is draining the region’s water supply, since it uses more than a billion gallons of water a month. In addition, there is a <b>substantial</b> <b>risk</b> of acid rock drainage from the mine, from tailings storage facilities and from any overburden or waste rock stored on the surface and not deposited back into the mine.|$|E
25|$|In a {{classical}} metapopulation model, habitat occurs in discrete patches, {{with a population}} in any one patch facing a <b>substantial</b> <b>risk</b> of extinction at any given time. Because population dynamics in individual patches are asynchronous, the system is maintained by dispersal between patches (e.g. dispersal from patches with high populations can ‘rescue’ populations near or at extinction in other patches). Freckleton et al. have shown that, with a few assumptions (habitat patches of equal suitability, density independent extinction, and restricted dispersal between patches), varying overall habitat suitability in a metapopulation can generate a positive intraspecific O-A relationship. However, there is currently debate regarding how many populations actually fit {{a classical}} metapopulation model. In experimental systems using moss-dwelling microarthropods metapopulation dynamics were found to maintain the interspecific O-A relationship, however, Warren and Gaston were able to detect a positive interspecific O–A relationship {{even in the absence}} of dispersal, indicating that a more general set of extinction and colonization processes (than metapopulation processes per se) may maintain the O–A relationship.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{experts and}} major reports advise against relying on climate {{engineering}} techniques {{as a simple}} solution to global warming, {{in part due to}} the large uncertainties over effectiveness and side effects.
