50|$|The {{mechanical}} transmission {{in the rear}} part of the hull consists of a change gear quadrant, a primary multiplate clutch unit with metallic friction pads, a manual gearbox with five forward gears, two multiplate planetary <b>steering</b> clutches with <b>band</b> <b>brakes</b> and two in-line final drive groups.|$|R
25|$|A <b>band</b> <b>brake</b> {{consists}} of a band, strap, or cable that wraps around a drum that rotates with a wheel and is pulled tight to generate <b>braking</b> friction. <b>Band</b> <b>brakes</b> appeared as early as 1884 on tricycles. Star Cycles introduced a <b>band</b> <b>brake</b> in 1902 on its bicycles with freewheels. <b>Band</b> <b>brakes</b> are still manufactured for bicycles today.|$|R
50|$|<b>Band</b> <b>brakes</b> can be simple, compact, rugged, and can {{generate}} high force {{with a light}} input force. However, <b>band</b> <b>brakes</b> are prone to grabbing or chatter and loss of brake force when hot. These problems are inherent with the design and thus limit where <b>band</b> <b>brakes</b> are a good solution.|$|R

50|$|The {{foot pedal}} {{operates}} by rod a transmission brake {{mounted on the}} rear end of the gearbox's second motion shaft. It {{is described as a}} powerful double-acting <b>band</b> <b>brake.</b> The brake's drum is surrounded by a water jacket. The hand lever operated side brakes (on the rear wheels) are also double-acting <b>band</b> <b>brakes.</b> These drums are fixed to the rear wheels. The operating lever is inside the car by the right hand of the driver. The system of rods and levers incorporates an equalising arrangement.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2006, {{it was announced that}} Eamon had left British Sea Power to concentrate on his own <b>band</b> <b>Brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Eamon Peter Hamilton is {{the singer}} and {{songwriter}} for the <b>band</b> <b>Brakes,</b> born on 20th August 1975 in Stewart, BC, Canada {{and raised in}} Stroud, Gloucestershire, UK.|$|R
50|$|On September 1, 2008 Zailckas married Eamon Hamilton, {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} of the acclaimed <b>band</b> <b>Brakes,</b> whom she {{met on the}} social networking site Myspace, in Romainville, France.|$|R
25|$|A rim <b>band</b> <b>brake,</b> as {{implemented}} on the Yankee bicycle by Royce Husted in the 1990s, {{consists of}} a stainless-steel cable, wrapped in a kevlar sheath, that rides in a u-shaped channel {{on the side of}} the wheel rim. Squeezing the brake lever tightens the cable against the channel to produce braking friction. A return spring slackens the cable when the brake lever is released, no adjustment is required, and the brake becomes more forceful when wet. Husted said his inspiration was the <b>band</b> <b>brake</b> used on industrial machinery. The Yankee bicycle only included a rear brake, but that met U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission standards.|$|R
2500|$|The main {{landing gear}} is an [...] go-cart wheel mounted as a fixed monowheel, with a brake {{fashioned}} from aluminium sheet and employed as a <b>band</b> <b>brake,</b> actuated by a bicycle brake lever mounted on the control stick.|$|R
50|$|Each of {{the speed}} ratios {{available}} to a simple planetary gear train {{can be obtained by}} using <b>band</b> <b>brakes</b> to hold and release the carrier, sun or ring gears as needed. This provides the basic structure for an automatic transmission.|$|R
5000|$|By a <b>band</b> <b>brake,</b> {{integral}} with a chain/rope drum, {{installed at the}} top. A brakeman working in a wooden tower above the 18 ft diameter drum controlled this brake and from his elevated position he had a commanding view of the inclined plane.|$|R
5000|$|Each power car is {{fitted with}} two {{traction}} motors of [...] total output, delivered via shafts and gear drives, using a permanently operating cogwheel with {{a diameter of}} 573 mm. The units are also equipped with several brake systems - electrodynamic brake, ratchet parking brake and hydraulic and manual <b>band</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{patent application}} proposed that electromagnetic clutches {{be used in}} the transmission. The year of the patent was 1949, a time when pressure operated hydraulic technology was less well developed. Several years later, when the Ravigneaux went into production at Ford Motor Company, hydraulically operated <b>band</b> <b>brakes</b> and cluches were used.|$|R
5|$|The {{transmission}} of the T-26 consisted of single-disc main dry clutch, a gearbox with five gears in the front part of the vehicle, steering clutches, final drives and <b>band</b> <b>brakes.</b> The gearbox {{was connected to the}} engine by a drive shaft passing through the vehicle. A gear change lever was mounted directly on the gearbox.|$|R
50|$|While {{young men}} were risking their necks on the high wheels, ladies and dignified gentlemen such as doctors and clergymen of the 1880s favoured the less risky tricycle. Many {{innovations}} for tricycles eventually {{found their way into}} the automobile, such as rack and pinion steering, the differential, and <b>band</b> <b>brakes,</b> the forerunners to drum brakes.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>band</b> <b>brake</b> is {{a primary}} or {{secondary}} brake, consisting of a band of friction material that tightens concentrically around a cylindrical piece of equipment to either prevent it from rotating (a static or [...] "holding" [...] brake), or to slow it (a dynamic brake). This application is common on winch drums and chain saws and is also used for some bicycle brakes.|$|R

He has since become a permanent replacement for previous keyboard player Eamon Hamilton who left to front Brighton-based rock <b>band</b> <b>Brakes.</b> His cornet playing however marks a new sound for the band.|$|R
50|$|An improved, second series {{model was}} {{introduced}} in 1939, distinguished as was Fiat's custom at the time by a letter added to the model name: the Fiat 1500 B. It had more powerful brakes and an handbrake acting on the transmission through a <b>band</b> <b>brake</b> instead than on the rear axle drum brakes as before. The 1500 B was otherwise virtually undistinguishable from the original model.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{nonlinear}} sliding-mode controller {{is designed}} for force tracking of a piezoelectric-hydraulic pump (PHP) -based actuation system, which is developed to replace the current electro-hydraulic actuation systems for automatic transmission (AT) friction elements, such as <b>band</b> <b>brakes</b> or clutches. By utilizing the PHP, one can eliminate the various hydraulic components (oil pump, regulating valve and control valve) in current ATs and achieve a simpler configuration with more efficient operation. With the derived governing equation of motion of the PHP-based actuation system integrated with the friction element (<b>band</b> <b>brake),</b> a switching control law is synthesized based on the sliding-mode theory. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the proposed control law, its force tracking performance for the engagement of a friction element during an AT ##IMG## [[URL] { 1 to 2 } up-shift is examined experimentally. It is shown that one can successfully track the desired force trajectory for AT shift control with small tracking error. This study demonstrates the potential of the PHP as a new controllable actuation system for AT friction elements...|$|R
40|$|Two ways {{to improve}} {{efficiency}} of components based on Talbot effect are considered in the present paper. One way is based on optimization of waveguide wall impedance, another one consists in modification of waveguide cross-section shape. Both methods allow correction of waveguide modes spectrum and lead to efficiency enhancement. For the important application of Talbot effect-remote steering antenna of a wavebeam in plasma-the <b>steering</b> <b>band</b> is expanded by 40 - 50 %...|$|R
50|$|Early {{motorcycles}} {{which were}} essentially a bicycle with a motor attached {{and did not}} have any braking system beyond slowing the motorcycle down and putting a foot out. One of the first motorcycles to have any sort of braking mechanism was made by Steffey Motorcycles of Philadelphia in 1902. This used a spoon brake operating on the front wheel only. Around 1909 <b>band</b> <b>brakes</b> were introduced, these used a band contracting round the outside of a drum.|$|R
50|$|Autocar's staff {{drove the}} 2-seater car {{for ten days}} {{covering}} some 400 miles. The control turning the engine into an air brake is sufficient for most purposes and the double <b>band</b> <b>brakes</b> are only needed for the steepest hills or an emergency stop. Turning the car at a very sharp angle puts greater tension on the ignition or throttle control and the engine speed is upset. The car has a good turn of speed and climbs extremely well hills.|$|R
50|$|Wire spokes can be radial to the hub but {{are more}} often mounted {{tangentially}} to the hub. Tangential spoking allows for the transfer of torque between the rim and the hub. Tangential spokes are thus necessary for the drive wheel, which has torque at the hub from pedalling, and any wheels using hub-mounted brakes such as disk or <b>band</b> <b>brakes,</b> which transfer torque from the rim to the brake in the opposite direction—(via the hub) when braking.|$|R
50|$|The Skootamota handled {{well and}} was very stable despite small wheels. The single-cylinder 123 cc engine was located above the rear wheel and drove it by chain. Early Skootamotas had exhaust over intake (EOI) engines but later {{versions}} had OHV engines. The Skootamota had external contracting <b>band</b> <b>brakes</b> on both wheels. The saddle and spacious footboard provided rider comfort. The Skootamota, quickly imitated by competitors, had {{a top speed of}} just 15 mph. It ceased production in 1922.|$|R
50|$|The Cotal self-changing gearbox of the 1930s was a {{manually}} controlled epicyclic, {{like the}} Wilson. The {{difference is that}} instead of <b>band</b> <b>brakes,</b> it used electromagnetic clutches. These two clutches each consisted of a central rotating disk (a simple steel pole piece) {{and a pair of}} coil-carrying rings, one rotating and one fixed (this coil could be considered as either a clutch or a brake). Sliprings were used to transmit electrical power to the rotating clutch elements.|$|R
50|$|Bottled at Source is a {{compilation}} album by British <b>band</b> Turin <b>Brakes.</b> It marks {{the end of}} a decade with their Source label.|$|R
50|$|The Flying Merkel had a {{conservative}} engine-control system featuring an automatic inlet valve and a pre-set outlet valve. The V-shaped engine initially displaced 884 cc and delivered 6 hp through a two-speed gearbox and a belt, {{and had a}} maximum speed of 97 km/h. A motorsports version without brake was available with a 997 cc motor including roller bearings, Bosch magneto ignition, Schebler carburetor and chain drive. The roadworthy version had a <b>band</b> <b>brake</b> on the rear wheel and was sold for $325 USD.|$|R
50|$|The Lily {{features}} a Flemish brake design which incorporates a rope drum which lifts a loaded lever {{which in turn}} pulls a set of wooden blocks tightly around the windshaft (the shaft the sails are mounted on). This brake design {{which is similar to}} a <b>band</b> <b>brake</b> is very effective when the sails are facing the wind, but much less so when the wind is coming from behind. For this reason a ‘kneppel’ is installed which prevents counter-rotation of the sails when the windmill has stopped.|$|R
50|$|This trike uses dual, {{independently}} controlled, <b>band</b> <b>brakes.</b> These have a {{band that}} contract around a drum to stop the vehicle. They take a bit of force on the brake levers, but they can lock the wheels up on lower traction conditions, and are quite effective at stopping. The brakes {{can be used to}} help steer in fresh snow, or other conditions where the front wheel will hydroplane instead of steering. It is very difficult to use the right brake and throttle at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{drum brake}} usually means a brake in which shoes press {{on the inner}} surface of the drum. When shoes press {{on the outside of}} the drum, it is usually called a clasp brake. Where the drum is pinched between two shoes, similar to a {{conventional}} disc brake, it is sometimes called a pinch drum brake, though such brakes are relatively rare. A related type called a <b>band</b> <b>brake</b> uses a flexible belt or [...] "band" [...] wrapping around the outside of a drum.|$|R

50|$|The Wilson gearbox was {{produced}} {{with a variety}} of clutches. The best-known is the fluid flywheel, used for touring cars such as the Daimler and the Armstrong-Siddeley. Sports cars used a Newton centrifugal clutch. This was a multiple plate dry clutch, similar to racing manual clutches of the time, but with the pressure plate centrifugally actuated to engage at around 600rpm. Pure racing cars, such as the ERA, avoided a clutch altogether and relied on the progressive engagement of the gearbox's <b>band</b> <b>brake</b> on lowest gear when starting.|$|R
5000|$|Give Blood is {{the debut}} album from the Brighton-based <b>band,</b> <b>Brakes.</b> The album was {{recorded}} onto 2" [...] tape and mixed onto 1/4" [...] tape in January 2005. Brakes and their 22-year-old producer, Iain Gore, also removed all computer screens {{from the studio}} for the week and all the tracks were recorded live, with the duets being recorded around one mike. The only overdubs were lap steel on [...] "Jackson" [...] by bassist Marc Beatty, piano by drummer Alex White and guitar by Tom White on [...] "I Can't Stand To Stand Beside You".|$|R
