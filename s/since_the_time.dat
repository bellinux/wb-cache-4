5|$|Much of Shen Kuo's written {{work was}} {{probably}} purged {{under the leadership}} of minister Cai Jing (1046–1126), who revived the New Policies of Wang Anshi, although he set out on a campaign of attrition to destroy or radically alter the written work of his predecessors and especially Conservative enemies. For example, only six of Shen's books remain, and four of these have been significantly altered <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> they were penned by the author.|$|E

5|$|A library {{has been}} present <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of StWerburgh's Abbey, and {{following}} {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries it became the cathedral library. It continued to grow over the centuries, but by the 19thcentury it had become neglected. Between 1867 and 1885 it was enlarged and in the 1890s new bookcases were added. A further reorganisation took place in the 1920s but by the 1980s the contents were contained in five separate sites around the cathedral. A programme of repair and re-cataloguing of the contents was instituted. During the 2000s more work was carried out and the refurbished library, housed in three rooms, opened in 2007. The library is available for research and for organised visits by groups.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1850s the {{miasma theory}} of disease was largely {{superseded}} by the germ theory of disease, creating extensive interest in microorganisms and {{their interactions with}} other forms of life. By the 1880s, bacteriology was becoming a coherent discipline, especially through the work of Robert Koch, who introduced methods for growing pure cultures on agar gels containing specific nutrients in Petri dishes. The long-held idea that living organisms could easily originate from nonliving matter (spontaneous generation) was attacked {{in a series of}} experiments carried out by Louis Pasteur, while debates over vitalism vs. mechanism (a perennial issue <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of Aristotle and the Greek atomists) continued apace.|$|E
5|$|During his reign, he {{completed}} the conquest and expulsion of the Hyksos from the delta region, restored Theban rule {{over the whole}} of Egypt and successfully reasserted Egyptian power in its formerly subject territories of Nubia and Canaan.

This building program culminated {{in the construction of the}} last pyramid built by native Egyptian rulers. Ahmose's reign laid the foundations for the New Kingdom, under which Egyptian power reached its peak. His reign is usually dated to the mid-16th century BC.|$|E

Depictions have existed from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France dated to 17,000 years ago, through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they once occurred. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures, in paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of the Roman Empire, and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoos over the world since the late eighteenth century. Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered Asiatic lions.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} to Martlesham, Dowding {{outlined}} his concerns about night interceptions and {{the characteristics of a}} proper night fighter. Since the interceptions were long affairs, the aircraft needed to have long endurance. To ensure that friendly fire was not an issue, pilots would be required to identify all targets visually. This meant a separate radar operator would be needed, so the pilot would not lose his night vision by looking at the CRTs. And finally, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> needed to arrange an interception was so long, the aircraft required armament that could guarantee destruction of a bomber in a single pass—there was little chance a second interception could be arranged.|$|E
5|$|Phan {{was born}} in the village of Đông Thái in the {{northern}} central coast province of Hà Tĩnh. Đông Thái was famous for producing high-ranking mandarins and had been the home of senior imperial officials <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of the Lê Dynasty. Twelve consecutive generations of the Phan family had been successful mandarinate graduates. All three of Phan's brothers who lived to adulthood passed the imperial examinations and became mandarins. Early on, Phan indicated his distaste for the classical curriculum required of an aspiring mandarin. He nevertheless persevered with his studies, passing the regional exams in 1876 and then topping the metropolitan exams the following year. In his exam response, Phan cited Japan {{as an example of how}} an Asian country could make rapid military progress given sufficient willpower.|$|E

5|$|Roman {{military}} equipment was mass-produced in state-run fabricae ("factories") which brought together advanced forging technology and skilled artisans. Roman weapons were mostly made of internally produced steel such as chalybs Noricus which {{was superior to}} unhardened iron. In contrast, forging technology, capacity and personnel were more limited in Germania libera, although {{there is evidence that}} production and standardization of equipment had greatly improved <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of the Roman Principate. Steel-making was also known in Germania libera (spathae and rapier-like swords out of flexible steel were in use). But Alamanni production of sophisticated forge-products such as metal armour, helmets and swords was on a much smaller scale than the Romans'. Simple weapons such as axes and knives seem often to have been made of unhardened iron.|$|E
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of McCarthy, {{the word}} McCarthyism has entered American speech {{as a general}} term {{for a variety of}} practices: aggressively {{questioning}} a person's patriotism, making poorly supported accusations, using accusations of disloyalty to pressure a person to adhere to conformist politics or to discredit an opponent, subverting civil and political rights in the name of national security, and the use of demagoguery are all often referred to as McCarthyism. McCarthyism can also be synonymous with the term witch-hunt, both referring to mass hysteria and moral panic.|$|E
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of its {{discovery}} in 1905, {{there have been}} many attempts to estimate the population size of this species. Results varied greatly, but the more recent ones suggest a very reduced number of individuals. This coupled with a very restricted distribution have led to the listing of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis as an endangered or threatened species. Humans frequently invade its habitat, though such disturbances have been greatly reduced by preventive measures. Recent efforts in conservation include perpetuating the extant population at a baseline size as well as maintaining captive populations.|$|E
