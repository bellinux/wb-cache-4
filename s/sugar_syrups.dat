40|$|Dietary {{energy for}} {{chickens}} normally includes cereal grains and fat. This innovative {{study investigated the}} effect of replacing part of the corn and fat in broiler chicken rations with graded levels of <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> on growth performance and biochemical parameters. Experimental treatments consisted of feeding a corn-soy basal diet alone, or with graded levels of <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> in increments of 5 %, 10 % and 15 %. All starter diets were isonitrogenous and isocaloric. Body weight gain and efficiency of feed utilization of chicks fed the control diet alone were not significantly (P <  0. 05) different from chicks fed diets supplemented with either 5 % or 15 % <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup.</b> Supplementation of <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> to broiler diets had no significant effect on blood glucose, creatinine, total protein, or liver enzymes. Adding 5 % <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> to broiler rations significantly decreased blood cholesterol and triglycerides in chickens fed the <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> diet compared with birds fed the control diet. In conclusion, the results shows <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> {{can be used in}} poultry ration to replace part of the corn as a source of energy.

The Chaenomeles genotypes tested were valuable in terms of vitamin C content. Storage significantly reduced the vitamin C content in the fruit, by 20 % on average after 2 weeks of storage. The mechanical treatment and preparation of <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> decreased the vitamin content by nearly two-thirds when compared with the fruit at harvest.

50|$|In {{consumer}} marketing, it {{is difficult}} to find examples of undifferentiated approaches. Even goods such as salt and sugar, which were once treated as commodities, are now highly differentiated. Consumers can purchase a variety of salt products; cooking salt, table salt, sea-salt, rock salt, kosher salt, mineral salt, herbal or vegetable salts, iodized salt, salt substitutes and many more. Sugar also comes in many different types - cane sugar, beet sugar, raw sugar, white refined sugar, brown sugar, caster sugar, sugar lumps, icing sugar (also known as milled sugar), sugar syrup, invert sugar and a plethora of sugar substitutes including smart sugar which is essentially a blend of pure sugar and a sugar substitute. Each of these product types is designed {{to meet the needs of}} specific market segments. Invert sugar and <b>sugar</b> <b>syrups,</b> for example, are marketed to food manufacturers where they are used in the production of conserves, chocolate and baked goods. Sugars marketed to consumers appeal to different usage segments - refined sugar is primarily for use on the table, while caster sugar and icing sugar are primarily designed for use in home-baked goods.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} types of energy feeding (<b>sugar</b> <b>syrup,</b> inverted <b>sugar</b> and juice of sugar-cane) on beeswax production and its economic feasibility are evaluated. Twenty beehives of Africanized Apis mellifera were selected, and five were used for each type of feeding. The treatments were T 1 (sugar-cane juice), T 2 (<b>sugar</b> <b>syrup)</b> and T 3 (inverted sugar). Feedings was provided by Boardman feeders and the amount was adjusted according to consumption. A layer of beeswax was manually set up into the honeybee nest and beeswax built area was measured weekly. Total reducing sugar, calorimetry, dry matter and ashes of all feedings were analyzed. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance with Tukey’s test to determine differences among averages. The average consumption of inverted sugar was significantly lower than that of other treatments. The highest beeswax production average occurred in the <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> treatment. The highest average of ashes, dry matter and reducing sugar occurred, respectively, in sugar-cane juice, inverted <b>sugar</b> and <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup.</b> <b>Sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> may be an alternative energy source for beeswax production, although sugar-cane juice may be more profitable. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of honey adulteration detection has recently increased {{owing to the}} limited production levels {{in recent years and}} to the relative high price of honey, therefore this illegal practice has becoming more and more attractive to producers. Hence the need has arisen for more effective analitical methods aiming at detecting honey adulteration. The present research presents an effective method to detect adulteration in honey falsified by intentional addition of different concentrations of commercial <b>sugar</b> <b>syrups,</b> using one-dimensional (1 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) coupled with multivariate statistical analysis. Sixty-three authentic and 63 adulterated honey samples were analysed. To prepare adulterated honeys, 7 different <b>sugar</b> <b>syrups</b> normally used for nutrition of bees were used.

40|$|Although beer {{refermentation}} {{in bottles}} {{is essentially a}} simple process, mixing mature beer with yeast and sugar before bottling, refermentation {{is often difficult to}} control in industrial practice. This can result in variable batch-to-batch quality, especially in small-scale breweries. In this study, industrial top-fermented beers were mixed with freshly propagated yeast and fermentable extract. The extract consisted of glucose, fructose, maltose, sucrose, or one of several commercially available <b>sugar</b> <b>syrups.</b> Glucose, fructose, and sucrose were fermented at comparable rates, reaching final attenuation within two weeks. Maltose was only partially fermented or not fermented at all, depending mainly on the yeast strain used. Several factors that may affect sugar uptake were examined. Carbon dioxide pressure in the bottled beer accounted for most of the loss in the capacity of the yeast to ferment maltose, while it had only a minor influence on the uptake of glucose and fructose. This difference is probably due to the different mechanisms by which these sugars are transported into the cell. Although maltose is the main sugar in brewing wort, its use is not appropriate for bottle refermentation. The use of <b>sugar</b> <b>syrups</b> with high maltose content may lead to irreproducible or stuck fermentations. Moreover, residual extract promotes inconsistent yeast deposit stability. status: publishe...|$|E
