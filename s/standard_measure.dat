5|$|The {{rotational}} {{period of}} each star {{can be measured}} by observing periodic variations in the doppler shifts of their spectral lines. The absolute rotational velocities of the two stars are known from their inclinations, rotation periods, and sizes, but the projected equatorial rotational velocities measured using doppler broadening of spectral lines are a <b>standard</b> <b>measure</b> and these are generally quoted. Capella Aa has a projected rotational velocity of 4.1±0.4 km per second, taking 104 ± 3 days to complete one rotation, while Capella Ab spins much more rapidly at 35.0±0.5 km per second, completing a full rotation in only 8.5 ± 0.2 days. Rotational braking occurs in all stars when they expand into giants, and binary stars are also tidally braked. Capella Aa has slowed until it is rotationally locked to the orbital period, although theory predicts that it should still be rotating more quickly from a starting point of a rapidly-spinning main sequence A star.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} evaluating the performance of query retrieval systems, and we propose a sampling technique for efficiently estimating <b>standard</b> <b>measures</b> of retrieval performance using incomplete judgments. Unlike existing techniques which (1) rely on effectively complete, and thus prohibitively expensive, relevance judgment sets, (2) produce biased estimates of <b>standard</b> performance <b>measures,</b> or (3) produce estimates of non-standard measures thought to be correlated with these <b>standard</b> <b>measures,</b> our proposed sampling technique produces unbiased estimates of the <b>standard</b> <b>measures</b> themselves. Our technique is based on random sampling, and as such, the greater the number of random samples (i. e., relevance judgments), the higher the accuracy of our estimators. We further derive a number of enhancements to the general technique which allow one to determine accurate estimates for the <b>standard</b> performance <b>measures</b> associated with large collections of systems from a single, small judgment pool. Our experiments with the benchmark TREC data collection indicate that highly accurate estimates of these <b>standard</b> <b>measures</b> can be obtained using a number of relevance judgments as small as 2 % of the typical judgment pool...|$|R

They provide a physical <b>standard</b> <b>measure</b> that could be used when printing the chart.

25|$|The {{original}} {{designers of}} gross product accounts (such as Simon Kuznets, Colin Clark, Edward Fulton Denison and Richard Stone) aimed precisely to exclude any capital gains (or other income from asset transactions and revaluations) from their measure of gross output, just like transfer payments. They wanted a reliable <b>standard</b> <b>measure</b> {{that would indicate}} changes {{in the value of}} the net new addition to wealth per year or per quarter: roughly, the total sales revenue from production less intermediate costs, or, the value of total outputs produced less the value of goods and services used up to produce them, or, the sum of factor incomes directly generated by production. The issue then is, how exactly the grossing and netting must be done to obtain the value of total output, and it is done in a different way than business itself would do it (to eliminate non-production income/expenditure, ensure uniform valuation, and remove double counting; from the point of view of national accounts, in fact real credits can become theoretical debits, and real debits can become theoretical credits).|$|E
500|$|In 1971, with Byungkook Lee, Richards {{introduced}} {{the concept and}} a quantitative measure for the solvent-accessible surface (SAS) of amino acid residues in folded protein structures (...) [...] The surface is constructed by tracing {{the center of an}} imaginary ball, its radius that of a water molecule (taken as 1.4Å), as it rolls over the van der Waals surfaces of the proteins. Thus defined, the surface is continuous and each point on it is unambiguously associated with a specific protein atom (the nearest). The Lee & Richards definition has been widely adopted as the <b>standard</b> <b>measure</b> for solvent accessibility, for instance to evaluate exposure per residue as a percentage of accessible vs total surface area, and as the basis of the buried-surface-area method for estimating the energetics of protein/protein contacts.|$|E

Since the mass of the sample is known, this can be converted to a <b>standard</b> <b>measure</b> of activity in units of either counts per minute per gram of carbon (cpm/g C), or becquerels per kg (Bq/kg C, in SI units). Each measuring device is also used to measure the activity of a blank sample– a sample prepared from carbon old enough to have no activity. This provides a value for the background radiation, which must be subtracted from the measured activity of the sample being dated to get the activity attributable solely to that sample's [...] In addition, a sample with a standard activity is measured, to provide a baseline for comparison.|$|E
