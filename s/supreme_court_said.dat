The Palestinian has denied selling the building to the settlers, and last month the Israeli <b>supreme</b> <b>court</b> <b>said</b> the house should be evacuated until the ownership dispute was settled.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> that Swamy had {{the locus}} standi to seek {{sanction}} from the Prime Minister {{for the prosecution}} of A Raja in the 2G scam. Sanction by a competent authority for the prosecution of a public servant has to be granted within a time frame, the apex court said. Justice AK Ganguly said that the sanction would be deemed to be granted if competent authority failed to take a decision within four months.|$|E

The Louisiana <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> that Judge Drew's sentence was excessive for the crime committed and ordered a resentencing. Drew instead reduced the sentence to $1,000 in fines and court costs and allowed Byars' work on a booklet that he had written, Louisiana Teachers Guide, count as the public service component of the sentence.|$|E
25|$|The Montana Supreme Court {{has twice}} had {{occasion}} to rule on administrative issues facing District Courts. In , the issue was the substitution and disqualification of District Court judges. If a District Court has not published rules regarding substitution and disqualification, the high court said, then Montana Supreme Court rules regarding the same hold sway. In , the issue was whether a District Court could continue to operate even though its budget {{for the fiscal year}} had ended. Here, the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> that District Courts had the authority to order the state to pay reasonable and necessary expenses.|$|E
25|$|Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Company v. Railway Labor Executives' Association, 491 U.S. 490 (1989) - The Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad {{sold its}} assets to CSX Transportation {{and refused to}} bargain with the RLEA's member unions over the sale. The Supreme Court held {{that there was a}} duty to bargain (but not over the sale itself), but that this duty to bargain ended when the sale was complete. Lower courts had enjoined the union from striking, but the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> it was unclear if there were grounds to do so. It remanded the strike issue back to the lower courts.|$|E

25|$|The {{status of}} McCune's {{religious}} beliefs {{is open to}} dispute. Mormon missionary Stuart Martin wrote in 1920 that McCune was not a Mormon, but had many Mormon friends and had given much money to the church. Judge Orlando Powers, Associate Justice of the Utah <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> <b>said</b> in 1906 that he understood that McCune was not a Mormon. Frank J. Cannon, too, claimed McCune was not a Mormon,and B. H. Roberts, LDS Church historian {{and member of the}} First Council of the Seventy, said in 1930 that McCune was not a church member. Historian Orvin Malmquist, however, says that church records show he was baptized into the LDS Church at the age of eight in 1857, and that his marriage to Elizabeth Claridge in a Mormon temple in 1872 could not have occurred without his being a church member. It is not in dispute that he was baptized by proxy in 1969.|$|E
25|$|At {{the debate}} at Freeport Lincoln forced Douglas {{to choose between}} two options, either of which would damage Douglas' {{popularity}} and chances of getting reelected. Lincoln asked Douglas to reconcile popular sovereignty with the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision. Douglas responded {{that the people of}} a territory could keep slavery out even though the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> that the federal government had no authority to exclude slavery, simply by refusing to pass a slave code and other legislation needed to protect slavery. Douglas alienated Southerners with this Freeport Doctrine, which damaged his chances of winning the Presidency in 1860. As a result, Southern politicians would use their demand for a slave code for territories such as Kansas to drive a wedge between the Northern and Southern wings of the Democratic Party. In splitting what was the majority political party in 1858 (the Democratic Party), Southerners guaranteed the election of Lincoln, the nominee of the newly formed Republican Party, in 1860.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} whether Douds remains good case law. The Supreme Court {{distinguished}} the case but declined to overrule Douds in Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951). In 1965, in United States v. Brown, 381 U.S. 437 (1965), the Supreme Court essentially overturned Douds by holding that the Taft-Hartley Act's oath constituted a bill of attainder, but did not formally do so. Two years later, in United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258 (1967), the Court specifically declined to apply a balancing test to a law prohibiting members of the Communist Party from holding jobs in the defense industry. Although the law was based on the same rationale as Taft-Hartley (that membership in the Communist Party was a sure indication of future action), the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> this was too heavy an infringement on the individual's First Amendment rights. Instead, the Court seemed to suggest a new, two-part test: Whether the governmental interests advanced are valid, and whether the statute is narrowly drawn to infringe on First Amendment rights in the most narrow way. The Court returned to the balancing test in Brandenberg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 (1969), but this time concluded that prohibiting mere advocacy of violence was too heavy a burden on the First Amendment. Such advocacy must produce imminent action for the speech to be punishable, the Court held.|$|E

5000|$|The state Senate Republican leader, Paul McKinley, {{expressed}} {{disappointment and}} called for a constitutional amendment that [...] "protects traditional marriage." [...] Iowa Governor Chet Culver stated that he was [...] "reluctant to support amending the Iowa Constitution to add a provision that our <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> has <b>said</b> is unlawful and discriminatory." ...|$|R
500|$|Parties {{involved}} in the case also had mixed reactions. The Legal Services Corporation, which had sought to protect the restrictions, said it would [...] "immediately review [...] regulations and then modify them to adhere to the Court's ruling", which it did quickly after the decision. Burt Neuborne, the lawyer who argued against the restriction before the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> <b>said</b> the ruling [...] "really reads like a First Amendment textbook".|$|E
500|$|In one of {{the final}} {{decisions}} of the Burger Court, the Court ruled in 1986 in Bowers v. Hardwick that [...] "homosexual sodomy" [...] was not protected by the right of privacy and could be criminally prosecuted by the states. In 1995, however, that ruling was effectively gutted by Romer v. Evans, which struck down a Colorado state constitutional amendment, passed by popular vote, that forbade antidiscrimination laws' being extended to sexual orientation. Scalia dissented from the opinion by Justice Kennedy, believing that Bowers had protected {{the right of the}} states to pass such measures and that the Colorado amendment was not discriminatory but merely prevented homosexuals from gaining favored status under Colorado law. Scalia later said of Romer, [...] "And the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>said,</b> 'Yes, it is unconstitutional.' On the basis of—I don't know, the Sexual Preference Clause of the Bill of Rights, presumably. And the liberals loved it, and the conservatives gnashed their teeth".|$|E
500|$|The {{manner in}} which the program was {{canceled}} led to years of litigation between the contractors and the Department of Defense over breach of contract. On 1 June 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the U.S. Navy was justified in canceling the contract. [...] The ruling also required the two contractors to repay the U.S. government more than US$1.35 billion, plus interest charges of US$1.45 billion. Boeing, which had merged with McDonnell Douglas, and General Dynamics vowed to appeal the ruling. [...] In September 2010, the U.S. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> <b>said</b> it would hear the two companies' arguments, that the government canceled the project improperly and that the use of a state secrets claim by the U.S. prevented them from mounting an effective defense. [...] In May 2011, the Supreme Court set aside the Appeals Court decision and returned the case to federal circuit court. [...] In January 2014, the case was settled with Boeing and General Dynamics agreeing to pay $200 million each to the U.S. Navy.|$|E
