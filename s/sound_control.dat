500|$|The {{graphics}} and gameplay {{were the most}} praised aspects of the game. Scary Larry of GamePro hailed the game as being longer, more graphically impressive, and more fun than the original Donkey Kong Country, and having [...] "some of the most cleverly illustrated levels ever seen on a home system." [...] He gave it a perfect 5/5 in all four categories (graphics, <b>sound,</b> <b>control,</b> and FunFactor), and said his one reservation is that some levels are too difficult for younger players. Aaron Kosydar of AllGame thought that Diddy's Kong Quests graphics were superior than that of its predecessor, stating that the game [...] "looks as cool as it plays". Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer stated that the graphics of the game were similar its predecessor, although he praised them both as [...] "impressive". However, Whitehead expressed concern over the lack of ambition from the sequel, stating that the gameplay uses the defence of [...] "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". Reviewing the SNES version, Frank Provo of GameSpot heralded the graphics as [...] "more detailed" [...] although admitting that it appeared stylistically similar to the first game. In a separate review regarding the Game Boy Advance version, Provo praised the graphics as richer and [...] "livelier" [...] {{than those of the}} original. In a retrospective review, Mark Birnbuam of IGN stated that whilst the original [...] "boasted {{some of the most beautiful}} graphics" [...] on the SNES at the time, Diddy's Kong Quest offered a superior experience due to its detail, smooth animation and varying colour palette.|$|E

500|$|Chrono Trigger {{garnered}} much critical praise {{in addition}} to its brisk sales. Famicom Tsūshin gave Chrono Trigger first an 8 out of 10 and later a 9 out of 10 in their Reader Cross Review. Nintendo Power compared it favorably with Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy, and , citing improved graphics, sound, story and gameplay over past RPG titles. GamePro praised the varied gameplay, the humor, the ability to replay the game with previously built-up characters, and the graphics, which they said far exceed even those of Final Fantasy VI. They commented that combat is easier and more simplistic than in most RPGs, but argued that [...] "Most players would choose an easier RPG of this caliber over a hundred more complicated, but less developed, fantasy role-playing adventures." [...] They gave the game a perfect 5 out of 5 in all four categories: graphics, <b>sound,</b> <b>control,</b> and funfactor. Chrono Trigger won multiple awards from Electronic Gaming Monthlys 1995 video game awards, including Best Role-Playing Game, Best Music in a Cartridge-Based Game, and Best Super NES Game. Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine described Trigger as [...] "original and extremely captivating", singling out its graphics, sound and story as particularly impressive. IGN commented that [...] "it may be filled with every imaginable console RPG cliché, but Chrono Trigger manages to stand out among the pack" [...] with [...] "a [...] story that doesn't take itself too serious [...] " [...] and [...] "one of the best videogame soundtracks ever produced". Other reviewers (such as the staff of RPGFan and RPGamer) have criticized the game's short length and relative ease compared to its peers. Victoria Earl of Gamasutra praised the game design for balancing [...] "developer control with player freedom using designed mechanics and a modular approach to narrative." ...|$|E
500|$|Pilotwings 64 {{was well}} {{received}} by most reviewers. The game's combination of 3D graphics, realistic settings, and flight simulation were applauded by many news sources and major gaming publications. In his release {{review of the}} Nintendo 64, The Seattle Times contributor Steven L. Kent found that the flight mechanics and vast areas featured in Pilotwings 64 make {{it one of the}} most impressive games ever made. Glenn Rubenstein of the website GameSpot summarized, [...] "The graphics, <b>sound,</b> <b>control,</b> and all around excitement add up to make Pilotwings 64 one hell of a great ride." [...] Staff reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly, GamePro, and IGN all voiced positive comments on the game's polygon rendering and frame rates, as well as its sense of control and flying. Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games enjoyed the game's large environments, exclaiming, [...] "You'll not believe just how huge the islands really are and, because certain elements are hidden at first, it'll take you months to see everything." [...] IGN's Levi Buchanan described this low-pressure, [...] "challenge without competition" [...] aspect of the game as a design philosophy adopted by later Nintendo titles such as Nintendogs. Rich Leadbetter of Maximum said that [...] "The sedate nature of the gameplay might not appeal to everyone, but the bottom line is that PilotWings 64 is an unparalleled test of skill, dexterity and control. It is a game that you must own and whilst not quite in the same league of 'must-have'itude as Super Mario 64, it remains an astounding achievement and another triumph for Nintendo." [...] A Next Generation critic remarked that once beyond the introductory missions the game becomes satisfyingly challenging, and succeeds as both a flight simulation and an example of Nintendo's surrealistic gameplay: [...] "It's a weird mix of total realism and self-conscious videogame elements, and the two don't grate." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{various aspects}} of Super Mario RPG have {{received}} mixed reviews, the game garnered praise {{for the quality of}} the graphics and for the humor in particular. Nintendo Powers review commented that the [...] "excellent" [...] 3D graphics helped the game appeal to a much wider audience than most traditional RPGs. In March 1997, Nintendo Power nominated the game for several awards, including [...] "Best Graphics", in a player's choice contest, though Super Mario 64 won [...] "Best Graphics". Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the graphics, stating that they are [...] "the best seen on the Super NES". Scary Larry of GamePro gave the game a perfect 5/5 in all four categories (graphics, <b>sound,</b> <b>control,</b> and FunFactor), and highly praised the rendered enemies, cinematics, and spell animations. 1UP.com stated that the graphic element is [...] "strong enough to resemble a Mario title but still retains the role-playing theme at the same time", and Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the graphics are [...] "typical of Nintendo, using clean and colorful graphics along with nice animation". RPGamer editor Derek Cavin called the backgrounds [...] "beautiful" [...] and stated that they [...] "perfectly bring the Mushroom Kingdom and surrounding areas into 3D". Skyler Miller from Allgame stated that the graphics are [...] "absolutely outstanding, with colorful, 3D rendered visuals that once seemed impossible on the Super NES. This is definitely the high watermark for 3D graphics on any 16-bit system". The editor also called the music [...] "quite extraordinary" [...] and that the songs [...] "match the mood of the surrounding environment". In the Virtual Console re-release, IGN's Lucas Thomas's review of Super Mario RPG stated that the game's experience [...] "completes itself with a compelling story, a humorous attitude and a variety of interspersed mini-games that break up the adventuring action". The publication also stated that the soundtrack is [...] "spectacular and a joy to listen to" [...] and the graphics [...] "took full advantage of the system's 16-bit technology and looks great".|$|E
