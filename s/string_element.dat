Since {{the point where}} the string is attached to the rigid body is displaced from the center of mass of the rigid body, there exist nonlinear coupling effects between the string deformation and the rigid body dynamics. A geometric numerical integrator, refereed to as a Lie group variational integrator, is developed to numerically preserve the Hamiltonian structure of the presented model and its Lie group configuration manifold. These properties are illustrated by a numerical simulation. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures. Fixed notation errors involving the mass of the rigid body and the <b>string</b> <b>element...</b>|$|E

40|$|The Prüfer Code is a {{bijection}} {{between the}} n n− 2 {{trees on the}} vertex set [1, n] and the n n− 2 strings in the set [1, n] n− 2 (known as Prüfer strings of order n). Efficient linear-time algorithms for decoding (i. e., converting string to tree) and encoding (i. e., converting tree to string) are well-known. In this paper, we examine an improved decoding algorithm (due to Cho et al.) that scans {{the elements of the}} Prüfer string in reverse order, rather than in the usual forward direction. We show that the algorithm runs in linear time without requiring additional data strutures or sorting routines, and is an ‘online ’ algorithm — every time a new <b>string</b> <b>element</b> is read, the algorithm can correctly output an additional tree edge without any knowledge of the future composition of the string. This new decoding algorithm allows us to derive results concerning the ‘locality’ properties of the Prüfer Code (i. e., the effect of making small changes to a Prüfer string on the structure of the corresponding tree). First, we show that mutating the µth element of a Prüfer string (of any order) causes at most µ + 1 edge-changes i...|$|E
40|$|Identification {{of protein}} {{structural}} neighbors to a query is fundamental in {{structure and function}} prediction. Here we present BS-align, a systematic method to retrieve back-bone string neighbors from primary sequences as tem-plates for protein modeling. The backbone conformation of a protein {{is represented by the}} backbone string, as defined in Ramachandran space. The backbone string of a query can be accurately predicted by two innovative technologies: a knowledge-driven sequence alignment and encoding of a backbone <b>string</b> <b>element</b> profile. Then, the predicted backbone string is employed to align against a backbone string database and retrieve a set of backbone string neighbors. The backbone string neigh-bors were shown to be close to native structures of query proteins. BS-align was successfully employed to predict models of 10 membrane proteins with lengths ranging between 229 and 595 residues, and whose high-resolution structural determinations were difficult to elucidate both by experiment and prediction. The obtained TM-scores and root mean square deviations of the models confirmed that the models based on the backbone string neighbors retrieved by the BS-align were very close to the native membrane structures although the query and the neigh-bor shared a very low sequence identity. The backbone string system represents a new road for the prediction of protein structure from sequence, and suggests that the similarity of the backbone string would be more infor-mative than describing a protein as belonging to...|$|E

In many studies, the interest is limited to relatively low frequencies and a detailed investigation into the ability of models to accurately simulate higher-order responses is unnecessary. In cases where an in-plane model is to be used for the generation of the contact deformation and stresses, or where modal reduction methods are implemented, a detailed knowledge of the modal response is desirable. The present work forms a study on the ability of a number of frequently used modelling approaches to generate realistic modal data throughout a wide frequency range. The analytical ring on elastic foundation model is used as a benchmark throughout the paper. Its predictions are compared with those of two discretised models, namely a truss- and a beam-based model. The sensitivity of the ring’s response to a number of physical parameters is discussed. The results are used to inform the comparison between the analytical ring and the discretised models, providing explanations for any discrepancies observed. The limited applicability of the truss model is pointed out, while the accuracy of the beam-based model is enhanced by a circumferential inextensible <b>string</b> <b>element.</b> Both the ring and the enhanced beam models are further improved {{with the addition of a}} nonlinear string-based sidewall that accounts for the change in sidewall stiffness with inflation pressure.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work is on the {{simulation}} of crack propagation and delamination in layered shells due to cutting by sharp blades. The main features of these type of problems are: material non-linearities, contact, large deformations, fracture and delamination make the problem highly non-linear, suggesting {{to carry out the}} simulation in an explicit dynamics framework; the shell layered structure with possible delamination suggest the use of solid-shell elements; the very small thickness of individual layers requires a selective mass scaling to allow for an efficient implementation of solid-shell elements in explicit dynamics; the dominant crack path is determined by the known blade trajectory, which justifies the adoption of an inter-element description of fracture; the blade sharpness introduces in the problem an extremely small geometrical scale (orders of magnitude smaller than a typical element in-plane finite element size) which cannot be resolved using standard cohesive element formulations. In order to obtain an accurate prediction of crack propagation, the cutting process is here described by means of directional cohesive elements [1, 2], i. e. massless string elements attached to the opening faces, dissipating the interface cohesive energy upon elongation and able to detect contact with the cutting blade. Upon contact, the <b>string</b> <b>element</b> interacts with the cutting blade and deforms, transmitting cohesive forces to the two crack flanks in the correct directions. The presence of different layers is accounted for by stacking one or more solid-shell elements per layer through the thickness. An ad-hoc procedure for topology updating has been developed to handle the through-the-thickness crack propagation. The effect of the number of introduced directional cohesive elements per opening face is critically assessed. Possible layer delamination is accounted for by introducing cohesive interfaces between layers...|$|E
40|$|Deep {{drilling}} technologies use MWD (Measuring While Drilling) and LWD (Logging While Drilling) systems {{near the}} drill bit {{in order to}} gather large amounts of directional and geological information. The data are mostly processed downhole. To transmit the main results to the surface in nearly real time a high speed data communication system with more than 100 bit/s is highly advantageous. The most commonly usedprocessfor data transmission in boreholes is the so called mud pulse telemetry. However, mud pulse telemetry systems cannot transmit such high data rates. A significant improvement is expected {{through the use of}} acoustic waves along the drill string for data transmission. In the 1980 s and 1990 s there were some attempts to transmit the downhole data by means of acoustic signals along the metallic drill string to the surface. However, these trials were not much of a success, because the acoustic transmission channel of a real drill string was too complex for the applied modulation schemes. In details, a drill string channel configuration consisting {{of a large number of}} drill pipes and tooljoints with different diameters causes multiple signal reflections and depending on the superimposing of all reflections with the original signal, pass- and stop bands will be created. This limits the achievable data rate, because only thepassbands are suitable for use by data transmission. Moreover, the characteristics of the pass- and stop bands vary with each change in the drill string configuration. Because of such challenging issues, the acoustic transmission process is significantly complex. However, the deployment of new actuators in combination with latest state of the art techniques from mobile communications can overcome the mentioned difficulties. Such techniques enable for instance an adaptive bi-directional communication to be applied, whereby the data transmission can continuously be adapted to the changing channel characteristics. As a first step for the application of the acoustic communication system on a real drill string a prototype systemfor unidirectional communication (uplink transmission) was developed and built up. Due to their relatively large sizes (outer diameter: 11 1 / 4 "), the current prototype components cannot be used in standard deep bottom hole assemblies. However, suitable drill strings for such prototype sizes are found in mining drilling operations, for example with raise bore drilling. Thus, the initial prototype components were designed to be integrated into a raise bore drill string. The highly robust communication concept was developed to allow initial data rates of up to 30 bit/s. The prototype transmitting system consists of two units. The first one is located downhole. It includes a generator, a battery and a transmitter-sub. Furthermore there is the surface unit, which includes a receiver module, a WLAN access point and a terminal computer. The downhole batteiy can be recharged by a downhole alternator, which is driven by the drilling mud. The receiver module is attached to the uppermost drill <b>string</b> <b>element</b> and connected via a WiFi module to the terminal computer. At the surface unit the received data will be decoded and evaluated. The communication system is ready to be tested on a real well to transmit different types of data to the surface and to decode them there. The data to be transmitted during the initial field test will include information about the battery status, the temperature of the downhole unit in addition to dynamic and directional drilling data. In order to test the application limits as well as the robustness of the novel acoustic data transmission system, the influence of different interferences and noise sources on the data transmission quality were to he investigated. Unfortunately, the field trial was delaved several times and in the end cancelled in the scope of this project. But results from laboratory tests are available. During these investigations with the new acoustic communication telemetry system several interfering signals were generated to simulate real operation. Water waspumped through the system and the mechanical interaction between the drill string and the borehole wall was reproduced by rubbing on the drill string with sandpaper and applying hammer scales as well as combinations thereof Although the induced interferences reduced the quality of the data stream, the data transmission along the drill string was still possible in the presence of any kind of interference. The next development step would be the implementation of an adaptive, bi-directional communication system. This already has been built up and tested in the laboratory setup. The bi-directional communication system will significantly increase the transmission rate...|$|E
