First, is has been operationalized as {{the sum of}} exports and imports {{as a percentage of}} the GDP (trade volume) using the World Development Indicators (WDI) as data <b>source</b> (<b>World</b> <b>Bank</b> 2016). Second, we have used the import-penetration ratio (imports as a percentage of GDP) also from the WDI. Third, we constructed an indicator for structure-adjusted trade intensity. Following Pritchett (1991), this was estimated as the residuals of a regression of trade volume on the following variables: population, surface area, real GDP, real GDP squared and whether the country is an oil producer. 4 To this end, we used an unbalanced panel of 164 countries for the 1960 – 2011 period with the WDI as data source except for real GDP, which we have estimated from the Penn World Table (PWT) 8.0 dataset (Feenstra et al. 2015). 5 As we used panel data, we also included a trend term in our pooled OLS regression. To avoid taking logs of negative values, we transformed the values of structure-adjusted trade intensity by adding 1 minus the minimum value of this indicator in our dataset.|$|E

The main variable external debt has significantly negative impact on dependent variable GDP so it’s concluded that Pakistan should go for the option of debt forgiveness and must invite FDI but not much as their overloading may hurt the economy. Adjusting saving (ADS) highly significant positive relation with GDP reveals that habit of saving extremely boost up economy growth. Exports is basically good to helping hand for economy so they must be lifted up. The impact of external debt is quite hostile on growth so steps must be taken to abolish it in order to growth of economy...|$|E

This theory first proposed by Mundell (1961) as a basis for evaluating whether or not an area constitutes an optimal currency area is exploited in assessing whether or not the WAMZ constitutes an OCA. Methodology/Design/Approach-Data utilized for the trend analysis were <b>sourced</b> from the <b>World</b> <b>Bank's</b> <b>World</b> Development indicator (WDI) and annual reports of the central bank of each WAMZ member country considered. The data spans from 2002 to 2013 and it covers five (5) WAMZ member countries. Similarly, data for the trade analysis was <b>sourced</b> from the <b>World</b> <b>Bank's</b> <b>World</b> Integrated Trade Solution (WITS) and it for the period 2000 to 2012. Findings-While, I found strong evidence against trade symmetry in the WAMZ, there are some evidence of marginal convergence in inflation, real GDP growth and monetary policy rate. Moreover, while I found reasons to believe that the convergence is partially {{as a result of the}} convergence criteria, trade in WAMZ remains significantly low and more so for WAMZ's trade in West Africa. Originality/value-This paper concludes that on the basis of trade, WAMZ does not qualify as an OCA.

METHODS: For statistics regarding the population of each country in the Mediterranean area, we accessed authoritative international <b>sources</b> (<b>World</b> <b>Bank,</b> <b>World</b> Health Organization and United Nations). The prevalence of CD was obtained for most countries from published reports. An overall prevalence rate of 1 % cases/total population was finally estimated to represent {{the frequency of the}} disease in the area, since none of the available confidence intervals of the reported rates significantly excluded this rate. The distribution of symptoms and complications was obtained from reliable reports in the same cohort. A standardized mortality rate of 1. 8 was obtained from recent reports. Crude health cost was estimated for the years between symptoms and diagnosis for adults and children, and was standardized for purchasing power parity to account for the different economic profiles amongst Mediterranean countries. RESULTS: In the next 10 years, the Mediterranean area will have about half a billion inhabitants, of which 120 million will be children. The projected number of CD diagnoses in 2020 is 5 million cases (1 million celiac children), with a relative increase of 11 % compared to 2010. Based on the 2010 rate, there will be about 550 &#x 2005; 000 symptomatic adults and about 240 &#x 2005; 000 sick children: 85 % of the symptomatic patients will suffer from gastrointestinal complaints, 40 % are likely to have anemia, 30 % will likely have osteopenia, 20 % of children will have short stature, and 10 % will have abnormal liver enzymes. The estimated standardized medical costs for symptomatic celiac patients during the delay between symptom onset and diagnosis (mean 6 years for adults, 2 years for children) will be about &#x 20 AC; 4 billion (&#x 20 AC; 387 million for children) over the next 10 years. A delay in diagnosis is expected to increase mortality: about 600 &#x 2005; 000 celiac patients will die in the next 10 years, with an excess of 44. 4 % vs age- and sex-matched controls.

This study employed annual time series data on energy consumption (ED), real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (RGDP), real energy prices (P) and urbanization (N) for a thirty-six-year sample period.

40|$|The {{issue of}} the effects of {{government}} interventions, explicitly of the taxes and expenditures of local public authorities, has generated substantial debate over time, and still gives rise to numerous controversies in theory and practice. Following the Keynesian path of reasoning, it is, at least theoretically, admitted {{that it is possible to}} influence the socio-economic activities and support for economic growth by means of government spending, but different other factors act towards enhancing or, on the contrary, impeding the achievement of the desired effects. From this point of view, the delimitation of competences and public expenditure responsibilities between different levels of government raises the issue of some possible different effects of the central and local governments’ interventions. As the macroeconomic stabilization function is usually associated with central governments, and the contribution of local governments often is of lesser importance, less attention is paid to the effectiveness of local administrative actions. In such a context, the paper aims to empirically evaluate the effects of the economic structure of local public expenditures on the local (territorial) economic growth in Romania, over the period 2007 to 2012. The analysis has been conducted at the level of the 42 Romanian counties and on annual data collected from both international and national <b>sources</b> (<b>World</b> <b>Bank,</b> INSSE, The Romanian Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration). The general method of estimation is the fixed effects estimation technique for panel data models. Our empirical approach is of absolute novelty, especially for Romania, where previous empirical studies have been focusing on the assessment of the overall effects of general government spending. The main findings of our study are that local public expenditures have a negative impact on territorial economic growth, confirmed both for overall expenditures and for various structural components (given the economic structuring of local spending). Striking appears to be the negative impact of the interest payments on local public debt, which calls for the improvement of local government debt management and the selection on the basis of efficiency criteria of local investment projects, in many cases financed by debt issuing. At the same time, the very significant negative impact of social expenditures, currently mandatory expenditures of local governments, draws attention to the need to reconsider public policies and the relationships between different public budgets. Our findings also confirm the unproductive character of local transfer and goods and services expenditures, for which the results are to be interpreted as an alert signal to Romanian local authorities...|$|R
