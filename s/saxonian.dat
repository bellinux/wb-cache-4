25|$|No {{official}} {{attempts to}} create an orthography have been made, nevertheless there are countless short stories, poems and songs written in Erzgebirgisch. The Sächsischer Heimatverein guidelines to writing in Erzgebirgisch were established in 1937, but are by and large not respected {{by the majority of}} authors. This means that linguistic analysis of this dialect has to be done in a field work setting with native speakers. An additional threat to Erzgebirgisch is the popular misconception that Erzgebirgisch was a hillbilly variety of <b>Saxonian,</b> which does not help the conservation efforts.|$|E
25|$|Bach {{also wrote}} secular cantatas, for {{instance}} {{for members of}} the Royal-Polish and Prince-electoral <b>Saxonian</b> family (e.g. Trauer-Ode), or other public or private occasions (e.g. Hunting Cantata). The text of these cantatas was occasionally in dialect (e.g. Peasant Cantata) or in Italian (e.g. Amore traditore). Many of the secular cantatas went lost, but for some of these the text and the occasion are known, for instance when Picander later published their libretto (e.g. BWV Anh.11–12). Some of the secular cantatas had a plot carried by mythological figures of Greek antiquity (e.g. Der Streit zwischen Phoebus und Pan), others were almost miniature buffo operas (e.g. Coffee Cantata).|$|E
500|$|The last {{case where}} this {{punishment}} is, by some, {{alleged to have}} been meted out in 1734, somewhere in Saxony. [...] Another tradition, however, is evidenced from the <b>Saxonian</b> city Zittau, where the last case {{is alleged to have}} happened in 1749. In at least one case in Zittau 1712, a non-venomous colubrid snake was used. The Zittau ritual was to put the victims in a black sack, and keep it under water for no less than six hours. In the mean time, the choir boys in town had the duty to sing the Psalm composed by Martin Luther, [...] "Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir" [...] (From deep affliction I cry out to you) The punishment of the sack was expressly abolished in Saxony in a rescript dated 17 June 1761 ...|$|E

In addition to his activity as a propagandist, he worked on his definitive tract of sociolinguistics, Limba română ("The Romanian Language"), put out by Editura Fundațiilor Regale. According to philologist Pompiliu Constantinescu, the work exceeded [...] "the narrow bounds of specialization", turning the historical development of language and into the ethnographic [...] "mirror" [...] of Romanian culture and civilization. Limba română broke ground in the professional study of the Romanian lexis, with a phonaesthetic retrospective on the national poet Mihai Eminescu and a sociological analysis of neologisms.|$|E
