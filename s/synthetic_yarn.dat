25|$|Machine-knitted jumpers {{tend to use}} finer wool, cotton, or <b>synthetic</b> <b>yarn</b> {{and have}} less complex patterns, {{since many of the}} {{traditional}} stitches cannot be reproduced this way. They are generally flatter, lighter and less substantial, without the pronounced texture of a hand knitted or hand loomed jumper. Machine knitted jumpers will loosen with wear, and so it is advisable to buy one size smaller than the size of the sweater usually worn. They are the least expensive option. Hand-looming allows more complicated stitches to be used, will have fewer stitches to the inch and be thicker. The best quality hand-loomed jumpers are almost indistinguishable from hand knit. Hand-knit jumpers tend to be more tightly knit, to have more complex stitch patterns and to be longer-lasting and they attract a significant price premium.

40|$|Water vapour {{permeability}} {{and transport}} {{depends on the}} properties of the fibre and knitted fabric structure. It was designed double-layered fabrics knitted in plain plating pattern whose inner side was  made from synthetic fibres the PES, PA, PP, and Coolmax ® (tetra-channel fibres by DuPont) which do not absorb moisture and {{on the surface of the}} wear – natural cotton and bamboo fibres which have good absorption properties. In the present research it was established that the air permeability of all fabrics after washing and drying cycle decreased. It occurred because of the influence of shrinkage during washing and drying under the impact of moisture, heat, and mechanical action. After washing and drying cycle, the water vapour permeability of fabrics knitted from bamboo and <b>synthetic</b> <b>yarns</b> blend decreased predominantly and became similar to fabrics knitted from cotton and respective <b>synthetic</b> <b>yarns</b> blend. The water vapour permeability of fabrics knitted from cotton and <b>synthetic</b> <b>yarns</b> blend decreased significant less. Depending on the knitting structure, the most decrease of water vapour permeability was estimated to the plain plated fabrics. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R

Copper and gold are good materials to be used for this purpose because of their outstanding electro-conductive properties and possibility to deposit them in form of a thin layer on the surface of a fiber. In this work preference was given to copper. Hence, a thin layer of copper was deposited on <b>synthetic</b> <b>yarns</b> by means of an electroless deposition.
