5|$|According to legend, the Nez Perce tribe {{was first}} {{founded in the}} valley of the Clearwater River, one of the <b>Snake</b> River's {{lowermost}} major tributaries. At its height, there were at least 27 Nez Perce settlements along the Clearwater River and 11 more on the <b>Snake</b> between the mouth of the Clearwater and Imnaha Rivers. There were also villages on the Salmon River, Grande Ronde River, Tucannon River, and the lower Hells Canyon area. The <b>Snake</b> River's annual salmon run, which was estimated at that time to exceed four million in good years, supported the Nez Perce, who lived in permanent, well-defined villages, unlike the nomadic southeastern tribes along the <b>Snake</b> River. The Nez Perce also were involved in trade with the Flathead tribe to the north and other middle Columbia River tribes. However, they were enemies to the Shoshone and the other upstream <b>Snake</b> River tribes.|$|E

5|$|Formed by the {{confluence}} of three tiny headstreams on the southwest flank of Two Oceans Plateau in western Wyoming and Yellowstone National Park, the <b>Snake</b> starts out as a small river flowing west and south into Jackson Lake. Its first 50 miles (80 km) run through the valley of Jackson Hole, which cuts between the Teton Range and the Continental Divide. The <b>Snake</b> takes a large bend northwest through <b>Snake</b> River Canyon, cutting through the <b>Snake</b> River Range and into eastern Idaho, receiving first the Hoback and Greys rivers before entering Palisades Reservoir. There it is also met by the Salt River {{at the mouth of}} Star Valley. After passing through Palisades Dam, the <b>Snake</b> River flows through the <b>Snake</b> River Plain, a vast physiographic province extending through southern Idaho across the massif of the Rocky Mountains and underlain by the <b>Snake</b> River Aquifer, one of the most productive aquifers in the United States.|$|E
5|$|From its {{headwaters}} on Two Ocean Plateau in Yellowstone National Park, the <b>Snake</b> River flows {{north to}} south through the park, entering Jackson Lake near the boundary of Grand Teton National Park and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. The <b>Snake</b> River then flows through the spillways of the Jackson Lake Dam and from there southward through Jackson Hole, exiting the park {{just west of the}} Jackson Hole Airport. The largest lakes in the park all drain either directly or by tributary streams into the <b>Snake</b> River. Major tributaries which flow into the <b>Snake</b> River include Pacific Creek and Buffalo Fork near Moran and the Gros Ventre River at the southern border of the park. Through the comparatively level Jackson Hole valley, the <b>Snake</b> River descends an average of , while other streams descending from the mountains to the east and west have higher gradients due to increased slope. The <b>Snake</b> River creates braids and channels in sections where the gradients are lower and in steeper sections, erodes and undercuts the cobblestone terraces once deposited by glaciers.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, CrossGen {{published}} John Carpenter's <b>Snake</b> Plissken Chronicles, a four-part {{comic book}} miniseries. The story takes place {{a day or}} so after the events of Escape from New York. <b>Snake</b> has been given a military Humvee after his presidential pardon and makes his way to Atlantic City. Although the director's cut of Escape from New York shows <b>Snake</b> was caught after a bank job, this story has <b>Snake</b> finishing up a second heist that was pre-planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which John F. Kennedy was assassinated from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the Gulf of Mexico. <b>Snake</b> partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, <b>Snake</b> escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, Captain Ron). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat in order to beat Marrs to the robbery, <b>Snake</b> decides to kill him. When <b>Snake</b> ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps <b>Snake.</b> Once at the casino, <b>Snake</b> comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed shootout. <b>Snake</b> gets away with the car and its actress portraying Jackie Kennedy, leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, <b>Snake</b> manages to finally get the car to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and <b>Snake</b> makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job.|$|E

5|$|Many {{factors have}} {{influenced}} the construction of dams along the <b>Snake</b> River. A total of fifteen dams have been constructed along the <b>Snake</b> River for a multitude of different purposes, from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains to its mouth on Lake Wallula, a slackwater reservoir formed behind McNary Dam on the Columbia River. Dams on the <b>Snake</b> can be grouped into three major categories. From its headwaters {{to the beginning of}} Hells Canyon, many small dams block the <b>Snake</b> to provide irrigation water. Between here and Hells Canyon, the first dam on the <b>Snake,</b> Swan Falls Dam, was built in 1901. In Hells Canyon, a cascade of dams produce hydroelectricity from the river's lofty decrease in elevation over a comparatively small distance. Finally, a third cascade of dams, from Hells Canyon to the mouth, facilitates navigation. Many different government and private agencies have worked to build dams on the <b>Snake</b> River, which now serve an important purpose for people living in the Snake's drainage basin and trade of agricultural products to Pacific seaports.|$|E
5|$|More than 11,000 years ago, prehistoric Native Americans lived {{along the}} <b>Snake.</b> Salmon from the Pacific Ocean spawned by the {{millions}} in the river.

By the time Lewis and Clark crossed the Rockies and sighted the valley of a <b>Snake</b> tributary, the Nez Perce and Shoshone were the most powerful peoples in the region. Some tribes adopted use of horses after contact with Europeans, which reshaped their hunting and cultures for the next few hundred years before outside settlement. Later explorers and fur trappers further changed and used the resources of the <b>Snake</b> River basin. At one point, a hand sign made by the Shoshones representing fish was misinterpreted to represent a <b>snake,</b> giving the <b>Snake</b> River its name.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the return}} flows do not issue {{directly}} back into the <b>Snake</b> River, but rather feed the <b>Snake</b> River Aquifer underneath the <b>Snake</b> River Plain. Water diverted from the river for irrigation, after absorbing any surface pollutants, re-enters the ground and feeds the aquifer. Although the aquifer has maintained its level, {{it has become increasingly}} laced with contaminants. Water in the aquifer eventually travels to {{the west side of the}} <b>Snake</b> River Plain and re-enters the river as springs. Throughout much of the <b>Snake</b> River Plain and Hells Canyon, excessive sediment is also a recurring problem. In December 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along the <b>Snake</b> River to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40%.

5|$|Not many predators {{challenge}} {{an adult}} black mamba {{although it does}} face a few threats such as birds of prey, particularly <b>snake</b> eagles. Although all species of <b>snake</b> eagle commonly prey on snakes, there are two species in particular that do so with high frequency, including preying on black mambas. These are the black-chested <b>snake</b> eagle (Circaetus pectoralis) and the brown <b>snake</b> eagle (Circaetus cinereus). The Cape file <b>snake</b> (Mehelya capensis), which is apparently immune to all African <b>snake</b> venoms and preys on other snakes including venomous ones, is a common predator of black mambas (limited only by the size it can swallow). Mongooses, which also are partially immune to venom, and are often quick enough to evade a bite, will sometimes tackle a black mamba for prey. Humans do not usually consume black mambas, but they often kill them out of fear.|$|E
