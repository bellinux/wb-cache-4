Jackman commented that with Aronofsky directing, Wolverine 2 {{will not be}} [...] "usual" [...] stating, [...] "This is, hopefully for me, {{going to be out}} of the box. It's going to be the best one, I hope... Well, I would say that, but I really do feel that, and I feel this is going to be very different. This is Wolverine. This is not Popeye. He's kind of dark... But, you know, this is a change of pace. Chris McQuarrie, who wrote The Usual Suspects, has written the script, so that'll give you a good clue. [...] going to make it fantastic. There's going to be some meat on the bones. There will be <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> as you leave the theater, for sure". The film was scheduled to begin principal photography in March 2011 in New York City before the production moves to Japan for the bulk of shooting.|$|E
500|$|After Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix was released, Nomura {{wanted to}} expand Roxas' {{role in the}} series to explain the events between his birth and his {{disappearance}} from Organization XIII. For Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, the staff thought that Roxas' role {{as a member of}} the group would be a suitable theme for the plot. Roxas was chosen as the game's protagonist as the staff thought that having a main character besides Sora would help to introduce gamers to the series' first Nintendo DS title. Co-director Tomohiro Hasegawa explained that Roxas' was originally shorter, and the staff decided he should grow taller as the game continued to develop. Nomura wanted to portray Roxas' activities differently from Sora's. In Sora's games, he is on a journey around the world, while Roxas always returns to Organization XIII after each mission. The staff constructed Roxas' interactions with the Disney characters differently from Sora's, as the Organization was meant to be secret in the game's story. Nomura told the writers that he wanted Roxas to learn something from each of his missions or just to have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> Nomura later clarified that Roxas' personality was different from the one portrayed in Kingdom Hearts II, as he does not actively attempt to come into contact with other characters. With Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, Nomura wanted to reveal why Roxas left Organization XIII. Although Nomura found it a sad story, he considered Zack Fair's ending in [...] to be more tragic. Nomura felt Roxas' last words in the game were also the title's most significant, as he wanted them to connect to Kingdom Hearts IIs first scene, which is actually the same scene. Uchiyama expressed sadness when the game's development ended as he would not play the character for a long time.|$|E

2500|$|During initial {{interrogation}} {{without a}} lawyer, the police used suggestive question techniques to introduce Andersen {{to the idea}} that Viggo Kristiansen was a participant and even the leading force of the crime. The interrogator wrote the following in the police rapport: [...] "I explained for Andersen that the police now knew {{he was one of the}} perpetrators. I also told Andersen about the advantages he would get by explaining everything", and furthermore: [...] "I asked Andersen if he himself could be a victim in some sense since his best buddy Viggo Kristiansen could have been the most active participant. When I said this, it was obvious that Andersen got <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> We talked a little bit back and forth about the relationship between Andersen and Kristiansen, and there was no doubt that Kristiansen was the strong one, the one in charge".|$|E
2500|$|In 1903, Remington painted His First Lesson set on an American-owned {{ranch in}} Chihuahua, Mexico. The hands wear heavy chaps, starched white shirts, and slouch-brimmed hats. In his paintings, Remington sought {{to let his}} {{audience}} [...] "take away <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> – to imagine." [...] In 1905, Remington had a major publicity coup when Collier's devoted an entire issue to the artist, showcasing his latest works. It was that same year {{that the president of}} the Fairmount Park Art Association (now the Association for Public Art) commissioned Remington to create a large sculpture of a cowboy for Philadelphia's Fairmount Park, which was erected in 1908 on a jutting rock along Kelly Drive – a site Remington specifically chose for the piece after having a horseman pose for him in that exact location. Philadelphia's Cowboy (1908) was Remington's first and only large-scale bronze, and the sculpture is one of the earliest examples of site-specific art in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the initial}} {{interview}} on 30 May 2011, Burke explained on Liveline {{that she had}} [...] "a tape somewhere around but I cant find it, its twelve years old and I don't know {{whether it would be}} viable now". Also, when Burke was asked if she had a tape while being interviewed on [...] on 31 May 2011 by Caitriona Perry, Perry asserted that [...] "despite originally believing that she had a recording of the interview, Helen Lucy Burke is now not so sure". Burke explained, [...] "I don't think so, I thought I had a taped cassette, {{but it turns out that}} it was in the one, I wasn't able to open it because it was a different length from the one in my existing cassette box". When Caitriona Perry asked [...] "do you think you have a tape anywhere else", Burke replied [...] "it could be under the mountains of stuff that came down when my ceiling came in". In the last days of the campaign the tape was released and according to the Irish Independent, Ms. Burke [...] "said yesterday she found the tape recently but only released it in the last days of the campaign for “impact.” She said “it would give people <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> when they went to the polls.|$|E

60|$|Then the {{old woman}} grew uncomfortable too! Only <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it! It was no joke to throw things into the moon! So no more was heard of the club, {{and the next day}} they had all <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b>|$|R
60|$|But she had <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> {{that gave}} her {{a sense of loss}} and a poignant melancholy. Indeed, she had forced her mind to dwell upon the other matters in order to find relief, and she was glad when Thirlwell broke the silence.|$|R

60|$|So Good and I {{went and}} ate {{in silence and}} then indulged in an extra fine flagon of old Zu-Vendian to keep our spirits up, and {{presently}} one of our attendants came and told a story that gave us <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E

60|$|His neglect rankled, {{although}} Bell had <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> He had {{lowered his}} price for coal another shilling, without attracting buyers, and now {{admitted that the}} dales folks' resistance was getting dangerous.

60|$|Supper {{was over}} at the Farnam {{homestead}} and Agatha enjoyed {{the cool of the}} evening on the veranda with her hosts and George.

60|$|Dora did not at {{all like}} Edmund to talk of her being older; but what he had said gave her <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> and she began to reverence the feeling that made Judith Grey choose the rough and ungenial life with the Hewletts, to comfort and sympathy with her friends.|$|E
60|$|But in Naples, it {{may well}} be that Cesare cared nought for these matters, busy and hopeful as he was just then.

60|$|But Reddy Fox didn't {{come again}} in daytime. You see Bowser the Hound {{had given him}} such a scare that he didn't dare to. He {{sometimes}} came at night and sniffed hungrily at Johnny Chuck's doorway, but Johnny and Polly were safe inside, and this didn't trouble them a bit. And Farmer Brown's boy seemed to have forgotten all about the new house. So after a while Johnny Chuck stopped worrying so much. The fact is Johnny Chuck had <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> He had a secret. Yes, Sir, Johnny Chuck had a secret.|$|R
60|$|He {{understood}} why his comrade called Miss Stephen Lucy, {{although he had}} not known her very long.

He thought Lawrence lucky, but was not justified in congratulating him yet, and had <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> Lucy suspected Walters, though Lawrence did not, and Foster imagined that she had some ground for doing so.
