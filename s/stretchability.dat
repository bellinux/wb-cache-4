50|$|Under the {{influence}} of estrogens, cervical mucus becomes abundant, clear, and stretchable, somewhat like egg white. The <b>stretchability</b> of the mucus is described by its spinnbarkeit, from the German word for {{the ability to be}} spun. Only such mucus appears {{to be able to be}} penetrated by sperm. After ovulation, the character of cervical mucus changes, and under {{the influence}} of progesterone it becomes thick, scant, and tacky. Sperm typically cannot penetrate it.|$|E

The front strap is more decorative and <b>stretchability</b> {{is less of a}} concern while the back strap is required to have better stability when stretched. Therefore, the two different straps (front and back) and the ring found on intimate apparel are important to join the functions of the bra strap together.|$|E

With the expectation that there will always be new students that require new swimsuits provided by the school, garments were made from a simple-to-produce shape that has generally remained similar over time, although different types were created made from different materials.|$|E
50|$|Tawing is {{a method}} that uses alum and {{aluminium}} salts, generally {{in conjunction with other}} products such as egg yolk, flour, and other salts. The leather becomes tawed by soaking in a warm potash alum and salts solution, between 20 and 30 °C. The process increases the leather's pliability, <b>stretchability,</b> softness, and quality. Adding egg yolk and flour to the standard soaking solution further enhances its fine handling characteristics. Then, the leather is air dried (crusted) for several weeks, which allows it to stabilize. Tawing is traditionally used on pigskins and goatskins to create the whitest colors. However, exposure and aging may cause slight yellowing over time and, if it remains in a wet condition, tawed leather will suffer from decay. Technically, tawing is not tanning.|$|E

50|$|The {{previous}} {{studies on the}} use of CNTs for textile functionalization were focused on fiber spinning for improving physical and mechanical properties. Recently {{a great deal of attention}} has been focused on coating CNTs on textile fabrics. Various methods have been employed for modifying fabrics using CNTs. produced intelligent e-textiles for Human Biomonitoring using a polyelectrolyte-based coating with CNTs. Additionally, Panhuis et al. dyed textile material by immersion in either a poly (2-methoxy aniline-5-sulfonic acid) PMAS polymer solution or PMAS-SWNT dispersion with enhanced conductivity and capacitance with a durable behavior. In another study, Hu and coworkers coated single-walled carbon nanotubes with a simple “dipping and drying” process for wearable electronics and energy storage applications. In the recent study, Li and coworkers using elastomeric separator and almost achieved a fully stretchable supercapacitor based on buckled single-walled carbon nanotube macrofilms. The electrospun polyurethane was used and provided sound mechanical <b>stretchability</b> and the whole cell achieve excellent charge-discharge cycling stability. CNTs have an aligned nanotube structure and a negative surface charge. Therefore, they have similar structures to direct dyes, so the exhaustion method is applied for coating and absorbing CNTs on the fiber surface for preparing multifunctional fabric including antibacterial, electric conductive, flame retardant and electromagnetic absorbance properties.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{commonly}} used stretchable energy storage device {{is based on}} active materials for double-layer supercapacitors are carbon-based materials such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs),due to their excellent electrical conductivity and high surface areas. The carbon-based materials are also natural choices for stretchable supercapacitors, with proper structural engineering to impart <b>stretchability</b> to the devices. Most recent study by Li et al. shows the fully functionality of the stretchable supercapacitor under dynamic charging and discharging, for the first time, which is composed of both elastic PDMS substrates, buckled SWCNTs macrofilm and elastomeric separators. Although achieving excellent cycling stability, however, the key drawback of this stretchable energy storage based on supercapacitor technology is the low specific capacitance and energy density and this can potentially be improved by the incorporation of redox materials, for example the SWNT/MnO2 electrode. Another approach to creating stretchable energy storage device {{is the use of}} Origami folding principle. The resulting origami battery achieves significant linear and areal deformability, large twistability and bendability.

Finally, we experimentally verify the validity of our equations by fabricating a metal/polymer bilayer thin film based stretchable horseshoe lateral spring structures.

40|$|Problem statement: Boiled white brined (Nabulsi cheese) is {{the mostly}} {{consumed}} in Jordan; this cheese should show meltability and high <b>stretchability</b> {{in order to}} fit {{in the production of}} high quality Kunafa and other popular local sweets and pastries. The most outstanding characteristic of Nabulsi cheese is the long keeping ability (more than one year) without cooling, since it is preserved in concentrated brine (up to 25 %). Approach: This work was based on the hypothesis that {{it would be possible to}} imply meltability and <b>stretchability</b> to the cheese by adjusting pH to the original brine that may specifically act on cross linking bonds of casein. A new apparatus for measuring the actual <b>stretchability</b> was designed and constructed; measurements on different cheeses proved its validity and reliability to measurement <b>stretchability</b> up to 80 cm. Detailed treatments revealed the success of the proposed assumption in inducing meltability and <b>stretchability</b> to cheese processed and preserved according to the traditional methods. Results: The following results were obtained: It is possible to imply a low but acceptable level of <b>stretchability</b> and meltability through adjustment of the pH in the range of 5. 4 - 5. 8 by adding calculated amount of citric acid considering the buffering capacity of the cheese and storing it for few weeks to reach equilibrium. Conclusion: Conformational experiments proved the applicability of the new method on commercial Nabulsi cheese samples.

The customers' requirements for better production ability and thinner films have been becoming more demanding, but their demands are not always met because of lack of film <b>stretchability</b> in the final product. To meet the demands, research on <b>stretchability</b> has been conducted with the goal of finding the optimum polypropylene molecular structure for developing a new product by analyzing stretching force-strain data using a table tenter, which was thought to be the parameter of <b>stretchability.</b> It was found that low crystallinity and wide molecular weight distribution were effective in improving the <b>stretchability</b> from the table tenter test.

40|$|International audienceThis paper proposes an {{efficient}} approach to retarget images based on stretchability-aware block scaling. The image <b>stretchability</b> is first evaluated based on gradient, saliency and color features, {{and is used}} to generate the stretchable space. Then the optimal size of the stretched image is determined under the constraint of stretchable space and the same aspect ratio as the target image. Based on the analysis of image <b>stretchability</b> measures, the original image is partitioned into non-stretchable blocks and stretchable blocks, and their scaling factors are calculated based on their <b>stretchability</b> measures and the stretched image size, in order to possibly preserve non-stretchable blocks without distortion and reasonably resize stretchable blocks.
