There is I {{know not}} what of wild happiness {{of thought and}} expression peculiarly beautiful in the old Scottish song style, of which his Grace, old venerable Skinner, the author of [...] "Tullochgorum," [...] etc., and the late Ross, at Lochlee, of true Scottish poetic memory, are the only modern instances that I recollect, since Ramsay, with his contemporaries, and poor Bob Fergusson, went {{to the world of}} deathless existence and truly immortal song.

5000|$|Bernstein {{says that}} 1966 was “a low {{point in the}} musical course of our century - {{certainly}} the lowest I have ever experienced" [...] (The Unanswered Question p. 419). Although in 1973 his confidence {{about the future of}} classical music had increased, the rise of non-tonal music as a solution to oversaturation of chromaticism was still recent history. These lectures serve as important landmarks in Bernstein’s career, the twentieth century dispute about tonality, and pedagogy for the masses, but relatively little information has been written about them. Often, summaries of the lectures include only brief, positive statements, <b>so</b> a <b>serious</b> discussion <b>about</b> their strengths, weaknesses, and ultimate value to the musical community is in order.|$|R

500|$|Kolbe {{was sent}} to Rome in 1912, where he {{attended}} the Pontifical Gregorian University. He earned a doctorate in philosophy in 1915 there. From 1915 he continued his studies at the Pontifical University of St. Bonaventure where he earned a doctorate in theology in 1919 or 1922 (sources vary). He {{was active in the}} consecration and entrustment to Mary. During his time as a student, he witnessed vehement demonstrations against Popes St. Pius X and Benedict XV in Rome during an anniversary celebration by the Freemasons. According to Kolbe, They placed the black standard of the [...] "Giordano Brunisti" [...] under the windows of the Vatican. On this standard the archangel, St. Michael, was depicted lying under the feet of the triumphant Lucifer. At the same time, countless pamphlets were distributed to the people in which the Holy Father (i.e., the Pope) was attacked shamefully. Soon afterward, Kolbe organized the Militia Immaculatae (Army of the Immaculate One), to work for conversion of sinners and enemies of the Catholic Church, specifically the Freemasons, through the intercession of the Virgin Mary. <b>So</b> <b>serious</b> was Kolbe <b>about</b> this goal that he added to the Miraculous Medal prayer: O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee. And for all those who do not have recourse to thee; especially the Masons and all those recommended to thee.|$|R

While the results are certainly well played, it's extremely difficult {{to figure out exactly}} who Acid Brass is supposed to appeal to, except maybe the kitsch audience." [...] Joshua Klein of The A.V. Club was favourable, saying: [...] "If the musicians weren't <b>so</b> <b>serious</b> <b>about</b> the endeavor, it wouldn't quite work, and as it stands, A Guy Called Gerald's 'Voodoo Ray' sounds pretty silly when played by a marching band. But the arrangements retain much of the simple hookiness of the originals." ...|$|E

He was already an accomplished racer with his old car, but behind the wheel of the Devil Z, Akio is nearly invincible. He is very adaptable and can learn to drive virtually anything.|$|E
