For Men's Basketball, the band is selected from the 57 members of the Men's Basketball Band based upon seniority and instrumentation. All of the instruments are represented except bass guitar, electric guitar, crash cymbals, and tenor drums. Jon Waters conducts the Men's Basketball tournament band. Out {{of the rest of}} the Athletic Band, those with the highest seniority per section are invited to play for the Women's Basketball tournament, directed by Dr. Chris Hoch. Those who do not make that group are invited to perform for the Men's Hockey tournament, directed by one of the graduate assistants. Seniority also assists in picking section leaders, primarily for <b>Spring</b> <b>Band,</b> when the Athletic Band performs a full pre-game and halftime show.

5000|$|In 1857, a {{community}} of Hispanic settlers on Alamosa Creek also became known as Canada Alamosa about 16 miles south of Ojo Caliente, and about 4 {{miles south of the}} downstream end of the canyon. After the town was established leaders of the Chihenne, or Warm <b>Springs</b> <b>band</b> of Apaches made a treaty with the inhabitants of the town, which was allegedly never broken because it provided economic benefit to both the inhabitants of the town and the Chihenne Apaches. [...] Under this treaty a dubious and shadowy trade was carried on, in which the Apaches brought stolen livestock (horses, mules and cattle) along with plundered goods back to Canada Alamosa, although Apache historians would dispute this. These were the spoils taken during wars with settlers and travelers in New Mexico, Arizona and Old Mexico, which were traded for whisky, ammunition and sundry necessities. [...] In 1874 an agency was constructed at Ojo Caliente for the Warm Springs Apaches. In a sudden reversal of policy, this agency was then abolished after 1877 and the Warm <b>Springs</b> <b>band</b> was moved to the San Carlos Reservation. Some of the Warm <b>Springs</b> <b>band</b> refused to accept this transfer, and under war leaders Victorio and Nana entered into a period of continued guerrilla warfare with U.S. and Mexican forces, {{at the end of which}} they either became casualties in scattered conflicts, or were forced to surrender and went into captivity or onto reservations far from the Canada Alamosa area.|$|R
