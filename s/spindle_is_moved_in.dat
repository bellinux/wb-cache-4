40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} methods for making alminate patterns for a resin matrix composite structural component. A {{sheet of paper}} is temporarily adhered to {{a model of the}} structrual component. A pen is positioned on the paper with a spindle touching the model surface opposite the pen. The pen and <b>spindle</b> <b>are</b> <b>moved</b> along the path that maintains the aforementioned contacts. The resulting line traced on paper is a model constant-thickness locus and provides a pattern for a single lamination of resin-impregnated fabric. The steps are repeated to make other patterns and each time the steps are repeated the distance between the tracer and the <b>spindle</b> <b>is</b> changed to correspond to the thickness of a lamination...|$|R
5000|$|A {{micrometer}} ( [...] ), sometimes {{known as}} a micrometer screw gauge, is a device incorporating a calibrated screw widely used for precise measurement of components in mechanical engineering and machining {{as well as most}} mechanical trades, along with other metrological instruments such as dial, vernier, and digital calipers. Micrometers are usually, but not always, in the form of calipers (opposing ends joined by a frame), which is why micrometer caliper is another common name. The <b>spindle</b> <b>is</b> a very accurately machined screw and the object to be measured is placed between the spindle and the anvil. The <b>spindle</b> <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> by turning the ratchet knob or thimble until the object to be measured is lightly touched by both the spindle and the anvil.|$|R
40|$|EP 152564 A UPAB: 19930925 The {{tool holder}} has a motor driving a spindle via bevel gears. A hollow drive shaft (16) {{contains}} a spindle (20) turning {{with it and}} sliding under the action of a mechanism (6) outside the gearbox. The sliding mechanism comprises a control member (12) acting via a component (9) against the end (7) of the inner spindle in opposition to springs (4) between a flange (5) on the spindle and the end face of the hollow shaft. Thus a nut (21) screwed onto {{the other end of}} the inner <b>spindle</b> <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> away from the tool (23). ADVANTAGE - Easy tool changing by unscrewing the nut. 1 /...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a quick {{solution}} {{for measuring the}} volumetric errors of a precision machine is presented. It requires a laser tracker system and a plate including three caves on it. The laser tracker system can detect the coordinate of a sensor ball anywhere in the working space. The plate is fixed on the machine spindle. After installation, the <b>spindle</b> <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> toward the diagonal of the working space. The real movements are along the x, y, and z-axis directions, respectively; it will back to the diagonal line for one complete cycle motion. In each step movement, the <b>spindle</b> <b>is</b> stopped and the laser tracker detects the coordinates of the three caves by putting the target sensor ball into caves sequentially. By means of the coordinates, the volumetric errors at that position can be derived. The overall volumetric errors can be measured quickly by just one setup and many step movements with laser tracker detections...|$|R

"And if this {{which he}} has said be conceded, then Aristotle's {{demonstration}} will be false; because, if {{the proportion of the}} rarity of one medium to the rarity of the other is as the proportion of accidental retardation of the movement in one of them to the retardation occurring to it in the other, and is not as the proportion of the motion itself, it will not follow that what <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> a void would <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> an instant; because in that case there would be subtracted from the motion only the retardation affecting it by reason of the medium, and its natural motion would remain. And every motion involves time; therefore what <b>is</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> a void <b>is</b> necessarily <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> time and with a divisible motion; and nothing impossible will follow.
