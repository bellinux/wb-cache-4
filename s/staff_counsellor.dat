40|$|Australian Universities {{are very}} {{successful}} in attracting large number of international students. A large proportion of University revenue comes from the full fee paying international students. However, {{there have been many}} reports that international students face numerous problems when they arrive in Australia. The common management practice is to provide support staff services to deal with the orientation and welfare of international students. Such service units act as intermediaries between the students and the teaching and learning community of the university. However, the actual experience of international students may be difficult for support <b>staff,</b> <b>counsellors,</b> advisers and academic staff to anticipate. There is little information on the actual experience of students relative to their expectations. This study aimed at securing {{a deeper understanding of the}} contextually relevant issues facing by international students in Australian universities in order to develop management strategies aimed at improved teaching and learning outcomes for international students. Using a highly reliable survey questionnaire, a questionnaire survey was conducted among the international students at Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Brisbane, Australia. About 180 engineering students responded in the survey resulting in a response rate of 81 %. Results indicate that international students face many difficulties including understanding colloquial language, Australian accent, cost of tuition, feelin isolation, safety, security, health services, accommodation and part time jobs. They also face difficulty in coping with learning methods in Australia, particularly in research report writing. However, they are happy with their lecturers and find them very helpful. Many of the students lacked the information regarding various community groups, recreational and sports facilities in Australia before arriving. Findings of the study show that there is a significant gap between the expectation of the students before coming to Australia and actual experience they experience here. Importantly, there is a lack of coordination between international students, international student services (ISS) and university management and as a consequence there have been little improvement in conditions. There is no direct link between student experience and University management. Many important suggestions arisen from this study and most important suggestion is that the student information system should be integrated with the University enterprise resource planning (ERP) to reduce the huge gap between international student expectation and actual experiences...|$|R

40|$|Background Young {{people with}} {{intellectual}} and developmental disability (IDD) get information, education, and support about social and sexual relationships from different sources. Staff are often involved in providing this education and support. We explored if {{and how this}} support is offered to young people transitioning to adulthood. Methods Focus groups were conducted with 17 staff from 3 transition services to illicit information about their experiences providing this education and support. Findings A key theme was that <b>staff</b> are “reluctant <b>counsellors.</b> ” Although <b>staff</b> provided social and sexual education, they reported being underprepared and relied primarily on their own values as guidance. They did this in full recognition that transition services filled a social gap for participants, blurring the lines between education and social support.

40|$|Background Efforts to {{increase}} access to life-saving treatment, including antiretroviral therapy (ART), for {{people living with}} HIV/AIDS in resource-limited settings has been the growing focus of international efforts. One {{of the greatest challenges}} to scaling up will be the limited supply of adequately trained human resources for health, including doctors, nurses, pharmacists and other skilled providers. As national treatment programmes are planned, better estimates of human resource needs and improved approaches to assessing the impact of different staffing models are critically needed. However there have been few systematic assessments of staffing patterns in existing programmes or of the estimates being used in planning larger programmes. Methods We reviewed the published literature and selected plans and scaling-up proposals, interviewed experts and collected data on staffing patterns at existing treatment sites through a structured survey and site visits. Results We found a wide range of staffing patterns and patient-provider ratios in existing and planned treatment programmes. Many factors influenced health workforce needs, including task assignments, delivery models, other staff responsibilities and programme size. Overall, the number of health care workers required to provide ART to 1000 patients included 1 – 2 physicians, 2 – 7 nurses, < 1 to 3 pharmacy staff, and a much wider range of counsellors and treatment supporters. We estimate from these data that the equivalent of 20 000 to 100 000 physicians, nurses, pharmacists and other core clinical staff will be needed to meet the WHO target of treating 3 million people by the end of 2005. The total number of <b>staff,</b> including <b>counsellors,</b> administrators and other cadres, could be substantially higher. Discussion These data are consistent with other estimates of human resource requirements for antiretroviral therapy, but highlight the considerable variability of current staffing models and the importance of a broad range of factors in determining personnel needs. Few outcome or cost data are currently available to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of different staffing models, and it will be important to develop improved methods for gathering this information as treatment programmes are scaled up...|$|R
40|$|Community {{mental health}} teams (CMHT) {{are one of}} the most common and {{long-established}} forms for delivering comprehensive mental healthcare. Their origins were both pragmatic (in the UK) and ideological (France and Italy), and they serve to ensure an effective multidisciplinary approach to the assessment and care of mental illness. In most countries they are restricted to the care of the severely mentally ill. This contribution covers their structure and staffing and relates it to their function. Most serve populations of 20 000 - 60 000 and contain psychiatrists, nurses and often social workers. Other disciplines include psychology and occupational therapy, and increasingly more specialist members (e. g. vocational <b>counsellors).</b> <b>Staffing</b> norms vary enormously but the UK proposals are outlined, along with mechanisms to establish thresholds and coordination of care. Leadership issues and the tensions between generic and specialist working are common in these teams. Effective internal communication and external liaison and clarity about an agreed operational policy are fundamental determinants of success. CMHTs are currently under criticism and many more specialized teams are being established. It remains to be seen to what extent they can be replaced and to what extent these specialized teams augment their persisting practice. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|School {{acknowledges}} that {{a goal of}} the Catholic school is that students should learn about their value as human persons {{from the time they}} enter a Catholic school community. This principle must influence every level of the school’s life so that students learn about their own dignity and value as a human person. The care and attention they receive from all within the school should help them realise these fundamental principles. Every staff member, when accepting a position at St Peter’s, shares responsibility for the pastoral care of students. In addition, by accepting a position in the school they are also accepting the role of teacher/educator or “one who helps to form human persons”. In a Catholic school the Principal has the ultimate responsibility for this care along with the assistance of specially trained <b>staff</b> such as <b>counsellors</b> and social workers. Catholic schools are entrusted, in partnership with parents/guardians/caregivers who are the primary educators of their children, with the total education of the child.

Staff discharge this duty by taking reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which they can reasonably foresee would be likely to result in harm or injury to the student. Definition...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{progress}} report on a pilot peer-mentoring programme for staff at a tertiary institution. Ako Ako is a Maori methodology of learning that acknowledges that both partners share the power base of teaching and learning. Peer mentoring replicates this methodology and requires a paradigm shift from traditional mentoring where one is deemed to {{have higher levels of}} knowledge and skills. In this process the group engages in an exchange of knowledge and skills to enhance professional practice. Although mentoring was occurring within the institute, no formal structure was in place. A need was established and a framework to support staff in the mentoring process was implemented. Success experienced in an overseas experiment prompted our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to encourage and support the implementation of peer mentoring. A working party, of a Nursing tutor, <b>Staff</b> Development Co-ordinator, <b>Counsellor</b> and a Computing tutor was formed to investigate the implementation of a mentoring programme. A private consultancy firm was contracted to provide the initial training. During the first year 10 % of staff participated in the pilot programme. Participants reported that peer mentoring and the cross-pollination of experiences across different divisions of the institution supported their professional development by increasing and expanding ideas, providing broader perspectives and validating experiences. Tutors were able to include these into their own teaching practice whether it be in computing, nursing, art or any other discipline. During the second year there was a decline in the participation rate as restructuring and audit factors impacted on staff time and resources...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{comprehensive}} picture of the nature and outcomes of counselling in secondary schools in the UK. Audit and evaluation studies of schools counselling were identified using a systematic literature search. Thirty studies were found and analysed using a variety of methods. Typically, counselling services provided purely person-centred, or person-centred-based, forms of therapy. Averaged across all studies, clients had a mean age of 13. 86 and attended for 6. 35 sessions of counselling. The average percentage of female clients per study was 56. 31 %. Most frequently, clients presented with family issues, with anger issues particularly prevalent in males. Around 60 % of clients began counselling with 'abnormal' or borderline levels of psychological distress. Counselling was associated with large improvements in mental health (mean weighted effect size = 0. 81), with around 50 % of clinically distressed clients demonstrating clinical improvement. On average, just over 80 % of respondents rated counselling as moderately or very helpful, with teachers giving it a mean rating of 8. 22 on a 10 -point scale of helpfulness. For clients, the most helpful aspect of counselling was the opportunity to talk and be listened to, while pastoral care <b>staff</b> emphasised the <b>counsellor's</b> independence, expertise and confidentiality. There were some indications that counselling may indirectly benefit students' capacities to study and learn. School-based counselling appears to be of considerable benefit to young people in the UK, but there is a need for this finding to be verified through controlled trials...|$|R
40|$|Higher Education {{institutions}} have, in {{the framework}} of the Bologna Process, been called to re-define their degree programmes {{on the basis of the}} learning outcomes approach. This implies a change of paradigm moving from teacher-centred to student-centred education. The Tuning project was set-up in 2000 to develop — through a bottom-up approach — a methodology to achieve this shift. This methodology proved not only to be relevant for Europe, but also for other world regions, including the USA, where Tuning projects were launched from 2009. In 2010 both in the EU and the USA the need was felt to find out whether the intended modernization of learning was actually taking place and how this process was perceived by its main stakeholders. For this purpose a study was initiated, covering the period 2011 to the beginning of 2016, based on the two-pillar approach of quantitative and qualitative instruments. For the study a robust evaluation instrument was developed, consisting of surveys and in-depth interviews implemented by a research team at a selected group of Higher Education institutions, involving management, teaching <b>staff,</b> student <b>counsellors</b> and students. In this paper the outcomes of the EU part of the study are presented, cross referencing to some of the USA study results. The main outcome of the study is that in general limited progress has been made regarding the intended paradigm shift and that key expectations of the reform Process have not been met. This is both the case for Europe and the USA. Although, good practices have been identified, the actual implementation of the student-centred approach is not proceeding beyond a discourse on the paradigm shift and there is no certainty it will be achieved. For Europe there is also a worrying disconnect between the various tiers of the HE sector, ranging from Ministers to students, regarding the actual penetration of the student-centred approach and the education experience of the students. There has been a failure to engage with and convince academic staff about the necessity and advantages of this paradigm shift. Teaching staff are struggling to adjust to the new concepts and paradigm shift and are challenged by no longer being the “knowledge owners” but rather learning facilitators. It does not help that the vast majority of staff members have not undertaken professional development for HE teaching. Where staff development has taken place, it is too focused on process, rather than the concepts and benefits of a learning outcomes approach. The outcomes of the study should therefore be perceived as a wake-up call because without additional and continued support in particular for the teaching staff the reform process could fail...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In Cambodia, {{nearly half}} of {{pregnant}} women attend antenatal care (ANC), which is an entry point of services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). However, most of ANC services are provided in health centres or fields, where laboratory services by technicians are not available. In this study, those voluntary confidential counselling and testing (VCCT) counsellors involved in PMTCT were trained by experienced laboratory technicians in our centre on HIV testing using Determine (Abbot Laboratories) HIV 1 / 2 test kits through a half-day training course, which consisted of use of a pipette, how to process whole blood samples, and how to read test result. The trained counsellors were midwives working for ANC and delivery ward in our centre without any experience on laboratory works. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the feasibility of the training by evaluating the proficiency of the trained non-laboratory <b>staffs.</b> The trained <b>counsellors</b> withdrew blood sample after pre-test counselling following ANC, and performed the rapid test. Laboratory technicians routinely did the same test and returned reports of the test results to counsellors. Reports by the counsellors and the laboratory technicians were compared, and discordant reports in two groups were re-tested with the same rapid test kit using the same blood sample. Cause of discordance was detected in discussion with both groups. Of 563 blood samples tested by six trained VCCT counsellors and three laboratory technicians, 11 samples (2. 0 %) were reported positive in each group, however four discordant reports (0. 7 %) between the groups were observed, in which two positive reports and two negative reports by the counsellors were negative and positive by the laboratory technicians, respectively. Further investigation confirmed that all the reports by the counsellors were correct, and that human error in writing reports in the laboratory was a cause of these discordant reports. These findings lead us the conclusion that the half-day training using the rapid and simple test was feasible for non-laboratory staffs to attain enough proficiency to implement VCCT services for PMTCT in resource-limited settings, and that human error was more likely to occur in laboratory before giving reports to counsellors. </p...|$|R
40|$|Since May 2008 (following the {{spate of}} young people {{apparently}} taking their lives within one local authority in Wales) Talk to me, the national action plan to reduce suicide and self harm in Wales 2009 - 2014 (WAG, 2009) promoted a strategic approach to developing targets for a reduction in suicide. The current research aimed to add to existing literature and research to help inform a major incident response plan to reduce suicide and suicide attempts. The study involved a single case relating to a critical incident {{that took place in}} one local authority in Wales during 2008 and 2009 involving a suicide cluster. Information gathered from professionals from three organisations involved in the critical incident response included school <b>staff,</b> school <b>counsellors</b> and educational psychologists. Data were collected through group interviews. The methodology was qualitative in nature which investigated the interaction between the various agencies to the critical incident and levels of responding in terms of the processes and procedures that were followed at the time. An analysis was undertaken firstly, in the form of grounded theory, which allowed theory to emerge from the data. In addition soft systems methodology was utilised to develop a rich picture based on the experiences of those organisations involved in the critical incident response. The expected outcome was that the current research will help improve effective collaborative responses to a critical incident in one local authority in Wales, which will lead to a decrease in referrals to agencies as a result of early intervention approaches and appropriate referrals. The current research was an exploratory study which gathered rich data that may help with early intervention. At a wider level it was considered that the findings of the research may provide greater understanding of and insight into the dynamics of inter-agency co-operation in critical incidents, which may inform future protocols, procedures and policies at regional and national level. From the grounded theory analysis, categories emerged which were interpreted though relevant psychological theory. The analysis showed that there was a difference in the way school staff, educational psychologists and counsellors’ responded to the critical incident. No new theory emerged from the grounded theory analysis possibly due to methodological limitations and a small sample size. A number of key change issues were extrapolated through SSM, including three issue based systems and one primary task. The future plan, as outlined in stage 6 of SSM, is for feasible and desirable changes to current systems to be debated between the senior management within the three organisations. There were a number of limitations to the current study, particularly with respect to the grounded theory data collection and data analysis. The use of an abbreviated version of grounded theory may have reduced the breadth of analysis as there was no iterative process in the data collection. The socially sensitive nature of the study prevented the researcher from reporting participants’ verbatim; this may have prevented others from interpreting the data. One positive aspect of the design was that the group may have acted as a debriefing. Throughout the study every effort was made to overcome any potential barriers that the researcher’s status as an educational psychologist in the local authority may have had on the research process. In the current study, implications for educational psychology practice have been identified when supporting schools during a critical incident response. The study highlights the importance of increased educational psychologist involvement in emergency planning at different levels and identifies the need to enhance psychological support and training offered to school staff. The current research suggests that greater multi-agency collaboration and communication is required during a critical incident response. There is a need for additional empirical research to inform future critical incident response. Finally, continued development of an integrated model of crisis response for school psychologists is paramount...|$|R
40|$|Magister Public Health - MPHBreastfeeding {{impacts on}} the health of both the mother and infant and has been noted as being {{influenced}} by physiological, physical, socio-economic and environmental factors. The undisputed benefit of exclusive breastfeeding for both the mother and child has led to the global prioritisation of the promotion, protection and support of breastfeeding with the adoption of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) strategy. Baby Friendly Hospital (BFH) status is awarded to a maternity unit when they are found to be complying with set criteria Ten Steps to successful Breastfeeding. South Africa has implemented a re-evaluation system for retention of accreditation status, by reassessing accredited facilities every three years. The respective provinces are tasked with monitoring the implementation of BFHI in their public health facilities. Internal monitoring reports, completed by the Western Cape Provincial Department of Health, reflect erosion of key steps between national reassessments. Aim: To describe the experiences, challenges and successes of BFHI implementation in the BFH accredited facilities in the Cape Town geographical health district. Methodology: An explorative qualitative study was conducted. One key informant interview, ten in-depth interviews with champions for BFHI in the maternity facilities and two focus group discussions with frontline staff working at these facilities were used to collect data. The data was analysed using thematic content analysis to identify the main themes related to the successes and challenges experienced with the maintenance of the required practices related to BFHI accreditation. Results: Participants reported that the implementation of the BFHI impacted positively {{on the health of}} both mothers and infants. Fewer children were being admitted for common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea subsequent  to BFHI implementation. Mothers were recovering more quickly after delivery and less complications related to delivery, such as postpartum bleeding, were observed after the implementation of BFHI. BFHI implementation had a positive impact on the attitudes of maternity staff to breastfeeding promotion, protection and support. Subsequent to being awarded BFH status, facilities are tasked with maintaining the implemented practices. Challenges to maintaining the practices included lack of implementation of BFHI practices at clinics, lack of support from facility managers and support <b>staff</b> such as <b>counsellors.</b> The internal assessments implemented as supportive monitoring structures are considered by participants to be a demotivating process and concerns were raised about non nursing staff assessing nursing practices. Conclusion: The potential impact of this strategy on infant and maternal health must be realized by the implementers of BFHI, before the strategized aim is achieved. Co-ordination and support by all role players is vital to the success and elimination of challenges experienced with implementation and maintenance of the BFH strategy. South Afric...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Depression {{is common}} and can have devastating {{effects on the}} life of adolescents. Prevention {{programmes}} in adolescent depression have been designed mainly in developed countries. In Chile, research on this topic is just beginning. Objectives: This study aimed to design and evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and acceptability of a school-based, universal psychological intervention, to prevent depression in low-income, secondary school students in Santiago, Chile. The findings of this study could assist in improving the design and implementation of a major project, involving 22 schools and more than 2, 500 students. Methodology: This study consisted of three parts: (1) formative research, (2) a cluster randomised controlled trial, and (3) a qualitative study. (1) Formative research was carried out before the design of the intervention and the implementation of the project. This was achieved in four state funded schools by using semi-structured interviews of key school staff and focus groups with students, teachers and parents. The analysis of the results was phenomenological and by categories. (2) A cluster randomised controlled trial was carried out with schools as the main clusters. The intervention group was compared with a control group in a study involving three state funded schools, seven Grade 9 classes, and 277 students. Students in the active group attended 11 weekly sessions of an intervention based on cognitive behavioural theory developed specifically for this study. Each session was designed for a class of 40 to 45 students. Two facilitators delivered each workshop. Eight young professionals participated in the study (six psychologists, one occupational therapist and one physician). The control group received one curricular hour of counselling each week, from the head teacher. The measures were applied at the baseline assessment, {{at the end of the}} intervention and six months after the intervention. The primary outcome measure used was the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Two secondary outcomes were evaluated: Children's Automatic Thought Questionnaire (CATS) and Social Problem Solving Inventory-Revised Short Form (SPSI-RS). For evaluating the efficacy of the intervention in: reducing depressive symptoms, reducing dysfunctional thoughts, and improving strategies to solve problems among students, the analyses consisted of a repeated measures regression model, adjusting for baseline score of each scale. For evaluating the efficacy of the intervention in preventing new cases of depression among students, the analysis consisted of a multi-level logistic regression model, adjusting for age and gender. A BDI-II score of < 20 at baseline, was used as criterion for inclusion in the analysis. This is a cut-off score to discriminate clinically significant depressive symptoms from good sensitivity and specificity. Analyses and presentations of data were in accordance with CONSORT guidelines. Analyses were performed using STATA software (version 10. 0). (3) A qualitative study, consisting in four focus groups was carried out after the intervention. Four girls and four boys from each class of the active group were randomly assigned to participate in each focus group. All the interview sessions of the focus groups were recorded and later transcribed. A qualitative analysis of the contents using the ATLAS. ti (version 5. 0) software data was carried out. The Ethics Committee, Hospital Clínico Universidad de Chile, granted approval. Students and their parents were informed of the study and dual consent was sought. Evaluation was carried out only on those students who have the approval oftheir parents and have given their assent. However, all students of the active group participated in the intervention, as it was carried out during class times. Results: (1) Formative research: According to the opinion of key school <b>staff</b> (headmasters and <b>counsellors),</b> students, teachers and parents depression is a problem that must be evaluated and treated. They approved and expressed their willingness to the existence of a school-based prevention programme to prevent depression. Key school staff thought that is difficult to involve parents in a programme such as this. (2) Cluster randomised controlled trial: Participants were 163 in the active group and 114 in the control group. The mean age of the sample was 14. 5 years (SD= 6). In the baseline assessment the active group did not differ significantly from the control group regarding age, level of depressive symptoms, level of dysfunctional thoughts and level of problem solving strategies. There was significant difference in terms of gender. There was a greater percentage of females in the intervention group, than in the control group (51. 5 % vs. 27. 2 %). In the active group, the BDI-II score was initially 10. 7 (95 % CI= 9. 0 to 12. 4), which increased at the end of the intervention to 11. 5 (95 % CI= 9. 7 to 13. 4) and at the 6 months assessment was 9. 2 (95 % CI= 7. 5 to 10. 9). In the control group, the BDI-II mean score was 9. 2 (95 % CI= 7. 6 to 10. 8), 8. 0 (95 % CI= 6. 3 to 9. 6) and 8. 6 (95 % CI= 6. 1 to 11. 1), respectively. No significant group effects were found for depressive symptoms, dysfunctional thoughts or solving problems strategies at post-intervention and at 6 -month follow-up controlling by baseline scores. However, when evaluating the efficacy of the intervention in the prevention of new cases of depression at 6 -month follow-up, the intervention behaved like a protective factor against depression (OR=. 39; Cl 95 %=. 19 to. 79). (3) Qualitative study: Participants appraised the programme positively. They found group work methodology successful. They attributed great importance to disciplinary control during sessions and to the relationship established with the facilitators. The most significant learning was related to the technique of solving problems. The prevention programme environment was also related as an instance of communication and improvement of interpersonal relationships within the classes. Conclusions: Formative research was a useful tool in the development and implementation of the research and provided the necessary inputs to design and to implement the intervention to prevent depression. In the randomised controlled tria!, no follow-up group effects were significant on primary and secondary outcomes. The lack of effect could reflect a 'floor effect', because of the low depressive symptoms at baseline assessment.
