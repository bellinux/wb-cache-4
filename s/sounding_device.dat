50|$|Seabed gouging by ice is an eminently {{discreet}} phenomenon: {{little sign}} {{of it can}} be observed from above the water surface - the odd evidence includes sea floor sediments incorporated into the ice. Information of interest on these gouges includes: depth, width, length and orientation. Gouging frequency - the number of gouges produced at a given location per unit time - is another important parameter. This kind of information has been gathered by means of seabed mapping with ship-borne instrumentation, typically a fathometer: echo <b>sounding</b> <b>devices</b> such as a side-scan and a multi-beam sonar systems.

40|$|This {{work was}} {{supported}} by award RC- 2154 from the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program and funding from the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Atlantic and NOAA Fisheries, Southeast Region. Active echo <b>sounding</b> <b>devices</b> are often employed for commercial or scientific purposes in the foraging habitats of marine mammals. We conducted an experiment off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, USA, to assess whether the behavior of short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) changed when exposed to an EK 60 scientific echo sounder. We attached digital acoustic recording tags (DTAGs) to nine individuals, five of which were exposed. A hidden Markov model to characterize diving states with and without exposure provided no evidence {{for a change in}} foraging behavior. However, generalized estimating equations to model changes in heading variance over the entire tag record under all experimental conditions showed a consistent increase in heading variance during exposure over all values of depth and pitch. This suggests that regardless of behavioral state, the whales changed their heading more frequently when the echo sounder was active. This response could represent increased vigilance in which whales maintained awareness of echo sounder location by increasing their heading variance and provides the first quantitative analysis on reactions of cetaceans to a scientific echo sounder.

In 1927, she was put on the NorwayHamburg route, replacing SS Neptun and SS Mira. A new heating system was installed in 1913 and wireless radio in 1914. Irma had a new streamlined rudder put in place in 1928. In 1931, she joined the Hurtigruten route in Norway, replacing SS Hera after the latter's shipwreck in March that year. Irma was rebuilt that year and once again the year after that. In a series of upgrades she received a refrigeration system in 1933, improved navigational equipment in 1938 and an echo <b>sounding</b> <b>device</b> in 1939. Irma was a very popular ship amongst her passengers, with her smoking salon receiving particular praise. She had only one serious accident in the pre-war years, which occurred when she hit a reef off Kabelvåg in the Lofoten islands in 1937.

2500|$|Among {{the notable}} discoveries {{linked to the}} ship was the {{definition}} of bathymetry proving an unexpected {{at the time and}} unusual feature of the United States continental slope, now named for the ship as the Blake Plateau. Initial findings of such a plateau were found in June 1880 during investigations of the Gulf Stream. During her first survey season, starting in June 1874, George S.

40|$|When {{studying}} channel {{properties in}} cellular networks two key parameters are the delay spread {{and the type}} of fading. The delay spread holds information about the time dispersion the channel induces, whereas the effect the channel has on the power of propagating waves is reflected in the fading. Line-of-sight communications results in Rician fading whereas non-line-of- sight means Rayleigh fading. Measurements and classification of channel environments have, to the writer's knowledge, so far only been done with the use of complex <b>sounding</b> <b>devices.</b> In this work, channel classification is performed using low-level data from a regular cell phone. Measurements were performed with a real cell phone in a controlled milieu where different radio environments were emulated. With the use of channel estimates from the cell phone, probability density function parameter estimations were performed with both maximum likelihood and method of moments techniques. The Rician K-factor, which expresses the ratio of line- of-sight components to scattered waves, was calculated with the results from the estimation. The K-factor calculations showed, as expected, obvious differences between various simulated environments. The K-factor increases with stronger line-of- sight component, which is in line with theory. For weak direct waves, the estimate often becomes zero which is due to the difficulty of detecting a weak direct wave in lots of scattered waves. To achieve better results, other estimation techniques might therefore be necessary. For repeated measurements with the same settings the variance of the K- factor estimates is quite high. Also, the variance increases with stronger direct wave. This might be due to additive noise during measurement. The mean of the K-factor estimates seems to be 3 dB higher than expected. This offset is possibly due to the difference in the noise power between complex and real noise, which is exactly 3 dB, or internal differences in the power level of the channel simulator. The reason for the difference is not clear but power measurements confirms it. With compensation for this, the calculated K-factors aligns much better to the expected K-factors. Although they are not exactly the same, they are so close that with further studies, classification of radio channels with the use of cell phone channel estimates should be possible.

40|$|A problem {{frequently}} {{present in}} {{the oil and gas}} industry is the difficulty of measuring well integrity parameters; particularly, for high-pressure high-temperature wells. For this reason, many relevant parameters, indicators of the integrity of the well, are not directly measured but rather qualitatively estimated by testing response variables, sometimes, unfortunately, without understanding the correlation between the key parameter and the response variable. This research presents methodologies to quantitatively evaluate well integrity in wells with sustained casing pressure (SCP) and gas-lifted wells with faulty gas-lift valves (GLV). The phenomenon occurring during these well integrity issues were modeled using the thermodynamic properties and transport phenomena occurring inside the wellbore. Well integrity denotes the ability to maintain intentional isolation between the formation and the well. The consequences of not detecting and managing well integrity issues can go from the activation of rupture discs to a release of oil/gas, fire and/or explosion during a blowout. For the SCP problem, the developed analytic model has been validated against field data and compared to other numerical models showing similar performance. The SCP model allows for early time data to be used to accurately predict the leak?s severity by estimating a seepage factor, which is akin to permeability, to account for leakage occurring through the imperfect cement sheath. In comparison to current practices, the model shortens the testing time and reduces the risk from gas accumulation and pressure buildup, making it an inherently safer testing procedure. The methodology developed to assess wellbore annular integrity, during gas-lift operations, has been compared to acoustic well sounding (AWS) data from different wells. The model divides the well into small elements and estimates average properties which are used to quantify the total amount of mass and hydrostatic pressure in the annulus at any given time. This methodology accurately tracks casinghead pressure and liquid level increase. When fluid intrusion occurs mostly through the gas-lift valve, the model allows estimating the damage coefficient of the faulty GLV. This coefficient serves as a quantitative parameter for GLV replacement; being independent of acoustic well <b>sounding</b> <b>devices.</b> This methodology has the advantages of easy and quick implementation, being accurate, not requiring any specialized equipment, and providing a quantitative damage parameter for the GLV...|$|R
