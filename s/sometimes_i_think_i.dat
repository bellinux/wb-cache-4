25|$|Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I {{tipped his}} bat several {{times when he}} had two strikes on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out. He got even, though. One time there were two strikes on him and he swung as the pitch was coming in. But he didn't swing at the ball. He swung right at my wrists. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can still feel the pain. I'll tell you I didn't tip his bat again. No, sir, not until the last {{game of the season}} and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat again and got away with it.|$|E
60|$|Why comest thou then so slowly? Because I am hindered. What hinders? Has God {{forbidden}} thee? No. Art thou {{not willing}} to come faster? Yes, yet I cannot. Well, prithee be plain with me, and tell me the reason and ground of thy discouragement. Why, says the sinner, though God forbids me not, and though I am willing to come faster, yet there naturally ariseth this, and that, and the other thought in my heart, that hinders my speed to Jesus Christ. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am not chosen; <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am not called; <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am come too late; and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know not {{what it is to}} come. Also one while I think I have no grace; and then again, that I cannot pray; and then again, I think that I am a very hypocrite. And these things keep me from coming to Jesus Christ.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{what people}} say--but I don't know. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{have no right}} to any part of it. You have to earn what you own, don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, Sam. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{have done}} very well, {{and then again}} I am afraid that I missed a great many things. How did you make out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, Ellen. That's {{what makes}} it so kind of awful. I can't tell whether it's a real fancy, or <b>I</b> only <b>think</b> it is. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> so because <b>I</b> am afraid to believe it. Do you under Ellen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why so?" [...] he asked, with bitter disappointment. [...] "Ayesha, {{those parts}} have been mine for many a day; more, I grow no younger, and, unlike thee, shall soon be old. Also, life is fleeting, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> near its end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{one could}} do it," [...] she admitted. [...] "I {{was not made}} for domesticity. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> was not made to be wife to any man. I am a gambler at heart. I love the fierce {{draughts}} of life. Without them I should die." ...|$|R

6000|$|The priest {{looked away}} into the darkness, and his voice was low and hoarse. [...] "You {{do not know what}} you ask!" [...] he said. [...] "No, I shall not tell you yet.

6000|$|... "Rich or not, I never thought; but {{it looks}} so happy, I can't tell how; and it is so far away. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> do but dream it is there. You should see it in a sunset." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may {{imagine what}} it is! These two years that I have been here I have passed hours--hours! One gets used to things, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have got used to this. But {{there are some things}} that are always {{beginning}} over again.

6000|$|... "Oh, {{you don't}} help me. Why aren't you ever serious? If only you knew how miserable I am sometimes, {{thinking}} it's not right. Perhaps, you know, {{there is a}} hell, and all that.

6000|$|... "I don't know, Rose; <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> get {{a little}} onward. But it is sweeter--yes, much sweeter, I find--to have you walking on this path here than to be {{treading}} it alone." ...|$|R
60|$|I owe the {{fullness}} {{and variety of}} my life to this restlessness of mine, for I have repeatedly left comfortable homes in order to follow some perfect stranger who looked as if he were on his way to somewhere interesting. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> must have cat blood in me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's very satisfying.' But Mabella was {{scarcely}} comfortable under his answer, even though jestingly returned, and she added: 'But <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> may, {{just for the}} fun of it. Now we'll steer across to her, and catch her, and I'll introduce you. But we shall never get to her at this rate!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Caroline did {{not seem}} vexed by the inquiry, but went on {{speaking}} rather {{as if she was}} examining herself as to the answer,--"Love him?

6000|$|There was {{a general}} laugh, but Wilson said manfully, [...] "Very well, Mrs. Doolan; I am very fond of youngsters, and I should like to take, anyhow, the two eldest out <b>sometimes.</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> should make much hand with the other two, but perhaps Richards {{would like to come}} in and amuse them while we are out; he is just the fellow for young ones." ...|$|R
6000|$|She went on: [...] "No, I don't {{blame you}} or any one for {{avoiding}} me. But I {{wish they would}} let me {{have one or two}} friends. But they won't.
