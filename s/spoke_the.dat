5|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Ireland they were stranded far outside {{the protection of}} the Norse–Gaelic longphorts. The ship was attacked by local Irishmen, despite the efforts of Olaf, who <b>spoke</b> <b>the</b> Gaelic, to negotiate safe passage with them.|$|E
5|$|Among the Betsimisaraka, like {{several other}} Malagasy ethnic groups, {{there is a}} fady against {{speaking}} {{the name of a}} chief after his death or any word that formed part of the name. The deceased leader was given a new name after death that all were required to use and specific synonyms were selected to replace the words composing his name for use in regular conversation; anyone who <b>spoke</b> <b>the</b> forbidden words would be harshly punished or in some instances executed.|$|E
50|$|For bicycle <b>spokes,</b> <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> {{length is}} defined from the flange {{seat to the}} thread tip. For spokes with bent ends, <b>the</b> nominal <b>spoke</b> length {{does not include the}} width of <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> at <b>the</b> bent end.|$|R
40|$|The radial, lateral, and {{tangential}} {{stiffness of}} spoked bicycle wheels {{depends upon the}} rim’s bending inertia, torsional inertia, <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> sizes, and <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> geometry. <b>The</b> <b>spokes</b> of three rear bicycle wheels of different spoke patterns were instrumented with strain gauges in order to investigate the effect of <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> pattern on <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> strain and fatigue resistance properties of <b>the</b> wheels. <b>Spoke</b> strains due to radial loads were measured in the laboratory. Time-records of the strain of a right pulling spoke were collected {{from each of the}} wheels under actual riding conditions. Analytical, numerical, laboratory, and field studies show that spoke strains due to radial loads and in service conditions are insensitive to <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> pattern. Small variations in <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> strains between <b>the</b> wheels in the road tests can be attributed to variations in the loads, but do not significantly affect the fatigue life of the wheels...|$|R
50|$|A {{traditional}} {{type of line}} tag, sometimes {{played in}} snow, is Fox and geese. The fox starts at the centre of a <b>spoked</b> wheel, and <b>the</b> geese flee from the fox along <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> and around <b>the</b> wheel. Geese that are tagged become foxes. The intersections of <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> with <b>the</b> wheel are safe zones.|$|R
5|$|Carpentier was {{influenced}} {{by a number of}} authors. Jean Price Mars's Ainsi parla l'oncle (So <b>Spoke</b> <b>the</b> Uncle) presents two arguments that Carpentier applied to his historical approach: firstly, {{from the perspective of a}} Haitian peasant, the Revolution did nothing more than replace leaders, since the exploitation continued; secondly, Price Mars assumes the authenticity of the belief in African gods, in contrast with a shallow Catholicism. William Seabrook's The Magic Island made connections between religion and history and was considered a beautiful book by Carpentier.|$|E

5|$|The {{people of}} Yamhad were Amorites and <b>spoke</b> <b>the</b> Amorite language, {{and apart from}} a few Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Aegean influences, Yamhad belonged mainly to middle Bronze Age Syrian culture.

5000|$|The hub flanges {{of modern}} tension-spoked bicycle wheels are always spaced wider than where <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> attach to <b>the</b> rim. When viewed in cross section, <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> and hub form a triangle, a {{structure}} that is stiff both vertically and laterally. In three dimensions, if <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> were covered, they would form two cones or [...] "dishes". The greater the separation between the hub flanges, the deeper the dishes, and the stiffer and stronger the wheel can be laterally. The more vertical <b>the</b> <b>spokes,</b> <b>the</b> shallower the dish, and the less stiff the wheel will be laterally.|$|R

5|$|Modern {{linguists}} divide Celtic languages {{into two}} major groups: the P-Celtic, {{from which the}} Brythonic languages– Welsh, Breton, Cornish and Cumbric derive– and the Q-Celtic, from which come the Goidelic languages– Irish, Manx and Gaelic. The Pictish language remains enigmatic, since the Picts had no written script {{of their own and}} all that survives are place names and some isolated inscriptions in Irish ogham script. Most modern linguists accept that, although the nature and unity of Pictish language is unclear, it belonged to the former group. Historical sources, as well as place-name evidence, indicate {{the ways in which the}} Pictish language in the north and Cumbric languages in the south were overlaid and replaced by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse in this period. By the High Middle Ages the majority of people within Scotland <b>spoke</b> <b>the</b> Gaelic language, then simply called Scottish, or in Latin, lingua Scotica.|$|E
5|$|On November 14, 2015, {{the candle}} was lit {{nearly two weeks}} prior to the {{official}} ceremony date after local resident Joe Mercado posted to an Easton, Pennsylvania Facebook community page asking to light the candle to show support {{for the people of}} Paris, France after a terrorist attack the day before.

5|$|The Anatolian peninsula, {{comprising}} most {{of modern}} Turkey, {{is one of}} the oldest permanently settled regions in the world. Various ancient Anatolian populations have lived in Anatolia, from at least the Neolithic period until the Hellenistic period. Many of these peoples <b>spoke</b> <b>the</b> Anatolian languages, a branch of the larger Indo-European language family. In fact, given the antiquity of the Indo-European Hittite and Luwian languages, some scholars have proposed Anatolia as the hypothetical centre from which the Indo-European languages radiated. The European part of Turkey, called Eastern Thrace, has also been inhabited since at least forty thousand years ago, and is known to have been in the Neolithic era by about 6000 BC.|$|E
50|$|One {{end of each}} spoke is {{threaded}} for a specialized nut, called a nipple, {{which is used to}} connect <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> to <b>the</b> rim and adjust the tension in <b>the</b> <b>spoke.</b> This is normally at the rim end. The hub end normally has a 90 degree bend to pass through <b>the</b> <b>spoke</b> hole in <b>the</b> hub, and a head so it does not slip through the hole.|$|R

5|$|The cast filmed {{the pilot}} in 1987. Papps' casting was {{announced}} {{ahead of the}} series debut. The series first aired on 17 January 1988 on the Seven Network. Frank was the first character to appear, although a Police officer (Bruce Venables) <b>spoke</b> <b>the</b> first piece of dialogue. Frank was played by Bradley Pilato in the scene, which was set in 1978 as a young Frank tries {{to escape from the}} Police officer. The series then switches to 1988, where Frank is one of five foster children alongside Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson), Steven Matheson (Adam Willits), Lynn Davenport (Helena Bozich) and Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie). Tom loses his job in the city and moves the Fletcher family to the town of Summer Bay.|$|E
5|$|Lured by {{numerous}} incentives {{such as food}} coupons, better housing and other benefits, they were received coldly by the Armenians living in the Republic upon their arrival. The repatriates <b>spoke</b> <b>the</b> Western Armenian dialect, instead of the Eastern Armenian spoken in Soviet Armenia. They were often addressed as aghbars ("brothers") by Armenians living in the republic, due to their different pronunciation of the word. Although initially used in humor, the word went on {{to carry on a}} more pejorative connotation. Their treatment by the Soviet government was not much better. A number of Armenian immigrants in 1946 had their belongings confiscated upon arrival at Odessa's port, as they had taken with them everything they had, including clothes and jewelry. This was the first disappointment experienced by Armenians; however, as there was no possibility of return the Armenians were forced to continue their journey to Armenia. Many of the immigrants were targeted by Soviet intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Interior for real or perceived ties to Armenian nationalist organizations, and were later sent to labor camps in Siberia and elsewhere, where they would not be released until after Stalin's death.|$|E

The Kingdom of Alba was overwhelmingly an oral society dominated by Gaelic culture.

40|$|The role of {{bombardment}} {{of the rings}} by the dominant size of meteoroids is examined.

30|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the source of}} this dynamics in the star, assume a situation where all players start contributing the same amount (say k) at period 1. Initially, the dynamics leads to lower contributions of <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> than <b>the</b> center at period 2 (due to the limited observability of <b>the</b> <b>spokes).</b> <b>The</b> average drop of the contributions is sharp due to the higher number of <b>spokes.</b> <b>The</b> next period, the drop of the contributions of <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> (reacting to a relatively higher contribution of the center) is softer than the drop of the contribution the center (reacting to relatively lower contributions of <b>the</b> <b>spokes</b> at period 2). This makes that the drop of the average contribution is now softer (again due to the higher number of spokes). This “oscillating dynamics” then repeats over time (from odd to even periods). This argument is formalized in the following lemma, which provides the analytic solution of the system of difference equations (3) for this specific case. The proof is in Appendix A 2.|$|R
5|$|When {{the crowd}} finally reached Versailles, it {{was met by}} another group that had {{assembled}} from the surrounding area. Members of the Assembly greeted the marchers and invited Maillard into their hall, where he fulminated about the Flanders Regiment and the people's need for bread. As he <b>spoke,</b> <b>the</b> restless Parisians came pouring into the Assembly and sank exhausted on the deputies' benches. Hungry, fatigued, and bedraggled from the rain, they seemed {{to confirm that the}} siege was a simple demand for food. The unprotected deputies {{had no choice but to}} receive the marchers, who shouted down most of the speakers and demanded to hear from the popular reformist deputy Mirabeau. The great orator declined this chance at demagoguery but nonetheless mingled familiarly with the market women, even sitting for some time with one of them upon his knee. A few other deputies welcomed the marchers warmly, including Maximilien Robespierre who was still at that time a relatively obscure figure in politics. Robespierre gave strong words of support to the women and their plight, and his efforts were received appreciatively; his solicitations helped greatly to soften the crowd's hostility towards the Assembly.|$|E
