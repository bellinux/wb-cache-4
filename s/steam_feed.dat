25|$|An {{oscillating}} {{engine was}} {{a type of}} direct-acting engine {{that was designed to}} achieve further reductions in engine size and weight. Oscillating engines had the piston rods connected directly to the crankshaft, dispensing with the need for connecting rods. In order to achieve this aim, the engine cylinders were not immobile as in most engines, but secured in the middle by trunnions which allowed the cylinders themselves to pivot back and forth as the crankshaft rotated, hence the term oscillating. Steam was supplied and exhausted through the trunnions. The oscillating motion of the cylinder was usually used to line up ports in the trunnions to direct the <b>steam</b> <b>feed</b> and exhaust to the cylinder at the correct times. However, separate valves may be provided, controlled by the oscillating motion. This allows the timing to be varied to enable expansive working. (As, for example, the engine in the paddle ship PD Krippen.) This compromises the advantage of simplicity but still retains the advantage of compactness.|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday, March 3, 1895, Bailey Gatzert {{was to make}} a trial trip at Portland, Oregon, {{with the}} crew on board only. [...] However, this did not take place due to a cracked <b>steam</b> <b>feed</b> pipe, which had to be replaced. [...] On March 4, 1895, A.

[...] Bailey Gatzert departed Portland at 7:00a.m., carrying the officers of the steamer’s owners, the Columbia River and Puget Sound Navigation Company, and a large number of other passengers.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{population}} grew, a commercial district {{developed in the}} downtown area, made accessible by a mule-drawn trolley system that connected {{different parts of the}} city. The company that oversaw that system was the Meridian Street Railway Company, organized in 1883. At its peak the mule-drawn line included about four miles of track throughout the city. Industry profits helped finance the construction of most of the city's major buildings, including the Grand Opera House and its associated Marks-Rothenberg Store, which opened in 1890. [...] The opera house, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was combined with the neighboring Marks-Rothenberg Department Store and renovated in 2006 into an upscale theater and conference center. Together the buildings now comprise [...] "The Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and Performing Arts." [...] A significant business that developed in this period was Soulé <b>Steam</b> <b>Feed</b> Works, incorporated by George W. Soulé in 1893, which industrialized cotton and helped grow the lumber industry in the city. Partly due to Soulé's business, Mississippi was ranked sixth among the states in cotton seed production by the 1920s.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of gas flow rate on the gas production rate from n-dodecane using steam reforming in-liquid plasma. A steam reforming of n-dodecane was carried out within the reactor vessel which was connected to awaveguide, an aluminum rectangular tubes that guides the propagation of electromagnetic waves with minimum loss of energy. The liquid medium used for plasma generation was n-dodecane (commercial reagent). The tip of a single electrode was positioned in the bottom center of the reactor vessel for plasma formation. The produced gas flowed through an aspirator and was trapped and collected in a water filled container. The gas production rate was measured and its compositions were analyzed using a gas chromatograph. The gas production rate by plasma with <b>steam</b> <b>feeding</b> was 1. 4 times greater than that by plasma without <b>steam</b> <b>feeding.</b> The hydrogen content of the gas produced ranged from 73 % to 82 %. The maximum energy efficiency, as indicated by the ratio of the enthalpy difference of the chemical reactions to the input energy, was approximately 12 %. The maximum hydrogen generation efficiency obtained from experiments was up to 59 % higher than the efficiency of hydrogen production from electrolysis of alkaline solutions as reported in literatures. The energy payback ratio of hydrogen (EPRH 2 ???was also calculated in order to obtain the hydrogen production efficiency...|$|R

5000|$|In 1859, after {{establishing}} a pump-manufacturing plant in New York, he perfected his duplex <b>steam</b> <b>feed</b> pump (patent No. 24,838) {{and in the}} following year built the first water-works engine of this kind. In the duplex system one engine actuated the steam valves of the other, and a pause of the pistons {{at the end of the}} stroke permitted the water-valves to seat themselves quietly and preserve a uniform water pressure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>feed</b> {{is taken}} {{from the bottom of}} the boiler and {{directly}} to the valve chest housing the semi-rotative valve. This consists of a brass rod, cross drilled with two holes at right angles to each other, a small distance apart. The outside end of the rod has a crank, linked to a crank on the engine crankshaft, so that it rocks back and forth by about 90 degrees. This causes the two holes to alternately line up with the steam and exhaust passages.|$|E

50|$|Most Mamod models use {{simple but}} {{effective}} oscillating cylinders, usually single-acting. Some of these engines have regulators {{either in the}} <b>steam</b> <b>feed</b> or exhaust but many others run unregulated (in the simpler models) or have a simple reversing mechanism to alter the cutoff, thus controlling the power/speed {{and direction of the}} engine. Early models had single or multi-wick lamps or vapourising spirit burners but in the mid-1970s the company changed to hexamine solid fuel which came in tablet form and provided low heat in a relatively safe form.|$|E
50|$|Soulé founded {{two other}} {{companies}} before <b>Steam</b> <b>Feed</b> Works, the Southern Standard Cotton Press Company and the Progress Manufacturing Company. Short of money after his railroad accident, {{he decided to}} build his own cotton press for his fledgling cotton gin. The invention was simpler and less expensive than those {{on the market and}} attracted wide attention. Soulé called his invention the Southern Standard Cotton Press and founded the company around this machine. In 1881, two years after he moved the business to Meridian, the company sold 750 cotton presses all over the South.|$|E

5000|$|All four {{ships were}} plagued by their machinery, as the steam {{turbines}} had numerous design flaws. The problems were remedied {{by removing the}} <b>steam</b> <b>feed</b> to {{the lower half of}} the reversing turbine, but this halved reversing power, and as a consequence these ships were slow to decelerate and handled rather sluggishly. This problem proved fatal for Battleaxe, when she was unable to manoeuvre quickly enough to prevent herself being rammed by the frigate [...] in the Clyde in 1962. The damage was so catastrophic that it was beyond economical repair and she was written off as a total loss and scrapped.|$|E
50|$|In 1886, Soulé {{sold the}} Southern Standard Press after {{founding}} Progress Manufacturing in 1894, and invented the Ideal Hay-Press {{for use in}} the new company. This new business was located on 5th Street between 26th and 27th Avenues and grew to include a foundry and machine shop. Looking to invent more, he turned over active management to Progress Manufacturing in 1888 and began working on a small rotary engine. He sold Progress Manufacturing in 1891 and established <b>Steam</b> <b>Feed</b> Works. The business was incorporated in 1893. In total, Soulé patented over 40 items during his lifetime, including the Success Cotton Seed Huller and an improved version of the sugar mill.|$|E
50|$|In 1902, {{when the}} new <b>Steam</b> <b>Feed</b> Works had become well-established, Soulé found a country home in Santa Rosa County, Florida. He began to turn much of the company over to his son, Clyde, and spent more {{of his time in}} Florida, before {{returning}} to Meridian in 1917, where he stayed until his death on December 21, 1922. During his life he had two wives - Olivia Sherman Warren in 1873 and Constance Gara in 1907, two years after his former wife's death - and nine children. One of his grand children, also named George Soulé, was an influential R&B songwriter in the 1960s and 70s.|$|E

50|$|An {{oscillating}} cylinder engine {{cannot be}} reversed {{by means of}} the valve linkage (as in a normal fixed cylinder) because there is none. Reversing of the engine can be achieved by reversing the steam connections between inlet and exhaust or, in the case of small engines, by shifting the trunnion pivot point so that the port in the cylinder lines up with a different pair of ports in the port face. In the latter case, the fixed port face is usually provided with three ports, the central one being the <b>steam</b> <b>feed</b> and the outer two being exhausts, only one of which being in use at any time, depending on the required direction of running.|$|E
50|$|Soulé <b>Steam</b> <b>Feed</b> Works was {{originally}} {{located at the}} corner of 25th Avenue and 5th Street. The first building built on the company's present lot was built between 1890 and 1892 was formerly the Meridian Candy Factory. After the building was devastated by fire, George Soulé bought it {{and turned it into a}} machine shop, assembly area, and office for the up-and-coming business, which would later relocate there. The two-story building's facade {{was originally}} brick, but a layer of lime cement stucco was added in the 1930s, and a second layer was added in the late 1960s. Inside the building is an 8 ft x 12 ft fireproof vault, which holds the original company records. Above the vault, the company is written in gold. The vault was added after an 1895 fire destroyed George Soulé's office and the records in it.|$|E
