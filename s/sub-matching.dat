40|$|We study vortex {{states and}} {{dynamics}} in 2 D superconductors with periodic pinning at fractional <b>sub-matching</b> fields using numerical simulations. For square pinning arrays {{we show that}} ordered states form at 1 / 1, 1 / 2, and 1 / 4 filling fractions while only partially ordered states form at other filling fractions, such as 1 / 3 and 1 / 5, in agreement with recent imaging experiments. For triangular pinning arrays we observe matching effects at filling fractions of 1 / 1, 6 / 7, 2 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 4, 1 / 6, and 1 / 7. For both square and triangular pinning arrays we also find that, for certian <b>sub-matching</b> fillings, vortex configurations depend on pinning strength. For weak pinning, ordering in which {{a portion of the}} vortices are positioned between pinning sites can occur. Depinning of the vortices at the matching fields, where the vortices are ordered, is elastic while at the incommensurate fields the motion is plastic. At the incommensurate fields, as the applied driving force is increased, there can be a transition to elastic flow where the vortices move along the pinning sites in 1 D channels and a reordering transition to a triangular or distorted triangular lattice. We also discuss the current-voltage curves and how they relate to the vortex ordering at commensurate and incommensurate fields. Comment: 14 figure...|$|E
40|$|Motion is {{the major}} feature that differentiates a video from a still image. In {{content-based}} retrieval, the motion track of a symbol object {{can be used as}} an index of video databases. Query processing based on such index can be treated as a curve matching problem. Two important criteria for solving the problem are <b>sub-matching</b> and approximate-matching. In this paper, two query processing approaches are proposed. The first approach expands the motion track index to a region and allows a user to query against this region. In the second approach, both the motion track index and the query curve are modeled as a combination of peaks and each peak is coded according to its orientation, angle and temporal information. The curve matching problem is then converted into a string matching problem, which is solved efficiently by a new finite automata based method. The proposed string matching algorithm is also shown to be scalable to the growth {{of the size of the}} database. 1...|$|E
40|$|Using {{magneto-optical}} imaging technique, we map local {{magnetic field}} distribution inside a hexagonally ordered array of blind holes patterned in BSCCO single crystals. The {{nature of the}} spatial distribution of local magnetic field and shielding currents across the array reveals {{the presence of a}} non-uniform vortex configuration partially matched with the blind holes at <b>sub-matching</b> fields. We observe that the filling fraction is different in two different regions of the array. The mean vortex configuration within the array is described as a patchy vortex configuration with the patches having different mean filling fraction. The patchy nature of the vortex configuration is more pronounced at partial filling of the array at low fields while the configuration becomes more uniform with a unique filling fraction at higher fields. The metastable nature of this patchy vortex configuration is revealed by the application of magnetic field pulses of fixed height or individual pulses of varying height to the array. The metastability of the vortex configuration allows for a relatively easy way of producing flux reorganization and flux focusing effects within the blind hole array. Effect of the magnetic field pulses modifies the vortex configuration within the array and produces a uniform enhancement in the shielding current around the patterned array edges. The enhanced shielding current concentrates magnetic flux within the array by driving vortices away from the edges and towards the center of the array. The enhanced shielding current also prevents the uninhibited entry of vortices into the array. We propose that the metastable patchy vortex configuration within the blind hole array is due to a non-uniform pinning landscape leading to non-uniform filling of individual blind holes.
