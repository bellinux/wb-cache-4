Also included are expanded tables and cases; improved notations and figures within the tables; consistent table and equation numbering and verification of correction factors. The book organizes the formulas into tables in a hierarchical format - chapter, table, case, subcase—providing diagrams for each case and <b>subcase.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>subcase</b> {{obtained}} by restricting to a finite constraint language {{is called a}} non-uniform problem. These problems are mostly considered when expressing constraint satisfaction {{in terms of the}} homomorphism problem, as explained below. Uniform problems were also defined in the settings of homomorphism problems; a uniform problem can be defined as the union of a (possibly infinite) collection of non-uniform problems. A uniform problem made of an infinite set of non-uniform problems can be intractable even if all these non-uniform problems are tractable.|$|E
50|$|Classifying {{solutions}} of the EFE {{constitutes a}} large part of general relativity research. Various approaches to classifying spacetimes, including using the Segre classification of the energy-momentum tensor or the Petrov classification of the Weyl tensor have been studied extensively by many researchers, most notably Stephani et al. (2003). They also classify spacetimes using symmetry vector fields (especially Killing and homothetic symmetries). For example, Killing vector fields may be used to classify spacetimes, as {{there is a limit to}} the number of global, smooth Killing vector fields that a spacetime may possess (the maximum being 10 for 4-dimensional spacetimes). Generally speaking, the higher the dimension of the algebra of symmetry vector fields on a spacetime, the more symmetry the spacetime admits. For example, the Schwarzschild solution has a Killing algebra of dimension 4 (3 spatial rotational vector fields and a time translation), whereas the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric (excluding the Einstein static <b>subcase)</b> has a Killing algebra of dimension 6 (3 translations and 3 rotations). The Einstein static metric has a Killing algebra of dimension 7 (the previous 6 plus a time translation).|$|E
5000|$|Prolongation. This is {{the most}} {{intricate}} case. In fact there are two sub-cases. In the first sub-case, all of the torsion can be uniquely absorbed into the connection form. (Riemannian manifolds are an example, since the Levi-Civita connection absorbs all of the torsion). The connection coefficients and their invariant derivatives form {{a complete set of}} invariants of the structure, and the equivalence problem is solved. In the second <b>subcase,</b> however, it is either impossible to absorb all of the torsion, or there is some ambiguity (as is often the case in Gaussian elimination, for example). Here, just as in Gaussian elimination, there are additional parameters which appear in attempting to absorb the torsion. These parameters themselves turn out to be additional invariants of the problem, so the structure group G must be prolonged into a subgroup of a jet group. Once this is done, one obtains a new coframe on the prolonged space and has to return to the first step of the equivalence method. (See also prolongation of G-structures.) ...|$|E

We propose to develop formal verification techniques for access control policies {{to improve the}} current state of the art of policy specification and management. In this paper, we formalize classes of security analysis problems in the context of Role-Based Access Control. We show that in general these problems are PSPACE-complete. We also study the factors that contribute to the computational complexity by considering a lattice of various <b>subcases</b> of the problem with differ-ent restrictions. We show that several <b>subcases</b> remain PSPACE-complete, several further restricted <b>subcases</b> are NP-complete, and identify two <b>subcases</b> that are solvable in polynomial time. We also discuss our experi-ences and findings from experimentations that use existing formal method tools, such as model checking and logic programming, for addressing these problems.
