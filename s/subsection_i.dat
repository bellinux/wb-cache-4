40|$|Background: Signaling {{networks}} in eukaryotes {{are made up}} of upstream and downstream subnetworks. The upstream subnetwork contains the intertwined network of signaling pathways, while the downstream regulatory part contains transcription factors and their binding sites on the DNA as well as microRNAs and their mRNA targets. Currently, most signaling and regulatory databases contain only a subsection of this network, making comprehensive analyses highly time-consuming and dependent on specific data handling expertise. The need for detailed mapping of signaling systems is also supported by the fact that several drug development failures were caused by undiscovered cross-talk or regulatory effects of drug targets. We previously created a uniformly curated signaling pathway resource, SignaLink, to facilitate the analysis of pathway cross-talks. Here, we present SignaLink 2, which significantly extends the coverage and applications of its predecessor. Description: We developed a novel concept to integrate and utilize different <b>subsections</b> (<b>i.</b> e., layers) of the signaling network. The multi-layered (onion-like) database structure is made up of signaling pathways, their pathway regulators (e. g., scaffold and endocytotic proteins) and modifier enzymes (e. g., phosphatases, ubiquitin ligases), as well as transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators of all of these components.

These teams would, of course, be working on different aspects of the general problem described. This is especially true of <b>subsections</b> <b>I,</b> III and IV. I. Average Frobenius Distributions. A topic of central importance in number theory over the past decade has been the theory of elliptic curves. We can think of an elliptic curve as the set of fractional solutions to an equation of the form (1) E: y 2 = x 3 + Ax + B. One of the major conjectures in this area is the Lang-Trotter conjecture (see [10]). This conjecture deals with the local behavior of a given curve, that is the number of solutions to an equation like the one above modulo a prime p. It is known that the number of solutions to such an equation modulo p counting a point at infinity is between p+ 1 − 2 √ p and p+ 1 + 2 √ p, and that all integers in this range are obtained by some curve modulo p.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the topic of "hate speech" {{in relation to the}} freedom of expression. In the first part, I went into the legislation on freedom of expression and hate speech in our legal system. I devoted a considerable part to international treaties concerning this issue that, according to the Constitution, are a part of our laws and base of the national legislation to a great extent. There are two different approaches to the freedom of expression - the American and European one. The first one is close to the absolute concept of freedom of speech that also covers the hate speech. The second one excludes the hate speech from its protection. The most typical representatives of these two approaches are the U. S. and Germany so I have also paid attention to the legislation of the two countries. As this topic is extremely wide, I chose for the practical part a few cases that are somehow boundary.

The user-friendly website allows the interactive exploration of how each signaling protein is regulated. The customizable download page enables the analysis of any user-specified part of the signaling network. Compared to other signaling resources, distinctive features of SignaLink 2 are the following: 1) it involves experimental data not only from humans but from two invertebrate model organisms, C. elegans and D. melanogaster; 2) combines manual curation with large-scale datasets; 3) provides confidence scores for each interaction; 4) operates a customizable download page with multiple file formats (e. g., BioPAX, Cytoscape, SBML). Non-profit users can access SignaLink 2 free of charge at [URL] CONCLUSIONS With SignaLink 2 as a single resource, users can effectively analyze signaling pathways, scaffold proteins, modifier enzymes, transcription factors and miRNAs that are important in the regulation of signaling processes.

These problems caused by — or rather attributed to — the plurality of society are usually countered by educational programs like multi-, intercultural or even anti-racist education. Most of the discussions around these developments appear to be centred on the content of these ‘all- pervading ’ changes in education. However, one rarely reads something about pedagogical consequences. Should plurality in the classroom influence the processes of teaching, and the pedagogy that governs these processes?
