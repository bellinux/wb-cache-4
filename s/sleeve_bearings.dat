50|$|From November 1944 through February 1945, a {{conversion}} process {{began to use}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> in the Panther tank, as there was a shortage of ball bearings. The <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> were primarily used in the running gear; plans were also made to convert the transmission to <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings,</b> but were not carried out due to the ending of Panther production.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> use two {{surfaces}} lubricated {{with oil}} or grease as a friction contact. They often use porous sintered sleeves to be self-lubricating, requiring only infrequent maintenance or replacement. <b>Sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are less durable at higher temperatures as the contact surfaces wear and the lubricant dries up, eventually leading to failure; however, lifetime {{is similar to}} that of ball-bearing types (generally a little less) at relatively low ambient temperatures. <b>Sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> may be more likely to fail at higher temperatures, and may perform poorly when mounted in any orientation other than vertical. The typical lifespan of a sleeve-bearing fan may be around 30,000 hours at 50 °C. Fans that use <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are generally cheaper than fans that use ball bearings, and are quieter at lower speeds early in their life, but can become noisy as they age.|$|E

50|$|Plain bearing, {{consisting}} of a shaft rotating in a hole. There are several specific styles: bushing, journal <b>bearing,</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing,</b> rifle bearing, composite bearing.|$|R
50|$|The {{accident}} {{was attributed to}} the disengagement of {{the left and right}} spur gear teeth in the main transmission, caused by the load imposed by the failure of the gearbox's rear <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> journals. The rear <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> failure was caused by an oil leak although evidence was destroyed by fire and the source of the leak was not established.|$|R

5000|$|Operating {{temperature}} (For example, <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> {{are suitable}} to 250 °F/121.1 °C; ball bearings to 550 °F/287.8 °C) ...|$|E
5000|$|Rifle {{bearings}} {{are similar}} to <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings,</b> but are quieter and have almost as much lifespan as ball bearings. The bearing has a spiral groove in it that pumps fluid from a reservoir. This allows them to be safely mounted with the shaft horizontal (unlike <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings),</b> since the fluid being pumped lubricates {{the top of the}} shaft. The pumping also ensures sufficient lubricant on the shaft, reducing noise, and increasing lifespan.|$|E
50|$|Bearings {{may also}} be packed with other materials. Historically, the wheels on {{railroad}} cars used <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> packed with waste or loose scraps of cotton or wool fiber soaked in oil, then later used solid pads of cotton.|$|E
25|$|The BCNR33 GT-R version {{also had}} the same RB26DETT engine that the BNR32 was {{equipped}} with, although torque had been improved, due {{to changes in the}} turbo compressor aerodynamics, turbo dump pipe, and intercooler. The turbo core changed from a <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> to a ball bearing, but the turbine itself remained ceramic, except on N1 turbos (steel turbine, <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing).</b> From the R33 onward, all GT-Rs received Brembo brakes. In 1995 the GT-R received an improved version of the RB26DETT, the ATTESA-ETS four-wheel-drive system, and Super HICAS 4-wheel steering.|$|R

50|$|<b>Sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> of inch {{dimensions}} are almost exclusively dimensioned using the SAE numbering system. The numbering system uses the format -XXYY-ZZ, where XX is the ID in sixteenths of an inch, YY is the OD in sixteenths of an inch, and ZZ is the length in eighths of an inch. Metric sizes also exist.|$|E
50|$|Bearings are an {{important}} part of a fan. Sleeve-ring oil bearings are used extensively in fans. Some sleeve-ring bearings may be water-cooled. Water-cooled <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are often used when the fan moves hot gases. Heat is conducted through the shaft and into the oil, which must be cooled to prevent overheating the bearing. Lower-speed fans have bearings in hard-to-reach spots, so they use grease-packed bearings.|$|E
50|$|Casters used in {{and around}} {{furnaces}} and ovens must withstand extreme heat. General purpose casters cannot survive excessive heat because tread materials, lubricants and other critical components can fail. For example, at 200 degrees F, common resilient tread materials are at or above their functional temperature limits. High temperature casters employ special lubricants and materials that can withstand higher heat. Additionally, for very high temperatures, special <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> may be used that have no lubricant whatsoever.|$|E

5000|$|Ball bearings: Though {{generally}} more expensive, ball bearing fans do not {{suffer the same}} orientation limitations as <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> fans, are more durable at higher temperatures, and are quieter than sleeve-bearing fans at higher rotation speeds. The typical lifespan of a ball bearing fan may be over 60,000 hours at 50 °C.|$|R

5000|$|The turbine spins on simple <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> for {{vibration-free}} running. Its simplicity {{offers the}} potential for long life, and because no combustion contaminants enter engine oil, no oil changes are considered necessary. The 1963 Turbine's engine generated [...] and an instant [...] of torque at stall speed, making it good for 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in 12 seconds at an ambient temperature of 85 F—it can sprint quicker if the ambient air was cooler and denser.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970s, the People Powered Vehicle was produced. It was a two-seat, [...] "sociable" [...] {{tandem with}} a steel sub frame and molded plastic body. It was well {{designed}} and weighed something over 50 kg; a recently restored version weighs 59 kg. However, it had {{flaws in the}} execution that doomed it as a practical, everyday vehicle. Positive features, such as easily adjustable and comfortable seats, independent pedalling for both passenger and driver, adequate cargo space and relatively good weather protection, could not overcome the negative features, such as a complex, heavy and badly spaced three-speed gear box, ineffective brakes, and pedals that slid on <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> on steel shafts, which {{made it difficult to}} use as an everyday vehicle.|$|E

50|$|Normally, a {{white or}} blue Oxford shirt is worn, {{as well as}} black slacks, black leather shoes and a black bow tie. Latex gloves are {{sometimes}} worn for sanitary reasons. For professional matches a patch is usually worn on the left breast bearing the insignia of the organization sanctioning the fight. The referee may also wear a patch on his left <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearing</b> the flag of his home country. This is especially common in matches between fighters from two different countries.|$|R
5000|$|Self-lubricating composites: Solid {{lubricants}} such as PTFE, graphite, MoS2 {{and some}} other anti-friction and anti-wear additives are often compounded in polymers and all kind of sintered materials. MoS2, for example, is compounded in materials for <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings,</b> elastomer O-rings, carbon brushes, etc. Solid lubricants are compounded in plastics to form a [...] "self-lubricating" [...] or [...] "internally lubricated" [...] thermoplastic composite. For example, PTFE particles compounded in the plastic form a PTFE film over the mating surface, resulting in a reduction of friction and wear. MoS2 compounded in nylon reduces wear, friction and stick-slip. Furthermore, it acts as a nucleating agent effecting in a very fine crystalline structure. The primary use of graphite lubricated thermoplastics is in applications operating in aqueous environments.|$|E
5000|$|... "Rumble" [...] {{is a form}} {{of noise}} {{characteristic}} caused by imperfections in the bearings of turntables, the platter tends to have a slight amount of motion besides the desired rotation—the turntable surface also moves up-and-down and side-to-side slightly. This additional motion is added to the desired signal as noise, usually of very low frequencies, creating a [...] "rumbling" [...] sound during quiet passages. Very inexpensive turntables sometimes used ball bearings which are very likely to generate audible amounts of rumble. More expensive turntables tend to use massive <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> which are much less likely to generate offensive amounts of rumble. Increased turntable mass also tends to lead to reduced rumble. A good turntable should have rumble at least 60 dB below the specified output level from the pick-up.|$|E
5000|$|The Zip drive {{had a very}} {{low-cost}} {{and revolutionary}} linear actuator to move the read/write {{head back and forth}} on the Zip disk media. This actuator slid back and forth on a single thin steel rod using two <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings.</b> Under normal drive use, the actuator was under the servo control of the drive. If the drive had its power removed inadvertently by being unplugged or power outage, the read/write heads were pulled off the disk by a power-loss circuit. This was to prevent damage by the heads being left on the media. When the actuator was removed in this manner, it slammed to a stop at the end of its travel. This violent stopping of the actuator could damage the fragile suspension system of the read/write head. To protect from this damage, the drive designers placed a small doughnut-shaped foam washer at the end of the thin steel bearing the actuator slid on. A cost reduction effort within Iomega manufacturing decided that to reduce cost, they would remove this part. Zip drives that followed for a several month period exhibited the click of death. This omission was discovered by the drive's original designers and the washer was put back into the design, and new Zip drives did not experience this click of death.|$|E

40|$|Plastic sliding {{bearings}} in massive and composite structure mostly {{are used as}} wearing bearing. The author tries to improve the availability of thermoplastic massive {{sliding bearings}} with radial realization under different operation conditions. Experiments with initial lubrication and start-stop operation are described. The wear behavior of thermoplastic massive sliding bearings is determined with run-up and run-out experiments. The experiments concerning to the sliding bearings are realized on special test stands. This considers the fact that proceedings in thermoplastic sliding bearings {{are a part of}} complex tribologic systems. Short-time experiments provide sufficiently exact statements according to specific wear rates. If the thermoplastic sliding bearing works at its maximum load, the chemical degradation of the plastics and a reduction of the durability of the storage material may be observed. An initial lubrication with fat decreases the medium-coefficient of friction, the specific shear rate and storage temperatures. Non lubricated HT thermoplastic <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> can be used successfully at start-stop operations. In comparison to endurance tests with non lubricated HT thermoplastic <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings,</b> little medium coefficients of friction and little specific wear rates are established in start-stop operation. Endurance tests with non lubricated sheathed bearings provide little medium coefficients of friction in comparison to non lubricated <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings.</b> The specific wear rate is higher {{as in the case of}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings.</b> The basic estimations with respect to the endurance tests with non lubricated <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> are transferable to the start-stop experiments. 114 figs., 37 tabs., 152 refs.

40|$|This paper shows a {{theoretical}} vibration analysis regarding excitation due to elliptical shaft journals in <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> of electrical motors, {{based on a}} simplified rotordynamic model. It is shown that elliptical shaft journals lead to kinematic constraints regarding {{the movement of the}} shaft journals on the oil film of the <b>sleeve</b> <b>bearings</b> and therefore to an excitation of the rotordynamic system. The solution of the linear differential equation system leads to the mathematical description of the movement of the rotor mass, the shaft journals, and the sleeve bearing housings. Additionally the relative movements between the shaft journals and the bearing housings are deduced, as well as the bearing housing vibration velocities. The presented simplified rotordynamic model can also be applied to rotating machines, other than electrical machines. In this case, only the electromagnetic spring value cm has to be put to zero...|$|E
