From the perspective of the PED DESY is legally designated as the manufacturer and is responsible for conformity to all relevant codes. During module assemblies at CEA Saclay the orbital welds of the interconnection bellows between cavities showed pores with dimensions outside the specifications set by DESY. These welds needed to be redone which caused a project delay of several months. The X-ray examination of the HSP showed that the pipes already exhibited many out-of- DESY spec pores in the longitudinal welds and were most likely the main cause of the problems in the orbital welds. It was decided to replace the extremities of the <b>service</b> <b>pipes</b> with seamless titanium tubes both on “naked” helium tanks as well as on tanks with cavities already welded in. At DESY more than 750 <b>service</b> <b>pipes</b> were exchanged over a period of 2 years.

The second night in Orlando saw the tour debut of [...] "I Saw Her Standing There" [...] in place of [...] "Get Back". These two songs would usually alternate between shows. At Bonnaroo, which was the largest attendance crowd on the tour, McCartney performed [...] "Midnight Special" [...] because of lyrics referring to nearby Nashville. The show in Ottawa brought the tour debuts of the songs [...] "Michelle" [...] and [...] "Mull of Kintyre" [...] to the setlist. [...] "Mull of Kintyre" [...] was performed with the full Ottawa Police <b>Service</b> <b>Pipe</b> Band. In Seattle, McCartney brought onstage the remaining members of Nirvana - Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic, plus their touring musician Pat Smear - to perform their collaborative effort [...] "Cut Me Some Slack" [...] from Grohl's movie Sound City. The three continued onstage with McCartney and the band to finish the encore, which included the first performance of [...] "Long Tall Sally" [...] since 1986. [...] "Birthday" [...] was performed for the first time on the tour at the Plains of Abraham show, which also featured [...] "Michelle". At Outside Lands, McCartney replaced [...] "All My Loving" [...] with [...] "Magical Mystery Tour" [...] early in the show. He also performed [...] "San Francisco Bay Blues" [...] and dedicated that song to both [...] "Shelly" [...] and the city of San Francisco. During the encore, McCartney brought the Kronos Quartet, who had already performed with The National earlier in the day, onstage with him and Wickens to perform [...] "Yesterday".

40|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracks (SCC) {{had been}} found in a natural gas transmission pipeline during a dig-up and inspection program. The question was raised as to whether the SCC was active or dormant. This paper describes the resultant investigation to determine if a particular service crack was actively growing. The strategy adopted was to assess the appearance of the fracture surface of the service crack and to compare with expectations from laboratory specimens with active SCC. The conclusions from this study are as follows. To judge whether a crack in the <b>service</b> <b>pipe</b> is active or dormant, it is reasonable to compare the very crack tip of the service crack and a fresh crack in a laboratory sample. If the crack tip of the active laboratory sample {{is similar to that of}} the <b>service</b> <b>pipe,</b> it means the crack in the <b>service</b> <b>pipe</b> is likely to be active. From the comparison of the crack tip between the <b>service</b> <b>pipe</b> and the laboratory samples, it appears likely that the cracks in the samples extracted from service were most likely to have been active intergranular stress corrosion cracks.

40|$|JEL No. I 1,N 30 Beginning around 1880, {{public health}} issues and {{engineering}} advances spurred {{the installation of}} city water and sewer systems. As part of this growth, many cities chose to use lead <b>service</b> <b>pipes</b> to connect residences to city water systems. This choice had negative consequences for child mortality, although the consequences were often hard to observe amid the overall falling death rates. This paper uses national data from the public use sample of the 1900 Census of Population and data on city use of lead pipes in 1897 to estimate the effect of lead pipes on child mortality. In 1900, 29 percent of the married women in the United States who {{had given birth to}} at least one child and were age forty-five or younger lived in locations where lead <b>service</b> <b>pipes</b> were used to deliver water. Because the effect of lead pipes depended on the acidity and hardness of the water, much of the negative effect was concentrated on the densely populated eastern seaboard. In the full sample, women who lived on the eastern seaboard in cities with lead pipes experienced increased child mortality of 9. 3 percent relative to the sample average. These estimates suggest that the number of child deaths attributable to the use of lead pipes numbered in the tens of thousands. Many surviving children may have experienced substantial I...|$|R
