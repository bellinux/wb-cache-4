50|$|Casing, sausage casing, or <b>sausage</b> <b>skin</b> is the {{material}} that encloses the filling of a sausage. Casings are divided into two categories, natural and artificial. Artificial casings, such as collagen, cellulose, plastic, and extruded casings, are relatively new to the field, mainly borne of market demand during the technological advances of the early 20th century.|$|R

5000|$|ConPro systems: ConPro systems (continuous {{production}} systems) {{are special}} continuous co-extrusion systems for producing sausages with alginate skin. With this application, two vacuum fillers are operated in synchronisation and their filling flows {{are combined into}} one continuous product flow. Further down the process, the continuous string is divided into individual portions or strings of portions. One vacuum filler pumps the filling product while a second one deposits the skin (a paste containing alginate) via an annular gap. This is solidified {{by means of a}} fixing solution containing calcium ions. Depending on the degree of automation, the portions can be hung or collated or transported further for continuous thermal treatment or packaging. The most important advantage of the ConPro systems in comparison to traditional production methods is that <b>sausage</b> <b>skins</b> or casings no longer have to be changed. Due to continuous co-extrusion there are no casing change times and therefore the filling time is maximised.|$|E

50|$|Drisheen (drisín) {{is a type}} {{of blood}} pudding made in Ireland. It is {{distinguished}} from other forms of Irish black pudding by having a gelatinous consistency. It is made from a mixture of cow's, pig's and/or sheep's blood, milk, salt and fat which is boiled and sieved and finally cooked using the main intestine of an animal (typically a pig or sheep) as the <b>sausage</b> <b>skin.</b> The <b>sausage</b> may be flavoured with herbs, such as tansy. The recipe for drisheen varies widely from place to place and it also differs depending on the time of year. Drisheen is a cooked product but it usually requires further preparation before eating.

5000|$|In the UK and Ireland, {{sausages}} are a {{very popular}} and common feature of the national diet and popular culture. British sausages and Irish sausages are normally made from raw (i.e., uncooked, uncured, unsmoked) pork, beef, venison or other meats mixed {{with a variety of}} herbs and spices and cereals, many recipes of which are traditionally associated with particular regions (for example Cumberland sausages). They normally contain a certain amount of rusk or bread-rusk, and are traditionally cooked by frying, grilling or baking. They are most typically 10 - 15 cm long, the filling compressed by twisting the casing into concatenated [...] "links" [...] into the <b>sausage</b> <b>skin,</b> traditionally made from the prepared intestine of the slaughtered animal; most commonly a pig.|$|R
40|$|WO 200145917 A UPAB: 20010927 NOVELTY - Oriented tubular {{films are}} {{manufactured}} {{by using a}} spinning solution comprising a homogeneous solution of a mixture of cellulose and protein(s) in an n-methylmorpholine-n-oxide (NMMO) -water system. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Manufacture of oriented tubular films includes extrusion of a spinning solution using a ring nozzle over an external air gap into a precipitation bath. The spinning solution includes a homogeneous solution of a mixture of cellulose and protein(s) in NMMO-water system. The homogeneous solution is produced by withdrawing {{the water of the}} solution until both the cellulose and protein are dissolved completely. USE - The invention is used to manufacture oriented tubular films used as biodegradable and compostable packaging materials (claimed). Particularly, the films are used as <b>sausage</b> <b>skins</b> for hard sausages, and as peelable skins (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The invention provides strong and flexible tubular films, which make expensive after treatment or surface treatment unnecessary...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{preparation}} of cellulose articles by precipitating cellulose in a bath filled with a solution containing cellulose dissolved in an amine oxide/water system uses a cellulose solution containing cellulose fibres. Cellulose articles comprising composite materials of cellulose fibres embedded in a cellulose fibre matrix are also claimed. Preferably cellulose fibre content is 5 - 90 (20 - 60) %. Water content and/or the solution temperature in the bath are chosen {{to ensure that the}} fibre surfaces become swollen and/or partially dissolved. The mixture of cellulose fibres and cellulose solution is obtained by ensuring that not all of the cellulose fibres dissolve during {{the preparation of}} the cellulose solution. Chemical pulp, regenerated cellulose or natural fibres (eg. flax, hemp, jute, raffia, sisal, ramie or manila), or alternatively bacteria cellulose, are used. A tubular film is prepared by extruding the mixture through a circular nozzle. The E-modulus of the articles is 12 00 - 15000 MPa. USE - The articles are used as food packaging materials, especially <b>sausage</b> <b>skins</b> (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The highly oriented cellulose fibres in the uniaxially or biaxially oriented cellulose matrix increase the strength of the articles and provide anisotropic mechanical properties...|$|E

5000|$|Artists' books (such as An Anthology of Chance Operations) and {{multiples}} (as well as happenings), were {{central to}} Fluxus' ethos disdaining galleries and institutions, {{replacing them with}} [...] "art in the community", and the definition of what was and wasn't a book became increasingly elastic throughout the decade as the two forms collided. Many of the Fluxus editions share characteristics with both; George Brecht's Water Yam (1963), for instance, involves a series of scores collected in a box, whilst similar scores are collected together in a bound book in Yoko Ono's Grapefruit (1964). Another famous example is Literature Sausage by Dieter Roth, one of many artists to be affiliated to fluxus at one or other point in its history; each one was made from a pulped book mixed with onions and spices and stuffed into <b>sausage</b> <b>skin.</b> Literally a book, but utterly unreadable.

40|$|The {{effects of}} fat, raw pork skin and added {{water on the}} color, yield, texture and {{palatability}} of fresh pork sausage were investigated. Fresh pork sausage was produced to contain 8 percent and 20 percent fat, 10 percent or 20 percent pork skin and zero percent or 10 percent added water. Three controls were produced at 8 percent, 20 percent and 35 percent fat with no added pork <b>skin</b> or water. <b>Sausage</b> with added pork skins had increased pH values. The 8 percent fat sausage and sausage without added water had the greatest cook yields, while the addition of pork skin did not affect cook yield. Pork skins and added water caused sausage to be lighter in color. Redness of the sausage was similar for 20 percent fat/ 20 percent pork <b>skin</b> <b>sausage</b> compared to the 35 percent fat control. Kramer shear values indicated added water made sausage softer. Added pork skin did not affect Kramer shear values. A sensory panel rated 10 percent pork <b>skin</b> <b>sausage</b> more tender than sausage with 20 percent pork <b>skin.</b> <b>Sausage</b> with 8 percent fat and 10 percent pork skin was rated higher for juiciness and overall acceptability when compared to 8 percent fat sausage with 20 percent pork skin and 20 percent fat sausage at both added pork skin levels. Pork skins were successfully incorporated into reduced fat-fresh pork sausage. Production of acceptable reduced-fat pork sausage with added pork skins would increase the demand for this pork sausage and add value to a by-product of the pork industry...|$|R

Another neighbor testified to the alarming number of youths whom he had seen entering Haarmann's Neue Straße apartment, but whom he seldom observed leaving the address. This neighbor had assumed Haarmann was selling youths to the Foreign Legion; another neighbor testified to having observed Haarmann throw a sack of bones into the Leine River. Two female acquaintances of Hans Grans also testified how, on one occasion in 1923, they had discovered what they {{believed to be a}} human mouth boiling in a soup kettle in Haarmann's apartment; these witnesses testified they had taken the item to Hanover police, who had simply replied the piece of flesh may be a pig's snout.
