The base Seger formula used was 0. 3 KNaO, 0. 3 CaO, 0. 4 ZnO or BaO; xAl 2 O 3 and ySiO 2 . Different Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 formula ratios for glossy and matt glazes were tested with raw materials from Cameroon and Tanzania. In the Cameroonian glazes, a local pegmatite (quartz, microcline, albite) with low coloured oxides replaced an albitic feldspar in the Tanzanian glazes. The other materials were kaolin, limestone, silica and barium carbonate or zinc oxide. The glazes were tested at <b>Seger</b> <b>Cone</b> 7 (1240 ℃) on stoneware slabs (made up of the same feldspathic glaze material: 18 %, silica sand or quartz 27 %, ball clay 40 % and kaolin 15 %) from both Tanzania and Cameroon materials. From results obtained, zinc oxide acted as a more vigorous flux than barium carbonate at cone 7, which is obvious in the glazes with pegmatite (with high quartz content). At a Seger formula of Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 1 : 10, transparent glazes were obtained. In these glazes the alumina content was lower and when increased to higher Seger ratios 1 : 4. 7 - 8. 7, the gloss was lowered to matt-luster due to fine crystal formation...|$|E

5000|$|The {{pyrometric}} cone is [...] "A pyramid with a triangular base {{and of a}} defined shape and size; the [...] "cone" [...] is shaped from a carefully proportioned and uniformly mixed batch of ceramic materials so that when it is heated under stated conditions, it will bend due to softening, {{the tip of the}} cone becoming level with the base at a definitive temperature. Pyrometric cones are made in series, the temperature interval between the successive cones usually being 20 degrees Celsius. The best known series are <b>Seger</b> <b>Cones</b> (Germany), Orton Cones (USA) and Staffordshire Cones (UK)." ...|$|R
50|$|Stoneware can be once-fired or twice-fired. Maximum firing {{temperatures}} {{can vary}} significantly, from 1100 °C to 1300 °C {{depending on the}} flux content. Typically, temperatures will be between 1180 °C to 1280 °C, the higher end of which equate to Bullers Rings 38 to 40 or <b>Seger</b> <b>cones</b> 4 to 8. To produce a better quality fired glaze finish, twice-firing can be used. This can be especially important for formulations composed of highly carbonaceous clays. For these, biscuit firing is around 900 °C, and glost firing (the firing used to form the glaze over the ware) 1180 - 1280 °C. Water absorption of stoneware products is less than 1 percent.|$|R
50|$|In 1915, a {{department}} was {{established for the}} commercial production of <b>Seger</b> <b>cones</b> used to measure and control the temperatures of ceramic furnaces, based upon research completed by the principal, Joseph Mellor. Grants from the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust in 1924 were used to develop the ceramics library and in 1926 {{the name of the}} institution was changed to North Staffordshire Technical College. By 1931 extensions to the Cadman Building ran along Station Road and housed the Mining Department. A grant was awarded from the Miners’ Welfare Fund to fund the building work. The new extension also housed the library, which by now had 35,000 volumes. By 1934 the college consisted of four departments: Engineering (nearly 800 students), Pottery (just over 600 students), Mining (just under 500 students), and Chemistry (under 300 students).|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} investigates 2 ̆ 2 middle fire 2 ̆ 2 ceramic glazes in {{the firing}} temperatures between 1100 and 1200 degrees centigrade (<b>Seger</b> <b>cones</b> 1 to 6). It addresses {{an area of}} firing temperatures that has been largely neglected over the centuries, in contrast to both earthenware and stoneware about {{which there is a}} vast amount of information available. The research shows, however, that there is evidence of a current growth of interest worldwide in midfiring for reasons of economy and ecology. The author 2 ̆ 7 s long invovement in pottery extending over forty years positions him well to develop glazes in this study which compare favourably with those in other temperature ranges. Of added significance and originality the middle fire glazes have been developed for 2 ̆ 2 once firing 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 raw glazing 2 ̆ 2 where glaze is applied to the damp pot thereby eliminating the biscuit fire. Researching the literature of ceramic studio work done both in Australia and overseas has yielded no reference to this method of glaze application at the middle fire temperatures. The combination of middle firing and raw glaze application is worthy of consideration because each part of the process saves on fuel consumption. There isa saving in costs for the potter and there are benefits to the ecology with less fossil fuels used, less greenhouse gasses created and less contribution to the possible global warming. The dissertation is of necessity a technical paper put into perspective by a brief examination of the history of glazes, as seen from the viewpoint of a potter as opposed to the traditional archaeological viewpoint. Early pottery from the Middle East, China, Japan, Korea and Europe are considered. The links between these Asian and European traditions and Australian ceramics, introduced by Bernard Leach with the publication of his APotter 2 ̆ 7 s Book, are described as the basis of Australian glaze traditions. Recipes for raw glazes firing at <b>Seger</b> <b>cones</b> 1 to 6 are listed together with descriptions of the fired results and Seger formula calculations...|$|R
40|$|Research was {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} effect of the reductive roasting conditions on the smelting characteristics of nickel laterite ores from three different areas of Greece-Evia, Viotia and Kastoria. The roasting experiments were performed in a rotary kiln at 800 degrees, 860 degrees and 900 degreesC for 10 - 90 min; the smelting experiments were carried out in an electric-arc furnace that allowed the melting temperature and energy consumption to be monitored. The melting temperature values of the ore and roast samples were also determined with a LECO AF 600 instrument by enploying the <b>Seger</b> <b>cones</b> technique. The Evia samples, in which the SiO 2 /Fe-tot ratio was higher than in the ores from Viotia and Kastoria, exhibited the highest melting temperatures. The lowest values were observed for the Kastoria samples owing to the presence of serpentine, which had a positive effect on their fusibility. Reductive roasting of the Evia and Viotia ore samples was beneficial for the subsequent smelting stage, but roasting of the Kastoria samples resulted in an increase in the melting temperature, possibly on account of the production of refractory oxides. Finally, in agreement with the generally accepted view that reductive roasting has a positive effect on the subsequent smelting operation, increases in the temperature and duration of roasting of a composite laterite ore sample resulted in lower energy consumption during the reductive smelting, which was attributed to fayalite formation...|$|R
