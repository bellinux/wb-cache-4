40|$|Abstract — Niobium-microalloyed steel {{has become}} a {{standard}} material in plate and <b>strip</b> <b>for</b> line <b>pipe,</b> automotive and construction use. The effects of controlled rolling parameters and microcontent Nb on the mechanical properties of medium carbon steels were studied in this work. For these purpose two steel grades, with and without niobium, was planed and after steelmaking and continuous casting, rolling process was done. Then, laboratory investigations such as microstructure, mechanical properties and grain size analysis were performed. Tensile and Charpy impact tests specimens were machined out of {{the central part of}} the rolled billets. The microstructure of the specimens was examined for each experimental condition using optical microscopy. The results indicate that, increasing the reheating temperature above the dissolution temperature of (Nb) (C, N) improved the impact energy values. By increasing the cooling rate from 0. 5 to 1. 5 °C/s both tensile strength and impact toughness were improved. High elongation percent was also observed on samples reheated at higher temperature and/or cooled with the higher cooling rates. The obtained mechanical properties were related to the characteristics of microstructural components including acicular ferrite, retained austenite, pearlite and ferrite...|$|R

40|$|The stress {{intensity}} factors (SIFs) <b>for</b> <b>pipes</b> containing semi-elliptical surface cracks with large aspect ratios were calculated by finite-element analysis (FEA). The cracks were circumferential and axial surface cracks inside the pipes. The {{parameters of the}} SIFs are crack aspect ratio, crack depth, and the ratio of pipe radius to wall thickness. In comparing SIFs <b>for</b> plates and <b>pipes,</b> it can be clarified that SIFs for both plates and thin pipes with t/ Ri <= 1 / 10 are almost the same, and the SIFs for plates {{can be used as}} a substitute <b>for</b> <b>pipes</b> with t/ Ri <= 1 / 10, where t is the pipe wall thickness, and Ri is the inner radius of the pipe. This means that it is not necessary to provide SIF solutions <b>for</b> <b>pipes</b> with t/ Ri <= 1 / 10, and it is suggested that the number of tables for influence coefficient values <b>for</b> <b>pipes</b> can be significantly reduced.
