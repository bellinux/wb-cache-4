30|$|In {{the same}} vein, {{the timing of}} leisure tasks and {{activities}} often depend on others. The schedules of working parents for example depend on their children’s daycare and school schedules. Informal care often has to be performed at specific {{times of the day}} (Hassink and van den Berg 2011). Stores, businesses, and public and health services have limited business and opening hours. Further education classes and recreational activities (sports, clubs, etc.) take place at designated times. Since daycare, school, office, and service hours usually cannot be altered by individual workers, they constitute a binding <b>schedule</b> <b>constraint.</b>|$|E
30|$|Both {{work and}} leisure {{activities}} thus impose a <b>schedule</b> <b>constraint</b> on workers, meaning that these activities {{can only be}} performed at specific times or within a specified time frame. Activities therefore have to be coordinated and their schedules matched. This matching can be achieved more easily the more flexible and controllable schedules are. More flexibility in work schedule and location should therefore improve the fit between work and leisure activities, prevent and eliminate time conflicts, and improve allocative efficiency (Bosch et al. 1994; Golden 2006). TLF has accordingly been shown to increase working-time fit and job satisfaction (Possenriede and Plantenga 2014).|$|E

40|$|Rats {{obtained}} all {{of their}} water by licking a metal tube during a series of daily 1 -hour sessions. When the tube was freely available throughout, each rat showed the classic temporal pattern of unconstrained drinking: As the session progressed, drinking bouts generally grew shorter and pauses grew longer. In subsequent sessions the tube was opened and closed independently of the rat's behavior, on a schedule that gave the rat a chance to duplicate the exact inverse of its unconstrained baseline pattern. Thus, as the inversion session progressed, the opportunities to drink generally grew longer and the enforced pauses grew shorter. When the rats were forced away from their unconstrained patterns of drinking and pausing, their total time spent drinking consistently fell short of previous values, but total licks and volumetric intake remained at previous levels. The same results occurred under an identity schedule, a series of openings and closings that duplicated the unconstrained pattern of drinking and pausing. The results have implications for theories that assume that instrumental performance under <b>schedule</b> <b>constraint</b> derives from the animal's defense of a measured set-point...|$|E

40|$|SABRE Travel Information Network (STIN), a {{provider}} {{of one of the}} world’s largest computer reservation systems, is trying to improve customer service levels during order processing. To address STIN’s need to improve customer service, SABRE Decision Technologies (SDT) has designed and is developing a scheduling engine for STIN’s new order scheduling decision support system called the Customer Order Scheduling System (COSS). The primary objective of COSS is to schedule orders to meet the customers ’ want dates (a want date is a requested completion time of a milestone in an order). The scheduling engine allocates equipment and human resources as it schedules milestones associated with customer orders. The engine intelligently generates schedules for all customer orders given the pool of shared resources while respecting customer specified completion dates (or want dates), user-defined scheduling rules, and customer priorities. Schedules are built based on customer priority, type of order, want date, as well as labor skill and equipment availability. For operations worldwide, STIN plans to rely on COSS for planning and scheduling support. This paper describes the current design and implementation of the COSS scheduling engine. The scheduling engine is being developed in C++ in a UNIX environment using ILOG Solver and <b>Schedule</b> <b>constraint</b> libraries. The customer priority rankings and order type rankings were implemented in the selection criteria used to decide in what order the tasks should be scheduled. 1...|$|E

30|$|However, {{due to the}} {{practical}} half-duplex (HD) constraint, in traditional protocols, the relays employ a prefixed schedule for transmission and reception, which is independent from {{the quality of the}} transmitting and receiving channels in a round of communications. The prefixed transmission and reception schedule limits the exploitation of achievable diversity degrees. Moreover, for multi-relay cooperation schemes, only the same relay node is selected for receiving data from source and forwarding data to destination in a round of communications. This prefixed schedule and the selection of the same relay in a round of communications may lead significant performance degradation in wireless systems where the qualities of the transmitting and receiving channels significantly vary with time, since it may prevent the relays from exploiting the best transmitting and the best receiving channels. Clearly, the performance of the HD relaying systems could be improved if the above constrains are relaxed. For example, by relaxing the prefixed <b>schedule</b> <b>constraint</b> for data reception and transmission, the link with the highest quality could be always used in each time slot. Similarly, by relaxing the constraint of the same relay employed in a round of communications, the systems can always select the relays with the strongest source-relay (S-R) channel and the strongest relay-destination (R-D) channel for reception and transmission, respectively. To achieve the ends, it is only possible if the relays are equipped with a buffer and can store data packets before retransmitting them later at a suitable time slot.|$|E

The 44 month schedule which the SLWT team was given for the task was ambitious by any measure. During this time the team had to not only design, build, and verify the new tank, but they also had to move a material from the early stages of development to maturity. The aluminum lithium alloy showed great promise, with an approximately 29 % increase in yield strength, 15 % increase in ultimate strength, 5 deg/O increase in modulus and 5 deg/O decrease in density when compared to the current 2219 alloy.

30|$|Early {{works of}} buffer-aided {{relaying}} {{systems can be}} founded in [14] and [15], where a three-node relaying system was considered and a data buffer was introduced at relay node. Due to the prefixed transmission and reception schedule abandoned, the results in [14] and [15] showed that the utilization of data buffer at relay can improve the throughout of relaying systems. The literature [16] focused on the multi-antenna relaying system with buffer at relay and pointed out that if the numbers of antennas at source and destination are equal or larger {{than the number of}} antennas at relay, the buffer-aided half-duplex systems can outperform the ideal full-duplex ones. Motivated by the works [14] and [15], the buffer-aided relay systems have been investigated widely such as in [17 – 25]. Later, in [26] and [27] the idea of buffer-aided relaying was expanded to multiple relay systems, where the authors have proposed the max-max link selection (MMLS) protocol firstly. Specially, to exploit the quality of relay channels as possible, the MMLS schemes abandon the restriction of using the same relay for reception and transmission in a round of communications. Because the strongest links from both S-R and R-D group channels are always selected for data transmission, respectively, the MMLS scheme has significant coding gain over the traditional max-min scheme [12]. However, the results in [26] and [27] show also that the diversity gain achieved by the max-max selection schemes is still the same as the one achieved by the T-BRS schemes owing to a prefixed transmission and reception schedule employed, such that the available diversity degree being not full exploited. Therefore, to overcome this prefixed <b>schedule</b> <b>constraint</b> and to improve the diversity gain of buffer-aided relay selection systems, in [28], the max-link selection (MLS) scheme has been proposed. In the MLS schemes, the constraint on the prefixed transmission and reception order is further relaxed so that, at any time, a best link is selected from all available source-relay and relay-destination links. Depending on whether one S-R or R-D link is selected, either source or relay transmits opportunistically a data packet to the corresponding destination. The MLS schemes incorporate the instantaneous quality of wireless links as well as the states of finite relay buffers (e.g., full, empty, neither full nor empty) and adapt the time slot allocation accordingly. It was achieved that when all relay channels obey independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Rayleigh fading, the MLS schemes not only obtain coding gain over the T-BRS and MMLS schemes but also has higher diversity gain than the two schemes. The achievable diversity order approaches two times of the one of T-BRS and MMLS schemes in the ideal case where all channels experience i.i.d fading and the size of buffers grows to infinity. In [29], the buffer-aided amplify-and-forward (AF) MLS schemes have been considered over symmetric relaying channel. With the promising MLS protocol, in [30], a hybrid cooperative relaying policy was proposed. In [31], the buffer-aided multi-relay cognitive system has been investigated.|$|E
