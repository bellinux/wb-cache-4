5|$|Indonesian {{artillery}} fire continued to rain {{down on the}} camp, wounding several men and sending the defenders into disarray. Sergeant-Major Williams rushed to the headquarters to order the artillery officer to bombard the taken positions before attempting to organise a counterattack himself. Whilst under heavy Indonesian fire, Williams gathered a section of defenders who had taken refuge in a slit trench and led them towards the captured outer positions. A shell landed among the group and wounded half of them, but Williams and the remainder engaged at least thirty Indonesian infantry who had been firing into the base from the trench in vicious hand-to-hand combat and managed to push them from it with minor casualties. Williams them looked to secure the perimeter, but seeing that the Indonesians were massing for a second attack, he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> vacated machine gun nest and sprayed {{the new wave of}} attackers, who attempted to seize the command bunker, with fire. This was not without cost, and Williams was fortunate to have escaped with a single head wound, which nevertheless blinded him in one eye, though he did not notice this in the heat of battle. Williams then began to receive supporting rifle fire from other British troops in nearby trenches, as well bombardment from the single remaining mortar and some 105mm artillery emplacements from a nearby camp.|$|E

2500|$|On August 12, 2006 Timothy James Truett of Montgomery Village {{allegedly}} made a [...] "call to Ali's {{office in}} which he asked if Ali was a Muslim and made derogatory remarks about Islam to Ali's campaign manager." [...] Afterward, Truett drove to [...] "the cul-de-sac outside Ali's Gaithersburg home, which doubles as his campaign office."

[...] Ali went out {{to look at the}} man and take pictures but did not speak to him, explaining [...] "I knew he was there to bait me." [...] Ali later recalled [...] "I felt like he was intimidating and trying to menace me and my family, similar to when people burned crosses in someone's front yard. I think it was the exact same message." [...] Ali's wife stepped outside and took pictures of Truett. [...] An older man approached Truett and offered him some water. Ali then spoke to the older man and the older man went back inside. Ali placed one of his campaign yard signs next to Truett and took a picture. [...] Truett then got up and left. Ali followed him and got pictures of his license plate. Truett then phoned Ali's office again but was hung up on. [...] Ali later posted pictures of Truett, Truett's birth date and address on his campaign web site.|$|E
