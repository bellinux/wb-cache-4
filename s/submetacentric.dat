5|$|The addax has 29 {{pairs of}} {{chromosomes}}. All chromosomes are acrocentric {{except for the}} first pair of autosomes, which are <b>submetacentric.</b> The X chromosome is {{the largest of the}} acrocentric chromosomes, and the Y chromosome is medium-sized. The short and long arms of the pair of <b>submetacentric</b> autosomes correspond respectively to the 27th and 1st chromosomes in cattle and goats. In a study, the banding patterns of chromosomes in addax were found to be similar to those in four other species of the subfamily Hippotraginae.|$|E
5|$|The {{diploid number}} of {{chromosomes}} {{in the blue}} wildebeest is 58. Chromosomes were studied in a male and a female wildebeest. In the female, all except a pair of very large <b>submetacentric</b> chromosomes {{were found to be}} acrocentric. Metaphases were studied in the male's chromosomes, and very large <b>submetacentric</b> chromosomes were found there as well, similar to those in the female both in size and morphology. the rest were acrocentric. The X chromosome is a large acrocentric while the Y chromosome a minute one.|$|E
5|$|The {{dromedary}} has 74 diploid chromosomes, {{the same}} as other camelids. The autosomes consist of five pairs of small to medium-sized metacentrics and submetacentrics.

40|$|Sylvilagus brasiliensis truei has a 2 n of 40, FN of 76, 4 {{pairs of}} {{metacentric}} chromosomes, 6 pairs of <b>submetacentrics,</b> and 9 pairs of subtelocentrics. A pair of subtelocentric chromosomes bears satellites. The X chromosome is metacentric and the Y chromosome is telocentric. All chromosomes showed distinctive G-bands. The 2 n, FN, and chromosome morphology of this rabbit from Chiapas, México, are distinctive although share some features with other Sylvilagus karyotypes...|$|R
5|$|The animal has a {{karyotype}} of 46 chromosomes, with a {{total of}} 50 major arms on the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes). The X chromosome is <b>submetacentric</b> (with one arm slightly longer than the other) and the Y chromosome is small and acrocentric (with one very short and one long arm). The karyotype is conserved among species of Miniopterus; the number of chromosomes and arms is identical in M.griveaudi, the Malagasy M.aelleni and M.gleni, and even the Asian M.fuliginosus.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} includes 80 chromosomes with a {{total of}} 86 major arms (2n=80; FN=86). The X chromosome is subtelocentric (with one pair of long arms and one pair of short arms) and the Y chromosome is acrocentric (with only one pair of arms, or with a minute second pair). Among the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes), the four metacentric or <b>submetacentric</b> (with two pairs of arms as long as or not much shorter than the other) pairs of chromosomes are small, and the 35 pairs of acrocentrics range from large to small. Some of those have a minute second pair of arms and could also be classified as subtelocentric, which would raise FN to 90. This karyotype is similar to other known karyotypes of members of Euryoryzomys.|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} of Drymoreomys albimaculatus is 2n=62, FN=62: {{the animal}} has 62 chromosomes, and 29 pairs of autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) are acrocentric (with one arm so short {{as to be}} almost invisible) and one small pair is metacentric (with two equally long arms). Both sex chromosomes are <b>submetacentric</b> (with one arm noticeably longer than the other), and X is larger than Y. Blocks of heterochromatin are present on all autosomes and the long arm of Y. Telomeric sequences are found near the centromeres of the sex chromosomes. Aspects of this karyotype—with {{a high number of}} mostly acrocentric chromosomes and the presence of heterochromatin on the Y chromosome—are consistent with the pattern seen in other oryzomyines. However, no other oryzomyine has exactly the same karyotype as D. albimaculatus. Other species in clade D have fewer chromosomes, down to 16 in Nectomys palmipes, although the karyotype of Eremoryzomys polius is unknown. This suggests an evolutionary trend of decreasing chromosome number within the clade.|$|E
40|$|Banding {{techniques}} {{were carried out}} on metaphase chromosomes of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. The karyotypes with the longest chromosomes consist of 12 metacentrics, 26 <b>submetacentrics,</b> and 12 subtelocentrics (2 n = 50). All centromeres are C-band positive. Eight chromosomes have a pericentric C-band in each arm and 22 chromosomes have one in the longest arm. Two chromosomes have a slightly heterochromatic long arm and five chromosomes have an Ag-NOR at the terminal {{end of the long}} arm.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the cytogenetic {{investigation of the}} Croatian endemic species Fibigia triquetra (DC.) Boiss. (Brassicaceae). The number of chromosomes in all investigated cells from three populations of Fibigia triquetra was 2 n= 2 x=! 6. Chromosomes were small and ranged from <b>submetacentrics</b> to acrocentrics. One chromosome pair had a relatively small satellite. Although meiosis was not completely regular, irregularities were not very frequent. Low pollen germination rate was probably due to these irregularities. As the species is perennial, weakness of seed germination seems not to be important for its survival...|$|R
50|$|Most B {{chromosomes}} {{are mainly}} or entirely heterochromatic (and {{so would be}} largely non-coding), but some, such as the B chromosomes of maize, contain sizeable euchromatic segments. In general {{it seems unlikely that}} supernumeraries would persist in a species unless there was some positive adaptive advantage, which in a few cases has been identified. For instance, the British grasshopper Myrmeleotettix maculatus has two structural types of B chromosomes: metacentrics and <b>submetacentrics.</b> The supernumeraries, which have a satellite DNA, occur in warm, dry environments, and are scarce or absent in humid, cooler localities.|$|R
5|$|The {{karyotype}} in T.talamancae is variable. Samples {{from two}} different localities in Venezuela have 34chromosomes and a fundamental number of 64 chromosomal arms (2n=34, FN=64). Four specimens from another Venezuelan locality each have a different karyotype, {{with the number of}} chromosomes ranging from 40 to 42 and the fundamental number from 66 to perhaps 67. The autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) of the 2n=34 karyotype all have two major arms, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes include several acrocentric autosomes, which only have one major arm. The 2n=34 karyotype includes two large <b>submetacentric</b> pairs, which have two long arms but one distinctly longer than the other, and one pair of subtelocentric chromosomes, with a long and a much shorter arm, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes lack the submetacentrics and have another pair of subtelocentrics. Both Robertsonian translocations (fusions of the long arm of one chromosome with the long arm of another and the short arm of the one with the short arm of the other) and pericentric inversions (reversals of part of a chromosome that includes the centromere) are needed to explain {{the difference between the two}} groups. Musser and colleagues, in discussing these karyotypes, assumed that the 2n=40–42 sample was from within a hybrid zone between two karyotypic morphs.|$|E

25|$|The {{karyotype}} of the Muscovy duck is 2n=80, {{consisting of}} {{three pairs of}} macrochromosomes, 36 pairs of microchromosomes, {{and a pair of}} sex chromosomes. The two largest macrochromosome pairs are <b>submetacentric,</b> while all other chromosomes are acrocentric or (for the smallest microchromosomes) probably telocentric. The <b>submetacentric</b> chromosomes and the Z (female) chromosome show rather little constitutive heterochromatin (C bands), while the W chromosomes are at least two-thirds heterochromatin.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Karyotypes of Sorex caecutiens from Cheju Island of Korea were {{examined}} with conventional staining and G-banding by trypsin treatment stained with Giemsa (GTG). The diploid and fundamental autosomal arm num-bers were 42 and 66, respectively. The autosomal complement in the karyotype comprised six pairs of metacentrics, seven pairs of <b>submetacentrics</b> or subtelocentrics, and seven pairs of acrocentrics. The X was a largest acrocentric chromosome, and the Y {{was a small}} subtelocentric chromosome.

40|$|The {{karyotype}} and the Ag-NOR {{location of}} a sample of Trichomycterus diabolus collected in the córrego Hortelã (Botucatu, São Paulo, Brazil) are described. The species exhibited 2 n= 56 chromosomes (42 metacentrics, 12 <b>submetacentrics</b> and 2 subtelocentrics) and the nucleolus organizing region located near to the centromere on the long arm of the largest metacentric pair. The presence of 2 n= 56 chromosomes in T. diabolus is an interesting characteristic since until now all cis-Andean species karyotyped presented 2 n= 54 chromosomes while almost all trans-Andean species presented different diploid numbers. The possible origin of this unexpected karyotypic form is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Synaptonemal complex (SC) chains were {{revealed}} in semisterile intraspecific F 1 hybrids of Ellobius tancrei Blasius, 1884 (2 n = 49, NF= 56 and 2 n= 50, NF= 56), heterozygous for Robertsonian (Rb) translocations. Chains were formed by Rb <b>submetacentrics</b> with monobrachial homology. Chromosome synapsis in spermatocytes of these hybrids was disturbed, apparently {{because of the}} problematic release of the chromosomes from the SC chains. These hybrids suffer from low fertility, and our data support the opinion that this is because a formation of Rb metacentrics with monobrachial homology within different races {{of the same species}} might be an initial event for the divergence of chromosomal forms...|$|R

500|$|The {{karyotype}} of an Ecuadorean {{sample from}} {{north of the}} Gulf of Guayaquil {{is similar to that}} of Venezuelan animals at 2n=36, FN=60; it includes four acrocentric and two subtelocentric pairs and no <b>submetacentrics.</b> In contrast, a sample from south of the Gulf had 2n=54, FN=60, including 23 pairs of acrocentrics and four pairs of metacentrics (with two equally long arms).

So, the early emerging males were haploid, with the number chromosomes in a haploid set being 30. This was in contrast with previously known data where the number of haploid chromosomes had been set at 13.

Both the X and Y chromosomes are acrocentric. [...] The study also showed that the small-toothed sportive lemur was the sportive lemur species most genetically distinct from the weasel sportive lemur, despite their similar appearance.

40|$|Karyotype, {{location}} of the nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) and heterochromatin presence and composition were studied in the Antarctic whelk Neobuccinum eatoni.

40|$|The {{chromosomes}} of specimens {{from four}} Hoplias malabaricus populations from headwaters of adjacent river basins at Ponta Grossa, southern Brazil, were investigated using differential staining techniques (C-banding, AgNO 3 and CMA 3) and fluorescent {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH) with an 18 S rDNA probe. The diploid chromosome number in representatives of all four populations was invariably 2 n = 42, with karyotypes composed of 12 pairs of metacentrics and 9 pairs of <b>submetacentrics,</b> without heteromorphic sex chromosomes. This kind of karyotype represents cytotype A in regard to cytotypes identified previously in H. malabaricus, exhibiting however, at the same time, some differences {{in the distribution of}} constitutive heterochromatin segments and in the locations of nucleolus organizer regions (NORs). The apparent karyotype similarity strongly suggests a close kinship among the studied populations, but the small differences detected in the examined chromosomal markers indicate some evolutionary divergence due to gene flow restriction among them...|$|R
500|$|There {{have been}} {{conflicting}} studies regarding the taxonomic {{status of the}} golden-crowned sifaka. When described by Simons in 1988, size, vocalizations, and karyotypes (the number and appearance of chromosomes) were compared with the other sifakas.

40|$|A {{karyotype}} {{analysis by}} several staining techniques {{was carried out}} on the great sturgeon, Huso huso (Linnaeus, 1758). The karyotype (2 n = 118 - 2) was composed of 42 pairs of meta-/submetacentric chromosomes and 17 pairs of acrocentrics/microchromosomes. Constitutive heterochromatin was mainly located at the centromeric regions of the acrocentric chromosomes. The biarmed chromosomes showed weak C-bands. Fluorescent staining with GC-specific chromomycin A 3 showed clearly recognizable fluorescent regions, whereas a more uniform base composition was revealed by the AT-specific 4, 6 -diamidino- 2 phenylindole. After Ag-staining, nucleolar organizer regions could be observed on the short arms of two medium-sized <b>submetacentrics</b> and on two acrocentrics. Digoxigenated 28 S and 5 S rDNA probes, prepared from Acipenser naccarii DNA and hybridized to metaphase chromosomes, showed signals on six and two chromosomes, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Hoplias malabaricus is {{a common}} fish species {{occurring}} in white, black and clear water rivers of the Amazon basin. Its large distribution across distinct aquatic environments can pose stressful conditions for dispersal and creates possibilities {{for the emergence of}} local adaptive profiles. We investigated the chromosomal localization of repetitive DNA markers (constitutive heterochromatin, rDNA and the transposable element REX- 3) in populations from the Amazonas river (white water), the Negro river (black water) and the Tapajós river (clear water), in order to address the variation/association of cytogenomic features and environmental conditions. We found a conserved karyotypic macrostructure with a diploid number of 40 chromosomes (20 metacentrics + 20 <b>submetacentrics)</b> in all the samples. Heteromorphism in pair 14 was detected as evidence for the initial differentiation of an XX/XY system. Minor differences detected in the amount of repetitive DNA markers are interpreted as possible signatures of local adaptations to distinct aquatic environments...|$|R
40|$|This study {{identifies}} multiple {{copies of}} the AML 1 gene on a duplicated chromosome 21, dup(21), as a recurrent abnormality in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Clusters of AML 1 signals were visible at interphase by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH). In metaphase, they appeared tandemly duplicated on marker chromosomes of five distinct morphological types: large or small acrocentrics, metacentrics, <b>submetacentrics</b> or rings. The markers comprised only chromosome 21 material. Karyotypes were near-diploid and, besides dup(21), no other established chromosomal changes were observed. A total of 20 patients, 1. 5 and < 0. 5 % among consecutive series of childhood and adult ALL respectively, showed this phenomenon. Their median age was 9 years, white cell counts were low and all had a pre-B/common immunophenotype.
