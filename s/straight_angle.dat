25|$|Angles whose sum is a <b>straight</b> <b>angle</b> are supplementary. Supplementary angles {{are formed}} when a ray shares the same vertex and is pointed in a {{direction}} that is in between the two original rays that form the <b>straight</b> <b>angle</b> (180 degree angle). The number of rays in between the two original rays is infinite.|$|E
25|$|Such simple {{expressions}} {{generally do}} not exist for other angles which are rational multiples of a <b>straight</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Euclidean geometry, any sum of two angles in a {{triangle}} is supplementary to the third, because {{the sum of}} internal angles of {{a triangle}} is a <b>straight</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The sum of {{the angles}} of a {{triangle}} is equal to a <b>straight</b> <b>angle</b> (180 degrees). This causes an equilateral triangle to have 3 interior angles of 60 degrees. Also, it causes every triangle {{to have at least}} 2 acute angles and up to 1 obtuse or right angle.|$|E
25|$|Most Duployan letters cursively {{connect to}} any {{adjacent}} letters. Circle vowels will sometimes reduce to {{as small as}} a semi-circle in order to accommodate the incoming and outgoing strokes of adjacent letters, and orienting vowels will rotate to meet the preceding letter at a <b>straight</b> <b>angle,</b> while mirroring to present themselves to the following letter.|$|E

25|$|Even when fully {{extended}} (straightened) at the elbow, the forearm did not form a <b>straight</b> <b>angle,</b> falling short of this by 22°. Pronation (twisting {{to make the}} palmar side of the hand face downwards) of the forearm was impossible, because the radius and ulna lacked rolling surfaces, meaning the forearm was in a permanent state of supination.|$|E

50|$|The <b>straight</b> <b>angles</b> and boxy {{appearance}} of the buildings exterior is a common element of the international-style architecture that defines the Petroleum Tower. One of the most unique characteristics of the building that makes it {{stand out from the}} buildings around it is that it was built during the post-war era. Construction began in 1958 and was completed in 1959.|$|R
2500|$|Angles {{larger than}} a right angle and smaller than a <b>straight</b> <b>angle</b> (between 90° and 180°) are called obtuse angles ("obtuse" [...] meaning [...] "blunt").|$|E
2500|$|Adjacent angles, often {{abbreviated}} as adj. ∠s, are angles {{that share}} a common vertex and edge but do not share any interior points. In other words, they are angles that are side by side, or adjacent, sharing an [...] "arm". Adjacent angles which sum to a right angle, <b>straight</b> <b>angle</b> or full angle are special and are respectively called complementary, supplementary and explementary angles (see [...] "Combine angle pairs" [...] below).|$|E
2500|$|A {{reference}} {{angle is}} the acute version of any angle determined by repeatedly subtracting or adding <b>straight</b> <b>angle</b> ( [...] turn, 180°, or [...] radians), {{to the results}} as necessary, until the magnitude of result is an acute angle, a value between 0 and [...] turn, 90°, or [...] radians. For example, an angle of 30 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees, and an angle of 150 degrees also has a reference angle of 30 degrees (180 – 150). An angle of 750 degrees has a reference angle of 30 degrees (750 – 720).|$|E

50|$|Unlike Euclidean triangles, {{where the}} angles always {{add up to}} π radians (180°, a <b>straight</b> <b>angle),</b> in {{hyperbolic}} geometry {{the sum of the}} angles of a hyperbolic triangle is always strictly less than π radians (180°, a <b>straight</b> <b>angle).</b> The difference {{is referred to as the}} defect.|$|E

50|$|The Logos Tetrahedron is {{a concert}} hall in Ghent, Belgium {{adjacent}} to the foundation's recording studio and offices. It has seating for 150 people and is equipped with sound and light infrastructure. Since the concert hall is {{in the shape of}} a tetrahedron, it has no <b>straight</b> <b>angles</b> and, as a result, no standing waves can occur. Acoustic waves can never amplify one another in phase and are reflected by the walls under ever changing angles.|$|R
50|$|Danish Functionalists focused {{primarily}} on functionality {{at the expense of}} aesthetics and produced a number of buildings that are characterized by <b>straight</b> <b>angles,</b> flat roofs, were characteristic of Brutalist architecture by virtue of the minimally decorated concrete slabs that the buildings themselves are made of. A fine example of the Danish Functionalist style is Aarhus University designed by the architect C. F. Møller. Danish architects such as Kaare Klint and Arne Jacobsen extended their approach to the furniture now known as Danish modern.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method to {{determine}} which sym-bols are probable {{to be found in}} technical drawings using vectorial signa-tures. These signatures are formulated in terms of geometric and struc-tural constraints between segments, as parallelisms, <b>straight</b> <b>angles,</b> etc. After representing vectorized line drawings with attributed graphs, our approach works with a multi-scale representation of these graphs, re-trieving the features that are expressive enough to create the signature. Since the proposed method integrates a distortion model, it can be used either with scanned and then vectorized drawings or with hand-drawn sketches. ...|$|R
50|$|Shear {{mappings}} {{must not}} be confused with rotations. Applying a shear map to a set of points of the plane will change all angles between them (except <b>straight</b> <b>angles),</b> and the length of any line segment that is not parallel to the direction of displacement. Therefore it will usually distort the shape of a geometric figure, for example turning squares into non-square parallelograms, and circles into ellipses. However a shearing does preserve the area of geometric figures and the alignment and relative distances of collinear points. A shear mapping is the main difference between the upright and slanted (or italic) styles of letters.|$|R
