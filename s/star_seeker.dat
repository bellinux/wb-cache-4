50|$|Although G.rev had {{previously}} produced an arcade puzzle game, Doki Doki Idol <b>Star</b> <b>Seeker,</b> Border Down was the project G.rev formed to make. Upon establishing his independent company, G.rev president Hiroyuki Maruyama lamented that he didn't have the finances to fund his vision. By doing subcontracted work for Treasure and Taito, and releasing a simple puzzle game, G.rev {{was able to}} generate the revenue needed to create Border Down.|$|E
50|$|G.rev {{was founded}} {{with the mission}} of {{developing}} arcade shooters, but they realized the cost of development was more than their initial investment capital.

This relationship would remain fruitful, with G.rev assisting again on Gradius V, and Ikaruga director Hiroshi Iuchi assisting on G.rev's own Strania.

Recovering the weapon from within the planet, the Decepticons attached it to the Nemesis and engaged the Autobots in battle. However, the Requiem Blaster proved too powerful to utilize more than once, prompting the Decepticons to jettison it. After dueling Optimus Prime, who wielded the legendary Cyber Caliber, Megatron was confronted by {{another member of the}} Thirteen: Nexus Prime. During his battle with Optimus, he briefly saw into his opponent's mind and got a sense of the direction in which to seek the AllSpark, a legendary artifact jettisoned from Cybertron by Optimus to keep it out of Megatron's hands. Megatron and his forces set out in search of it, but ran afoul of a crew of <b>Star</b> <b>Seeker</b> pirates led by Thundertron, who engaged the Decepticons in a heated battle before withdrawing.|$|E
