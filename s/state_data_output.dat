40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we develop}} data-based methods {{to analyze the}} {{characteristics}} of linear discrete-time systems, which have unknown parameter matrices. These characteristics include output controllability, asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point, bounded-input bounded-state stability, and bounded-input bounded-output stability. Our methods only use measured <b>state</b> and <b>output</b> <b>data</b> to verify the system properties. They are direct analysis methods and {{do not need to}} identify the unknown parameter matrices. These data-based methods not only can avoid identification errors, but also have lower computational complexity than traditional model-based analysis approaches...|$|R

The multimedia database system must guarantee that the stored multimedia data and the <b>data</b> <b>output</b> of multimedia <b>data</b> are according to the defined output constraints. For that an efficient check of output constraints must be possible. 1...|$|R
