40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the thermal sum of the different stages of development of potato plants to better understand its relationship with <b>tuber</b> <b>sprouting.</b> The potato clones SMIJ 461 - 1, SMINIA 793101 - 3 and SMINIA 97145 - 2 and the cultivar Macaca were evaluated in spring and autumn crop seasons in Santa Maria and Julio de Castilhos, RS. Emergence (EM), tuber initiation (TI) and onset of senescence (OS) of the plants were determined and the accumulated thermal sum (aTS) was calculated in each phase. After harvesting, tubers were stored at 20 oC for 15 days for curing and then stored at 10 or 20 °C to quantify the percentage of <b>sprouted</b> <b>tubers</b> {{and the number of}} <b>sprouts</b> per <b>tuber</b> at 0, 30, 60 and 90 days of storage. The experiment was a factorial of four potato clones and two growth conditions, season and storage temperature, in a random design with four replications of 20 tubers. The environmental conditions of Julio de Castilhos in the spring resulted in a greater aTS from EM and TI to OS than those of Santa Maria, meaning that different crop locations and even seasons should be considered for making inferences about <b>tuber</b> <b>sprouting</b> based upon aTS. The management of storage temperature can promote or retard <b>tuber</b> <b>sprouting,</b> but its effect depends on the potato clone. Based upon combined correlation estimations, the aTS between EM-OS or between TI-OS is a good estimator for potato <b>tuber</b> <b>sprouting...</b>|$|R

This study presents a detailed molecular analysis using nextgeneration sequencing (NGS), IC-RT-qPCR and RT-PCR on the PVY isolates infecting seed-tubers and foliage of potato plants cv. Diacol-Capiro in La Union (Antioquia, Colombia). Analysis of incidence by IC-RT-qPCR in 15 random leaf samples of three cultivation plots and fifteen <b>sprouting</b> <b>tuber</b> eye-buds reveal infection levels between 13. 4 and 80 %; a higher incidence of 86. 7 % was observed in seed-tuber samples with threshold cycle (Ct) values as low as 24. 3. Genome assembly from a bulk of foliage samples resulted in a consensus PVY genome (PVY_LaUnionF) of 9, 702 nt and 399 polymorphic sites within the polyprotein ORF; while the assembled genome from <b>sprouts</b> of <b>tubers</b> has 9, 704 nt (PVY_LaUnionT) and contained only six polymorphic nucleotide sites. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that the PVY isolates from leaf samples are in the recombinant PVYNTN group (sequence identity > 99 %); while those from <b>tuber</b> <b>sprouts</b> are in the PVYN/NTN group with identities above 95 %.

40|$|Effects of {{gibberellic}} acid (GA 3) on dormancy termination, sprouting {{and quality of}} potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) seed tubers stored for 12 weeks in Diffused Light Store (DLS) and for 2 weeks in pit were determined. Potato genotypes (Tigoni, Asante, Dutch Robyjn, Kenya Karibu and Kenya Sifa) and GA 3 at 0, 10, 20 and 30 mg kg - 1 were used. Dormancy period was reduced to three weeks in all genotypes except Kenya Sifa, which sprouted after seven weeks following GA 3 treatments in DLS. Increasing GA 3 concentrations increased sprouting (%), number of <b>sprouts</b> per <b>tuber,</b> <b>sprout</b> length and vigor score. However differences among GA 3 concentrations for these parameters were not observed. In the pit, the potato seed <b>tubers</b> <b>sprouted</b> within the two weeks of storage. Except for Kenya Sifa, GA 3 {{had no effect on}} sprouting and vigor score; however, it increased number of <b>sprouts</b> per <b>tuber</b> and <b>sprout</b> length. Increase in GA 3 concentration led to increase in rotting at 30 mg kg - 1 of GA 3 for Tigoni, Kenya Sifa and Kenya Karibu genotypes, under DLS.

40|$|Activities of enzymes presumably {{involved}} in starch biosynthesis (ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, AGPase) and/or breakdown (starch phosphorylase, STP; amylases) were determined during potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) <b>tuber</b> dormancy and <b>sprouting.</b> Overall activities {{of all these}} enzymes decreased during {{the first stage of}} tuber dormancy. No clear changes were detected at the time of dormancy breaking and sprouting. However, when AGPase activity was monitored by in situ staining during the entire dormancy period, a clear decrease during the dormant period and a large increase before visible sprouting could be observed. This increase was especially evident near the vascular tissue and at the apical bud, which showed a very intensive staining. In situ staining of STP activity in <b>sprouting</b> <b>tubers</b> showed that the tissue distribution of STP was the same as for AGPase. As a possible explanation, direct starch cycling is suggested: STP produces glucose- 1 -phosphate during starch breakdown, which can be directly used as a substrate by AGPase for starch synthesis. Gene expression studies with the AGPaseS promoter coupled to the firefly luciferase reporter gene also clearly showed a higher activity in <b>sprouting</b> <b>tubers</b> as compared to dormant tubers, with the highest expression levels observed around the apical buds. The presence of amylase activity at dormancy initiation and AGPase activity persistent at the sprouting stage suggest that starch was cycling throughout the entire dormancy period. According to the in situ studies, the AGPase activity increased well before visible sprout growth and could therefore {{be one of the first}} physiological determinants of dormancy breakage...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to examine and evaluate the effects of several modifications of ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) technique on the detection of potato viruses Y, A, X, S and potato leafroll virus by this technique. These modifications consisted on: modification of the incubation modality of conjugate (IgG-AP), the use of several additives in extraction buffer, replacement of grinding buffer with McIlvain buffer. The results show a better identification of PLRV in leaves and <b>sprouting</b> <b>tubers</b> using the co-incubation sample and IgG-AP conjugate. Compared with the classical method, the test safety and sensitivity increased. Testing leaves, the average values of OD at 405 nm was 5 - 6, 6 times higher than those obtained by standard DAS ELISA method and using sap from <b>sprouting</b> <b>tubers</b> (dilution 1 / 10) this average was 1, 5 times higher. The detection of potato viruses Y and A by enzyme–linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can be improved using extraction buffers with new composition. Using McIlvain’s phosphate-citric acid buffer (0, 18 M; pH 7), the absorbance values (A 405 nm) increased significantly for PVY and PVA detection comparing with the classic extraction buffer. Sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (0. 01 M) in phosphate-buffered saline plus Tween 20 (PBS-T) used instead of the polyvinylpyrrolidone increased the sensitivity of potato virus Y but this additives decrease the absorbance values in case of PLRV identification. The same decrease was observed when we used sodium thioglicolat (0. 01 M) and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (0. 01 M) in PBS-T. The co-incubation sample and conjugate and the use of McIlvain’s buffer could save time and costs of potato viruses diagnostic tests...|$|R

A factorial experiment based on completely randomized block design with three replications was conducted to investigate the effect of two temperature levels (18 and 25 °C) and six hormone treatments (H 1 : 0 % of ethanol + 0 mg/l of gibberellic acid, H 2 : 0 % of ethanol + 10 mg/l of gibberellic acid, H 3 : 0. 5 % of ethanol + 0 mg/l of gibberellic acid, H 4 : 0. 5 % of ethanol + 10 mg/l of gibberellic acid, H 5 : 0. 5 % of ethanol + 20 mg/l of gibberellic acid, H 6 : 0. 5 % of ethanol + 30 mg/l of gibberellic acid) on mini tubers of two varieties of potato (Agria and Santé). The longest sprouts were about 14. 13 mm long and they were produced by Santé variety at 18 °C and H 1 hormone level. Sprouting percentage was higher in Santé (75. 69 %) than in Agria (59. 72 %). The highest average percentage of <b>sprouted</b> <b>tubers</b> (95 %) was achieved at the temperature of 18 °C and with H 4 hormone treatment.

30|$|Post-harvest biodeterioration of ware yam largely {{starts from}} the field, {{resulting}} from the injuries on yam tubers before storage. The invading fungal pathogens are subsequently carried from the field to the yam barn. In most cases, these infections are latent and only become noticed after incubation and the infected tubers start to rot. However, besides human activities, insects pests, rodents and nematodes that predispose yam tubers to rot, other factors such as <b>sprouting,</b> <b>tuber</b> respiration, temperature {{and the degree of}} resistance or susceptibility of yam genotypes to invading pathogens also influence yam storage. Cultural practices such as continuous cropping also encourage the persistence of yam pathogens and enhance their transition from the previous cropping season to the next season. Temperature influences yam storability. Yams store best at 28 [*]±[*] 2 °C in Nigeria. Although storage at lower temperaturs reduces microbial rotting, it causes chilling damage to yam tubers. Storage at temperatures higher than 30 °C increases the incidence of xerophilic fungi like Aspergillus niger and Penillium oxalicum. Therefore, correct manipulation of temperature during storage can also prolong the shelf life of ware yam.|$|R

40|$|Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) microtubers or field-grown tubers have a dormant apical bud (also called tuber dormancy). They do {{not readily}} sprout even if {{environmental}} conditions are favorable, including optimum temperature and humidity. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the involvement of hydrogen peroxide (by direct or indirect application of thiourea, a catalase inhibitor) in dormancy release and sprouting of potato microtubers and tubers was evaluated using two complementary experiments. First, the kinetics of the sprouting (percentage of sprouted microtubers with time) was examined on microtubers planted in peat and cultivated in a glasshouse after exogenous application of different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (20, 40 and 60 mM) and thiourea (250, 50 0 and 750 mM). Second, the sprouting kinetics was examined on field-grown tubers during storage, after application of hydrogen peroxide (20, 40, 60 and 80 mM) and thiourea (250, 500, 750 and 1000 mM). Their sprouting capacity was also evaluated. Then, kinetics of field emergence of treated and <b>sprouted</b> <b>tubers</b> was examined after planting them in a field. Direct application of hydrogen peroxide or application of catalase inhibition through thiourea application on the release of dormancy promote sprouting on potato microtubers and field-grown tubers.

40|$|Two major {{classes of}} {{protease}} are shown {{to occur in}} germinating winged-bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus) seeds, by assaying extracts at pH 8. 0 and pH 5. 1 with [14 C]gelatin as substrate. At pH 8. 0, the activity profile of the enzyme shows a steady rise throughout the period of germination, whereas the activity at the acidic pH is very low up to day 5 and then increases sharply reaching a peak on day 11, followed by an equally sharp decline. The winged-bean acidic protease (WbAP) has been purified to apparent homogeneity, as attested by a single protein band on both PAGE and SDS/PAGE. WbAP is a monomeric enzyme with a molecular mass of 35 kDa and a pH optimum of 6. 0. It is a thiol protease that {{does not belong to}} the papain family and it has tightly bound Ca 2 + as shown by 45 Ca(2 +) -exchange studies.

40|$|The {{level of}} jasmonic acid (JA) in {{medullary}} tissues of intact potato tubers {{was found to}} be very low [ca. 4 ng (g fr wt) " 1]. When the tissues were excised and incubated on moistened filter paper, the level of JA began to increase rapidly, reached a maximum 4 h after excision and de-creased thereafter. The maximum level of JA observed after 4 h was 450 ng (g fr wt) ~'. The level of JA-related compounds, as estimated by a bioassay for potato tuber-inducing activity, showed similar fluctuations to those in the level of JA, and neither methyl jasmonate nor tuberonic acid could be detected in the tissues at any time. These results suggest that the increase in the level of JA is due to the synthesis of JA and the decrease is due to the degradation of JA. The accumula-tion of JA was found only in tissues of dormant tubers that had been stored for less than 5 months and not in those of <b>sprouting</b> <b>tubers.</b> Two inhibitors of animal phospholipase A 2, name-ly, manoalide and quinacrine, did not inhibit the accumulation of JA, a result that suggests that activation of phospholipase A 2 is not involved in the synthesis of JA.

In plants, three isoamylase isoforms with distinct functions in starch synthesis (ISA 1 and ISA 2) and degradation (ISA 3) have been described. Here, we created transgenic potato plants with simultaneously decreased expression of all three isoamylases using a chimeric RNAi construct targeting all three isoforms. Constitutive expression of the hairpin RNA using the 35 S CaMV promoter resulted in efficient silencing of all three isoforms in leaves, growing <b>tubers,</b> and <b>sprouting</b> <b>tubers.</b> Neither plant growth nor tuber yield was effected in isoamylase-deficient potato lines. Interestingly, starch metabolism {{was found to be}} impaired in a tissue-specific manner. While leaf starch content was unaffected, tuber starch was significantly reduced. The reduction in tuber starch content in the transgenic plants was accompanied by a decrease in starch granules size, an increased sucrose content and decreased hexose levels. Despite the effects on granule size, only little changes in chain length composition of soluble and insoluble glucose polymers were detected. The transgenic tubers displayed an early sprouting phenotype that was accompanied by an increased level of sucrose in parenchyma cells below the outgrowing bud. Since high sucrose levels promote sprouting, we propose that the increased number of small starch granules may cause an accelerated turnover of glucan chains and hence a more rapid synthesis of sucrose.

In this study, yam tubers bought from markets in six West African countries were planted in an insect proof screen-house.

However, its productivity is low owing {{to a number of}} constraints including a) limited availability of quality planting materials, and b) poor <b>tuber</b> <b>sprouting</b> due to long dormancy period of improved varieties at the time of planting. Two consecutive experiments were conducted from November 2013 to June 2014 : 1) to assess the effects of gibberellic acid (GA 3) and storage methods on seed tuber dormancy breakage of two potato varieties; and 2) to assess the effects of dormancy breakage treatments and storage methods on subsequent growth, yield and related traits of potato crop. The treatments in the first experiment consisted of two potato varieties (Bubu and Bate), three levels of GA 3 [0, 10 and 20 parts per million (ppm) ], and three storage methods [in diffused light store (DLS), in pit store (PS), and in farm-yard manure (FYM) ]. The first trial was laid out as a complete randomized design with four replications and conducted at Haramaya University, Ethiopia. The second trial consisted of seed from each treatment in the first experiment, planted in randomized complete block design with three replications on a farmers’ field. The results showed that varieties, application of GA 3 and storage methods as well as the interaction among the variety and treatments significantly affected <b>tuber</b> dormancy period, <b>sprouting</b> characteristics and subsequent tuber yield. When tubers were treated with 20 ppm GA 3 and stored under FYM, the dormancy period was reduced from 102. 5 and 52 to 36. 5 and 31 days in improved and farmer’s variety, respectively. Tuber treatment with 20 ppm GA 3 and stored under DLS, PS, and FYM, increased marketable tuber yield by 31. 6 %, 29. 6 %, and 33. 6 %, respectively for Bubu variety and by 92. 5 %, 78. 4 %, and 80. 9 % for Bate variety, respectively compared to non-GA 3 treated tubers stored under DLS, PS, and FYM. However, tubers of improved variety Bubu treated with 20 ppm GA 3 and stored under DLS produced the highest marketable tuber yield of 34. 20 ton per ha. Tuber quality attributes (specific gravity, dry matter, and total starch content) were affected only due to interaction effects of variety and GA 3 application with the highest values at 20 ppm GA 3 for improved potato variety Bubu. In general, the research indicated that treating seed tubers with GA 3 and storing under DLS, PS or FYM promoted early <b>tuber</b> <b>sprouting</b> and better <b>tuber</b> yield of both varieties.

The harvested progeny tubers were inoculated with Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. brasiliense. Calcium amendment increased the activities of enzymes (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, polyphenol oxidase and peroxidases) involved in the metabolism of phenolics and total soluble phenols. Calcium amendment significantly reduced (P < 0. 05) the maceration effect of P. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense in tuber tissues. Chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and calcium, but not ferulic acid content were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) in plants grown in calcium treated plots. Calcium positively and significantly correlated with polyphenol oxidase (PPO), phenylalanine (PAL) and peroxidase (POD), while chlorogenic and caffeic acid showed a positive relationship with POD and PPO. Calcium amendment significantly reduced maceration symptom caused by the bacteria (P < 0. 05), resulting in smaller decayed zone diameters on inoculated tubers from calciumtreated plots. This study shows that soil amendments of calcium increase concentration of calcium, caffeic and chlorogenic acid in tuber peels and also reduces maceration effect of pectinolytic pathogens. Reduced maceration could be due to increased levels of caffeic and chlorogenic acid which have antimicrobial properties. [URL]...|$|R

In {{addition}} to stimulate vegetative growth of Cyperus rotundus by cutting off chains of tubers, the rotary hoe (Rotavator) {{is able to}} cut off pieces of tubers. Consequently, {{the objective of this}} trial, conducted in New Caledonia, is to study the development of halves of tubers cut lengthwise or widthwise. Forty eight days after planting, halves of tubers cut lengthwise or widthwise produce as many rhizomes, new <b>tubers,</b> <b>sprouts</b> as entire <b>tubers.</b> Because of reserves of nutrients reduced by 50 %, halves of tubers cut lengthwise or widthwise produce less biomasses than entire tubers. Halves of tubers cut widthwise, by developing a bit more rapidly than halves of tubers cut lengthwise, seem to highlight the tuber's organogenesis. Finally, a tuber when is cut in half produce two viable pieces of tubers. Consequently, the use of sharp tools during new ploughing, as the rotary hoe, can increase directly the numbers of tubers in the soil. This result implies a reasonable use of tools during tillage or ploughing for a better control of C. rotundus...|$|R
40|$|Starch is {{the most}} {{abundant}} carbohydrate reserve in plants and is found in leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, different types of stems and roots. Starch is used by plants as source of carbon and energy (Smith, 2001). The biochemical chain responsible for starch synthesis involves glucose molecules produced in plant cells by photosynthesis. Starch is formed in the chloroplasts of green leaves and amyloplasts, organelles responsible for the starch reserve synthesis of cereals and tubers (Smith, 2001; Tester et  al., 2004). Starch production in the chloroplast is diurnal and performed rapidly by the plant. Conversely, starch reserves produced by amyloplasts are deposited over several days, or even weeks. Starch is stored and cyclically mobilized during seed germination, fruit maturation and the <b>sprouting</b> of <b>tubers</b> (Ellis et al., 1998). The main location of starch synthesis and storage in cereals is the endosperm. Major starch source...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine sprouting on potato seed tuber over a range of different temperature and moisture conditions. The Experiment was conducted under controlled environment conditions using a Terratec thermo-gradient table at the School of Agricultural Science, University of Tasmania. The trial involved exposing seed tubers cv. Russet Burbank (grade 40 - 60 g) sourced from one seed lot to three water potentials (- 0. 6 MPa, - 0. 02 MPa and - 0. 01 MPa) at each of four different temperatures (10, 15, 20 and 25 ??C). The growth medium used in the trial was vermiculite (Grade 2, Australian vermiculite and Perlite Co-P/L). The water potential treatments were prepared based on the relationship of water content and water potential by Whalley et al. (2001). Four seed tubers were planted in each container filled with growth medium at a 10 cm depth and covered by the growth medium before the containers were resealed. Using a pseudo replication design with temperature as the block, the moisture treatments were randomized within each temperature treatment with two replicate containers for each treatment combination. The design therefore provided a total of 8 tubers for each temperature and water potential combination, and a total of 24 treatment combinations overall. An analysis of variance and least significant difference (LSD) procedure using SPSS for windows version 14. 0 was performed to determine the response of the tuber seeds to temperature and moisture. Temperature and moisture significantly affected sprout growth rate, assessed as the sprouting capacity of the <b>tubers</b> (FW <b>sprouts</b> per FW <b>tubers).</b> <b>Sprouting</b> capacity of seed tubers increased with increasing temperature and water potential. There was a significant interaction between temperature and moisture treatments on the sprouting capacity (p< 0. 05). The differences between water potential treatments were greater at higher temperature, with differences between <b>sprouting</b> capacity of <b>tubers</b> exposed to dry and wet conditions particularly evident at temperatures of 20 and 25 ??C.

40|$|This study investigates {{respiration}} rate of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) under real and experimental storage conditions. Real storage conditions {{were obtained by}} building a small-scale storage facility equipped with two independent storage bins including all controls. Each bin was filled with 2. 5 metric tons of potatoes and these were stored for five months. Temperature, relative humidity, air flowrate and other operational parameters were collected. Also, mass loss and CO 2 analyses were performed. A heat and moisture balance was applied to quantify heat and moisture rates produced by potatoes and were converted to {{respiration rate}}s as CO 2 produced (ml. kg- 1. h- 1). Evaporation rates were also determined (g. kg- 1. h - 1). The balance was mainly applied on data collected from specific periods in which steady conditions were imposed; heaters and humidifiers were turned off and fans were operated to circulate air at a given flowrate for more than 8 h/day over a two month period. Respiration rates were determined as rates of heat produced (W) with stability and acceptable accuracy for a relatively large facility. Respiration rates were converted to CO 2 production (ml. kg- 1. h- 1), and these agreed fairly with ranges reported in the literature. Simultaneously, respiration rates were measured by in-store CO 2 analysis, and later they were measured under laboratory conditions using a closed gas analysis system. Comparing these with rates obtained by the heat and moisture balance, the later were slightly higher. Mass losses were also obtained by both weight losses and moisture balance; results from the two methods were quite similar and comparable with those reported in the literature. Under experimental conditions, respiration rates were measured for healthy, diseased and <b>sprouted</b> <b>tubers</b> using a gas analysis method. This experiment demonstrated {{the need for a}} more extensive investigation of disease development and its relation to respiration rates, and the need for a faster and more convenient gas analysis system.

40|$|Sprouting {{regulation}} in potato tubers {{is important for}} improving commercial value and producing new plants. Camphor shows flexible inhibition of <b>tuber</b> <b>sprouting</b> and prolongs the storage period of potato, but its underlying mechanism remains unknown. The {{results of the present}} study suggest that camphor inhibition caused bud growth deformities and necrosis, but after moving to more ventilated conditions, new sprouts grew from the bud eye of the tuber. Subsequently, the sucrose and fructose contents as well as polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity were assessed after camphor inhibition. Transcription and proteomics data from dormancy (D), sprouting (S), camphor inhibition (C), and recovery sprouting (R) samples showed changes in the expression levels of approximately 4000 transcripts, and 700 proteins showed different abundances. KEGG (Kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes) pathway analysis of the transcription levels indicated that phytohormone synthesis and signal transduction play important roles in <b>tuber</b> <b>sprouting.</b> Camphor inhibited these processes, particularly for gibberellic acid, brassinosteroids, and ethylene, leading to dysregulation of physiological processes such as cutin, suberine and wax biosynthesis, fatty acid elongation, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and starch and sucrose metabolism, resulting in bud necrosis and prolonged storage periods. The KEGG pathway correlation between transcripts and proteins revealed that terpenoid backbone biosynthesis and plant–pathogen interaction pathways showed significant differences in D vs. S samples, but 13 pathways were remarkably different in the D vs. C groups, as camphor inhibition significantly increased both the transcription levels and protein abundance of pathogenesis-related protein PR- 10 a (or STH- 2), the pathogenesis-related P 2 -like precursor protein, and the kirola-like protein as compared to sprouting. In recovery sprouting, these genes and proteins were decreased at both the transcriptional level and in protein abundance. It was important to find that the inhibitory effect of camphor on potato <b>tuber</b> <b>sprout</b> was reversible, revealing the action mechanism was similar to resistance to pathogen infection. The present study provides a theoretical basis for the application of camphor in prolonging seed potato storage...|$|R

50|$|The {{length of}} time that sweet {{potatoes}} may be stored is highly dependent on temperature and relative humidity. Storage in temperatures less than 10 C will cause chill injury in sweet potatoes. This is characterized by discoloration of the insides of the tuber, which can range from brown to black {{instead of the usual}} orange. Formation of hard areas also occurs that remain even after cooking. Other signs of chill injury include production of off flavours, internal cell structure breakdown and increased rotting due to reduced skin formation, which allows fungal infection. On {{the other end of the}} scale, temperatures above 16 C will cause a rise in the rates of respiration and <b>sprouting</b> in <b>tubers</b> as well as increased activity by microorganisms. Relative humidity under 80% will cause excessive water loss while RH above 90% will cause condensation to form, which accelerates rotting.|$|R

Nutsedges occur in irrigated spring and summer crops in Portugal. Their <b>tubers</b> <b>sprout</b> readily at high temperatures. Their growth is strongly influenced by ambiental conditions. The conditions at Hohenheim (Germany) were unfavourable to the growth and multiplication of the nutsedges. At Oeiras, the nutsedges emerged in April and May grew slowly at the beginning, those emerged in June and July grew rapidly, those emerged in August and September grew poorly. Shade reduced growth significantly. The varieties of C. esculentus of France and Holland found favourable conditions to their growth. The nutsedges interfered with mais but the yield was not totally lost. Fertilization reduced the competition ability of the nutsedges. C. rotundus seems to have less competition ability than C. esculentus. Some herbicides are able to control the nutsedges in some crops.
