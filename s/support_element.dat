The Marine Wing Support Groups were disestablished in 2012, with headquarters personnel and Marine Wing Support Squadrons {{distributed to the}} Marine Aircraft Groups.|$|E
25|$|Slovak Ground Forces {{are made}} up of two active {{mechanised}} infantry brigades. The Air and Air Defence Forces comprise one wing of fighters, one wing of utility helicopters, and one SAM brigade. Training and support forces comprise a National <b>Support</b> <b>Element</b> (Multifunctional Battalion, Transport Battalion, Repair Battalion), a garrison force of the capital city Bratislava, as well as a training battalion, and various logistics and communication and information bases. Miscellaneous forces under the direct command of the General Staff include the 5th Special Forces Regiment.|$|E

While divisions were the traditional level at which <b>support</b> <b>elements</b> (field artillery, hospital, logistics and maintenance, etc.) {{were added to the}} unit structure, since World War II, many brigades now have such support units, and since the 1980s, regiments also have been receiving <b>support</b> <b>elements.</b> A regiment with such <b>support</b> <b>elements</b> is called a regimental combat team in US military parlance, or a battle group in the UK and other forces.|$|R

25|$|Compulsory {{military}} service was abolished in 1967 and the 1st Infantry Battalion was established, {{consisting of a}} headquarters and services unit, two motorized infantry companies, and a reconnaissance company with two reconnaissance (recce) platoons and an anti-tank platoon. From 1968 onwards, it formed a part of NATO’s ACE Mobile Force (Land) (AMF(L)). In 1985, a reinforced company—consisting of an AMF Company with two recce platoons and an anti-tank platoon, a forward air-control team, a national <b>support</b> <b>element</b> for logistics, and a medical support element—replaced the battalion. In 2002 the AMF(L) was dissolved.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) and its {{supporting}} units is closely interwoven. In March 1977, General Louis H. Wilson, the 26th Commandant of the Marine Corps, activated the EAF. The initial unit placed {{in charge of the}} EAF was designated Detachment MABS-11. Two years later, in July 1979, Detachment MABS-11 became operationally attached to Marine Wing Support Group 37 (MWSG-37) and was redesignated MWSG-37, Detachment Bravo in 1982. Originally, only a cadre of Marines provided caretaker support for the EAF between exercises. However, during October 1988 MWSS-173 was transferred from MCAS Kaneohe Bay to the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, Twentynine Palms in support of the EAF. On 4 March 1993, MWSS-173 was deactivated and Aviation Ground <b>Support</b> <b>Element</b> (AGSE) was activated to continue operating and maintaining the EAF. On 1 April 1999, AGSE deactivated and was redesignated as Marine Wing Support Squadron 374(- reinforced) (MWSS-374). Currently the squadron is over 700 strong, and possesses the ability to operate a tactical airfield including air traffic control services and maintaining ground and weapons support equipment for aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Behind the scenes, the {{composition}} of the force Australia would contribute was not agreed in principle until late 1978; options discussed at the time were a logistic force and an infantry battalion group. By October 1978 Prime Minister Fraser had publicly stated that he wanted to send a peacekeeping force to Namibia; however, this was not broadly supported. A November 1978 article in The Bulletin claimed that the Defence Department was [...] "dead against" [...] a commitment, and in January 1979 The Daily Telegraph and The Canberra Times reported that Fraser, Andrew Peacock (Foreign Affairs) and Jim Killen (Defence) were [...] "involved in a row" [...] over the plan. The following month, a Cabinet submission stated that the UN proposal had a [...] "reasonable prospect" [...] of success, and Cabinet approved the commitment of an engineer force of 250 officers and men and a national headquarters and <b>support</b> <b>element</b> of 50 on 19 February. Horner noted that there was very little criticism of this decision in the press at the time, and the decision was accepted without question.|$|E

40|$|According to the medium, arts can be {{classified}} into the art of visual, the art of hearing, {{and the art of}} words. Those included in the art of visual are dance and fine art, in the art of hearing is music and in the art of words is poetry. This paper describes one of the art of the visual—dance, which use human body and its movement as a medium of expression. Fact shows that a dance performance exists due to the involvement of <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> such as visual disposition. Certain dances limit themselves to the <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> of costumes, make-up, property (tools) and musical instruments; others equip with stages, decorations, and lightings. Traditional dances—in particular—extensively equip themselves with <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> to show its characteristics. Thus, since dance requires the <b>supporting</b> <b>element</b> of visuals, it is reasonable to observe it as similar to the way we observe the object of fine art. The scope of observation for the <b>supporting</b> <b>elements</b> of dance performance may cover the whole visual events or just merely one of the scenes. Therefore, a contextual knowledge of both inside and outside can be fully grasped to form the background of the dance performance...|$|R
500|$|Cross was {{promoted}} to brigadier on 30 June 1996. He was appointed Director, Materiel Supply and Distribution (Army), a post which became Director, Materiel Support (Army) in 1997 {{as a result of}} re-organisation, based in Andover, Hampshire. At the end of 1997, he took command of the British National <b>Support</b> <b>Element</b> in the Balkans, responsible for supplying the British contingent of the NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR). At the same time, he commanded the Combat Service Support Group, later renamed 101 Logistic Brigade. He returned to the UK in April 1998, only to be told that he would be returning to the Balkans in January 1999 as part of the Kosovo Force (KFOR). In this role, he was responsible for the humanitarian effort {{in the aftermath of the}} Kosovo War, establishing and maintaining refugee camps in Macedonia and Albania. He was tasked with commanding multinational troops, as well as coordinating the humanitarian efforts of personnel from the British Department for International Development, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and multiple non-governmental organisations. Speaking about his service with KFOR, he later called it a [...] "challenging and demanding deployment" [...] and [...] "the first time that I have come face to face with a large-scale humanitarian crisis." [...] He went on to say that the most challenging part was the military working alongside large numbers of civilian agencies and that the Army needed to learn how to better work with such organisations—a need he said was [...] "widely recognised" [...] outside the military. In recognition of his service in the Balkans, Cross was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2000 New Year Honours List.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Support</b> <b>Element</b> is {{the most}} direct and lowest level way to access a mainframe. It {{circumvents}} even the Hardware Management Console and the operating system running on the mainframe. The HMC is a PC connected to the mainframe and emulates the <b>Support</b> <b>Element.</b> All preceding zSeries mainframes used {{a modified version of}} OS/2 with custom software to provide the interface. System z9's HMC no longer uses OS/2, but instead uses a modified version of Linux with an OS/2 lookalike interface to ease transition as well as a new interface. Unlike the previous HMC application on OS/2, the new HMC is web-based which means that even local access is done via a web browser. Remote HMC access is available, although only over an SSL encrypted HTTP connection. The web-based nature means that {{there is no longer a}} difference between local console access and remote access, which means a remote user potentially has full control if authorized, allowing more flexibility for locating systems within data centers. IBM refers to the new HMC as a [...] "closed platform" [...] which does not allow the user to install software or access the command line interface to increase security and stability. The HMC is also firewalled by default with a minimal number of open ports for remote access.|$|E
