The analysis is based on a general model of the user population’s traffic characteristics. The results show that by increasing bandwidth allocation prices, the service provider can encourage more users to choose SVC service, thereby increasing total revenue and reducing the provider’s bandwidth costs, but driving up the provider’s connection setup costs. The point at which the provider’s net income is maximized is strongly influenced by the relationship between the provider’s bandwidth costs and per-connection setup costs; smaller relative setup costs will motivate the service provider to encourage (through pricing parameters) more users to utilize SVC service.

40|$|The {{beginning}} of the 1990 s brought new technologies in the telecommunication networks. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) has been chosen as the transmission technology of broadband networks. The standardisation of ATM is practically finished today, the implementations are ready and the ATM equipment is largely introduced by users and service providers. At {{the end of the}} 1990 s the Internet Protocol (IP) became the fastest growing network layer protocol that is applicable over any data link layer. The convergence of these two technologies became reality at the {{beginning of}} the year 2000, but a couple of months later the telecommunication market entered the deepest recession ever seen. In the current marketplace the service providers must improve network management to reduce operation costs. ATM network service providers offered mainly permanent virtual circuit connections to customers in the last years, but recently there is an increasing interest to offer <b>switched</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> (SVC) connections to end users. The SVC is based on the use of signalling protocols. Our paper focuses on the performance of call processing in ATM networks. Based on a series of measurements on four types of ATM switches we have established some generalised conclusions, which are switch invariant features of the ATM signalling flows. These results have a wide generality among ATM switches and they can be used to model and design large ATM signalling networks. Our new model is validated against the measurement results on the 7 -node backbone of the TEN- 155 Pan-European ATM network.

If a mobile roams to a rerouting cell, its traffic path is rerouted to a PVC between the AS and rerouting cell. By using PVC's for handoff calls, we can guarantee fast and seamless handoff.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} concept, VLSI {{microarchitecture}} {{and implementation of}} a network on-chip (NoC) supporting a flexible communication media share methodology. The concept and methodology {{are based on a}} variable dynamic local identity tag (ID-tag) management technique, where different messages can be interleaved at flit-level on the same communication channel. Each message is multiplexed and allocated to a local ID slot on the shared channel. In order to implement the concept and methodology, a special packet format will be introduced, where additional two control bit fields, i. e. an ID-tag field and a flit-type field, are attached on every flit of the message in line with a data word. The reserved ID slot number, to which the message is allocated, is attributed in the ID-tag field. The flit-type field together with the ID-tag field is used to identify the messages and the type of every message flit, and to control the behavior of certain components in the NoC switch (NoC router) at runtime (during application execution time). The type of the flits is classified into a header used to open the ID-tag reservation, a databody, or a tail flit that is used to terminate the ID-tag reservation. When entering a new communication channel, the ID-tag of a message is updated. Each message is allocated to a new local ID slot and organized in such a way, that flits belonging to the same message will have the same ID-tag on every communication channel. Therefore, an ID management unit is integrated in a switch multiplexor component at every output port of the NoC router to organize the ID-tag reservation or the ID slot allocation procedure. In order to guarantee a correct routing path configuration at runtime, a routing engine component consisting of a routing state machine and a routing reservation table is implemented on each input port. The routing engine routes the interleaved different messages based on their ID-tag. The proposed concept and methodology have impacts on the implementation of advantageous and extensive features in the NoC router compared with the existing NoC concepts presented in the literature. The basic advantageous application of the proposed concept and methodology is the ability to implement a new wormhole switching method called wormhole flit-level cut-through switching method to overcome the head-of-line blocking problems commonly occur when using traditional wormhole switching method. The problem is solved by allowing the flits of the competing wormhole messages to be interleaved at flit level in the same communication link without using virtual channels. The proposed concept allows us to implement a new deadlock-free tree-based multicast routing methodology with static or adaptive routing algorithm, where the routing engines used to route the unicast and multicast messages are the same, resulting in a low-area overhead multicast routing engine. The thesis introduces also a new theory for deadlock-free multicast routing suitable for NoCs. The theory is formulated based on a new simple and smart mechanism to handle multicast contentions called hold-release tagging mechanism. The multicast deadlock configuration problem in the tree-based multicast routing is solved without the use of virtual channels. Beside (1) the new wormhole switching method and (2) the new deadlock-free multicast routing method mentioned before, the proposed concept allow us, (3) to develop a new adaptive routing selection strategy (contention- and bandwidth-aware adaptive routing selection strategy), (4) to develop a <b>switched</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> configuration method based on the ID-division multiple access technique for implementing a runtime connection-oriented guaranteed-bandwidth service, and (5) to combine the connectionless best-effort and the connection-oriented guaranteed-bandwidth services in a single NoC router prototype. This doctoral thesis introduces in general a NoC router prototype called XhiNoC (eXtendable Hierarchical Network-on Chip). The VLSI microarchitecture of the XhiNoC routers is flexible and extendable, in which the generic components of the NoC router can be simply replaced by extended components. If needed, a number of new signal paths is added. Hence, a new NoC router prototype with the aforementioned extensive services, such as adaptive routing service, multicast routing service and connection-oriented guaranteed-bandwidth service can be designed from the basic VLSI microarchitecture of the XHiNoC Router...|$|E

40|$|An {{integrated}} service internet running real-time {{and multimedia}} applications is rapidly becoming a reality. Meanwhile, ATM technology is {{appearing in the}} marketplace. It is an important problem to integrate ATM networks into this integrated service internet. One of the approaches, classical IP over ATM, is now widely deployed, effectively solving the problem of internetworking and interoperability. A key remaining issue is to provide quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees for internet traffic running through ATM subnets. This paper describes a priority scheme, named User Priority, for providing an IP integrated service with QoS over ATM <b>switched</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> (SVCs) to obtain better performance of packet delivery. The User Priority {{is defined as a}} three-bit field which uses a type of service (TOS) field in the IP datagram header. This yields eight different service classes with a value of 7 for the highest priority and 0 for the lowest priority. Class 6 and 7 services are for real-time traffic and have their own VCs. Packets with Classes 0 through 5 are sent an aggregate VC. This method is different from the IP over ATM scheme where only one VC is set up between two communicating IP hosts. Thus, packets can be treated differently according to their priorities such that they can enjoy the various QoS guarantees provided by ATM networks. It is backward-compatible with existing IP implementations. These newer options need only to be implemented on the end systems that {{want to take advantage of}} them...|$|R

40|$|Link {{failures}} are {{a common}} cause of service disruption in computer networks. When a link of a network fails, all communications which were using the failed link are tem-porarily interrupted. Techniques have been engineered to alleviate the consequences of hardware failure in a network by rerouting traffic from the failed link to other links. When performed by low communication layers, rerouting is fast but expensive as ad-ditional hardware is needed. On the other hand, {{it is possible to}} reroute traffic at higher layers using software mechanisms, but such solutions prove to be slow. More-over, most rerouting schemes are not optimized for multicasting applications such as teleconferencing where one sender can send data to several receivers.
