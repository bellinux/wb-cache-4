5000|$|The {{park has}} a large open lawn {{surrounded}} by ponderosa pine, western juniper, poplar, and locust trees that extend to the river’s edge. [...] The park also includes riparian habitat, sagebrush covered uplands, and canyon rimrocks. These areas are home to blackbirds, canyon wrens, American dipper, song sparrows, and finches. Other song birds pass through the area during {{the spring and fall}} migrations. Prairie falcons and golden eagles are also found in the Cline Falls area. As it flows by the park, the Deschutes River alternates between small rapids and calm pools. The rapids pass around a number of very large boulders. The calm sections create wetlands along the shore that attract a variety of wildlife. Canada geese and other water fowl are common in the wetlands along the river. [...] A number of small mammals including the Great Basin pocket mouse and <b>sagebrush</b> <b>voles</b> are found in the park as well.|$|R
50|$|Lagurus is a genus in the {{subfamily}} Arvicolinae (voles, lemmings, {{and related}} species). Together with the closely related Eolagurus, it forms the tribe Lagurini. Lagurus includes a single living species, the steppe lemming (Lagurus lagurus) of central Eurasia. The North American <b>sagebrush</b> <b>vole</b> (Lemmiscus curtatus) {{has also been}} included in Lagurus, but is likely not closely related. The earliest fossils of Lagurus, allocated to Lagurus arankae, appear in the Late Pliocene. Two other fossil species, Lagurus pannonicus and Lagurus transiens, {{are thought to be}} part of a lineage that led to the living steppe lemming.|$|E

40|$|To provide {{empirical}} evidence of species boundaries {{and the role}} of climatic change in affecting evolution, we documented evolution of the <b>sagebrush</b> <b>vole,</b> Lemmiscus curtatus, through hundreds of thousands of years by following populations from the middle Pleistocene to the present. We found that: (i) extant representatives of the species culminate a morphological transition that was initiated within an unusually and and warm interglacial period, perhaps related to the shift from glacial-interglacial cycles dominated by a 41 000 year periodicity to those dominated by a 100 000 year rhythm; and (ii) sympatry of extant and extinct morphotypes persisted for more than 800 000 years. This exceptionally detailed tracing of extinct populations into extant ones suggests that species such as the one we studied are real entities in space, that their boundaries become fuzzy (although potentially diagnosable) through time and that unusual climatic warming may initiate significant evolutionary change manifested at the morphological level...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRiparian {{areas are}} valued in arid regions for {{supporting}} wildlife diversity. We examined relationships between small mammal diversity and riparian areas and mechanisms facilitating higher small mammal diversity in riparian areas. Riparian areas were identifiable from uplands by higher plant cover and supported higher small mammal abundance. Small mammal abundance {{was related to}} plant cover and decreased away from riparian habitat. Riparian and upland habitats supported different species, contributing to higher gamma diversity via species turnover between habitats. Differences in plant δ 13 C between riparian and upland habitats were used to track assimilation of riparian resources by small mammals. Voles and shrews derived significant portions of their carbon from riparian vegetation. <b>Sagebrush</b> <b>vole</b> and woodrat hair was relatively low in δ 13 C, likely the result of assimilating forbs and annual grasses in upland habitat. Deer and harvest mice were abundant in riparian habitat but assimilated little riparian vegetation indicating that the riparian corridor provided resources other than food. In addition to food resources, plant cover likely provided protection from predators and a moderate microclimate. To our knowledge this is first use of δ 13 C to trace riparian resources into a vertebrate community and show δ 13 C as a good proxy for riparian vegetation assimilation...|$|E

Fire is an important disturbance mechanism in big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) communities, yet {{little is known about}} wildlife population dynamics during post-fire habitat succession. I estimated the abundance of small mammals and birds in relation to fire history in mountain big sagebrush (A. t. spp. vaseyana) communities on the Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge in the northwestern Great Basin, USA. I employed a chronosequence approach that took advantage of multiple wildfires that had occurred in similar plant communities between 7 to 20 years prior to sampling. Belding’s ground squirrel (Spermophilus beldingii) were approximately 10 times as abundant in burned areas relative to adjacent unburned habitat regardless of the number of years since a burn occurred. Deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) was more abundant on more recently burned sites, but not at sites closer to full vegetation recovery. Great basin pocket mouse (Perognathus parvus), <b>sagebrush</b> <b>vole</b> (Lemmiscus curtatus), and least chipmunk (Tamius minimus) abundance did not vary as a function of fire history, but some variance was explained by habitat features such as rocky areas and the canopy characteristics of sagebrush. Bird diversity was higher in unburned habitats irrespective of the number of years of recovery out to 20 years. Nine of the 12 most widely occurring species of birds in the study have population densities influenced by fire or post-fire habitat succession to at least 13 to 20 years following a burn. Sage Sparrow (Amphispiza belli), Black-throated Sparrow (Amphispiza bilineata), and Spotted Towhee (Pipilo maculatus) occurred at relatively low densities and were nearly {{restricted to}} unburned habitats. Green-tailed Towhee (Pipilo Chlorurus), Gray Flycatcher (Empidonax wrightii), American Robin (Turdus migratorius), and Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothus ater) occurred at lower densities in burned areas than adjacent unburned areas although the relationship was not strong for the latter two species. The magnitude of the difference in density between burned and unburned sites within a landscape diminished with the number of years of vegetation recovery for Green-tailed Towhee. Brewer’s Sparrow (Spizella brewerii) occurred at lower densities relative to adjacent habitat in the most recent burn, but occurred at higher densities after 20 years of habitat succession, suggesting a positive response with a multiple decade lag period. Horned Lark (Eremophila alpestris) and Vesper Sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus) respond positively to fire, but densities were similar to unburned areas after 20 years of habitat succession.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 This paper lists, {{and gives}} {{individual}} accounts of, those Oregon mammals {{that at some}} time have {{been referred to as}} being of a status other than common. Although rare and endangered wildlife species were listed on a national level in the United States, the large areas of land included in the range of some species often allow population changes in local areas to go undetected. Several authorities have recognized the need for local and regional studies to determine the status of wildlife species. No comprehensive study of the mammals of Oregon has been conducted since 1936. I reviewed the available literature concerning Oregon mammals and compiled a working list of species. All species that were referred to as "uncommon, rare, or scarce" were included for additional study. Specimens deposited in museum and personal collections were examined and the date and location of collection of specimens of each species under investigation were recorded. Collection sites of specimens were depicted on maps. Mammalogists, game biologists, naturalists, trappers, and outdoorsmen having knowledge of Oregon mammals were interviewed, and asked to comment on the current distribution and abundance of the species with which they were familiar. Information from all sources was used to develop criteria for placing each species into one of the following categories: recently extirpated, endangered, rare, status undetermined, or not presently rare or endangered. Mammals were classified as follows: Mammals recently extirpated from Oregon; grizzly bear (Ursus arctos), wolf (Canis lupus), bison (Bison bison). Endangered mammals in Oregon; Richardson ground squirrel (Spermophilus richardsoni), kit fox (Vulpes macrotis), sea otter (Enhydra lutris), wolverine (Gulo luscus), lynx (Lynx canadensis), Columbian white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus leucurus). Rare mammals in Oregon; Maiheur shrew (Sorex preblei), Merriam shrew (Sorex merriami), Ashland shrew (Sorex trigonirostris), Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis), white-footed vole (Arborimus (Phenacomys) albipes), ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), fisher (Martes pennanti), northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Mammals of undetermined status in Oregon; fringed myotis (Myotis thysanodes), western pipistrelle (Pipistrellus hesperus), Washington ground squirrel (Spermophilus washingtoni), little pocket mouse (Perognathus longimembris). Mammals evaluated but not presently rare or endangered in Oregon; hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), white-tailed hare (Lepus townsendii), pigmy rabbit (Sylvilagus idahoensis), antelope ground squirrel (Ammospermophilus leucurus), Bottae pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae), dark kangaroo mouse (Microdipodops megacephalus), Heerman kangaroo rat (Dipodomys heermanni), heather vole (Phenacomys intermedius), red tree mouse (Arborimus (Phenacomys) longicaudus), California meadow mouse (Microtus californicus), <b>sagebrush</b> <b>vole</b> (Lagurus curtatus), marten (Martes americana), badger (Taxidea taxus), river otter (Lutra canadensis), northern sea lion (Eumetopias jubata), California sea lion (Zalophus californicus), harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), mountain lion (Felis concolor), Idaho white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus ochrourus). The necessary use of imprecise terms such as "very uncommon" in defining categories of classification injected a degree of subjectivity into the proposed classification. However, it is believed that this study consolidated existing knowledge, and that it will provide a basis for future, more detailed studies which may reveal basic ecological requirements of rare and endangered forms of mammals in Oregon...|$|E
