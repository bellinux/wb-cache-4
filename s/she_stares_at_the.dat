25|$|As {{the month}} {{comes to an}} end, with the sun due to rise, the vampires start to burn down the town to destroy {{evidence}} of their presence, and prevent any survivors from telling the world what happened. Realizing Stella is trapped and that he cannot beat the vampires in his current state, Eben turns himself into a vampire by injecting himself with Billy's infected blood. He confronts Marlow, and they get into a vicious fight, before Marlow is finally killed by having a hole punched through his head, causing the remaining vampires to flee. Knowing he will die soon, Eben and Stella go off to watch the sunrise together, sharing one last kiss. As the sun comes up, Eben's body burns to ash in Stella's arms, while <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky, {{coming to grips with}} what has happened.|$|E
500|$|She {{then walks}} past several people, dances with several {{men and women}} in white and black suits and dresses, as the second chorus begins. Beyoncé and the dancers perform a dance routine together, and soon she meets a man, who dances with her. A {{particular}} scene shows all the dancers crouch down to the floor, and follow Beyoncé as she walks, before she blows them back. [...] The bridge starts, and the video moves to Beyoncé in a red room, where she and her dancers dance in short skirts, fishnets and black sparkling dresses. The group is later dance in the red and white rooms together. Leading into the final chorus, Beyoncé dances back in the room with the dancers, while Rowland, Williams and her sister sit on a black couch.

2500|$|Utamaro {{depicts the}} courtesan Hanaōgi of the Ōgiya (...) as she composes a letter, writing brush held {{to her cheek}} as <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> paper deep in thought. [...] The Ōgiya was a large, {{long-established}} shop in Yoshiwara, and Hanaōgi built her reputation in the 1780s for her beauty and her skills in singing, playing the koto, the tea ceremony, the Chinese classics, and incense.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mud-browned chilly water, the {{floating}} gray reeds.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{paper in}} her hand. Then {{she looked away}} into the fire.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Baxters {{like one}} in a dream, and then gave a sudden cry of alarm.|$|R
6000|$|Ah, ah, Cytherea! Adonis is dead, [...] Fair Adonis is dead--Echo answers, Adonis: [...] Who weeps not for Cypris, when bowing {{her head}} [...] <b>She</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wound where it gapes and astonies? [...] --When, ah, ah!--she saw how the blood ran away [...] And empurpled the thigh, and, with wild hands flung out, [...] Said with sobs: [...] "Stay, Adonis! unhappy one, stay, [...] Let me feel thee once more, let me ring thee about [...] With the clasp of my arms, and press kiss into kiss! [...] Wait a little, Adonis, and kiss me again, [...] For the last time, beloved,--and {{but so much}} of this [...] That the kiss may learn life from the warmth of the strain! [...] --Till thy breath shall exude from thy soul to my mouth, [...] To my heart, and, the love-charm I once more {{receiving}} [...] May drink thy love in it and keep of a truth [...] That one kiss in the place of Adonis the living. [...] Thou fliest me, mournful one, fliest me far, [...] My Adonis, and seekest the Acheron portal,-- [...] To Hell's cruel King goest down with a scar, [...] While I weep and live on like a wretched immortal, [...] And follow no step! O Persephoné, take him, [...] My husband!--thou'rt better and brighter than I, [...] So all beauty flows down to thee: I cannot make him [...] Look up at my grief; there's despair in my cry, [...] Since I wail for Adonis who died to me--died to me-- [...] Then, I fear thee!--Art thou dead, my Adored? [...] Passion ends like a dream in the sleep that's denied to me, [...] Cypris is widowed, the Loves seek their lord [...] All the house through in vain. Charm of cestus has ceased [...] With thy clasp! O too bold in the hunt past preventing, [...] Ay, mad, thou so fair, to have strife with a beast!" [...] Thus the goddess wailed on--and the Loves are lamenting.|$|E
5000|$|Eventually, Linda {{visits the}} site of the {{accident}}. <b>She</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Mile 220" [...] sign, which is where Sheriff Reilly told her the accident took place. Images of her family flash before her eyes as Linda tries to decide what to do.|$|E

60|$|She {{handed over}} her bank-book with the money. Receiving <b>the</b> former back, <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mysterious figures with rapt attention.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps you {{can imagine}} how startled Jane Gladys was, and how <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clown who had just leaped out of the book.|$|R
60|$|He noticed Joan's white, tense face, and {{the wide}} eyes with which <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wreck {{of what had been}} a man the minute before.|$|R
50|$|Lorraine {{takes him}} to an old mine, and shows him a dark hole {{that leads to a}} caved in lower shaft. She and Hex journey down, and it is {{revealed}} that Lorraine has murdered at least fifteen men. Grabbing a knife, Lorraine tries once more to kill Hex, who punches her and secures Red's body. Lorraine comes to just as Hex reaches the top and kicks down the rope trapping her there. Lorraine first pleads that they can be partners, then tells Hex he can't leave her. Hex says she has plenty of companions whom she knows, then departs. Lorraine trembles as <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dead bodies, the only lamp in the shaft slowly going out, leaving her trapped in the dark.|$|E

60|$|Elsa's jaw fell. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> traitor {{like one}} paralysed, while Adrian, seizing {{the back of}} a chair, rested upon it, and rocked his body to and fro.|$|R
60|$|He stopped. The {{effect of}} his words on the elderly lady was remarkable. Her face seemed to turn to stone and become all sharp points. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl.|$|R
60|$|It was Mrs. Paston Benedek {{who opened}} it. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first sheet {{for a moment}} with eyes which were almost dilated. Then she looked around. Her voice sounded unnatural.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} favourably by the eminent critic Pauline Kael in her collection Hooked. [...] "This film has wonderful uninsistent images. It's poverty-row film making, {{and often the}} shots don't match. But it's the kind of movie in which you rather enjoy the shots' not matching. It draws you into the moviemaking process; the informality is likable. After little Vicky has watched her father flying around the tank (he loves it, he's completely happy), she too, becomes obsessed, and there's a shot of her, her face as determined as his, as she rides her tricycle along the Wall, trying to climb it. She wakes up one night hearing the crackling sound of burning wood; she rushes {{out the front door}} and sees her parents and her Uncle Arthur watching a fire, and <b>she</b> <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spectacle without a sound, the flames lighting her awed, startled face. For an instant, with her hair streaming back from her head, she's the soul of Ireland, the way Sara Allgood was when she played in Juno and the Paycock." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> harsh {{bitterness}} of his voice. She {{was about to}} speak when the door opened, and Malcom ushered in Aunt Plessington and Uncle Hubert. Husband and wife hung for a moment, and then realized their talk was at an end....|$|R
6000|$|Lucy stifled a gasp of dismay. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wretched man. Had he forgotten? He {{thought that}} the house of his fathers was his still; and all that had parted him from it was gone from his memory. How could she tell him? ...|$|R
60|$|She {{surveyed}} the cat, but {{the cat was}} quite calm. Then she looked very, very hard at her lamp. It was a patent safety lamp, and had always behaved very well. Then <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window, but the curtains were drawn and everything was in order.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Clifford ceased speaking, {{and filled}} his pipe, while Meyer helped himself to squareface in an absent manner. As for Benita, <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> quaint old coin, {{which had a}} hole in it, {{wondering}} with what scenes of terror and of bloodshed it had been connected.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{that you}} are really clear of it, I am going for them," [...] she said {{presently}} when the wiping process was finished. [...] "I have only restrained myself for your sake," [...] and leaning {{back in her chair}} <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ceiling, lost in meditation.|$|R
60|$|But Cicely did not stir; <b>she</b> only <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wretched {{creature}} <b>at</b> her feet.|$|R
6000|$|Then he drew to {{the corner}} of the room and {{consulted}} with Sarceda and the other torturers, leaving Marina face to face with Guatemoc and with me. For a while <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> prince as though in horror, then a strange light came into her beautiful eyes, and she spoke to him in a low voice, saying in the Aztec tongue: ...|$|R
60|$|So {{he shrugged}} his shoulders, and they limped forward up the roofless nave and through <b>the</b> door. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> plain stone altar, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eastern window, of which part {{was filled with}} ancient {{coloured}} glass and part with cheap glazed panes; <b>at</b> <b>the</b> oak choir benches, mouldy and broken; <b>at</b> <b>the</b> few wall-slabs and decaying monuments, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> roof still strong and massive.|$|R
60|$|The girls laughed, and Josie blushed as <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tall man, {{conscious}} {{that she had}} leaped before she looked. They made a pretty contrast, these two young cousins--one as fair as a lily, the other a little wild rose. And Dan gave a nod of satisfaction as he surveyed them; for he had seen many bonny girls in his travels, and was glad that these old friends were blooming so beautifully.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was past}} midnight. Deep {{darkness}} and heavy silence lay upon Thebes, {{broken only by}} dogs howling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stars and the occasional challenge of soldiers on the walls. Side by side in their golden bed the wearied Pharaoh and his queen slept heavily. Presently Ahura woke. She started up in <b>the</b> bed; <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> darkness about her with frightened eyes; she stretched out her hand and clasping Pharaoh by the arm, whispered in a thrilling voice, ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> picture interestedly, forgetting him, {{pinching}} {{her chin}} thoughtfully, while she murmured: [...] "They're rather nice. Rather good. Rather good." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him, <b>the</b> joy of festival {{drained from}} her face. [...] "Do I bother {{you when we}} go on vacations? Don't I add {{anything}} to your fun?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{stunning}} {{surprise of}} this reply nailed the hag's {{feet to the}} floor where she stood, and almost took her breath. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Prince in stupid amazement, which so amused her ruffianly son, that he burst into a roar of laughter. But the effect upon Tom Canty's mother and sisters was different. Their dread of bodily injury gave way at once to distress of a different sort. They ran forward with woe and dismay in their faces, exclaiming-- ...|$|R
60|$|When {{she lay in}} bed, <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{light of}} the street-lamp on the wall. She was {{thinking}} busily: but heaven knows what she was thinking. She had sharpened {{the edge of her}} temper. She was waiting till tomorrow. She was waiting till she saw Albert Witham. She wanted to finish off with him. She was keen to cut clean through any correspondence with him. <b>She</b> <b>stared</b> for many hours <b>at</b> <b>the</b> light of the street-lamp, and there was a narrowed look in her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|She {{continued}} {{to shake her}} head and mutter [...] "Impossible" [...] for some time, while <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> candle as if she expected that it would solve the mystery. Then {{she got up and}} examined the bedclothes, and found that {{a good deal of the}} rhubarb had been spilt on the sheets, and that a good deal more of it had been spilt on Boone's chin and chest; after which her aspect changed considerably, as, setting down the candle, she resumed her seat and said-- ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> large {{poster of}} Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, {{scribbled}} on the jotter sixteens and capital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She's not nicelooking, is she? The way she's holding up her {{bit of a}} skirt. Wonder will that fellow be <b>at</b> <b>the</b> band tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle's. They kick out grand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he won't keep me here till seven.|$|R
6000|$|When the {{arithmetic}} came, the little teacher {{was surprised to}} find her scholar quicker in some things than herself, for Phebe had worked away <b>at</b> <b>the</b> columns in the butcher's and baker's books till she could add so quickly and correctly that Rose was amazed, and felt that in this branch the pupil would soon excel the teacher if she kept on <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same pace. Her praise cheered Phebe immensely, and they went bravely on, both getting so interested that time flew unheeded till Aunt Plenty appeared, exclaiming, as <b>she</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> two heads bent over one slate, ...|$|R
