5|$|After the Athens Olympics, Thorpe took a {{year away}} from swimming, {{scheduling}} a return for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. However, {{he was forced to}} withdraw due to illness. <b>Subsequent</b> <b>training</b> camps were interrupted, and he announced his retirement in November 2006, citing waning motivation. From early 2011, there was speculation about Thorpe's return to swimming, fuelled by people claiming to have seen him training. The speculations were substantiated when Thorpe spoke at a February 2011 press conference of his return to swimming after four years away, with the aim of competing in the 2012 London Olympic Games. Thorpe competed at Australia's Olympic Trials in 2012, but failed to make the team. It was subsequently announced that he was targeting qualification for the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona and later the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow but was forced to abandon his plans due to a shoulder injury. In 2014, he was presented with a Doctor of Letters from Macquarie University in recognition of his contribution for the sport, philanthropy and Indigenous rights.|$|E

During {{the start of the}} <b>subsequent</b> <b>training</b> camp, Brown was in England filming scenes for The Dirty Dozen due to {{production}} delays, and on July 14, Brown announced his retirement from football to concentrate on his acting career. The Browns were able to blunt the effect of Brown's departure with the emergence of third-year running back Leroy Kelly, who rushed for more than 1,000 yards in each of the next three seasons, leading the league during the latter two years.|$|E

[...] Continuing to play for Krefeld, he notched 24 points in 46 games. Despite impressing with his skating and offensive skills at the Sharks' 2002 training camp, he was returned to Krefeld {{for the second straight}} year. After notching a German career-high 27 points in 48 games in 2002–03, Ehrhoff helped Krefeld win a German championship in his final season with the club. [...] He recorded nine points in the post-season.|$|E
30|$|The {{simulations}} {{carried out}} in our study only considered the SOS for one train based on the train’s passenger demand matrix. On a continuous basis, the SOSs for <b>subsequent</b> <b>trains</b> may be determinate or stochastic depending on the passenger demands of the trains, which consist of the accumulated, abandoned passengers skipped by the upstream train, even when a <b>subsequent</b> <b>train</b> does not adopt the SOS. However, whatever strategies the downstream trains adopt {{is up to the}} operation authorities and empirical passenger situations, and we are able to generalize the operation strategies of all trains using our proposed estimation method.|$|R

2500|$|He {{returned}} to Boulder in November 1945 to study Aeronautical Engineering at the University of Colorado at Boulder. While at Colorado he joined Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity. At {{the end of}} his senior year, he missed the final examination in heat transfer, leaving him one requirement short of a degree. After his Mercury flight, the university granted him a Bachelor of Science degree on grounds that, [...] "His <b>subsequent</b> <b>training</b> as an Astronaut has more than made up for the deficiency in the subject of heat transfer." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1920 {{the army}} of Norway was a {{national}} militia. Service was universal and compulsory, liability commencing {{at the age of}} 18 and continuing till the age of 56. The men were called out at 21, and for the first 12 years belonged to the line then for 12 years to the landvarn. Afterwards they passed into the landatorm, in which they remained until they attained the age of 55 years. The initial training was carried out in recruits' schools it lasted for 48 days in the infantry and garrison artillery, 62 in the mountain batteries, 72 in the engineers, 92 in the field artillery, and 102 in the cavalry. As soon as their courses were finished the men were transferred to the units to which they would permanently belong, and with them went through a further training of 30 days. <b>Subsequent</b> <b>training</b> consisted of 80 days in the second, third and seventh years of service.|$|E
2500|$|During the War of Austrian Succession, in 1741 as a {{lieutenant}} general he commanded the city Kolberg. As {{a participant in}} the Battle of Mollwitz, his infantry regiment not only held its line despite the flight of the Prussian cavalry, but subsequently attacked the Austrian line with such ferocity that he and his soldiers received special mention in Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin's report. He was wounded in the fighting. The regiment's actions here reflected the iron training imposed by the prince of Anhalt Dessau on his subordinates, and their <b>subsequent</b> <b>training</b> of their own regiments. [...] In addition, the Prussian infantry benefited not only from the discipline of drill but also the latest in military technology; unlike their Austrian counterparts, they had iron ramrods which allowed them to fire faster and more accurately. After the battle, he was made a Knight of the Order of the Black Eagle on 15 April 1741, and later awarded the Order Pour le Mérite. During the Silesian Wars, in 1744 he acquired as war booty the gold-plated carriage originally belonging to Jan Sobieski; Kleist gave the carriage to his local church.|$|E

5000|$|Initially, all of {{the trains}} were Russian built. They first arrived in Warsaw in 1990 as a [...] "gift" [...] from the USSR, five {{years prior to the}} Metro's opening, from Metrovagonmash plant in Mytishchi (near Moscow) (model 81-717.3/714.3 - 10 carriages). <b>Subsequent</b> <b>trains</b> arrived from Saint Petersburg's Yegorov Plant in 1994 (81-572/573 - 32 carriages) and {{additional}} 18 81-572.1/573.1 carriages in 1997.|$|R
2500|$|By Saturday, the {{infection}} had died down, and she flew to Kona. On Sunday Wellington published a blog post {{in which she}} referred to Sun Tzu's book The Art of War and elaborated on how war strategy {{could be applied to}} triathlon, saying that she hadn't lost her fight because of her injuries and quoting Bella Bayliss's dictum that [...] "It's not a race, it's war." [...] The flight had caused her leg to swell up again, but she was still able to do some bike and run training. On Monday she tried a four-kilometre swim, her first hard swim since the crash; this produced pain in her pectoral muscle, which worsened over <b>subsequent</b> <b>training</b> sessions. On Tuesday she tried another swim session: after 1km she had to stop, and again had to be lifted out of the pool by Lowe. She later wote, [...] "I was 'crying into my goggles', and described the pain as 'unbearable'", adding, [...] "I was convinced I'd broken my rib. Every breath hurt and I couldn't move my arm properly." [...] The previous day Mike Leahy had begun treating Wellington using his Active Release Therapy (ART); he instructed her {{to go to the hospital}} for tests, not wanting to continue ART treatment if the problem was a fracture. The hospital's first concern, from the swollen state of her leg, was that she might have a pulmonary embolism. Six hours of tests showed that she had no fractures, nor any embolism, but that she did have damaged pectoral and intercostal muscles; the badly infected state of her leg was obvious from the appalling smell when the bandages were removed.|$|E
2500|$|Pittsburgh {{defensive}} end Hugh Green {{was a surprise}} selection, as the Buccaneers were considered to need help in the secondary, and were expected to pick either USC safety Ronnie Lott or UCLA safety Kenny Easley (who had already been taken by the Seattle Seahawks {{by the time of}} Tampa Bay's selection). Green's Pittsburgh team produced eight NFL starters, believed to be the most by far from any single college team. By contrast, the Georgia team that finished ahead of them in the national championship race produced only two NFL players, neither of them a starter. Personnel director Ken Herock described Green as [...] "dominating...a heavy hitter...an impact player" [...] and said that there was no choice but to draft him. Scouting services described him as a 220-lb linebacker with the lateral movement of a 180-lb cornerback. It was doubly surprising that, considering their fondness for ex-USC players, the Buccaneers would pass over Lott to select a player at a position at which they already were so deeply stocked with talent. However, the staff did not deliberate long before calling his name, and soon felt him worthy of Rookie of the Year honors. With no premier defensive backs available in the second round, and with running back having been identified by the coaching staff as a problem area of the team, they selected Missouri running back James Wilder. Wilder's selection and <b>subsequent</b> <b>training</b> camp performance made starting fullback Johnny Davis expendable, and he was traded to San Francisco for James Owens. With their middle-round picks traded away, West Texas A cornerback John Holt became the Buccaneers' last selection of {{the first day of the}} draft. When McKay saw cornerbacks Holt and Johnny Ray Smith return punts, he immediately cut original Buccaneer Danny Reece, who had handled nearly every punt return in the team's first five years. Reece, who had set a league record by calling for fair catches only twice in the previous two seasons, had fallen out of favor due to several fumbles during the previous season, and never had the speed expected of a return man. Smith did make the team, but was immediately placed on injured reserve. Eighth-round pick Denver Johnson left camp unexpectedly shortly before the first preseason game, despite strong prospects of making the squad. It was later revealed that he had been accepted to law school, and chose that over a football career.|$|E
