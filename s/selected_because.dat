5|$|From the 24th Infantry Division, one {{battalion}} {{was assigned}} to be airlifted into Korea via C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft and move quickly to block advancing North Korean forces while {{the remainder of the}} division could be transported to South Korea on ships. The 21st Infantry Regiment was determined to be the most combat-ready of the 24th Infantry Division's three regiments, and the 21st Infantry's 1st Battalion was <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles B. Smith, was the most experienced, having commanded a battalion at the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II. On July 5, Task Force Smith engaged North Korean forces at the Battle of Osan, delaying over 5,000 North Korean infantry for seven hours before being routed and forced back.|$|E
5|$|Ouw Peh Tjoa was {{directed}} and produced by The Teng Chun for his company, Cino Motion Pictures. Since releasing Sam Pek Eng Tay in 1931, {{based on the}} legend of the Butterfly Lovers, The Teng Chun had released a series of films based on Chinese legends and folktales, including Pat Bie To (Eight Beautiful Women; 1932) and Pat Kiam Hiap (Eight Swordsmen; 1933). These stories were <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> the peranakan Chinese in the Indies were unable to understand Mandarin and Cantonese imports from China, but wanted to see films based on Chinese mythology. Overall, The Teng Chun's films emphasised the martial art silat and were generally profitable, allowing him to dominate the industry.|$|E
5|$|Palahniuk's {{novel was}} optioned by 20th Century Fox {{producer}} Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls {{to write the}} film adaptation. Fincher {{was one of four}} directors the producers considered, and was <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> of his enthusiasm for the film. Fincher developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. The director and the cast compared the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967). They said its theme was the conflict between a generation of young people and the value system of advertising. The director copied the homoerotic overtones from Palahniuk's novel to make audiences uncomfortable and keep them from anticipating the twist ending.|$|E

5|$|The opening scene, set at {{the closing}} {{ceremony}} of the 1925 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium, was filmed on location at Elland Road, home of Leeds United, and Odsal Stadium, home of Bradford RLFC.

The crew had access to the stadium only at 10pm, after a football game. They filled the terraces with inflatable dummies and over 250 extras dressed in period costumes. Live actors were interspersed to give the impression of a crowd. Additional people, as well as more ranks of soldiers on the pitch, were added in post-production with visual effects.|$|E

5|$|With {{the tender}} relaunched in 2007 as the F-X2 competition, the Brazilian Defence Ministry looked to {{purchase}} at least 36 aircraft– {{with a potential}} for 84 additional aircraft– to replace the country's A-1Ms, F-5BRs, and Mirage IIIs. Among the participants were the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-16BR, JAS Gripen NG, Dassault Rafale, Eurofighter Typhoon and the modernized Su-35. Although the Brazilian government eliminated the Su-35 in 2008, Rosoboronexport subsequently offered to sell the country 120 aircraft with full technology transfer, as well as participation in the PAK FA programme. In December 2013, the Gripen NG light fighter was <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> of its low cost and the transfer of technology to the Brazilian industry.|$|E

5|$|Forests {{were special}} areas {{of land in}} medieval England, owned by the Crown and subject to forest law. They were often <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> of their natural resources, and were {{expected}} to provide the Crown with a flow of money or raw materials. In 1195, the Forest of Dartmoor extended across all of Devon, but in 1204 John curtailed {{the extent of the}} royal forest, removing much of Devon from Forest Law and leaving the area known in the modern period as Dartmoor. This reduced forest was still subject to the Forest Laws, involving a specialised group of legal officials who met at Lydford Castle to impose fines and other punishments. Probably both Lydford Castle and the forest was given to the Sheriff of Devon, William Brewer, in 1216. The arrangement changed under Henry III, when the estates were given to Richard, the Earl of Cornwall in 1239. Legally, this meant that the Forest of Dartmoor was converted to a chase, although the Earls of Cornwall continued to hold law courts at Lydford Castle, enforcing chase laws that closely resembled the former Forest Laws.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the Engineering and Water Supply Department chose an {{area at the}} top of the park, {{adjacent}} to Lower North East Road, to build a water treatment works. Based partly on seismic refraction traverses, a ridge underlain by dolomite and quartzite was deemed to be stable enough for construction. The site was also <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> of its hydraulic advantages; all other sites would have required the construction of a major pumping station. The exact placement of the site was made so that it could not be seen from the metropolitan area. It has a design flow of 313megalitres (ML) per day with a maximum capacity of 344ML. The plant was commissioned in 1980 and uses filtration and sedimentation techniques to clean water from the Mannum to Adelaide pipeline. It was the second plant in Adelaide, after the opening of the Hope Valley plant in 1977. Most of the water is piped directly from the River Murray, but some is sourced from Millbrook Reservoir.|$|E

5|$|Kenyatta's {{academic}} progress was unremarkable, and in July 1912 {{he became an}} apprentice to the carpenter at the mission. At Easter 1912, he professed his dedication to Christianity and began undergoing catechism. In 1913, he underwent the Kikuyu circumcision ritual; the missionaries generally disapproved of this custom, {{but it was an}} important aspect of Kikuyu tradition, allowing Kenyatta to be recognised as an adult. Asked to take a Christian name, he chose both John and Peter after the eponymous Apostles in the New Testament. The missionaries however insisted that he select only one, and so he chose Johnstone, the -stone being <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> it was a Biblical reference to Peter. Accordingly, he was baptised as Johnstone Kamau in August 1914. After his baptism, Kenyatta moved out of the mission dormitory and lived with friends. Having completed his apprenticeship to a carpenter, Kenyatta requested that the mission allow him to be an apprentice stonemason, but they refused. Kenyatta then requested that he be recommended for employment, but the head missionary refused because of an allegation of minor dishonesty.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his life, Rakoto Frah was commemorated by fellow artists and by the {{government}} of Madagascar, which issued him numerous awards and commendations throughout his career. The design for the 1,000Malagasy franc (200ariary) banknote first printed by the Central Bank in 1983 depicted Rakoto Frah dressed in a traditional straw hat and lamba and playing the sodina. He is the only artist to have been featured on a Malagasy banknote. According to a representative of the Central Bank, the artist was <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> he was the most representative of the Malagasy identity. After the Rakoto Frah banknote design was discontinued in the 1990s it became a rare collector's item valued in 2011 at over 100,000ariary, more than 500 times its face value. The artist was also invited by international filmmakers to feature in two French films: the Madagascar documentary L'Ile Rouge released in 1992 by French director Jean-Michel Carré, and an eponymous documentary about the artist himself, produced by director Camille Marchand in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The ROK 1st Infantry Division, with 7,500 men {{had held}} the line around the Bowling Alley since August 12. The Bowling Alley area was <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> of its {{advantageous}} high ground which provided natural barriers to funnel North Korean troops into smaller fronts where South Korean defenses could attack them from the high ground in concealed positions. In the meantime, the KPA 3rd, 13th, and 15th Divisions were advancing south and preparing to close on Taegu. The KPA 13th Division converged on the Tabu-dong corridor and a vicious melee ensued between the North and South Korean troops, with ROK 1st Division's 11th, 12th, and 13th regiments committed against the KPA 13th Division's 19th, 21st and 23rd regiments. The fight became a battle of attrition. As the two sides closed on one another, the battle took a brutal turn by August 15 as supplies ran low and units were locked in close quarters combat with little ammunition for the weapons. Fighting across the entire front became hand-to-hand combat and grenade fights at close range. The two divisions were so evenly matched that neither could make any appreciable gains for days of fighting and huge numbers of casualties.|$|E

5|$|The first {{trading post}} {{at the site of}} the Port of Split was Aspalathos, {{established}} by Greek settlers from the island of Vis in the 4th century BC. Position of the trading post was <b>selected</b> <b>because</b> of its location in a natural harbor and its proximity to numerous Adriatic Sea islands and extensive hinterland populated by Illyrians, most notably in Salona. The area subsequently became a part of the Roman Empire, and after its Decline of the Roman Empire, the coast was brought under rule of the Byzantine Empire, until the area was absorbed into the Kingdom of Croatia in the beginning of the 10th century. In 1102, Croatia and Kingdom of Hungary were joined in a personal union. By the 12th century, Split had developed trading routes with its hinterland and maritime trade throughout the Adriatic Sea and the Mediterranean. The Republic of Venice of gained full control of Dalmatia and the city of Split by 1428. In the 16th century, Split was the central maritime trade outlet of the Balkans, where goods were transported from the Ottoman Empire, India and Persia to the Venetian Republic and vice versa. After the fall of Venice, Split was briefly ruled by the Habsburg Monarchy and Austrian Empire between 1797 and 1806, and the First French Empire until 1813 when Austrian rule was restored. In that period, trade routes shifted to other Adriatic ports, especially the Port of Rijeka, causing a downturn in the city's economy.|$|E
