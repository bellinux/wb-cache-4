It was still very hot, but the roads beyond Rouen were sandy and light; the lanes were quite <b>stoneless</b> and shaded by tall trees; the Normandy mare settled down along them to an easy amble. She had not the spirit of Belle Amie but she made up in stolidity what she had lacked in swiftness. Gaston's first impatience at the slowness of her gait soon yielded to content, for she needed no checking, and urging being useless--since she could go no faster--the rider was soon able to let his mind rest and even to sink into semi-somnolence, trusting himself to the horse entirely.|$|E

6000|$|Marching in this order, {{which was}} {{to serve as a}} model, we {{travelled}} due south along the coast, over a hard, <b>stoneless,</b> and alluvial plain, here dry, there muddy (where the tide reaches), across boggy creeks, broad water-courses, and warty flats of black mould powdered with nitrous salt, and bristling with the salsolaceous vegetation familiar to the Arab voyager. Such is the general formation of the plain between the mountains and the sea, whose breadth, in a direct line, may measure from forty-five to forty-eight miles. Near the first zone of hills, or sub-Ghauts, it produces a thicker vegetation; thorns and acacias of different kinds appear in clumps; and ground broken with ridges and ravines announces the junction.

My arms were peeled even in the month of December; and my companions, panting with the heat, like the Atlantes of Herodotus, poured forth reproaches upon the rising sun. The townspeople, when forced to hurry across it in the hotter season, cover themselves during the day with Tobes wetted every half hour in sea water; yet they are sometimes killed by the fatal thirst which the Simum engenders. Even the Bedouins are now longing for rain; a few weeks' drought destroys half their herds.|$|E
60|$|In {{the route}} I had taken, I {{had crossed the}} eastern {{extremity}} alone of the range, commencing with a very gradual ascent, over the alluvial plains {{of the west bank}} of the Hoogly, then over laterite, succeeded by sandstone of the Indian coal era, which is succeeded by the granite table-land, properly so called. A little beyond the coal fields, the table-land reaches an average height of 1130 feet, which is continued for upwards of 100 miles, to the Dunwah pass. Here the descent is sudden to plains, which, continuous with those of the Ganges, run up the Soane till beyond Rotasghur. Except for the occasional ridges of metamorphic rocks mentioned above, and some hills of intruded greenstone, the lower plain is <b>stoneless,</b> its subjacent rocks being covered with a thicker stratum of the same alluvium which is thinly spread over the higher table-land above. This range is of great interest from its being the source of many important rivers,* [The chief rivers from this, the great watershed of western Bengal, flow north-west and south-east; a few comparatively insignificant streams running north to the Ganges. Amongst the former are the Rheru, the Kunner, and the Coyle, which contribute to the Soane; amongst the latter, the Dammooda, Adji, and Barakah, flow into the Hoogly, and the Subunrika, Braminee, and Mahanuddee into the Bay of Bengal.] and of all those which water the country between the Soane, Hoogly, and Ganges, as well as from its deflecting the course of the latter river, which washes its base at Rajmahal, and forcing it to take a sinuous course to the sea. In its climate and botany it differs equally from the Gangetic plains to the north, and from the hot, damp, and exuberant forests of Orissa to the south. Nor are its geological features less different, or its concomitant and in part resultant characters of agriculture and native population. Still further west, the great rivers of the peninsula have their origin, the Nerbudda and Taptee flowing west to the gulf of Cambay, the Cane to the Jumna, the Soane to the Ganges, and the northern feeders of the Godavery to the Bay of Bengal.|$|E

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{germination}} of excised embryos can break dormancy rapidly and shorten {{the time required}} to produce seedlings, speeding up olive breeding programmes as well as rootstock production. In this study, the in vitro germination potential of four Sicilian olive cultivars was evaluated during two years of experiments, using explants with three different morphological configurations that represent three different degrees of embryo exposure: (1) intact <b>stoneless</b> seeds containing the embryo, the endosperm and the seed coat (Emb+En+SC), (2) seeds without the seed coat (Emb+En) and (3) naked, isolated embryos (seed coat and endosperm both removed: Emb). Differences were found in the germination percentages and timing due to both genotype and explant type. The root and shoot meristems, the radicle-hypocotyl axis, the provascular tissues and embryo storage reserves were identified as embryo anatomical structures which could influence germination capacity. Observation of these structures, however, indicated similar germination potential among cultivars, suggesting possible differences in other dormancy factors. In spite of variation in cultivar performance, after 60 days of in vitro culture all cultivars demonstrated the highest germination of naked embryos (explant type 3) and lowest for <b>stoneless</b> seeds (explant type 1); <b>stoneless</b> seeds without the seedcoat (explant type 2) showed intermediate germination percentages.

40|$|Contact {{zones of}} closely related and ecologically similar species {{constitute}} rare opportunities {{to study the}} evolutionary consequences of past speciation processes. They represent natural laboratories in which strong competition {{could lead to the}} exclusion of one species, or the various species may switch into distinct ecological niches. Alternatively, if reproductive isolation has not yet been achieved, they may hybridize. We elucidate the degree of taxon integrity by comparing genetics and habitat use of three similar-sized congeneric viper species, Vipera ammodytes, Vipera aspis, and Vipera berus, of Nadiza Valley in western Slovenia. No hybridization was detected for either mitochondrial or nuclear genomes. Similarly, external intermediacy by a single prestudy viper (probably V. ammodytes 9 V. aspis) indicates that hybridization occasionally occurs, but should be very rare. Populations of the three related viperids are partially allopatric in Nadiza Valley, but they also coexist in a narrow contact zone in the montane grassland along the south-exposed slope of Mount Stol (1673 m a. s. l.). Here, the three species that occupy areas in or near patches of rocky microhabitats (e. g. stone piles, slides, and walls) live in syntopy. However, fine-scale measurements of structural components show partial habitat segregation, in which V. berus becomes more dominant at elevations above 1400 m and occupies mostly the mountain ridge and north-exposed slopes of Mount Stol, V. aspis occurs below 1300 m and is the only species to inhabit <b>stoneless</b> patches of grass and bushes around 1000 m and lower, and V. ammodytes occurs at all elevations up to 1500 m, but is restricted to a rocky microhabitat. We suggest that a high degree of microstructure divergence, slightly different environmental niches, and a generally favourable habitat for all three viper species, keep the pressure for mis-mating and hybridization low, although mechanisms such as reduced hybrid inferiority and temporal mating segregation cannot yet be excluded...|$|E
40|$|New {{mechanisation}} methods {{associated with}} increasing loads {{have the potential}} to cause undesirable deep compaction, which is difficult, expensive and in some cases impossible to alleviate. Avoiding or reducing the risk of deep compaction seems to be the most straightforward solution to compaction management. Previous research indicates that some benefits can be achieved through interactions between cultivation tines or other implements, in terms of the magnitude of forces and the extent of soil deformation. Interaction within wheel arrangements could have benefits for reducing deep soil compaction. This study aimed {{to reduce the risk of}} deep soil deformation by locally modifying soil conditions through interactions in order to increase soil resistance and hence load support in the surface layers. To test the hypothesis, the research was based on soil mechanics theories and failure mechanisms related to bearing capacity in order to identify the major factors influencing load support and soil displacement. The nature of soil failure patterns, interaction behaviour, soil deformation and load/sinkage relationships were investigated under a wide range of dual and triple spaced footings/wheels configurations. Small-scale tests using rectangular plates were firstly conducted in a glass-sided tank. These initial tests were followed by larger-scale tests in a soil bin and in the field under different soil conditions using actual wheels, spaced and positioned as in the footing tests. The results indicate that it is possible to reduce soil displacement at depth by increasing load support in the soil surface layers through the interaction between spaced wheel arrangements. It was shown that different interaction modes occurred under dual configurations depending on the spacing between them. A locally compacted zone was created between the wheels under dense interaction conditions, increasing surface support. Surface support was increased further through a surcharging effect achieved by placing a third footing/wheel between and higher than the side wheels (triple arrangement). The central static interaction zone maximised the surface resistance locally under these configurations. Although single wide section wheels such as Terra tyres can tolerate higher loads at lower pressures, from a soil failure point of view, this is usually associated with large active and passive failure zones inducing deeper soil deformation. Triple spaced wheel arrangements with similar diameter wheels kept soil displacements shallower whilst carrying a similar load to a single very wide wheel with the same overall contact pressure. Reductions of up to 50 % in the depth of soil displacement were achieved with the triple arrangements for the same load. These spaced arrangements can therefore be recommended as promising replacement for single wide wheel under heavy machinery application in practical situations. Benefits from the spaced arrangements are achieved in two ways: firstly by increasing surface support through creating locally compacted zones and secondly by reducing the size of active and passive failure zones causing shallower deformations. Stony soils provide more surface support than <b>stoneless</b> soils and also non-uniform soil with a denser layer at tillage depth can tolerate a greater load for a given sinkage compared with uniform homogenous soil. A mathematical model was developed to predict the vertical force under interacting shallow footings and showed an acceptable level of agreement with the experimental results. The model can be used to estimate the extent of the rupture distance of the side passive planes to assist in identifying appropriate spacings and interaction modes for spaced wheel arrangements...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of organic conversions {{have been on}} upland grass-based livestock farms resulting in a shortage of UK-grown cereals and pulses. Across northern Europe, conventional agriculture has developed a specialised structure with many areas having no livestock, or knowledge or facilities to support livestock. Sustainable organic production on these farms has particular challenges for nutrient supply, {{for the management of}} weeds, pests and diseases and for economically viability. This report covers a three and a half year period (four crop harvests) of a longer-term programme of work, which began in 1990. The overall objective was to identify and overcome factors limiting the sustainability of a stockless arable rotation. Specific objectives were to 1) quantify crop yield and quality, 2) quantify the financial performance of the rotation and contrast with Farm Business Survey data from comparable non-organic arable farms, 3) to monitor and evaluate indicators of sustainability; particularly for nutrients, weeds, pests and diseases and 4) to communicate results, and their implications, to Defra and other stakeholders. These were all achieved. The study was located on the ADAS Research Centre at Terrington St Clement, Norfolk. The soil is a deep <b>stoneless</b> silty clay loam of the Wisbech series. It is derived from marine alluvium, has a naturally high pH of around 7. 5 and is retentive of water and nutrients. The project was an unreplicated study with field-scale plots. There were five plots, each of 2 ha, each in a different phase of a five-year rotation. This design, with no replication within-year, whilst allowing more meaningful crop husbandry and economic evaluation than a conventional small-plot replicated experiment, did limit statistical analysis. This was a deliberate choice as economic evaluation and demonstration were the principal initial objectives of the project. Despite this limitation, it has provided a long-term data-set gathered under realistic conditions that gave useful indicators of crop performance in a stockless rotation, and provided data for other Defra-funded projects, such as economic modelling. The project was managed by a steering group chaired by the Defra project officer. Other members included Roger Unwin, policy adviser on soil protection and organic farming in the Defra Rural Development Service, three organic farmers, and representatives of the Soil Association and Elm Farm Research Centre (EFRC). Meetings were held twice per year. Detailed written reports were submitted to each meeting for discussion. All changes to cropping and management were agreed by the group. The crop sequence from 2002 to 2004 was: potatoes and calabrese (split ⅔ potatoes and ⅓ calabrese)  winter wheat  spring beans  spring wheat (undersown)  white clover (fertility building crop). The clover was mown three to four times per year and left as a mulch. Organic registration was with the Soil Association. All crop management operations were done using normal farm machinery; the aim was to simulate typical commercial practice. No fertilisers were applied apart from aluminium calcium phosphate (“Redslaag”) once per rotation, at 625 kg/ha. No irrigation was applied. Undersown white clover thrived only in one year (2002) out of five. Establishment was affected variously by slug grazing, insufficient rain, and excessive rain. It was successfully re-sown in 2003 but had to be replaced by spring sown vetch in 2004 and 2005. Of all the crops grown post-conversion, fertility-building crops have been the most difficult to establish. Over the life of the programme, clover failed to successfully establish in four of the eleven years from 1995 to 2005, even when re-sown in some years. Vetch was sown in spring as a (reputedly) rapidly-growing replacement in three of the years but it was slow to establish, competed poorly with weeds and had a considerably lower accumulated nitrogen in the mulched foliage. The mean accumulated nitrogen in vetch was 102 kg/ha (range 90 to 121), whereas in clover it was 175 kg/ha (range 0 to 274). Despite the poor performance of some of the fertility-building crops, this was not clearly reflected in the performance of following cash crops. This conclusion was supported by results from replicated experiments comparing legume species over different seasons, done at Terrington in the 1990 s as part of this programme (and published in a peer reviewed journal), and by results from a stockless arable study on fertile soil in Germany. Yield of winter wheat was good with an average of 7. 0 t/ha; this compares with a typical organic yield of 4. 0 t/ha. Yield was relatively consistent, and reflected environmental conditions, with lowest yields in the very dry 1995 and the wet and dull 1997 and 2001. The highest yield of 9. 8 t/ha was in 1996 when a dry and sunny early summer was followed by rain in July and August ensuring good grain fill. Grain nitrogen content ranged from 1. 7...|$|E
