25|$|What {{it really}} {{highlights}} though is that nothing has really changed in our strategy, {{and that is}} that we need to re-equip, we need to grow our capacity, we need to have new products, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it just brings these objectives into focus more and more by having a high profile about what's happened.|$|E

Others will be writing things {{that will help them}} to define where they want to go. Some will be pressuring their Senators and their Congressmen to pass legislations that affect women. I don't think {{you can come up with}} any one point, women will be doing their own thing in their own way.|$|E
500|$|After {{recovering}} from the injury, Urlacher stated, [...] "I feel more powerful. I’m running to the football, my keys {{are a lot more}} clear now, and I’m playing downhill... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it did help my body kind of calm down and relax a little bit.

500|$|Actor Joshua Jackson later {{remarked that}} [...] "Johari Window" [...] was a [...] "stand-alone" [...] episode in an interview: [...] "There is nothing from that thing that {{broadens}} the story, {{except at the}} heart of it, is a story about love and acceptance and family... Which of course, for these two guys, is the entire theme of the show for them. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we've done that really well". Actor John Noble added, [...] "Tolerance. Acceptance. I loved 'Johari Window'. I thought it was one of my favourite stories".|$|E
500|$|She left Broome to {{tour the}} United States, and {{continued}} to write material on the road. While much of her first album revolved around the piano, most of the songs from On a Clear Night were guitar-based. This was because Higgins had easier access to a guitar than keyboards while touring. She said, [...] "I hadn't been playing guitar very long for the first album <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'm definitely a better guitar player, and probably a worse piano player because I haven't been able to play it much {{over the last few}} years".|$|E
500|$|On how Wilkes {{connects to}} Carter, Austin said Wilkes is [...] "one {{of the top}} {{scientists}} in his field , but he’s {{had to work hard}} to get there. It’s sort of a similar struggle of an African-American and a woman in the 1940s to try to succeed, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that they both see that in one another and that’s part of where the chemistry and connection comes from." [...] Expanding on the love triangle that forms between Wilkes, Sousa, and Carter, Austin said, [...] "we’re very nice to each other. We’re professional. I think that Sousa likes Wilkes enough and it’s the same the other way".|$|E

500|$|In 1987, the Pixies {{released}} an 18-track demo tape, {{commonly referred to}} as The Purple Tape. Thompson's father assisted the band financially, loaning $1,000 in order to record the demo tape; Thompson later said that his father [...] "wasn't around for a lot of my younger years, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he was doing his best {{to make up for lost}} time." [...] The Purple Tape led to a recording contract with the English independent record label 4AD. For the release of the mini album Come On Pilgrim, Thompson adopted the alias [...] "Black Francis", a name inspired by his father: [...] "he had been saving that name in case he had another son." ...|$|E
500|$|Lydia {{discovered}} Zoe's true intentions for befriending her, {{and set out}} to take revenge. In {{a second}} interview with E4, Lister stated: [...] "I was really surprised when I learned about Zoe's 'master plan' to get Lydia to confess because I think after everything that Zoe's been through [...] the last thing she wants to do is ever see Lydia again, let alone try and make friends with her! But that is her only way, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's really interesting." [...] She continued: [...] "The fight and the chase stuff with Lydia in the graveyard was really good, we filmed it at night. I was dressed as Madonna. We were in a cemetery, it was brilliant!..." ...|$|E
500|$|More {{than one}} hundred actors auditioned for the role, but only ten were taken seriously by the producers. Known actors such as Lou Diamond Phillips and Hart Bochner were among the auditionees for the role as Agent Doggett. Both Phillips and Bochner were {{considered}} for the role, but the producers eventually chose Robert Patrick. In an interview with, Chris Carter said [...] "I think {{it was something that}} we all talked about, but I wrote his voice. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he was someone we all came up with together, but his voice came out of my head. But, it was something that was helped in a large degree by casting Robert Patrick." ...|$|E

500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment {{published}} by HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of the episode, Benioff spoke {{about the relationship between}} Sansa Stark and Jon Snow {{at this point in the}} season, saying [...] "Over the course of this season they've come to really rely upon each other, but she doesn't really trust him completely. She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> there's a little bit of anger about that and a little bit of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch." [...] Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting [...] "We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we have to be a little worried for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I am now {{thirty miles}} above Lawrence on the Kansas River {{assisting}} in {{starting a new}} town.

Here, Mary, with God's kind permission, we will make our home; and I have every reason to believe a home it will truly be." ...|$|E

Francis finishes Deal's sentences, joking that her response to hearing of the teacher's activities {{was to try to}} join the team. Albini later observed the use of studio banter on Surfer Rosa: [...] "It's on their record forever <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> now they are obliged to say that they're ok with it, but I honestly don't know that that idea would've ever come up if I hadn't done it. There are times when things like that are revealing and entertaining and I kind of felt it was a bit gimmicky on this record." ...|$|E

500|$|Hilson and Ne-Yo {{knew each}} other from their days as co-songwriters. Hilson had {{appeared}} as Ne-Yo's love interest in the video for his song [...] "Miss Independent," [...] the second single taken from his 2008 album, Year of the Gentleman. In a September 2008 interview with Rap-Up about a recent crop of songwriters becoming singers, Ne-Yo said [...] "For one, I think Keri Hilson’s too freakin’ pretty {{to be in the}} background. For two, her voice is incredible—on top {{of the fact that she}} can write. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that she’s definitely one that deserves the spotlight." [...] In [...] "Knock You Down", Kanye West makes multiple references to Michael Jackson, and coincidentally, the song was released in numerous territories around the death of the singer.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Hillenburg {{enrolled}} in the Experimental Animation Program at CalArts: [...] "Changing careers like that is scary, but {{the irony is that}} animation is a pretty healthy career right now and science education is more of a struggle," [...] he admitted. He studied under Jules Engel, the founding director of the program, whom he considers his [...] "Art Dad" [...] and mentor. Engel accepted him into the program impressed by The Intertidal Zone. Hillenburg posited further, [...] " [...] also was a painter, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he saw my paintings and could easily say, 'Oh, this guy could fit in to this program.' I don't have any [...] animation really." [...] He graduated in 1992, earning a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Science Journal G. Wayne Clough, the 12th secretary of the Smithsonian Institution assuaged [...] the animosities between critics and proponents of the exhibition: [...] “So I don't think there's anything negative here. I think the Smithsonian tried to do it right. When we heard the concerns, we asked the community to come together and talk about it, and we listened, and some people in that audience had their minds changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's time {{in a situation like this}} to pause, and for the profession itself to say, [...] "Okay, there's a problem, what are you going to do about it? And, you remember, the United States never signed the UNESCO treaty.” ...|$|E

500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 2008, {{less than a}} year after the release of Minutes to Midnight (2007). As with Minutes to Midnight, Shinoda and Rick Rubin {{produced}} the album. Primary recording sessions for A Thousand Suns took place at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In November 2008, lead singer Chester Bennington said the new record was a concept album; he said it [...] "sound a little daunting to me, <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> my confidence level will drop, but when it was presented to us by this friend of ours, we liked the idea. It was an inspiring idea, and it was something we could relate a lot of the things we like to write about to." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Ricky Ponting from international Twenty20 cricket, there were some calls for White to be promoted to captain the side, led by his Victoria coach Greg Shipperd. [...] Despite these calls, White backed the favourite, incumbent vice-captain Michael Clarke for the role. White was eventually named as Clarke's vice-captain, although worries about Clarke's injury-prone back and his struggles with form in Twenty20 resulted in continued calls for White to take over, though White again backed Clarke, claiming [...] "Michael's {{going to do a}} great job and I'll just look forward to working with him. I'm still really young in the [...] job as well and very inexperienced at this level, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I can learn a lot off him." ...|$|E
500|$|Because of his {{fluency in}} several languages, Sarria was {{assigned}} to Intelligence School. However, following a routine background check for security clearance, he was advised that {{he would no longer}} be in the program. Sarria assumed that it was because investigators discovered his homosexuality. [...] "I mean I had no lisp, but I wasn't the most masculine guy in town... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that they figured that I was a little bit gay." [...] Sarria officially remained attached to the Signal Corps but was ordered to Cooks and Bakers School and trained as a cook. After graduating from cooking school, he {{was assigned to}} train as a scout, but deliberately failed the training because of the dangerous nature of the assignment. He was then assigned to the motor pool.|$|E
