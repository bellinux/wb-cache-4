500|$|Brian {{said that}} the song was {{inspired}} by his mother: [...] " [...] {{used to tell me}} about vibrations. I didn't really understand too much of what it meant when I was just a boy. It scared me, the word 'vibrations.' <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> dogs that would bark at people and then not bark at others, that a dog would pick up vibrations from these people that you can't see, but you can feel." [...] Brian first enlisted Pet Sounds lyricist Tony Asher for help in putting words to the idea. When Brian presented the song on piano, Asher thought that it had an interesting premise with the potential for hit status, but could not fathom the end result due to Brian's primitive piano playing style. Asher remembers: [...] "Brian was playing what amounts to the hook of the song: 'Good, good, good, good vibrations.' He started telling me the story about his mother. ... He said he’d always thought that {{it would be fun to}} write a song about vibes and picking them up from other people. ... So as we started to work, he played this little rhythmic pattern—a riff on the piano, the thing that goes under the chorus." [...] Brian wanted to call the song [...] "Good Vibes", but Asher advised that it was [...] "lightweight use of the language", suggesting that [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] would sound less [...] "trendy". The two proceeded to write a lyric for the verses, later to be discarded, in what was then the most basic section of the song.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Toxic" [...] was filmed over {{three days in}} December 2003, on a sound-stage in Los Angeles, California. It was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn, who previously worked with Spears on the music video for her 2000 single [...] "Stronger". The editor of the video was David Blackburn, who also edited [...] "Womanizer" [...] and [...] "Do Somethin'". Brad Rushing was the cinematographer. Spears first approached Kahn with a story sketch of a secret agent out for revenge against an ex-lover, to which Kahn created a treatment for. Her concept was almost fully formed and detailed, exemplifying the scene in which she drops water on the passenger's lap. Spears {{said she wanted to}} join the mile high club and be a stewardess that kissed a man in the bathroom. Kahn suggested making him a fat man, so the [...] "common man" [...] would feel represented. Spears also told him about a scene in which she would be naked and covered in diamonds. Kahn stated he was [...] "not sure what I was thinking about when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> that scene, maybe those intros to James Bond movies, but every video needs an iconic image to remember, and that's it". The choreography was a collaboration between Brian Friedman and Spears, and every scene had a completely different strictly structured routine. After the treatment was finished, Kahn proceeded to cast his friends and acquaintances, as in most of his projects. The plane passenger in which Spears drops water on was played by his long-time casting director, while the fat man in the bathroom was played by the casting director's assistant. Spears's boyfriend is played by Martin Henderson, who starred in Kahn's directorial debut Torque.|$|E
2500|$|Well, it wasn't {{really my}} idea ... I didn't like {{the thought of}} doing it like {{everyone}} else–maybe a mix through the back catalog and a few exclusive new tracks by some key artists... I wanted something more special. Then a while ago I met Emika, she’s making music herself on Ninja Tune. We sat together one day last summer and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> her last visit to Berghain. It was a regular Sunday morning and she noticed how everything in the building was resonating and vibrating and swinging and humming–she realized that there were lot of sounds coming from the building itself. That led {{to the idea of}} doing field recordings within the building while it's not open to the public ... It took about two or three weeks ... It was a four gigabyte library.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2004, Vine {{said that}} she had only seen Thomson once, in an art shop, in the {{previous}} two years. She later told The Times that it was [...] "impossible to explain" [...] why she married Thomson, that he didn't [...] "give a s*** about art or the Stuckist movement", and that he saw her as a means of gaining his own publicity: [...] "When I met him and he saw some of my history, he saw dollar signs. He is a very exploitative man." [...] Thomson said she showed herself in a manner to gain the largest amount of attention or sympathy, avoided reality and created a fantasy world : [...] "Now it makes me question a lot of things <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> her past." [...] In June 2007, Vine said that the marriage was consummated in 2001, {{a few weeks after the}} ceremony—"I owed him that"—and Thomson then paid off her debts of £20,000, after which [...] "I've never seen him again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scherzinger credits Whitney Houston {{as being}} her {{greatest}} musical influence and idol, saying {{she wanted to}} [...] "be Whitney" [...] when she grew up. She admired Houston {{so much that she}} auditioned with her version of [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] at her Popstars audition. When Scherzinger was growing up in her home town of Louisville, she received a Christmas gift (at the age of six) of a tiny purple boombox and a cassette of Whitney Houston's chart-topping 1985 self-titled debut album. [...] "My parents had no money, but they got me this player and Whitney's album, which had [...] "The Greatest Love of All" [...] on it," [...] Scherzinger recalls. [...] "That was it for me. From that moment on I wanted to sing. Her voice was so powerful; every note she sang just felt like the truth." [...] Scherzinger also named Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Roberta Flack, Sade Adu, Alanis Morissette, Toni Braxton and Tina Turner as her biggest influences while growing up. Scherzinger said that Beyoncé also inspired her, stating: [...] "I am inspired by women like Beyoncé who wear costumes that aren't much but they are real artists and they put real artistry into what they do and that is how I pride myself." [...] Scherzinger said while she is on stage performing, she borrows personas of Tina Turner and Mick Jagger: [...] "The way he [...] prances around stage and the poise he has on stage. But I love Tina Turner's attitude and sass. I steal from her all the time, especially being the lead singer of this group, the Pussycat Dolls, to be fearless and just have that attitude and that soul behind you." [...] Scherzinger also cites Gwen Stefani as an influence. Janet Jackson and MIA are also influences to her. When Scherzinger was older, Mariah Carey became a huge influence to her. She also wished to work with the Black Eyed Peas saying she admired their music. Scherzinger is also a fan of Adele. Critically acclaimed, [...] "Pop Prince", Prince also became a big influence when she was in her teens. Michael Jackson was one of Scherzinger's biggest influences and idols. Paula Abdul, who Scherzinger sat alongside on the judging panel of The X Factor, was one of her influences. When she gained the role on Men in Black 3, Scherzinger said that music was a very big part of her inspiration for the character, which she plays for the film. She said, [...] "I listened to my heavier music and I listened to Led Zeppelin and I kind of got in that frame of mind because music is what inspires me most. I worked with my acting coach a lot and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> lots of crazy things to think about while I was in character, but I better not tell you what she said." [...] Scherzinger said that the role has inspired her to record differently on her second studio album.|$|E
6000|$|Old Jolyon saw {{her lips}} tremble. She {{put her hand}} over them, took it away again, and went on calmly: [...] "That night I went to the Embankment; a woman caught me by the dress. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> herself. When one knows that others suffer, one's ashamed." ...|$|E
6000|$|Oct. 3.—I {{have seen}} the Queen again this morning. She conversed [...] longer, near an hour, and was visibly better and stronger, and in [...] good spirits. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> much <b>about</b> her illness. ... She wished [...] me a {{pleasant}} journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "`You needn't try {{to deceive}} me, Paul,' says he, tryin' {{to keep his}} temper down. `Mother's bin took bad, wi' over-excitement, the doctor says, an' <b>she's</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> the fortin an' the will, an' where Betty is down at Brighton.' ...|$|R

60|$|AMY. I don't {{know what}} you mean. All I know is that she means to give Mr. Dolphin a good talking to. He's so mercenary. It made me quite indignant when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> him. Such a schemer, too. You know in America we have very {{definite}} ideas about honour.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Last night, {{when she}} came home, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it, and showed me your answer. It was a {{beautiful}} letter, Peter. I'm sure I cried when I read it. And Cynthia did, I feel certain. Of course, to a girl of her character that letter was final. She is so loyal, dear child.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, absolutely. We're {{quite good}} friends again now. No use {{being in the}} same house and not being on {{speaking}} terms. It's rummy how the passage of time sort of changes a fellow's point of view. Why, when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> her engagement, I congratulated her as cheerfully as dammit! And only a few weeks ago...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{loved her}} too, old fellow. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> it, {{and there was}} no friend had a closer place in her heart than you. I don't know how to thank you for all you have done for her. I can't think yet [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I went a berryin' this forenoon, and up ag'in the berry lot, just in {{the edge}} of the woods, I saw a young woman, and that was the Malbone gal.

6000|$|Johnnie's {{face was}} deeply tinged; {{he bent down}} his head and did not answer, till, when the inquiry was repeated, he whispered, 'Mamma said Aunt Helen was so very good.

6000|$|FAITH. And <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> another girl--the Law {{took her}} baby from her. And {{after she was}} gone, I--got all worked up-- [She hesitates, then goes swiftly on] And I looked at mine; it was asleep just here, quite close. I just put out my arm like that, over its face--quite soft-- I didn't hurt it. I didn't really. [She {{suddenly}} swallows, and her lips quiver] I didn't feel anything under my arm. And--and a beast of a nurse came on me, and said [...] "You've smothered your baby, you wretched girl!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Why {{what their}} idea is. She went away because they didn’t fork out. She did like me awfully, and she stayed two years. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> it—that {{at last she}} could never get her wages. As soon as they saw how much she liked me they stopped giving her anything. They thought she’d stay for nothing—just because, don’t you know?” And Morgan had a queer little {{conscious}} lucid look. “She did stay ever so long—as long an she could. She was only a poor girl. She used to send money to her mother. At last she couldn’t afford it any longer, and went away in a fearful rage one night—I mean of course in a rage against them. She cried over me tremendously, she hugged me nearly to death. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> it,” the boy repeated. “She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it was their idea. So I guessed, ever so long ago, {{that they have had}} the same idea with you.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "there is Mrs. Amy, {{who was my}} mother's servant at the time (as <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> herself <b>about</b> three months ago), knows very well I am the person I pretend to be, and caused me to be thrown into jail for debts I knew nothing of, because I should not find out my mother to make myself known to her before she left England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I did," [...] said George modestly, [...] "I had no notion, till I became him, what {{a persuasive}} sort of chap my brother Alfred was. Anyway, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> it, and I started in {{to show her}} that George {{was a pretty good}} sort of fellow on the whole, who oughtn't to be turned down for what was evidently merely {{temporary}} insanity. She saw my point." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{has taken}} {{three months to}} repair and {{renovate}} our house--corner of 9th and 5th Avenue, but I shall be in it in io or 15 days hence. Much of the furniture went into it today (from Hartford). We have not seen it for 13 years. Katy Leary, our old housekeeper, {{who has been in}} our service more than 24 years, cried when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it to-day. She said [...] "I had forgotten it was so beautiful, and it brought Mrs. Clemens right back to me--in that old time when she was so young and lovely." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} sitting {{in one of}} the recesses {{at the end of the}} big saloon with Mrs. Redmondson, one of those sharp-minded, beautiful rich women one meets so often in London, who seem to have done nothing and to be capable of everything, and we watched the crowd--uniforms and splendours were streaming in from a State ball--and exchanged information. I told her about the politicians and intellectuals, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the aristocrats, and we sharpened our wit on them and counted the percentage of beautiful people among the latter, and wondered if the general effect of tallness was or was not an illusion.|$|E
6000|$|... "On the way <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the Martha, and how she'd bought her, and {{was going}} to float her. She said she'd {{chartered}} the Emily, and was sailing as soon as I could get the Flibberty underway. It struck me that her gammon was reasonable enough, and I agreed to pull out for Berande right O, and get your orders to go along to Poonga-Poonga. But she said there wasn't a second to be lost by any such foolishness, and that I was to sail direct for Poonga-Poonga, and that if I couldn't take her word that she was your partner, she'd get along without me and the Flibberty. And right there's where she fooled me.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dearest father, for I cannot {{call you}} {{anything}} else, I have just heard about my birth {{from a woman}} who calls herself my mother, and who, I suppose, has a right to do so, though certainly I shall never call her or think of her so. <b>She</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> her child and yours getting mixed, and how you brought both up in hopes of finding out some day which was which.|$|R

6000|$|Of course no preconception or prepossession {{of his own}} was {{suffered}} to bar his way to {{the final}} truth he was seeking, and he joyously renounced even a conclusion if he found it mistaken. I do not know whether Mrs. Agassiz has put into her interesting life of him, a delightful story which <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> him. He came to her beaming one day, and demanded, [...] "You know I have always held such and such an opinion about a certain group of fossil fishes?" [...] "Yes, yes!" [...] "Well, I have just been reading ------'s new book, and he has shown me that there isn't the least truth in my theory"; and he burst into a laugh of unalloyed pleasure in relinquishing his error.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{be ashamed}} of it, Bob," [...] Mr. Bale said, with a smile, laying his hand kindly on his shoulder. [...] "Your sister Carrie is an {{excellent}} young woman, {{and it is not}} difficult to read her thoughts in her letters. Of course, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> your adventure with Miss Harcourt, and she has mentioned her a good many times, since; and it did not need a great deal of discernment to see what Carrie's opinion was regarding the young lady. Carrie has her weak points--as, for example, when she took up with that wild Irishman--but she has plenty of good sense; and I am sure, by the way she wrote about this Miss Harcourt, that she must be a very charming girl; and I think, Bob, I have been looking forward almost as much, to the regiment coming home, as you have.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose not, Uncle. Such a thing {{certainly}} never entered into my calculations. I {{did not even}} know there was a white girl in the Palace, until one day she stopped me, as I was passing along the corridor near the harem, to thank me for saving her life--for it was this girl that the tiger had struck down, and was standing upon, when I fired at him. Of course, she had no idea that I was English. We only said a few words then, for if I had been seen talking to a slave girl belonging to the harem, I might have got into a scrape. However, I saw her afterwards, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> herself, and how she was afraid that she would be given away to one of Tippoo's officers. Of course, I could not leave her to such a fate as that.|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> also <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the noble-hearted Lady Jane Cavendish, the {{daughter}} of the Marquis's first marriage--how she held out a house of her father against the rebels, and acted like a brave captain, until the place was stormed, and she and her sister were made prisoners. The Roundhead captain did not treat them with over-ceremony, but such was the Lady Jane's generous nature that when the Royalists came to her relief, and he was made captive in his turn, she saved his life by her intercession.|$|R
