25|$|Hogarth {{included}} numerous {{elements in}} the painting. The scene is probably the great cabin of Graham's latest command, and the sails of ships are visible through the line of windows on {{the left of the}} painting. The furniture and objects are luxurious and the room is richly panelled and decorated. The chaplain holds a ledger and at his feet is a large famille-rose punch bowl, the punch bowl being an invitation to the viewer to join the levity at the table. He is separated from Graham across the table by a <b>salt-cellar,</b> possibly symbolising their social difference. His presence at the captain's table for this informal occasion nevertheless indicates that he is a privileged member of Graham's entourage.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the rarest}} {{items in the}} {{collection}} is the 58cm high Gloucester Candlestick, dated to c1110, made from gilt bronze; with highly elaborate and intricate intertwining branches containing small figures and inscriptions, it is {{a tour de force}} of bronze casting. Also of importance is the Becket Casket dated c1180 to contain relics of St Thomas Becket, made from gilt copper, with enamelled scenes of the saint's martyrdom. Another highlight is the 1351 Reichenau Crozier. The Burghley Nef, a <b>salt-cellar,</b> French, dated 1527–28, uses a nautilus shell to form the hull of a vessel, which rests on the tail of a parcelgilt mermaid, who rests on a hexagonal gilt plinth on six claw-and-ball feet. Both masts have main and top-sails, and battlemented fighting-tops are made from gold. These items are displayed in the new Medieval & Renaissance galleries.|$|E
6000|$|Mr Merdle, {{a little}} troubled by Bar's eloquence, looked fitfully about the nearest <b>salt-cellar</b> for some moments, {{and then said}} hesitating: ...|$|E
60|$|Would {{you also}} include, in the National Gallery, {{what may be}} called the {{handicraft}} of a nation--works for domestic use or ornament? For instance, {{we know that there}} were some <b>salt-cellars</b> designed for one of the Popes; would you have those if they came to us?--Everything, pots and pans, and <b>salt-cellars,</b> and knives.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘And {{possibly}} the mustard?’ asked his highness, as {{he offered me}} {{the contents of the}} various <b>salt-cellars</b> poured together on a plate.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} the vessel from which the silvery powder had come; it was {{certainly}} a sugar-basin; as unmistakably meant for sugar as a champagne-bottle for champagne. He wondered why they should keep salt in it. He looked {{to see if there}} were any more orthodox vessels. Yes; there were two <b>salt-cellars</b> quite full. Perhaps there was some speciality in the condiment in the <b>salt-cellars.</b> He tasted it; it was sugar. Then he looked round at the restaurant with a refreshed air of interest, to see if there were any other traces of that singular artistic taste which puts the sugar in the <b>salt-cellars</b> and the salt in the sugar-basin. Except for an odd splash of some dark fluid on one of the white-papered walls, the whole place appeared neat, cheerful and ordinary. He rang the bell for the waiter.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{ten years}} to-day since my party at Woodside," [...] she said, {{reaching}} for the small Roman <b>salt-cellar</b> of green jade that she used as an ash-tray.|$|E
6000|$|... "They'll {{come all}} in good time," [...] she said; and felt it {{necessary}} to display her extreme calmness by lifting a <b>salt-cellar</b> and sweeping up a little heap of bread-crumbs.|$|E
60|$|At {{the other}} end of the table was a partly {{unfolded}} tablecloth, a plate, a tumbler, a knife and fork, <b>salt-cellar,</b> mustard and a chair--in short, preparations for one person's supper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where are the Arethusas?--Here's their beef been smoking this half-hour."--"Fly, Betty, my dear, {{here come}} the Splendids."--"Run, Molly, my love; get the <b>salt-cellars</b> for the Highlanders."--"You Peggy, where's the Siddons' pickle-pat?"--"I say, Judy, are you never coming with that pudding for the Lord Nelsons?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{furniture}} of {{the house}} seemed never to have been changed. It was very old, somewhat scanty, but very rich--tapestry and velvet hangings, marvellous cabinets, and crystal girandoles. Here and there a group of ancient plate; ewers and flagons and tall <b>salt-cellars,</b> a foot high and richly chiselled; sometimes a state bed shadowed with a huge pomp of stiff brocade and borne by silver poles.|$|R
60|$|Most young {{married people}} {{nowadays}} start in {{life with a}} dreadful collection of ormolu inkstands covered with sham onyxes, or with a perfect museum of <b>salt-cellars.</b> We strongly recommend this book {{as one of the}} best of wedding presents. It is a complete handbook to an earthly Paradise, and its author may be regarded as the Murray of matrimony and the Baedeker of bliss.|$|R
60|$|The {{construction}} of the galliot has not altered for centuries; and the northern European nations, Danes and Dutch, still sail the salt seas in this flat-bottomed <b>salt-cellar</b> of a ship; although, in addition to these, they have vessels of a more modern kind.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Tetterby, at {{the same}} time, laid the cloth, but rather {{as if she were}} {{punishing}} the table than preparing the family supper; hitting it unnecessarily hard with the knives and forks, slapping it with the plates, dinting it with the <b>salt-cellar,</b> and coming heavily down upon it with the loaf.|$|E
60|$|She {{had brought}} the meat home {{that she should have}} eaten herself, and was already warming it on a {{gridiron}} over the fire for her father, clad in an old grey gown and a black cap, awaiting his supper at the table. A clean cloth was spread before him, with knife, fork, and spoon, <b>salt-cellar,</b> pepper-box, glass, and pewter ale-pot. Such zests as his particular little phial of cayenne pepper and his pennyworth of pickles in a saucer, were not wanting.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} the first sustained {{study of the}} material culture of dining among the gentry and ‘middling sort’ in early modern England. It focuses on the religious and ritual significance of the shared dining experience, interrogating the role objects played in engendering domestic commensality. The project establishes that through their material properties and ritualized uses, objects such as <b>salt-cellars,</b> eating utensils and banqueting trenchers, were essential instruments in the construction and communication of personal and social identities. I argue that developments in the material paraphernalia of dining functioned {{to create a sense}} of continuity and community during this period of profound religious and social change. Chapter One applies the anthropological theory of ‘distributed personhood’ to <b>salt-cellars,</b> offering new insights into why salts were considered particularly effective objects for conveying identity. Chapter Two draws connections between eating utensils and significant moments in the life cycle and argues that utensils could have strong ‘personal’ associations, which commemorated essential rites of passage and functioned as perpetual reminders of familial ties. Chapter Three investigates banqueting trenchers as tools for sociability and collective spiritual contemplation and examines how their visual and material qualities required a specific ‘performance’ from diners. As a whole, the thesis provides a framework for interpreting a neglected body of historical artefacts and it contributes new knowledge about how specific types of crafted objects communicated identity within the context of ritualized social activities...|$|R
6000|$|... "She doesn't splash a bit, or {{make any}} clatter; so I guess she's a tidy creature," [...] said Polly. [...] "How long she does rub each spoon and glass. We never shall get done. What a fuss she makes with the napkins, laying them all {{even in the}} drawer. And now she's at the <b>salt-cellars,</b> doing them just as mamma likes. I wish she'd live here, and do my work for me. Why, what's that?" [...] And Polly stopped {{fretting}} to listen; for she seemed to {{hear the sound of}} singing,--so sweet, and yet so very faint she could catch no words, and only make out a cheerful little tune.|$|R
6000|$|Wives, don't {{love your}} husbands any more: {{even if they}} cry for it, the great babies! Sing: [...] "I've had enough of that old sauce." [...] And leave off loving them or caring for them one single bit. Don't even hate them or dislike them. Don't have any stew with them at all. Just boil the eggs and fill the <b>salt-cellars</b> and be quite nice, and in your own soul, be alone and be still. Be alone, and be still, {{preserving}} all the human decencies, and abandoning the indecency of desires and benevolencies and devotions, those beastly poison-gas apples of the Sodom vine of the love-will.|$|R
60|$|The waiter, {{when this}} irony grew clearer, stammeringly {{assured him that}} the {{establishment}} had certainly no such intention; {{it must be a}} most curious mistake. He picked up the sugar-basin and looked at it; he picked up the <b>salt-cellar</b> and looked at that, his face growing more and more bewildered. At last he abruptly excused himself, and hurrying away, returned in a few seconds with the proprietor. The proprietor also examined the sugar-basin and then the salt-cellar; the proprietor also looked bewildered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go on," [...] said Boardman, looking {{about for}} his {{individual}} <b>salt-cellar,</b> which he found under {{the edge of}} his plate; and Mavering laid the whole case before him. As he made no comment on it for a while, Dan was obliged to ask him what he thought of it. [...] "Well," [...] he said, with the smile that showed the evenness of his pretty teeth, [...] "there's a kind of wild justice in it." [...] He admitted this, with the object of meeting Dan's views in an opinion.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she began}} to speak again, low, quickly, and with {{suppressed}} passion, but acting wonderfully all the while. Knowing that eyes were on her, her gestures and the expression of her face were such as might have been those of any young lady of fashion who was talking of everyday affairs, such as dancing, or flowers, or jewels. She smiled and even laughed occasionally. She played with the golden <b>salt-cellar</b> {{in front of her}} and, upsetting a little of the salt, threw it over her left shoulder, appearing to ask me if I were a victim of that ancient habit, and so on.|$|E
60|$|All the tables, however, {{were spread}} with pure white napery, the {{difference}} being only in texture, but the higher table rejoiced in the wonderful extravagance of silver plates, while the lower had only trenchers. As to knives, each guest brought {{his or her}} own, and forks were not yet, but bread, in long fingers of crust, was provided to a large amount to supply the want. Splendid <b>salt-cellars,</b> towering as landmarks to the various degrees of guests, tankards, gilt and parcel gilt or shining with silver, perfectly swarmed along the board, and the meanest of the guests present drank from silver-rimmed cups of horn, while for the very greatest were reserved the tall, slender, opal Venice glasses, recently purchased by the Countess in London.|$|R
60|$|Persisting, Bella {{gave her}} {{attention}} to one thing and forgot the other, and gave {{her attention to}} the other and forgot the third, and remembering the third was distracted by the fourth, and made amends whenever she went wrong by giving the unfortunate fowls an extra spin, which made their chance of ever getting cooked exceedingly doubtful. But it was pleasant cookery too. Meantime Miss Lavinia, oscillating between the kitchen and the opposite room, prepared the dining-table in the latter chamber. This office she (always doing her household spiriting with unwillingness) performed in a startling series of whisks and bumps; laying the table-cloth as if she were raising the wind, putting down the glasses and <b>salt-cellars</b> as if she were knocking at the door, and clashing the knives and forks in a skirmishing manner suggestive of hand-to-hand conflict.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{there are}} lots of them. I was always having fun before I became an officer. My father was one of the captains of the regiment, and I was {{generally}} in for any amusement that there was. Once at a picnic, I remember that I got hold of the <b>salt-cellars</b> and mustard-pots beforehand, and I filled up one with powdered Epsom salts, which are horribly nasty, you know, and I mixed the mustard with cayenne pepper. Nobody could make out {{what had happened to the}} food. They soon suspected the mustard, but nobody thought of the salt for a long time. The colonel was furious over it, but fortunately they could not prove that I had any hand in the matter, though I know that they suspected me, for I did not get an invitation to a picnic for a long time afterwards." ...|$|R
60|$|Caleb {{took the}} maple pole {{and went back}} to his fire. He tore the <b>salt-cellar</b> in two, and this made two very good small strips of bark. He pulled open the split end of his pole, and {{carefully}} inserted one of them, and then, holding it over a little flame which was rising from a burning brand, he set it on fire. The bark was soon in a blaze, and it writhed and curled as if it were struggling to get away; but it only clung {{to the end of the}} pole more closely; and Caleb, much pleased at the success of his experiment, waved it in the air, and shouted to Raymond to look and see.|$|E
60|$|This {{language}} was rather more than I could bear, even from an angel; so, plucking up courage, I seized a <b>salt-cellar</b> which lay within reach, and hurled {{it at the}} head of the intruder. Either he dodged, however, or my aim was inaccurate; for all I accomplished was the demolition of the crystal which protected the dial of the clock upon the mantel-piece. As for the Angel, he evinced his sense of my assault by giving me two or three hard consecutive raps upon the forehead as before. These reduced me at once to submission, and I am almost ashamed to confess that either through pain or vexation, there came a few tears into my eyes.|$|E
60|$|When the <b>salt-cellar,</b> and the fowl's breast, and the trifle, and {{the lobster}} salad were all exhausted, {{and could not}} afford standing-room for another solitary witticism, the keeper {{performed}} that very dangerous feat which is still done {{with some of the}} caravan lions, although in one instance it terminated fatally, of putting his head in the animal's mouth, and placing himself entirely at its mercy. Boswell frequently presents a melancholy instance of the lamentable results of this achievement, and other keepers and jackals have been terribly lacerated for their daring. It is due to our lion to state, that he condescended to be trifled with, in the most gentle manner, and finally went home with the showman in a hack cab: perfectly peaceable, but slightly fuddled.|$|E
6000|$|Daisy was as sunshiny {{and charming}} as ever, {{with all sorts}} of womanlinesses budding in her, for she was like her gentle mother, and delighted in {{domestic}} things. She had a family of dolls, whom she brought up in the most exemplary manner; she could not get on without her little work-basket and bits of sewing, which she did so nicely, that Demi frequently pulled out his handkerchief display her neat stitches, and Baby Josy had a flannel petticoat beautifully made by Sister Daisy. She like to quiddle about the china-closet, prepare the <b>salt-cellars,</b> put the spoons straight on the table; and every day went round the parlor with her brush, dusting chairs and tables. Demi called her a [...] "Betty," [...] but was very glad to have her keep his things in order, lend him her nimble fingers in all sorts of work, and help him with his lessons, for they kept abreast there, and had no thought of rivalry.|$|R
60|$|The {{merchant}} {{was dressed}} in very different attire to that {{in which he had}} travelled. He wore a doublet of brown satin, and hose of the same material and colour; on his shoulders was a robe of Genoa velvet with a collar, and trimming down the front of brown fur, such as the boys had never before seen. Over his neck was a heavy gold chain, which they judged to be a sign of office. The landing was large and square, with richly carved oak panelling, and, like the stairs, it was carpeted with a thick Eastern rug. Taking their hands, he led them through an open door into a large withdrawing-room. Its walls were panelled in a similar manner to those of the landing, but the carpet was deeper and richer. Several splendid armoires or cabinets similarly carved stood against the walls, and in these were gold and silver cups exquisitely chased, <b>salt-cellars,</b> and other silver ware.|$|R
5000|$|Pigs {{have long}} been {{featured}} in proverbial expressions: a [...] "pig's ear", a [...] "pig in a poke", {{as well as the}} Biblical expressions, [...] "pearls before swine" [...] and [...] "ring of gold in a swine's snout." [...] Indeed, whereas the phrase [...] "lipstick on a pig" [...] seems to have been coined in the 20th century, the concept of the phrase may not be particularly recent. The similar expression, [...] "You can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear" [...] seems to have been in use {{by the middle of the}} 16th century or earlier. Thomas Fuller, the British physician, noted the use of the phrase [...] "A hog in armour is still but a hog" [...] in 1732, here, as the Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1796) later noted [...] "hog in armour" [...] alludes to [...] "an awkward or mean looking man or woman, finely dressed." [...] The Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon (1834-1892) recorded the variation [...] "A hog in a silk waistcoat is still a hog" [...] in his book of proverbs The <b>Salt-Cellars</b> (published 1887).|$|R
6000|$|... "A gentleman {{enters the}} room bearing a rod, and along with him another bearing a tablecloth, which, after they have both kneeled three times with the utmost veneration, he spreads upon the table, and after {{kneeling}} again they both retire; then come two others, one with the rod again, the other with a <b>salt-cellar,</b> a plate, and bread; when they have kneeled as the others had done, and placed what was brought upon the table, they too retire with the same ceremonies performed by the first; at last come two nobles, richly clothed, one bearing a tasting-knife, who, after prostrating themselves {{three times in the}} most graceful manner, approach and rub the table with bread and salt, with as much awe as if the King had been present."

60|$|It was but {{the third}} day {{after he had been}} forced to take refuge in the house of old Trapbois, the noted usurer of Whitefriars, {{commonly}} called Golden Trapbois, when the pretty daughter of old Ramsay, the watchmaker, after having piously seen her father finish his breakfast, (from the fear that he might, in an abstruse fit of thought, swallow the <b>salt-cellar</b> instead of a crust of the brown loaf,) set forth from the house {{as soon as he was}} again plunged into the depth of calculation, and, accompanied only by that faithful old drudge, Janet, the Scots laundress, to whom her whims were laws, made her way to Lombard Street, and disturbed, at the unusual hour of eight in the morning, Aunt Judith, the sister of her worthy godfather.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was then}} a {{discussion}} between them whether Mr. Robarts should go at once to Mr. Mason; but it was decided at last that he should see Mr. Crawley and also write to the dean before he did so. The dean might wish to employ his own lawyer, and if so the double expense should be avoided. [...] "Always remember, Mr. Robarts, that {{when you go into}} an attorney's office door, you will have to pay for it, first or last. In here, you see, the dingy old mahogany, bare as it is, makes you safe. Or else it's the <b>salt-cellar,</b> which will not allow itself to be polluted by six-and-eightpenny considerations. But there is the other kind of tax to be paid. You must go up and see Mrs. Walker, or you won't have her help in this matter." ...|$|E
60|$|The cabin of the {{floating}} light was marvellously neat and immaculately clean. There {{was evidence of}} a well-ordered household in the tidiness with which everything was put away in its proper place, even although the fair hand of woman {{had nothing to do}} with it, and clumsy man reigned paramount and alone! The cabin itself was very small--about ten feet or so in length, and perhaps eight in width. The roof was so low that Jim could not stand quite erect because of the beams. The grate resembled a toy, and was of brass polished so bright that you might have used it for a looking-glass; the fire in it was proportionately small, but large enough for the place it had to warm. A crumb or speck of dust could scarce have been found on the floor with a microscope,--and no wonder, for whenever John Welton beheld the smallest symptom of such a blemish he seized a brush and shovel and swept it away. The books in the little library at the stern were neatly arranged, and so were the cups, plates, glasses, <b>salt-cellars,</b> spoons, and saucers, in the little recess that did duty as a cupboard. In short, order and cleanliness reigned everywhere.|$|R
60|$|As antique {{furniture}} is the fashion now-a-days, {{it was easy}} to collect all the old tables, chairs, china, and ornaments in the house, and make a pleasant place of the sunny room where a tall clock always stood; and damask hangings a century old added much to the effect. A massive mahogany table was set forth with ancient silver, glass, china, and all sorts of queer old <b>salt-cellars,</b> pepper-pots, pickle-dishes, knives, and spoons. High-backed chairs stood round it, and the guests were received by a very pretty old lady in plum-colored satin, with a muslin pelerine, and a large lace cap most becoming to the rosy face it surrounded. A fat watch ticked in the wide belt, mitts covered the plump hands, and a reticule hung at the side. Madam's daughter, in a very short-waisted pink silk gown, muslin apron, and frill, was even prettier than her mother, for her dark, curly hair hung on her shoulders, and a little cap was stuck on the top, with long pink streamers. Her mitts went to the elbow, and a pink sash was tied in a large bow behind. Black satin shoes covered her feet, and a necklace of gold beads was round her throat.|$|R
60|$|She {{was in a}} mood of the {{greatest}} depression. On arriving, and seeing what the tavern was like, she had been taken by surprise; but having gone too far to retreat, she had heroically entered {{and sat down on}} the well-scrubbed settle, opposite the narrow table with its knives and steel forks, tin pepper-boxes, blue <b>salt-cellars,</b> and posters advertising the sale of bullocks against the wall. The last time that she had taken any meal in a public place it had been with Fitzpiers at the grand new Earl of Wessex Hotel in that town, after a two months' roaming and sojourning at the gigantic hotels of the Continent. How could she have expected any other kind of accommodation in present circumstances than such as Giles had provided? And yet how unprepared she was for this change! The tastes that she had acquired from Fitzpiers had been imbibed so subtly that she hardly knew she possessed them till confronted by this contrast. The elegant Fitzpiers, in fact, at that very moment owed a long bill at the above-mentioned hotel for the luxurious style in which he used to put her up there whenever they drove to Sherton. But such is social sentiment, that she had been quite comfortable under those debt-impending conditions, while she felt humiliated by her present situation, which Winterborne had paid for honestly on the nail.|$|R
