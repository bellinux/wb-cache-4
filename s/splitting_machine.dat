50|$|Most {{firewood}} {{also requires}} splitting, which {{also allows for}} faster seasoning by exposing more surface area. Today most splitting is done with a hydraulic <b>splitting</b> <b>machine,</b> {{but it can also}} be split with a splitting maul. More unusual, and dangerous, is a tapered screw-style design, that augers into the wood, splitting it, and can be powered by either a power take-off drive, a dedicated internal combustion engine, or a rugged electric pipe-threading machine, which is safer than the other power sources because the power can be shut off more easily if necessary. Another method is to use a kinetic log splitter, which uses a rack and pinion system powered by a small motor and a large flywheel used for energy storage.|$|E

Suspicion falls on Aaron, who was the one that assembled the study group. They attempt to phone Detective Kelso, but the phone is not working. After Molly and Chantal fall out, Eddie, Jason, and Chantal leave to try and fix the phone satellite on top of the mountain. Their car soon breaks down, forcing Jason to proceed on foot. Eddie attempts to fix the car, while Chantal remains inside. The killer soon appears and knocks out Chantal before Eddie's hand is trapped inside the bonnet of the car. Chantal wakes up and panics, driving the car forward into a tree which crushes Eddie's back, killing him. The killer chases Chantal to a factory, where she accidentally activates a log <b>splitting</b> <b>machine.</b> She bumps into Aaron, who warns her he knows who the killer is. She tries to escape, but they fall into the machine, where they are both mutilated by the circular saws.|$|E

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} {{to collect data on}} Salmonella prevalence, Escherichia coli counts (ECCs), and aerobic bacteria colony counts (ACCs) on pig carcasses after chilling at the 10 largest Belgian pig slaughterhouses during 2000 through 2004. Potential risk factors of contamination associated with production parameters, technical descriptions of the installations, and cleaning and disinfection methods were assessed during investigations in the slaughterhouses. These variables were used first in a univariate analysis and then were extended to a multivariate analysis with a logistic mixed regression model for Salmonella and a linear mixed model for ECCs and ACCs with slaughterhouses as the random effect. The results indicated high variability concerning Salmonella contamination among the 10 slaughterhouses, with prevalence ranging from 2. 6 to 34. 3 % according to the area of origin. The median ECC and median ACC ranged from 0. 43 to 1. 11 log CFU/cm 2 and from 2. 37 to 3. 65 log CFU/cm 2, respectively. The results of the logistic and linear regressions revealed that some working practices such as scalding with steam, second flaming after polishing, and complete cleaning and disinfection of the <b>splitting</b> <b>machine</b> several times a day were beneficial for reducing Salmonella prevalence, ECCs, and ACCs. Changing the carcass hooks just before chilling, using water as the cleaning method, and a higher frequency of disinfection of the lairage seemed to be protective against E. coli in the multivariate mixed linear model.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} In our mouse control program at H. F. and T. B. Byrd, Inc. in Timberville, Virginia Is keeping a palatable bait before the voles until the bait can be accepted. For years we used labor needed for pruning to place an expensive bait only to be impeded by wet weather that molded the bait. This year an effort is being made to keep the bait in good condition and before the target animal for a longer time. We cut old car tires (not steel belted) given to us by a local distributor and rented his tire <b>splitting</b> <b>machine.</b> The half tire was placed under a tree where it mould least likely be in the way of mowing, brush removal, etc. The half tire placed with the arched side up makes a desirable habitat for the vole and also keeps the bait dry from falling weather. The second part of this year 2 ̆ 7 s program was putting the bait under the tire in 3 ½ ounce plastic cups (used in hospitals and nursing homes). This 1 ½¢ cup keeps the bait from absorbing moisture from the ground. In large population areas the tires are inhabited and the bait is taken in a matter of days. Areas that have less voles the tire may not be visited for a month or so. The exciting part of this program is that even after two months and several wet periods the bait is still in good condition and still available.
