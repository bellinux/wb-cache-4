Male tilefish specimens also inhibited a cavity that came from ovarian tissue and sperm sinuses.

The unreacted 5'-hydroxy groups are, to a large extent, acetylated by the capping mixture.|$|E
50|$|Among Indonesian provinces in 2010, South Sumatra {{reported}} the eleventh smallest number of Christians (114,671) or 0.49% of Christians within Indonesia.

5|$|Because of the {{specialized}} and rare circumstances {{required for a}} biological structure to fossilize, logic dictates that known fossils represent only a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> all life-forms that ever existed—and that each discovery represents only a snapshot of evolution. The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, which never demonstrate an exact half-way point between clearly divergent forms.|$|E

West Nusa Tenggara reported the second smallest number of Christians (22,756) or 0.1% of Christians within Indonesia. Slightly larger concentrations are found in Mataram, and Bima cites, both with just 2% Christians.|$|R

5|$|With {{no serious}} {{challenge}} from Republican opponents, Nixon won an overwhelming {{victory in the}} Republican primary, with his cross-filing rivals, Boddy, Douglas, and Desmond, dividing a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> the vote but running well ahead of the two fringe candidates.|$|E
5|$|Current Electoral College rules {{effectively}} force {{candidates to}} focus disproportionately on a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> pivotal swing states, while sidelining the rest. A study by FairVote {{reported that the}} 2004 candidates devoted three quarters of their peak season campaign resources to just five states, while the other 45 states received very little attention. The report also stated that 18 states received no candidate visits and no TV advertising. This means that swing state issues receive more attention, while issues important to other states are largely ignored.|$|E

5|$|Estimating {{the exact}} {{rate at which}} GRBs occur is difficult; for a galaxy of {{approximately}} {{the same size as}} the Milky Way, estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) can range from one burst every 10,000 years, to one burst every 1,000,000 years. Only a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but are probably comparable.|$|E
5|$|Holland {{suggests}} {{that under the}} reign of Arab Emperor Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, even though only a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> {{the inhabitants of the}} Empire was Muslim, Mecca was intentionally yet erroneously portrayed as Muhammad's home and the birthplace of Islam in order to provide the religion with Arabian origins. Holland argues that in doing so, the faith was dissociated from the Jewish or Christian heritage that would have been self evident at a location in the Negev.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially. Brazil is the leading {{producer}} of niobium and ferroniobium, an alloy of niobium and iron which has a niobium content of 60-70%. Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines. Although these alloys contain a maximum of 0.1%, the <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> niobium enhances the strength of the steel. The temperature stability of niobium-containing superalloys is important for its use in jet and rocket engines.|$|E

5|$|NextWorth is an {{electronics}} trade-in and recycling service. Users {{of the service}} exchange used electronics for cash or discounts on newer models. NextWorth was founded by business students at Babson College in 2005. It started as a commission-based service to help businesses setup online auctions for their used items, then changed its business model to focus on electronics trade-ins in 2006. As of late 2012, NextWorth {{was one of the}} best-known and largest electronics trade-in and recycling services in the United States, although it handles only a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> total trade-in traffic.|$|E
5|$|STAC {{stated that}} an SST would have {{economic}} performance similar to existing subsonic types. Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, {{they would be}} able to fly more sorties in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> operational costs, as it did at the time.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts {{have adopted}} a range of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most use external fertilisation: the female lays a batch of eggs, the male fertilises them and the larvae develop without any further parental involvement. A fair proportion of teleosts are sequential hermaphrodites, starting life as females and transitioning to males at some stage, with a few species reversing this process. A <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> teleosts are viviparous and some provide parental care with typically the male fish guarding a nest and fanning the eggs to keep them well-oxygenated.|$|E

5|$|There {{were also}} {{indirect}} and intangible {{costs of the}} eruption. Unemployment in the immediate region of Mount St. Helens rose tenfold in the weeks immediately following the eruption, {{and then returned to}} near-normal levels once timber-salvaging and ash-cleanup operations were underway. Only a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> residents left the region because of lost jobs owing to the eruption. Several months after May 18, a few residents reported suffering stress and emotional problems, even though they had coped successfully during the crisis. Counties in the region requested funding for mental health programs to assist such people.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} but <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> {{people have}} {{employment in the}} oil industry owing to the proximity of oil rigs on the Cromarty Firth. Other locally significant industries include forestry, tourism and catering. A significant number of people work in larger nearby localities, such as Inverness, Dingwall, Alness and Invergordon, which is why only 14% of households in the zone own no car. 10.4% {{of the population of the}} zone are self-employed, and 28% economically inactive, roughly corresponding with the Highland averages. There are also two hotels and two bars, which soak up much of the tourist income that the town generates.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{returned}} to Brunswick {{after the war}} and reopened the Planters' Hoe Company in association with George T. Lane. He ended the production of augers, which still made up a <b>small</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> production even after closing Millville Manufacturing. Allen put himself in charge of manufacturing and sales and he again secured a solid market share in the South. A prosperous trade resumed and was still strong at least until the 1880s. The company eventually expanded and began manufacturing lighter common hoes for the general public, adding to its heavy southern-style line of hoes. The Planters' Hoe Company was still a success as late as the 1890s, but it was extinct by the 1920s.|$|E

The study finds that Arkansas banks are more conservative in having <b>smaller</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> their assets devoted to loans and a <b>smaller</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> their loans devoted to real estate.
