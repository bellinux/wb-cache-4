5000|$|These loops {{are small}} in {{comparison}} to the full wave loop, typically between 5% and 30% of a wavelength in circumference but considerably larger than the small receiving loop. They are typically used on frequencies between 3 and 30 MHz. They usually consist of a single turn of large diameter conductor, and are typically round or octagonal to provide maximum enclosed area for a given perimeter. The smaller of these loops show efficiencies well below that of the self resonant loops, but where space is at a premium, can provide effective communications. Loop antennas are relatively easy to build. A small transmitting loop antenna, also known as a magnetic loop,with a circumference 10% of a wavelength or less, will have a relatively constant current distribution along the conductor, and the main lobe will be in the plane of the loop. Loops of any size between 10% and 100% of a wavelength in circumference can be built and tuned to resonance with <b>series</b> <b>reactance.</b> A capacitor is required for a circumference less than a half wave, an inductor for loops more than a half wave and less than a full wave. Loops in this size range may have neither the uniform current of the small loop, nor the double peaked current of the full sized loop and thus cannot be analyzed using the concepts developed for the small receiving loops nor the self resonant loop antennas. Performance is best determined with NEC analysis. Antennas within this size range include the halo (see below) and the G0CWT (Edginton) loop.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{shows that}} series {{capacitive}} compensation of transmission lines {{by a combination}} of Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) and dielectric capacitors lowers the cost of series compensation. The SSSC has two functions: (1) to provide some <b>series</b> capacitive <b>reactance</b> compensation; (2) to damp out incipient unstable Subsynchronous Resonance (SSR) modes. Digital simulation using HYPERSIM shows that for an overall capacitive depth of compensation of 0. 7 pu, the SSSC component is only about 1 / 3 of the capacitive Mvar. Based on the transient stability limit, the transmissibility of the line is increased by a factor of 2. 23 for a depth of compensation of 0. 7. A second objective of this thesis is to extend the application of the SSSC concept. This application is found in HVDC, where there is no synchronizing power. In the family of Voltage-Source Converter (VSC) HVDC, it is possible to embed the control of the SSSC in the converter station so that there is enhanced synchronizing power. The effectiveness of the synchronizing power (together with damping power) is demonstrated through digital simulations of a turbine-generator system which is connected to a VSC-HVDC Station. The thesis shows that the SSSC has two modes of operation: (1) the constant reactance mode, in which the SSSC voltage is proportional to the line current, and (2) the constant quadrature voltage mode, in which the SSSC voltage is a constant quadrature voltage independent of the line current. A comparison between the two modes shows that the constant reactance mode provides higher synchronizing power and has a higher transient stability limit. Eigenvalue analysis and digital simulations are the methodologies used...|$|R

30|$|Loop flow control. In principle, {{electrical}} power flows in meshed transmission systems follow physical laws’ principles {{as opposed to}} network ownership, contractual obligations or thermal limits. The difference between the physical flow or free-flow path and the contract path is termed, in the parlance of power engineers, “loop flow”. More often than not, a “loop flow” yields a degree of circulating power that leaves available capacity underutilized [1]. From the engineering vantage, this is not desirable {{and a range of}} suitable solutions have been put forward to reign on the “loop flows” and make the physical power flows to better conform to the contract paths or to ensure that no system equipment becomes overloaded on a long-term basis, compromising its integrity. The available solutions to contend with this undesirable phenomenon require the installation of new equipment considering that a trade-off between investment and operational functionality ought to be considered carefully. Conventional solutions range from the installation of new generating plants at the appropriate locations, the building of new transmission lines or the introduction of the electromechanical phase-shifting transformer. This latter component is able to alter the phase angle difference, and thus controlling the power flow, but with the problems related to any electromechanical component [41]. Alternatively, several of the power electronic-based equipment described in Section  3, have the capability to perform the same function more effectively. These devices can be classified as follows: those that alter the <b>series</b> line <b>reactance</b> (TSSC and TCSC), those that alter the phase angle (SSPS) and those that alter both parameters (SSSC and UPFC). To illustrate the free flow of power let us refer to the generic transmission system of Fig.  21. It is assumed, {{for the purpose of this}} discussion, that Area 1 and Area 2 export power to Area 3 through the mesh of AC and DC transmission lines shown in the figure. It is further assumed that the power flows follow the transmission paths A-B, B-C, A-C and that the installation of the phase shifter SSPS in line A-C becomes necessary in order to limit the power flow through this transmission line, below its rated power capacity, which would otherwise become exceeded. It is clear that transmission lines A-B and B-C would have spare rating capacity to carry the ensuing re-directed power flows. On the other hand, the parallel AC/DC transmission path linking nodes C and D provides a fair degree of dynamic power regulation, using the fast power controllability afforded by the point-to-point HVDC link and the AC transmission line with variable series impedance control.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2005. The {{continuously}} {{growing demand}} for electric power requires transmitting larger amounts of power over long distances. An economically attractive solution to increase the power transfer through a long interconnection (up to a limit) without building new parallel circuits is to install series capacitor compensation on the transmission line. Large disturbances which constantly occur in power systems may disrupt the synchronous operation of the generators and lead to out-of-step conditions. Coordinated insertion and removal of the compensating capacitors in series with a transmission line is an approach that {{has been known for}} many years to be capable of enhancing the transient stability of power systems as well as providing additional damping to the power system oscillations. The relatively recent emergence of the thyristor controlled series capacitor (TCSC) has now made this method of transient stability enhancement practically feasible. This thesis compares a range of different strategies that have been proposed in the literature for control of <b>series</b> compensating <b>reactance</b> to enhance transient stability. Initially a simple swing-equation model of a single-generator power system, including an idealised controllable series compensator (CSC) is used to study the fundamental characteristics of the variable impedance control and its impact on transient stability. Subsequently, a detailed model of a small study system is developed, including a detailed representation of a TCSC, for more in-depth analysis. This detailed study system model is then used to compare three different transient stability control schemes for the TCSC, namely: generator speed-deviation based bang-bang control, discrete control based on an energy-function method, and nonlinear adaptive control. Time-domain results are presented to demonstrate the impact of the TCSC on first swing stability of the SMIB system with the above control schemes for various fault scenarios. The performance of each control scheme is also compared by evaluating {{the extent to which it}} extends the transient stability margin of the study system. For each of the three different TCSC control approaches considered, the results show that variable impedance control of the TCSC provides further improvement in the transient stability limits of the study system over and above the improvement that is obtained by having a fixed-impedance TCSC in the system. In the case of the bangbang and discrete control approaches, it is shown that a combination of a large steady state value of the TCSC compensation, together with a relative small range of variable TCSC reactance under transient conditions, offers. the best improvement in the transient stability limits for the studied system. The results also show that there is little difference in the extent to which the energy function method of TCSC control improves the transient stability limits over the improvement obtained using speed-deviation bang-bang control of the TCSC for the study system considered...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an open loop method of controlling FACTS devices for power oscillation damping. The method {{is based on}} step-wise <b>series</b> <b>reactance</b> modulation. The principle of the method is to stabilize an oscillation in a power system which is characterized by one major mode of oscillation by switching a reactance in series with one transmission line, thereby changing the total reactance between the areas participating in the oscillation. In order to stabilize the system during an oscillation, the stationary voltage angle difference between the areas is changed {{to coincide with the}} present angle at a point where the speed of the lumped machine representations of the areas is nominal. This is the case at the peaks of the oscillation. To determine the required size of the reactance step, a reduced model of the power system is used. The model parameters are continuously updated using local measurements of the active power on the reactance controlled line. Several approaches for damping with different numbers of steps are presented and verified using digital simulations of power system models...|$|E
30|$|Basically, the TCSC would {{exhibit the}} {{behaviour}} of a variable <b>series</b> <b>reactance</b> {{governed by the}} TCR’s firing angle α. Therefore, {{it should be possible}} to adjust the reactance of the line to perform an effective regulation of the power flow through the series compensated transmission line. Depending on the firing angle, the TCSC may operate in capacitive or inductive modes. However, there is little incentive for inductive operation since this would increase the electrical length of the transmission line, with adverse consequences on stability margins, and extra losses [3]. Note that in this case the TCR harmonic currents do not tend to escape towards the network; instead, the harmonics are trapped inside the TCSC because of the low impedance of the capacitor compared to the network equivalent impedance [10]. TCSCs have been installed in countries that have long transmission distances, such as the USA, Brazil, China and India. It seems that there is limited scope for using this technology in Europe, with the Nordic countries being the exception. Indeed, Fingrid Oyj, the Finish TSO, has shown recent interest in upgrading some of their series compensated transmission lines to include the dynamic characteristics afforded by the TCSC.|$|E
40|$|Harmonic {{resonance}} {{occurs when}} the network equivalent shunt harmonic capacitive reactance {{is associated with the}} network <b>series</b> harmonic inductive <b>reactance.</b> When such resonance occurs, it amplifies harmonic components with frequency close to the resonance point. Solutions used to solve harmonic resonance problems can be divided into two main categories. One is to reduce the content of harmonic components in the network (e. g. by using active or passive harmonic filters, etc.) and the other is to remove the resonance stimulating factor by shifting away the resonance frequency to a non-critical frequency range (e. g. detuning PFC capacitors, redesigning feeder transformers, etc.). Studies show that these techniques are not adequate to solve harmonic resonance problems in power distribution networks which are dynamic by their nature and with complex interconnections. Due to this, solutions in the category one are designed for localised harmonic distortion compensation, while solutions in the category two lack real-time operation feature. Therefore, it was identified {{that there is a need}} for real-time harmonic resonance attenuation that is suitable for power distribution networks. In this thesis, a new real-time Harmonic Resonance Attenuation (HRA) technique is proposed. This technique may be used with ordinary shunt harmonic filters to make them behave like a virtual shunt capacitor or inductor. Thus, looking from the harmonic current source side, the filter alters the network harmonic impedance and hence results in harmonic resonance attenuation. In order to implement the HRA technique, fast measurement of system harmonics in real-time is required. Therefore, in this work, a fast individual harmonic extraction (FIHE) technique is developed to enhance the desired real-time operation of the HRA. The proposed FIHE needs only one sixth of the fundamental cycle to extract any individual harmonic component which is faster than other methods currently available. In addition to the speed, the proposed FIHE provides overshoot free, oscillation free and ripple free extraction characteristics. The proposed HRA and FIHE techniques are described in this thesis with detailed analysis to illustrate their operating principles. A series of simulations and experiments are conducted to evaluate their functionality and performance. Results of the evaluation are presented and discussed in this thesis together with details of the experimental HRA model developed to verify the theoretical and simulation results.

The concept of two-port network is applied to simplify the mathematical model of the power system. The proposed method is tested on sample system and compared on various cases. Results: The first swing of rotor angle curve of the faulted system without resistance is obviously {{higher than that of}} with resistance whereas the second swing of the faulted system without resistance is slightly less than that of with resistance. Conclusion: It was found from this study that the resistance of the line provides the improvement of the first swing but not for the second swing. The simulation results indicate that for practical medium line, the resistance is very import parameters to determine the critical clearing time of the single machine infinite system whereas shunt capacitance doesn’t affect on the critical clearing time of the single machine infinite bus system...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: The Static Var Compensator (SVC) {{have been}} widely {{investigated}} its effect on transient stability of Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) system. The exact medium transmission line model in power system consists of the series resistance <b>series</b> <b>reactance</b> and shunt capacitance. It is not easy task to obtain the mathematical model of the SVC with the exact medium transmission line model for investigating transient stability performance. Approach: This study applied {{the concept of the}} two-port network to simplify the mathematical model of the power system. The full capacity of the SVC on transient stability improvement of the SMIB with the medium transmission line was then investigated. The proposed method was tested on sample system and compared on various cases. Results: The first swing of rotor angle curve of the faulted system without resistance was obviously higher than that of with resistance whereas the second swing of the faulted system without resistance was slightly less than that of with resistance. The system with a SVC could improve transient stability of power system. Conclusion: The SVC and resistance of the line can improve first swing of rotor angle. The resistance of the line provides negative effect on second swing of rotor angle. The simulation results indicate that for practical medium line, the resistance is very import parameters for evaluating transient stability of power system...|$|E
