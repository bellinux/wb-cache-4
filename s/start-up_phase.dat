50|$|If {{the heating}} plant is only {{working at a}} small {{fraction}} of its maximum and the turndown ratio is too low, at some point the burner will still need to be shut off when the desired pressure/temperature is achieved. This in turn leads to a rapid reduction in temperature/pressure, requiring the boiler to restart. Cycling frequency can be as high as 12 times per hour. This is undesirable, as flue gases are purged during both the shut-down and <b>start-up</b> <b>phases,</b> leading to energy losses and therefore inefficiency. Additionally, typical startup times for boilers are in the order of one to two minutes, leading to an inability to respond to sudden load demands.|$|R

40|$|The Monte Carlo {{criticality}} {{simulation of}} decoupled systems, as {{for instance in}} large reactor cores, has been a challenging issue for a long time. In particular, due to limited computer time resources, the number of neutrons simulated per generation is still many order of magnitudes below realistic statistics, even during the <b>start-up</b> <b>phases</b> of reactors. This limited number of neutrons triggers a strong clustering effect of the neutron population that affects Monte Carlo tallies. Below a certain threshold, {{not only is the}} variance affected but also the estimation of the eigenvectors. In this paper we will build a time-dependent diffusion equation that takes into account both spatial correlations and population control (fixed number of neutrons along generations).

40|$|The {{relation}} between turbulent transport and {{scrape off layer}} width is investigated in circular plasmas toroidally limited on the inner wall. A broad range of experimental observations collected in the Tore Supra scrape off layer are detailed and compared to turbulent interchange models. Blob velocities agree reasonably well with an analytical model derived for isolated blobs. A set of 2 D isothermal turbulence simulations are used to derive a scaling law for the density width. Quantitative agreement is found between this model scaling and experimental density width measured in Tore Supra, over a large set of plasma conditions. The sensitivity to control parameters (major radius, safety factor and normalized Larmor radius) is roughly explained by {{the sensitivity of the}} blob velocity model. The predictions are also extended to power decay length in limited plasma configurations.

40|$|Existing {{studies of}} early {{international}}izing firms (aka born globals or international new ventures) have paid surprisingly {{little attention to}} the geographical context within which such firms emerge, how this context might influence their emergence and performance, or whether {{they are more likely to}} emerge in certain regional environments. Hence this paper seeks to contribute to the growing literature on international entrepreneurship by developing a preliminary conceptual model of the emergence of early internationalizing firms in geographical context. The model is developed from a three-part, interdisciplinary review of relevant literature. It seeks to build upon the resource-/knowledgebased view from the business and management literature by integrating insights from research in ‘spatial disciplines’ such as economic geography (notably work on clusters). In the model, a distinction is first made between upstream (pre start-up) and downstream (post <b>start-up)</b> <b>phases.</b> Various ways in which geographical context may influence firms’ inheritance (upstream) and acquisition (downstream) of the resources, capabilities and knowledge required for early internationalization in each of these phases are then depicted. The model complements existing conceptualizations and may provide a basis for further empirical and conceptual work on geographical aspects of the early internationalization phenomenon...|$|R

The author investigates how the Swedish Trade Councilcan facilitate and bridge the contacts between venture capitalists in the UK andhigh-tech start-ups in Sweden. High-tech ventures in the <b>start-up</b> <b>phases</b> often face a challenge in accumulatingsufficient financial resources and skills to successfully move from concept stage tobusiness, particularly within the life sciences’. High costs associated to time consumingand demanding product development cycles may require external investors whichprovide venture capital and expertise. However, many face difficulties in attractingventure capital partly due to the so-called equity gap, which relates to financiersunwillingness for taking on risk and investing in the early-stages. The study shows that venture capital largely rely on local networks and are limited intheir investments’ geographical distribution. The interviewed market players alsoemphasise the importance of local networks in the investment processes. Given thesecharacteristics, it may be difficult for a Swedish company seeking venture capitalabroad without help from intermediaries. Although there is a role to fill forintermediaries in assisting in the investment discovery process, it is likely to provedifficult over time as tasks become increasingly cumbersome...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{utilization of}} green resources is driving research toward {{the design and}} development of new and more efficient energy harvesting systems. As far as the wind energy sector is concerned, aerodynamic design and the definition of new airfoils, specifically devoted to the application of wind rotors, has given a huge impulse in this direction. However, the rigid blade concept is still an important constraint in energy extraction during off-design conditions or <b>start-up</b> <b>phases.</b> In order {{to cope with this}} problem, a new system has been developed and manufactured within the specifically funded VENTURAS® (VENTo: Una Risorsa Altamente Sfruttabile or ‘wind: a highly exploitable resource') Project. The new system applies morphing to modify blade twisting along the blade span (modifying the pitch angle of some sections) while maintaining the same chord distribution as the design configuration. This innovation offers the possibility of partially adapting the blade configuration to the operating point, thus improving rotor efficiency. Design details mechanisms and deformable skin are discussed. Application to small/-micro wind turbines seems the most promising field for such equipment, but its extension to different fields (such as UAV morphing wings) could be of a certain interest as far as energy saving is concerned...|$|R
30|$|However, {{in labor}} research, {{plausible}} {{reasons for the}} possible relevance of swarm organization can be given {{in the context of}} the adoption of digitized production systems: An effective system control by skilled workers can be assured with minimally regulated, informal and cooperative forms of work processes (Lee and Seppelt 2009; Cummings and Bruni 2009). Moreover, it is quite possible in the context of such a model of work organization to maintain control over real-time decision-making and communication processes (Spath et al. 2013, p.  115). In addition it is emphasized that complex systems change states “spontaneously” and have intransparent and unpredictable effects (Grote 2005) that require highly flexible workplace interventions that are as unplannable as they are uncontrollable. In addition, it is assumed that the lengthy introduction and <b>start-up</b> <b>phases</b> of Industry 4.0 systems are due to their complexity, in the course of which activities and work organization must show a high degree of flexibility and problem-solving skills, while still far from able to reach a definable (end-) state. Finally, the “lifecycle” of complex systems is referred to, which can always involve new system states that are difficult to control; both unexpected start-up problems, as well as current problems and unexpected disturbances in normal operation can subsequently only be overcome in the context of open and informally designed forms of work (BMWi 2013).|$|R

40|$|Emissions from {{residential}} combustion appliances vary significantly {{depending on}} the firing behaviours and combustion conditions, in addition to combustion technologies and fuel quality. Although wood pellet combustion in residential heating boilers is efficient, the combustion conditions during <b>start-up</b> and stop <b>phases</b> are not optimal and produce significantly high emissions such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon from incomplete combustion. The emissions from the <b>start-up</b> and stop <b>phases</b> of the pellet boilers are not fully {{taken into account in}} test methods for ecolabels which primarily focus on emissions during operation on full load and part load.  The objective of the thesis is to investigate the emission characteristics during realistic operation of residential wood pellet boilers in order to identify when the major part of the annual emissions occur. Emissions from four residential wood pellet boilers were measured and characterized for three operating <b>phases</b> (<b>start-up,</b> steady and stop). Emissions from realistic operation of combined solar and wood pellet heating systems was continuously measured to investigate the influence of <b>start-up</b> and stop <b>phases</b> on total annual emissions. Measured emission data from the pellet devices were used to build an emission model to predict the annual emission factors from the dynamic operation of the heating system using the simulation software TRNSYS.  Start-up emissions are found to vary with ignition type, supply of air and fuel, and time to complete the phase. Stop emissions are influenced by fan operation characteristics and the cleaning routine. <b>Start-up</b> and stop <b>phases</b> under realistic operation conditions contribute 80 – 95 % of annual carbon monoxide (CO) emission, 60 – 90 % total hydrocarbon (TOC), 10 – 20 % of nitrogen oxides (NO), and 30 – 40 % particles emissions. Annual emission factors from realistic operation of tested residential heating system with a top fed wood pelt boiler can be between 190 and 400 mg/MJ for the CO emissions, between 60 and 95 mg/MJ for the NO, between 6 and 25 mg/MJ for the TOC, between 30 and 116 mg/MJ for the particulate matter and between 2 x 1013 and 4 x 1013 /MJ for the number of particles. If the boiler has the cleaning sequence with compressed air such as in boiler B 2, annual CO emission factor can be up to 550 mg/MJ. Average CO, TOC and particles emissions under realistic annual condition were greater than the limits values of two eco labels. These results highlight the importance of <b>start-up</b> and stop <b>phases</b> in annual emission factors (especially CO and TOC). Since a large or dominating part of the annual emissions in real operation arise from the start-up and stop sequences, test methods required by the ecolabels should take these emissions into account. In this way it will encourage the boiler manufacturers to minimize annual emissions.  The annual emissions of residential pellet heating system can be reduced by optimizing the number of start-ups of the pellet boiler. It is possible to reduce up to 85 % of the number of start-ups by optimizing the system design and its controller such as switching of the boiler pump after it stops, using two temperature sensors for boiler ON/OFF control, optimizing of the positions of the connections to the storage tank, increasing the mixing valve temperature in the boiler circuit and decreasing the pump flow rate. For 85 % reduction of start-ups, 75 % of CO and TOC emission factors were reduced while 13 % increase in NO and 15 % increase in particle emissions was observed...|$|R
