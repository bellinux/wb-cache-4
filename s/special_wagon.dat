The wagons provided for both these traffic flows (both those owned by the GWR and the mining companies) were fitted with end doors that allowed their loads to be tipped straight into the ships' holds using wagon-tipping equipment on the dockside. <b>Special</b> <b>wagons</b> were produced for many other different commodities such as gunpowder, aeroplanes, milk, fruit and fish.|$|R

50|$|<b>Special</b> <b>wagons</b> for {{specific}} purposes or <b>wagons</b> with <b>special</b> features were already being introduced around 1850 by private companies.

50|$|The {{distinction}} with UIC Class U wagons is fluid.

50|$|These wagons {{were based}} on the {{standard}} covered wagon but developed for special roles and were always built in smaller numbers.

The first order for 87 vehicles was placed in July 1982 with deliveries running from 1983 onwards.

The German Border Guard had a total of 121 TM 170, but these have now been phased out of service.|$|E
5000|$|A {{passage in}} the book is clearly {{intended}} as satire of the already formidable American advertising industry.

The barrel length of a half-kartouwen is 32 to 34 times the caliber, which ranges between 105 mm and 115 mm. Its barrel weighs 110 kg to 150 kg, the whole gun 170 kg to 240 kg. Half-kartouwen fired cannonballs weighing between 8 lb and 10 lb, and for the transport of its barrel, 10 to 16 horses were needed.|$|E
5000|$|Eilzüge first ran in Germany in 1907.

50|$|A crew of 100 men and 30 to 40 horses was {{required}} to harvest the ice. The crew waited for a foot of black ice to form in the lake. Snow was swept off and snow-ice was scraped off by horse-drawn vehicles if necessary. Then, a horse-drawn cutting tool, the marker, scored a grid 2-3 inches deep forming 21-inch squares over two to three acres of ice. Men with saws cut along a line in one direction while men with ice spades knocked the blocks free from the strip. Another crew with ice hooks drew the ice along ramps onto platforms. Full platforms were slid onto sledges for transport to ice houses on the shore. An ice house was built of pine walls filled with sawdust to a thickness of 2 ft. The blocks were packed in sawdust for transport, moved to a train in a <b>special</b> <b>wagon</b> and brought directly to a wharf in Boston. The blocks arrived in Boston {{within an hour of}} the cutting with no loss. Transport to Britain by ship lost {{about a third of the}} ice.|$|E

They had to have <b>special</b> <b>wagon</b> that could handle the weight and rough use. These wagons typically would cost about $400 (approximately [...] ). The wagons had wooden hoops that went {{from one side to}} the other which were covered by a canvas top which would be waterproofed with linseed oil. The canvas protected the immigrants and their goods from weather and the sun. The wagons would be packed with food supplies, cooking equipment, water kegs, and other things needed for a long journey. Knowing that this was the only chance they had to transport their goods and that they may not be able to get what they needed where they were going, the pioneers usually over-packed their wagons. This often led to the wagons breaking down and the draw animals being overly fatigued. It was common to see route along the wagon trails littered with household items that had been cast off along the journey.|$|E

50|$|This is {{the largest}} group of flat wagons both in terms of variety and numbers. Their {{classification}} as <b>special</b> <b>wagons</b> arises either as a result of not having a wagon deck that is drivable or due to their axle count.
