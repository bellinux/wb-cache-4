40|$|In this study, simple {{expressions}} for the, anistropic rigidities of orthogonally rib-stiffened {{reinforced concrete}} <b>slab</b> <b>structures</b> are presented. These expressions are valid for both, the pre-cracking and post-cracking stages of concrete, and are, therefore, applicable to reinforced {{as well as}} prestressed concrete structures. Bending and twisting tests on several orthogonally rib-stiffened reinforced concrete <b>slab</b> <b>structures</b> were conducted. The experimental results of twisting tests show that using shear reinforcement (stirrups) has {{a significant effect on}} increasing the pre-cracking and post-cracking torsional rigidities, so proposed equations for estimating these torsional rigidities were developed to properly account for the presence of stirrups. The experimental results of bending tests verify that using stirrups has no effect on both the pre-cracking and post-cracking flexural rigidities, so the existing equations for determining these flexural rigidities were not modified. The structural response of orthogonally rib-stiffened reinforced concrete slabs to loads was observed. It shows that using stirrups leads to ductile behavior of such structures. The experimental procedure and the necessary precautions that must be taken to help ensuring accurate results were discussed. The use of realistic estimates for the torsional constants of rib-stiffened reinforced concrete <b>slab</b> <b>structures</b> when using shear reinforcement will lead to better design as well as economy.

5000|$|Nanocavities {{made from}} {{photonic}} crystals are typically implemented in a photonic crystal <b>slab</b> <b>structure.</b> Such a slab will generally have a periodic lattice structure of physical {{holes in the}} material. For light propagating within the slab, a reflective interface is formed at these holes due to the periodic differences in refractive index in the structure. [...] A common photonic crystal nanocavity design shown is essentially a photonic crystal with an intentional defect (holes missing). This structure having periodic changes in refractive index {{on the order of}} the length of the optical wavelength satisfies Bragg reflection conditions in the y and z directions for a particular wavelength range, and the slab boundaries in the x direction create another reflective boundary due to oblique reflection at dielectric boundaries. This results in theoretically perfect wave confinement in the y and z directions along the axis of a lattice row, and good confinement along the x direction. Since this confinement effect along the y and z directions (directions of the crystal lattice) is only for a range of frequencies, it has been referred to as a photonic bandgap, since there is a discrete set of photon energies which cannot propagate in the lattice directions in the material. However, because of the diffraction of waves propagating inside this structure, radiation energy does escape the cavity within the photonic crystal slab plane. The lattice spacing can be tuned to produce optimal boundary conditions of the standing wave inside the cavity to produce minimal loss and highest Q.|$|E

40|$|A {{multiscale}} {{method is}} presented {{for analysis of}} thin <b>slab</b> <b>structures</b> in which the microstructures {{can not be reduced}} to two-dimensional plane stress models and thus three dimensional treatment of microstructures is necessary. This method is based on the classical asymptotic expansion multiscale approach but with consideration of the special geometric characteristics of the <b>slab</b> <b>structures.</b> This is achieved via a special form of multiscale asymptotic expansion of displacement field. The expanded three dimensional displacement field only exhibits in-plane periodicity and the thickness dimension is in the global scale. Consequently by employing the multiscale asymptotic expansion approach the global macroscopic structural problem and the local microscopic unit cell problem are rationally set up. It is noted that the unit cell is subjected to the in-plane periodic boundary conditions as well as the traction free conditions on the out of plane surfaces of the unit cell. The variational formulation and finite element implementation of the unit cell problem are discussed in details. Thereafter the in-plane material response is systematically characterized via homogenization analysis of the proposed special unit cell problem for different microstructures and the reasoning of the present method is justified. Moreover the present multiscale analysis procedure is illustrated through a plane stress beam example...|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the author}} investigates the behaviour of reinforced and prestressed concrete waffle slabs from initial to collapse load. The theoretical treatment covering {{the whole range}} of load, is divided into three parts: elastic analysis, ultimate analysis, and progressive failure analysis. The elastic analysis part is based on a Fourier series solution for simply supported slabs and this is extended to continuous waffle <b>slab</b> <b>structures.</b> The ultimate limit state analysis is obtained by adopting the yield line theory as an upper bound solution. The progressive failure analysis is tackled by the finite element method as a numerical technique; beyond the initiation of the first crack at sections of maximum stresses, an iterative incremental procedure is adopted {{to take into account the}} reduction of rigidities with the corresponding increment of loading, thus converting the non-linear problem into a series of incrementally linear problems in the elastic-plastic range. Comparison of results is made between skew and rectangular waffle slabs as well as between continuous slabs on isolated supports and on continuous line-supports. A study of the effect of rotating the isolated column support line about the center of the bridge on the structural response is undertaken. The theoretical analyses are substantiated and verified by experimental results obtained from tests on seven models of reinforced and prestressed concrete waffle slab bridges. The deflections and strains obtained from the tests are found to be in good agreement with the theoretical solutions. From this study it is concluded that the yield-line analysis is simple and reliable in predicting the ultimate load of waffle <b>slab</b> <b>structures.</b> Furthermore, prestressed concrete waffle slab construction is well suited for use in large span structures. Also, in predicting the collapse load of waffle <b>slab</b> <b>structures,</b> it is found that the progressive failure analysis of such structures gives results which are in close agreement with those obtained from the tests as well as from the yield-line analysis.
