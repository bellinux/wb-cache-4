5|$|As the {{recurrent}} nerve hooks {{around the}} <b>subclavian</b> <b>artery</b> or aorta, it gives off several branches. There is suspected {{variability in the}} configuration of these branches to the cardiac plexus, trachea, esophagus and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle.|$|E
5|$|During {{the third}} {{hour after the}} shooting, an autopsy was {{performed}} due to overwhelming media interest. It revealed that the bullet had entered Selena's upper right back, near her shoulder blade, passed through her chest cavity, severed the right <b>subclavian</b> <b>artery,</b> and exited her right upper chest.

5|$|Arches 4 and 6 {{produce the}} {{laryngeal}} cartilages. The nerve {{of the sixth}} arch becomes the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The nerve of the fourth arch {{gives rise to the}} superior laryngeal nerve. The arteries of the fourth arch, which project between the nerves of the fourth and sixth arches, become the left-sided arch of the aorta and the right <b>subclavian</b> <b>artery.</b> The arteries of the sixth arch persists as the ductus arteriosus on the left, and is obliterated on the right.|$|E

5|$|In roughly 1 out {{of every}} 100200people, the right {{inferior}} laryngeal nerve is nonrecurrent, branching off the vagus nerve around {{the level of the}} cricoid cartilage. Typically, such a configuration is accompanied by variation in the arrangement of the major arteries in the chest; most commonly, the right <b>subclavian</b> <b>artery</b> arises from {{the left side of the}} aorta and crosses behind the esophagus. A left nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal nerve is even more uncommon, requiring the aortic arch be on the right side, accompanied by an arterial variant which prevents the nerve from being drawn into the chest by the left subclavian.|$|E
5|$|The vagus nerves, {{from which}} the {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves branch, exit the skull at the jugular foramen and travel within the carotid sheath alongside the carotid arteries through the neck. The recurrent laryngeal nerves branch off the vagus, the left at the aortic arch, and the right at the right <b>subclavian</b> <b>artery.</b> The left RLN passes {{in front of the}} arch, and then wraps underneath and behind it. After branching, the nerves typically ascend in a groove at the junction of the trachea and esophagus. They then pass behind the posterior, middle part of the outer lobes of the thyroid gland and enter the larynx underneath the inferior constrictor muscle, passing into the larynx just posterior to the cricothyroid joint. The terminal branch is called the inferior laryngeal nerve.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{arise from}} the <b>subclavian</b> <b>artery,</b> and run through the transverse foramen of the upper six vertebrae of the neck. After exiting {{at the level of}} the first cervical vertebra, its course changes from vertical to horizontal, and then enters the skull through the foramen magnum. Inside the skull, the arteries merge to form the basilar artery, which joins the circle of Willis. In total, three quarters of the artery are outside the skull; it has a high mobility in this area due to rotational movement in the neck and is therefore vulnerable to trauma. Most dissections happen {{at the level of the}} first and second vertebrae. The vertebral artery supplies a number of vital structures in the posterior cranial fossa, such as the brainstem, the cerebellum and the occipital lobes. The brainstem harbors a number of vital functions (such as respiration) and controls the nerves of the face and neck. The cerebellum is part of the diffuse system that coordinates movement. Finally, the occipital lobes participate in the sense of vision.|$|E

25|$|After {{ligature}} of {{the common}} carotid, the collateral circulation can be perfectly established, by the free communication which exists between the carotid arteries of opposite sides, both without and within the cranium, and by enlargement of {{the branches of the}} <b>subclavian</b> <b>artery</b> on the side corresponding to that on which the vessel has been tied.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{hypotension}} at {{presentation is}} a grave prognostic indicator. It is {{usually associated with}} pericardial tamponade, severe aortic insufficiency, or rupture of the aorta. Accurate measurement of the blood pressure is important. Pseudohypotension (falsely low blood-pressure measurement) may occur due to involvement of the brachiocephalic artery (supplying the right arm) or the left <b>subclavian</b> <b>artery</b> (supplying the left arm).|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the close}} {{proximity}} of the lung to the brachial plexus {{at the level of}} the clavicle, the complication most often associated with this block is pneumothorax — with a risk as high as 6.1%. Further complications of supraclavicular block include <b>subclavian</b> <b>artery</b> puncture, and spread of local anesthetic to cause paresis of the stellate ganglion, the phrenic nerve and recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E

25|$|In June 1864, Hooker was the {{adjutant-general}} for the First Brigade, Second Division, Eighteenth Army Corps, {{in charge}} of nine regiments during the Battle of Cold Harbor. Hooker received several serious wounds during the battle: he was shot five times, twice in the legs, twice in the body, once through the left shoulder, and one that shattered his collar bone, leaving the <b>subclavian</b> <b>artery</b> bare. Hooker, however, recovered and {{was assigned to the}} Third Division, Twenty-fourth Corps and served with the First Brigade. After the surrender of Richmond {{and the end of the}} war, Hooker tendered his resignation but was refused twice. Hooker was able to muster out with the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1865.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{landmarks}} {{can be used}} {{to identify}} the appropriate location for injection of local anesthetic, which is typically lateral to (outside) the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and above the clavicle, with the first rib generally considered to represent the limit below which the needle must not be directed (the pleural cavity and uppermost part of the lung are located at this level). Palpation or ultrasound visualization of the <b>subclavian</b> <b>artery</b> just above the clavicle provides a useful anatomic landmark for locating the brachial plexus, which is lateral to the artery at this level. Proximity to the brachial plexus can be determined using by elicitation of a paresthesia, use of a peripheral nerve stimulator, or ultrasound guidance.|$|E
25|$|The first {{percutaneous}} supraclavicular {{block was}} performed in 1911 by German surgeon Diedrich Kulenkampff (18801967). Just as his older colleague August Bier (18611949) had done with spinal anesthesia in 1898, Kulenkampff subjected himself to the supraclavicular block. Later that year, Georg Hirschel (18751963) described a percutaneous approach to the brachial plexus from the axilla. In 1928, Kulenkampff and Persky published their experiences with a thousand blocks without apparent major complications. They described their technique with the patient in the sitting position or in the supine position with a pillow between the shoulders. The needle was inserted above {{the midpoint of the}} clavicle where the pulse of the <b>subclavian</b> <b>artery</b> could be felt and it was directed medially toward the second or third thoracic spinous process.|$|E

She underwent endovascular plugging and depressurization of the aberrant artery and a carotid-subclavian bypass using right supraclavicular access. The second patient, a 77 -year-old woman who presented with a 5. 5 -cm aneurysm at the origin of a previously bypassed aberrant artery on the distal aortic arch, was treated using bilateral carotid-subclavian bypasses through neck incisions and a thoracic endoluminal graft exclusion of the arch aneurysm that covered both <b>subclavian</b> <b>arteries...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} Poland {{syndrome}} is unknown. However, an interruption of the embryonic blood {{supply to the}} arteries that lie under the collarbone (<b>subclavian</b> <b>arteries)</b> at about the 46th day of embryonic development is the prevailing theory.|$|R

25|$|In 1895, Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts (United States) {{established}} {{a population of}} domestic albino brown rats to {{study the effects of}} diet and for other physiological studies. Over the years, rats have been used in many experimental studies, which have added to our understanding of genetics, diseases, the effects of drugs, and other topics that have provided a great benefit for {{the health and well-being of}} humankind. The aortic arches of the rat are among the most commonly studied in murine models due to marked anatomical homology to the human cardiovascular system. Both rat and human aortic arches exhibit subsequent branching of the brachiocephalic trunk, left common cartoid artery and left <b>subclavian</b> <b>artery,</b> as well as geometrically similar, non-planar curvature in the aortic branches. Aortic arches studied in rats exhibit abnormalities similar to those of humans, including altered pulmonary arteries and double or absent aortic arches. Despite existing anatomical analogy in the inthrathoracic position of the heart itself, the murine model of the heart and its structures remains a valuable tool for studies of human cardiovascular conditions.|$|E

A shallower groove in front of the artery and {{near the edge of the}} lung, lodges the left brachiocephalic vein. The esophagus may sit in a wider shallow impression at the base of the lung.|$|E
500|$|On July 30, Richard {{went to see}} a {{chiropractor}} who rotated his neck to fix the flow of blood in his upper torso region. Later that day, Richard was participating in warm-ups before the game when he suffered a major stroke and collapsed in the outfield. Before the stroke, he had a headache and a feeling of weakness through his body. Eventually, that progressed into vision problems and paralysis in {{the left side of his}} body. A massive blockage in his right carotid artery necessitated emergency surgery that evening. An examination by neurologist William S. Fields showed that Richard was still experiencing weakness in his extremities and on the left side of his face. He also had blurred vision through his left eye. A CAT scan of Richard's brain later showed that Richard had experienced three separate strokes from the different obstructions in his arterial system. Furthermore, the arteries in his right arm were still obstructed. Later examinations showed that Richard was suffering from extensive arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. While pitching, his clavicle and first rib pinched his <b>subclavian</b> <b>artery.</b> As a result of this problem, Richard would feel normal for the first few innings of the game but after putting repeated pressure on his <b>subclavian</b> <b>artery,</b> his arm would start to ache in pain and eventually start to feel [...] "heavy". His wife at the time, Carolyn, told reporters, [...] "It took death, or nearly death, to get an apology. They should have believed him." ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Normally, {{the arch}} of aorta gives three branches- brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid and left <b>subclavian</b> <b>arteries.</b> The {{variations}} in the branching pattern of aortic arch are numerous due to the altered development of the fourth aortic arch during the embryonic period of gestation. These variations maybe of great surgical importance. Many variations occur in the number and position of vessels arising from the aortic arch. Variations in the branching pattern of aorta are due to the altered development of the fourth aortic arch during the embryonic period of gestation. Aortic arch in human is produced by the persistence {{and development of the}} left fourth arch. Usually, {{the arch of}} aorta gives three branches, i. e. brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid and left <b>subclavian</b> <b>arteries.</b> The variations of branching patterns of aortic arch are numerous. Although, many of these variations cause no disturbance in the functions of the body, they may be of great importance to the surgeon. MATERIALS AND METHODS 50 human cadaveric hearts with intact arch of aortae from the Department of Anatomy, Government T. D. Medical College, Alappuzha, Kerala, were used to study its branching patterns. RESULTS The usual branching pattern of aorta into three branches, i. e. brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid and left <b>subclavian</b> <b>arteries</b> was found in 78...|$|R
