25|$|The iodolactonization {{transform}} affords an allylic alcohol {{leading to}} a key Baeyer-Villiger intermediate. This oxidation regioselectively inserts an oxygen atom between the ketone and the most electron-rich site. The pivotal intermediate leads to a straightforward conversion to the Diels-Alder structural goal, which provides the carbon framework for the functionalized cyclopentane ring. Later Corey developed an asymmetric Diels-Alder reaction employing a chiral oxazoborolidine, greatly simplifying the <b>synthetic</b> <b>route</b> to the prostaglandins.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Smith and his {{co-workers}} have reported the first gram-scale synthesis of (+)-discodermolide, which make the development of (+)-discodermolide as a potential chemotherapeutic agent possible. This <b>synthetic</b> <b>route</b> was licensed to Novartis Pharmaceuticals. One of the major improvements was that no purification was required {{in the first four}} steps of the five-step sequence towards the common precursor as the intermiedate, aldol adduct, is a crystalline solid. A chelation-controlled Mukaiyama-aldol reaction was used to set the stereogenicity at C(5) of the lactone fragment.|$|E
25|$|Polyacetylene can be {{synthesized}} by ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) from cyclooctatetraene, {{a material}} easier to handle than the acetylene monomer. This <b>synthetic</b> <b>route</b> {{also provides a}} facile method for adding solubilizing groups to the polymer while maintaining the conjugation. Robert Grubbs and coworkers synthesized a variety of polyacetylene derivatives with linear and branched alkyl chains. Polymers with linear groups such as n-octyl had high conductivity but low solubility, while highly branched tert-butyl groups increased solubility but decreased conjugation due to polymer twisting to avoid steric crowding. They obtained soluble and conductive polymers with sec-butyl and neopentyl groups, because the methylene (CH2) unit directly connected to the polymer reduces steric crowding and prevents twisting.|$|E
25|$|Many of Woodward's syntheses were {{described}} as spectacular by his colleagues and before he did them, it was thought by some {{that it would be}} impossible to create these substances in the lab. Woodward's syntheses were also described as having an element of art in them, and since then, synthetic chemists have always looked for elegance as well as utility in synthesis. His work also involved the exhaustive use of the then newly developed techniques of infrared spectroscopy and later, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Another important feature of Woodward's syntheses was their attention to stereochemistry or the particular configuration of molecules in three-dimensional space. Most natural products of medicinal importance are effective, for example as drugs, only when they possess a specific stereochemistry. This creates the demand for 'stereoselective synthesis', producing a compound with a defined stereochemistry. While today a typical <b>synthetic</b> <b>route</b> routinely involves such a procedure, Woodward was a pioneer in showing how, with exhaustive and rational planning, one could conduct reactions that were stereoselective. Many of his syntheses involved forcing a molecule into a certain configuration by installing rigid structural elements in it, another tactic that has become standard today. In this regard, especially his syntheses of reserpine and strychnine were landmarks.|$|E

In early episodes, a once common clandestine route, the Nagai red phosphorus/iodine method, is depicted, which uses pseudoephedrine as a precursor to d-(+)-methamphetamine. By the season 1 finale, Walt chooses to use a different <b>synthetic</b> <b>route</b> based on the difficulty of acquiring enough pseudoephedrine to produce on the larger scale required. The new method Walt chooses is a reductive amination reaction, relying on phenyl-2-propanone and methylamine. On the show, the phenyl-2-propanone (otherwise known as phenylacetone or P2P) is produced from phenylacetic acid and acetic acid using a tube furnace and thorium dioxide (ThO2) as a catalyst, as mentioned in episodes [...] "A No Rough-Stuff-Type Deal" [...] and [...] "Más". P2P and methylamine form an imine intermediate; reduction of this P2P-methylamine imine intermediate is performed using mercury aluminium amalgam, as shown in several episodes including [...] "Hazard Pay".|$|E
