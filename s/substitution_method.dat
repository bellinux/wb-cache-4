40|$|Abstract:- Textual <b>substitution</b> <b>methods,</b> {{often called}} {{dictionary}} methods or Lempel-Ziv methods, after the important work of Lempel and Ziv, are one-dimensional compression methods that maintain a constantly changing dictionary of strings to adaptively compress {{a stream of}} characters by replacing common substrings with indices (pointers) into a dictionary. Lempel and Ziv proved that the proposed schemes were practical as well as asymptotically optimal for a general source model. Two-dimensional (i. e. images) applications of textual <b>substitution</b> <b>methods</b> have been widely studied in the past. Those applications involve first {{the application of a}} linearization strategy to the input data, and then the encoding of the resulting mono-dimensional vector using LZ type one-dimensional methods. More recent strategies blend textual <b>substitution</b> <b>methods</b> with Vector Quantization. In this paper we discuss the textual <b>substitution</b> <b>methods</b> for image compression, with particular attention to the AVQ class of algorithms, and review recent advances in the field...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} generalized {{linear regression}} analysis with left-censored covariate {{due to the}} lower limit of detection. Complete case analysis by eliminating observations with values below limit of detection yields valid estimates for regression coefficients, but loses efficiency; <b>substitution</b> <b>methods</b> are biased; maximum likelihood method relies on parametric models for the unobservable tail probability distribution of such covariate, thus may suffer from model misspecification. To obtain robust and more efficient results, we propose a semiparametric likelihood-based approach for the estimation of regression parameters using an accelerated failure time model for the covariate subject to limit of detection. A two-stage estimation procedure is considered, where the conditional distribution of the covariate with limit of detection given other variables is estimated prior to maximizing the likelihood function.

40|$|The {{substitution}} of a nonresponding unit with one not originally {{selected in the}} sample is a commonly used method for dealing with unit nonresponse. Although frequently used in practice, substitution is largely neglected in the survey sampling literature. To date, few studies have attempted to develop a formal framework for describing and evaluating <b>substitution</b> <b>methods,</b> and {{little research has been}} done to improve estimates obtained through the use of substitution as a nonresponse adjustment procedure. This dissertation presents the results from three research studies conducted to enhance our understanding of <b>substitution</b> <b>methods</b> and develop new procedures to improve them. The first study investigates <b>substitution</b> <b>methods</b> in stratified two-stage cluster sampling with nonresponse at the primary sampling unit (PSU) level. A simulation study is presented to evaluate the error properties of substitution procedures compared to other standard nonresponse adjustments. The results show that the use of a matching procedure in the selection of substitutes produces estimates with similar error properties to standard nonresponse-weighted estimates, but the <b>substitution</b> <b>methods</b> have the advantage of producing more accurate standard errors than strata collapsing strategies used in the presence of PSU nonresponse in stratified cluster sampling. The second study extends an existing multiple imputation method proposed by Rubin and Zanutto (2002) that adjusts differences between nonrespondents and their substitutes on observable covariates to a more economically viable alternative. A new calibration approach is also proposed to perform such adjustments. Simulation results show that the multiple imputation extension performs as well as its predecessor, with the advantage of lower survey costs. Moreover, the proposed calibration procedure produces more precise estimates than the imputation methods with the same level of bias reduction, yielding estimates with smaller mean squared error. The third study develops a novel procedure to accommodate nonignorable nonresponse in the substitution selection itself. The approach uses pattern-mixture models following Little and Andridge (2011) and Little (1994), and introduces a parameter {{that can be used in}} sensitivity analysis to assess assumptions about the nonresponse mechanism. Simulation studies show that the proposed approach can provide practitioners with useful information to evaluate the risk of nonresponse bias...|$|R

Transfer functions to receiver points are measured by invoking the reciprocity principle. For airbome sound transfer two methods are described that model a radiating surface {{with the aid of a}} distribution of point monopole sources. A "deterministic" variant uses the volume acceleration distribution and a "Statistical " variant the radiated power distribution.
