50|$|A bitumen {{is a term}} {{applied to}} both coal tar pitch and asphalt products. Modified Bitumens were {{developed}} in Europe in the 1970s when Europeans became concerned with the lower performance standards of roofing asphalt. Modifiers were added to replace the plasticizers that had been removed by advanced methods in the distillation process. The two most common modifiers are APP (atactic polypropylene) from Italy and SBS (<b>styrene-butadiene-styrene)</b> from France. The United States started developing modified bitumen compounds in the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|Copolymers can undergo microphase {{separation}} to form {{a diverse}} array of periodic nanostructures, {{as shown in the}} example of the <b>styrene-butadiene-styrene</b> block copolymer shown at right. Microphase separation can be understood by analogy to the phase separation between oil and water. Due to chemical incompatibility between the blocks, block copolymers undergo a similar phase separation. However, because the blocks are covalently bonded to each other, they cannot demix macroscopically as water and oil can, and so instead the blocks form nanometer-sized structures. Depending on the relative lengths of each block and the overall block topology of the polymer, many morphologies can be obtained, each its own phase of matter.|$|E
50|$|Polystyrene {{generally}} has stiffness, transparency, processibility, and dielectric qualities {{that make it}} useful. However, its low impact resistance at low temperatures makes catastrophic fracture failure when cold more likely. The most widely used version of toughened polystyrene is called high impact polystyrene or HIPS. Being cheap and easy to thermoform (see thermoforming), it is utilized for many everyday uses. HIPS is made by polymerizing styrene in a polybutadiene rubber solution. After the polymerization reaction begins, the polystyrene and rubber phases separate. When  phase separation begins, the two phases compete for volume until phase inversion occurs and the rubber can distribute throughout the matrix. The alternative emulsion polymerization with <b>styrene-butadiene-styrene</b> or styrene-butadiene copolymers allows fine-tuned manipulation of particle size distribution. This method makes use of the core-shell architecture.|$|E
50|$|Styrene block {{copolymers}} (SBC), {{also called}} styrene copolymer adhesives and rubber-based adhesives, have good low-temperature flexibility, high elongation, and high heat resistance. They are frequently used in {{hot melt adhesive}} applications, where the composition retains tack even when solidified; however non-pressure-sensitive formulations are also used. High heat resistance, good low-temperature flexibility. Lower strength than polyesters. They usually have A-B-A structure, with an elastic rubber segment between two rigid plastic endblocks. High-strength film formers as standalone, increase cohesion and viscosity as an additive. Water-resistant, soluble in some organic solvents; cross-linking improves solvent resistance. Resins associating with endblocks (cumarone-indene, α-methyl styrene, vinyl toluene, aromatic hydrocarbons, etc.) improve adhesion and alter viscosity. Resins associating to the midblocks (aliphatic olefins, rosin esters, polyterpenes, terpene phenolics) improve adhesion, processing and pressure-sensitive properties. Addition of plasticizers reduces cost, improves pressure-sensitive tack, decrease melt viscosity, decrease hardness, and improve low-temperature flexibility. The A-B-A structure promotes a phase separation of the polymer, binding together the endblocks, with the central elastic parts acting as cross-links; SBCs do not require additional cross-linking, <b>styrene-butadiene-styrene</b> (SBS), used in high-strength PSA applications styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS), used in low self-adhering non-woven applications, styrene-ethylene/propylene (SEP), styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS), used in low-viscosity high-tack PSA applications, vinyl ethers.|$|E
5000|$|Block {{copolymers}} {{are interesting}} {{because they can}} [...] "microphase separate" [...] to form periodic nanostructures, as in the <b>styrene-butadiene-styrene</b> block copolymer shown at right. The polymer is known as Kraton and is used for shoe soles and adhesives. Owing to the microfine structure, the transmission electron microscope or TEM was needed to examine the structure. The butadiene matrix was stained with osmium tetroxide to provide contrast in the image. The material was made by living polymerization so that the blocks are almost monodisperse, so helping to create a very regular microstructure. The molecular weight of the polystyrene blocks in the main picture is 102,000; the inset picture has a molecular weight of 91,000, producing slightly smaller domains. The spacing between domains has been confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering, a technique which gives information about microstructure.Since most polymers are incompatible with one another, forming a block polymer will usually result in phase separation, and the principle has been widely exploited since {{the introduction of the}} SBS block polymers, especially where one of the block is highly crystalline. One exception to the rule of incompatibility is the material Noryl, where polystyrene and polyphenylene oxide or PPO form a continuous blend with one another.|$|E

Using less different block lengths, a [...] "hexagonally packed cylinder" [...] geometry can be obtained. Blocks of similar length form layers (often called lamellae in the technical literature). Between the cylindrical and lamellar phase is the gyroid phase. The nanoscale structures created from block copolymers could potentially be used for creating devices for use in computer memory, nanoscale-templating and nanoscale separations.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{types of}} base {{materials}} {{are used to}} make asphalt shingles: A formerly-living organic base and fiberglass base. Both types are made {{in a similar manner}} with asphalt or modified-asphalt applied to one or both sides of the asphalt-saturated base, covered with slate, schist, quartz, vitrified brick, stone, or ceramic granules and the back side treated with sand, talc or mica to prevent the shingles from sticking to each other before use. The top surface granules block ultra-violet light which causes the shingles to deteriorate, provides some physical protection of the asphalt and gives the shingles their color. Some shingles have copper or other materials added to the surface to help prevent algae growth. Self-sealing strips are standard on shingles to help prevent the shingles from being blown off by high winds. This material is typically limestone or fly-ash-modified resins, or polymer-modified bitumen. American Society of Civil Engineers ASTM D7158 is the standard most United States residential building codes use as their wind resistance standard for most discontinuous, steep-slope roof coverings (including asphalt shingles) with the following class ratings: Class D - Passed at basic wind speeds up to and including 90 mph; Class G - Passed at basic wind speeds up to and including 120 mph; and Class H - Passed at basic wind speeds up to and including 150 mph. An additive known as <b>styrene-butadiene-styrene</b> (SBS), sometimes called modified or rubberized asphalt, is sometimes added to the asphalt mixture to make shingles more resistant to thermal cracking, as well as more resistant to damage from hail impacts. Some manufacturers use a fabric backing known as a [...] "scrim" [...] on the back side of shingles to make them more impact resistant. Most insurance companies offer discounts to homeowners for using Class 4 impact rated shingles.|$|E
