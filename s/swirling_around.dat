25|$|Following the {{off-season}} departure of Kevin Durant, trade speculation began <b>swirling</b> <b>around</b> Westbrook, with his contract set to expire in 2017. The Thunder {{were determined to}} keep Westbrook and held off all trade talks {{in order to work}} out an extension. On August 4, 2016, Westbrook signed a three-year, $85.7 million contract extension with the Thunder. In the Thunder's second game of 2016–17 on October 28, Westbrook recorded his 38th career regular-season triple-double with 51 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists in a 113–110 overtime win over the Phoenix Suns, marking the first 50-point triple-double since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had one in 1975. Westbrook also took a career-high 44 shots. Two days later, he recorded 33 points, 12 rebounds and 16 assists in a 113–96 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, joining Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Jerry Lucas as the only players in NBA history with two triple-doubles in the first three games of a season. On November 30, he recorded his fourth straight triple-double with 35 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists in a 126–115 overtime win over the Washington Wizards, becoming just the second player in NBA history to average a triple-double heading into December (joining Robertson). He extended that streak to seven straight on December 9 with 27 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 102–99 loss to the Houston Rockets—the longest triple-double streak since Michael Jordan had seven straight in 1989.|$|E

Forrest Wickman of Slate magazine interpreted the song as different in terms of music and lyrics to the latter song. Wickman praised Usher's vocals, describing them as [...] "calculated" [...] {{to make you feel}} [...] "uneasy, <b>swirling</b> <b>around</b> in minor harmonies".

500|$|Dunstanburgh's ruins {{became a}} popular subject for {{artists from the}} end of the 18th century onwards. Thomas Girtin toured the region, and painted the castle, his picture {{dominated}} by what art historian Souren Melikian describes as [...] "the forces of nature unleashed", with [...] "wild waves" [...] and dark clouds <b>swirling</b> <b>around</b> the ruins. J. M. W. Turner was influenced by Girtin, and when he first painted the castle in 1797 he similarly focused on the wind and the waves around the ancient ruins, taking some artistic licence with the view of the castle to reinforce its sense of isolated and former grandeur. Turner drew on his visit to produce further works in oils, watercolours, etchings and sketches, through until the 1830s, making the castle one of the most common subjects in his corpus of work.|$|E

The soundtrack was presented in Dolby Digital 4.1, with one reviewer saying that the [...] "stereo separation is great with ocean waves <b>swirling</b> <b>around</b> you, the bubbles going by during the scuba scenes, and Hoagie's airplane flying around behind you." [...] The same reviewer praised the image transfer of McPherson's [...] "extremely well photographed" [...] cinematography. The film was re-released on DVD by Universal on June 3, 2003 in an anamorphic transfer.

500|$|When Missouri sought {{statehood}} in 1820, it {{sparked a}} heated debate that eventually ended with the Missouri Compromise, which allowed {{it to be a}} slave state with the admission of Maine as a free state. Prior to this compromise, various proposals were floated all <b>swirling</b> <b>around</b> allowing or prohibiting slavery in the new state. A majority of Virginia's representatives in Congress desired the retention of slavery in Missouri at any price, however Floyd was silent, and his biographer, Ambler, has inferred from various statements made by Floyd, that he preferred immediate statehood to an extension of slavery, though admits there is [...] "little evidence to show that he opposed the latter on general principles." [...] However, when anti-slavery forces in Congress tried to expunge a clause in Missouri's state constitution that would have prevented free blacks from settling in the state, Floyd opposed on the principal of state's rights to decide its own matters and also because he was opposed to the growing Federal power.

500|$|It {{was at this}} time, {{that the}} Nat Turner slave {{rebellion}} occurred on August 21, 1831. In November, he decided to recommend to the General Assembly gradual abolition of slavery, either for the whole state, or for the counties west of the Blue Ridge Mountains if the former could not be attained, but with a goal for abolition for the whole state in time. However, something caused him to change his mind, for his annual message did not contain this recommendation. Instead he encouraged delegates from the western counties to introduce its discussion. However, the debate became heated and Floyd and others [...] "became alarmed" [...] and eastern delegates talked of splitting the state. As Floyd observed: [...] "a sensation had been engendered which required great delicacy and caution in touching." [...] As a result, a vote was instead put forth on whether the state should legislate this issue. The pro-slavery party narrowly won sixty-seven to sixty. During Floyd's address to the General Assembly, he did, however, touch upon the national issues <b>swirling</b> <b>around</b> the country. As Floyd's biographer noted: ...|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio was {{the first}} actor to be cast in the film. Nolan {{had been trying to}} work with the actor for years and met him several times, but was unable to {{convince}} him to appear in any of his films until Inception. DiCaprio finally agreed because he was [...] "intrigued by this concept—this dream-heist notion and how this character's going to unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life." [...] He read the script and found it to be [...] "very well written, comprehensive but you really had to have Chris in person, to try to articulate {{some of the things that}} have been <b>swirling</b> <b>around</b> his head for the last eight years."

The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is one such example of this, comprising a vast region of the North Pacific Ocean rich with anthropogenic wastes.
