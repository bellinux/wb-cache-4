40|$|The aim of {{this study}} has been to analyse the effects of state {{subsidies}} within agriculture. The goal of these policies was to build up long-term sound and profitable farms by means of both general and selective support measures. The investments affecting structure gave rise to the following questions: (a) What were the effects on a farm of a given type of aid? (b) How were the farms and the surrounding community affected? (c) In what respect was a desirable effect achieved, and in what respect were the results problematical? The investigation was carried out in three municipalities in Norrland, and considered three different forms of subsidy (SR-, A- and B-support) which were utilized during the years 1961 - 1978. In addition to these so-called "subsidized farms", a similar number of "comparative farms" that had not received support were selected. In all, 650 farms were investigated. The evaluation was mainly divided into five areas of interest: (a) Farm reconstruction, (b) Farm development, (c) The farmers, (d) Economic effects, (e) Social effects in the locality. The principal findings were as follows: (1) SR- and A-supported farms were characterized by farmers who were relatively young, had good education and who used a portion of their working-hours for carrying out organizational measures. The comparative farms were distinguished rather by older farmers with less education and with a higher degree of employment outside the farm. (2) All of the SR-and B-supported farms had survived. Some A-supported farms were abandoned, while the number of comparative farms was greatly reduced. (3) All types of <b>subsidized</b> <b>farms</b> exhibited growth in their areas of arable land and forest and in their stock of milk cows, whereas the comparative farms were relatively unchanged. (4) Improved production results within crop husbandry could be derived simultaneously from the increased use of pipe drainage, shorter periods between ploughing, new methods of harvesting, etc. Within all these areas the <b>subsidized</b> <b>farms</b> had higher proportions of improvements than the comparative farms. (5) Since SR-farms in particular (but even A-farms) financed their rationalization measures by means of bank loans, they all became extremely sensitive to risks. In thi s way they all too easily ended up with economic difficulties when major increases in interest rates or changes in costs or revenues occurred. (6) In the short term the rationalization of the size of <b>subsidized</b> <b>farms</b> had little effect on outmigration from the areas concerned. (7) The households were larger on <b>subsidized</b> <b>farms</b> than in the comparative group. This meant that the <b>subsidized</b> <b>farms,</b> which were increasing their relative share of the population, also comprised a stabilizing factor in a locally-dependent service sector. digitalisering@um...|$|R

Since households tend to have multiple plots which are controlled by different members of the household, there may be intra-household issues that arise in the use of farm inputs available to the household. We find that while male-headed households are more likely to receive coupons than female-headed households, there seems to be less bias in intra-household use of subsidized fertilizers (or fertilizers in households receiving subsidy) between plots controlled by female and male members. This is despite the fact that, more generally, household incomes from various sources tend to be controlled and allocated by men. It also contrasts with evidence that plots controlled by female members were less likely to be applied with fertilizers when we consider all fertilizers in subsidized and unsubsidized households...|$|E

This study considers two potential savings programs, Farm and Ranch Risk Management (FARRM) accounts and Counter-Cyclical (CC) farm {{savings accounts}}. FARRM accounts use tax deferral as the primary incentive for participation and under CC accounts the government would match farmer deposits up to $ 5, 000.

The study illustrates how the selection of different income to define eligibility will impact the potential eligibility and benefits received by the accounts. In particular, if measures do not correct for changes in farm size, the value of the accounts to commercial farmers will be greatly reduced. Although participation and benefit estimates vary by the specific net and gross income measures used to define participation and allow withdrawals, the differences were relatively small. The analysis indicates that most commercial dairy farms would be eligible to build substantial balances in the accounts. The use of net income measures as opposed to gross income measures increases the likelihood that farmers will be able to access the funds deposited in the accounts. Agricultural Finance,...|$|E

With respect to access to coupons the main challenges were sharing of coupons, fewer numbers of coupons relative {{to the number of}} qualifying beneficiaries, malpractices by officials and the process of identification, particularly use of identification cards. Access to subsidized inputs was more problematic due to long queues, frequent stock outs, long distances to markets and payment of tips and bribes.

The {{millions}} of impoverished {{people living in}} developing countries including Ghana were the worst affected by the phenomenal increases in world food prices. This paper examines {{the implications of the}} global food crisis on the trends of food prices in the Upper East Region of Ghana. The data used for the analyses were average monthly prices of some selected grain cereals, grain legumes, vegetables, and root and tuber food items consumed in the region. The data were gathered from the Upper East Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. The analyses revealed that on the average, the prices of food items grew over 200 percent during the last twenty years. However, the all time record high increase in food prices in the Upper East Region of Ghana was recorded in 2008 which is estimated as over 100 percent. It is concluded that the global food crisis among other things translated positively in terms of prices in the Upper East Region of Ghana. This has had negative effects on the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals especially on the reduction of extreme poverty and hunger in the area where over 80 percent of the people are said to be poor.

With the policy change, the rice farming industry collapsed and those farmers who failed to recognize the downward spiral in earnings, following poor record keeping, discovered the worsening situation only too late and thus went bankrupt.

Structured questionnaires {{were used to}} collect data from 100 female-headed farmers selected from four villages in Nasarawa Local Government Area using multi-stage random sampling techniques. Descriptive statistics and Cobb-Douglas functional form were {{used to analyze the}} primary data obtained. The study revealed that 51 % of the farmers were in age bracket of 21 - 50 years, 63 % widowed, 64 % with no formal education, 81 % had no access to extension contacts, 100 % small farm sizes, 93 % had more than 10 years of farming experience and 42 % earned gross farm income of less than N 50, 000. OLS estimation showed significant R 2 of 0. 844 (84. 4 %) which indicated a good fit of the model. Farm size, years of farming experience, membership of farmers ’ association, cost of production and access to credit were the important significant factors determining poverty level in the study area. Skipping of meals, reduction of quantity of meal and purchased of less preferred food items topped the poverty copping strategies. Lack of right to land inheritance by women, dependent on limited personal savings and inefficient work done by hired labour were some of the factors perpetuating poverty among the farmers. The study concluded that the socio-economic characteristics of the female-headed household farmers determine their poverty levels. It recommended that policy makers should manipulate factors such as farm size, membership of farmers ’ association, cost of production and access to credit to reduce poverty. This could be done by improving extension services, provision of formal source of credit and supply of <b>subsidized</b> <b>farm</b> inputs and legislation on method of land acquisition to do away with blind customs that deprived female access to land.

40|$|Social {{protection}} measures are poverty reduction interventions implemented {{to assist in}} reducing poverty shocks of communities. This study considered the Farm Input Subsidy Programme (FISP) that has been implemented in Malawi {{with the aim of}} reducing poverty amongst subsistence farmers by providing them with <b>subsidized</b> <b>farm</b> inputs. The study was conducted in the rural area of Lilongwe District, under Traditional Authority Kabudula. The study mainly focussed on the outcomes of implementing the FISP and it entails whether or not the poverty reduction intervention is really achieving its goals. Thus, the study greatly evaluates the effectiveness of subsidizing farm inputs in reducing poverty amongst households in rural communities characterised by subsistence farming. This study was mainly qualitative in nature and data was collected through interviews and Focus Group Discussions. Some quantitative data for specific trends of national indicators was collected through document. Mainly, content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data and descriptive statistical analysis with the aid of Microsoft Excel was engaged to analyse the quantitative data. The study found that that FISP assist in household food security only in the short term. Among the reasons cited, the package size received by households has become smaller with sharing tendencies that have been devised to help households that do not receive the inputs or qualify to receive them. This practice is compromising the agricultural productivity in terms of quantities as it lasts only in the short-term before the next harvest. When households’ food reserves are depleted, households become food insecure and poverty sets in again. The study thus reveals that FISP implementation is not operating as a sustainable programme as its intended goal is not being achieved in the long-term. The study also found that coupled with {{the fact that there is}} no clear policy guidelines on graduation and that there is continued benefitting of the same beneficiaries, FISP is nowhere close to its phasing-out stage in social protection perspective...|$|E

However, this measure to some extend appears to be counterproductive, especially when the price cocoa beans increase in the world market without increase in the producer price. As a result, farmers are likely to respond to price signals in the opposite directions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} {{economic}} viability of Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). The growing concern over food safety and a desire to be closer to the source of their food has led consumers to demand local and organic produce. CSA farms use sustainable agricultural practices to provide its shareholders in the community with fresh and quality fruits and vegetables. The system is one of mutual commitment where farmers and consumers share the inherent risks and potential bounty of the harvest. This study examines the characteristics of CSA farms to understand the economic, environmental and social motivations behind running or joining a CSA operation. We find that current share prices of CSA farms do not reflect all of the costs of production, and hence might not be an economically viable approach to sustainable agriculture if CSA farms continue their current pricing strategy. We discuss the possibility of raising share prices and providing government subsidies to CSA farms, after conducting a Contingent Valuation (CV) survey. The CV survey is designed to understand how much consumers {{are willing to pay for}} the different aspects of CSA, including the positive externalities that are not captured in the share prices. In particular, we find that CSA farms have potential to raise their share prices without losing sales and the U.

40|$|Rural {{tourism is}} {{considered}} an economic alternative for farmers who are facing sinking profits and require additional income. This in turn can lead to an entrepreneurial response. The distinction between simple diversification and entrepreneurship takes place when separate legal entities for new ventures are formed. Entrepreneurship is commonly defined as creating something of value from practically nothing (Timmons in Morrison, Rimmington and Williams 1999 : 10). It {{is the process of}} creating or seizing an opportunity, and pursuing it regardless of the resources currently personally controlled. This involves the definition, creation and distribution of value and benefits to individuals. In New Zealand’s modern history, the main factor supporting rural development was how a well educated rural population reacted to the withdrawal of farm subsidies in the mid 1980 s.
