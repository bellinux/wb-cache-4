5|$|The Northern Epirote {{representatives in}} the {{following}} Panepirotic Assembly of Delvino {{had to take the}} final decision on whether to accept the Protocol. The Protocol was eventually accepted after the intervention of Venizelos; however the representatives of Himara found the terms too humiliating, arguing that the only viable <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> be union with Greece and not autonomy inside the Albanian state.|$|E
5|$|After the convention, {{support for}} Nasjonal Samling, and Quisling {{personal}}ly, ebbed away. Increased factionalism and personal losses, including the accidental death of fellow politician Gulbrand Lunde, were compounded by heavy-handed German tactics, {{such as the}} shooting of ten well-known residents of Trøndelag and its environs in October 1942. In addition, the lex Eilifsen ex-post facto law of August 1943, {{which led to the}} first death sentence passed by the regime, was widely seen as a blatant violation of the Constitution and a sign of Norway's increasing role in the Final <b>Solution,</b> <b>would</b> destroy everything the convention had achieved in terms of boosting party morale.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, Franken {{proposed}} a financial reform legislation {{amendment that would}} create a board to select which credit rating agency would evaluate a given security. Currently any company issuing a security may select the company that evaluates the security. The amendment was passed; however, the financial industry lobbied to have Franken's amendment removed from the final bill. Negotiations between the Senate and House, whose version of financial reform did not include such a provision, resulted in the amendment's being watered down to require only {{a series of studies}} being done upon the issue for two years. After the studies, if the Securities and Exchange Commission has not implemented another solution to the conflict of interest problem, Franken's <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> go into effect.|$|E

5|$|The company Sotrasambandet AS {{has been}} {{established}} to lobby for and potentially debt-finance the construction, which potentially could include other parts of National Roads 555 and 561. In 2008, the company estimated {{that it might be}} possible to start construction in 2013, and complete the project by 2016. On 21 April 2009, State Secretary Geir Pollestad stated that the government would support a bridge, but did not indicate if a two-lane or four-lane <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> be chosen. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has recommended a four-lane bridge, while the Institute of Transport Economics has recommended the two-lane bridge. It is largely up to the city councils of Bergen and Fjell to determine which of the bridge alternatives will be chosen.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{widening}} the existing structure, the Minister for Transport, Eric Charlton, on 15 July 1998 approved {{the construction of}} a separate second road bridge alongside the original Narrows Bridge; this <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> cost $15 million less, due to new building techniques, and would be less disruptive to traffic on the existing bridge. The construction of a separate bridge was also deemed necessary because the foundations of any new structure might settle in the soft river bed at a different rate to the existing bridge. Under the plan, there would be six lanes on each bridge, including a bus lane on each. The new bridge would run parallel to the original bridge and be separated from it by a gap of , and was designed to look largely the same as the original.|$|E
5|$|After {{agreeing on}} an initial idea, Bushnell and Dabney {{began trying to}} design a {{prototype}} based on a Data General Nova. Initially {{they were joined by}} Larry Bryan, a computer programmer who also worked at Ampex. Bushnell and Dabney put US$100 each into a partnership, named Syzygy by Bryan. They soon ran into difficulties with their planned design; the computer was not powerful enough to refresh the monitors as fast as was needed to make the game playable. Bryan realized this early on, when trying to design the code needed to run the games, and left the project before Syzygy was formed without ever contributing any money, but Bushnell and Dabney continued working on the design for several more months. The pair attempted to reduce the load on the computer by replacing subroutines—such as displaying the background stars—with specialized hardware, but it proved insufficient; even reducing the number of monitors was not enough. By the end of November 1970, Bushnell decided to abandon the project as untenable, while Dabney had stopped working on the design a while before. It is unclear if the pair were aware that Data General had demonstrated a more powerful variant of the Nova, sold for US$8,000, running a single game of Spacewar at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in December 1968, though that <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> have been too expensive for an arcade game, which typically cost US$1,000 at the time. Unable to put the game idea out of his mind, however, Bushnell soon thought of a way to manipulate the video signal on the screen without a computer controlling it, and from there Syzygy {{came up with the idea}} of removing the computer altogether and building specialized hardware to handle everything for the game instead.|$|E
50|$|According to Von Beckerath, with date C, {{for reasons}} of space, the regnal year {{could only have been}} {{relatively}} low. Acceptable <b>solutions</b> <b>would</b> be: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11 or 20.|$|R

25|$|The {{most direct}} <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> {{be to try}} all {{permutations}} (ordered combinations) and see which one is cheapest (using brute force search).

25|$|Another {{possible}} {{long term}} <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> be to increase {{access to health}} facilities to rural parts of the world.

25|$|On April 28, 1937, Carothers {{went to the}} Experimental Station to work. He {{committed}} suicide {{in a hotel room}} in Philadelphia the next day by taking cyanide dissolved in lemon juice, knowing that the ingestion of cyanide in an acidic <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> greatly intensify the speed and effect of the poison.

25|$|Evaluations {{of various}} types of foreign {{aircraft}} were conducted to find a replacement; however, it was determined in 1965 that the most economical <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> be to re-engineer the existing aircraft with a modern turboprop engine. Accordingly, work began {{under the direction of}} Jean-Pierre Weibel to convert the 102nd C-3603 into the prototype C-3605.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, {{a simpler}} <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> be to consult an almanac giving {{the time of}} sunrise and sundown, {{calculate}} the middle point of that time-span, corresponding to the maximum elevation of the sun. This gives the official time at which the sun reaches it maximum elevation, and therefore the time the sun disk crosses the Saint-Sulpice meridian.|$|E
25|$|The {{scale of}} traffic growth envisaged would soon {{overtake}} any benefits that small-scale road improvement would offer, which would anyway {{divert attention from}} the large-scale <b>solutions</b> that <b>would</b> be needed. These <b>solutions</b> <b>would</b> be very expensive and could only be justified if they were comprehensively planned, including social as well as traffic needs. However, the report saw no turning back from people's new-found dependence on the car, and thought {{that there would be}} limits to how much traffic could be transferred to railways and buses.|$|R
30|$|In this section, we obtain {{sufficient}} {{conditions for}} the oscillation of all solutions of Eq. (1.1).

40|$|AbstractWe prove {{boundary}} asymptotics to solutions of weighted p-Laplacian equations {{that take}} infinite {{value on the}} boundary of a bounded domain.

25|$|Certain {{difference}} equations - in particular, linear {{constant coefficient}} difference equations - {{can be solved}} using z-transforms. The z-transforms are a class of integral transforms that lead to more convenient algebraic manipulations and more straightforward solutions. There are cases in which obtaining a direct <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> be all but impossible, yet solving the problem via a thoughtfully chosen integral transform is straightforward.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{the results}} {{presented}} by Mast et al. {{strongly suggest that}} Banksia is paraphyletic with respect to Dryandra. Although they did not propose a new taxonomic arrangement, they did consider various options for adjusting the current accepted arrangement to remove the paraphyly. They conclude that the simplest and least disruptive <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> be to merge Dryandra into Banksia. This solution was put into effect in a subsequent paper by Mast & Thiele.|$|E
25|$|The gravity cell {{consisted}} of a glass jar, in which a copper cathode sat {{on the bottom and}} a zinc anode was suspended beneath the rim. Copper sulfate crystals would be scattered around the cathode and then the jar would be filled with distilled water. As the current was drawn, a layer of zinc sulfate <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> form at the top around the anode. This top layer was kept separate from the bottom copper sulfate layer by its lower density and by the polarity of the cell.|$|E

30|$|In this section, we obtain {{sufficient}} {{conditions for}} the oscillation of all solutions of Eq. (1.1).

50|$|A {{necessary}} and sufficient condition for a polynomial Diophantine equation {{to have a}} solution is for c to be a multiple of the GCD of a and b. In the example above, the GCD of a and b was 1, so <b>solutions</b> <b>would</b> exist for any value of c.|$|R
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of nuclei in a <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> belong to the solvent, and most regular solvents are hydrocarbons and would contain NMR-reactive protons. Thus, deuterium (hydrogen-2) is substituted (99+%). The most used deuterated solvent is deuterochloroform (CDCl3), although deuterium oxide (D2O) and deuterated DMSO (DMSO-d6) are used for hydrophilic analytes and deuterated benzene is also common. The chemical shifts are slightly different in different solvents, depending on electronic solvation effects. NMR spectra are often calibrated against the known solvent residual proton peak instead of added tetramethylsilane.|$|E
25|$|Creativity-relevant skills (ability to {{concentrate}} on a problem {{for long periods of}} time, to abandon unproductive searches, and to temporarily put aside stubborn problems). The ability to put aside stubborn problems is referred to by Jex & Britt as productive forgetting. Creativity-relevant skills also require the individual contributor to evaluate a problem from multiple vantage points. One must be able to take on the perspective of various users. For example, an Operation Manager analyzing a reporting issue and developing an innovative <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> consider the perspective of a sales person, assistant, finance, compensation, and compliance officer.|$|E
25|$|During a {{demonstration}} of the E.28/39 to Winston Churchill in April 1943, Whittle proposed to Stafford Cripps, Minister of Aircraft Production, that all jet development be nationalised. He pointed out that the company had been funded by private investors who helped develop the engine successfully, only to see production contracts go to other companies. Nationalisation {{was the only way to}} repay those debts and ensure a fair deal for everyone, and he was willing to surrender his shares in Power Jets to make this happen. In October, Cripps told Whittle that he decided a better <b>solution</b> <b>would</b> be to nationalise Power Jets only.|$|E
30|$|As {{previously}} analyzed, the state-of-the-art preemptive {{solutions are}} insensitive to performance degradation due to {{reasons other than}} mobility, such as interference and congestion.
