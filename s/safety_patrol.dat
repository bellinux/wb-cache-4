500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought the episode displayed The Simpsons [...] "at its best – not only hilarious but daringly outspoken on {{a whole range of}} issues – the failures of the education system, police abuses of power, the stifling of children's creativity." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said [...] "Separate Vocations" [...] represent The Simpsons [...] "at its apex as a well tuned talent machine grinding out the good stuff with surprising accuracy and skill." [...] Gibron added that the episode shows that [...] "even in territory they're not used to (Bart as a <b>safety</b> <b>patrol,</b> Lisa as a cursing class cut up), the Simpsons' kids are funny and inventive." [...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a four out of five rating and commented that the script's [...] "departure from the traditional roles assigned to Bart and Lisa makes for a fresh experience with many laughs." [...] Meyers thought the highlight of the episode was Bart's ride in the police car.

500|$|The mountainous {{terrain of}} the {{peninsula}} and its numerous caverns, canyons, and valleys result in the area being of high interest to both visitors and researchers. There are several coves along the shore that have been named {{in order to identify}} them easily. Upon entering the park from the east, the first and easternmost beach available to the public is known as İçmeler Cove (...) [...] This cove's waters are shallower than any other in the park, and its beaches are sandy, unlike some of the coves farther out. Therefore, it appears to be more popular amongst tourists than most of the remaining beaches and parts of Kuşadası that are visible along the horizon from it. Aydınlık Cove is situated about [...] further to the west, and has pebbly shores and deeper waters. It marks the transition point where the waters {{of the peninsula}}'s beaches become more challenging. As a result, these beaches tend to attract more experienced swimmers and locals rather than tourists. After passing the jandarma (public <b>safety</b> <b>patrol)</b> checkpoint, a turn onto a road leads to a nearby canyon, immediately to the left. From this point on, there are several trails through the forests of the peninsula. One of them leads to the village of Doğanbey, and if followed further, leads to the nearby ancient Hellenistic port city of Karine. However, this path's final [...] are limited in access, and a permit or an accompanying tour guide is required to proceed.

At {{the very end of the}} peninsula appears its tallest mountain, Mycale (...) , which looms over Samos and the strait of its namesake.|$|E
