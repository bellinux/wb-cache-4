40|$|This project {{focuses on}} the use of {{splicing}} precast concrete beams to extend their span length. Precast prestressed concrete beams are economical solutions for many bridges, due to various restrictions such as weight and hauling length they are rarely used for spans greater than 40 m. This project was initiated by collecting the information from internet and technical reports of some bridge projects that have used spliced beam system. The experimental work has been carried out on three beams of 2. 5 m span with different location of splice loaded to fail. The type of splice beam system used consisted of precast pretensioned beam joint together by post-tensioned method. The experimental results show the development at shear failures inclined the depth opposed with initial prediction to fail in flexure. Both spliced beam has achieved the ultimate load capacity. On the other hand, the actual load capacity for controlled beam was twice times higher than calculated. From this research, base on ultimate load failure, the spliced system applied for double spliced beam has succeeded to perform as calculated nominal beam. However, since the actual controlled beam perform better, and the splice beam fail unexpectedly in shear, the future research should focusing on the materials, location and type of <b>splice</b> <b>section</b> to improve the present research...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} and characterization of corrosion {{is one of}} the many challenges in the nondestructive inspection (NDI) of aging aircraft. A number of groups are pursuing ultrasonic techniques for the {{detection and}} evaluation of corrosion in such aluminum fuselage structures such as lap splices and tear straps [1]. Under the FAA-Aging Aircraft Research Program, Patton and Hsu [2 – 4] at Iowa State University have developed the capability to apply high resolution, water-coupled, focused-beam ultrasonic NDI to aircraft fuselage structures in a maintenance hangar environment. The method, known as the “Dripless Bubbler” technique, is a combination of focused-beam immersion ultrasonics with a portable ultrasonic scanner. With the Dripless Bubbler, B- and C-scan images of the aircraft fuselage may be acquired using both high frequency and low frequency immersion ultrasonics typically only reserved for the laboratory. In this paper, we present results on corrosion detection in the outer aluminum skin of a fuselage lap <b>splice</b> <b>section</b> using high frequency (15 MHz nominal center frequency) immersion ultrasonics, and compare these results against those obtained from collimated-beam X-ray attenuation measurements.

40|$|We present {{composite}} depth {{scales for}} the multiply cored intervals from Sites 1150 and 1151. These new depth scales place coeval strata recovered in cores from different holes {{at a single}} site into a common stratigraphic framework. At Site 1150, double coring between Holes 1150 A and 1150 B occurred over only a short interval between ~ 703 and 713 meters below seafloor (mbsf), but this is sufficient to tie the upper portion of the stratigraphic section cored in Hole 1150 A to the lower portion cored in Hole 1150 B. The upper ~ 100 m of the sedimentary section at Site 1151 was double cored with the advanced piston corer and partially cored with the rotary core barrel, resulting in the complete recovery of this interval. The composite depth scales were constructed using Splicer software to vertically adjust the relative depths of various cores from one hole to the depths from another hole so as to align distinct physical properties measured on cores. The magnetic susceptibility data was the physical property most easily correlated between holes, and therefore primarily {{used to create a}} composite depth scale and <b>spliced</b> stratigraphic <b>section.</b> The <b>spliced</b> <b>section</b> is a continuous stratigraphic section constructed from representative cored intervals from the holes at a site.

40|$|Nick Shackleton’s {{research}} on piston cores from the Iberian margin highlighted {{the importance of}} this region for providing high-fidelity records of millennial-scale climate variability, and for correlating climate events from the marine environment to polar ice cores and European terrestrial sequences. During the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 339, we sought to extend the Iberian margin sediment record by drilling with the D/V JOIDES Resolution. Five holes were cored at Site U 1385 using the advanced piston corer (APC) system to a maximum depth of ∼ 155. 9 m below sea floor (m b. s. f.). Immediately after the expedition, cores from all holes were analyzed by core scanning X-ray fluorescence (XRF) at 1 cm spatial resolution. Ca/Ti data were used to accurately correlate from hole-to-hole and construct a composite <b>spliced</b> <b>section,</b> containing no gaps or disturbed intervals to 166. 5 m composite depth (mcd). A low-resolution (20 cm sample spacing) oxygen isotope record confirms that Site U 1385 contains a continuous record of hemipelagic sedimentation from the Holocene to 1. 43 Ma (Marine Isotope Stage 46). The sediment profile at Site U 1385 extends across the middle Pleistocene transition (MPT) with sedimentation rates averaging ∼ 10 cm kyr− 1. Strongprecession cycles in colour and elemental XRF signals provide a powerful tool for developing an orbitally tuned reference timescale.
