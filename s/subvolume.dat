40|$|The thermal {{discrete}} dipole approximation (T-DDA) is {{a numerical}} approach for modeling near-field {{radiative heat transfer}} in complex three-dimensional geometries. In this work, the convergence of the T-DDA is investigated by comparison against the exact results for two spheres separated by a vacuum gap. The error associated with the T-DDA is reported for various sphere sizes, refractive indices and vacuum gap thicknesses. The results reveal that for a fixed number of <b>subvolumes,</b> {{the accuracy of the}} T-DDA degrades as the refractive index and the sphere diameter to gap ratio increase. A converging trend is observed as the number of <b>subvolumes</b> increases. The large computational requirements associated with increasing the number of <b>subvolumes,</b> and the shape error induced by large sphere diameter to gap ratios, are mitigated by using a nonuniform discretization scheme. Nonuniform discretization is shown to significantly accelerate the convergence of the T-DDA, and is thus recommended for near-field thermal radiation simulations. Errors less than 5 % are obtained in 74 % of the cases studied by using up to 82712 <b>subvolumes.</b> Additionally, the convergence analysis demonstrates that the T-DDA is very accurate when dealing with surface polariton resonant modes dominating radiative heat transfer in the near field.

In SMP systems multiple CPUs can write to different AGs, enabling physically concurrent disk operations on a single file system. (Hard disks can only do one thing at a time.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the impact of the severity of ischemia on malignant edema formation, we investigated various degrees of perfusional deficit by (11) C-flumazenil PET in patients with large middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction. 17 patients with large MCA stroke were included. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured 15. 9 ± 6. 4 h after the ictus. Patients were divided into a malignant (n = 9) and a benign group (n = 8) as a function of their clinical courses and edema. Edema was measured as maximal midline shift on follow-up CTs. Total hypoperfusion volume was divided into different <b>subvolumes</b> according to the degree of CBF reduction. <b>Subvolumes</b> of severe ischemia relative to total ischemic area were significantly larger in the malignant group than in the benign group and were significantly correlated with edema formation. The highest correlation and best predictive values for edema formation with a sensitivity, specificity, and a positive and negative predictive value of 100 % were found for <b>subvolumes</b> with severe ischemia. Correlation coefficients and prediction decreased for <b>subvolumes</b> with less severe perfusional deficit, pointing to the risk of misclassifying patients when relying on the volume of total perfusional deficit alone. Malignant MCA infarction seems to be determined more by the volume of severe perfusional deficit than that of total perfusional deficit.

Accurate identification will allow simultaneous integrated boost to these <b>subvolumes</b> at higher risk to improve clinical outcomes. Methods—Twenty patients with esophageal cancer were treated with CRT plus surgery and underwent FDG PET/CT scans before and after CRT. The two scans were rigidly registered. Seven MAVs pre-CRT and four MAVs post-CRT within a tumor were defined with various SUV thresholds. The similarity and proximity between the MAVs pre-CRT and post-CRT were quantified with three metrics: fraction of post-CRT MAV included in pre-CRT MAV, volume overlap and centroid distance. Results—Eight patients had no residual MAV. Six patients had local residual MAV (SUV ≥ 2. 5 post-CRT) within or adjoining the original MAV (SUV ≥ 2. 5 pre-CRT).

40|$|International audienceThe {{high rates}} of failure in the {{radiotherapy}} target volume suggest that patients with stage II or III {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) should receive an increased total dose of radiotherapy. Areas of high (18) F-FDG uptake on preradiotherapy (18) F-FDG PET/CT have been reported to identify intratumor <b>subvolumes</b> at high risk of relapse after radiotherapy. We wanted to confirm these observations on a cohort of patients included in 3 sequential prospective studies. Our aim was to assess an appropriate threshold (percentage of maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax]) to delineate <b>subvolumes</b> on staging (18) F-FDG PET/CT scans assuming that a smaller target volume would facilitate isotoxic radiotherapy dose escalation. Thirty-nine patients with inoperable stage II or III NSCLC, treated with chemoradiation or with radiotherapy alone, were extracted from 3 prospective studies (ClinicalTrials. gov identifiers NCT 01261585, NCT 01261598, and RECF 0645). All patients underwent (18) F-FDG PET/CT at initial staging, before radiotherapy, during radiotherapy, and during systematic follow-up in a single institution.

Various <b>subvolumes</b> in the initial acquisition (30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 80 %, and 90 % SUVmax thresholds) and in the 3 subsequent acquisitions (40 % and 90 % SUVmax thresholds) were pasted on the initial scan and compared. Seventeen patients had a local relapse. The SUVmax measured during radiotherapy was significantly higher in locally relapsed tumors than in locally controlled tumors (mean, 6. 8 vs. 4. 6; P = 0. 02). The <b>subvolumes</b> delineated on initial PET/CT scans with 70 %- 90 % SUVmax thresholds were in good agreement with the recurrent volume at a 40 % SUVmax threshold (common volume/baseline volume, 0. 60 - 0. 80).

The agreement was moderate (> 0. 51) when a 70 % SUVmax threshold was used to delineate on initial PET/CT scans.

Our aim was to confirm these observations in patients with LAOC and to determine the optimal maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) threshold to delineate smaller RT target volumes that would facilitate RT dose escalation without impaired tolerance. The study included 98 consecutive patients with LAOC treated by chemoradiotherapy (CRT). All patients underwent FDG PET/CT at initial staging and during systematic follow-up in a single institution. FDG PET/CT acquisitions were coregistered on the initial CT scan. Various <b>subvolumes</b> within the initial tumour (30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90  % SUVmax thresholds) and in the subsequent local recurrence (LR, 40 and 90  % SUVmax thresholds) were pasted on the initial CT scan and compared[Dice, Jaccard, overlap fraction (OF), common volume/baseline volume, common volume/recurrent volume]. Thirty-five patients had LR. The initial metabolic tumour volume was significantly higher in LR tumours than in the locally controlled tumours (mean 25. 4 vs 14. 2  cc; p[*]=[*] 0. 002).

This builds on the study of Heyes, Dini, and Smith [J. Chem. Phys. 145, 104504 (2016) ] which only considered the VA method for larger <b>subvolumes.</b> The focus here is typically on much smaller <b>subvolumes</b> than considered previously, which tend to the Irving-Kirkwood limit where the pressure tensor is defined at a point. The PDFs from the MOP and VA routes are compared for cubic <b>subvolumes,</b> V=ℓ 3. Using very high grid-resolution and box-counting analysis, we also show that any measurement of pressure in a molecular system will fail to exactly capture the molecular configuration. This suggests that it is impossible to obtain the pressure in the Irving-Kirkwood limit using the commonly employed grid based averaging techniques. More importantly, below ℓ≈ 3 in LJ reduced units, the PDFs depart from Gaussian statistics, and for ℓ= 1. 0, a double peaked PDF is observed in the MOP but not VA pressure distributions. This departure from a Gaussian shape means that the average pressure is not the most representative or common value to arise.
