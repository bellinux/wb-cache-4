40|$|We {{report on}} the design and first tests of a device {{allowing}} for measurement of ultracold neutrons polarisation {{by means of the}} simultaneous analysis of the two spin components. The device was developed in the framework of the neutron electric dipole moment experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute. Individual parts and the entire newly built system have been characterised with ultracold neutrons. The gain in statistical sensitivity obtained with the simultaneous spin analyser is (18. 2 ± 6. 1) % relative to the former <b>sequential</b> <b>analyser</b> under nominal running conditions...|$|E
40|$|The Fisher Hem-Alyzer is a multitest <b>sequential</b> {{discrete}} <b>analyser</b> {{with automatic}} printout of digitized results on paper tape. The instrument is well designed, soundly constructed, and reliable in routine use. Cross contamination from the sampler probe or between the cuvettes is minimal. Accuracy and precision are both highly satisfactory. Although the standard rate of throughput is 32 specimens per hour the instrument {{can be used}} at irregular intervals to analyse smaller batches or even individual specimens. In a routine daily service the Hem-Alyzer was capable of handling a workload of 200 specimens per day, requiring three hours of laboratory technician time. The Hem-Alyzer produces only three parameters. By not determining the packed cell volume {{it is not possible}} to incorporate the derived indices (MCV and MCHC) into the system and this, in the long term, is bound to be a disadvantage...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{and process}} control {{applications}} have needs for sensors that operate continuously or repeatedly, making them applicable to batch measurement and flowing product stream measurement. Additionally, for lactose monitoring in dairy-processing plants, the sensors must have sufficient flexibility {{to handle a}} wide range of substrate concentration and be resilient to withstand wide pH excursions brought about by frequent exposure to clean-in-place chemicals that happen without any warning. This paper describes the development and trialling of an at-line lactose biosensor that meets the needs of the dairy industry for loss monitoring of lactose in dairy-processing plants by the combination of a third-generation enzyme biosensor with a <b>sequential</b> injection <b>analyser.</b> Results, both from grab sample analysis and an at-line factory prototype, are shown from their operation when installed at a Fonterra dairy factory (New Zealand) during the 2011 - 2012 season. Previous sensor fabrication methods were converted to a single-step process, and the flow-through cell was adapted to bubble-free operation. The lactose concentration in wastewater-processing streams was successfully monitored by taking and analysing samples every 2 - 3 min, semi-continuously, for 3 months by an unskilled operator. The Fonterra site flushes approximately 100 - 300, 000 L of wastewater per hour from its lactose plant. In the 2011 - 2012 season, the daily mean lactose content of this wastewater varied significantly, from 0. 0 to 8. 0 % w/v (0 - 233, 712 mu M) and equated to substantial total losses of lactose over a 6 -month period. These lactose losses represent lost saleable or useable product...|$|R

Introduction: In Africa, it is {{estimated}} that cardiovascular disease (CVD) will affect approximately 1. 3 million people per annum over the following 20 years. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a predictor of CVD risk and certain CRP gene polymorphisms can result in altered CRP concentrations. The distribution of CRP gene polymorphisms is ethnic-specific and extrapolating information from other populations to the black South African population, reported to harbour considerable genetic variation, should be avoided. This highlights the fact that genetic research among black South Africans is necessary. Objectives: The main aim of this dissertation was to determine the association between various polymorphisms (reported and novel [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ] within the CRP gene with CRP concentrations [measured as high sensitivity (hs) -CRP concentrations] in a black South African population undergoing an epidemiological transition. Interactions between specific CRP polymorphisms and certain environmental factors on hs-CRP concentrations were also investigated. Methods: This cross-sectional study (n= 1, 588) was nested within the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study. Genotyping was performed using Illumina VeraCode technology on the BeadXpress® platform. Hs-CRP concentrations were measured by the use of a <b>sequential</b> multiple <b>analyser</b> computer (SMAC) through a particle-enhanced immunoturbidometric assay. Results: All the SNPs adhered to the assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, although the distribution of several SNPs differed from that reported in other population groups. Three SNPs (rs 3093058, rs 3093062 and rs 3093068) were associated with a significant (p ≤ 0. 05) increase in CRP concentrations. Five SNPs (rs 1205, rs 1341665, rs 2794520, rs 7553007 and rs 2027471) were associated with a significant (p ≤ 0. 05) decrease in CRP concentrations. This difference in effect was most probably due to changes in gene function brought about by the localisation of these SNPs in the CRP gene. Men and urban individuals were more likely to present with significant associations between the SNPs investigated and CRP concentrations. The difference in the prevalence of the alleles associated with higher CRP concentrations in this population compared to non-African populations could possibly explain the increased CRP concentrations that are observed in the black South African population. Gene-gender (rs 1205, rs 1341665 and rs 2027474) as well as gene-environmental (rs 3093068) interactions were also observed. Conclusions: CRP concentrations are in themselves a complex trait and there are many factors at play that influence their expression. Numerous factors (both genetic and environmental) are involved and no single factor acting alone is likely to have enough of an influence {{to be used as a}} clinical diagnostic test of CRP concentrations. These results provide valuable information on the regulation of CRP in a black South African population as well as contribute to the literature of CRP on a global level. Master...|$|R
