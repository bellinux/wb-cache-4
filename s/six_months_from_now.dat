Jackson attempted several new musical styles; lyrically exploring her sexuality more explicitly and freely. A central theme of split personalities is incorporated within the content of several songs. Jackson stated [...] "It shows the different sides of me, the different characters that I feel that I display at different moments in my life" [...] "I am divulging myself a little more on this album, and it's definitely much more intimate. That's another side of myself that people have seen, but not to this level."

An adaptive team has difficulty describing exactly what will happen in the future. The further away a date is, the more vague an adaptive method is about what will happen on that date. An adaptive team cannot report exactly what tasks they will do next week, but only which features they plan for next month.

He has also said that in general, 'You have to keep a certain emotional distance from the events in front of you; otherwise {{it would be impossible to}} report objectively. You can care deeply about whom or what you are covering, but you must not let your feelings cloud your judgement or prevent you from being an independent observer. On controversial topics, you have to play devil's advocate and ask people direct and often difficult questions'.|$|E

50|$|Extending {{from the}} {{research}} on executive functioning, delay discounting {{is defined as the}} extent to which a person prefers an immediate reward of less value compared to a delayed reward of more value. The task that is used to measure delay discounting is a behavioral decision-making task in which people are asked to choose between an immediate reward of less value (e.g., $400 today) and a variety of delayed rewards of more value (e.g., $700 1 month from now or $800 <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>from</b> <b>now).</b> How well someone performs on this task has been linked to development of brain regions, specifically the pre-frontal lobe, that are responsible for a person's reactions to rewards and punishments, and resistance to impulses. Delay discounting is used as a measure of future orientation because people need to be able to be motivated to work and plan in the present to receive the reward or reach their goal. It also provides a behavioral and neurological basis for future orientation.|$|E
5000|$|As {{part of an}} {{investigation}} of illicit drug traffic conducted by the Oklahoma legislature, representative Robert Cunningham seized Marshall's files. During an initial hearing, Marshall insisted {{that he was a}} doctor, refusing to answer further statements. Marshall gave Cunningham a list of his patients, including Hank Williams. Defending his position, he claimed that Williams possibly committed suicide. Marshall stated that Williams told him that he had decided to [...] "destroy the Hank Williams that was making the money they were getting". He attributed the decision to Williams' declining career: [...] "Most of his bookings were of the honky-tonk beer joint variety that he simply hated. If he came to this conclusion (of suicide), he still had enough prestige left as a star to make a first-class production of it ... whereas, <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> unless he pulled himself back up into some high-class bookings, he might have been playing for nickels and dimes on skid row." ...|$|E

British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden wrote in his diary that [...] "A difficulty is that the Americans are terrified of the subject which advisor Harry Hopkins called 'political dynamite' for their elections.

40|$|We {{examine a}} {{conditional}} scheduling {{model in which}} the deadlines of jobs are allowed to vary. We explore variants of the basic model and locate the dividing line between NP-hard and polynomial-time problems. Suppose that an engineer needs to design one of two devices, either A or B. Each device will require nine months of work. The due date of both A and B is in one year, but only one device {{will need to be}} completed. However, which device will need to be built will not be known until <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b> Building both devices is clearly impossible, since the total amount of time required is 18 months. Instead, the engineer’s next six months should be divided between A and B, with the remaining six months devoted exclusively to one or the other, depending on the decision <b>six</b> <b>months</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> about which device to complete. In this example, the scheduling strategy is easy enough to determine. In more complicated examples, it may be less clear how to devise a strategy. What if the devices to be made are many, require unequal amounts of time, and have unequal due dates? What if the decisions about which device to make occur at different times? What if some devices require other devices to be already completed? This report presents generalizations and variants of the engineer’s problem, and locates the dividing line between polynomial-time and computationally infeasibl...|$|E
30|$|A forty-six {{year old}} patient with {{diagnosis}} of Rokitanski syndrome (two rudimentary hemiuterus with normal ovaries were discovered by laparoscopy at age 16 because of primary amenorrhea) {{is seen in}} our department because of chronic pelvic pain. The patient has led a normal life with normal sex intercourses. An MRI showed an image compatible with hematometra in the left vestige utero. <b>Six</b> <b>months</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> the patient underwent laparoscopy for suspected GIST tumors, but multiple fibroids were found and no evidence of tumor. Given the findings, the patient was referred to our clinic. We decided to perform a new laparoscopy for resection of both uterine fibroid remains. The surgery takes place without incident, in which normal ovaries are observed and uterine fibroid vestiges are removed. There is no communication between the uterine vestiges and the vagina or in between.|$|E
