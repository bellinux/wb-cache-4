40|$|The {{monitoring}} {{and interpretation of}} respiration pattern {{plays an important role}} for the early detection and the prevention of serious illness, such as asthma, sleeping apnea, bronchitis, and lung cancer. In this interdisciplinary project a system based on a smart shirt with integrated textile sensor for personal respiratory monitoring was developed. Due to the fact that textile products are flexible, washable and bring no discomfort to wearers, the smart shirtis an excellent interface for performing long term respiratory monitoring in real life situations outside the clinic. Two stripe liked sensors located on the chest and abdomen position respectively were integrated in a smart shirt. The sensors were made by coating with conductive silicone on the fabric surface of the smart shirt. Conductive silicone reflects compression or extension by resistance change and in this application resistance change can be utilized to indicate the respiratory pattern of the wearer. A prototype system was made to record the resistance change in real time and transmission to a PC or PDA for further processing. <b>Snap</b> <b>button</b> and conductive threads were used as the interface and transmission wires between the smart shirt and the recording system. To verify the performance, test were made with 10 subjects, whose spontaneous respiratory patterns were recorded during sitting still, walking and jogging. In addition, a number of abnormal respiratory conditions, such as deep breathing, hyperventilation and sleeping apnea were simulated. The results show the smart shirt performed in a very good manner, the system can sense and record the person's breathing during normal daily activities. The sleeping apnea simulation indicates potential application in diagnosis and clinical treatment. The smart shirt is soft and comfortable to use and enables long-term monitoring to be performed outside the laboratory...|$|E

40|$|Abstract NetBytes Host Viewer is an {{interactive}} visualization tool designed {{to show the}} historical network flow data per port of an individual host machine or subnet on a network over time, using a 3 D impulse graph plot. Such visualizations allow network administrators to quickly and effectively diagnose infected or malfunctioning computers by viewing data transmission patterns for each port on the entity. NetBytes has a set of interactive features which help {{to deal with the}} problems associated with displaying a 3 D graph on a 2 D screen. First, NetBytes offers a “selector ” mode which allows the user to highlight specific ports (or times) on the graph using a slider and <b>snap</b> <b>buttons.</b> From the selector, the user can launch a set of 2 D graphs (Bytes vs. Time and Bytes vs. Ports) to acquire more detailed information about the host with less clutter. Lastly, the user is able to rotate the 3 D graph in any direction to mitigate occlusion. The long term objectives of this work include the integration of the NetBytes Viewer with complementary visualizations of the overall network. This application will integrate with a larger network analysis tool and be utilized as a drill-down mechanism. 1...|$|R
50|$|The M42 {{color was}} Olive Drab #3. The coat {{consisted}} of four front patch pockets with two <b>button</b> <b>snaps</b> on each, {{along with a}} unique dual-zippered knife pocket located on the upper lapel {{which was designed to}} contain a switchblade pocketknife. The trousers had four internal pockets and two large patch pockets located one on each thigh. The thigh pockets were also closed by two <b>button</b> <b>snaps</b> each. Due to the somewhat fragile nature of the uniform, however, the M42 was often reinforced with thicker, tougher canvas on the elbows, crotch and knees. The M42 was mostly worn by Paratroops assigned to Airborne units. The M42 was eventually phased out in favor of the new M-1943 Uniform which was a darker green, OD #7. Despite this, various individuals chose to keep their M42s in order to show their veteran status.|$|R

40|$|Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a {{progressive}} muscular disease. Active hand orthoses can greatly {{improve the quality}} of life of people with DMD. Surface Electromyography (sEMG) is commonly used for the control of active devices. The interfacing between the human and the sensor is regularly done by an adhesive skin interface (sticker). This can cause discomfort, especially during daily use. For forearm sEMG measurements, a sleeve design can solve this problem. The design presented here aims to make sEMG more comfortable, yet functional for daily use. In order to achieve that, we designed a simple, low-cost sEMG sleeve using a commercial ankle brace. 6 equidistant cuts around the circumference of the sleeve were made in order for the sEMG sensors (Delsys Trigno, Delsys Inc.) to be placed. Those are held in place by a number of 3 D printed plastic casings mounted with plastic <b>snap</b> <b>buttons.</b> The buttons are used to make the attachment of the casings fast and easy. A preliminary evaluation of the sleeve has been carried out with 6 healthy subjects, using a library of 6 and 9 gestures and a simple artificial neural network (ANN) classifier. The performance was evaluated, in terms of classification time, training time and accuracy (offline) and selection time, completion time, completion rate and accuracy (online). The results show that the performance of the sleeve is not significantly different than the adhesive skin interface. We conclude, that the EMG-sleeve is a better alternative than the current methods for sensor skin interfacing, while having similar performance during a classification task...|$|R
50|$|A placket (also spelled placquet) is {{an opening}} in the upper part of {{trousers}} or skirts, or at the neck or sleeve of a garment.

50|$|A Senninbari (thousand-person-stitches) or One-thousand stitch is a {{strip of}} cloth that {{measures}} approximately 6 inches high and up to 3 or 4 feet or more in length.

Other variations were never worn but may have been folded and placed inside helmet liners, pockets or packs. Senninbari were decorated with 1000 knots or stitches, and each stitch was normally made by a different woman. Senninbari were given as an amulet by women to soldiers on their way to war as a part of the Shinto culture of Imperial Japan.|$|R
