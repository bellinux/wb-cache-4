5|$|During this process, the Home Office {{declined}} to give Bamber the expert evidence it had obtained, so Bamber applied for judicial review of that decision in November 1994; this resulted in the Home Office handing over its expert evidence. In 1996, without informing Bamber or his lawyers, an Essex police officer destroyed many of the trial exhibits. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been aware that the case was ongoing.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Altgens testified for the Warren Commission and {{was asked}} about the gunfire and whether he knew its source. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been keeping track of the number of gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza because he {{believed}} them to be fireworks, but he was certain of at least two. Altgens believed Kennedy's wounds suggested a final shot that came from the vicinity of the book depository building, but he could not say with any certainty.|$|E

Two decades later, Marshall University retired Gatski's number 72 during a homecoming game against the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Gatski was the first and remains the only Marshall football player to be so honored.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being a U.S. citizen, Lin is by descent through his parents a national of Taiwan; Lin would qualify for a Taiwan passport although there is no record of him having done so. Lin has been invited to play for the Chinese Taipei men's national basketball team in FIBA competitions. On July 28, 2010 while in Taipei to play in Yao Ming's charity game, Lin <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> made a decision yet on whether he would represent Chinese Taipei (the name used by Taiwan in international sporting competitions). In June 2011, the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association (CTBA) included Lin in its preliminary squad of 24 players for the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship. The next month, however, the CTBA announced that Lin would not be included on their roster due to a knee injury.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Ronald Koeman's departure, Portuguese media began to speculate about Benfica's next manager. They initially focused on Sven-Göran Eriksson, who had previously managed the club and was in Algarve preparing for the World Cup with England's national squad. On 17 May, Eriksson <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been approached to join Benfica. José Antonio Camacho's agent dismissed speculation about his return. On 19 May, SIC Notícias announced Carlos Queiroz had signed a two-year deal with Benfica. Both parties immediately denied any agreement; Queiroz {{said he did not}} intend to leave Manchester United. The following day, Benfica presented Fernando Santos as the club's new manager on a two-year contract. Santos had last managed in Portugal in 2003–04, when he led Sporting to a third-place finish, and previously spent three years at Porto, winning five major titles. He became the third manager—the first Portuguese—to manage all of the country's Big Three football clubs, after Otto Glória and Fernando Riera. He would be assisted by Fernando Chalana, who remained connected with the club's management; Jorge Rosário as his long-term technical assistant; Bruno Moura as physiotherapist and Ricardo Santos as scout of the opponents.|$|E

25|$|Article 301's old form before 2005 (and {{also the}} new form after the {{amendments}} in 2008) required that prosecution under the article {{needs to be}} approved by the Ministry of Justice. A few minutes after Pamuk's trial started on 16 December, the judge found that this approval had not yet been received and suspended the proceedings. In an interview published in the Akşam newspaper the same day, the then Justice Minister Cemil Çiçek <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet received Pamuk's file but would study it thoroughly once it came.|$|E

25|$|McDowell later {{reported}} by phone that the shooting had died down, and Hunter and the citizens' group were optimistic that a disaster would be avoided. They decided the National Guard troops were not needed after all. Hughes {{went to the}} mine with a white flag, but he never took it out or raised it. He later <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> seen McDowell raise a white flag, so he decided Lester's men had not {{lived up to the}} bargain. He went home and did nothing, later claiming he learned that his boss in the UMWA leadership, Hugh Willis, was now involved and decided his role was finished.|$|E
25|$|Clarett's time at Ohio State University {{was marked}} by several troubling incidents. He was seen yelling at his {{position}} coach during the Northwestern–Ohio State game in the 2002 season. In December 2002, he publicly maligned OSU officials for not paying for him to fly home for the funeral of a friend and accused administrators of lying when they <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> filed the necessary paperwork. In July 2003, Clarett {{became the center of}} an academic scandal when a teaching assistant told the New York Times that Clarett had received preferential treatment from professors, claiming he had not attended any classes during his only year at Ohio State. However, the investigation did not find sufficient evidence of academic misconduct.|$|E
25|$|The second Remington {{trial began}} in January 1953 with Judge Vincent L. Leibell presiding. It lasted only eight days. The jury found Remington guilty of two counts, for lying when he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> given secret {{information}} to Elizabeth Bentley {{and that he}} did not know of the existence of the Young Communist League, which had a chapter at Dartmouth while Remington was a student there. Leibell sentenced Remington to three years in prison. While his attorneys prepared another appeal, Remington began his sentence at Danbury Federal Correctional Institution where he became friends with fellow prisoner, nonviolent action theorist Gene Sharp, before being transferred to Lewisburg. The appeals court upheld the original verdict, and in February 1954, the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.|$|E

25|$|After his father's death, Welles {{traveled}} to Europe {{using a small}} portion of his inheritance. Welles said that while on a walking and painting trip through Ireland, he strode into the Gate Theatre in Dublin and claimed he was a Broadway star. The manager of Gate, Hilton Edwards, later <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> believed him but was impressed by his brashness and an impassioned audition he gave. Welles made his stage debut at the Gate Theatre on October 13, 1931, appearing in Ashley Dukes's adaptation of Jew Suss as Duke Karl Alexander of Württemberg. He performed small supporting roles in subsequent Gate productions, and he produced and designed productions of his own in Dublin. In March 1932 Welles performed in W. Somerset Maugham's The Circle at Dublin's Abbey Theatre and travelled to London to find additional work in the theatre. Unable to obtain a work permit, he returned to the U.S.|$|E
25|$|Perutz's {{justification}} for passing Franklin's {{report about the}} crystallographic unit of the B-DNA and A-DNA structures to both Crick and Watson was that the report contained information which Watson had heard before, in November 1951, when Franklin talked about her unpublished results with Raymond Gosling during a meeting arranged by M.H.F. Wilkins at King's College, following a request from Crick and Watson; Perutz <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> acted unethically because the report {{had been part of}} an effort to promote wider contact between different MRC research groups and was not confidential. This justification would exclude Crick, who was not present at the November 1951 meeting, yet Perutz also gave him access to Franklin's MRC report data. Crick and Watson then sought permission from Cavendish Laboratory head William Lawrence Bragg, to publish their double-helix molecular model of DNA based on data from Franklin and Wilkins.|$|E
25|$|Boyd's lack {{of first}} team {{appearances}} prompted the newly appointed Hartlepool manager Neale Cooper to loan him to Boston United to gain match practice. During {{his time at}} Boston, Boyd won critical acclaim from Boston manager Neil Thompson and played a total of 14 matches scoring four goals before returning to Hartlepool. Boyd returned nine pounds overweight and looked set to leave Hartlepool United after angering Cooper. When asked about his weight gain, Boyd claimed {{that he had been}} eating more to build up his strength but when asked about gym work he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> started it yet. Boston looked set to make permanent deal for Boyd and made an offer for the striker. However, both teams failed to reach an agreement with Boston claiming that Hartlepool were asking far too much. It was rumoured that Hartlepool chairman, Ken Hodcroft, wanted a five figure sum, but Boston were only prepared to pay a four figure amount of around £5,000.|$|E
