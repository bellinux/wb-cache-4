5|$|A {{pipe organ}} {{contains}} {{one or more}} sets of pipes, a wind system, and one or more keyboards. The pipes produce sound when pressurized air produced by the wind system passes through them. An action connects the keyboards to the pipes. Stops allow the organist to control which ranks of pipes <b>sound</b> <b>at</b> a given time. The organist operates the stops and the keyboards from the console.|$|E

5|$|Hammond organs have a {{built-in}} vibrato effect {{that provides a}} small variation in pitch while a note is being played, and a chorus effect where a note's sound is combined with another <b>sound</b> <b>at</b> a slightly different and varying pitch. The best known vibrato and chorus system consists of six settings, V1, V2, V3, C1, C2 and C3 (i.e., three each of vibrato and chorus), which can be selected via a rotary switch. Vibrato / chorus can be selected for each manual independently.|$|E
5|$|I Am Legend earned four {{nominations}} for the Visual Effects Society awards, {{and was also}} nominated for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, Outstanding Film and Actor at the Image Awards, and Best <b>Sound</b> <b>at</b> the Satellite Awards.

5|$|Motion City Soundtrack was an American {{rock band}} that formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1997. The band's line-up {{consisted}} of vocalist and guitarist Justin Pierre, lead guitarist Joshua Cain, keyboardist Jesse Johnson, bassist Matthew Taylor, and drummer Tony Thaxton. Over {{the course of}} their nearly twenty-year career, the group toured heavily and released six studio albums, the majority on independent label Epitaph Records. The band's <b>sound,</b> <b>at</b> times described as pop punk or emo, made notable use of the Moog synthesizer.|$|E
5|$|Ophelia moved {{extremely}} {{slowly in}} and around North Carolina, causing the storm to drop more than 10inches (254mm) of rain on many coastal areas. The highest amount measured was from Oak Island, where 17.5inches (445mm) was registered. In addition, storm surges of 7–12feet (2–4m) were recorded, particularly in low-lying inlets of Pamlico <b>Sound.</b> <b>At</b> the storm's peak, over 240,000 customers were without power in coastal North Carolina. One indirect fatality was reported due to a traffic accident related to Ophelia, although no direct deaths were recorded.|$|E

5|$|The Nord Stage {{follows the}} success of earlier {{keyboard}} instruments from Clavia, and contains similar emulations of vintage electromechanical keyboards such as the Hammond Organ and electric pianos as found on the Nord Electro 2, with additional functionality including a weighted piano-like keyboard on certain models, a synthesizer section based on the Nord Lead, a more versatile organ section and extended effects processing. The Nord Stage is multitimbral, which means it can play more than one <b>sound</b> <b>at</b> once, either by splitting the internal keyboard or connecting an external MIDI controller.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{chosen for}} nest holes have soft {{heartwood}} and tough sapwood, the former often due to parasites or diseases that weaken the tree's core. It {{is not certain}} how suitable trees are selected, {{although it may be}} by drumming, since woods with differing elastic modulus and density may transmit <b>sound</b> <b>at</b> different speeds. A Japanese study found nests in trees from many families; these included grey alder, Japanese white birch, Japanese hop-hornbeam, Japanese tree lilac, willows, Japanese larch and Sargent's cherry. The Mongolian oak and prickly castor-oil tree were rarely if ever used.|$|E
5|$|From the Greek {{word for}} pan pipes, σύριγξ, {{it is the}} vocal organ of birds. Located {{at the base of}} a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the vocal folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one <b>sound</b> <b>at</b> a time.|$|E

5|$|Grand Theft Auto: Vice City {{received}} multiple nominations {{and awards}} from gaming publications. It {{was named the}} Best PlayStation 2 game at the 1st British Academy Games Awards, the Golden Joystick Awards, and from Entertainment Weekly, IGN, and GameSpot. It was also awarded the prestigious Ultimate Game at the Golden Joystick Awards. The game was awarded Best Action/Adventure Game from the British Academy Games Awards, GameSpot, and IGN. The game's sound also received several awards and nominations: it won Best Music from GameSpot, and was nominated for Best Sound, and it won the award for <b>Sound</b> <b>at</b> the British Academy Games Awards. It won Design at the British Academy Games Awards and was nominated for Best Graphics (Technical and Artistic) by GameSpot. The game was the runner-up for IGN's Reader's Choice Overall Game of the Year and was nominated for GameSpot's award for Best Story. It was awarded Best PC Game at the British Academy Games Awards.|$|E
5|$|Hearing is {{important}} for a nocturnal bird of prey, and as with other owls, the tawny owl's two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences {{in the time of}} arrival of a <b>sound</b> <b>at</b> each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below. Both ear openings are hidden under the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable fold of skin (the pre-aural flap).|$|E
5|$|In {{the other}} naval theatres {{there were no}} decisive pitched battles. In the Black Sea, {{engagement}} between Russian and Turkish battleships was restricted to skirmishes. In the Baltic Sea, action was largely limited to the raiding of convoys, and the laying of defensive minefields; the only significant clash of battleship squadrons there was the Battle of Moon <b>Sound</b> <b>at</b> which one Russian pre-dreadnought was lost. The Adriatic was {{in a sense the}} mirror of the North Sea: the Austro-Hungarian dreadnought fleet remained bottled up by the British and French blockade. And in the Mediterranean, the most important use of battleships was in support of the amphibious assault on Gallipoli.|$|E

5|$|In tone clusters, {{the notes}} are sounded fully and in unison, {{distinguishing}} them from ornamented figures involving acciaccaturas and the like. Their effect {{also tends to}} be different: where ornamentation is used {{to draw attention to}} the harmony or the relationship between harmony and melody, tone clusters are for the most part employed as independent sounds. While, by definition, the notes that form a cluster must <b>sound</b> <b>at</b> the same time, there is no requirement that they must all begin sounding at the same moment. For example, in R. Murray Schafer's choral Epitaph for Moonlight (1968), a tone cluster is constructed by dividing each choir section (soprano/alto/tenor/bass) into four parts. Each of the sixteen parts enters separately, humming a note one semitone lower than the note hummed by the previous part, until all sixteen are contributing to the cluster.|$|E
5|$|Spoken For is {{the second}} studio album by Christian rock band MercyMe. Released on October 1, 2002, Spoken For sold 28,000 copies in its first week, debuting at number 41 on the Billboard 200; it also peaked at number two on the Christian Albums chart and number six on the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart. The album {{received}} a generally positive reception from critics, some of whom praised the album as being both a lyrical and musical progression from their debut album Almost There. Several critics also noted a shift in sound from Almost There, describing Spoken For as having a roots rock <b>sound.</b> <b>At</b> the 34th GMA Dove Awards, Spoken For was nominated for Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year; the album was certified Gold by the RIAA in October 2003.|$|E
5|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the New York City Subway {{produces}} {{high levels of}} noise that exceed guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2006, Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health found noise levels averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94dB on platforms. Daily exposure to noise at such levels {{for as little as}} 30 minutes can lead to hearing loss. Noise on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100dB. Under WHO and EPA guidelines, noise exposure at that level is limited to 1.5 minutes. A subsequent study by Columbia and the University of Washington found higher average noise levels in the subway (80.4dB) than on commuter trains including Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) (79.4dB), Metro-North (75.1dB) and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) (74.9dB). Since the decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, <b>sound</b> <b>at</b> 95dB is 10 times more intense than at 85dB, 100 times more intense than at 75dB, and so forth. In the second study, peak subway noise registered at 102.1dB.|$|E
