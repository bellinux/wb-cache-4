50|$|On this locomotive, the {{arrangement}} of the saddle-tank precluded the use of the usual steam dome on the boiler barrel. Instead, steam for the cylinders was collected by a perforated pipe, fitted to the combined regulator and <b>steam</b> collector <b>box,</b> which was arranged at the highest point in the steam space above the crown of the firebox.|$|R
50|$|The {{action of}} the {{superheater}} was simple. Upon opening of the regulator, saturated steam {{was admitted to the}} rear chamber of the right hand side <b>steam</b> collector <b>box,</b> from where it passed through the tubes to the left hand side box in a slightly superheated condition. From there it passed back to the front chamber of the right hand side box through {{the other half of the}} tubes, and then, in a superheated condition, to the cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The inner {{series of}} tubes were bent {{up at the}} ends and {{expanded}} into two cast-steel collector boxes, attached to the smokebox {{on each side of}} the chimney. The right hand side box was divided into two chambers by a central partition, with half the superheater tubes expanding into each of the chambers. The partition on the tube plate side of this box was connected to the regulator pipe, while the front partition was connected through the steam pipes to the cylinders. The left hand side <b>steam</b> collector <b>box</b> had no partition.|$|R

The unit is based on Xi3's [...] "performance level" [...] X7A model and is slightly larger than a human hand, containing various I/O ports to connect to power, video, and data signals. Xi3 began taking pre-orders for the Piston Console at the 2013 South by Southwest Festival in March 2013, anticipating high levels of interest in the hardware with plans to release the unit for general purchase by the end of 2013. Valve has clarified that although they conducted some initial exploratory work with Xi3, they have had no direct involvement with the Piston's specifications, and it is not necessarily representative of the final design for the <b>Steam</b> <b>Box.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{line between}} Plymstock and Yealmpton {{was at first}} worked as a single section by {{electric}} train staff. Plymstock was a LSWR signalbox. Brixton Road later had a signal box, from 1905, breaking the branch into two sections, but it was closed in 1924 or 1925. When the passenger service was withdrawn in 1930, the signalling was converted to one engine in <b>steam</b> and Yealmpton <b>box</b> was abolished.|$|R
50|$|These {{locomotives}} {{were the}} first engines {{to be built in}} Britain with a Schmidt superheater, which was of the smokebox type and consisted of 61 solid drawn-steel tubes. The superheater tubes were encased in a box which was built up of thin steel plates, adapted to the shape of the outer series of tubes, and ended at the <b>steam</b> collector <b>box</b> in two narrow vertical dampers. The whole superheater occupied two-thirds of the total length of the smokebox. To ensure that the superheater tubes received ample heat, a large flue of 10+3/4 in diameter was installed in {{the lower part of the}} boiler between the firebox and the front tube plate, where it connected to the casing of the superheater.|$|R
5000|$|The {{comparatively}} low {{boiler pressure}} of [...] {{is indicative of}} the opinion held {{at the time that the}} economies to be gained from superheating did not require high boiler pressure. The boiler was equipped with a Schmidt superheater. Steam distribution to the four cylinders was rather unique, being led from the superheater header in the smokebox to a <b>steam</b> collector <b>box</b> which was arranged between the two cylinders of the rear engine unit, from where a branch was led to the cylinders of the front engine unit by a central steam pipe with flexible joints, since this engine unit could move sideways in relation to the boiler barrel. This pipe took the place of the usual receiver pipe on compound Mallets.|$|R

50|$|RawFaith {{was built}} in Addison, Maine, by George McKay and his three sons. Construction took 28 months, spread over four years. The {{construction}} was performed using old methods and new technology. This was exemplified {{in the use of}} a half hull model ship, <b>steam</b> <b>box,</b> 16th-century lines, and other old shipbuilding techniques, but using power tools and laminates to aid in construction and bring strength to modern standards. She was constructed out of white oak. Rawfaith was not built using shipwrights or naval architects. She was controversial in all aspects and was regarded by most professionals as being poorly built and designed.|$|E
50|$|Steam bending is a {{woodworking}} technique where {{strips of}} wood are steam heated using a <b>steam</b> <b>box.</b> The applied heat and moisture makes the wood pliable enough to easily bend around a former {{to create a}} specific shape. The moulding process is usually done by clamping the strips of wood to a positive form, with the strips of wood often reinforced on the outside with a metal band to prevent blowout. The method {{has been used in}} the manufacturing of a diverse range of products, some examples being wooden boat building where it is used in the shaping of hull's ribs and lap boards, the production of traditional wooden lacrosse sticks, musical instruments such as violins and in the manufacture of wooden furniture like the Windsor chair and much of Michael Thonet's work.|$|E

By 1913, the L&C owned three <b>steam</b> locomotives, nineteen <b>box</b> cars, two coal cars, two passenger cars and two combines. Capital stock had risen from $50,000 to $500,000. Things were going well for the small railroad.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Half-Life 2 {{was made}} {{available}} for download over the Internet, via <b>Steam.</b> A physical <b>boxed</b> copy was also sold, though it also required activation over the Internet. Valve Corporation hoped this method of distribution would take off, as it delivers {{a greater percentage of}} the sale price to the game developer than boxed copies. Valve's belief was not unfounded, as Steam became the most common method of PC game distribution by late 2009: even earlier, internet distribution surpassed physical, and as of mid-2011 is unchallenged. Many, if not most games by most publishers for the PC, not only Valve, are released as [...] "Steam" [...] electronic copies which regularly outsell physical copies. In addition, Steam's DRM {{remains one of the most}} secure available, but is very non-intrusive compared to schemes like SecuROM, which, in installing kernel-mode drivers (often somewhat inaccurately referred to as [...] "rootkits"), are often incompatible with certain hardware configurations and many pieces of third-party security software (such as software firewalls and anti-virus applications), a problem that does not plague Steam. Steam also allows consumers to back up their copy of Half-Life 2 as well as other games that are downloadable through Steam onto CDs or DVDs. To complement this feature many fans have created box coverings for jewel cases that can be downloaded and printed, giving birth to a wide variety of game packaging styles and designs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The aims {{of current}} {{research}} programme are itemised as {{to design a}} research rig simulates the desalination heat exchange process, assess the feasibility of enhanced heat transfer mechanisms in MSF plant, examining actual brine water that typifies real process conditions, study the influence of flow speeds on fouling resistance {{and the effect of}} tube diameter on its behaviour. The first apparatus designed is test-Rig (A), consists mainly of a cubic <b>box</b> simulating the <b>steam</b> condenser. Six horizontally tube are mounted, through which the coolant solution is flowing and the vapour from a boiler source is condensed outside the tubes, but inside the box. These tubes are aluminium-brass made. The test rig is instrumented {{in such a way that}} temperature at all important points in the apparatus can be monitored, as well as the flow rate of all the fluid streams. The thermocouples are inserted in the important points. Experimental results are discussed for both smooth and corrugated tube, when applying fresh and real brine water on different flow speeds. This apparatus has to be redesigned, since buckling, as well as cracks developed in the plixcy-glass box’s wall due to thermal stresses, existence of mutual heat transfer between tested tubes, existence of non-uniform distribution of <b>steam</b> through-out the <b>box,</b> venting valves need to be added to water circulation loop, modification of pumping system through automation and redesign a water reservoir to keep the inlet temperature to the rig constant. The problems revealed above with using test-rig A, are given a careful consideration in assessment and assembl...|$|R
50|$|A <b>steam</b> <b>box</b> is a long, sealed {{container}} used to steam wooden planks {{for the purpose}} of making them pliable. Once steamed and then fastened or clamped into the desired position and left to dry, the wood will hold the new shape. Steam boxes allow for much more efficient use of wood. Instead of cutting the desired shape away from a large and more expensive piece of wood and leaving much scrap to be discarded, steam boxes allow for a smaller piece to be bent in the general shape and leaving much less scrap. Steam boxes also allow the wood to bend beyond its dry breaking point, which is useful in making extreme curves with the wood. In many cases, the bent piece is stronger than an identical piece cut from larger stock. Steam bending wood allows the wood grain to follow the bend, leaving it strong where a piece cut from larger stock would snap across crosscut grains or laminated joints.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Boat {{building}} uses many or {{the same}} tools that are common house tools such as hammers, cross cut saws, power drills, benches and vices. For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G clamps or spring clamps. A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) G clamps, plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel spring clamps is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with clamps. Flat and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A <b>steam</b> <b>box</b> is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} acknowledged that web preheating improves press performance {{by lowering the}} viscosity of the water internal to the web. Improvements in web preheating translate into immediate improvements in press efficiency. Steam boxes are the universally accepted devices for preheating the web. However, {{there is little or}} no accessible literature on how best to employ steam boxes. The Institute of Paper Science and Technology, IPST, has designed, built, and tested an apparatus for evaluating web heating technologies. The apparatus consists of a sled, a track for the sled, a <b>steam</b> <b>box,</b> and a vacuum box (if specified). A single instrumented sheet is mounted on the sled, and the sled is propelled, at paper machine speeds, down the track under the <b>steam</b> <b>box.</b> The intent is to expose the instrumented sheet to the same thermodynamic and aerodynamic conditions that a continuous web experiences on a paper machine. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that the apparatus is an effective tool for investigating, under dynamic conditions, most factors affecting <b>steam</b> <b>box</b> performance. The experiments also show that a number of variables affect the ability of the <b>steam</b> <b>box</b> to thoroughly heat the web. One of the most significant variables is vacuum level at the underside of the sheet. The apparatus can be used to investigate both web heating problems on specific paper machines and fundamental processes in web heating...|$|E
40|$|A {{frequent}} {{problem when}} producing newsprint are web breaks, which result in down-time and wear on machine parts and hence a decreased yield. The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to identify production parameters that correlate to web breaks on paper machine 5 (PM 5) at Ortviken paper mill in Sundsvall. The focus is on findings from previous {{studies that have been}} considered to be important for the occurrence of web breaks. These are: • Variations of release angle at the open draw from press to dryer • The impact of skew paper web profiles on web breaks • Multivariate analysis of production parameters • Velocity fluctuations of the driver dryer rolls in the dryer • The impact of defects in the paper web on web breaks The thesis authors have applied the D. M. A. I. C method in the problem solving process. This method is applied within the Six Sigma improving program. The analysis of the profiles showed skewness in the machine. This skewness results in web feeding problems along with an increased risk of web breaks due to a skew web tension profile. Suggested improvements to solve this problem consisted of different calibrations and adjustments of the head box (distributes the pulp on the wire cloth), press, dryer and moisture profiles. No approximation of cost savings where measured. The velocity study of the dryer rolls in the dryer revealed a slack in the web break signal. This resulted in extra downtime and additional web breaks caused by debris swirling around in the machine. Machine components were also damaged due to this delay. The yearly cost savings of these problems was approximated to 400 000 SEK. A solution to this problem is under development as this thesis is being finalized and will be implemented during the spring of 2009. No correlations between defects in the paper and web breaks could be found. However, the analysis showed a higher density of defects {{at the edges of the}} paper web. High variations of edge actuators in the <b>steam</b> <b>box,</b> causing moisture variations at the edges, might generate these defects at the edges causing web breaks. It was also found that most web breaks started from the front side (FS) of the machine (facing the operators). Several of these web breaks could be explained by a non satisfactory solution for cutting the paper edges. Skew TSO and TSI profiles indicating a higher web tension on the front side, could also contribute to more web breaks on that side. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
