5|$|O'Connell's strict classics-oriented {{education}} in Ireland stood him in good stead for his early career choices of teacher and journalist. In San Francisco, he formed friendships with artists and influential men who joined {{with him in}} presenting and promoting theatrical productions and in publishing books and newspapers. He wrote short stories for magazines and journals, and lived a life rich in food, drink, and the arts. A dedicated family man in America, O'Connell never lost his Irish poet's sense of overarching sadness joined with keen pleasure in the <b>sensations</b> <b>of</b> the physical world.|$|E
5|$|The {{peripheral}} nerves of the parasympathetic {{nervous system}} that carry messages to the brain (afferent nerve fibers) may explain why people with complete SCI feel sexual and climactic sensations. One proposed explanation for orgasm in women despite complete SCI is that the vagus nerve bypasses the spinal cord and carries sensory information from the genitals directly to the brain. Women with complete injuries can achieve sexual arousal and orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris, cervix, or vagina, which are each innervated by different nerve pathways, which suggests that even if SCI interferes with one area, function might be preserved in others. In both injured and uninjured people, the brain {{is responsible for the}} way <b>sensations</b> <b>of</b> climax are perceived: the qualitative experiences associated with climax are modulated by the brain, rather than a specific area of the body.|$|E

25|$|The {{experience}} of Dominican-American cuisine {{goes beyond the}} consumption of the food, however. It is vitally integrated into the everyday culture of the Dominican-American community.

25|$|The Depth Factor– In this usage {{the word}} depth has two connotations. It {{refers to the}} actual {{physical}} <b>sensations</b> <b>of</b> depth {{in the body and}} vocal mechanism and it refers to mental concepts of depth as related to tone quality.|$|E
5000|$|A taste {{receptor}} {{is a type}} of receptor which {{facilitates the}} <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> taste. When food or other substances enter the mouth, molecules interact with saliva and are bound to taste receptors in the oral cavity and other locations. Molecules which give a <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> taste are considered [...] "sapid".|$|R
60|$|It is obviously, however, an absurdity {{not less}} gross than that <b>of</b> supposing the <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> warmth {{to exist in}} a fire, {{to imagine that the}} {{subjective}} <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> effort or resistance in ourselves can be present in external objects, when they stand in the relation of causes to other objects.|$|R

25|$|Until very recently, no one {{had ever}} {{documented}} the presence of nociceptors (the cells that detect and transmit <b>sensations</b> <b>of</b> pain) in insects, though recent findings of nociception in larval fruit flies challenges this and raises the possibility that some insects may be capable of feeling pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} {{can cause}} pain within the affected extremities, discoloration (paleness), and <b>sensations</b> <b>of</b> cold and/or numbness.

25|$|During sleep, {{especially}} REM sleep, {{people tend}} to have dreams: elusive first-person experiences, which, despite their frequently bizarre qualities, seem realistic while in progress.

25|$|Drive {{theory has}} some {{intuitive}} or folk validity. For instance when preparing food, the drive model {{appears to be}} compatible with <b>sensations</b> <b>of</b> rising hunger as the food is prepared, and, after the food has been consumed, a decrease in subjective hunger. There are several problems, however, that leave the validity of drive reduction open for debate.|$|E
25|$|General somatic <b>sensations</b> <b>of</b> a hallucinatory {{nature are}} {{experienced}} {{when an individual}} feels that their body is being mutilated, i.e. twisted, torn, or disembowelled. Other reported cases are invasion by animals in the person's internal organs such as snakes in the stomach or frogs in the rectum. The general feeling that one's flesh is decomposing is also classified under this type of hallucination.|$|E

25|$|Imagined sounds such as humming, hissing, static, zapping and buzzing noises are {{reported}} during sleep paralysis. Other sounds such as voices, whispers and roars are also experienced. These symptoms are usually accompanied by intense emotions: such as fear, and panic.

25|$|Sensation is used {{to portray}} a character's perceptions. It can help draw the reader in by {{conveying}} the actual <b>sensations</b> <b>of</b> things comprising the story, breathing life into its physical world. Since the reader has experienced {{only a portion of}} the sensations experienced by the character, the author aims to either provoke recall from the reader, or convey the experience, drawing the reader in and maintaining interest in the story.|$|E
25|$|Communes rank below cantons in Luxembourg's {{hierarchy}} of administrative subdivisions. Communes are often re-arranged, being merged or divided as demanded by demographic change over time. Unlike the cantons, which have remained unchanged since their creation, {{the identity of}} the communes has not become ingrained within the geographical <b>sensations</b> <b>of</b> the average Luxembourger. The cantons are responsible for the ceremonial, administrative, and statistical aspects of government, while the communes provide local government services.|$|E
40|$|The <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> facial {{swelling}} in temporal arteritis {{may be an}} important predictor of the development of visual disturbance. A clinical report of two patients who developed a <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> puffiness of the face without altered facial appearance, as a presenting symptom of temporal arteritis with visual disturbance is presented.

50|$|The broken {{escalator}} phenomenon, {{also known}} as the Walker effect, is the <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> losing balance or dizziness reported by some people when stepping onto an escalator which is not working.

40|$|To assess if <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> nasal mucosa {{affect the}} {{subjective}} <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> nasal patency. This {{is a case}} control study with 50 patients, using 2 % lignocaine as the active drug and normal saline as the placebo (2 groups of 25 patients each). Each subject had 2  ml of solution sprayed into the test nose. These subjects had no prior nasal symptoms, allergy or surgery. They were evaluated subjectively using Likert scale and objectively by acoustic rhinometry before and after lignocaine or normal saline. The patients in both normal saline and lignocaine groups demonstrated no significant change based upon Likert scale. The study also demonstrated the mean cross sectional area 1 (CSA 1), mean cross sectional area 2 (CSA 2), with mean Volume 1 and mean Volume 2, these results did not vary significantly in both groups with Acoustic Rhinometry. The analysis thus shows {{that the use of}} topical anesthetic spray on nasal mucosa produces no objective effect on nasal resistance or subjective <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> altered nasal patency. Thus the study concludes that, tactile <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> nasal mucosa does not {{play a role in the}} <b>sensation</b> <b>of</b> nasal obstruction...|$|R
