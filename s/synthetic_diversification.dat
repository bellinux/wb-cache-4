40|$|Tremendous {{progress}} has been made towards ortho-selective C-H functionalization in the last three decades. However, the activation of distal C-H bonds and their functionalization has remained fairly underdeveloped. Herein, we report sequential meta-C-H functionalization by performing selective mono-olefination and bis-olefination with late stage modification of the C-Si as well as Si-O bonds. Temporary silyl connection was found to be advantageous due to its easy installation, easy removal and wide <b>synthetic</b> <b>diversification...</b>|$|E
40|$|African trypanosomiasis is a {{parasitic}} disease affecting 5000 humans {{and millions of}} livestock animals in sub-Saharan Africa every year. Current treatments are limited, difficult to administer and often toxic causing long term injury or death in many patients. Trypanosome alternative oxidase is a parasite specific enzyme whose inhibition by the natural product ascofuranone (AF) {{has been shown to}} be curative in murine models. Until now synthetic methods to AF analogues have been limited, this has restricted both understanding of the key structural features required for binding and also how this chemotype could be developed to an effective therapeutic agent. The development of 3 amenable novel synthetic routes to ascofuranone-like compounds is described. The SAR generated around the AF chemotype is reported with correlation to the inhibition of T. b. brucei growth and corresponding selectivity in cytotoxic assessment in mammalian HepG 2 cell lines. These methods allow access to greater <b>synthetic</b> <b>diversification</b> and have enabled the synthesis of compounds that have and will continue to facilitate further optimisation of the AF chemotype into a drug-like lead...|$|E
40|$|Phenotypic {{diversification}} of cells {{is crucial for}} developmental and regenerative processes in multicellular organisms. The diversification concept is described as the motion of marbles rolling down Waddington’s landscape, in which the number of stable states changes as development proceeds. In contrast to this simple concept, the complexity of natural biomolecular processes prevents comprehension of their design principles. We have constructed, in Escherichia coli, a synthetic circuit with just four genes, which programs cells to autonomously diversify as the motion on the landscape through cell–cell communication. The circuit design {{was based on the}} combination of a bistable toggle switch with an intercellular signaling system. The cells with the circuit diversified into two distinct cell states, “high” and “low,” in vivo and in silico, when all of the cells started from the low state. The <b>synthetic</b> <b>diversification</b> was affected by not only the shape of the landscape determined by the circuit design, which includes the synthesis rate of the signaling molecule, but also the number of cells in the experiments. This cell-number dependency is reminiscent of the “community effect”: The fates of developing cells are determined by their number. Our synthetic circuit could be a model system for studying diversification and differentiation in higher organisms. Prospectively, further integrations of our circuit with different cellular functions will provide unique tools for directing cell fates on the population level in tissue engineering...|$|E
40|$|A general {{synthetic}} route for {{the synthesis of}} functionalized bi- and terpyridines is reported. Functionalized 1, 2, 4 -triazene 4 -oxides 7 and 8 -obtained from the reaction of hydrazones 1 with pyridine aldehydes and followed by oxidation-are functionalized by introduction of a cyano group via nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The thus-obtained 5 -cyano- 1, 2, 4 -triazines 9 and 10 undergo facile inverse-electron-demand Diels-Alder reactions with enamines and alkenes to yield functionalized bi- and terpyridines, respectively. The substituent at position 6 of the 1, 2, 4 -triazene 4 -oxides must be aromatic or heteroaromatic {{in order to allow}} their facile synthesis, but other substituents and reagents may vary. Each step of the <b>synthetic</b> route allows <b>diversification,</b> which makes the approach particularly useful for the facile synthesis of a large variety of functionalized bi- and terpyridines. ...|$|R
