40|$|An {{experimental}} {{laboratory study}} was undertaken {{to investigate the}} convective airflow which develops in compost masses {{and the effect of}} passive and active aeration on nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) losses of compost at three different levels of dry matter (d. m) with four different C sources (pine shavings, grass hay, oat straw and wheat straw). Each bulking agent was individually mixed with swine slurry and composted at 40, 32 and 28 % d. m. Duplicate mixtures were aerated for 21 days (14 days for one of the pine shavings trials) both in active and passive conditions in 100 L composters and their temperature was monitored every 3 hours. The passively aerated compost demonstrated temperature regimes {{similar to that of the}} actively aerated compost reaching and exceeding 55 °C for 3 days. The initial airflow resistance of the composts was found to be lower than the final. The convective airflow of the compost was correlated with time and to the difference in ambient and compost temperature. The 32 % d. m. content and the wood shavings compost produced higher convective airflows. The statistical significance of the effects of aeration method, d. m. level, and C source on N conservation was tested. Only the C source had a significant effect (P < 0. 05). The hay amended with urea had the lowest N losses (22. 4 %), followed by oat <b>straw,</b> hay, wood <b>shavings</b> amended with soybeans, wheat <b>straw</b> and wood <b>shavings</b> with losses of 41. 4, 53. 4, 53. 6, 55. 2 % and 68. 5 % respectively.

50|$|The {{birds are}} {{then moved to}} broiler breeder laying houses or {{production}} barns. The birds are typically placed into crates, and transported by truck to a separate facility. Males and females are raised together at this point. Outwardly the laying house will resemble the rearing house. Inside, about one-half of the floor might consist of raised 'slats.' During the production run, manure will drop through the slats and accumulate in the pit underneath the slats. The birds are not generally caged, especially since the roosters must mate with the hens to fertilize the eggs. Nests are provided for laying hens. Both automatic and manual (example) nesting systems exist. Manual nests are usually stuffed with <b>straw</b> or <b>shavings</b> and eggs are hand-collected. Automatic systems usually have a plastic carpet lining, with a belt for egg collection. Careful layout and attention to bird behavior is required to avoid 'floor eggs'.|$|R

The Experimental design used was a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with 4 treatments and 6 replications. Each treatment unit consisted of 4 chicken. The treatment applied was litter materials, which consisted of rice husk, rice <b>straw,</b> wood <b>shavings</b> and sawdust. Data obtained were analyzed using analysis of variance and continued with Honestly Significant Difference (HSD). Variables observed were body weight at harvest, packed cell volume (PCV) and number of ectoparasite Dermanyssus gallinae. Results showed that body weight at harvest of broiler kept on wood shavings was significantly (P 0. 05) on PCV. In addition, wood shavings contained significantly (P< 0. 05) less mite of Dermanyssus gallinae than the other materials. In conclusion, wood shavings was the best litter material for obtaining broiler body weight at harvest, and contained less ectoparasite microorganism, particularly of Dermanyssus gallinae, than the others.

To achieve this objective, a choice test was designed. A choice pen was constructed where birds could move freely around the four selected materials (<b>straw,</b> wood <b>shavings,</b> rice hulls and sand). Chickens were introduced in this pen in four groups of eight birds, three days a week for one hour per day and group, for four weeks. The location and the activity performed by each broiler were recorded every five minutes. Results showed a preference for sand compared with the other three substrates. However, differences between the behaviors performed in each bedding material were shown mainly for resting (preferably performed on wood <b>shavings</b> and <b>straw),</b> dust bathing (on sand), pecking and scratching (on rice hulls).

40|$|Humans {{have over}} time domesticated the horse from {{a wild animal}} into a domesticated. At first humans used horses to feed on, many years later they started to use horses as {{transportation}} and fighting gear. They also started housing the horses. Straw {{is one of the}} most common and cheapest bedding materials on the market. In earlier studies straw have shown a poor absorbency and high ammonia emission. The manufactures state that wood shaving pellets have a good absorption capacity and a low ammonia emission, there are few studies that supports this statement. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate wood shaving pellets, chopped <b>straw</b> and wood <b>shavings</b> on a daily base. The secondary aim was to calculate the economic factors on the different bedding materials. The study tested three bedding materials; wood shaving pellets, chopped <b>straw</b> and wood <b>shavings.</b> There were three groups of five to six horses in each group during five weeks of study. The experiment was located a stable at the Swedish National Equestrian Centre Strömsholm. The boxes were cleaned twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon by the students in equine studies program. The working times of cleaning the boxes, manure discharge and adding fresh bedding materials were noted. Ammonia concentration was measured in each box at one time at the end of the study. A test was made to measure how many times each bedding material could absorb its own weight of water. The data were processed statistically and the significance level was set at p< 0. 05. An analysis of variance was done to find significant differences between treatments (bedding material) and where appropriate significant differences were followed with post-hoc test (Holm-Sidak). This study showed that wood shaving pellets was not profitable compared to chopped <b>straw</b> and wood <b>shavings.</b> The uppermost reason was the high purchase price, the material would be more profitable if the price was lower seeing that the material had the lowest working time, manure discharge and the lowest ammonia emission and should therefore be considered as a bedding material. Chopped straw was the bedding material that became most profitable due to the low purchase price, even though it had the highest working time and manure discharge. The studies first hypothesis “wood shaving pellets has a lower working time than wood shavings and chopped straw” was accepted. The other hypothesis “wood shavings is the most profitable bedding material” was rejected...|$|R

Despite a positional bias, horses clearly showed a preference for straw bedding (42 · 9 (s. e. 3 · 6)) over shavings (35 ·- 2 (s. e. 3 · 4) %, P < 0 · 05;, straw (42 · 0 (s. e. 3 · 7) %) over paper (29 · 3 (s. e. 3 · 4) %, P < 0 · 05) and shavings (41 · 6 (s. e. 4 · 3) %) over paper (27 · 7 (s. e. 3 · 7) %, P < 0 · 001) based on percentage of observed time spent on the substrate. Straw bedding increased the occurrence of bedding related activities, with more of these activities in choices where straw was available (P < 0 · 001) and in these choices the activities being preferentially expressed in the straw alternative (P < 0 · 001).

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to discuss the impact of group size on {{damaging}} behaviours, aggression, fear and stress in farm animals and to identify housing- and management options that can help to reduce problems caused by suboptimal group sizes. Increasing group size was found to {{increase the risk of}} damaging behaviour, such as feather pecking in laying hens and vulva biting in sows. Aggression {{does not appear to be}} a problem in large groups, because dominance relationships in these groups are not based on individual recognition, but based on other signals such as body size, avoiding costly fights. There is evidence for increased fear and stress levels in large groups compared with small groups, but fearfulness is also strongly affected by type of housing. To minimise problems in large groups, is seems helpful to offer separate functional areas and to provide cover, reducing disturbance between animals. To minimise the risk of damaging behaviour, such as feather pecking in laying hens and tail biting in pigs, stimulating foraging, exploration and manipulation behaviour by providing sufficient substrate (<b>straw,</b> wood <b>shavings</b> and sand) offers perspective. Rearing the animals in a system which allows the development of all these behaviours is very important. Other solutions can be found in optimising the diet and offering extra foraging opportunities. Furthermore, genetic selection against damaging behaviour seems promising. In conclusion, group size mainly has an effect on damaging behaviour and fear and stress in pigs and poultry. The effect on aggressive behaviour is limited. To reduce damaging behaviour, fear and stress, it is important to provide a complex environment with ample behavioural opportunities and separate functional areas...|$|R

Before weaning, piglets (n = 320) were housed in an enriched (<b>straw,</b> wood <b>shavings,</b> peat and branches) or barren pen with a confined or loose-housed sow (n = 32). Loose-housed sows and their piglets could eat together from a family feeder, whereas confined sows and piglets had separate feeding troughs. Piglets (n = 256) were mixed postweaning and 4 piglets from each litter were relocated to a barren pen (n = 32 pens) and 4 other piglets were housed in an enriched pen (n = 32 pens). Growth from d 15 until weaning was higher for piglets from enriched pens (4. 38 ± 0. 29 versus 4. 71 ± 0. 21 kg/pig, P 0. 25). Piglets from enriched preweaning pens ate more in the first 2 d postweaning than piglets from barren pens (first 48 h, barren 0. 45 ± 0. 05 kg/pig, enriched 0. 53 ± 0. 04 kg/pig, P < 0. 05). Piglets relocated to an enriched pen after weaning showed a higher growth in the 2 wk after weaning (barren 5. 5 ± 0. 2 kg/pig, enriched 6. 2 ± 0. 2 kg/pig, P < 0. 0001), had a profoundly lower diarrhea prevalence than piglets housed in barren pens after weaning (barren 2. 4 ± 0. 4 d, enriched 1. 0 ± 0. 3 d, P < 0. 0001), and had a higher feed efficiency (barren 0. 81 ± 0. 03, enriched 0. 85 ± 0. 02, P < 0. 05). Enrichment of the preweaning environment likely stimulates development of feeding behaviors and consequently increases feed intake immediately after weaning.

In this study, samples of horse faeces were analysed for chemical composition as pure feedstock and in mixture with <b>straw</b> or wood <b>shavings,</b> {{as well as}} for energy yield by biogas production or from combustion of solid fuel. It was observed that chemical properties of faeces, in a mixture with wood shavings, were promising for direct combustion, but achieved low methane yields. The methane yield of pure faeces and the straw mixture was 222. 33 ± 13. 60 and 233. 01 ± 31. 32 lN·kg- 1 volatile solids (VS) added, respectively. The IFBB process divided the biomass into a press cake with reduced mineral concentration and a press fluid. Methane yields of press fluids were low (108. 2 lN·kg- 1 VSadded, on average). The chemical composition of the press cake allowed for combustion and led to a higher gross energy potential than anaerobic digestion (two-fold higher for pure manure and the mixture with straw, and five-fold higher for the mixture with shavings). Consequently, the gross energy potential of IFBB is higher compared to anaerobic digestion, however {{it should be noted that}} local conditions might favour the implementation of anaerobic digestion...|$|R
40|$|Technological food processing, such as {{grilling}} and smoking, {{can produce}} {{high levels of}} PAH in treated products, and risk for human health {{is related to the}} type of ingested food and the frequency of consumption. However, the recent legislation (Regulation EC 835 / 2011) on maximum levels of PAHs in foods did not set limits for milk and dairy products, including smoked cheeses, even if some smoking techniques can cause formation and accumulation of PAHs on food. Among smoked cheese, smoked buffalo mozzarella or "provola" is a typical product with DOP mark, it may be PAH contaminated. During traditional smoking process Mozzarella was exposed to smoke obtained from the incomplete <b>straw</b> or wood <b>shavings</b> combustion in smoking room. Alternatively, the smoked product is obtained by immersing the cheese in the so-called "liquid smoke", a solution obtained through condensation and filtration of smoke. Sometimes, illegal procedures, as corrugated paper or varnished wood combustion, are employed for smoking food production. The authorized materials are wheat <b>straw,</b> wood <b>shavings</b> of fir, beech or alder bark, which are placed in special containers. This thesis project aimed to assess levels and distribution of B(a) P and other three marker PAHs (PAH 4), as suggested by EFSA in the smoked buffalo mozzarella cheese obtained by different smoking techniques usually employed in dairies of Campania. Besides the influence of different techniques, permitted or non by law, on the content of PAHs in mozzarella was evaluated. This research, aimed to study the migration of PAHs from the external surface (rind) of the mozzarella, more exposed to the smoke, into core and so consumer exposure to these contaminants through ingestion of whole mozzarella. For this purpose were analyzed separately out of mozzarella (rind), core and whole product. 50 batches of samples of buffalo mozzarella, each of 16 samples (250 gr), produced according to the specifications established by the Decree (D. Mi. PAF. 2003), in a dairy farm located in the Salerno province (Campania) and with CE mark. Once produced, mozzarella samples were transported to another dairy, where, a mozzarella was not smoked and conceded as blank matrix while groups of three mozzarella were smoked with different techniques such as combustion of cardboard, bark of alder, chips of fir or beech, wheat straw and liquid smoke. The obtained results showed a not PAH contamination in non-smoked mozzarella cheese samples and in the core of smoked ones. About the rind, highest levels were found in sample obtained from cardboard combustion and in particular BaP levels ranged from 110 to 417. 8 µg/kg. However, the levels found in traditional techniques were highest in samples obtained by bark of alder combustion (5. 1 µg/kg – 54. 0 µg/kg), followed by chips of fir or beech combustion (1. 5 µg/kg – 44. 3 µg/kg) and straw (0. 2 µg/kg – 28. 2 µg/kg). Considering the whole products, similar trend was observed. In particular, the use of illegal techniques such as cardboard combustion showed highest BaP (median 8. 3 µg/kg), while in traditional techniques bark of alder showed a median of 2. 8 µg/kg, followed by chips of fir or beech with a median 1. 2 µg/kg and finally, by straw with a median of 0. 4 µg/kg. All sample obtained by immersion in liquid smoke showed not detectable PAH levels both in rind and in whole product. A statistical analysis was carried out in order to evaluate if the time can effect on the PAH formation, and any statistical differences were found. However the use of different materials and techniques can produce a different amount of PAH in smoked food. A statistical analysis showed that the rind can represent a barrier to migration of generated PAH into the core of the products and it so can support the accumulation of these compounds. For this reason it is recommended to remove the rind until the ingestion of this smoked cheese, considering also that our data are always higher than daily intake and intake for person evaluated by EFSA, except for liquid smoke. This suggests that mozzarella subjected to treatment with liquid smoke is preferable to the those smoked with traditional procedures...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to examine the digging behaviour of rabbits in captivity. This survey contained questions for rabbit owners regarding their rabbits´ living environment and digging opportunities. The survey was made available online and after 23 days a total of 337 different individuals had answered. Nine out of ten respondents thought that domesticated rabbits have a behavioural need to dig. However some of them indicated that the need to dig for rabbits is individual, which could be likely. The {{majority of the respondents}} also indicated that they provide their rabbits with digging opportunities on a daily basis. The results nevertheless showed that a small layer of bedding {{on the bottom of the}} cage did not provide a sufficient digging opportunity because it was connected with a higher probability of abnormal digging behaviour. The majority of the respondents gave their rabbits’ <b>shavings,</b> <b>straw</b> or hay as litter whilst they responded that peat or earth would be the best digging material for rabbits. The results from the survey supports the literature stating that rabbits may have a need to perform digging behaviour even if they live in captivity. It is however possible that other behavioral needs such as freedom of movement are more important to avoid stereotypic behaviours. Providing the rabbits with opportunities to dig outside or give them big crates filled with a deep layer of peat, earth or sand, should give them opportunity to perform their natural digging behaviour. This ought to be clarified in the animal welfare legislation in Sweden to increase the knowledge and requirements of how rabbits should be kept in a way that benefits natural behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Weaning of piglets in {{commercial}} husbandry systems is earlier and more abrupt than would happen under natural conditions, {{resulting in low}} feed intakes and health and welfare problems in the immediate postweaning period. Piglets {{in commercial}} systems generally have limited opportunities {{to learn how to}} behave and eat like a pig. Interacting more with the sow, as well as providing enrichment, may stimulate the development of social and foraging related behaviours, and make piglets better able to adapt to the postweaning situation. Piglets were housed in a barren or enriched pen with a confined or loose-housed sow preweaning, and at weaning at d 29 were relocated to a barren or enriched pen postweaning (2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, eight treatments, eight pens per treatments, four pigs per pen). Enrichment consisted of increased space allowance, <b>straw,</b> wood <b>shavings,</b> peat and branches. Behaviour was recorded on 4 days pre-(weekly) and postweaning (d 1, 5, 9 and 12). The development of social behaviours and foraging related behaviours was positively affected by enrichment of the lactation pen, but less by sow housing. Postweaning behaviour was most strongly affected by postweaning enrichment, with enriched housed piglets showing higher levels of exploratory behaviours (27 % versus 10 % of observations), lower levels of belly nosing (0. 1 % versus 1. 0 %) and manipulative behaviours (0. 2 % versus 1. 5 %), but also less time spent eating (8 % versus 9 %) than piglets in barren postweaning pens. Piglets from loose-housed sows showed lower levels of belly nosing (0. 3 % versus 0. 7 %) and manipulative behaviour (0. 8 % versus 0. 9 %), as well as more chewing (6. 1 % versus 5. 5 %), food exploration (1. 0 % versus 0. 8 %) and play behaviour (0. 9 % versus 0. 7 %) postweaning than piglets from confined sows. Enrichment of the lactation pen in itself had few effects on postweaning behaviour, but interacted strongly with postweaning enrichment and sow housing, with piglets from a loose-housed sow switching from a barren to enriched environment showing high levels of play behaviour while piglets from a confined sow switching from an enriched to a barren environment showed high levels of belly nosing and low levels of play (barren-loose-enriched: 1. 8 % of observations, enriched-confined-barren: 0. 1 % of observations). Enrichment pre- and postweaning, as well as providing more possibilities to interact with the sow, can thus positively affect how piglet behaviour develops before weaning and how they adapt after weaning. It is important to realize that the preweaning environment, including sow housing, affects how piglets value their postweaning environment and may thus greatly affect piglet welfare around weaning...|$|R
