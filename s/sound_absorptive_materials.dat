40|$|The Heat Ventilation Air Conditioning System (HVAC) {{is one of}} the ducting {{systems that}} are {{commonly}} found to make occupants in the building comfortable by controlling the temperature and air flow. However, noise is produced in the system and reaches the occupants inside the building, thus causing distraction, discomfort and uneasiness. There are HVAC silencers in the market, however the typical sound absorbing material used is mineral wool types. This research focuses on the ducting silencer with the sound absorbing material that made from Coconut fiber, Arenga Pinnata (Ijuk), Kenaf, Cotton and Rockwool. The compositions of these materials have been tested to identify its performance. The objective of this research is to compare the insertion loss in the HVAC by using various configurations. The materials have been tested separately at various frequencies {{to determine the effects of}} the forward airflow in the HVAC system in the transmission loss and to analyse the affect of the insertion loss on the straight and bend in the HVAC duct system. The experiment that was carried out follows the standard ASTM E 477. In this experiment, the sound absorbing material of Coconut fiber with different configuration has been investigated, followed by other types of <b>sound</b> <b>absorptive</b> <b>materials</b> such as Arenga Pinnata (Ijuk), Kenaf, Cotton and Rockwool. From the overall result and comparison, all the materials that tested on straight and bend ducting showed the same performance trends where at below frequency of 500 Hz the insertion loss was high at certain frequency only. The insertion loss increases steadily from 500 Hz until 6300 Hz and maintained until frequency 10000 Hz at around 6 dB to 40 dB. The insertion loss increase as the numbers of <b>sound</b> <b>absorptive</b> <b>materials</b> in the silencer increase but the 4 pieces configuration has been chosen as the best configuration because the air flow was higher around 60 % compared to configuration of 5 pieces. The insertion loss of 30 g Rockwool combined with 30 g Cotton was higher compared to other materials which are averagely 44. 8 % higher than Rockwool alone, 44. 1 % higher than Cotton alone, 35 % higher than Kenaf alone, 81. 4 % higher than combination of Arenga Pinnata and Kenaf, 65. 1 % higher than Coconut fiber alone, and 118. 9 % higher than Arenga Pinnata alone. The insertion loss at straight and bend ducting that was analysed showed that the bend ducting gave more insertion loss at an average of 47 % than the straight ducting...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Currently, {{one of the}} {{important}} topics in acoustic science is noise control. It is important to control the noise in order to minimize extraneous noise in rooms, buildings, and our environment. Noise control can be achieved by reducing the intensity of sound to the level that is not harmful to human ear. There are four basic principles employed to reduce noise which is absorption, isolation, vibration isolation, and vibration damping. In fact, the most recognized technique to reduce noise is sound absorption on the materials itself. Sound absorption on material such as wood and porous material have been developed and studied by few researchers. Materials that reduce the sound intensity as the sound wave passes through it by the phenomenon of absorption are called <b>sound</b> <b>absorptive</b> <b>materials.</b> There are lot of methods can be used on determining the sound absorption coefficient of materials. In this paper, a preliminary work has been carried out experimentally to determine the sound absorption coefficient of four types of Malaysian wood. They are Tapang (Koompassia excels), Pulai (Alstonai angustiloba), Selunsor merah (Tristianiopsis beccariana) and Jelutong (Dyera polyphylla). The test was performed using the ASTM E 1050 - 98 /ISO 10534 - 2 (American Society for Testing and Material) standards for the sound absorption coefficient testing. This method is known as impedance tube method (Two-Microphone Method). The absorption coefficient depends on the frequencies. In this study the values of the frequencies used was in the range from 350 Hz to 1000 Hz...|$|E
40|$|Tonal noise {{emitted from}} large-diameter spray dryer exhaust stacks {{used in the}} dairy {{industry}} can give rise to complaints from nearby communities. In many cases, the tone at the fan blade passing frequency {{is characterized by a}} frequency above the first mode cut on frequency of the exhaust stack and both its amplitude and the frequency are time varying. The variation in amplitude is a result of turbulence and temperature variations in the duct which cause angular variations in the nodal plane of modes with diametrical nodes. This in turn results in large fluctuations in sound pressure with time at any specified location in the duct, thus presenting a significant challenge for an ANC system with fixed control source and error sensor locations. In many food processing industries, the use of <b>sound</b> <b>absorptive</b> <b>materials</b> in silencers is not acceptable and, particularly when the fan speed is variable, it is difficult to achieve an acceptable passive solution at a reasonable cost. Here, the design and implementation of an active noise control system for tonal noise propagating above the cut-on frequency of the first higher order mode in large size cylindrical industrial exhaust stack is discussed, where the frequency and amplitude vary significantly and relatively rapidly with time. Physical system design principles and control algorithm optimization for a practical active noise control system are presented. Finally, real time control results which were achieved by a prototype installation on a large-diameter, in-service exhaust stack are given. Significant noise reductions were achieved in the community. X. Li, X. Qiu, D. L. L. Leclercq, A. C. Zander and C. H. Hansen[URL]...|$|E

Natural fibres often have great mechanical properties, have no harmful effects on health, and are available in large quantities often as a waste product of other production cycles. However, great demands for composite porous material contribute to the potential application of natural fibre as sound absorption panel. To assist in that effort, the research presented here studies the feasibility of using selected four kinds of natural fibres which are Ijuk, Kenaf, Coconut coir and Palm oil frond fibre blended separately with natural rubber as <b>sound</b> <b>absorptive</b> <b>materials.</b> Therefore, an experimental investigation was performed to evaluate the acoustical performance characterization and physical properties under qualify applied methods to obtain it. The natural fibres were processed {{with a combination of}} natural rubber at 0 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 % composition, respectively. The samples were produced based on diameter size required by impedance tube (ASTM E 1050) and the thickness remains at 50 mm. The sound absorption coefficient (a), test results indicated that samples made by 20 % of natural rubber as binder context exhibit optimum acoustical properties compared other mixing percentage. Among the four kinds of natural fibre, Ijuk exposed peak result on the sound absorption coefficient of 0. 96 at low frequency 1000 Hz and 0. 98 at high frequency 3000 Hz. Overall, the samples made by natural fibre with natural rubber combination were giving a better acoustical performance that outcomes more than 0. 6 sound absorption coefficient value after the mid to high range frequencies to and by that it is capable of using in acoustical treatment especially in low frequency.

30|$|Floor impact noises are {{considered}} as structure-borne sounds that {{are caused by}} either impacting on or vibrating directly on the structure, and then travelling through the entire building (Uno 1992). In general, one of the effective methods to lower the floor impact sounds is to separate or isolate the noise from its source. There {{are a number of}} approaches to lower the influence of floor impact noise, such as increasing the thickness of concrete slab, inserting <b>sound</b> <b>absorptive</b> <b>materials,</b> and creating space to isolate the sound sources. A number of studies point out {{that one of the most}} effective methods to separate the floor impact sounds in concrete structures is through the use of floating floors (Schiavi 2018; Miškinis et al. 2012; Martins et al. 2015; Faustino et al. 2012; D’alessandro et al. 2014; Sipari 2002). A floating floor is a combination of concrete slab and resilient, as well as sound absorbing, material, such as rubber (D’alessandro et al. 2014; Jeon et al. 2006; Schiavi 2018). Neves e Sopusa and Gibbs (2011) compared both homogeneous concrete floors and floating floors in dwellings. In their study, the floating floor would be beneficial to insulate low frequency impact sound transmission. Schiavi (2018) tested various resilient materials, such as glass fibre, polyester fibre, cork, and rubber grains, to form floating structures in the concrete slab. Cho (2013) indicated that the concrete slab with resilient layers would be useful to insulate floor impact sound, compared to the normal concrete slab. In this study, the voided slab system, which is filled with lightweight expanded polystyrene (EPS), is suggested as one of the floating floor systems to isolate and separate the floor impact sounds in a commercial–residential complex building. The EPS void formers were designed as a means of isolating floor impact sound in the concrete structure. In order to verify the usefulness and effectiveness of the voided slab systems for lightweight and heavyweight floor impact sound insulation, a field test was conducted to evaluate the sound insulation performance in the studied building.|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} research project [SPR 2418; 2 ̆ 2 Study {{of the performance}} of acoustic barriers for Indiana toll roads, 2 ̆ 2] the influence of environmental factors and of advanced sound barrier concepts was investigated. The presence of temperature gradients over pavements was found to have a strong influence on sound propagation. Refraction of sound waves emitted by tire-road interactions {{in the vicinity of the}} ground also affects sound barrier performance. Modified ray tracing model suggested that prevailing winds have an influence on barrier performance at large distances. Randomized edge configurations were found not to improve barrier performance for traffic noise. Random edges simply scatter sound energy without any net noise reduction. Although the edge can be optimized for specific frequency components and locations, it appears that optimization for broadband noise control is difficult. The study also suggested that adding <b>sound</b> <b>absorptive</b> <b>material</b> along the barrier edge could enhance barrier performance. The present study is the continuation of the latter effort to confirm the findings related to the <b>sound</b> <b>absorptive</b> treatment on the barrier through a more rigorous study and to apply the design concept to a realistic situation. A comparison was made between barriers that incorporated <b>sound</b> <b>absorptive</b> treatments and barriers with T-shaped tops. The results confirmed that a <b>sound</b> <b>absorptive</b> treatment near the barrier edge resulted in a performance improvement over corresponding rigid barriers. A design optimization study of the most effective shape of acoustic treatments concluded that a circular shape works best. The performance of two different acoustical materials was also compared. Use of glassfiber resulted in better performance in the high frequency region, while polyolefin foam with closed cells achieved a relatively large insertion loss at low frequencies. Efforts were made to develop a numerical predictive model. The boundary element method was used to model the infinite size surrounding fluid effectively. The disadvantage of the boundary element model is the calculation load associated with the large number of elements required for high frequency analysis. A mesh optimization procedure was successfully implemented in the boundary element model to reduce the calculation time while satisfying the tolerances for analysis accuracy at each analysis frequency. Octave band averaging was also adapted to facilitate the comparison between the numerical results and experimental data. It was found that the results from the boundary element model agree relatively well with the experimental results up to 6300 Hz at selected locations. The insertion loss distribution proved the numerical model 2 ̆ 7 s capability of reproducing the rather complicated interference pattern on the receiver plane correctly at one-third octave band frequencies from 1000 Hz to 6300 Hz. Spatial-averaged insertion losses over different size receiver planes showed that the numerical model was less reliable when the averaging was done close to the ground level. Preliminary measurements for an actual, real-size barrier were performed in South Bend, Indiana, to identify a measurement location that can be used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed add-on device. The add-on device was designed based on laboratory experiments and numerical studies, and was proven to be effective in a realistic highway environment. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Traffic Noise Model (TNM) was exercised for the comparison of the measurements. On-site measurements were performed to evaluate the absorptive treatment. Application of the treatment over a limited (6 m) region improved the performance of the barrier by 2 to 5 dB at the frequencies from 2000 Hz to 5000 Hz...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{optimize}} the geometry and the acoustical properties of noise barriers for traffic noise applications. The approach consisted of performing scale-model experiments in a laboratory environment and developing corresponding boundary element models.

First, the simple geometry was chosen to validate the use of boundary element models for the prediction of scattered diffraction. More complicated geometries were investigated to study the effects of geometry on sound barrier performance. The performance of straight-edge barriers with various top geometries and <b>sound</b> <b>absorptive</b> treatments was then investigated. Experiments were performed using a finite-size barrier in an anechoic chamber. The results confirmed that a <b>sound</b> <b>absorptive</b> treatment near the edge has a performance advantage over corresponding rigid barriers.

Space-averaged insertion loss over different size receiver planes was also used to confirm the numerical results.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{need to save}} {{material and}} energetic resources, allied with a growing concern on the environmental issues and incertitude {{on the evolution of}} the economy, has impelled minimalist-approaches to Architecture and Engineering, reducing to the minimum necessary expression the building elements. The development of new lightweight materials, most of them composites with fibrous reinforcement systems, has interest for building materials and textile industries. However, these materials still do not have a significant implementation in the building industry or, at least, this implementation is not being made exploring all their potentialities. Non load bearing interior partition walls are thin elements built to divide the indoor space into rooms or other compartments. Porous materials applied in interior partition walls have a significant importance in these building elements because sound insulation is an important requirement. Walls must provide an airborne sound barrier between rooms in a same dwelling and especially between different dwellings, this last issue as a compulsory requirement to fulfil in Portuguese regulations. In the present study it will be considered a lightweight interior partition wall composed by insulation material and layered within two membranes. The process of selecting materials for that interior partition wall is a challenging task. This paper intends to compare results of functional (acoustic and thermal) performance of materials such as expandable polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane foam (PU), Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), 3 D warp knitted polyester fabrics (3 DWK), Cork (CK), Expanded Cork (CKE), Rockwool (RW), coconut fibber (CCF), silicone (SI), waste fiber (WF), to discuss about their potentialities as insulation or membrane materials applied in interior dividing walls technologies. It also presents a morphological characterization of materials, through microscopic analysis, in order to define the relationship between the morphology and acoustic performance. The results of tests are compared with reference values of rock wool as insulation material - conventionally used in lightweight dividing walls made of plasterboard leaves and light gauge steel framing structure. One of the results of this paper is that a lightweight and thin interior partition wall filled with insulation material present acoustic advantages when compared with a heavyweight interior partition wall with more thickness. The concept of membrane goes back to the Latin word “membrana”, meaning parchment or skin. In previous studies it could be verified that low density makes membrane structures poor thermal and acoustic insulators. However, it is available in the market heavily coated or microperforated membranes that have dampening effect A low density generally also implies a high porosity or a high volume of voids, which leads to a decrease in the thermal conductivity. In previous studies from the same authors, it was concluded that the presence of air gap between insulation materials in a lightweight interior partition can increase the acoustic insulation between 2 to 5 dB, the inclusion of porous materials in the air gap can contribute between 1 to 4 dB in thicknesses till 10 cm. The compromise between thermal and acoustic performance should also be attended. However thermal performance is only a requirement for interior partition walls between useful and non useful areas in housing buildings. In this study it will be presented results for different densities of insulation material. In the process of airborne sound transmission between two spaces, should be distinguished: a) direct transmission, that occurs directly through the separation element; or b) marginal transmission - that occurs through other building elements interlocked to the element of separation in study. The direct transmission can occur through joints, cracks or discontinuance of the construction element or through the construction element vibration. The heat transfer coefficient calculation tests were conducted according UNE EN 6946. The sound insulation estimation between locals was conducted according to EN 12354 - 1.
