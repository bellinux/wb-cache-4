In this study, in order to evaluate behaviors of "Concentrically <b>Steel</b> <b>Braced</b> Frames" types defined in TEC- 2007 under lateral loads, dimensional analysis of Concentrically <b>Steel</b> <b>Braced</b> Frames designed with different scales and dimensions was conducted, the results were controlled according to TEC- 2007, and after conducting static pushover analysis, behavior and load capacity of the Concentrically <b>Steel</b> <b>Braced</b> Frames and hinges sequence of the elements constituting the Concentrically <b>Steel</b> <b>Braced</b> Frames were tested. Concentrically <b>Steel</b> <b>Braced</b> Frames that were tested analytically consist of 2 storey and one bay, and are formed as two groups with the scales 1 / 2 and 1 / 3. In the study, Concentrically <b>Steel</b> <b>Braced</b> Frames described in TEC- 2007 were designed, which are 7 types in total being non-braced, X-braced, V-braced, Λ-braced, braced, /-braced and K-braced. Furthermore, in order to verify accuracy of the analytic studies performed, the 1 / 2 scaled concentrically steel X-braced frame test element made up of box profiles and 1 / 3 scaled reinforced concrete frame with insufficient earthquake resistance were tested individually under lateral loads, and test results were compared with the results derived from analytic studies and interpreted. Similar results were obtained from both experimental studies and pushover analyses. According to pushover analysis results, load-carrying capacity of 1 / 3 scaled reinforced concrete frames increased up to 7, 01 times as compared to the non-braced specimen upon strengthening. Results acquired from the study revealed that reinforced concrete buildings which have inadequate seismic capacity can be strengthened quickly, easily and economically by this method without evacuating them...|$|R

In this study pushover analysis of the 1 / 3 scaled 1 reinforced concrete frame and 1 / 3 scaled 4 strengthened reinforced concrete frames with internal eccentric <b>steel</b> <b>braced</b> frames were conducted by SAP 2000 program.

It was the first Soviet indigenous two-seat fighter. It was a single-bay biplane with its wings arranged in a sesquiplane configuration. The oval-shaped, semi-monocoque fuselage was made of 'shpon', molded birch plywood. The wings were also covered with 'shpon'. The upper wing had two spars, but the lower wing only had one. Internal bracing wires were not used in the wings as it was built up from plywood ribs with large lightening holes and stringers. V-struts made from Duralumin separated the wings and connected the upper wing to the fuselage. <b>Steel</b> <b>bracing</b> wires were used externally. An airfoil enclosed the axle of the fixed undercarriage and a small ski served as a tailskid. It had an imported [...] Napier Lion engine enclosed in a metal cowling.

Seismic performance of this new structure was analyzed under frequent earthquake and severe earthquake. The analysis focused mainly on displacement response, seismic base shear distribution and failure mechanism. Comparing with traditional steel frame-RC core wall structure, this new type of hybrid structure presents better coorporative working performance since mega <b>steel</b> <b>braced</b> frame provides larger stiffness and composite steel plate shear wall provides a fairly ductile response. It can be observed from the failure mechanism that this structure has multiple seismic resistant systems with composite steel plate shear wall, mega braces and mega frame when subjected to severe earthquakes...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} an {{experimental}} support on seismic performance evaluation of the <b>steel</b> <b>braced</b> truss-RC (reinforced concrete) column hybrid structure, which could be applied as the air-cooled supporting structural system in large-capacity thermal power plants located in strong earthquake prone regions. A series of pseudo-dynamic tests (PDTs) and quasi-static tests (QSTs) were performed on a 1 / 8 -scaled sub-structure. The dynamic characteristics, lateral deformation patterns, deterioration behavior, hysteretic behavior and failure mechanisms were investigated. Test {{results showed that the}} first vibration mode is torsion, which is caused by the small torsional stiffness of this kind of hybrid structure. The lateral deformation shape is shear mode, and the drift ratio of the structure above the corbel is significantly less than that of the column below the corbel. Earthquake energy is mainly dissipated by the RC pipe columns where cracks mainly occurred at the bottom of column and lower part of corbel. The failure mechanisms were identified indicating that the <b>steel</b> <b>braces</b> improved the global stiffness and modified the load transfer mechanism. This study affirms that the <b>steel</b> <b>braced</b> truss-RC column hybrid structure has the sufficient ductility and good energy dissipation capacity to satisfy the design requirements in high seismic regions...|$|R
