2500|$|The British Virgin Islands is a {{dependent}} {{territory of the}} United Kingdom.

2500|$|Under {{pressure}} from national Republicans {{to be more}} moderate, General Schofield continued to administer the state through the Army. He appointed a personal friend, Henry H. Wells as provisional governor. Wells was a Carpetbagger and a former Union general. Schofield and Wells fought and defeated Hunnicutt and the Scalawag Republicans. They took away contracts for state printing orders from [...] Hunnicutt's newspaper. The national government ordered elections in 1869 that included {{a vote on the}} new Underwood constitution, a separate one on its two disfranchisement clauses that would have permanently stripped the vote from most former rebels, and a <b>separate</b> <b>vote</b> for state officials. The Army enrolled the Freedmen (ex-slaves) as voters but would not allow some 20,000 prominent whites to vote or hold office. The Republicans nominated Wells for governor, as Hunnicutt and most Scalawags went over to the opposition.|$|E

2500|$|On 25 October 1971, the United States moved that a <b>separate</b> <b>vote</b> {{be taken}} on the {{provisions}} in the resolution [...] "to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupied at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it" [...] in the draft resolution. This motion would have allowed the PRC to join the UN as [...] "China's representative", while allowing the ROC to remain a regular UN member (if there had been enough votes for it). The motion was rejected {{by a vote of}} 61 to 51, with 16 abstentions. [...] The representative of ROC made a declaration that the rejection of the 22-power draft resolution calling for a two-thirds majority was a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter which governed the expulsion of Member States and that the delegation of the Republic of China had decided not to take part in any further proceedings of the General Assembly. [...] With the support from 26 African UN Member States and in accordance with Article 18 of the UN Charter, the Assembly then adopted Resolution 2758, with 76 countries supporting, 35 countries opposing, 17 countries abstaining, and 3 countries non-voting, withdrawing recognition of the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek as the legitimate representative of China, and recognizing the Government of PRC as the only legitimate representative of China to the United Nations. At a Security Council meeting on November 23, 1971, after the General Assembly passed Resolution 2758, the President of the Council and the other representatives made statements welcoming the representatives of the People's Republic of China. The ROC lost not only its Security Council seat, but any representation in the UN.|$|E
