40|$|<b>Scavenger</b> receptors mediate uptake of {{modified}} low density lipoproteins by macrophages. The {{accumulation of}} lipids via {{this process is}} thought to lead to foam cell formation in developing atherosclerotic plaques. Smooth muscle cells, which can also be converted to foam cells in vivo, have not been shown to express the same <b>scavenger</b> receptor previously cloned in macrophages. We report the cloning of two cDNAs that encode type I and type II <b>scavenger</b> receptors isolated from rabbit smooth muscle cells. The deduced protein sequences of these isolates are highly homologous to the <b>scavenger</b> receptors previously isolated from macrophages. Treatment of smooth muscle cells with phorbol esters induced a marked increase in <b>scavenger</b> receptor mRNA and a fivefold increase in receptor degradation activity. Rabbit venous endothelial cells in primary culture and a bovine aortic endothelial cell line had no detectable <b>scavenger</b> receptor mRNA, despite having <b>scavenger</b> receptor degradation activity. The latter finding suggests that endothelial cells may possess a <b>scavenger</b> receptor which is structurally distinct from that found in macrophages and smooth muscle cells. The isolation of cDNAs encoding the rabbit <b>scavenger</b> receptor should prove useful for in vitro and in vivo studies that employ the rabbit {{as a model of}} human atherosclerosis...|$|R

5|$|Coastal areas {{provide a}} {{constant}} food supply, and in particularly plentiful areas, some Andean condors limit their foraging area to several kilometers of beach-front land. They locate carrion by spotting it or by following other <b>scavengers,</b> such as corvids or other vultures. It may follow New World vultures {{of the genus}} Cathartes—the turkey vulture (C. aura), the lesser yellow-headed vulture (C. burrovianus), and the greater yellow-headed vulture (C. melambrotus)—to carcasses. The Cathartes vultures forage by smell, detecting the scent of ethyl mercaptan, a gas produced by the beginnings of decay in dead animals. These smaller vultures cannot rip through the tougher hides of these larger animals with {{the efficiency of the}} larger condor, and their interactions are often an example of mutual dependence between species. Black vultures (Coragyps atratus), king vultures (Sarcoramphus papa) and even mammalian <b>scavengers</b> may sometimes track Cathartes vultures for carcasses but the condor is invariably dominant among the <b>scavengers</b> in its range. Andean condors are intermittent eaters in the wild, often going for a few days without eating, then gorging themselves on several pounds at once, sometimes {{to the point of being}} unable to lift off the ground. Because its feet and talons are not adapted to grasping, it must feed while on the ground. Like other carrion-feeders, it plays an important role in its ecosystem by disposing of carrion which would otherwise be a breeding ground for disease.|$|E

40|$|<b>Scavenger</b> receptors act as membrane-bound and soluble {{proteins}} that bind to macromolecular complexes and pathogens. This diverse supergroup of proteins mediates binding to modified lipoprotein particles which regulate the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic plaques. In vascular tissues, <b>scavenger</b> receptors are implicated in regulating intracellular signaling, lipid accumulation, foam cell development, and cellular apoptosis or necrosis {{linked to the}} pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. One approach is using gene therapy to modulate <b>scavenger</b> receptor function in atherosclerosis. Ectopic expression of membrane-bound <b>scavenger</b> receptors using viral vectors can modify lipid profiles and {{reduce the incidence of}} atherosclerosis. Alternatively, expression of soluble <b>scavenger</b> receptors can also block plaque initiation and progression. Inhibition of <b>scavenger</b> receptor expression using a combined gene therapy and RNA interference strategy also holds promise for long-term therapy. Here we review our current understanding of the gene delivery by viral vectors to cells and tissues in gene therapy strategies and its application to the modulation of <b>scavenger</b> receptor function in atherosclerosis...|$|R

40|$|Foam cell {{formation}} via lipid accumulation {{through the}} <b>scavenger</b> receptor in human monocyte/macrophages {{is believed to}} be one of the earliest events in atherogenesis. In this study we demonstrate that stimulation of the <b>scavenger</b> receptor activates monocytes to produce interleukin- 1 (IL- 1). Polyinosinic acid (poly I) and fucoidan, both ligands known to bind to the <b>scavenger</b> receptor, induced IL- 1 beta production in human monocytes. Polycytidylic acid, a structurally related compound to poly I, which does not bind to the <b>scavenger</b> receptor, was used as a negative control and had virtually no effect on IL- 1 production. THP- 1 cells, which normally do not express <b>scavenger</b> receptors, were almost unresponsive to poly I and fucoidan. PMA priming, which has been reported to up-regulate <b>scavenger</b> receptor expression in THP- 1 cells, significantly enhanced IL- 1 production by fucoidan and poly I. IL- 1 produced by <b>scavenger</b> receptor stimulation was shown to be secreted extracellularly, and biologically active. <b>Scavenger</b> receptor-mediated IL- 1 production was inhibited by H 7, a protein kinase C inhibitor, and enhanced by IBMX, an inhibitor of cyclic AMP degradation, suggesting a synergistic effect of protein kinase C and cyclic AMP-mediated signal transduction pathways in <b>scavenger</b> receptor-mediated IL- 1 production. Due to the potentially deleterious effects of IL- 1 on the vessel wall, IL- 1 produced by ligand binding to the <b>scavenger</b> receptor in human monocytes may play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a novel energy <b>scavenger</b> is proposed. The <b>scavenger</b> {{consists}} of a cantilever beam on which piezoelectric films and a mass are mounted.

5|$|Among pterodactyloids {{a greater}} {{variation}} in diet is present. Pteranodontia contained many piscivorous taxa, such as ornithocheirans, boreopterids, pteranodontids and nyctosaurids. Some amount of niche partitioning {{seems to have}} been present: ornithocheirans and the later nyctosaurs were aerial dip-feeders like today's frigatebirds, while boreopterids were freshwater diving animals similar to cormorants or Platanista river dolphins, and pteranodonts were pelagic plunge-divers akin to boobies and gannets. The biggest exception among this group are the istiodactylids, which were likely primarily <b>scavengers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Captive crickets are omnivorous; when {{deprived}} of their natural diet, they accept {{a wide range of}} organic foodstuffs.

40|$|<b>Scavenger</b> receptors {{constitute}} {{a large family}} of proteins that are structurally diverse and participate {{in a wide range}} of biological functions. These receptors are ex-pressed predominantly by myeloid cells and recognize a variety of ligands, including endogenous and modified host-derived molecules and microbial pathogens. There are currently eight classes of <b>scavenger</b> receptors, many of which have multiple names, leading to inconsistencies and confusion in the literature. To address this problem, a workshop was organized by the U. S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health to help develop a clear definition of <b>scavenger</b> receptors and a standardized nomenclature based on that definition. Fifteen experts in the <b>scavenger</b> receptor field attended the workshop and, after extensive discussion, reached a consensus regarding the definition of <b>scavenger</b> receptors and a proposed <b>scavenger</b> receptor nomencla-ture. <b>Scavenger</b> receptors were defined as cell surface receptors that typically bind multiple ligands and pro-mote the removal of non-self or altered-self targets. They often function by mechanisms that include endocytosis, phagocytosis, adhesion, and signaling that ultimately lead to the elimination of degraded or harmful substances. Based on this definition, nomenclature and classification of these receptors into 10 classes were proposed. The discussion and nomenclature recommendations described in this report only refer to mammalian <b>scavenger</b> recep-tors. The purpose of this article is to describe the proposed mammalian nomenclature and classification developed at the workshop and to solicit additional feedback from the broader research community.
