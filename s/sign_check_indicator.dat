40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a Self-Interest-Driven (SID) {{incentive}} scheme to stimulate cooperation among selfish nodes for ad dissemination in autonomous mobile social networks. As a key innovation of SID, we introduce “virtual checks” {{to eliminate the}} needs of accurate knowledge about whom and how many credits ad provider should pay. A virtual check is included in each ad packet. When an intended receiver receives the packet {{for the first time}} from an intermediate node, the former authorizes the latter a digitally <b>signed</b> <b>check,</b> which serves as a proof of successful ad delivery. Multiple copies of a virtual check can be created and signed by different receivers. When a node that owns a <b>signed</b> <b>check</b> meets the ad provider, it requests the provider to cash the check. Both ad packets and <b>signed</b> <b>checks</b> can be traded among mobile nodes. We propose the effective mechanisms to define virtual rewards for ad packets and virtual checks, and formulate the nodal interaction as a twoplayer cooperative game, whose solution is obtained by the Nash Bargaining Theorem. Extensive simulations are carried out to compare SID with other existing incentive algorithms under real world mobility traces. I...|$|R

The Standard can be applied through a benchmarking process to achieve third part auditing of environmental performance. Research work to develop the Standard has involved bringing together the art of the design with the science of environmental management to create a Standard which is not only consistent with the early stages of design but also addresses Agenda 21 issues and Earth <b>Check</b> <b>indicators.</b> Furthermore through a third party assessment program the Standard can be administered with minimal cost to the design team and the developer. A cost effective approach has been devised which works with the quality management (ISO 9000) process used by design offices to facilitate an ease of integration in practice.

Varzaly served as treasurer for the new diocese.

This sparked controversy and lawsuits, but Varzaly prevailed in each.|$|R
