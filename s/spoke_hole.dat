50|$|Aluminum rims {{are often}} {{reinforced}} with either single eyelets or double eyelets {{to distribute the}} stress of the spoke. A single eyelet reinforces the <b>spoke</b> <b>hole</b> much like a hollow rivet. A double eyelet is a cup that is riveted into both walls of a double-walled rim.|$|E
50|$|One {{end of each}} spoke is {{threaded}} for a specialized nut, called a nipple, {{which is used to}} connect the spoke to the rim and adjust the tension in the spoke. This is normally at the rim end. The hub end normally has a 90 degree bend to pass through the <b>spoke</b> <b>hole</b> in the hub, and a head so it does not slip through the hole.|$|E

50|$|Some cyclists {{have avoided}} the price premium for a {{tubeless}} system by sealing the <b>spoke</b> <b>holes</b> {{with a special}} rim strip and then sealing the valve stem and bead seat with a latex sealer. However, tires not designed for tubeless application do not have as robust a sidewall as those that are.|$|R
50|$|The {{downside}} to having very wide rims is that trials rims are heavy compared to narrower rims. To save weight trials rims almost always have large holes through them between each <b>spoke</b> <b>hole</b> to save weight. To stop the tube from bulging {{through the holes}} when the tyre is inflated, a heavy plastic rim strip is used to cover the holes. The pressure in the tube will bulge the rim strip a small amount towards {{the centre of the}} wheel, but this will not lead to a tube failure.|$|E
50|$|A {{tubeless}} {{bicycle tire}} system requires a compatible tire, an airtight rim — {{capable of being}} sealed at the valve stem, <b>spoke</b> <b>holes</b> (if they {{go all the way}} through the rim) and the tire bead seat. The main benefit of tubeless tires is the ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats because there is no tube to pinch between the rim and an obstacle.|$|R
50|$|On {{traditionally}} spoked wheels, {{flange spacing}} affects the lateral stiffness {{of the wheel}}, with wider being stiffer, and flange diameter affects the torsional stiffness of the wheel {{and the number of}} <b>spoke</b> <b>holes</b> that the hub can accept, with larger diameter being stiffer and accepting more holes. Asymmetrical flange diameters, tried to mitigate the adverse effects of asymmetrical spacing and dish necessary on rear wheels with many sprockets, have also been used with modest benefits.|$|R
5000|$|Most bicycle rims are [...] "{{clincher}}" [...] rims for {{use with}} clincher tires. These tires have a wire or aramid (Kevlar or Twaron) fiber bead that interlocks with flanges in the rim. A separate airtight inner tube enclosed by the rim supports the tire carcass and maintains the bead lock. If the inner part of the rim where the inner tube fits has <b>spoke</b> <b>holes,</b> they must be covered by a rim tape or strip, usually rubber, cloth, or tough plastic, to protect the inner tube.|$|R
50|$|A {{tubeless}} tire system requires an airtight rim — {{capable of being}} sealed at the valve stem, <b>spoke</b> <b>holes</b> (if they {{go all the way}} through the rim) and the tire bead seat — and a compatible tire.Universal System Tubeless (UST), originally developed by Mavic, Michelin and Hutchinson for mountain bikes is the most common system of {{tubeless tire}}s/rims for bicycles. The main benefit of tubeless tires is the ability to use low air pressure for better traction without getting pinch flats because there is no tube to pinch between the rim and an obstacle.|$|R
50|$|French tire {{manufacturer}} Hutchinson {{has introduced}} a tubeless wheel system, Road Tubeless, that shares many similarities to the UST (Universal System Tubeless) that was developed in conjunction with Mavic and Michelin. Road Tubeless rims, like UST rims, have no <b>spoke</b> <b>holes</b> protruding to the air chamber of the rim. The flange of the Road Tubeless rim {{is similar to the}} hook bead of a standard clincher rim but is contoured to very close tolerances to interlock with a Road Tubeless tire, creating an airtight seal between tire and rim. This system eliminates the need for a rim strip and inner tube.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dishes on}} each side of a wheel are not always equal. The cogset (freewheel or cassette) of a rear wheel and disc brake rotors, if installed, takes up width on the hub, and so the flanges may not be located symmetrically about the center plane of the hub or the bike. Since the rim must be centered, but the hub flanges are not, there is a {{difference}} in dish between the two sides. Such an asymmetrical wheel is called a [...] "dished" [...] wheel. The side of the wheel with less dish has slightly shorter but significantly higher-tensioned spokes than the side with more dish. Several different techniques have been tried to minimize this spoke asymmetry. In addition to modified hub geometry, some rims have off-center <b>spoke</b> <b>holes,</b> and the mounting of common J-bend spokes at the hub flange can be altered [...] "inboard" [...] or [...] "outboard".|$|R
5000|$|... a is {{the angle}} between (1) the radius to a nipple {{hole in the}} rim to which a spoke is attached, and, (2) the radius to the flange <b>hole</b> holding the <b>spoke.</b> The spoke crosses either 1, 2, or 3 oppositely {{pointing}} spokes depending on the lacing design. On the flange, the angle between the radii of adjacent holes is 360°/m (for equally spaced <b>holes).</b> For each <b>spoke</b> crossed, the hub is rotated {{with reference to the}} rim one [...] "angle between adjacent flange holes". Thus, multiplying the [...] "angle between adjacent flange holes" [...] by k gives the angle a. For example, a 32 spoke wheel has 16 spokes per side, 360° divided by 16 equals 22.5°. Multiply 22.5° ("angle between adjacent flange holes") by the number of crossings to get the angle a—if 3-crosses, the 32 spoke wheel has an angle a of 67.5°. Regarding r3: The size of the <b>spoke</b> <b>holes</b> in the flange does not matter for the needed spoke length. This term removes the effect of the hole size. Since the holes are usually small (just over 2 mm in diameter), the effect is small and in practice matters little.|$|R
50|$|The Lakota (Sioux), an {{indigenous}} {{people who live}} in the Black Hills region of South Dakota, <b>spoke</b> of a <b>hole</b> that blew air, a place they consider sacred as the site where they first emerged from the underworld where they had lived before the demiurge creation of the world.|$|R

A third time the ray shone and died away, and lo! her madness left her, and she awoke {{to know that she}} was dying, and that a voice she loved <b>spoke</b> without the <b>hole,</b> saying in hollow accents:-- ...|$|R
60|$|Even as he <b>spoke</b> a <b>hole</b> {{appeared}} in the dirt plastered between the logs, a rifle muzzle protruded, {{and one of the}} Hungry Folk clapped hand to his side and leaped in the air. A second shot, through the lungs, brought him to the ground. Tyee and the rest scattered to either side, out of direct range, and Aab-Waak hastened the men forward with the skins of oil. Avoiding the loopholes, which were making on every side of the igloo, they emptied the skins on the dry drift-logs brought down by the Mandell River from the tree-lands to the south. Ounenk ran forward with a blazing brand, and the flames leaped upward. Many minutes passed, without sign, and they held their weapons ready as the fire gained headway.|$|R
5000|$|Lacing is {{the process}} of {{threading}} <b>spokes</b> through <b>holes</b> in the hub and rim so that they form a spoke pattern. While most manufacturers use the same lacing pattern on both left and right sides of a wheel, it is becoming increasingly common to find specialty wheels with different lacing patterns on each side. A spoke can connect the hub to the rim in a radial fashion, which creates the lightest and most aerodynamic wheel. However, to efficiently transfer torque from the hub to the rim, as with driven wheels or wheels with drum or disc brakes, durability dictates that spokes be mounted at an angle to the hub flange up to a [...] "tangential lacing pattern" [...] to achieve maximum torque capability (but minimum vertical wheel stiffness). Names for various lacing patterns are commonly referenced to the number of spokes that any one spoke crosses. Conventionally laced 36- or 32-spoke wheels are most commonly built as a cross-3 or a cross-2, however other cross-numbers are also possible. The angle at which the spoke interfaces the hub is not solely determined by the cross-number; as spoke count and hub diameter will lead to significantly different spoke angles. For all common tension-spoke wheels with crossed spokes, a torque applied to the hub will result in one half of the spokes - called [...] "leading spokes" [...] tensioned to drive the rim, while other half - [...] "trailing spokes" [...] are tensioned only to counteract the leading spokes. When forward torque is applied (i.e., during acceleration [...] ), the trailing spokes experience a higher tension, while leading spokes are relieved, thus forcing the rim to rotate. While braking, leading spokes tighten and trailing spokes are relieved. The wheel can thus transfer the hub torque in either direction with the least amount of change in spoke tension, allowing the wheel to stay true while torque is applied.|$|R
