50|$|In the 1930s, the LDS Church built Beehive Clothing Mills, {{which was}} {{responsible}} for manufacturing and selling garments. This led to a more standardized design. During this time women's garments were one-piece designs that ended just above the knees and had a cap sleeve. In the 1970s, the first two-piece garment became available and Mormons generally accepted the change. Today, garments are made in both styles {{with a variety of}} different fabrics. Feminine styles are sold with either a rounded or a <b>sweetheart</b> <b>neckline</b> with cap sleeves. Sweetheart necklines usually follow the line of the bra, which is usually worn over the garment. There are also two styles of necklines for men.|$|E
