5|$|The {{game with}} no {{government}} subsidy {{to the domestic}} firm is <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> <b>1</b> on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both {{stay out of the}} market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm will realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two Nash equilibria of this game (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (perhaps because it began product development earlier) the domestic firm will stay out and the foreign firm will enter.|$|E
5|$|When clocked, {{the phase}} {{accumulator}} (PA) creates a modulo-2N sawtooth waveform {{which is then}} converted by the phase-to-amplitude converter (PAC) to a sampled sinusoid, where N {{is the number of}} bits carried in the phase accumulator. N sets the NCO frequency resolution and is normally much larger than the number of bits defining the memory space of the PAC look-up table. If the PAC capacity is 2M, the PA output word must be truncated to M bits as <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> <b>1.</b> However, the truncated bits can be used for interpolation. The truncation of the phase output word does not affect the frequency accuracy but produces a time-varying periodic phase error which is a primary source of spurious products. Another spurious product generation mechanism is finite word length effects of the PAC output (amplitude) word.|$|E

25|$|The {{applicability}} of the Franck–Condon principle in both absorption and fluorescence, along with Kasha's rule leads to an approximate mirror symmetry shown in Figure 2. The vibrational structure of molecules in a cold, sparse gas is most clearly visible due {{to the absence of}} inhomogeneous broadening of the individual transitions. Vibronic transitions are drawn in Figure 2 as narrow, equally spaced Lorentzian lineshapes. Equal spacing between vibrational levels is only the case for the parabolic potential of simple harmonic oscillators, in more realistic potentials, such as those <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> <b>1,</b> energy spacing decreases with increasing vibrational energy. Electronic transitions to and from the lowest vibrational states are often referred to as 0–0 (zero zero) transitions and have the same energy in both absorption and fluorescence.|$|E
25|$|In plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and phototrophic and chemoautotrophic proteobacteria, {{the enzyme}} usually {{consists}} of two types of protein subunit, called the large chain (L, about 55,000 Da) and the small chain (S, about 13,000 Da). The large-chain gene (rbcL) is encoded by the chloroplast DNA in plants. There are typically several related small-chain genes in the nucleus of plant cells, and the small chains are imported to the stromal compartment of chloroplasts from the cytosol by crossing the outer chloroplast membrane. The enzymatically active substrate (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate) binding sites {{are located in the}} large chains that form dimers as <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> <b>1</b> (above, right) in which amino acids from each large chain contribute to the binding sites.

25|$|Nonribosomal peptide {{synthesis}} occurs through distinct modules {{that can}} load {{and extend the}} protein by one amino acid through the amide bond formation at the contact sites of the activating domains. Each module typically consists of an adenylation (A) domain, a peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain, and a condensation (C) or elongation domain. In the A domain, the specific amino acid is activated by converting into an aminoacyl adenylate enzyme complex attached to a 4'phosphopantetheine cofactor by thioesterification The complex is then transferred to the PCP domain with the expulsion of AMP. The PCP domain uses the attached 4'-phosphopantethein prosthetic group to load the growing peptide chain and their precursors. The organization of the modules necessary to biosynthesize Vancomycin is <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>Figure</b> <b>1.</b> In the biosynthesis of Vancomycin, additional modification domains are present, such as the epimerization (E) domain, which isomerizes the amino acid from one stereochemistry to another, and a thioesterase domain (TE) {{is used as a}} catalyst for cyclization and releases of the molecule via a thioesterase scission.|$|E

500|$|The symbols {{most often}} used for {{directional}} couplers are <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>figure</b> <b>1.</b> [...] The symbol may have the coupling factor in dB marked on it. Directional couplers have four ports. [...] Port 1 is the input port where power is applied. [...] Port 3 is the coupled port where {{a portion of the}} power applied to port 1 appears. [...] Port 2 is the transmitted port where the power from port 1 is outputted, less the portion that went to port 3. [...] Directional couplers are frequently symmetrical so there also exists port 4, the isolated port. [...] A portion of the power applied to port 2 will be coupled to port 4. [...] However, the device is not normally used in this mode and port 4 is usually terminated with a matched load (typically 50 ohms). [...] This termination can be internal to the device and port 4 is not accessible to the user. [...] Effectively, this results in a 3-port device, hence the utility of the second symbol for directional couplers in figure 1.Naval Air Warfare Center, p.6-4.1 ...|$|E
500|$|A special link {{could be}} {{included}} in the chain which incorporated an interrupter circuit. [...] The purpose of the interrupter is to rapidly connect and disconnect the circuit so that the normally steady current of the battery is turned into a rapidly varying current. [...] The usual practice in the use of medical electrical batteries was to feed the output of the interrupter to an induction coil in order to increase the voltage applied to the patient by transformer action. [...] In Pulvermacher's patent however, {{there is no mention of}} using induction coils - the Pulvermacher battery could produce large voltages merely by adding more links to the chain. [...] However, the interrupter still had an effect in that an interrupted current produces a stronger sensation of electric shock in the patient than a steady current. [...] A novel feature of Pulvermacher's interrupter was that it was operated by the action of a vibrating spring kept in motion by the movements of the patient without the need for any external input. [...] Interrupters of the time typically had to be hand-cranked by the physician, although there were already some in existence using electro-mechanical automatic interrupters. [...] Later versions of the Pulvermacher chain used clockwork driven interrupters whose rate of interruption could be adjusted so that the rate of shock to the patient could be controlled.

2500|$|CB1 receptors {{are highly}} {{expressed}} in hypothalamic areas which {{are involved in}} central food intake control and feeding behavior. This strongly indicates that the cannabinoid system is directly involved in feeding regulation. These regions are also interconnected with the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, the so-called [...] "reward" [...] system. Therefore, CB1 antagonists might indirectly inhibit the dopamine-mediated rewarding properties of food. Peripheral CB1 receptors {{are located in the}} gastrointestinal (GI) tract, liver and in adipose tissue. In the GI, CB1 receptors are located on nerve terminals in the intestines. Endocannabinoids act at the CB1 receptors to increase hunger and promote feeding and it is speculated that they decrease intestinal peristalsis and gastric emptying.
