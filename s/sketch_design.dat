5|$|After {{preparing}} {{its initial}} <b>sketch</b> <b>design,</b> the Navy contracted Yarrow Admiralty Research Division (Y-ARD) in July 1970 to complete preliminary {{designs for the}} DDLs. As an initial stage, Y-ARD was required to develop sketch designs for six different armament configurations using a common hull. Requests for tender for studies on major sub-components were also issued in 1970, and these were completed by mid-1971.|$|E
5|$|Named {{after the}} Swedish ship {{of the line}} Rättvisan (Justice) which was {{captured}} by the Russians at the Battle of Viborg Bay in 1790, Retvizan was ordered on 2 May 1898 for delivery in thirty months. The detailed <b>sketch</b> <b>design</b> was forwarded {{at the end of}} 1898 to Saint Petersburg for approval and work commenced on the ship around that time, although she was not officially laid down until 29 July 1899 as yard number 300. Construction was delayed by a strike at the shipyard that began in August 1899 and continued until the strike collapsed in early 1900. Other delays were caused by differences between American and Russian shipbuilding techniques and the insistence of the Naval Ministry on approving any design changes even though a Russian commission had been sent to Philadelphia to supervise her construction.|$|E
25|$|Development of {{the ship}} from the Admiralty <b>sketch</b> <b>design</b> was based around the Fairey IIID {{seaplane}} being operated for the RAN by the Royal Australian Air Force's No. 101 Flight. Albatross could carry up to nine aircraft—six active and three in reserve—in three internal hangars; their incorporation inside the ship's hull resulted in an unusually high freeboard in the forward half of the vessel, and forced the propulsion machinery, accommodation, and bridge to all {{be located in the}} aft half. Three recovery cranes were used to manipulate the aircraft. The Faireys were removed from service shortly before Albatross entered service, and were replaced by the Supermarine Seagull Mark III. The Mark IIIs were unsuited for operations aboard Albatross, particularly as the aircraft were not durable enough to withstand catapult launches. Specifications for a new aircraft design were drawn up to the RAN and RAAF, and Supermarine designed the Seagull Mark V (later to be called the Walrus) specifically for Albatross, although the design was later adopted by the Royal Navy. Albatross was removed from seagoing service in 1933, two months before the Mark Vs entered service, although the aircraft were operated from the vessel while she was at anchor. In addition, the new Seagulls were too tall to manoeuvre around inside the hangars, although this problem was worked around by placing the aircraft, with undercarriage retracted, on specially designed trolleys.|$|E

500|$|The DDL design changed {{considerably}} {{over the}} life of the project.

500|$|With the {{approval}} of the specifications, TsKB-17, the heavy-ship design bureau, began work on the <b>sketch</b> <b>design</b> to be submitted for approval to the Council of Ministers {{before the start of the}} technical design could begin. By March 1949, four alternatives had been completed, differing mainly in the arrangement of the 130mm guns and the boiler layout. The bureau preferred one layout and the Navy and the Shipbuilding Ministry concurred so the bureau began the technical design, without formal approval, in order to be ready to lay down the first two ships in the third quarter of 1950 as already scheduled. However, when Stalin reviewed the <b>sketch</b> <b>design</b> in September 1949, he rejected it, ordering a smaller, faster ship capable of [...] TsKB-17 was able to produce a preliminary technical design that met Stalin's demands by the end of the year, an amazingly fast amount of time for what should have been a very involved process. The most likely explanation is that the designers retained as much of their original work as possible and found room for the more powerful turbines and more numerous boilers necessary to attain Stalin's specified speed by deleting the two rear twin 130mm turrets, and their magazines, as revealed by a comparison of the 1949 and 1951 sketches.|$|E

500|$|This was {{approved}} and the detailed design work {{began with the}} basic concept that the ship should be superior to the Scharnhorst-class ships and able to outrun the Bismarck-class battleships. At this time the horizontal protection was revised after full-scale trials revealed that a [...] bomb would penetrate both a [...] upper deck and a [...] middle deck to burst on the main armor deck. So the middle deck was thickened to [...] with the lower deck intended to catch any splinters penetrating the armor deck. This mean that the main belt had to be extended upwards to meet the main armor deck at a significant penalty in weight. The Defense Committee approved the <b>sketch</b> <b>design</b> on 13 July 1939, but the detailed design was not approved until 12 April 1940, after construction had already begun {{on the first two}} ships.|$|E
500|$|Like Hōshō, Hermes {{was based}} on a cruiser-type hull and she was {{initially}} designed to carry both wheeled aircraft and seaplanes. The ship's design was derived from a 1916 seaplane carrier design by Gerard Holmes and Sir John Biles, but was considerably enlarged by Sir Eustace d'Eyncourt, the Director of Naval Construction (DNC), in his April 1917 <b>sketch</b> <b>design.</b> Her most notable feature was the seaplane slipway that comprised three sections. The seaplanes would taxi onto the rigid submerged portion aft and dock with a trolley that would carry the aircraft into the hangar. A flexible submerged portion separated the rear section from the rigid forward portion of the slipway to prevent the submerged part from rolling with the ship's motion. The entire slipway could be retracted into the ship, and a gantry crane ran the length of the slipway to help recover the seaplanes. The design showed two islands with the full-length flight deck running between them. Each island contained one funnel; a large net could be strung between them to stop out-of-control aircraft. Aircraft were transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts (elevators); the forward lift measured [...] and the rear [...] This design displaced [...] and accommodated six large Short Type 184 seaplanes and six smaller Sopwith Baby seaplanes. The ship's armament consisted of six [...] guns.|$|E
500|$|The Soviets {{never did}} get the {{detailed}} data required to redesign the ship's barbettes and magazines, but they did know that the 380-mm barbettes was bigger in diameter {{than that of the}} 305mm turret as well as taller than the Russian turrets. So the barbette of turret number two had to be raised to clear turret number one and the height of the conning tower had to be raised to clear turret number two. Similarly the [...] anti-aircraft guns behind turret number three had to be raised as well. The new turrets required more electrical power which meant that the output of the turbo generators had to be increased to 1,300 kilowatts. All of these changes added over [...] to the ships' displacement and the <b>sketch</b> <b>design</b> was completed by 16 October 1940, as Project 69-I (Importnyi—Imported), even though they still lacked data for the turrets and their barbettes. This was presented to the State Defense Committee on 11 February 1941, but the design was not approved until 10 April when it ordered that the first two ships be completed with German guns while the others would continue to use the 305mm guns. The detailed design was supposed to be completed by 15 October 1941, but it was rendered pointless when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June.|$|E

500|$|The 1896 Naval Expansion Plan {{was made}} after the First Sino-Japanese War, and {{included}} four armored cruisers {{in addition to}} four more battleships, all of {{which had to be}} ordered from overseas shipyards as Japan lacked the capability to build them itself. Further consideration of the Russian building program caused the IJN to believe that the battleships ordered under the original plan would not be sufficient to counter the Imperial Russian Navy. Budgetary limitations prevented ordering more battleships and the IJN decided to expand the number of more affordable armored cruisers to be ordered from four to six ships, believing that the recent introduction of tougher Krupp cemented armor would allow them to stand in the line of battle. The revised plan is commonly known as the [...] "Six-Six Fleet". The first four ships were built by Armstrong Whitworth in the United Kingdom, but the last two ships were built in Germany and France. To ensure ammunition compatibility, the IJN required their builders to use the same British guns as the other four ships. In general, the IJN provided only a <b>sketch</b> <b>design</b> and specifications that each builder had to comply with; otherwise each builder was free to build the ships as they saw fit. Unlike most of their contemporaries which were designed for commerce raiding or to defend colonies and trade routes, Azuma and her half-sisters were intended as fleet scouts and to be employed in the battleline.|$|E
500|$|On 8 January 1941, Rear Admiral Bruce Fraser, Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy {{asked the}} DNC {{to work up}} a hybrid {{aircraft}} carrier based on the Lion-class hull. Two months later, a <b>sketch</b> <b>design</b> was presented for consideration, {{but it was not}} well liked by the participants. This design retained all three main gun turrets and the flight deck was deemed too short to be useful. A revised version with only the two forward turrets retained was requested and was ready in July. In this design, the displacement ranged from [...] at standard load and [...] at deep load. The design's dimensions included a waterline length of , a beam of [...] and a draught of [...] The flight deck was [...] long and had a width of [...] The machinery was unchanged, but [...] of additional oil increased her endurance to [...] at 10 knots. The hybrid's armament consisted of six 16-inch guns in two triple turrets, sixteen 5.25-inch guns and eight octuple 2-pounder mounts. Twelve fighters and two torpedo bombers could be carried. The Director of Naval Gunnery was particularly pungent in his assessment of the design, [...] "The functions and requirements of carriers and of surface gun platforms are entirely incompatible ...the conceptions of these designs ...is evidently the result of an unresolved contest between a conscious acceptance of aircraft and a subconscious desire for a 1914 Fleet ...these abortions are the results of a psychological maladjustment. The necessary readjustments should result from a proper re-analysis of the whole question, what would be a balanced fleet in 1945, 1950 or 1955?" [...] Not surprisingly, the design was rejected.|$|E
