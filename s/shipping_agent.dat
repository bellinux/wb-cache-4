In March 1924, she completed her 50th voyage on that route.

40|$|The article {{presents}} structural changes in liner shipping sector, as many global Container shipping lines are opening their own agencies and many independent <b>shipping</b> <b>agents</b> are consecutively closing down their activities, either via takeovers or by {{going out of}} business completely. The process of horizontal and vertical integration in shipping industry is re-shaping the entire logistics industry. Such changes put pressure on <b>shipping</b> <b>agents</b> to redefine their market role and develop services with added quality, and relationships with actual and new principals. They are forced to seek for new ways to make income therefore they are forced to perform additional roles, in order to satisfy carriers on one hand, and usually just a few clients, on the other. A market analysis in Slovenia has been performed among companies offering ship-port services, with focus on comparison between independent agents and Container Line offices. It has been ascertained that independent <b>shipping</b> <b>agents</b> must implement the new strategy which is closer to a forwarder’s mentality and market role...|$|R

25|$|Pier 55, at {{the foot}} of Spring Street, was {{originally}} named Pier 4. The first Pier 4, built in 1900, collapsed in September 1901, causing the loss of at least 1700 tons of freight. No one was killed in the accident, and the following year the Northern Pacific Railroad completed a new Pier 4, this time with better bracing, which survives today as the renamed Pier 55. Its first tenant, the Arlington Dock Company, was a <b>shipping</b> <b>agent</b> for passenger steamships to several West Coast cities and to Alaska, Asia and Europe. The pier was used for passenger service until around World War I. The Fisheries Supply Company became the principal tenant from at least 1938 to the 1980s. In 1945, the pier was remodeled. Structural improvements were made at that time by Melvin O. Sylliaasen and in the 1960s by the engineering firm Harvey Dodd and Associates.

Maria gave Thomas considerable support and encouragement throughout his career.

Thomas' work led to frequent moves of home in their early years; from Birkenhead to Stafford, Kingston upon Thames, Winchester and then Fareham. On each occasion Maria supervised the packing of their possessions and the removal. The Harrison children had been taught to speak French, while Thomas himself was unable to do so. Therefore, when the opportunity arose to apply for the French contracts, Maria was willing to act as interpreter and encouraged Thomas to bid for them. This resulted in moves to Vernon in Normandy, then to Rouen, on to Paris and back again to Rouen. Thomas refused to learn French and Maria acted as interpreter for all his French undertakings. Maria organised the education of their three sons. In time the family established a more-or-less permanent base in Lowndes Square, Belgravia, London.

500|$|Steamboats {{began to}} see strong {{competition}} from the railroads after the post-Civil War replacement of the rail lines, and after a brief episode of poor health in 1870, Hinde sold his interests in the river navigation business and {{turned his attention to}} railroads. He went to Louisville, Kentucky, to rest, and by chance became a <b>shipping</b> <b>agent</b> for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company through his close relationship with several company executives. Hinde secured various contracts for hauling grain, a business he may have gained some insight into from his brother Edmund C. Hinde (1830–1909), who was then active in the grain business in their hometown of Mount Carmel. But the endeavor was unsuccessful, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad went into receivership; Hinde arranged to have all his shipments transferred to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Company. Shortly before he received an invitation from E. S. Babcock to move to Coronado, California, Hinde's only child, Camilla, died in Evansville at the age of 13. Babcock had founded the Hotel del Coronado and several large companies, and invited Hinde to invest and help manage his business interests. [...] Hinde had been engaged in the railroad business for a little under a decade when he left for southern California to invest with John Diedrich Spreckels and E.S. Babcock in the real estate and hotel businesses. [...] In the following years, Hinde and Spreckels launched numerous successful business ventures together and became good friends.|$|E
50|$|The near-monopoly {{position}} of the Lombards in finance became less prominent as various Protestant factions after the Reformation.
