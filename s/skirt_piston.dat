Initially, many people were disappointed because the first TRX450R was very weak compared to the CRF450R. Honda claims that it designed the TRX450R engine to produce more torque so that the engine was more suited for ATV purposes. In 2004 and 2005, the only interchangeable part between the ATV and motorcycle engines was the camshaft. In 2006, Honda overhauled the TRX450R engine to make it more similar to its motorcycle variant. This included a more aggressive cam profile, a larger bore with a shortened stroke, a new, short <b>skirt</b> <b>piston</b> and titanium rather than steel valves. In addition, Honda changed the carburetor from a 42 mm Keihin butterfly type to a 40 mm Keihin FCR. This increased the power from about [...] in the first generation to over [...] in the second.

40|$|The recent {{worldwide}} {{quest to}} increase the fuel efficiency of internal combustion engines has led to great effects to reduce friction {{of many of the}} components in these engines. One area of major concern pertaining to this area is the friction of the piston/ring pack assembly. Because of the importance and necessity of this component to the internal combustion engine, any improvements can have relatively large implications for friction reduction. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate several key components of the piston/ring pack assembly and how they influence friction levels. Specifically, experimental friction trends related to the oil control ring, <b>piston</b> <b>skirt,</b> liner surface and lubricant will be discussed. The Floating Liner Engine is used in this study in both the motored and fired configuration to isolate results from components and provide data for comparative analysis. The oil control ring (OCR) controls the supply of lubricating oil to the top two rings of the ring pack and has a significant contribution to friction of the system. This study investigates the two most prevalent types of OCR in the automotive market: the twin land oil control ring (TLOCR) and three piece oil control ring (TPOCR). The effect of changing the land width and spring tension on different liner surfaces for the TLOCR is investigated, and distinct trends are identified. A comparison is then done between the TLOCR and TPOCR on different liner surfaces. Results showed the TPOCR displayed different patterns of friction compared the TLOCR in certain cases. The <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> is also an important contributor of friction in the piston assembly. This thesis discusses the investigation into low friction coatings on the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt.</b> A brief study of <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> patterns is presented, with little gains being made by applying patterns the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> coating. Next the roughness of the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> coating is analyzed, and results show that reducing <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> roughness can have positive effects on friction reduction. Finally, an introductory study into the profile of the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> is presented, with the outcome being that friction reduction is possible by optimizing the skirt profile. The final section of this thesis discusses the effects of lubricants pertaining to friction in the piston assembly. The effects of changing lubricant viscosity through both temperature and formulation are presented, as well as results from testing the effects of select anti-wear additives in the oil. The results identify new developments related to lubricant/additive effects on the liner surface, and how these effects can influence friction. by Zach Westerfield. Thesis: S.

40|$|Ever-increasing {{demand for}} {{reduction}} of the undesirable emissions from the internal combustion engines propels broader effort in auto industry to design more fuel efficient engines. One of the major focuses is the reduction of engine mechanical losses, to which the friction of the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> is one important contributor. Yet there lacks a sufficient understanding of the skirt lubrication behavior to effectively optimize the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> system in practice. The ultimate goal of this work {{is to develop a}} comprehensive model to advance the predictability of the skirt friction while integrating all the dynamic behavior of the piston secondary motion and the structural deformation of the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> and cylinder liner. Major contributions of this work are analysis of and development of a model for the oil transport and exchange of the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> region and its surroundings. The new oil transport model is composed with two elements. First, the oil scraped into the chamfer region by the oil control ring during a down-stroke is tracked and its accumulation and release to the skirt region are modeled. Second, oil separation and re-attachment are allowed in the skirt region, breaking conventional full-attachment assumption in lubrication studies. The new oil transport model together with hydrodynamic and boundary lubrication model were coupled with piston secondary motion and structural deformation of the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> and cylinder liner. For numerical efficiency and physics clarity, we used different discretization for the lubrication from the structural deformation. The final model is robust and efficient. The discussion of the model results is focused mainly on the oil transport. There exist a general pattern in available oil for skirt lubrication, namely, skirt tends to be starved when it travels at the upper portion of a stroke. Comparison with visualization experiment for oil accumulation patterns show consistency between model prediction and observation. This work represents a major step forward to realistically predicting skirt friction and the influence of all the relevant design and operational parameters. However, oil supply to the region below the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> can largely influence the outcome of the friction prediction and its mechanism is system dependent. Additionally, simple treatment of the oil transport in the current model is merely a first step to modeling the complex fluid problems involved. Improvements of this model based on application and further analysis will make it a more powerful engineering tool to optimize the skirt system to minimize its undesirable outputs. by Dongfang Bai.

40|$|The piston–cylinder {{conjunction}} {{accounts for}} nearly 50 % {{of all the}} parasitic frictional losses in an IC engine of which the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> accounts for nearly half of these losses. Consequently, part-circumferential short <b>skirted</b> compliant <b>pistons</b> have become a development trend, particularly for high-performance engines. Another trend has been the use of light weight moving parts to reduce inertial imbalance. This {{has led to the}} use of shorter lighter pistons constructed from lower density materials, such as aluminium. These higher power density pistons typically operate at elevated temperatures and undergo significant mechanical and thermal distortions due to the relatively high thermal expansion coefficients. As a result thermo-mechanical distortion of the skirt {{plays an important role in}} controlling the clearance gap between the skirt and the liner and makes the analysis, particularly skirt deformation, a computationally intensive procedure. This paper presents a semi-automatic methodology for the prediction of <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> thermo-mechanical deflection, which incorporates skirt deformation as well as piston crown compliant contribution to the skirt–liner clearance. This procedure is based on the creation of a compliance matrix and its intricate manipulation, significantly reducing the simulation run times. Integration of this approach with the numerical solution of Reynolds equation leads to an accurate prediction of film thickness. In addition, an array of ultrasonic sensors is used to directly measure the conjunctional lubricant film thickness in a non-invasive manner.

40|$|The {{automobile}} manufacturers aspire {{to improve the}} engine design and enhance its life apart from optimizing the energy usage in the actual engine operation. A major concern {{at the time of}} the initial start up at the low loads and speed conditions is the wear of an engine. A significant proportion of the engine life gets compromised due to the adhesive engine start up wear. The start up wear does not exist during the normal engine operation due to the fully established elastohydrodynamic lubricating (EHL) film between the interacting surfaces of the piston assembly and the cylinder liner at the high loads, speeds and the optimum piston-to-bore radial clearances. Such arrangements do not exist in a few initial engine start up cycles. Resultantly, the <b>piston</b> <b>skirts</b> and the 1 st compression ring establish a physical contact with the liner and adhesive wear occurs. This PhD research work numerically models the lubrication of the <b>piston</b> <b>skirts</b> and the 1 st compression ring in the initial engine start up.

50|$|A slipper piston is a piston for a {{petrol engine}} {{that has been}} reduced in size and weight as much as possible.

The sides of the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> around the gudgeon pin are reduced away from the cylinder wall. The purpose is mostly to reduce the reciprocating mass, thus {{making it easier to}} balance the engine and so permit high speeds. Reduced inertia also improves mechanical efficiency of the engine: the forces required to accelerate and decelerate the reciprocating parts cause more piston friction with the cylinder wall than the fluid pressure on the piston head. A secondary benefit may be some reduction in friction with the cylinder wall, since the area of the skirt, which slides {{up and down in the}} cylinder is reduced by half.
