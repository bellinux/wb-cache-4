5|$|With this tour, I'm {{going to}} be working on some {{different}} arrangements for some of the older <b>songs,</b> <b>to...</b> give it a little more life to them. That's not to say they're going to sound totally different and to freak anybody out... I love re-singing <b>songs</b> <b>to</b> different music. I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs mean so much to me, this time of my life has been so wonderful for me, and I want to experience that with my fans.|$|E

5|$|In April 2015, Activision {{announced}} a new entry in the series, titled Guitar Hero Live. The title was developed by Activision's internal studio FreeStyleGames, who previously had worked on the DJ Hero spinoff titles. FreeStyleGames were given free rein to reboot the Guitar Hero series for next-generation consoles. One of their first innovations was to drop the standard five-button guitar controller, ultimately designing a six-button guitar controller, with two rows of three buttons each, allowing them to mimic actual guitar fingering. Guitar Hero Live was released with both a career and an online mode. The career mode used full-motion video taken {{from the perspective of}} a lead guitarist underneath the note highway, to create an immersive experience to the player. The online mode, called GHTV, discarded the previous downloadable content approach and used a music video channel approach to stream playable <b>songs</b> <b>to</b> players, adding new <b>songs</b> <b>to</b> the catalog on a weekly basis. The game was released in October 2015.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{following}} his parents wishes {{and looking for}} a job, it is said that Ramprasad devoted most of his time to sadhana. Ramram died before he could make provisions to support the family. Forced finally by poverty, Ramprasad moved to Kolkata and worked as an accountant in the household of Durga Charan Mitra for a monthly salary of thirty rupees. According to traditional accounts, during his employment Ramprasad would write devotional <b>songs</b> <b>to</b> Kali. His fellow employees were appalled to see Ramprasad write poems in his account book, and reported him to their employer. Durga Charan Mitra, upon reading Ramprasad's work, was moved by his piety and literary skill. Instead of dismissing Ramprasad from work, he asked him to return to his village and compose <b>songs</b> <b>to</b> Kali, while continuing to pay his salary.|$|E

5|$|Severing {{professional}} {{ties with}} father and manager Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé eschewed {{the music of}} her previous releases {{in favor of an}} intimate, personal album. 4s lyrics emphasize monogamy, female empowerment and self-reflection, a result of Beyoncé considering a maturer message to contend artistic credibility. In May 2011, Beyoncé submitted seventy-two <b>songs</b> <b>to</b> Columbia Records for consideration, twelve of which appeared on the standard edition.|$|E

5|$|The band is {{organized}} quite simply with Paul and Joe playing their songs {{in a simple}} basic guitar-synth-and-drums indie pop style and they sing in the semi-deadpan way; a review found the vocal delivery {{similar to that of}} They Might Be Giants. The raison d’être of the band is to put enough energy and spirit into their <b>songs</b> <b>to</b> make them fun.|$|E
5|$|The {{music on}} Kaleidoscope Dream draws on R, pop, funk, rock and soul styles, {{as well as}} {{elements}} from electronic and psychedelic music. The album's producers incorporated dense bass lines, buzzing synthesizers, and hazy, reverbed sounds in the songs, which deal mostly with sex, romance, and existential ideas. Miguel titled Kaleidoscope Dream {{as a metaphor for}} life and wanted the <b>songs</b> <b>to</b> reflect his lifestyle and personality.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to his village, Ramprasad {{spent most of his}} time in sadhana, meditation, and prayer. Traditional accounts tell of several esoteric sadhanas that he performed, including standing neck-deep in the river Ganges, singing <b>songs</b> <b>to</b> Kali. Ramprasad would regularly practice his sadhana in a panchavati: a grove with five trees—banyan, bael, amalaki, ashoka, and peepul—all regarded as holy in Tantric tradition. He would reportedly spend hours meditating on a panchamundi asana (an altar inside which are interred five skulls–that of a snake, frog, rabbit, fox, and man). According to popular stories he had a vision of Kali in her form of Adyashakti Mahamaya.|$|E
5|$|As the band's main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor was {{considered}} the only constant member and creative force within the group through much of its history. However, this changed in 2016 when Atticus Ross was introduced as a permanent member of Nine Inch Nails, alongside {{the announcement of the}} Not the Actual Events EP. Furthermore, Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him onstage. These touring bands comprise a revolving lineup, and often rearrange <b>songs</b> <b>to</b> fit a live setting. Nine Inch Nails often employs thematic visual elements to accompany on stage performances as well, which frequently include elaborate light shows.|$|E
