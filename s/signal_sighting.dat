Still, he maintained a brave front, and once again his cheery words, and unfeigned good temper, and the example set them by the aged doge, had their effect; but the soldiers required a pledge that, if Zeno should not be <b>signalled</b> in <b>sight</b> by New Year's Day, he would raise the siege.

50|$|The Wath to Penistone {{section was}} the first to be energised, on 2 February 1952.

On 30 May 1954 electric trains began running through the tunnel and the Manchester to Penistone section was fully energised on 14 June. The Sheffield Victoria to Penistone section followed on 20 September 1954.

5000|$|In early May, Taiyō Maru was requisitioned by the Imperial Japanese Army as a {{auxiliary}} transport. Her {{first and}} only assignment was to transport 34 soldiers and 1010 civilians, including military governors, doctors, bureaucracy staff, educators and technicians needed to administer conquered Southeast Asian regions. The passengers included {{a large number of}} oil field technicians bound for the Palembang, Sumatra and to revive oil refining facilities at Miri in Sarawak and Balikpapan, Borneo, as well as technicians for Malaya and for Java to install new equipment in the aluminum refinery facility and to construct a cement factory at Davao, Philippines. She was also loaded with 2,450 tons of war materiel including ammunition, hand grenades, and 150 tons of calcium carbide. She departed for Singapore on 7 May as part of a convoy including Yoshino Maru, three other cargo ships and an auxiliary gunboat. Although Taiyo Maru was capable of more than 14 knots, she was limited to 8 knots by the speed of the slowest member of the convoy, and progress was further hampered by gale force winds. On 8 May, the escorting auxiliary gunboat Peking Maru <b>signalled</b> <b>sighting</b> a submarine, and the crew went to battle stations. Around this time, most of the passengers were at their evening meal. At 1945 hours, Taiyō Maru is struck portside stern by two torpedoes fired by [...] One torpedo hit the No.2 hold, causing the calcium carbide stored there to catch fire and explode. Likewise, the cargo of ammunition and hand grenades exploded, blowing out the bottom of the vessel. The passengers rushed to the 18 lifeboats, only to find the deck on fire and most of the lifeboats destroyed by the explosions. By 2020, the water reached C deck and by 2035, the ship started to submerge bow first. Captain Keisuke Harada and about a dozen crewmen decided to go down with the ship which sank at 2040 hours approximately 170 km southwest of of Me-shima in the Danjo Islands.|$|R

40|$|In congenitally blind individuals, {{many regions}} {{of the brain that}} are {{typically}} heavily involved in visual processing are recruited for a variety of nonvisual sensory and cognitive tasks (Rauschecker 1995; Pascual-Leone et al. 2005). This phenomenon—cross-modal plasticity—has been widely documented, but the principles that de-termine where and how cross-modal changes occur remain poorly understood (Bavelier and Neville 2002). Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that cross-modal plasticity respects the type of compu-tations performed by a region, even as it changes the modality of the inputs over which they are carried out (Pascual-Leone and Hamilton 2001). We compared the fMRI <b>signal</b> in <b>sighted</b> and con-genitally blind participants during proprioceptively guided reaching. We show that parietooccipital reach-related regions retain their functional role—encoding of the spatial position of the reach target —even as the dominant modality in this region changes from visual to nonvisual inputs. This suggests that the computational role of a region, independently of the processing modality, codetermines its potential cross-modal recruitment. Our findings demonstrate that preservation of functional properties can serve as a guiding prin-ciple for cross-modal plasticity even in visuomotor cortical regions, i. e. beyond the early visual cortex and other traditional visual areas...|$|R
50|$|In {{considering}} the natural behaviours of specific breeds of dogs, {{it is possible}} to train them to perform specialised, highly useful, tasks. For example, Labrador retrievers are the favoured breed for the detection of explosives. This is because of a combination of factors including their food drive which enables them to keep focused on a task despite noise and other distractions. Most working breeds of dogs are able to be trained to find people with their sense of smell (as opposed to their sense of sight). Cocker Spaniels are able to be trained as part of a termite detection team. Their relatively small size enables them to fit into small spaces, and their light weight allows them to walk on areas of ceiling which would be dangerous to anything heavier. In fact, although unusual, termite detection dogs are much more reliable at detecting termites than humans who rely on a basic system of tapping and listening. Because of their ability to learn <b>signals</b> by <b>sight</b> and for their energetic and athletic natures, German Shepherds are able to be trained for work alongside search and rescue teams and human apprehension teams.|$|R

In this paper, the effect of reflection and scattering due to the presence of such objects is studied with respect to the capacity of a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) wireless system. The carried out investigations are performed by applying a simple electromagnetic model, in which transmitting and receiving antennas of MIMO system, as well as signal blocking objects, are represented by wire dipoles. In order to provide a fair assessment, calculations of MIMO capacity are performed under both fixed transmitted power and fixed received power conditions...|$|R
