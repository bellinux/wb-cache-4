25|$|Gordon Holmes Alexander MacMillan {{was born}} near Bangalore, Kingdom of Mysore, India, on 7 January 1897. His father, Dugald MacMillan, was a coffee {{plantation}} owner. However, {{when he was}} three years old, his parents, both of Scottish origin, {{decided to return to}} Britain to bring up their only son. At the age of ten, he joined St Edmund's School, Canterbury, from where he won a Prize Cadetship to attend a <b>shortened</b> <b>course</b> at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in April 1915, during the Great War.|$|E
25|$|Education as Rettungsassistent {{was mostly}} offered by privately owned but state {{certified}} EMS schools (Rettungsassistenten-Schule). Mostly {{the students had}} to pay for their own training, rarely a future employer paid. Usual exceptions were firefighters, policemen and members of the armed forces for whom their employer covered the fees. Costs depended on school, they varied around €4000 for a full course. With a pre-existing EMS training, a <b>shortened</b> <b>course</b> was available, for fees of about €2750. Side entry for nurses were possible, omitting several medical topics, remaining fees of about €1800. Public funding and sponsorship were possible in certain cases.|$|E
25|$|Cassels {{served in}} the Second World War, where he {{attended}} a <b>shortened</b> <b>course</b> at the Staff College, Camberley. In May 1940 he then became a brigade major with a Territorial Army (TA) unit, the 157th Infantry Brigade, part of the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, which was sent to France in June 1940 to bolster the French Army {{in the aftermath of}} the British Expeditionary Force's (BEF) evacuation from Dunkirk. Cassel's brigade, the first of the 52nd Division's brigades to arrive in France, was, soon after its arrival, ordered to form the right of the French Tenth Army at Conches, Normandy. However, the situation was considered to be hopeless and Cassel's brigade was later withdrawn through Cherbourg on 18 June. The French signed the second armistice of Compiègne just days later.|$|E
25|$|Specific side entries with <b>shortened</b> <b>courses</b> {{were defined}} for {{applicants}} with existing Rettungssanitäter education, nurses, active soldiers {{and police officers}} with medical training. Another professional education could have been accredited by authorities in general.|$|R

2500|$|From Wellington he then {{entered the}} Royal Military College, Sandhurst in December 1915 and, after {{attending}} a <b>shortened</b> <b>course</b> for the war, was commissioned {{as a second}} lieutenant into his father's regiment, the Royal Irish Fusiliers, on 16 August 1916, just under a month before his 18th birthday. In contrast to his time at Wellington, Templer greatly enjoyed Sandhurst, and later wrote with amusement that he [...] "was a completely undistinguished cadet from every {{point of view and}} passed out – nobody failed at that stage of the First World War because we were so badly needed as cannon fodder – in July 1916, a couple of months before my eighteenth birthday". Due to his age, however, he was unable to serve overseas and was sent to the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion in Buncrana, County Donegal in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Midwifery {{training}} {{is similar in}} length and structure, but is sufficiently different {{that it is not}} considered a branch of nursing. There are shortened (18 month) programs to allow nurses already qualified in the adult branch to hold dual registration as a nurse and a midwife. <b>Shortened</b> <b>courses</b> lasting 2 years also exist for graduates of other disciplines to train as nurses. This is achieved by more intense study and a shortening of the common foundation program.|$|R

2500|$|Jumper {{classes are}} held over {{a course of}} show jumping obstacles, {{including}} verticals, spreads, and double and triple combinations, usually with many turns and changes of direction. The intent is to jump cleanly over a set course within an allotted time. Time faults are assessed for exceeding the time allowance. Jumping faults are incurred for knockdowns and blatant disobedience, such as refusals (when the horse stops before a fence or [...] "runs out") (see [...] "Modern rules" [...] below). Horses are allowed {{a limited number of}} refusals before being disqualified. A refusal may lead to a rider exceeding the time allowed on course. Placings are based on the lowest number of points or [...] "faults" [...] accumulated. A horse and rider who have not accumulated any jumping faults or penalty points are said to have scored a [...] "clear round". Tied entries usually have a jump-off over a raised and <b>shortened</b> <b>course,</b> and the course is timed; if entries are tied for faults accumulated in the jump-off, the fastest time wins.|$|E

25|$|The RAF Staff College {{was founded}} at RAF Andover on 1 April 1922, to provide staff {{training}} to selected officers, usually of Flight Lieutenant or Squadron Leader rank {{to enable them}} to undertake staff officer duties at the Air Ministry, and Command or Group HQs. It was closed on the day that Britain declared war, 3 September 1939. But in November 1939, <b>shortened</b> <b>courses</b> were restarted until the College was placed under Care and Maintenance on 28 May 1940. The Staff College re-opened at Bulstrode Park in December 1941, the College returning to Andover in 1948. It was raised to Group status within Training Command on 1 June 1968 and eventually moved to Bracknell in 1970.|$|R

40|$|AbstractEmergence of multidrug {{resistance}} and decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility (DCS) in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi in South Asia have rendered older drugs, including ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim–sulphamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin, ineffective or suboptimal for typhoid fever. Ideally, treatment should {{be safe and}} available for adults and children in <b>shortened</b> <b>courses</b> of 5 days, cause defervescence within 1 week, render blood and stool cultures sterile, and prevent relapse. In this review of 20 prospective clinical trials that enrolled more than 1600 culture-proven patients, azithromycin meets these criteria better than other drugs. Among fluoroquinolones, which are more effective than cephalosporins, gatifloxacin {{appears to be more}} effective than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for patients infected with bacteria showing DCS. Ceftriaxone continues to be useful as a back-up choice, and chloramphenicol, despite its toxicity for bone marrow and history of plasmid-mediated resistance, is making a comeback in developing countries that show their bacteria to be susceptible to it...|$|R
40|$|Genotypes 2 and 3 (G 2 /G 3) of {{hepatitis}} C virus have been lumped together as ‘easy to treat’. As a result, guidelines recommend 24 weeks of peginterferon/ribavirin for both. However, {{a closer look}} at trials shows that these genotypes are not the same, with G 2 infection proving more responsive to peginterferon. The data supporting this conclusion are presented along with possible explanations for the differences observed. Ultimately, decisions must be made about therapy. Rapid virological response (RVR) may be the best parameter predicting successful antiviral therapy. For patients with G 2 infection who achieve an RVR, <b>shortened</b> <b>courses</b> of therapy are effective. In contrast, for G 3 patients without an RVR, there may be benefit to extending therapy to 48 weeks; however, this requires confirmation in prospective studies. Using RVR to guide therapy may level the playing field between these ‘easy to treat’ genotypes...|$|R

40|$|Inappropriate use of {{antibiotics}} in patients without bacterial infection contributes significantly to worldwide antibiotic resistance. - The goal of this review is to summarise evidence from randomised trials investigating {{the value of the}} biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) in patients with symptoms of a bacterial infection in the emergency department (ED) and intensive care (IC). - In patients with a lower respiratory infection in the ED, RCTs demonstrate that withholding or shortening of antibiotic treatment in patients with low PCT levels does not lead to a change in clinical outcome. Similar results were observed in IC patients, where a reduction in PCT level indicates that antibiotics can be discontinued sooner. - In conclusion, initiating and discontinuing antibiotics in ED and IC patients based on PCT levels is safe, appears cost-saving and leads to a reduction in antibiotic use due to fewer antibiotics prescriptions and <b>shortened</b> <b>courses...</b>|$|R
40|$|A recent {{randomized}} controlled trial {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of a fixed, short antimicrobial treatment was published in May of this year (1). This interesting study brings to the fore the importance of evaluating, with proper methodology, {{one of the most}} disputable aspects of antimicrobial treatments, the duration. When supported by strong evidence or expert statements, <b>shortening</b> <b>courses</b> of anti-microbial treatments are an important component of antimicrobial stewardship programs (2). The course of therapy must be defined as the time period during which therapeutic concentrations are main-tained at the site of infection, instead of the time during which an antimicrobial treatment is administered. This definition puts emphasis on the importance of a thorough evaluation before starting a short treatment. For example, the most recent Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) skin and soft tissue guidelines suggest a treatment as short as five days for cellulitis (3). This duration might not apply to a patient with cellulitis and chronic arterial insufficiency of the lowe...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} series of 30 {{consecutive}} patients with 31 infected total hip arthroplasties treated by a single surgeon over a 4 -year period in whom a <b>shortened</b> post-operative <b>course</b> of antimicrobial chemotherapy was used. The treatment protocol consisted of a two-stage exchange with removal of infected components, insertion of an interim antibiotic eluting cement spacer and re-implantation of an extensively coated uncemented prosthesis on the femoral side. Systemic antibiotic treatment following each stage consisted of an abridged course of 5 days post-operative intra-venous administration followed by complete cessation of anti-microbial therapy. At a mean follow-up of 35 months (minimum 24 months), there were no cases of recurrent prosthetic infection and no patient had required revision for aseptic loosening or mechanical instability on the femoral side. The combination of effective-staged surgical joint debridement, a <b>shortened</b> post-operative <b>course</b> of systemic antibiotic treatment and an adequate latent period before re-implantation has led to encourage early results in this series of revised chronic hip joint prosthetic infections...|$|R
