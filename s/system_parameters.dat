A finite element model using distributed stiffness parameter is utilized instead of the lumped parameter.

We then design two hybrid feedback control methods to achieve the lag synchronization including the linear and adaptive feedback control. With the designed controllers and update laws for the <b>system</b> <b>parameter</b> in the node dynamics, we obtain two theorems on the lag synchronization based on the LaSalle invariance principle. When the lag synchronization is achieved, we identify the unknown <b>system</b> <b>parameter.</b> Finally, we provide two numerical examples to verify {{the efficiency of the}} proposed control schemes.|$|R

Zhang and Heidel showed that, at least for dissipative and conservative quadratic systems, three-dimensional quadratic systems with {{only three or four}} terms on the right-hand side cannot exhibit chaotic behavior. [...] The reason is, simply put, that solutions to such systems are asymptotic to a two-dimensional surface and therefore solutions are well behaved.|$|E
