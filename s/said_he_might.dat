5|$|Albert {{seems to}} have {{received}} Luther's letter with the Theses {{around the end of}} November. He requested the opinion of theologians at the University of Mainz and conferred with his advisers. His advisers recommended he have Luther prohibited from preaching against indulgences in accordance with the indulgence bull. Albert requested such action from the Roman Curia. In Rome, Luther was immediately perceived as a threat. In February 1518, Pope Leo asked the head of the Augustinian Hermits, Luther's religious order, to convince him to stop spreading his ideas about indulgences. Sylvester Mazzolini was also appointed to write an opinion which would be used in the trial against him. Mazzolini wrote A Dialogue against Martin Luther's Presumptuous Theses concerning the Power of the Pope, which focused on Luther's questioning of the pope's authority rather than his complaints about indulgence preaching. Luther received a summons to Rome in August 1518. He responded with Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences, in which he attempted to clear himself of the charge that he was attacking the pope. As he set down his views more extensively, Luther {{seems to have}} recognized that the implications of his beliefs set him further from official teaching than he initially knew. He later <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not have begun the controversy had he known where it would lead. The Explanations have been called Luther's first Reformation work.|$|E
25|$|In December 1995, Eastwood {{sought to}} {{exercise}} {{his right to}} appropriate the water rights linked to the Odello property from the State Water Resources Control Board. Eastwood and his representatives said during a public hearing on his request that the appropriation was needed to establish the fair {{market value of the}} Odello Ranch for tax purposes. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> donate the land along with the water rights to the Big Sur Land Trust.|$|E
25|$|This {{accident}} left Hogan, age 36, with a double-fracture of the pelvis, {{a fractured}} collar bone, a left ankle fracture, a chipped rib, and near-fatal blood clots: he would suffer lifelong circulation problems and other physical limitations. His doctors <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> never walk again, let alone play golf competitively. While in hospital, Hogan's life was endangered by {{a blood clot}} problem, leading doctors to tie off the vena cava. Hogan left the hospital on April 1, 59 days after the accident.|$|E

25|$|The {{film was}} met with a {{generally}} negative reception from professional critics, getting an 11% (rotten) rating on movie review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, and had less than $5 million in total box office receipts. The film earned an additional $5M in DVD and Blu-ray sales, {{for a total of}} about half of its $20M budget. The producer and screenwriter John Aglialoro blamed critics for the film's paltry box office take and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> go on strike, but ultimately went on to make the next two installments.|$|E
25|$|In December 1982, the Federal Highway Administration {{approved}} a $6 million interchange at Cloverdale Road. Price {{offered to pay}} for the interchange, which would've advanced the 1990 completion date to 1985 or 1986. Meanwhile, Boise developer Larry Leasure proposed a shopping mall, named Westpark, at the intersection of Cole and Franklin Roads, but the mall was on hold due to zoning and access problems. Price <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> consider dropping the Cloverdale project if Leasure would agree to sell the Westpark site to him when the issues were resolved.|$|E
25|$|With Lord Fitzwilliam, in Grosvenor Square, for {{the purpose}} of {{discussing}} the subject of a coalition with him, and of endeavouring to prevail on him to speak to Fox—Lord Fitzwilliam's sentiments perfectly right—he said his opposition never had been to the constitution of the country, but to the Government when it acted in a way he thought contrary to the constitution; that, therefore, when that was in danger he ceased to be in opposition. On going over the matter it became evident that the great obstacle would arise from Fox's being too much entangled with Grey, Lambton, and that set of men who had lately separated themselves from the party, in order to form a party of their own, and who publicly professed doctrines and opinions in direct opposition to what he and I considered to be for the good and welfare of the public. That this would indeed be very hard and unreasonable, that for the sake of these very men, who both in their public and private capacity had been as inimical as possible, an arrangement should be broken off so salutary and so advisable. Lord Fitzwilliani and myself agreed on every point; he, however, went beyond me in insisting on the indispensable necessity of Pitt resigning the Treasury for another Cabinet office. He acquiesced in the wisdom of trying to bring Fox to be less attached to these false friends, and said Tom Grenville was the best man to speak to him. Lord Fitzwilliam expressed his dislike to Sheridan, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have a lucrative place, but never could be admitted to one of trust and confidence. On my wishing him not to leave town, he said he could safely trust his conscience with the Duke of Portland, and was at the same time ready to return at the shortest notice.|$|E

5000|$|By April 1980, however, Freeman <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{serve as}} {{governor}} whenever Treen {{was out of}} the state. Depending on the urgency of the situation, Freeman <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> veto legislation if Treen were, for instance, in Detroit attending the Republican National Convention during the week of July 13, 1980. His estrangement with Treen was compared at the time to that of the California Lieutenant Governor, Republican Mike Curb, who had quarreled with Democratic Governor Jerry Brown. Freeman took over as [...] "acting governor" [...] under the Louisiana Constitution whenever Treen left the state.|$|R
25|$|A {{second major}} {{educational}} issue which arose during Chavous' third term was {{another round of}} reform aimed at the D.C. Board of Education. On September 24, 2003, Mayor Williams announced that the city's public school system was so dysfunctional and provided such low-quality education that he was introducing legislation to strip the Board of nearly all its power. Control over the school system would {{be given to the}} mayor, who would have the right to hire and fire the superintendent, principals, teachers, and other workers and who would gain significant new powers to reconstitute programs, operations, curriculum, and schools. Although Chavous was working on his own bill to give the Council and mayor more power over the school system, he immediately threw his support behind Williams' plan. But little action on the mayor's plan had been taken by January 2004. Chavous argued that Williams had not been forceful enough in making the case for his proposal, and journalist Craig Timberg linked Chavous' lack of activity on the measure to a reluctance to take on a controversial issue in an election year. (Chavous' own bill was also delayed, and he said it would not be ready until at least March 2004.) Williams <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> seek a third term as mayor merely to fight for his school reform bill, if the council did not act more expeditiously. In February 2004, Chavous announced he no longer supported the mayor's bill. The school district was without a superintendent, and Chavous argued that no individual would want the job if the council was considering such a significant change to the position. He also said that giving the mayor hiring and firing authority over the superintendent would require congressional approval or a voter referendum, and both processes would take too long. Chavous then introduced a bill which largely undid the 2000 reforms. The new bill provided for a nine-member board, with eight elected members (one from each ward) and a president elected citywide. Chavous' committee approved the bill in April 2004 without a hearing. Although Mayor Williams submitted an altered form of his original proposal two weeks after the defeat, it was rejected in mid-May and the Chavous bill approved by the council in July on a close 7-to-6 vote.|$|E
500|$|After {{the bowl}} game, in February 2009, the {{athletic}} department named offensive coordinator James Franklin the [...] "head coach-in-waiting", meaning {{that he would be}} the eventual successor to Ralph Friedgen. Upon the expiration of Friedgen's contract in January 2012, Franklin will be offered the position or paid a US$1million contractual buyout. In June 2009, Friedgen <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> like to stay an additional two years past his current contract, but athletic director Deborah Yow responded that the school could not afford the buyout. She said that any extension would have to be worked out between Friedgen and Franklin.|$|E
500|$|The twelfth {{and final}} {{song of the}} album, {{selected}} as a single, is Mac Davis' [...] "In The Ghetto". The song was chosen by Billy Strange, who had previously picked material for other Presley sessions. The protest song denounces the consequences of poverty, with compassion for inner-city youth. Because of [...] "In the Ghetto"'s lyrics, controversial for its time, Presley originally did not plan to record the song {{because he thought it}} might alienate fans. After Moman <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> give the song to Rosey Grier, Presley's friends Joe Esposito and George Klein (initially opposed to [...] "In the Ghetto"), convinced the singer to record it.|$|E
50|$|There {{were wide}} {{sweeping}} rumours about which artists {{were going to}} try for Eurovision, one in particular was Bill Bailey however his tour in Australia kept him out, however <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> try out for next year.|$|R
6000|$|... "May I {{walk back}} with you?" [...] he asked. And {{when she had}} <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> if <b>he</b> wanted, he {{observed}} {{that he had seen}} her and recognized her half a mile away.|$|R
60|$|I {{knew what}} that meant, and a cold shiver {{went up and down}} my backbone. But I looked down at him--spick-and-span and glossy--his neckties are never crooked--and <b>said,</b> yes, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> come at three o'clock.|$|R
500|$|During {{a seventh}} {{interview}} the next day, Raghip described noises he said Blakelock had {{made during the}} attack. During the eighth interview, {{he said he had}} armed himself that night with a broom handle, and had tried to get close to what was happening to Blakelock, but there were too many people around him: [...] "I had a weapon when I was running toward the policeman, a broom handle." [...] He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have kicked or hit him had he been able to get close enough. Rose writes that Raghip also offered the order in which Blakelock's attackers had launched the assault. He was held for another two days, released on bail, then charged with murder six weeks later, in December 1985, under the doctrine of common purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Chief Executive, Donald Tsang, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{not vote}} {{and called the}} by-elections a [...] "drama" [...] during an {{interview}} with South China Morning Post.|$|E
2500|$|As of August 2016, the Moroun {{family has}} spent 10 years and $12 million on electricity, {{windows and the}} {{elevator}} shaft, to revitalize the building. Matthew Moroun <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> put part of his family's operations in the 18-story Corktown building. [...] In September 2017 the [...] "Detroit Homecoming" [...] event {{was held in the}} station, the first legal event to occur there since the building's closure in 1988.|$|E
50|$|On {{the first}} anniversary of his {{dismissal}} (24 February 2005) Kasyanov gave a press conference at which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> run for president in the 2008 elections. His bid was supported by Leonid Nevzlin and Boris Berezovsky and Garry Kasparov.|$|R
60|$|That same evening, {{the gentleman}} {{in the white}} {{waistcoat}} most positively and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but {{that he would be}} drawn and quartered into the bargain. Mr. Bumble shook his head with gloomy mystery, and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> wished <b>he</b> <b>might</b> come to good; whereunto Mr. Gamfield replied, that <b>he</b> wished <b>he</b> <b>might</b> come to him; which, although he agreed with the beadle in most matters, {{would seem to be a}} wish of a totally opposite description.|$|R

2500|$|On 8 May, three {{party leaders}} {{announced}} their resignations {{within an hour}} of each other: Ed Miliband (Labour) and Nick Clegg (Liberal Democrat) resigned due to their parties' worse-than-expected results in the election, although both had been re-elected to their seats in Parliament. Nigel Farage (UKIP) offered his resignation because he had failed to be elected as MP for Thanet South, but <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> re-stand in the resulting leadership election. However, on 11 May, the UKIP executive rejected his resignation {{on the grounds that the}} election campaign had been [...] "a great success", and Farage agreed to continue as party leader.|$|E
2500|$|February 1825 saw Fitzwilliam {{attending}} a Lords' debate on Catholic Emancipation and {{later that year}} {{he was at a}} meeting of Protestant peers who had land in Ireland to address the king on Catholic Emancipation. In the summer of 1826 whilst staying in Ireland a deputation of local Catholics honoured him, saying [...] "they hailed my short administration as the forerunner of a new system". Fitzwilliam wrote to Lord Grey on 28 January 1827 that [...] "If this lack of emancipation is to go on till you have war with a foreign power, from that instant you lose Ireland". A hostile Ireland would cut British communications with her South American allies and he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> request an audience with the king to tell him that his anti-Catholic policy would lead to an explosion.|$|E
2500|$|While on the Never Say Never tour, fellow {{group members}} Swifty and Kuniva (D12) along with Royce Da 5'9" [...] stopped by KISS 100FM for a live {{interview}} and spoke on Relapse. Royce {{stated that the}} album will be a game changer and jokingly <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have to push his own album back three years after Eminem drops his. Kuniva added that D12 recorded many tracks for Relapse but wasn't sure if they would make the album or not. Swifty then confirmed that Eminem would be dropping two albums in 2009, with Relapse 2 following Relapse. Relapse was re-released on December 21, 2009, as Relapse: Refill, with seven bonus tracks and including the single [...] "Forever" [...] (originally on More Than a Game soundtrack), [...] "Taking My Ball" [...] (released with DJ Hero), and five previously unreleased tracks. On its re-release, Eminem stated: [...] "I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned. Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year".|$|E
6000|$|... "Who could foresee such a thing?" [...] {{the old man}} <b>said</b> plaintively. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> {{have added}} Major Clutterbuck's {{thousand}} pounds as another item to be cleared, but he thought it as well to keep silent upon the point.|$|R
50|$|In January 2015, Robertson <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{run against}} Representative Neugebauerin the 2016 election. Robertson cited his {{unhappiness}} {{with what he}} called Neugebauer's failure to bolster the cotton industry. In March, Robertson <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> would not run for Congress but would instead seek re-election as mayor.|$|R
50|$|On January 5, 2015, Gibson {{announced}} that he would not run for re-election in 2016. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> run for statewide office in 2018, when the offices of Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Comptroller and Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand's Senate seat will be up for election.|$|R
6000|$|... "We do not {{generally}} accommodate," [...] "I <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> stay"--these were phrases which I turned {{over in my}} mind. If she were the lady clerk she might say [...] "we"--even the boy said [...] "we"--but [...] "I <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> stay" [...] was different. A daughter of a landlord or a landlady might say that.|$|E
