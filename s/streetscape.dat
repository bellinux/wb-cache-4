Cedar Lane underwent a $3.9 million <b>Streetscape</b> project, completed in 2006, designed to attract additional business to the area through new sidewalk paving with brick edging, bump-outs to allow easier pedestrian crossing, old-fashioned lamp posts and street plantings.|$|E
40|$|The urban {{landscape}} encompasses {{a broad spectrum}} of variable environments ranging from remnant patches to highly modified <b>streetscapes.</b> Despite the expansion of urban environments, few studies have examined the influence of urbanization on faunal diversity, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. In this study, four broad habitat types were recognized in the urban environment, representing a continuum of modification ranging from parks with remnant vegetation to <b>streetscapes</b> dominated by native vegetation and those dominated by exotic vegetation to recently developed <b>streetscapes.</b> Bird censuses were conducted at 36 sites throughout urban Melbourne, with nine sites surveyed in each habitat type. The four habitat types supported significantly different bird communities based on species richness, abundance and composition suggesting that bird assemblages of urban environments are non-uniform. Parks and native <b>streetscapes</b> generally supported fewer introduced species than exotic and recently developed <b>streetscapes.</b> Overall abundance and richness of species were lower in the exotic and recently developed <b>streetscapes</b> than in parks and native <b>streetscapes.</b> Significant differences were also observed in foraging guilds within the four habitat types, with parks having the most foraging guilds and recently developed <b>streetscapes</b> having the fewest. The transition from native to exotic <b>streetscapes</b> saw the progressive loss of insectivorous and nectarivorous species reflecting a reliance by these species on structurally diverse and/or native vegetation for both shelter and food resources. The implementation of effective strategies and incentives which encourage the planting of structurally diverse native vegetation in <b>streetscapes</b> and gardens should be paramount if avian biodiversity is to be retained and enhanced in urban environments. It is also critical to encourage the maintenance of the existing remnant vegetation in the urban environment. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Urban <b>streetscapes</b> are outdoor {{areas in}} which the general public can {{appreciate}} green landscapes and engage in outdoor activities along the street. This study tested {{the extent to which}} the degree of awareness of urban street trees impacts attention restoration and perceived restorativeness. We manipulated the degree of awareness of street trees. Participants were placed into four groups and shown different images: (a) <b>streetscapes</b> with absolutely no trees; (b) <b>streetscapes</b> with flashes of trees in which participants had minimal awareness of the content; (c) <b>streetscapes</b> with trees; and (d) <b>streetscapes</b> with trees to which participants were told to pay attention. We compared the performance of 138 individuals on measures of attention and their evaluations of perceived restorativeness. Two main findings emerged. First, <b>streetscapes</b> with trees improved the performance of participants on attentional tests even without their awareness of the trees. Second, participants who had raised awareness of street trees performed best on the attentional test and rated the <b>streetscapes</b> as being more restorative. These findings enhance our knowledge about the role of an individual’s awareness of restorative elements and have implications for designers and individuals who are at risk of attentional fatigue...|$|R

5|$|The {{trunkline}} {{was originally}} {{a section of}} US41/M-28 and M-35. Before the 1930s, the main highways ran through the two downtown areas when US41/M-28 was relocated to run near Teal Lake. The former routing had various names over the years. It was designated as an alternate route of the main highways, using both the US41A/M-28A and Alt. US41/ALT M-28 designations before it was designated as Bus. M-28 in 1958. M-35 continued to run through downtown Negaunee along {{a section of the}} highway until the 1960s. A rerouting in 1999 moved the trunkline designation along Lakeshore Drive in Ishpeming, and a <b>streetscape</b> project rebuilt the road in Negaunee in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Ann Arbor's {{residential}} neighborhoods contain architectural styles {{ranging from}} classic 19th-century and early-20th-century designs to ranch-style houses. Among these homes {{are a number}} of kit houses built in the early 20th century. Contemporary-style houses are farther from the downtown district. Surrounding the University of Michigan campus are houses and apartment complexes occupied primarily by student renters. Tower Plaza, a 26-story condominium building located between the University of Michigan campus and downtown, is the tallest building in Ann Arbor. The 19th-century buildings and <b>streetscape</b> of the Old West Side neighborhood have been preserved virtually intact; in 1972, the district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and it is further protected by city ordinances and a nonprofit preservation group.|$|E
5|$|Libraries in Denmark {{are also}} {{cultural}} and community centres. They {{play an active}} role in the cultural life and host many events, exhibitions, discussion groups, workshops, educational courses and facilitate everyday cultural activities for and by the citizens. In June 2015, the large central library and cultural centre of Dokk1 opened at the harbour front. Dokk1 also includes civil administrations and services, commercial office rentals and a large underground robotic car park and aims to be a landmark for the city and a public meeting place. The building of Dokk1 and the associated squares and <b>streetscape</b> is also collectively known as Urban Mediaspace Aarhus and it is the largest construction project Aarhus municipality has ever undertaken. Apart from this large main library, some neighbourhoods in Aarhus have a local library engaged in similar cultural and educational activities, but on a more local scale.|$|E
40|$|Historical <b>streetscapes</b> are {{considered}} to be important in terms of their ability to contribute to an area's historical and cultural heritage and identity as well as for their landscape value. In this study, through a comparison of historical <b>streetscapes</b> in Japan and Australia with differing historical and cultural backgrounds and different architectural styles, it was sought to discover appropriate conservation methods for individual areas. It was found that, with regard to the conservation of historical <b>streetscapes,</b> as well as considering the careful conservation of single traditional structures, it is important to focus on the conservation of rows of historical structures, and that not only the architectural style of traditional structures but also landscape elements such as street furniture and street signs were important in creating the atmosphere of historical <b>streetscapes...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the objective of finding the perceivable effect of figures and backgrounds on residential <b>streetscapes</b> and their connections in visual complexity. The visual complexity depends on the extent of information a viewer can observe from a visible area. The information includes a number of visual elements along the <b>streetscapes</b> and their diversity and interconnections. The aim of this research was to analyze the structural hierarchical visual complexity of the <b>streetscapes,</b> caused by varied spatial arrangement and numerous spatial connections of the perceivable visual elements. The visual elements of 60 residential <b>streetscapes</b> were classified into figures and backgrounds using human perception of 20 subjects. The identified figures and backgrounds were arranged in a taxonomic diagram representing their connections. These taxonomic diagrams reflect the structural hierarchical visual complexity. Finally, taxonomic entropy was applied to statistically analyze the structural hierarchical visual complexity. When the taxonomic diagram is vertically and horizontally lengthy and the arrangement of the elements of taxonomic diagram is irregular, the complexity increases depicting a large number of figures whose spatial connections impart a high visual complexity to the <b>streetscapes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{bryophyte}} floristics of industrial/commercial <b>streetscapes</b> {{of urban}} Victoria {{and the importance}} of various substrata to species richness were explored. Species richness was low compared to healthy natural environments. Thirty mosses from 14 families, and six liverworts, each from different families, were identified. Most species occurred at fewer than 30 % of sites, showing the patchy nature of their distribution. Only three species occurred at more than half the sites. Markedly higher species richness occurred on soil than on any other substratum. Epiphytes were extremely few. The low bryodiversity of <b>streetscapes,</b> the patchy nature of the bryophytes and the high number of colonists suggest that the <b>streetscapes</b> have not fulfilled their potential in providing connectivity between urban and non-urban areas. Colonists characteristically occur early in the successional sequence of disturbed areas but, as <b>streetscapes</b> are continually disturbed, colonists effectively are climax species for this habitat. Better management of <b>streetscapes</b> to provide more complex habitat is needed to enable colonisation of these areas by bryophyte species that are more representative of our ever-shrinking natural habitats...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{all other}} {{stations}} {{on the line}} from Lincoln west, Ayer has no dedicated station parking, despite serving over 400 passengers per day. The lots adjacent to the station are privately owned and serve local businesses, but are often illegally used by commuters using the station. The 30-space Nashua River Rail Trail parking lot is available for commuters on weekdays; some commuters also use street parking and other business lots. In 2003, the town and the Montachusett Regional Transit Authority (MART) began planning how to increase parking capacity. Five studies in six years concluded with plans for an $11 million, 400-space garage off Park Street, accessibility improvements to the station, and <b>streetscape</b> improvements for pedestrian access. The plans were reduced in scale due to traffic concerns and other issues. $3.2 million in FTA funds (originally intended for expanded parking at Littleton/Route 495 but later rejected) was committed to build a $4 million surface lot. However, the lot was delayed due to conflicts with businesses that would be displaced and the lack of a publicly owned pedestrian entrance (a requirement to use the federal funds).|$|E
