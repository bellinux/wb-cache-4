5000|$|In his three-year-old debut, Union Rags won the Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream Park [...] "comfortably" [...] by four lengths from News Pending, {{with the}} favored Discreet Dancer {{two and a}} quarter lengths further back in third. At the same course five weeks later, Union Rags started the odds-on {{favorite}} for the Florida Derby but finished third behind Take Charge Indy. In the Kentucky Derby, he started second favorite at odds of 5.1/1. Following a poor start, {{and at one point}} last in the field, he finished seventh of the twenty runners, seven and a half lengths behind I'll Have Another. Union Rags did not run in the 2012 Preakness Stakes but was entered in the Belmont Stakes on June 9. Following the withdrawal of I'll Have Another, Union Rags started second favorite for the race behind Dullahan. John Velasquez settled the colt in fourth place on the rail as Paynter set the pace. In the <b>straight,</b> <b>Union</b> Rags made steady progress on the inside to overtake Paynter in the final strides and won by a neck. After the race, Matz said, [...] "We always thought this horse had Triple Crown potential." ...|$|E
50|$|The 2011 {{campaign}} {{started off}} with a 20-0 shutout of Towns County before <b>Union</b> lost six <b>straight</b> games. <b>Union</b> rebounded with a 10-7 win at Rabun County and a 30-15 dusting of Fannin County. The Panthers lost {{the final game of}} the year to Hart County, 28-14, to finish with a 3-7 record.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{limit of}} {{energies}} of {{a sequence of}} harmonic maps as their annular domains approach the boundary of moduli space depends upon the boundary point approached. The infinite energy case is associated with limits of images containing ruled surfaces. The finite energy case yields a limit of images, under a suitable topology, with a union of discs and straight line segments. Generalization to higher numbers of boundary components shows that minimal surfaces <b>union</b> <b>straight</b> line segments can still be achieved, and that the configuration of straight line segments depends on the direction of approach of domain conformal classes to the boundary point of domain moduli space. Bubbling can occur in variable ways according to the metric representatives of the conformal classes of domains. A method is given whereby bubbling can be eliminated yielding a point-wise limit of maps with image limit containing a surface <b>union</b> <b>straight</b> line segments. Content...|$|R
50|$|The {{economy was}} one of the main issues used by both sides in the {{referendum}} campaign. Supporters of joining the EU said that it would fuel growth and create more jobs, while opponents said that EU entry would slow the growth of the Estonian economy. Opponents also argued that Estonia should not go <b>straight</b> from one <b>union,</b> the Soviet Union, into the EU.|$|R

50|$|From Willard Straight Hall's opening, {{the main}} desk was staffed by {{undergraduate}} students. In addition, the building's policies are set, updated, and {{enforced by the}} student-led Willard Straight Hall Board of Governors, more commonly known on campus as the Willard <b>Straight</b> Hall Student <b>Union</b> Board (SUB). However, the North Entrance was at first reserved for men, women being relegated to a second entrance {{at the south end}} of the building.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the summer}} of 1933, Edwards' Collegians, a touring band, {{migrated}} to Pennsylvania for a dance tour. Upon arriving in Philadelphia {{in the fall of}} 1933, the band signed for a steady gig at The Rafters in West Philadelphia and [...] "ran <b>straight</b> into <b>union</b> trouble." [...] This was a Union band, carrying [...] "Conditional Membership" [...] cards from the American Federation of Musicians. [...] Fairfax, the band's manager, found union recognition in this area unfavorable to black musicians. [...] He wrote, [...] "The musicians needed new union cards. The dues of (white) Local 77, AFM were then $15 a year, over and above a stiff initiation fee that the members of Edward’s Collegians simply could not afford. Each musician received only $3 for a night’s work." ...|$|R

Both schools offered elementary level education, but quickly enlarged curriculum to include secondary, collegiate, and professional level instruction.|$|R

But, say, there's one bit of advice I'll give you before we part: If you're in trouble in Vermissa, go <b>straight</b> to the <b>Union</b> House and see Boss McGinty. He is the Bodymaster of Vermissa Lodge, and nothing can happen in these parts unless Black Jack McGinty wants it. So long, mate! Maybe we'll meet in lodge one of these evenings.

Of course--if--if you think the speculation too risky, I'll put up the dust for the corner." ...|$|R
50|$|Smalls {{guided the}} ship past the five Confederate harbor forts without incident, as {{he gave the}} correct signals at checkpoints. The Planter had been {{commanded}} by a Captain Relay, and Smalls copied Relay's manners and straw hat on deck to fool Confederate onlookers from shore and the forts. The Planter sailed past Fort Sumter at about 4:30 a.m. He headed <b>straight</b> for the <b>Union</b> Navy fleet, flying a white bed sheet as a surrender flag. The Planter had been seen by the USS Onward, which was about to fire until a crewman spotted the white flag. The Onward′s captain, John Frederick Nickels, boarded the Planter, and Smalls asked for a United States flag to display. He surrendered the Planter and her cargo to the United States Navy. Smalls' escape plan had succeeded.|$|R
500|$|On April 19, 1969, Cornell's Afro-American Society {{occupied}} the Willard <b>Straight</b> Hall student <b>union</b> in protest against [...] "the university's racist attitudes and irrelevant curriculum" [...] regarding racial issues. The university was divided between {{proponents of the}} inclusion of the principles of social justice in course instruction and advocates of academic freedom for the faculty. This clash affected the Department of Government, where Kahin and a number of professors defending academic freedom resided. Many of these professors had considered leaving the university due to the administration's policies promoting racial justice, and many did following the end of the occupation. The following week, the Department of Government organized a teach-in on academic freedom, and Kahin was invited to speak at the event by department chair Peter Sharfman. Historian Walter LaFeber would later remember his remarks as [...] "the most eloquent speech about academic freedom I have ever encountered anywhere up to that time or since that time".|$|R
