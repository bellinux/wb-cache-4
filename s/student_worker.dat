40|$|<b>Student</b> <b>workers</b> are an {{indispensable}} component of library operations. They {{play an important}} role in delivering good library services to the patrons. Without <b>student</b> <b>workers,</b> the library would not function as effectively as it does. Literature search yields few papers addressing the topic of how <b>student</b> <b>workers</b> perceived their employment in the library. The author of this paper intends to fill the void in the literature by asking <b>student</b> <b>workers</b> in her interlibrary loan and document delivery department how they perceive their library jobs, the working environment, and the work ethic of staff and fellow students. The author would also like to find out how well students communicate with their supervisors, what training method is most preferred by <b>student</b> <b>workers,</b> what motivates <b>students</b> to do a good job, and what most often triggers their resignation from the library. Giving <b>student</b> <b>workers</b> an opportunity to voice their concerns/suggestions is a proactive way to lead the department to continue to serve successfully.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the {{problems related to}} the management of <b>student</b> <b>workers</b> in academic libraries. It reviews relevant literature in library sci-ence and in management theory, with special emphasis placed on an under-standing of what motivates <b>student</b> <b>workers</b> and on the valuable contribu-tion they may make in the academic library. Finally, suggestions are offered relative to the hiring, training, and supervision of <b>student</b> <b>workers.</b> MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN both pro and con {{on the use of}} <b>student</b> <b>workers</b> in li-braries. 1 A review of this literature reveals a lack of application of management theory, especially that of organizational behavior, in handling student personnel problems. The literature does show, however, that librar-ians are concerned with increasing the effec-tiveness of <b>student</b> <b>workers</b> in their organi-zations. In order to encourage better per-formance from <b>student</b> <b>workers,</b> 'there is a definite need to understand and deal with motivational processes and styles of supervi-sion as they relate to the student. As a result of cultural conditioning, people today, including ~tudents, expect more satisfaction from their jobs, increasing responsibility and autonomy, and participa-tion in decision making. 2 Thus the problems associated with <b>student</b> <b>workers</b> are not unique to libraries but potentially exist in any organization. It is important that these problems are not perceived as unique and that one makes use of the body of informa-tion available in organizational behavior to propose solutions...|$|R
