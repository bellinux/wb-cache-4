25|$|True {{littoral}} caves {{should not}} be confused with inland caves that have been intersected and revealed when a <b>sea</b> <b>cliff</b> line is eroded back, or with dissolutional voids formed in the littoral zone on tropical islands. In some regions, such as Halong Bay, Vietnam, caves in carbonate rocks are found in littoral zones, and being enlarged by littoral processes but were originally formed by dissolution. Such caves have been termed as hybrid caves.|$|E

25|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>cliff</b> erosion {{is a large}} {{source of}} {{sediment}} to many coastal sedimentary budgets, initiated by many different processes including wave attack, rainfall and groundwater seepage. Cliff erosion can be influenced by rising sea levels and is magnified with storm surge events. An example of cliff erosion is the erosion of large Pleistocene alluvial fans that span {{the length of the}} Canterbury Bight, situated north of the Waitaki River in New Zealand. The erosion of these cliffs, due to high energy wave environments contributes 70% of the overall material supplied to these beaches.|$|E
25|$|In {{the north}} the {{escarpment}} meets the coastline, {{and north of}} this the coastal road Lawrence Hargrave Drive hugs the cliffline. The unstable geology of the escarpment resulted in rockfalls, forcing {{the closure of the}} road. Subsequently, part of Lawrence Hargrave Drive was replaced in 2005 by the <b>Sea</b> <b>Cliff</b> Bridge just off the coast, crossing the submerged rock shelf. The bridge carries both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The Illawarra railway line must go through several tunnels to reach the Sydney metropolitan area. The Southern Freeway and Princes Highway provide alternative inland routes, descending the escarpment further south at Bulli Pass or at Mount Ousley, entering just north of Wollongong's city centre.|$|E
25|$|Radio {{interferometry}} was pioneered in 1946, when Joseph Lade Pawsey, Ruby Payne-Scott and Lindsay McCready used {{a single}} antenna atop a <b>sea</b> <b>cliff</b> to observe 200MHz solar radiation. Two incident beams, one {{directly from the}} sun and the other reflected from the sea surface, generated the necessary interference. The first multi-receiver interferometer was built in the same year by Martin Ryle and Vonberg. In 1960, Ryle and Antony Hewish published the technique of aperture synthesis to analyze interferometer data. The aperture synthesis process, which involves autocorrelating and discrete Fourier transforming the incoming signal, recovers both the spatial and frequency variation in flux. The result is a 3D image whose third axis is frequency. For this work, Ryle and Hewish were jointly awarded the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
