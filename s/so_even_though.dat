25|$|The {{exponential}} processor transistor growth {{predicted by}} Moore {{does not always}} translate into exponentially greater practical CPU performance. Since around 2005–2007, Dennard scaling appears to have broken down, <b>so</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> Moore's law continued for several years after that, it has not yielded dividends in improved performance. The primary reason cited for the breakdown is that at small sizes, current leakage poses greater challenges, and also causes the chip to heat up, which creates a threat of thermal runaway and therefore, further increases energy costs.|$|E

25|$|Though the law {{was highly}} {{offensive}} to many Northerners, Southerners complained bitterly about perceived slackness in enforcement.

25|$|A failed two-year {{relationship}} with Australian model Helena Vestergaard, {{who was only}} 19 when they began dating in 2012 (he was 50), served as {{a major influence on}} his songwriting for the band's 2016 album, The Getaway which often has Kiedis questioning their relationship and the age difference between the two. “Lyrically, I’m embarrassed to say, but a two-year relationship that completely fell apart like a nuclear bomb just left me feeling pretty raw and available to the emotional universe for writing. <b>So</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the relationship {{was a bit of a}} disaster, I feel that in some way I did get something out of it, which was about half the songs on this record,” Kiedis said.|$|E
25|$|In this case, the claimants let a {{block of}} flats to the {{defendants}} at an annual rent of £2500. However, they agreed to accept a reduction in rent to £1250, because the defendants were unable to find enough tenants due to the evacuation of London during World War II. This promise to accept a lesser rent was unsupported by consideration. At {{the end of the}} war the flats became fully let, and the claimants demanded the return to payment of full rent. Denning J held that they were entitled to this from the last two quarters of 1945. Denning mentioned in an obiter dictum that had the plaintiffs tried to be reimbursed for the full amount they would have been estopped from doing <b>so</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> no consideration was present. This is because the plaintiff represented that he would accept half the rent and the defendant acted upon this.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{exceptions}} in both directions.

25|$|A {{transmission}} {{consists of}} horizontal lines, scanned {{from left to}} right. The color components are sent separately one line after another. The color encoding and order of transmission can vary between modes. Most modes use an RGB color model; some modes are black-and-white, with only one channel being sent; other modes use a YC color model, which consists of luminance (Y) and chrominance (R–Y and B–Y). The modulating frequency changes between 1500 and 2300Hz, corresponding to the intensity (brightness) of the color component. The modulation is analog, <b>so</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the horizontal resolution is often defined as 256 or 320 pixels, they can be sampled using any rate. The image aspect ratio is conventionally 4:3. Lines usually end in a 1200Hz horizontal synchronization pulse of 5 milliseconds (after all color components of the line have been sent); in some modes, the synchronization pulse lies {{in the middle of}} the line.|$|E

He said “the customer’s psychology always favors a busy place,” because the sight of a busy firm will make people trust it and claimed that the aim of The Shanghai Bank was to serve society and not just make a profit. <b>So,</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> some services would not be profitable, they still had to be offered.

25|$|As for the Chargers, the {{implications}} of their defeat were worse in hindsight as this remains as the only Super Bowl the Chargers had ever played in and including the pre AFL-NFL merger, the 3rd championship game the Chargers lost, since they previously won the AFL Championship in 1963. That championship remains to this day as the only major sports championship the city of San Diego has won (and also the longest championship drought for any city that has at least two major sports franchises), <b>so</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> they were heavy underdogs, the loss still had a great significance. The Chargers would also not win another playoff game since then until the 2007 season, {{when they reached the}} AFC Championship, but lost to the then 18-0 New England Patriots, 21–12. This remains the closest the Chargers have gotten to returning to the Super Bowl as of the 2016 season. Super Bowl XXIX would be their only appearance while playing in San Diego, before they moved to Los Angeles following the 2016 season.|$|E

25|$|One {{theory is}} that these {{problems}} are caused by a structural contradiction within the euro system, the {{theory is that}} there is a monetary union (common currency) without a fiscal union (e.g., common taxation, pension, and treasury functions). In the Eurozone system, the countries are required to follow a similar fiscal path, but they do not have common treasury to enforce it. That is, countries with the same monetary system have freedom in fiscal policies in taxation and expenditure. <b>So,</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> there are some agreements on monetary policy and through the European Central Bank, countries may not be able to or would simply choose not to follow it. This feature brought fiscal free riding of peripheral economies, especially represented by Greece, as it is hard to control and regulate national financial institutions. Furthermore, there is also a problem that the Eurozone system has a difficult structure for quick response. Eurozone, having 18 nations as its members, require unanimous agreement for a decision making process. This would lead to failure in complete prevention of contagion of other areas, as it would be hard for the Eurozone to respond quickly to the problem.|$|E
25|$|Once bonded, a {{male and}} female kiwi tend to live their entire lives as a monogamous couple. During the mating season, June to March, the pair call to each other at night, and meet in the nesting burrow every three days. These {{relationships}} may last for up to 20years. They are unusual among other birds in that, along with some raptors, they have a functioning pair of ovaries. (In most birds and in platypuses, the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional.) Kiwi eggs can weigh up to one-quarter {{the weight of the}} female. Usually, only one egg is laid per season. The kiwi lays the biggest egg in proportion to its size of any bird in the world, <b>so</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> the kiwi {{is about the size of}} a domestic chicken, it is able to lay eggs that are about six times the size of a chicken's egg. The eggs are smooth in texture, and are ivory or greenish white. The male incubates the egg, except for the great spotted kiwi, A. haastii, in which both parents are involved. The incubation period is 63–92days. Producing the huge egg places significant physiological stress on the female; for the thirty days it takes to grow the fully developed egg, the female must eat three times her normal amount of food. Two to three days before the egg is laid there is little space left inside the female for her stomach and she is forced to fast.|$|E

500|$|Roosevelt {{had been}} {{an outspoken critic of}} Wilson's {{neutrality}} policies, <b>so</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> Roosevelt had made several attempts to come to an agreement with Wilson, the President was unwilling to accept any compromise. In an astute political maneuver, Wilson announced to the press that he would not send Roosevelt and his volunteers to France, but instead would send an American Expeditionary Force under the command of General John Pershing. Roosevelt was left with no option except to disband the volunteers. [...] He never forgave Wilson, and quickly published The Foes Of Our Own Household, a harsh indictment of the sitting president. These relentless attacks helped the Republicans win control of Congress in 1918. Roosevelt might have been a serious candidate for president in 1920 had he not died in 1919.|$|E

500|$|The Fugitive Slave Act {{continued}} to be contentious after its enactment: Southerners complained bitterly about any slackness, but enforcement was highly offensive to many Northerners. Abolitionists recited the inequities of the law: it punished severely any aid to an escaped slave, and if captured, he had no due process and could not testify before a magistrate who would be paid more for deciding he was a slave than for deciding he was not. Nevertheless, Fillmore believed himself bound by his oath as president and by the bargain made in the Compromise to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act.
