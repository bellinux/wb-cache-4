5|$|Each of {{the three}} {{scenarios}} follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and the story's divergence mainly depends on whether an idol passes or fails an audition, though {{this is not always}} the case. Some outcomes, such as failing to pass the first audition, can lead the game to end prematurely and offer an alternate ending to the plot. An audition marks the end of a chapter, after which the story will progress onto the next stage. In the game's <b>stage</b> <b>mode,</b> the player is able to freely customize a stand-alone performance, including options for the song, costume, accessories, choreography and camera positioning. Up to 16 players can participate via Wi-Fi in the <b>stage</b> <b>mode</b> by offering three types of cheers during one player's performance. If the game is played on a Nintendo DS with a camera, such as a Nintendo DSi or a later model, the camera may be used to scan QR codes found online or in magazines to obtain in-game items.|$|E
5|$|Dearly Stars {{is a life}} {{simulation}} game {{in which}} the player assumes the role of one of three pop idols at a time: Ai Hidaka, Eri Mizutani or Ryō Akizuki. An idol's statistics are divided into three categories: vocal, dance and visual image. As these increase, an idol's overall image level will also increase. The game is largely divided into two modes: a story mode which encompasses normal gameplay, and a separate <b>stage</b> <b>mode</b> for performing songs outside of the story mode. At the start of every in-game week on Monday, the player is shown current popularity trends in vocal, dance and visual image ranked first, second and third in popularity. This gives the player a guide on how to gain popularity by augmenting an idol's statistics via the choice of song they will perform and what costumes they wear during an audition. Also on Monday, the player is first given the option to choose which costume and accessories to wear for performances, and to choose one of the available songs. Each costume, accessory and song have either a vocal, dance or visual attribute. The player can also modify the choreography and camera positioning used during performances at this time.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other games}} in the genre, the player plays the main portion of Shiny Festa gameplay, <b>Stage</b> <b>mode,</b> {{as he or she}} listens to a {{selected}} song. Each song's performance is limited to a predetermined idol or group of idols, unlike the franchise's previous games. During a song, a predetermined sequence of note icons scroll along several lines, called Melody Lines, toward a central target icon. To complete a song, the player must press buttons that correspond to the direction from which the notes originate from—the buttons on the console's left and right halves for the PlayStation Portable version, and the left and right halves of the screen for the iOS version—as they pass over the target icon. The player is scored by these presses' accuracy in timing and direction, for which he or she is given one of four ratings: Perfect, Good, Normal, and Bad. The player's performance is also represented by the Sparkle Meter, which increases or decreases as the player successfully or fails to hit a note. Throughout the song, new target icons and lines may spawn at predetermined times in different locations of the screen to supersede or accompany old ones. The note sequences may also include Long Icons, which are streaks of notes that need to be continuously held down; Simultaneous Icons, which are pairs of icons that pass over the target icon simultaneously; and Shooting Stars, which appears once the Sparkle Meter is filled, and causes a Shining Burst that raises the player's score and changes the song's accompanying music video when it is hit. The complexity of the song's sequence varies based on the player's selected difficulty for the song; there are four difficulty levels: Debut, Normal, Pro, and Master from the easiest to the hardest.|$|E

50|$|Snake Mode {{plays out}} {{the same way as}} Endless Mode, with the {{exception}} that the rotozoan has only one tentacle, whereas {{the other half of the}} organism is translucent. The translucent side can then be used to destroy goobugs upon impact, giving the player an advantage. In snake Mode, too, the player plays for points under the same directions as in Endless Mode, where the highest score achieved will be recorded and displayed on the title screen. Uniquely to Snake Mode, however, the goobugs that are in contrast to the colour of the rotozoan's tentacle will appear in various colours that are not present in any other mode, including deep blue, magenta and orange. Another unique feature about Snake Mode is the option to unlock and switch between themes. Once the player has managed to unlock the final stages for each level in <b>Stages</b> <b>Mode,</b> completing these with the All Completed achievement will unlock new themes in Snake Mode. The themes feature a background from <b>Stages</b> <b>Mode,</b> and will also have a preset colour for the rotozoan's tentacle. This way, the player will be rewarded for completing the most difficult sixth and seventh stages of each level in <b>Stages</b> <b>Mode.</b>|$|R

40|$|Stricter {{emission}} limits and low prices for fossil fuels are considerable challenges for biomass combustion technologies. Fraunhofer UMSICHT provides solutions for these challenges with an innovative boiler concept developed {{within the last}} years. The prototype was tested in the combustion center at Fraunhofer UMSICHT. Due to its design the boiler can be operated in different modes as a combi-boiler for solid and gaseous fuels. In the standard mode solid biomass is used as fuel. In case of higher NOX-emissions, switching to the fuel <b>staging</b> <b>mode</b> enables the reduction of these emissions. The experiments {{described in this article}} show that reduction rates of up to 50 % are possible. In low load times or if it makes sense from an economic point of view, the boiler can also be operated with gas only.

Arcade Mode features a save and retry feature that allows players to continue and restart the game from the level they were on. Ranking mode does not feature these options, but allows the player to post his/her score on the online leaderboards. <b>Stage</b> <b>Mode</b> allows the player to replay any stage they have completed.|$|E

5000|$|Julian: The most {{powerful}} fighter in <b>stage</b> <b>mode.</b> He appears {{as the final}} boss in stage 5-5. He has armour which is able to block both fire and ice, and boasts a set of powerful basic attacks. Has an attack similar to Davis', however, {{it is a lot}} weaker. Sends multiple bolts of purple and pink skulls, seeking enemies. Can shoot energy into the sky, damaging anyone near him heavily and flinging them into the sky. Finally, he can shoot a very large bolt that is stoppable only by Henry's powerful arrow, Louis/LouisEX/Henry's wave attack, and John's energy disc/shield, or finally, Firzen's [...] "Firzen Canon" [...] move. It is unblockable. Arguably the best character for 1v1, but not as quick to clear enemy groups as Firzen.|$|E
50|$|Firzen: A user of {{fire and}} ice which proves to be a deadly combination. Shoots a {{continuous}} (as long as mana is paid) long, powerful laser. Very mana-damage effective. Shoots gold energy into the sky, raining down fire and ice, which will seek targets. Firzen can explode, sending icicles in all directions and causing massive damage to anyone close to him. This also creates {{a small amount of}} ice/fire rain. This mega-powerful attack takes a while to charge and uses a lot of mana. When Freeze and Firen fuse, they'll turn into Firzen. When he blocks, most energy bolts are reflected, similar to Jan. He's a boss character in <b>Stage</b> <b>mode</b> and appears at the end of Stage 4-5. Arguably the best character for clearing large numbers of enemies. This character is also presumably based off Gogeta from Dragon Ball although Gogeta's first appearance was fused with Goku and Vegeta in 1995.|$|E
