40|$|Porous SiO 2 <b>scaffolds</b> with {{mesopore}} structure (named as MS <b>scaffolds)</b> {{have been}} proposed as suitable for bone tissue engineering due to their excellent drug-delivery ability; however, the mineralization and cytocompatibility of MS <b>scaffolds</b> are far from optimal for bone tissue engineering, {{and it is also}} unclear how the delivery of drugs from MS <b>scaffolds</b> affects osteoblastic cells. The aims of the present study were to improve the mineralization and cytocompatibility of MS <b>scaffolds</b> by coating mussel-inspired polydopamine on the pore walls of <b>scaffolds.</b> The effects of polydopamine modification on MS <b>scaffolds</b> was investigated with respect to apatite mineralization and the attachment, proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), as was the release profile of the drug dexamethasone (DEX). Our results show that polydopamine can readily coat the pore walls of MS <b>scaffolds</b> and that polydopamine-modified MS <b>scaffolds</b> have a significantly improved apatite-mineralization ability as well as better attachment and proliferation of BMSCs in the <b>scaffolds,</b> compared to controls. Polydopamine modification did not alter the release profile of DEX from MS <b>scaffolds</b> but the sustained delivery of DEX significantly improved alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of BMSCs in the <b>scaffolds.</b> These results suggest that polydopamine modification is a viable option to enhance the bioactivity of bone tissue engineering <b>scaffolds</b> and, further, that DEX-loaded polydopamine MS <b>scaffolds</b> have potential uses as a release system to enhance the osteogenic properties of bone tissue engineering applications...|$|R

An advanced non-linear finite element model with high performance beam-column elements was established to evaluate the load carrying capacities of these <b>scaffolds</b> under idealised boundary conditions. Moreover, in order to provide practical design guidance on the safe and effective use of multi-storey door-type modular steel <b>scaffolds,</b> the structural behaviour of these <b>scaffolds</b> under a wide range of positional and rotational restraints at the top and the bottom of the <b>scaffolds</b> is also examined through an extensive parametric study. It is demonstrated that the load carrying capacities of these <b>scaffolds</b> are sensitive to both the types and the magnitudes of restraints provided at the top and the bottom of the <b>scaffolds,</b> and also to the presence of cross-bracings. Hence, the load carrying capacities of two-storey and three-storey modular steel <b>scaffolds</b> are only 85 and 80 % of those of one-storey modular steel <b>scaffolds</b> respectively.
