His job is never specified but he says he works in an office on his own, which he describes as 'solitary confinement' and that his tasks include filing old photographs for the company brochure.

He is obviously intelligent although not particularly ambitious. He is generally cynical and a little melancholy.

50|$|Much of Benders’ work {{combines}} {{not only}} literary styles, such as lyrical, conceptual, satirical, and absurdist influences; his work also moves across genres, media and modes. Some examples are: his Laibach-inspired performance at a poetry award including an Anti-Prize poem and choreographed chants {{from within the}} audience, and a fake moustache; several submissions to poetry contests intended as playful self-referential critique of poetry institutions and contests as such; Wôld, Wôld, Wôld! (2013) a personalized poetry book, including dedications and assignments to the reader, poems in Dutch and English, concrete poems, images. <b>Stubbing</b> <b>Out</b> a Cigarette on a Nightingale will be Benders’ first English language poetry collection. In 2014, Dutch publisher van Gennep has republished some of Benders’ works that had only been available as self-published prints.|$|E

40|$|Background: Implementation {{of tobacco}} plain {{packaging}} (PP) with larger graphic health warnings (GHWs) in Australia had {{positive effects on}} responses reflecting the specific objectives of the PP policy and on follow-up quitting-related cognitions and behaviours. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine predictive relationships bewteen these proximal and distal outcomes. Methods: A nationally representative sample of Australian adult cigarette smokers completed a baseline survey and a 1 -month follow-up survey within the first year of policy implementation (n(weighted) = 3215). Logistic regression analyses tested whether baseline measures of cigarette appeal, GHW effectiveness, perceived harm and concern/enjoyment predicted each of seven follow-up measures of quitted-related cognitions and behaviours, adjusting for baseline levels of the outcome and covariates. Results: In multivariable models, we found consistent evidence that several baseline measures of GHW effectiveness positively and significantly predicted the likelihood that smokers at follow-up reported thinking about quitting at least daily, intending to quit, having a firm date to quit, <b>stubbing</b> <b>out</b> cigarettes prematurely, stopping oneself from smoking and having attempted to quit. Two of the quitting-related outcomes were also predicted by feeling more smoking-related concern than enjoyment. A smaller number of the appeal variables were prospectively associated with quitting-related outcomes, while believing that brands do not differ in harmlessness did not positively predict any outcomes. Conclusions: These findings provide an initial insight into the pathways through which PP with larger GHWs may lead to changes in smoking behaviour. Future research should examine whether the effects are conditional on individual demographic and smoking characteristics. <br /...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Plain {{packaging}} (PP) {{with larger}} graphic health warnings (GHWs) was implemented in Australia in late 2012. This study examined {{effects of these}} packaging changes on short-term changes in quitting-related cognitions and behaviours. Methods: We used a series of cohorts of Australian adult cigarette smokers originally sourced from a nationally representative cross-sectional tracking survey, followed up approximately 1 month after their baseline interview (n(weighted) = 5441). Logistic regression analyses compared changes in seven quitting-related outcomes over this 1 -month follow-up period for the cohorts surveyed before PP, over the period of transition to PP, and {{during the first year}} of PP, adjusting for baseline levels of the outcome and covariates. Results: Compared to the referent group of smokers who completed their follow-up survey pre-PP, those who were followed-up in the early transition period showed greater increases in rates of stopping themselves from smoking (OR= 1. 51, 95 % CI (1. 08 to 2. 10)) and higher quit attempt rates (OR= 1. 43, 95 % CI (1. 00 to 2. 03)), those followed-up in the late transition period showed greater increases in intentions to quit (OR= 1. 42, 95 % CI (1. 06 to 1. 92)) and pack concealment (OR= 1. 55, 95 % CI (1. 05 to 2. 31)), and those followed- up in the first year of PP showed higher levels of pack concealment (OR= 1. 65, 95 % CI (1. 01 to 2. 72)), more premature <b>stubbing</b> <b>out</b> of cigarettes (OR= 1. 55, 95 % CI (1. 01 to 2. 36)), and higher quit attempt rates (OR= 1. 52, 95 % CI (1. 01 to 2. 30)). Conclusions: These findings provide some of the strongest evidence to date that implementation of PP with larger GHWs was associated with increased rates of quitting cognitions, microindicators of concern and quit attempts among adult cigarette smokers. <br /...|$|E

60|$|King James the First, {{who deserves}} {{more of the}} Church of Ireland than all other princes put together, having the forfeitures of vast tracts {{of land in the}} {{northern}} parts (I think commonly called the escheated counties), having granted some hundred thousand acres of these lands to certain Scotch and English favourites, was prevailed on by some great prelates to grant to some sees in the north, and to many parishes there, certain parcels of land for the augmentation of poor bishoprics, did likewise endow many parishes with glebes for the incumbents, whereof a good number escaped the depredations of 1641 and 1688. These lands, when they were granted by King James, consisted mostly of woody ground, wherewith those parts of this island were then overrun. This is well known, universally allowed, and by some in part remembered; the rest being, in some places, not <b>stubbed</b> <b>out</b> to this day. And the value of the lands was consequently very inconsiderable, till Scotch colonies came over in swarms upon great encouragement to make them habitable; at least for such a race of strong-bodied people, who came hither from their own bleak barren highlands, as it were into a paradise; who soon were able to get straw for their bedding, instead of a bundle of heath spread on the ground, and sprinkled with water. Here, by degrees, they acquired some degree of politeness and civility, from such neighbouring Irish as were still left after Tyrone's last rebellion, and are since grown almost entirely possessors of the north. Thus, at length, the woods being rooted up, the land was brought in, and tilled, and the glebes which could not before yield two-pence an acre, are equal to the best, sometimes affording the minister a good demesne, and some land to let.|$|R
