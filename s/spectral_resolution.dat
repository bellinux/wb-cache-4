CdTe can operate at room temperature allowing the construction of compact detectors {{for a wide variety of}} applications in nuclear spectroscopy. The properties that make CdTe superior for the realization of high performance gamma- and x-ray detectors are high atomic number, large bandgap and high electron mobility ~1100cm2/V·s, which result in high intrinsic μτ (mobility-lifetime) product and therefore high degree of charge collection and excellent <b>spectral</b> <b>resolution.</b> Due to the poor charge transport properties of holes, ~100cm2/V·s, single-carrier-sensing detector geometries are used to produce high resolution spectroscopy; these include coplanar grids, frish-collar detectors and small pixel detectors.|$|E

40|$|<b>Spectral</b> peak <b>resolution</b> was {{investigated}} in normal hearing (NH), hearing impaired (HI), and cochlear implant (CI) listeners. The task involved discriminating between two rippled noise stimuli in which the frequency positions of the log-spaced peaks and valleys were interchanged. The ripple spacing was varied adaptively from 0. 13 to 11. 31 ripples/octave, and the minimum ripple spacing at which a reversal in peak and trough positions could be detected was determined as the <b>spectral</b> peak <b>resolution</b> threshold for each listener. <b>Spectral</b> peak <b>resolution</b> was best, on average, in NH listeners, poorest in CI listeners, and intermediate for HI listeners. There was {{a significant relationship between}} <b>spectral</b> peak <b>resolution</b> and both vowel and consonant recognition in quiet across the three listener groups. The results indicate that the degree of <b>spectral</b> peak <b>resolution</b> required for accurate vowel and consonant recognition in quiet backgrounds is around 4 ripples/octave, and that <b>spectral</b> peak <b>resolution</b> poorer than around 1 – 2 ripples/octave may result in highly degraded speech recognition.

25|$|Planck {{sent this}} result to Rubens, who {{compared}} {{it with his}} and Kurlbaum's observational data {{and found that it}} fitted for all wavelengths remarkably well. On 19 October 1900, Rubens and Kurlbaum briefly reported the fit to the data, and Planck added a short presentation to give a theoretical sketch to account for his formula. Within a week, Rubens and Kurlbaum gave a fuller report of their measurements confirming Planck's law. Their technique for <b>spectral</b> <b>resolution</b> of the longer wavelength radiation was called the residual ray method. The rays were repeatedly reflected from polished crystal surfaces, and the rays that made it {{all the way through the}} process were 'residual', and were of wavelengths preferentially reflected by crystals of suitably specific materials.|$|E
25|$|Nano-FTIR {{was first}} {{described}} in 2005 in a patent by Ocelic and Hillenbrand as Fourier transform spectroscopy of tip-scattered light with an asymmetric spectrometer (i.e. the tip/sample placed {{inside one of}} the interferometer arms). The first realization of s-SNOM with FTIR was demonstrated in 2006 in the laboratory of F. Keilmann using a mid-infrared source based on a simple version of nonlinear difference-frequency generation (DFG). However, the mid-IR spectra in this realization were recorded using dual comb spectroscopy principles, yielding a discrete set of frequencies and thus demonstrating a multiheterodyne imaging technique rather than nano-FTIR. The first continuous spectra were recorded only in 2009 in the same laboratory using a supercontinuum IR beam also obtained by DFG in GaSe upon superimposing two pulsed trains emitted from Er-doped fiber laser. This source further allowed in 2011 for the first assessment of nanoscale-resolved spectra of SiC with excellent quality and <b>spectral</b> <b>resolution.</b> At the same time, Huth et al. in the laboratory of R. Hillenbrand used IR radiation from a simple glowbar source in combination with the principles of Fourier transform spectroscopy, to record IR spectra of p-doped Si and its oxides in a semiconductor device. In the same work the term nano-FTIR was first introduced. However, an insufficient spectral irradiance of glowbar sources limited the applicability of the technique to the detection of strongly-resonant excitations such phonons; and the early supercontinuum IR laser sources, while providing more power, had very narrow bandwidth (<300nbsp&cm−1). Further attempt to improve the spectral power, while retaining the large bandwidth of a glowbar source was made by utilizing the IR radiation from a high temperature argon arc source (also known as plasma source). However, due to lack of commercial availability and rapid development of the IR supercontinium laser sources, plasma sources are not widely utilized in nano-FTIR.|$|E
