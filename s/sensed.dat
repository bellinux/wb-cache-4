40|$|The {{problem of}} {{spectrum}} <b>sensing</b> in bandwidth-constrained cognitive sensor networks with quantised <b>sensing</b> observation is studied. In particular, the quantisation bit budget for achieving performance {{close to that}} of spectrum <b>sensing</b> with raw <b>sensing</b> observation is investigated. Both single-user spectrum <b>sensing</b> and collaborative spectrum <b>sensing</b> schemes are proposed. In single-user spectrum <b>sensing,</b> a sensor quantises its <b>sensing</b> observation and sends the quantised <b>sensing</b> observation to a processing point. The processing point performs spectrum <b>sensing</b> based on the reconstructed <b>sensing</b> observation. In collaborative spectrum <b>sensing,</b> each sensor sends a quantised <b>sensing</b> observation to a processing point and each processing point performs local spectrum <b>sensing</b> based on the reconstructed <b>sensing</b> observation. Then, each processing point sends a binary decision bit to a fusion centre. The fusion centre combines the decision bits by using a counting rule to generate the final spectrum <b>sensing</b> result. The detection probability and the false alarm probability are derived and simulated. The results show that there exists an optimal quantisation bit budget for which the detection probability and the false alarm probability are almost {{the same as those}} in spectrum <b>sensing</b> with raw <b>sensing</b> observation. Compared to existing spectrum <b>sensing</b> schemes with quantised <b>sensing</b> observation, the proposed schemes are more suitable for implementation in cognitive sensor networks.

5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} <b>sensed</b> and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E
40|$|Word <b>Sense</b> Disambiguation aims {{to label}} the <b>sense</b> {{of a word}} that best applies in a given context. Graded word <b>sense</b> {{disambiguation}} relaxes the single label assumption, allowing for multiple <b>sense</b> labels {{with varying degrees of}} applicability. Training multi-label classifiers for such a task requires substantial amounts of annotated data, which is currently not available. We consider an alternate method of annotating graded <b>senses</b> using Word <b>Sense</b> Induction, which automatically learns the <b>senses</b> and their features from corpus properties. Our work proposes three objective to evaluate performance on the graded <b>sense</b> annotation task, and two new methods for mapping between <b>sense</b> inventories using parallel graded <b>sense</b> annotations. We demonstrate that <b>sense</b> induction offers significant promise for accurate graded <b>sense</b> annotation. ...|$|R

5|$|After {{capturing}} the crater, Cherry pushed {{on through the}} village, where his party emerged from among the buildings on the far side. Another stiff fight ensured {{with a group of}} Germans in dug-outs {{by the side of the}} road, before the company was able to meet up with its fellow units which had bypassed the village and were already established to the north and east of the area. Cherry's orders were to fall back into reserve, but he disregarded them as he <b>sensed</b> a counter-attack was forthcoming. At 09:00 on 27 March, the Germans launched a very strong counter-attack under heavy artillery fire. At one point, Cherry noticed that the Germans were firing yellow flares to pinpoint Australian positions to their gunners. He found some of these flares, and fired them away from his position. The German attempts to retake Lagnicourt—at a cost to the 7th Brigade of 377 casualties—raged all day before they abandoned the counterattack.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} road {{vehicles}} to efficiently execute different <b>sensing</b> tasks varies {{because of the}} heterogeneity in their <b>sensing</b> ability and trajectories. Therefore, the data collection <b>sensing</b> task, which requires tempo-spatial <b>sensing</b> data, becomes a serious problem in vehicular <b>sensing</b> systems, particularly those with limited <b>sensing</b> capabilities. A utility-based <b>sensing</b> task decomposition and offloading algorithm is proposed in this paper. The utility function for a task executed by a certain vehicle is built according to the mobility traces and <b>sensing</b> interfaces of the vehicle, {{as well as the}} <b>sensing</b> data type and tempo-spatial coverage requirements of the <b>sensing</b> task. Then, the <b>sensing</b> tasks are decomposed and offloaded to neighboring vehicles according to the utilities of the neighboring vehicles to the decomposed <b>sensing</b> tasks.

She left Hollywood {{to look for}} a stage project, and signed on to star in Philip Barry's new play, The Philadelphia Story. It was tailored to showcase the actress, with the character of socialite Tracy Lord incorporating a mixture of humor, aggression, nervousness, and vulnerability. Howard Hughes, Hepburn's partner at the time, <b>sensed</b> that the play could be her ticket back to Hollywood stardom and bought her the film rights before it even debuted on stage. The Philadelphia Story first toured the United States, to positive reviews, and then opened in New York at the Schubert Theatre on March 28, 1939. It was a big hit, critically and financially, running for 417 performances and then going on a second successful tour.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{had voted}} for Hoover in 1928, {{and he did}} so again in 1932; but in 1936, he voted for the Democrats and Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a {{reaction}} to the economic and social turmoil that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929. With the Great Depression setting in, Hand favored a policy of interventionist central government. He came to accept Frankfurter's view that redistribution of wealth was essential for economic recovery. Hoover resisted this approach, favoring individualism and free enterprise. Roosevelt, on the other hand, promised the voters a New Deal. They elected him on a platform of strong executive leadership and radical economic reform. Hand voted for Roosevelt again in 1940 and 1944, but he remained vigilant on the constitutional dangers of big government. Like others, including Walter Lippmann, he <b>sensed</b> the dictatorial potential of New Deal policies. He had no hesitation in condemning Roosevelt's 1937 bill to expand the Supreme Court and pack it with New Dealers.|$|E

Peck was disappointed with the results and gave the dog to Weatherwax in exchange for the money Peck owed him. Weatherwax, in turn, gave the dog to a friend, but when he learned that Eric Knight's 1940 novel, Lassie Come-Home, was being considered as a feature film by MGM, Weatherwax <b>sensed</b> Pal was the dog to fill the role, and bought Pal back from his friend for $10.00 USD. Peck later tried to reclaim him after he became famous as Lassie, but Weatherwax's legal ownership was upheld. Rudd's brother Frank Weatherwax, who trained dogs for such films as The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T and The Wizard of Oz, assisted Rudd in training Pal.|$|E

The project had also gone over budget, spending over 100 million dollars, which was several times the funding that had been publicly reported. By the end of the 1960s, the concept of inspecting Soviet satellites was abandoned as the Soviets had begun installing destruction packages on their satellites, that would blow up both itself and the SAINT, by use of the APO-2 destruction system, which could either be set off by its operators in the USSR, or if it <b>sensed</b> that it was being scanned.

The topics that the two discussed were not ever completely revealed, yet Playford, according to Dunstan, would talk to him in a paternalistic manner. The two built up somewhat of a relationship and developed a respect for each other, but due to the strength of their respective views (Playford was a liberal conservative, Dunstan a libertarian socialist), did not establish the same type of bond that Playford had with earlier Laborites.|$|E

30|$|The {{dissociation}} of <b>sense</b> {{of agency}} and <b>sense</b> of ownership is for sure, but how these two <b>senses</b> {{interact with each}} other is not clear enough. Data from behavioral experiments support the additive model, which indicates that <b>sense</b> of agency seems to promote the integration of the <b>sense</b> of ownership, pure <b>sense</b> of ownership is fragmentary, and <b>sense</b> of agency can integrate different body parts into a continuum and form a unified body awareness (Tsakiris, Prabhu, & Haggard, 2006; Synofzik et al, 2008; Stein, 1964). However, brain imaging experiments are more supportive of the independent model, according to which <b>sense</b> of agency and <b>sense</b> of ownership are essentially different experiences, triggered by different inputs, and using different brain networks, there is no direct overlap (Tsakiris, Longo, & Haggard, 2010). From our point of view, such inconsistency may lie in the experimental design. Since we usually experience <b>sense</b> of agency with <b>sense</b> of ownership, the role of these two types of experiences may not be separated in normal behavioral experiments. Through our research, we can find that when <b>sense</b> of agency and <b>sense</b> of ownership were properly separated, the results obtained are consistent with the hypothesis proposed by the independent model. However, our findings do not support claims that <b>sense</b> of agency and <b>sense</b> of ownership have no interactions.
