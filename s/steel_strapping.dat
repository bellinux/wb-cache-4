Steel is used for heavy duty holding where high strength and minimal stretch are desired. Surface finishes for steel strap include: paint, paint and wax, bluing or zinc and wax.

Common applications include steel coils, bundles of metal, baling wire, bricks and pavers, and roll end-binding. <b>Steel</b> <b>Strapping</b> is sold by weight rather than length, due to the natural expansion and contraction of steel in the manufacturing process.

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} high {{strength}} concrete (HSC) has become increasingly popular {{in the construction of}} buildings and infra-structures. The utilization of HSC has been spurred on by the superior mechanical properties of the material and its cost-effectiveness. However, HSC tends to be more brittle or less tough than normal strength concrete. Therefore, external confinements are used to overcome and enhance the concrete characteristics.

40|$|Fact sheet {{written for}} the Inventions and Innovation Program about a new method for making <b>steel</b> <b>strapping</b> and strip from rod stock {{produced}} from scrap steel. There is a large movement in the American steel industry to utilize more recycled steel. Recycled steel melted in the electric arc furnaces of mini-mills is being used {{as the source of}} raw materials for an increasing number of products, largely due to its lower price. However, conventional processes for producing <b>steel</b> <b>strapping</b> and cold-rolled strip steel restrict manufacturers from using more than 50 % recycled steel. In addition, <b>steel</b> <b>strapping</b> and cold-rolled strip steel traditionally require many production steps. They are produced from primary steel that has been cast into slab, heated, rolled to achieve the desired thickness, and slit to the desired width. The slitting process produces microcracks {{along the edge of the}} strapping or strip, which reduce tensile strength. A new continuous process produces <b>steel</b> <b>strapping</b> and 1 / 2 inch to 6 inch strip steel from the rod and strip stock made from scrap steel in mini-mills. The new process creates <b>steel</b> <b>strapping</b> and strip with improved strength and quality due to the absence of microcracks caused by the conventional slitting process. The finished product is cheaper because of the lower cost associated with using rod ad lower conversion costs. In addition, the higher tensile strength of the product allows for thinner strapping. The process represents a new approach to producing any <b>steel</b> <b>strapping</b> used for bundling and packaging items for storage or transport. In addition, this innovative new process can be used to produce cold-rolled strip steel, a basic raw material for automobile parts, hardware, office equipment, and many other products...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{study is to}} introduce and investigate an effective technique of external pre-tensioning using <b>steel</b> <b>strapping</b> (SSTT) to reduce the brittleness and enhance the ductility of high-strength concrete cylinders. Fifteen cylinders with dimension of 150 mm and 300 mm in diameter and height respectively were casted, pre-tensioned with two and four layers of <b>steel</b> <b>strapping</b> and tested to failure under uniaxial monotonic and cyclic compression. The behaviour of SSTT confined cylinders was studied through their stress-strain relationship upon the longitudinal deflection, transverse strain, mode of failure, confinement ratio, and existence of an envelope curve.

The envelope curve of uniaxial cyclic loading also coincides with the corresponding monotonic loading curve, regardless of any loading activity.

The performance of SSTT-type confined specimens were studied through their stress-strain relationship upon the longitudinal and transverse deformation, mode of failure, level of lateral pre-tensioning stress, etc. The results show that SSTT-type confinement would significantly controlled the brittleness problem of high-strength concrete and at the same time, enhancing both ultimate compressive strength and ductility up to 65 % and 344 %, 36 % and 269 % for both SSTT(HC) and SSTT(SS), respectively.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an affordable}} and effective lateral confinement technique to enhance concrete's compressive {{strength and ductility}} - the <b>steel</b> <b>strapping</b> tensioning technique (SSTT). Considerable {{studies have been done}} on the characteristics of SSTT-confined concrete under uniaxial monotonic compression loading, but none has addressed its uniaxial cyclic response. In this paper, 21 high-strength concrete specimens having diameter of 150 mm and height of 300 mm had been cast, laterally pre-tensioned with steel straps in different confining ratios, and tested to failure under uniaxial cyclic and monotonic compression loadings. Results indicated that the basic hypothesis of envelope curve is valid for SSTT-confined high-strength concrete specimens for uniaxial monotonic and cyclic loadings. The development of plastic strain is independent of the confining ratio when the envelope unloading strain exceeds 0. 0025. Moreover, SSTT-confinement has the lowest plastic strain compared to several related existing plastic strain models. The stress deterioration ratio is independent of confining ratio and loading patterns. Lastly, the concept which neglects the effect of loading history on the permanent axial strain of the unloading and reloading paths of concrete is invalid because repeated unloading/reloading cycles have demonstrated a cumulative effect on the permanent strain and stress deterioration...|$|E
40|$|Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} as an excellent material to strengthen existing structures. However, the confinement efficiency of FRP-confined square columns is relatively low compared to circular columns due to stress concentration at the sharp corners. This study presents a new technique aimed to maximise the efficiency of FRP confinement of square concrete columns. This new method is circularisation by using segmental circular concrete covers which changes the {{cross section of the}} column from a square to a circle. Moreover, <b>steel</b> <b>straps</b> were used as an alternative confining material and incorporated in the study to evaluate their performance. Sixteen square reinforced concrete columns were cast and tested. Four specimens were used as a reference group; four specimens were rounded 20 mm at each corner and wrapped with three layers of CFRP simulating the conventional methods; the remaining eight specimens were bonded with four pieces of segmental circular concrete covers simulating the proposed technique, after which four specimens were wrapped with three layers of CFRP and the other four were confined with <b>steel</b> <b>straps.</b> From each group, one column was tested under concentric loading, one at 15 mm eccentricity, one at 25 mm eccentricity and the last specimen was tested under flexural loading. The failure mechanisms of each specimen were analysed and the load –deflection diagrams and axial load -bending moment diagrams were generated and evaluated. Followed by the experimental program, a theoretical study was carried out. An analytical model was first introduced to evaluate the stress -strain relationships of the unconfined and confined concrete columns. After that, a process was proposed to calculate the ultimate axial load and bending moment of the columns at different eccentricities and generate the theoretical axial load -bending moment diagrams. The theoretical values were then compared with the experimental data and good agreement was found. Results of the experimental program and the theoretical study showed that circularisation significantly increases the efficiency of the FRP confinement compared to conventional methods which round the sharp corners. FRP-confined circularised columns exhibited higher ultimate load but lower ductility compared to normal FRP-confined columns. The bond between the segmental circular concrete covers and the original columns was found to be reliable and the modified columns can be treated as complete circular columns. It is therefore concluded that the circularisation process is viable and effective in maximising the confining efficiency of FRP-confined square concrete columns. Meanwhile, <b>steel</b> <b>straps</b> had been demonstrated as an alternate confining material by providing moderate increase in ductility. Therefore, <b>steel</b> <b>straps</b> can be used for ductility strengthening...|$|R
