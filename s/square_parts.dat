50|$|The most {{prominent}} architectural element, the roof, {{consists of two}} <b>square</b> <b>parts,</b> each side having a surface of 12 x 12 m. The total ground surface measures 12 x 26.3 m, consisting of welded metal sheets and having a weight of 40 tons. The roof was prefabricated and thereafter, in the biggest possible units, transported to the building site, where it was assembled on the ground. The two finally welded parts of the roof were then lifted to their final height (9 m) by a crane and fixed on the pillars. With the frame thus completed, the construction process benefited from the independent roof protection which {{was at that time}} already in its proper place. It consists of cubes 2.26 x 2.26 m which were assembled on the site. Walls, windows, ceilings and floors were then screwed onto the steel frame. The walls consist of enamelled panels measuring 1.13 m x 2.26 m. The placing of these enamel panels was planned according to a particular rhythmic system. Finally, the entire building complex was placed on a concrete ground floor. The building has two floors - five single-storied and one double-storied rooms. When constructing the building complex, more than 20,000 bolts were used.|$|E

40|$|A {{technique}} is described for assembly of multiple batches of micro components onto a single substrate. The substrate is prepared with hydrophobic alkanethiol-coated gold binding sites. To perform assembly, a hydrocarbon oil, which {{is applied to}} the substrate, wets exclusively the hydrophobic binding sites in water. Micro components are then added to the water, and assembled on the oil-wetted binding sites. Moreover, assembly can be controlled to take place on desired binding sites by using an electrochemical method to deactivate specific substrate binding sites. By repeatedly applying this technique, different batches of micro components can be sequentially assembled to a single substrate. As a post assembly procedure, electroplating is incorporated into the technique to establish electrical connections for assembled components. Important issues presented are: substrate fabrication techniques, electrochemical modulation by using a suitable alkanethiol (dodecanethiol), electroplating of tin and lead alloy and binding site design simulations. Finally, we demonstrate a two-batch assembly of silicon <b>square</b> <b>parts,</b> and establishing electrical connectivity for assembled surface-mount light emitting diodes (LEDs) by electroplating...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} a novel method to achieve high yield assembly of millimeter-scale thin silicon chips from an air-water interface. Surface functionalized silicon parts assemble in preprogrammed hydrophilic locations on an assembly substrate with self-alignment. The process and design factors is systematically analyzed and optimized using DOE (Design of Experiment) that leads to high yield. First, a novel fluidic self-assembly (FSA) at the air-water interface is introduced. An experimental and theoretical study of a high yield self-assembly process with a surface programmable template is undertaken and modeled. An analysis of the fluidic self-assembly method at an air-water interface is presented {{with an emphasis on}} the combined effect of a substrate tilting angle and part size. For 1 × 1, 3 × 3 and 5 × 5 mm 2 parts with 100 µm thickness, the substrate tilting angles for effective assembly are experimentally determined and the surface tension induced torques are derived based on a newly developed model. The result indicates that there is a limit on the lateral size of the parts that can be assembled when only one substrate tilting angle is used. Based on the analysis, a novel method, which is capable of assembling parts of higher lateral dimensions using parametric changes in the substrate tilting angle, is proposed. Due to no control over the rotational angle, <b>square</b> <b>parts</b> are assembled in four possible orientations (0 °, 90 °, 180 °, 270 °) due to their square shape. The FSA method is improved to achieve orientation-specific self-assembly of millimeter-scale thin parts by adding magnetic materials. The effect of magnetic force is analyzed and a critical magnetic force that guarantees successful assembly is systematically derived. For various gap values between a magnet and Ni patterned parts, magnetic force distributions are generated using Monte-Carlo simulation and employed to predict assembly yield. An analysis of these distributions shows that a decline in yield following the probability density function can be expected with degrading conditions. The experimentally determined critical magnetic force is in good agreement with a derived value from a model of competing forces acting on a part. A general set of design guidelines is also presented from the developed model and experimental data. Based on the analysis of the magnetic force, the parallel heterogeneous assembly system is developed. The assembly system selectively assembles appropriate parts at corresponding sites from a mixed collection of 2000 × 2000 × 100 and 4000 × 4000 × 100 µm 3 parts using a single pull-up process. Statistical analysis of the distributions of magnetic forces delimits the suitable range for the strength of Faraday waves to fix non-optimal initial placements and orientations. Besides the square patterned parts, orientation-specific assembly of thin circular parts (diameter = 2 mm, thickness = 100 µm) is demonstrated. Components for optics (camera, microlens on photovoltaic cells), sensors, actuators and MEMS devices are often in circular shape because of simple and symmetric design. Thus, the assembly of thin circular parts in unique orientation is required to fully take advantage of 3 D integration. Large deviation of rotation angle of parts is improved by optimizing magnet position through the analysis of in-plane magnetic fields, which induces the dominant force after the parts are placed in the trench. The effect of fluid viscosity on FSA is described through experimental and analytical approaches. The assembly method is classified and viscosity-dependent processes (approach, rotation) are investigated. The detailed effect of viscosity on assembly speed and yield is studied using a derived modeling equation and experimental results. The effect of the feedback control as well as its dependence on the fluid viscosity is analyzed. As extension of 2 D self-assembly, the first proof-of-concept of 3 D integration using the proposed FSA of chip-scale parts (100 µm thickness) is presented. 3 D integration is achieved by assembling new parts over previously assembled parts. Assembly proceeds as an assembly substrate is pulled up through an air-water interface and electrical and mechanical bonding is achieved through a solder reflow process. The maximum number of layers that can be achieved is simulated and analyzed. Via resistance including the effect of degradation of solder over repeated reflow process is measured. Inspired by the analysis of the response of the parts to the magnetic field, a novel self-assembly of a 3 D structure by controlling the folding angle through the analysis of the magnetic field is realized. The tendency of ferromagnetic thin Ni patterns to align along magnetic flux triggers self-folding after the capillary force is diminished. Two strategies to control the folding angle are presented with experimental results. As a proof of concept, a millimeter-scale bus (folding angle = 90 °) and 3 D pyramid shaped (folding angle > 90 °) is assembled. As a potential application, a pyramid shaped 3 D photovoltaic cell is proposed to increase light absorption by trapping the reflected light...|$|E
