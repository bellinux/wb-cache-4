40|$|The optical {{correlator}} {{described in}} this report is intended {{to serve as an}} attention-focusing processor. The objective is to narrowly bracket the range of a parameter value that characterizes the correlator input. The input is a waveform collected by a <b>satellite-borne</b> <b>receiver.</b> In the correlator, this waveform is simultaneously correlated with an ensemble of ionosphere impulse-response functions, each corresponding to a different total-electron-count (TEC) value. We have found that correlation is an effective method of bracketing the range of TEC values likely to be represented by the input waveform. High accuracy in a computational sense is not required of the correlator. Binarization of the impulse-response functions and the input waveforms prior to correlation results in a lower correlation-peak-to-background-fluctuation (signal-to-noise) ratio than the peak that is obtained when all waveforms retain their grayscale values. The results presented in this report were obtained by means of an acousto-optic correlator previously developed at SNL as well as by simulation. An optical-processor architecture optimized for 1 D correlation of long waveforms characteristic of this application is described. Discussions of correlator components, such as optics, acousto-optic cells, digital micromirror devices, laser diodes, and VCSELs are included...|$|E

Particular attention {{is given to}} the method of using <b>satellite-borne</b> <b>receivers</b> for determining the position of animals or other objects carrying fixed-frequency transmitters.

40|$|Automatic {{dependent}} surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) is {{a system}} in which aircraft continually transmit their identity and GPS-derived navigational information. ADS-B networks for air traffic monitoring have already been implemented in areas around the world, but ground stations cannot be installed in midocean and are difficult to maintain in the Arctic, leaving a coverage gap for oceanic and high latitude airspace. A potential solution for worldwide tracking of aircraft is through the monitoring of aircraft-transmitted ADS-B signals using <b>satellite-borne</b> <b>receivers.</b> To investigate this possibility, a high altitude balloon experiment was carried out in June 2009 to determine if ADS-B signals can be detected from near space. The Flying Laboratory for the Observation of ADS-B Transmissions (FLOAT) was the first stratospheric platform to collect ADS-B data. The FLOAT mission successfully demonstrated the reception of ADS-B signals from near space, paving the way {{to the development of a}} space-based ADS-B system...|$|R
40|$|Complete {{descriptions}} of {{spatial and temporal}} distributions of the ionosphere are obtained using a real-time ionospheric characterization (RTIC) system developed at CRS (and described by Ganguly and Brown, 2001). The system accepts data from various sources, regions, and times, then assimilates these data {{within the framework of}} physical ionospheric models, providing a 4 -D description of the ionosphere anywhere in the world. A framework for data-fusion using an ionospheric model was demonstrated by Ganguly (1990, 1991). Most recently, this technique has been extended to incorporate a variety of data, including total electron content (TEC) observation from ground- or <b>satellite-borne</b> <b>receivers</b> and beacons, oblique and vertical sounders, radar, radio propagation, incoherent scatter, optical observations, and in situ measurements. Currently, the RTIC system is being integrated with internet services in order to access a variety of data and user applications. We describe the salient features of the system...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a reliable submillimeter wave spectrometer for space-borne high frequency spectral line work. The emphasis was on improving the efficiency of frequency multipliers to limit the system components to rugged, low power consumption solid-state devices. This research has allowed Millitech to develop increased efficiency and performance in Millitech's existing line of submillimeter components and systems. Millitech has fabricated and tested a complete solid-state spectrometer front end for use at 560 GHz (the 1 (sub 10) to 1 (sub 01) transition of water vapor). The spectrometer was designed with the rigors of flight conditions in mind. The spectrometer uses a phase-locked, solid-state Gunn diode oscillator as the local oscillator, employing a tripler to produce about 3 mW of power at 285 GHz, and a low noise second harmonic waveguide mixer which requires less than 2 mW of LO power. The LO (and the signal) is injected into the mixer by means of a quasioptical diplexer. The measured system noise temperature is 2800 K (DSB) over 400 MHz. The whole spectrometer front end is compact (21 cm by 21 cm by 24 cm), light (7. 4 kg), and has a power consumption of less than 8 W. Other topics explored in this work include compact frequency agile phase lock loops, optical filters, and InP Gunn oscillators for low noise applications. As a result of this research, the improvement in the design of multipliers and harmonic mixers will allow their use as the LO power for a variety of <b>satellite-borne</b> <b>receivers</b> operating in the 200 to 600 GHz frequency range...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports on}} a {{numerical}} model developed to simulate vertically and horizontally polarized microwave emission from the Earth in the frequency range between 5 and 50 GHz and at various angles of observation, with a lOx 10 (latitude by longitude) spatial resolution, taking into account seasonal variations. The principal motivation of the model is {{the evaluation of the}} noise antenna temperature of telecommunications satellites, which is required to calculate the uplink GIT for <b>satellite-borne</b> <b>receivers.</b> The results of the study, however, prove useful in a number of remote sensing applications. To implement the model, significant types of surface, such as bare soil. nonarboreous vegetation, forests, snow, glacier and sea ice, and ocean, have been identified, and their emissivity properties have been determined by the available theoretical andlor empirical models. The millimeter-wave propagation model of Liebe [1993] has been used to compute the atmospheric contribution. Profiles from actual radio soundings collected during a lO-year period over the globe have been used to take into account major climatic variations. The various contributions from the surface and the atmosphere have been finally combined to obtain the theoretical global brightness temperature of each lOx 10 pixel. The numerical model has been validated by comparing on a pixel-by-pixel basis the theoretical brightness temperature with those measured by the special sensor microwave imager (SSMII) radiometer in the year 1992 at 19. 35, 22. 235, and 37. 0 GHz at the available polarizations. The discrepancies between model and experimental brightness temperatures have been noted, and actions have been taken to reduce the differences. In its present configuration, the global emission model yields brightness temperature estimates which differ all over the Earth by less than 12 K rms from those measured by the SSMII. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{manuscript}} will {{be submitted}} to the journal Monthly Weather Review published by the American Meteorological Society. 2 Abstract Narrow Bipolar Events (NBEs) are a recently studied intracloud electrical-discharge process. It is speculated that an NBE is instigated by the extensive atmospheric shower of an energetic cosmic ray. NBEs cause significant relaxation of the charge separation within the electrified cloud in a short time, {{on the order of}} 10 ms. The current flow causes radiation of a distinctive “bipolar ” low-frequency/very-low-frequency signal that can be recorded at locations on Earth up to thousands of km from the source. NBEs are preceded/accompanied by the most powerful very-high-frequency radio emissions seen in any kind of lightning. These intense pulsed radio emissions have been routinely detected with <b>satellite-borne</b> radio <b>receivers</b> in space. Owing to their easy detection and recognition, NBEs might be a useful remote-sensing proxy for space-based global, near-real-time remote sensing. However, in order for that potential to be realized, NBEs must be shown to be associated, as is ordinary lightning, with severe tropospheric convection...|$|R
30|$|The satellite-borne GNSS {{technique}} has {{the advantages of}} rich GNSS satellite constellation (simultaneous tracked by multiple satellites) and continuity (high-precision and real-time tracking of LEO satellites) (Li et al. 2009). The satellite-borne GNSS {{technique has}} gradually been the primary method of precise orbit determination (POD) for LEO satellites (Švehla and Rothacher 2003; Guo et al. 2012). Kinematics, dynamics and reduced dynamics are the main three methods of LEO satellite POD (Švehla and Rothacher 2003; Li et al. 2009; Guo et al. 2013; Zehentner and Mayer-Gürr 2016). With the performance improvement in the <b>satellite-borne</b> GNSS <b>receiver,</b> the kinematic method can substantially obtain the same results as the reduced dynamic method. As long as the continuous tracking data of GNSS satellites are collected, a kinematic orbit with a relatively high accuracy can be guaranteed (Li et al. 2009; Guo et al. 2013; Zehentner and Mayer-Gürr 2016). For LEO satellites, the kinematic orbit and corresponding variance and covariance information can be applied directly to restore the Earth’s gravitational field. It {{can also be used}} to refine the atmospheric density and the other related physical models (Švehla and Rothacher 2003; Zehentner and Mayer-Gürr 2016; Tseng et al. 2017). The kinematic method is very suitable for LEO satellites POD such as GOCE, GRACE and CHAMP (Li et al. 2009; Zehentner and Mayer-Gürr 2016).|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{whistler}} mode waves, predominantly in the form of ELF/VLF chorus, are generated by electrons injected into the magnetosphere during geomagnetic storms and substorms, e. g. [1]. Recently evidence has been found suggesting that this chorus {{may play a role in}} the poorly understood acceleration process which produces electron fluxes in the relativistic energy range (~MeV), sometimes known as "killer electrons " which can damage space systems in space weather events, e. g. [2, 3]. In order to investigate this hypothesis further, it is necessary to have good quantitative information about the intensity of chorus, and its spatial distribution and time evolution before, during, and after such events. While such data can be and has been successfully gathered by <b>satellite-borne</b> wave <b>receivers,</b> ground wave data provide an alternative and complementary view of magnetospheric chorus activity. Space-borne receivers record the waves at a point in space generally moving in L and latitude along the satellite orbit. In contrast, a ground VLF station can detect waves from a large volume of the magnetosphere (typically a few L by 1 - 2 h in local time) at a fixed latitude and longitude for extended time intervals, and usually with higher time resolution and more continuously than is possible in space. A further difference is that whistler mode waves such as chorus which are observed in space will normally be non-ducted, whereas chorus from the same source regions seen on the ground will have propagated mainly in ducted mode. A disadvantage of ground observations is that a model of propagatio...|$|R
