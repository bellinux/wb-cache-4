SUMMARY: The 2006 Clarendon <b>Sector</b> <b>Plan</b> – Part 2 is the proposed final document that has been integrated with Part 1 of the <b>sector</b> <b>plan,</b> adopted by the County Board on June 10, 2006. The final document (see Attachment 1) includes new recommendations on transportation, parking, urban design, and an implementation matrix (see Attachment 4) that contains strategies and actions to implement the policies in the plan. In addition, as a follow-up to Part 1, staff is recommending new open space locations and street alignments in the western end of Clarendon. Staff prefers Option 1 (see Attachment 2) and recommends that it be included in the adopted <b>sector</b> <b>plan</b> as the preferred concept as shown in the attached document. These recommendations are based on two options that were advertised by the County Board on November 14, 2006 (see Attachments 2 and 3).

40|$|We {{describe}} the pension plan {{features of the}} states and the largest cities and counties in the U. S. Unlike in the private sector, defined benefit (DB) pensions are still the norm in the public sector. However, a few jurisdictions have shifted towards defined contribution (DC) plans as their primary savings plan, and fiscal pressures are likely to generate more movement in this direction. Holding fixed a public employee‘s work and salary history, we show that DB retirement income replacement ratios vary greatly across jurisdictions. This creates large variation in workers‘ need to save for retirement in other accounts. There is also substantial heterogeneity across jurisdictions in the savings generated in primary DC plans because of differences in the level of mandatory employer and employee contributions. One notable difference between public and private <b>sector</b> DC <b>plans</b> is that public <b>sector</b> primary DC <b>plans</b> are characterized by required employee or employer contributions (or both), whereas private <b>sector</b> <b>plans</b> largely feature voluntary employee contributions that are supplemented by an employer match.

50|$|In the United States, Federal public <b>sector</b> <b>plans</b> {{are governed}} by the Internal Revenue Code and Federal law, while state and local public <b>sector</b> <b>plans</b> {{are governed by}} the Internal Revenue Code and state law. Thus the funding requirements, benefits, plan solvency, and {{participant}} rights and obligations vary significantly.

40|$|Background: A common {{challenge}} for health <b>sector</b> <b>planning</b> and budgeting {{has been the}} misalignment between policies, technical planning and budgetary allocation; and inadequate community involvement in priority setting. Health system decentralisation has often been promoted to address health <b>sector</b> <b>planning</b> and budgeting challenges through promoting community participation, accountability, and technical efficiency in resource management. In 2010, Kenya passed a new constitution that introduced 47 semi-autonomous devolved county governments, and a substantial transfer of responsibility for healthcare from the central government to these counties. Methods: This study analysed {{the effects of this}} major political decentralization on health <b>sector</b> <b>planning,</b> budgeting and overall financial management at county level. We used a qualitative, case study design focusing on Kilifi County, and were guided by a conceptual framework which drew on decentralisation and policy analysis theories. Qualitative data were collected through document reviews, key informant interviews, and participant and non-participant observations conducted over an eighteen months’ period. Results: We found that the implementation of devolution created an opportunity for local level prioritisation and community involvement in health <b>sector</b> <b>planning</b> and budgeting hence increasing opportunities for equity in local level resource allocation. However, this opportunity was not harnessed due to accelerated transfer of functions to counties before county level capacity had been established to undertake the decentralised functions. We also observed some indication of re-centralisation of financial management from health facility to county level. Conclusion: We conclude by arguing that, to enhance the benefits of decentralised health systems, resource allocation, priority setting and financial management functions between central and decentralised units are guided by considerations around decision space, organisational structure and capacity, and accountability. In acknowledging the political nature of decentralisation polices, we recommend that health sector policy actors develop a broad understanding of the countries’ political context when designing and implementing technical strategies for health sector decentralisation...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{reflection}} of my work as an employee of the Resource Center for Raza Planning and Project Manager for the Isleta Boulevard and Village Centers <b>Sector</b> Development <b>Plan,</b> which began in the summer of 2004 and continues today. In combination with the <b>sector</b> <b>plan</b> draft that was submitted to Bernalillo County in July 2005, this paper also serves as my professional project for the partial fulfillment of a master’s degree in Community and Regional Planning at the University of New Mexico. In this reflection, I examine the role of the Resource Center for Raza Planning (RCRP) as a “reflective intermediary” between the community and the government throughout the planning process for the Isleta Boulevard and Village Centers <b>Sector</b> Development <b>Plan.</b> I consider the outcome of the County Planning Commission (CPC) hearing on September 7, 2005 through the lens of a reflective practitioner, community-based planner, and member of a community-focused organization. First, I begin by introducing RCRP and the planning process for the Isleta Boulevard and Village Centers <b>Sector</b> Development <b>Plan.</b> Then I examine RCRP’s identity as a “reflective intermediary” and explore how the term describes RCRP, its staff and its work. Next, I {{take a close look at}} the CPC hearing and consider the reasons for the one-year deferral of the <b>sector</b> <b>plan.</b> I review some happenings post-CPC hearing and what they can teach RCRP about its practice. Next, I look at ways to move beyond the CRP hearing and pass the <b>sector</b> <b>plan.</b> Finally, I consider RCRP as an organization and offer some thoughts about its direction and future as a successful organization hoping to continue positively impacting grassroots communities in New Mexico. I end with what I hope could be a new objective for RCRP that would reaffirm its organizational principles and allow RCRP to continue enacting true, long-lasting change in New Mexico’s traditional communities. In this time of transition for RCRP, when the organization is facing changing leadership and a staff that is constantly in flux, this analysis looks at how an organization like RCRP can stay true to its founding principles and staff of reflective practitioners while operating effectively in mainstream settings that require technical expertise and instruction. The analytical framework for examining RCRP’s reflective intermediary status come from the experience of developing the Isleta Boulevard <b>sector</b> <b>plan</b> and understanding RCRP’s role through the lens of Donald A. Schön’s classic The Reflective Practitioner: How Professionals think in Action. I hope the outcome of this analysis will offer insights for future planning processes that RCRP might undertake as it examines how to best manage a planning process when the typical constants like the myth of expertise are not espoused. For future RCRP projects, those answers lie not in changing its organizational structure of philosophy, but in better relating to and acting within the traditional structures that still govern politics and in changing the way outsiders view expertise, professionalism, and capacity...|$|R
