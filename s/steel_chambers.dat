60|$|The {{sky above}} the indistinct horizons of this cloud sea {{was at first}} starry and then paler with a light that crept from north to east as the dawn came on. The Milky Way was {{invisible}} in the blue, and the lesser stars vanished. The face of the adventurer at the steering-wheel, darkly visible ever and again by the oval greenish glow of the compass face, had something of that firm beauty which all concentrated purpose gives, and something of the happiness of an idiot child that has at last got hold of the matches. His companion, a less imaginative type, sat with his legs spread wide over the long, coffin-shaped box which contained in its compartments the three atomic bombs, the new bombs that would continue to explode indefinitely and which no one so far had ever seen in action. Hitherto Carolinum, their essential substance, had been tested only in almost infinitesimal quantities within <b>steel</b> <b>chambers</b> embedded in lead. Beyond the thought of great destruction slumbering in the black spheres between his legs, and a keen resolve to follow out very exactly the instructions that had been given him, the man's mind was a blank. His aquiline profile against the starlight expressed nothing but a profound gloom.|$|E

30|$|The {{helium gas}} in the chamber was pumped out for about 10  min after the {{discharge}} system was allowed to cool down for about 10  min. After this, the flange that carried all the components in the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>chamber</b> was unbolted and removed.

30|$|First, the two {{electrodes}} in {{the stainless}} <b>steel</b> <b>chamber</b> were setup as represented in Fig.  1 b {{and made to}} be 1 – 2  mm apart. Air inside the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>chamber</b> was pumped out of the chamber using a vacuum pump to a pressure of ≤ 10 − 3  Torr. Helium gas was then introduced into the chamber at a pressure of 200  Torr. Current of 150  A was supplied to the electrodes using the Arc Welding Transformer power supply. The mechanical system was used to push the movable electrode such that the two electrodes were just touching each other and then released. This initiated an arc discharge between the electrodes which resulted to the vaporization of the graphite electrodes. The arc discharge was made to run for about 2  min. While the arc discharge occurs in the chamber, water was made to circulate round between {{the walls of the}} stainless <b>steel</b> <b>chamber</b> cylinder through the water inlet and outlet channels to provide cooling for the chamber.|$|R

50|$|To explore {{even deeper}} depths, deep-sea explorers {{must rely on}} {{specially}} constructed <b>steel</b> <b>chambers</b> to protect them. The American explorer William Beebe, also a naturalist from Columbia University in New York, was the designer of the first practical bathysphere to observe marine species at depths {{that could not be}} reached by a diver. The Bathysphere, a spherical steel vessel, was designed by Beebe and his fellow engineer Otis Barton, an engineer at Harvard University. In 1930 Beebe and Barton reached a depth of 435 m (about 1425 ft), and 923 m (3028 ft) in 1934. The potential danger was that if the cable broke, the occupants could not return to the surface. During the dive, Beebe peered out of a porthole and reported his observations by telephone to Barton who was on the surface.|$|E

40|$|Micromachined {{cryogenic}} coolers can be {{used for}} cooling small electronic devices to improve their performance. However, for reaching cryogenic temperatures, they require a very good thermal insulation from the warm environment. This is established by a vacuum space that for adequate insulation has to be maintained at a pressure of 0. 01 [*]Pa or lower. In this paper, the challenge of maintaining a vacuum chamber with a volume of 3. 6 × 10 − 5 m 3 and an inner wall area of 8. 1 × 10 − 3 m 2 at a pressure no higher than 0. 01 [*]Pa for five years is theoretically analyzed.

40|$|Several Inhaled atmospheres {{were tested}} for {{effects on the}} rat {{respiratory}} defense system. Materials studied included ozone and aerosols of ammonium sulfate, ferric sulfate, and sulfuric acid; relative humidity was also a controlled experimental variable. Each sulfate was studied alone as a submicrometer aerosol at a concentration of 3. 5 mgjm 3 in air and combined with ozone at 0. 8 ppm. Results were compared with those for sham-exposed animals and for rats exposed to ozone alone. Air pollutant exposures, inside stainless <b>steel</b> <b>chambers,</b> were one time only for 4 h. The end points for evaluation of effects were measurements of early and late rates of clearance of radiolabeled Insoluble tracer particles. Tracer particles were Inhaled before air pollutant exposures and particle clearance was followed for about 2 wk. Ozone alone slowed the early (0 - 50 h after exposure) particle clearance and stimulated clearance during the later phase (2 - 17 d). High humidity usually amplified these effects of ozone {{as well as many}} of the other atmospheres studied. Sulfate aerosols alone tended to produce relatively small effects on early or late clearance. Combinations of ozone and aerosols resulted In effects that were similar to those of ozone alone. The data do not support the hypotheses that sulfate aerosols synergize with ozone in altering respiratory tract clearance, sulfuric acid being a probable exception. These data alone cannot be used to predict the overall health effects of the materials studied. © 1980 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the present {{status of the}} PEP-II project. The project comprises four major systems: Injector, High-Energy Ring (HER), Low-Energy Ring (LER), and Interaction Region (IR). We focus in detail {{on the design of}} the LER, as its parameters and requirements are most closely related to those required for the Beijing Tau-Charm Factory rings. The PEP-II LER is a high-current, 3. 1 -GeV positron ring mounted above the 9 -GeV HER. The LER uses a wiggler located in one of its six straight sections to provide emittance control and additional damping. We {{describe the}} rather complicated IR, which must transport the LER beam into the plane of the HER, focus it to a common beam size, and separate the beams after the head-on collisions. Both permanent magnet and conventional electromagnets are used in this area. The LER lattice has now adopted a simplified non-interleaved sextupole correction scheme that has reduced the required number of sextupoles substantially. We describe the LER vacuum system, one of the most challenging subsystems in PEP-II. It employs several technologies. In the arcs, aluminum extrusions and titanium sublimation pumps are employed; the straight sections use stainless <b>steel</b> <b>chambers</b> with lumped ion pumps. In the wiggler area, an extended copper photon dump with nonevaporable getter (NEG) pumps is employed to handle the very large synchrotron radiation power. The design of the room-temperature RF system, the bunch-by-bunch longitudinal and transverse feedback systems, and some of the special diagnostics will be described briefly.
