25|$|On December 11, 2015, DuPont {{announced}} that it would merge with the Dow Chemical Company, in an all-stock deal. The combined company, which will be known as DowDuPont, will have an estimated value of $130 billion, be equally held by the shareholders of both companies, and maintain their headquarters in Delaware and Michigan respectively. Within two years of the merger's closure, expected {{in the first quarter of}} 2017 and subject to regulatory approval, DowDuPont will be split into three separate public companies, focusing on the agricultural chemicals, materials science, and specialty product industries. Commentators have questioned the economic viability of this plan because, of the three companies, only the <b>specialty</b> <b>products</b> industry has prospects for high growth. The outlook on the profitability of the other two proposed companies has been questioned due to reduced crop prices and lower margins on plastics such as polyethylene. They have also noted that the deal is likely to face antitrust scrutiny in several countries. This eventually became the case, with two delays taking place due to regulatory approvals. The merger closed on August 31, 2017.|$|E
500|$|Gulf {{expanded}} on {{a worldwide}} basis {{from the end}} of the Second World War. The company leveraged its international drilling experience to other areas of the world, and by mid-1943 had established a presence in the eastern oil fields of Venezuela as Mene Grande Oil Company. Much of the company's retail sales expansion was through the acquisition of privately owned chains of filling stations in various countries, allowing Gulf outlets to sell product (sometimes through [...] "matching" [...] arrangements) from the oil that it was [...] "lifting" [...] in Canada, the Gulf of Mexico, Kuwait, and Venezuela. Some of these acquisitions were to prove less than resilient in the face of economic and political developments from the 1970s on. Gulf invested heavily in product technology and developed many <b>specialty</b> <b>products,</b> particularly for application in the maritime and aviation engineering sectors. It was particularly noted for its range of lubricants and greases.|$|E

[...] In a Wall Street Journal article dated February 15, 2006, Warren Buffett said, [...] "It's the most successful managerial performance in bankruptcy that I've ever seen."

2500|$|According to Christopher Heyn, [...] "To many long-time viewers, La Femme Nikita {{had always}} been a natural for merchandising. Besides the usual array of T-shirts, jackets, coffee mugs, posters and other trinkets, the action content of the series lends itself {{perfectly}} to the development of video games, comic books, toys and action figures. Yet, during the entire run of the series, Warner Bros. released only one piece of merchandise — the soundtrack CD on TVT Records. [...] Beyond that, there was nothing. This frustrated [...] Rod Perth to no end."(20) Heyn quotes Perth as saying: [...] "'Warner Bros. never had an interest in this show ...'" [...] (20). Nevertheless, Heyn reports, he himself [...] "successfully brokered an official merchandising agreement between the <b>Specialty</b> <b>Products</b> division, a vendor in Toronto that already produced merchandise for the series' cast and crew, and the Sidekicks Society, the organizers of Close Quarters Standby 2," [...] the second in a series of four La Femme Nikita fan conventions held in Toronto in October 1999.(Heyn 20) Such items included jackets, T-shirts, coffee mugs, and keychains emblazoned with the series logo and the copyright notice [...] "©1999, Warner Bros." [...] below the logo (photograph in Heyn 21). [...] "Because of a delivery mixup", Heyn's photo caption reads, [...] "most of the coffee mugs and keychains never made it to the convention in time for sale," [...] and he adds, [...] "The remaining boxes of jackets, T-shirts and coffee mugs sold out in less than an hour, leaving many empty-handed attendees frustrated and upset."(21) Moreover, Heyn observes, [...] "That unfortunate outcome only validated Warner Bros.' reticence to merchandise La Femme Nikita on a larger scale. The studio lost money on the internet broadcast and made next to nothing from the limited merchandising deal, which echoed their attitude toward the series' financial construction."(Heyn 20) ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 38th Parliament of British Columbia the BC NDP, with Trevena, {{formed the}} Official Opposition. She was {{selected}} for the bi-partisan Special Committee on Sustainable Aquaculture to deliver recommendations {{on the development of}} fish farms in BC. NDP leader Carole James assigned Trevena to be the official critic to the Employment and Income Assistance ministry, headed by BC Liberal Claude Richmond. She supported the 2005 review of welfare rates in which she advocated for earning exemptions and opposed the ministry providing welfare recipients with [...] "free socks, T-shirts and travel mugs" [...] in exchange for authorizing direct deposits of welfare cheques into a bank account. She chastised Richmond after an internal survey of ministry employees reported very morale and revealed he was ignoring staff recommendations. On local issues, Trevena lobbied the government to intervene in the bankruptcy of a Port Alice pulp mill. While the mill was 87 {{years old at the time}} and required equipment upgrades and environmental remediation, it also comprised 80% of Port Alice's tax base and was one of only a few mills in the world that produced <b>specialty</b> <b>products</b> using dissolving sulphite pulp; the province eventually directed $800,000 to Port Alice to cover the loss of the 2005 property taxes, facilitated the sale of the mill to a Swiss investment company for $1, and provided $7.5 million for site remediation. When another mill was facing closure (Elk Falls sawmill in February 2008), Minister of Forests Rich Coleman declined to offer provincial assistance but recognized Trevena for her efforts helping keep the Port Alice mill open. Trevena backed the creation of the North Coast Trail through Cape Scott Provincial Park, but opposed efforts at developing private accommodations in the park. During the debate over whether the Vancouver Island Health Authority should build a new hospital or renovate existing facilities in Campbell River and Comox, Trevena campaigned in support of renovating the existing hospitals. When the Health Authority chose to build a new $306-million, 230-bed facility near Courtenay instead, Trevena lobbied Minister of Health George Abbott not to approve the decision, and continued to publicly campaign in support of the renovations. She delivered an 18,775 signature petition to the Legislative Assembly requesting Abbott to not approve the Health Authority's plan; the Health Authority eventually relented and upgraded the two smaller hospitals.|$|E
