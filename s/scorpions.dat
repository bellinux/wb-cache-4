5|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the Chelicerata contain the classes Arachnida (spiders, <b>scorpions,</b> mites, etc.), Xiphosura (horseshoe crabs) and Eurypterida (sea <b>scorpions,</b> extinct). The extinct Chasmataspida may be a sub-group within Eurypterida. The Pycnogonida (sea spiders) were traditionally classified as chelicerates, but some features suggest they may be representatives of the earliest arthropods from which the well-known groups such as chelicerates evolved.|$|E

5|$|Both spiders and <b>scorpions</b> are venomous, {{so their}} threat {{displays}} {{can be considered}} generally aposematic.

5|$|Chelicerates were {{originally}} predators, {{but the group}} has diversified to use all the major feeding strategies: predation, parasitism, herbivory, scavenging and eating decaying organic matter. Although harvestmen can digest solid food, the guts of most modern chelicerates are too narrow for this, and they generally liquidize their food by grinding it with their chelicerae and pedipalps and flooding it with digestive enzymes. To conserve water, air-breathing chelicerates excrete waste as solids that are removed from their blood by Malpighian tubules, structures that also evolved independently in insects. While the marine horseshoe crabs rely on external fertilization, air-breathing chelicerates use internal but usually indirect fertilization. Predatory species generally use elaborate courtship rituals to prevent males from being eaten before they can mate. Most lay eggs that hatch as what look like miniature adults, but all <b>scorpions</b> and a few species of mites keep the eggs inside their bodies until the young emerge. In most chelicerate species the young have to fend for themselves, but in <b>scorpions</b> and some species of spider the females protect and feed their young.|$|E

Some other tags show the <b>scorpion</b> close over a swallow sign, which reads 'the <b>scorpion</b> is great'. One unique tag shows the <b>scorpion</b> holding a long stick, smiting an enemy.

5|$|Other {{terrestrial}} arthropods, such as centipedes, millipedes, <b>scorpions,</b> and spiders, {{are sometimes}} confused with insects since their body plans can appear similar, sharing (as do all arthropods) a jointed exoskeleton.

5|$|The natural diets {{of snakes}} in the {{widespread}} viper genus Echis are highly varied, and include arthropods, such as <b>scorpions,</b> {{as well as}} vertebrates. Various Echis species consume different quantities of arthropods in their diet. A study carried out in 2009 injected <b>scorpions</b> with the venom of various Echis species, and found a high correlation between the proportion of arthropods that the snakes consumed in their natural habitat, and the toxicity of their venom to <b>scorpions.</b> The researchers also found evidence that the evolution of venom more toxic to arthropods was related {{to an increase in}} the proportion of arthropods in the snakes' diet, and that diet and venom may have evolved by a process of coevolution. A phylogeny of the genus constructed using mitochondrial DNA showed that one instance of a change in venom composition in the species ancestral to all Echis snakes was correlated with a shift to an arthropod based diet, whereas another shift in a more recent lineage was correlated with a shift to a diet of vertebrates. Despite the higher toxicity of the venom of arthropod-consuming species, it was not found to incapacitate or kill prey any faster than that of species with fewer arthropods in their diet. Thus, the venom is thought to have evolved to minimize the volume required, as the production of venom carries a significant metabolic cost, thus providing a fitness benefit. This pattern is also found in other lineages. Similar results were obtained by a 2012 study which found that the venom of arthropod-consuming Echis species was more toxic to locusts than that of vertebrate-consuming species.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a notable}} but {{variable}} trend towards fusion of other ganglia into the brain.

In most living arachnids, except <b>scorpions</b> if they are true arachnids, all the ganglia, including those that would normally be in the opisthosoma, are fused into a single mass in the prosoma and there are no ganglia in the opisthosoma. However, in the Mesothelae, which are regarded as the most primitive living spiders, the ganglia of the opisthosoma and the rear part of the prosoma remain unfused, and in <b>scorpions</b> the ganglia of the cephalothorax are fused but the abdomen retains separate pairs of ganglia.|$|E
