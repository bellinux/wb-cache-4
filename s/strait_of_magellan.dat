5|$|Later in 1917, the Argentines had to sharply curtail Rivadavias {{activities}} {{because of}} a fuel shortage, but they voyaged to the United States with the Argentine ambassador in 1918. Rivadavia then took on a load of gold bullion and brought it back to Argentina, docking in Puerto Belgrano on 23 September 1918. In December 1920, Rivadavia participated in ceremonies that marked the 400th anniversary {{of the discovery of}} the <b>Strait</b> <b>of</b> <b>Magellan.</b> On the 2nd, the ship called on Valparaíso in Chile; 25 days later, it took part in an international naval review.

They failed to locate any of the German ships, but Otranto intercepted messages that indicated that German warships were operating in the area. Cradock concentrated his ships on the southwestern coast of South America in mid-October to prevent the East Asia Squadron under Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee from breaking through into the South Atlantic. In mid-October Otranto struck a rock while departing Port Legunas, Chile, but a diver from Monmouth reported that it had done very little damage.|$|E
5|$|Chile, {{facing the}} Pacific Ocean, {{has a large}} British presence. Over 50,000 British {{immigrants}} settled in Chile from 1840 to 1914. A significant number of them settled in Magallanes Province, especially {{in the city of}} Punta Arenas when it flourished as a major global seaport for ships crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the <b>Strait</b> <b>of</b> <b>Magellan.</b> Around 32,000 English settled in Valparaíso, influencing the port city to the extent of making it virtually a British colony during the last decades of the 19th century {{and the beginning of the}} 20th century. However, the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 and the outbreak of the First World War drove many of them away from the city or back to Europe.|$|E

5|$|In {{making his}} {{terrestrial}} globes, Molyneux examined ruttiers (instructions for directions at sea) and pilots (navigational handbooks). He {{is known to}} have given a ruttier for Brazil and the West Indies to Thomas Harriot in 1590. He also received advice and assistance from navigators and mathematicians. It is likely, for instance, that Sir Walter Raleigh advised him on a legend in Spanish about the Solomon Islands that appeared on the terrestrial globe. Raleigh came by the information from Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, a Galician explorer sent by King Philip II of Spain to fortify the <b>Strait</b> <b>of</b> <b>Magellan</b> after Francis Drake had passed through it. In 1584, the Spaniard was Raleigh's guest in London for a few weeks, after being captured by Raleigh on a journey to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Upon recommissioning in mid-1914, she {{was briefly}} {{assigned}} to the 6th Cruiser Squadron in August before being {{assigned to the}} 4th Cruiser Squadron to reinforce Cradock's forces. He transferred his flag to {{her because she was}} faster than his previous flagship. Cradock's command was transferred to the coast of South America later that month at his own suggestion to better hunt for the German ships preying upon British merchant ships. His ships were generally unsuccessful in this and he moved his squadron further south in late September to search for the East Asia Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee, in the vicinity of Cape Horn and the <b>Strait</b> <b>of</b> <b>Magellan</b> in accordance to his orders from the Admiralty.|$|E
5|$|When war was {{declared}} in August 1914, Good Hope {{was ordered to}} reinforce the 4th Cruiser Squadron and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock. Cradock moved the available ships of his squadron later that month to the coast of South America to search for German commerce raiders. He was then ordered further south to the <b>Strait</b> <b>of</b> <b>Magellan</b> to block any attempt of the German East Asia Squadron to penetrate into the South Atlantic. He found the German squadron on 1 November {{off the coast of}} Chile. The German squadron outnumbered Cradock's force and were individually more powerful; they sank Cradock's two armoured cruisers in the Battle of Coronel. Good Hope was lost with all hands.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in August 1591, Hues joined Cavendish {{on another}} attempt to {{circumnavigate}} the globe. Sailing on the Leicester, they were accompanied by the explorer John Davis on the Desire. Cavendish and Davis agreed that they would part company once they had cleared the <b>Strait</b> <b>of</b> <b>Magellan</b> between Chile and Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, as Davis intended to sail to America {{to search for the}} Northwest Passage. The expedition was ultimately unsuccessful, although Davis did discover the Falkland Islands. In the meantime, delayed in small harbours in the Strait with crew members dying from the cold, illness and starvation, Cavendish turned back eastwards to return to England. He was plagued by mutinous crewmen, and also by natives and Portuguese who attacked his sailors seeking food and water on shore. Increasingly depressed, Cavendish died in 1592 somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, possibly a suicide.|$|E
5|$|Some recolonizing {{habitats}} are confirmed, {{especially in}} the North and South Atlantic (e.g. English and Irish coasts, English Channel) to coasts in the north such as the North Sea and Wadden Sea, where the first confirmed sighting since 1755 was made in 2003, South Pacific (e.g. New Zealand coasts and Niue), pelagic islands of Chile such as Isla Salas y Gómez and Easter Island, where possibilities of undocumented wintering grounds have been considered, southern fiords of Chile and Peru (e.g. Gulf of Penas, <b>Strait</b> <b>of</b> <b>Magellan,</b> Beagle Channel) and in Asia. Areas in the Philippines such as the Babuyan Islands, Cagayan (the first modern mortality of the species in the nation was in 2007), Calayan and Pasaleng Bay, the Ryukyu Islands, the Volcano Islands in Japan and the Northern Mariana Islands recently again became stable/growing wintering grounds while the Marshall Islands, Vietnamese, Taiwanese and Chinese coasts show slow or no obvious recovery.|$|E
5|$|As {{the threat}} of a German naval attack had been removed by the {{destruction}} of the East Asia Squadron, Australia was free for deployment elsewhere. Initially, the battlecruiser was to serve as flagship of the West Indies Squadron, with the task of pursuing and destroying any German vessels that evaded North Sea blockades. Australia was ordered to sail to Jamaica via the Panama Canal, but as it was closed to heavy shipping, she was forced to sail down the coast of South America and pass through the <b>Strait</b> <b>of</b> <b>Magellan</b> during 31 December 1914 and 1 January 1915—Australia is the only ship of the RAN to cross from the Pacific to the Atlantic by sailing under South America. During the crossing, one of the warship's propellers was damaged, and she had to limp to the Falkland Islands at half speed. Temporary repairs were made, and Australia departed on 5 January. A vessel well clear of the usual shipping routes was spotted on the afternoon of the next day, and the battlecruiser attempted to pursue, but was hampered by the damaged propeller. Unable to close the gap before sunset, a warning shot was fired from 'A' turret, which caused the ship—the former German passenger liner, now naval auxiliary Eleonora Woermann—to stop and be captured. As Australia could not spare enough personnel to secure and operate the merchant ship, and Eleonora Woermann was too slow {{to keep pace with the}} battlecruiser, the German crew were taken aboard and the ship was sunk.|$|E

40|$|Hydrographic {{features}} and bottom profiles {{along the main}} passages from Paso Ancho in the <b>Straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Magellan</b> to the Beagle Channel and those of adjacent oceanic waters are examined with regard to water origin and circulation. Sills and shallow entrances likely limited water exchange. Adjacent oceanic waters were warmest in the Atlantic and saltiest in the Pacific sectors. Waters within the inland passages were fresher and cooler than open shelf waters, showing a decreasing salinity gradient between the Beagle Channel and the <b>Straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Magellan</b> and a subsurface wedge of warmest and saltiest oceanic water underneath a core of cold and brackish water in Brazo Noroeste. Subsurface water masses <b>of</b> the <b>Straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Magellan</b> and Brazo Noroeste seem to be entrapped. Temperature and density distributions suggest that the inflow of salty and warm Pacific waters takes place through Bahía Cook. Westward and northward toward the <b>Straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Magellan,</b> these waters may progressively mix with cooler and more brackish waters adjacent to Cordillera de Darwin. In this sector (Canal Brecknock-Canal Cockburn) stratification of the water column was weaker and became zero toward the <b>Straits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Magellan</b> (Seno Magdalena / Paso Ancho). Distribution of water properties was consistent with bathymetry profiles and suggests the following subdivision of microbasins along the Magellan-Beagle passage: 1. - Paso Ancho-Seno Magdalena, 2. - Canal Magdalena-Canal Brecknock, 3. - Canal Ballenero-Brazo Noroeste, 4. - Beagle Channel...|$|R
