40|$|Abstract—A {{personal}} computer spreadsheet model which predicts air contaminant concentrations following indoor spills of volatile liquids has been developed. Three mass transfer models are compared for predicting evaporative flux {{in the model}}, the flat plate mass transfer theory, Penetration Theory, and Mackay and Matsugu models. Two methods of predicting <b>spill</b> <b>temperature</b> during evaporation are presented, the isothermal method, which assumes <b>spill</b> <b>temperature</b> remains at ambient throughout evaporation, and the <b>spill</b> <b>temperature</b> method, which predicts <b>spill</b> <b>temperature</b> using equations developed from a heat balance over the spill pool. Dispersion is approximated in the model as a well-mixed room with short-circuiting. Model equations are programmed into a Lotus 1, 2, 3 spreadsheet. Calculations of room concentration, spill pool surface temperature, and spill area are made at consecutive 20 -s intervals following the spill. Model predictions are compared with concentration measurements made after two test spills in a laboratory. The model gives a good first estimate of room concentration, performing best when the spill {{is assumed to be}} isothermal and the Penetration Theory or Mackay and Matsugu methods are used to predict evaporation rate. © 1997 British Occupational Hygiene Society...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} various environmental conditions {{on the behavior of}} a contaminant spill as it travels across the Wachusett Reservoir. The reservoir, located in central Massachusetts, is a 65 billion gallon water body that supplies drinking water to the Boston Metropolitan area and consists of numerous inflows and outflows. The Quabbin Reservoir, a 412 billion gallon system, accounts for close to half of the inflow. The Wachusett Reservoir receives Quabbin water through the Quabbin aqueduct located on its eastern side. CEQUAL W 2, a two-dimensional, laterally averaged, hydrodynamic and water quality model was utilized to perform numerous simulations. The current version, version 3. 6, was used due to its computational speed and ability to apply past years data without changing input files. Four years were analyzed, 2003 - 2006, in order to examine similarities and differences from year to year. Simulations for years 2005 and 2006 were calibrated to measured temperature and conductivity profiles within the North Basin of the Wachusett Reservoir (Years 2003 and 2004 were completed prior to this research). Simulations were performed in order to better understand the behavior of the spill under three main scenarios: 1) seasonal change, 2) variation of <b>spill</b> <b>temperature,</b> and 3) turning the Quabbin transfer on or off. Spill characteristics and location were kept the same for each simulation to allow for comparison. The date of the spill was chosen based on similar wind conditions for each season of every year. The behavior of the spill was evaluated by analyzing conductivity versus time at the withdrawal of the reservoir, the Cosgrove intake. Profiles of conductivity versus water depth at some locations along the reservoir were observed in order to better understand spill behavior. Model results demonstrated that similarities between years existed. The arrival time of the spill was affected by the seasonal change. Spring spills consistently arrived at the withdrawal within 2 - 3 days, fall spills within approximately 7 - 10 days, and summer spills took 10 - 15 days. The summer spills showed more variability, having larger peaks than the other seasons. Changing the temperature of the spill displayed minimal effect for the spring and fall seasons. The summer of 2004 showed a faster arrival time at the intake for a warm spill whereas the summers of 2003, 2005 and 2006 displayed negligible differences in spill behavior when changing the <b>spill</b> <b>temperature.</b> Altering the condition of the Quabbin transfer showed the most effect during the summer months for all four years. Turning the transfer off for a period of two weeks after the significantly. CEQUAL W 2 V 3. 6 proved to be an effective tool in examining the behavior of a contaminant spill within the Wachusett Reservoir under various scenarios. spill caused the variability of spill concentration measured at the withdrawal to dampe...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a reduced air pressure condition on buoyant <b>spilled</b> thermal plume <b>temperature</b> profile from over-ventilated enclosure fires, the same scale model experiments were performed correspondingly in both Hefei city (altitude: 50 m, ambient pressure: 1 atm) and Lhasa city (altitude: 3650 m, ambient pressure: 0. 64 atm). Comparative experimental results for both the lateral (normal to façade) and vertical (along facade) <b>spilled</b> plume <b>temperature</b> profile show that the lateral decay of temperature in the reduced air pressure is much faster than that in the normal air pressure condition. Meanwhile, the normalized <b>spilled</b> thermal plume <b>temperature</b> near the façade wall is much higher in the reduced pressure atmosphere than that in the normal pressure condition at the same height, indicating possibly weaker air entrainment of the buoyant spill plume in reduced pressure. These results reveal that fire safety regulations to counteract the vertical fire spread to upper floors need to be specified more rigorous at high altitude...|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{an analysis of}} ambient aerosols in a southeastern coastal city of China (Xiamen) {{in order to assess}} the temporal variability in the concentrations and sources of organic aerosols (OA). Molecular-level measurements based on a series of solvent extractable lipid compounds reveal inherent heterogeneity in OA, in which the concentration and relative contribution of at least three distinct components (terrestrial plant wax derived, marine/microbial and fossil fuel derived organic matter (OM)) exhibited distinct and systematic temporal variability. Plant wax lipids and associated terrestrial OM are influenced by seasonal variability in plant growth; marine/microbial lipids and associated marine OM are modulated by sea <b>spill</b> and <b>temperature</b> change, whereas fossil fuel derived OM reflects the anthropogenic utilization of fossil fuels originated from petroleum-derived sources and its temporal variation is strongly controlled by meteorological conditions (e. g., the thermal inversion layer), which is analogous to other air organic pollutions. A comparative study among different coastal cities was applied to estimate the supply of different sources of OM to ambient aerosols in different regions, where it was found that biogenic OM in aerosols over Xiamen was much lower than that of other cities; however, petroleum-derived OM exhibited a high level of contribution with a higher concentration of unresolved complex matters (UCM) and higher a ratio between UCM and resolved alkanes (UCM/R) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a semi-analytical {{model has been}} {{developed}} to estimate the amount of oil disappeared from an oil spill floating on seawater surface. The model considers evaporation, dissolution and sedimentation of oil components. Crude oil and wide boiling range fractions are divided into several pseudocomponents using distribution model developed by Riazi (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 36 (10) (1997) 4299 – 4307). Heavy components with densities above density of water, sink {{to the bottom of}} sea while light components vaporize or dissolve into water. In the model, oil spill thickness is considered variable versus time. The input data for the model are distillation data (or composition) for oil, API gravity of oil, initial volume of oil spill, initial area of oil <b>spill,</b> air <b>temperature,</b> wind speed and water surface velocity. The only adjustable parameter is a constant in the relation for the mass transfer coefficient for evaporation. The model estimates area, volume and composition of oil spill versus time. It also calculates the amount of oil vaporized, dissolved or sunk into water versus time. Three sets of experiments were conducted for a Kuwaiti export crude oil and four different Kuwaiti petroleum products also used for export to determine the rate of oil disappearance at ambient temperature. Data obtained in these experiments were used to determine the model parameter a...|$|R
40|$|For spills of {{submerged}} oil, current {{methods are}} inadequate {{to find and}} recover the oil with responders having to reinvent the techniques on each occasion. The Coast Guard R&D Center (RDC) {{has embarked on a}} multi-year project to develop a complete approach for recovery of spills of submerged oils. This paper describes the multi-phased approach which addresses detection of oil on the bottom and development of a recovery system. The designs for three vendors are presented for recovery systems. Prototypes are currently being built and will be tested later in 2011. BACKGROUND Even though heavy (sinking) oils have historically accounted for a small percentage of spills, environmental and economic consequences resulting from a spill can be high. Heavy oils can sink and destroy shellfish and other marine life populations in addition to causing closure of water intakes at industrial facilities and power plants. The underwater environment poses major problems, including: poor visibility, difficulty in tracking oil <b>spill</b> movement, colder <b>temperatures,</b> inadequate containment methods and technologies, and problems with th...|$|R
40|$|Hydrocarbon spills have {{occurred}} on Antarctic soils where fuel oils are utilized, moved or stored. We investigated {{the effects of}} hydrocarbon <b>spills</b> on soil <b>temperature</b> and moisture regimes by comparing the properties of existing oil contaminated sites with those of nearby, uncontaminated, control sites at Scott Base, the old Marble Point camp, and Bull Pass in the Wright Valley. Hydrocarbon levels were elevated in fuel-contaminated samples. Climate stations were installed at all three locations in both contaminated and control sites. In summer at Scott Base and Marble Point the mean weekly maximum near surface (2 cm and 5 cm depth) soil temperatures were warmer (P< 0. 05), sometimes by more than 10 °C, at the contaminated site than the control sites. At Bull Pass there were {{no statistically significant differences}} in near-surface soil temperatures between contaminated and control soils. At the Scott Base and Marble Point sites soil albedo was lower, and hydrophobicity was higher, in the contaminated soils than the controls. The higher temperatures at the Scott Base and Marble Point hydrocarbon contaminated sites are attributed to the decreased surface albedo due to soil surface darkening by hydrocarbons. There were no noteworthy differences in moisture retention between contaminated and control sites...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there have}} only been {{a small number of}} {{submerged}} oil spills, 1 the environmental and economic consequences resulting from these types of spills can be large. The underwater environment poses major response challenges such as poor visibility, difficulty in tracking oil <b>spill</b> movement, colder <b>temperatures,</b> inadequate containment methods and technologies, and problems with equipment interaction with water. In the U. S. Coast Guard’s experience, the first oil spills that generated a large amount of sunken oil (oil that accumulates on the seafloor) were in 1993, when three vessels collided off of Tampa Bay, and a spill in Puerto Rico in 1994. More recently, spills occurred when a bulk carrier punctured a fuel tank in the Delaware River in 2004, and a barge capsized off of Texas in 2005. 2 The techniques used to find oil in these cases and similar ones included using divers, sonar, and water sampling. Each method had its challenges, such as the time involved and inconclusive results. For example, sonar could identify changes in mass density, but its readings were uncertain once the oil mixed with sediment. Sorbent material submerged oil recovery in the feld. U. S. Coast Guard photo. Oil recovery was fairly primitive — using weighted sorbent materials and dragging them along the sea floor. After the first two spills, the National Academy of Science recognized these issues and developed a report that provided a baseline for responders, and subsequently the Coast Guard’s Research and Development Center (RDC) launched a multi-year project to identify and develop techniques to better detect and recover sunken oil...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} cooling by liquified natural gas, literature on the topic wasinvestigated in prior project work. Test results for cooling of steel by liquid nitrogen wascompared to numerical solutions of heat transfer equations. A simple 1 D approach onheat gradients through a steel plate was developed for theoretical purposes, and over timeshow a comparable temperature profile with the test results. Test results comprised thecooling of a steel plate, from a trough placed over parts of the plate. Structural software USFOS, through the utility FAHTS, was used to model spill overa finite element (FE) model. Two models were utilized, a simplified deck plating modelgenerated specifically for this thesis, and a topside framework module - educational modelfrom NTNU. To describe the steel sections, we assessed steel in terms of performance whensubjected to cooling. Essential input to the analysis, in terms of properties for cryogenicfluid and steel, was identified prior to implementation in FAHTS and USFOS. Formulating the scope, the intent was to assess cryogenic spill simulations performed byComputIT, through the fire simulations software KFX. This being a new field of study,extending cryogenic spill with KFX as an extension to FAHTS proved to be too timeconsuming for the third party software provider. We chose to simplify our spill simulation,through FEM spill formulation for FAHTS, provided by USFOS AS. Applied <b>spill</b> routinestrictly assigns <b>temperature</b> to FE members, and does not offer a dynamic spill scenario. The spill routine, at beta stage for FAHTS, {{was applied to the}} best possible extent withinits limitations. Spill over different types of theoretical FEM elements had various compatibilitywith the spill routine, but the structural response in USFOS could be computed interms of desired temperature profiles from FAHTS. Restrictions were discovered duringthe analysis, and all results and interpretations adopted to these restrictions. Choice ofspill scenario was made from simple deductions on placement and function relative to anFLNG, and can be seen as specific to this thesis. Concluding on our results was done according to scope, with emphasis on steel performance. Important factors for the case of cryogenic temperatures was weighed in wheninterpreting the structural response. Embrittlement {{is the single most important}} factor in our analysis. Marine grade steelwill experience a ductile-to-brittle transition prior to cryogenic temperatures; performingslightly better than ordinary carbon steel. Disregarding any other factors, at the onset ofyielding, there will be abrupt fracture. On the contrary, cooled steel will have an increasein yield stress and tensile strength. Fracture will not occur from stresses imposed by cooling, but in connection with embrittlementand fatigue. Cracks at a critical crack length will not see any additional crackresistance, and there will be no crack arrest following added loading. Effects from contractingsteel, and the stress field arising to compensate for this behavior should be seenas the second most important consequence of cryogenic spillage. Being geometry specific,this does not exhibit any significant stress fields in this thesis. </p...|$|R
