40|$|The fungus Colletotrichum truncatum is a {{potential}} biocontrol agent (BA) against the noxious weed <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> (Metricaria perforata Mérat; syn. : Tripleurospermum perforatum (Mérat) Lainz) in western Canada. This potential BA, however, is taxonomically related to the anthracnose pathogen on lentil, raising questions about crop safety. Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) internal transcribed space (ITS) regions of C. truncatum isolates collected from different plant hosts were examined, and compared with additional Colletotrichum species. Sequences were amplified with the universal primers its 4 and its 5, and C. truncatum isolates from <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> and selected legume crops were differentiated consistently. All <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> isolates fell within a single cluster in phylogenetic trees, regardless of their geographic origins. These isolates were {{more closely related to}} lentil isolates of C. truncatum than to isolates from the other host species. Soybean isolates, with more falcate and slender conidia and slightly bigger appressoria, were distinguishable from other C. truncatum isolates, while the isolates from <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile,</b> lentil and pea were morphologically more similar. Based on sequence information, strain-specific PCR primers were designed for C. truncatum isolates from these hosts and used to amplify specific DNA bands (markers) from isolates of C. truncatum. This technique may be used for rapid detection and differentiation of C. truncatum, from <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> and designated legume species, as well as for tracking the BA after release. Inoculation trials were conducted using detached leaves and whole plants to determine potential cross infection of these C. truncatum isolates. Isolates from <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> caused disease only on their original host, but not on lentil, pea, soybean or alfalfa. In contrast, lentil isolates caused severe disease on lentil and pea, light symptoms on alfalfa, but no disease on the other hosts tested. Potential penetration of lentil leaves by <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> isolates was tested, with 2 - 23 % incidence of the fungus from inoculated detached, senescence leaves but disease symptoms were not observed on either detached leaves or whole plants. Examination of the infection process revealed that <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> and lentil isolates had a similar pattern of infection and disease development on their respective hosts; infection vesicles were produced 24 h after inoculation, both primary and secondary infection hyphae were present, and the onset of disease symptoms tended to coincide with the development of secondary hyphae. The current study provided molecular and pathological evidence that differentiates the potential BA of <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> from C. truncatum isolates from lentil, pea and soybean...|$|E
40|$|<b>Scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> Matricaria maritima (L.) ssp. inodora (L.) Dostal {{and common}} poppy Papaver rhoeas (L.) are species which very often infest winter cereal and winter rape crops. Inhibitors of acetolactate synthase (ALS) are {{commonly}} used for control of these weeds. The herbicides are characterised by a single site of action in the plant, which {{has an influence on}} selection of the weed population and may result in a rapid development of resistance. In 2012, five seed samples of <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> and five samples of common poppy were collected from five winter wheat crop fields in Żuławy Gdańskie where the weed species were very poorly controlled. Results of greenhouse experiments showed that two biotypes of <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> and common poppy were resistant to tribenuron methyl. It was not possible to control resistant biotypes even after use of tribenuron methyl at a dose four times higher than recommended in Poland, it is the first reported case of <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> and common poppy biotypes’ resistance to herbicides. It is not of economic importance but it does prove the growing problem of weed resistance in the country...|$|E
40|$|<b>Scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> is a noxious weed in the Canadian prairies and has natural {{tolerance}} to most post-emergent herbicides. A fungal pathogen, Colletotrichum truncatum, {{was identified as}} a potential biocontrol agent with moderate efficacy when broadcast at a spore concentration of 7 x 106 spores ml- 1 and a water volume of 200 L ha- 1. In this study, potential synergy of herbicides with the fungus was investigated by tank-mix applications in the greenhouse. Most of the herbicides tested at full label rates delayed fungal spore germination temporarily, but this inhibition was not observed after 24 hr incubation. On <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile,</b> the efficacy of the herbicide influenced the interaction between fungus and herbicide, with less effective products more likely exhibiting synergy although weed control might not be optimum. Clopyralid plus MCPA ester and metribuzin provided more effective <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> control when applied with the fungus and provided ideal tank mixes at the 8 -leaf and 11 -leaf stages, respectively. The addition of clodinafop to clopyralid plus MCPA ester plus the fungus did not further improve control of <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile,</b> but this tank-mix option may be practical for targeting a broad weed spectrum in cereals. Increasing fungal dose generally enhanced biocontrol efficacy, but this effect eased rapidly at higher doses. The addition of synergistic herbicides helped alleviate the high fungal dose required for weed control. There were no major differences in herbicide interaction among six fungal isolates tested, with metribuzin and clopyralid plus MCPA ester consistently exhibiting the highest weed control with all the isolates. Field trials with appropriate formulations are needed to validate the feasibility of this control strategy for <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> in the prairie climate...|$|E
40|$|In 1988, <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> (Matricaria perforata = Tripleurospermum perforatum) was {{proposed}} {{as a new}} target weed for biological control in Canada. <b>Scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> is mainly a weed of cultivated land, where it reduces crop yield. But it also forms dense, semi-permanent stands in periodically disturbed sites, such as slough margins, field depressions or roadsides, from which seeds spread into adjacent fields. Biological control is mainly aimed at these populations in uncultivated areas, because chemical and cultural control methods often prove uneconomic or impractical in these habitats, and because bio-logical control agents should {{be more likely to}} establish there. Surveys were started in Europe in 1990, and eight potential biocontrol agents have now been investigated. Three of these have been introduced into Canada, three were not specific enough for introduc-tion, and two are still under investigation. Because the plant reproduces only by seed, the first insect to be introduced and established was a seed-feeding weevil, Omphalapion (Apion) hookeri in 1992. This was followed by the stem-mining weevil Microplontus (Ceutorhynchus) edentulus in 1997. Studies on the population biology of <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> in Europe and Canada suggested that insects which attack the overwintering rosettes of <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> should be most effective. The gall midge Rhopalomyia n. sp., and the agromyzid Napomyza sp. near lateralis are therefore predicted to be the most successful agents. Both species are multivoltine and attack practically all plant phenos-tages throughout the growing season. Particularly the overwintering larvae in the rosettes may kill whole plants (Rhopalomyia) or developing shoots (Napomyza). Field release of Rhopalomyia was approved in March 1999, but the taxonomic position and host range of Napomyza still need to be clarified. Post-release studies are planned to test our predictions on relative agent effectiveness...|$|E
30|$|We used a {{completely}} randomized design with seven vegetation treatments, three soil types, two fertilizer treatments, and six replicates {{for a total}} of 252 pots in our greenhouse experiment. The three plant species used in this experiment were G. boreale (northern bedstraw, native forb), V. americana (American vetch, native forb), and M. perforata (<b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile,</b> non-native forb). The seven vegetation treatments were pure pots, i.e. monocultures of each plant species, mixed pots of each species pair (three species pair combinations), and control pots with no plants. Seedlings were planted at a density of four plants per pot in either pure or mixed (2 : 2) combinations.|$|E
40|$|The ceutorhynchine weevils Hadroplontus litura (F.) and Microplontus edentulus (Schultze) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), are {{established}} in North America as biological control agents for Canada thistle, Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop., and <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile,</b> Tripleurospermum perforatum (Mérat) M. Lainz (Asteraceae), respectively. In North America, both weeds occur sympatrically and in similar habitats as another ceutorhynchine, Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (Marsham) (cabbage seedpod weevil), an important pest of canola, Brassica napus L., and Brassica rapa L. (Brassicaceae). Ceutorhynchinae weevils released to control weeds in cultivated crops {{may serve as}} alternate hosts if agents released for biological control of C. obstrictus are not specific to that species. Parasitoids associated with M. edentulus and H. litura inflict similar levels of mortality on their hosts, yet a single species {{was associated with the}} latter host, whereas 13 species attacked the former. The stem-mining M. edentulus appears to be at some risk but not the root-crown feeding H. litura, should the parasitoids Trichomalus perfectus (Walker) and Mesopolobus morys (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) be introduced as biological control agents of the silique-feeding C. obstrictus. These findings suggest that feeding niche may be an important criterion for developing a nontarget species test list for host-range testing of potential biological control agent...|$|E
40|$|The {{biology and}} host {{range of the}} two root-mining weevils Diplapion confluensKirby and Coryssomerus capucinus (Beck), two {{potential}} agents for the biological control of <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> Tripleurospermum perforatum (Mérat) Laínz, were studied {{in the field in}} southern Germany and eastern Austria, and in a common garden and under laboratory conditions in Delémont, Switzerland from 1993 to 1999. Both weevils were univoltine, and females started to lay eggs in early spring. Diplapion confluens had three and C. capucinus five instars. Larvae of both species were found in the field from mid-April until the end of July; later instars preferentially fed in the vascular cylinder of the shoot base, root crown or root. Although larvae of both species occupy the same temporal and spatial niche within their host plants, they occurred at all investigated field sites together, and showed a similar distribution within sites. No negative or positive interspecific association was detected. Host-specificity tests including no-choice, single-choice, and multiple-choice tests under confined conditions, as well as tests under field conditions with natural and augmented insect densities revealed that both herbivores were specific to plant species in the tribe Anthemideae. However, their development to mature larva or adult on several cultivated plants, as well as on one plant species native to North America, rendered them unsuitable for field release in North America. It was concluded that to investigate non-target effects reliably, host-specificity tests with biological control agents should be carried out under a variety of conditions, particularly with augmented insect densities, as are expected to occur naturally after releas...|$|E
40|$|An isolate of Colletotrichum truncatum (Schwein.) Andrus & W. D. Moore is a {{promising}} bioherbicide candidate against <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> (Matricaria perforata Mérat), a noxious weed in western Canada. A major constraint {{in the development}} of this bioherbicide is the inefficiency of inoculum production. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore submerged fermentation for mass production of C. truncatum. A defined basal salts medium (DBSM) was used for liquid culture with glucose and casamino acids selected as the optimal carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sources, respectively. Spore yield and biomass production were significantly higher when the DBSM glucose concentration was 35 - 40 g/L compared to lower concentrations, while inoculum efficacy was significantly greater when produced at 5 - 10 g/L than at 40 g/L of glucose. Spore yield in baffled flasks at 200 RPM shaker speed was significantly higher than in regular flasks at lower shaker speeds. Under conditions of high aeration, glucose concentration had a significant effect on spore yield, biomass production, and efficacy, whereas the effect was not significant at low aeration. Specific spore and biomass yields also increased significantly with increasing glucose concentrations at high aeration. The scale of submerged fermentation was increased to 20 -L fermentors, with dO levels of 10 %, 30 %, and 60 % maintained by agitation and airflow controls. Further study will be required to optimize spore yields at the large scale. This study led to development of a protocol for production of C. truncatum spores using submerged fermentation. Inoculum produced with this method can be used for laboratory, greenhouse, and field trials in development of the bioherbicide...|$|E
40|$|The {{forage yield}} and quality, weed seedbank {{abundance}} and allelopathic potential of seven native grass and legume species were evaluated in field and greenhouse experiments {{conducted at the}} Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC), Swift Current Research and Development Centre (SCRDC), Saskatchewan, Canada. Native perennial forage species were selected from three functional groups (C 3, C 4 grasses and legumes) and seeded in 2010 and 2014 in monocultures and mixtures, including: western wheatgrass (WWG) (Pascopyrum smithii (Rydb.) Barkworth & D. R. Dewey), bluebunch wheatgrass (BBW) (Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) Á. Löve), nodding brome (NOB) (Bromus porteri (J. M. Coult.) Nash), little blue stem (LBS) (Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash), side-oats grama (SOG) (Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Torr.), purple prairie clover (PPC) (Dalea purpurea Vent.) and white prairie clover (WPC) (Dalea candida Willd.). Objectives of this thesis were to: 1) evaluate the long-term forage yield and quality of these forage species in monocultures and mixtures; 2) determine the weed seedbank density and aboveground weed populations in stands of these species; and 3) evaluate the allelopathic effect of these species on three problematic weeds: dandelion (Taraxacum officinale F. H. Wigg.), <b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> (Matricaria perforata Mérat) and foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum L.). Forage mixtures produced greater dry matter than monocultures at all harvesting times. Mixtures of which WWG was a component produced higher forage yield, and a mixture of WWG, BBW, LBS and legumes can provide sustainable forage yield and quality and can be suitable options for seeded pastures. In this study, the forage stands experienced one of the driest and wettest years {{in the history of}} the region. We observed no significant differences in forage production of each species from dry to wet year supporting the idea of high stability and productivity of native species during varying climate conditions. Mixtures of forage species also promoted lower weed densities in the seedbank and in the swards aboveground compared to monocultures. Among mixtures, those containing WWG had a significant lower abundance of weeds in the seedbank and aboveground weed populations compared to other forage species. The weed seedbank varied seasonally with the minimum number of weed seeds in early spring and maximum in late summer. The most abundant weeds in the seedbank were the least abundant weeds in aboveground population and vice versa. WWG showed promising results as a native forage species by demonstrating the potential to suppress weeds and reduce weed seed size when seeded in monocultures and mixtures. In the greenhouse, root leachate from WWG, LBS and SOG reduced the aboveground and belowground growth of weeds up to 90 %. These findings suggest that the use of allelopathic species may provide weed control and management benefits in seeded pastures and native prairie restorations. In conclusion, forage mixtures produced greater dry matter and promoted lower weed densities in the seedbank and aboveground populations compared to monocultures. This demonstrates that increasing forage mixture diversity can increase forage yield and be an effective ecological and non-chemical weed control tactic in seeded pastures...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the distribution of exotic plants and determine the potential threats in the mixedwood section of the boreal forest. The invasion of exotic plants into natural areas is a growing concern among ecologists. Exotic species have no previous exposure to the invaded area and have been introduced, either intentionally or accidentally, by humans. These plants have the potential to suppress surrounding vegetation and acquire the majority of available resources. This dominance alters important ecosystem functions and negatively affects ecosystem structure and composition. This study examined three types of land use (roadside right-of-way maintenance, timber harvesting and wildfire) to identify the density, frequency and cover of exotic plants within the mixedwood forest. There were also separate categories of the time since disturbance (re-current, recent and mature) for each disturbance type. Data were collected in the summer field seasons of 2000 and 2001 in and nearby the Prince Albert Model Forest (approximately 70 km north of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan). Surveying was completed in mature forest, harvested and wildfire areas using 10 x 10 m quadrats. These quadrats were adjacent to or remote from roadside right-of-ways that were deliberately seeded with exotic species. Seeding the right-of-ways with exotic species occurred along principal and secondary highways. Surveying was also conducted within roadside right-of-ways using 1 x 1 m quadrats. These quadrats were adjacent to the recently disturbed and mature quadrats surveyed in the previous year. Each plant species observed in the quadrats had a cover value assigned, while stem counts were also conducted for exotic species. A total of 23 exotic species were observed within the quadrats. The exotic herb species belong to the Gramineae (9 species), Leguminosae (7), Compositae (5) families with one species each in Plantaginaceae and Boraginaceae. No exotic trees or shrubs were observed within the study sites. Areas that were recently disturbed either by timber harvesting or wildfire had 6 different exotic species with an average density of 0. 2 ± 0. 1 stems/m 2 and a frequency of 72 %. Similar exotic frequencies and species in both recently harvested and burned survey sites suggests that these disturbances have a comparable affect on exotic distributions. Exotic species capable of wind dispersal had the highest frequencies in the recently disturbed survey sites. Common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) had a frequency of 57 %, perennial sow thistle (Sonchus arvensis) was observed in 38 % of the sites and annual hawksbeard (Crepis tectorum) was at 25 %. Mature forest had a lower population of exotic plants, with only 2 exotic species observed. Taraxacum officinale and Canada bluegrass (Poa compressa) were observed in 13 % of the mature quadrats with an average density of 0. 002 ± 0. 002 stems/m 2. The right-of-way quadrats contained the highest amount of exotics with 22 observed species. The average density of exotic species in roadside right-of-ways was 117 ± 22 stems/m 2 with 94 % of the quadrats containing at least one exotic plant. The deliberate introduction, frequency of disturbance and the physical environment of roadside right-of-ways appear to influence the distribution of exotic plant species. The most frequently observed exotic species in the right-of-way areas were Taraxacum officinale (observed in 73 % of the quadrats at 8 stems/m 2) followed by alsike clover (Trifolium hybridum at 45 % and 17 stems/m 2), Sonchus arvensis (43 % and 4 stems/m 2), creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra at 36 % and 31 stems/m 2) and smooth brome grass (Bromus inermis at 31 % and 17 stems/m 2). These species are either common in urban areas, agricultural weeds or have been deliberately seeded into right-of-way areas. The distribution of exotic species suggests that land use contributes to increased densities and frequencies of exotic plants. Each exotic species observed was ranked according to a system developed by Hiebert and Stubbendieck (1993). The ranking system was used to determine the current and potential threat of exotic plant species to become detrimental to ecosystem structure, composition and function. The ranking identified 14 species that were a lesser threat and easy to control, 8 species that were a lesser threat and hard to control, and one species, Bromus inermis, that was ranked as a serious threat and hard to control. Additional monitoring is required as the species observed in this study may be exhibiting a “lag phase” of population expansion, which typically precedes an exponential increase. Other species (<b>scentless</b> <b>chamomile</b> (Matricaria perforata) and caragana (Caragana arborescens)) that were not observed in the study area, but are known to occur within the region, are also a concern with respect to future exotic species invasions. Anticipated climatic changes are also expected to increase the distribution of exotic species as changes to environmental attributes will produce a longer growing season and increased plant growth and productivity...|$|E
