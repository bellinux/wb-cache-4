60|$|Lord Rotherwood {{came in to}} try to wile {{his cousin}} {{to share in the}} survey of the country; but she {{declared}} it to be impossible, as all her avocations had fallen into arrear, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a couple of servants as well as a house for the Merrifields.

60|$|She {{raised her}} head to {{consider}} a noise overhead--the faint, domestic thunder of a sewing-machine shaking the walls with its rhythm. The machine stopped. She heard the noise of scissors dropped on the floor--the most stuffily domestic sound in the world. The airless house was crushing her. She sprang up--and then she sat down again. There {{was no place to}} which she could flee. Henry Carson and the district school were menacing her.

60|$|Two blocks {{across from}} her, {{seen through the}} rising walls of the new apartment-houses, were the drab windows {{of a group of}} {{run-down}} tenements, which broke the sleek respectability of the well-to-do quarter. In those windows Ruth observed foreign-looking, idle women, not very clean, who had nothing to do after they had completed half an hour of slovenly housework in the morning. They watched their neighbors breathlessly. They peered out with the petty virulent curiosity of the workless at whatever passed in the streets below them. Fifty times a day they could be seen to lean far out on their fire-escapes and follow with slowly craning necks and unblinking eyes the passing of something--ice-wagons, undertakers' wagons, ole-clo' men, Ruth surmised. The rest of the time, ragged-haired and greasy of wrapper, gum-chewing and yawning, they rested their unlovely stomachs on discolored sofa-cushions on the window-sills and waited for something to appear. Two blocks away they were--yet to Ruth they seemed to be in the room with her, claiming her as one of their sisterhood. For now she was a useless woman, as they were. She raged with the thought that she might grow to be like them in every respect--she, Ruth Winslow!... She wondered if any of them were Norwegians named Ericson.... With the fascination of dread she watched them as closely as they watched the world with the hypnotization of unspeakable hopelessness.... <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> her work, something for which the world needed her, lest she be left here, useless and unhappy in a flat. In her kitchen she was merely an intruder on the efficient maid, and there was no nursery.|$|E
