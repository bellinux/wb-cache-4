With the development of advanced wireless radio technology, especially Discontiguous Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (DOFDM), discontiguous <b>spectrum</b> access and <b>spectrum</b> aggregation in a single radio has become possible. With the help of discontiguous <b>spectrum</b> access, the small <b>spectrum</b> fragments could be aggregated and further utilized, which can dramatically improve the <b>spectrum</b> utilization efficiency. Based on this observation, we propose Aggregation-Aware <b>Spectrum</b> Assignment (AASA), a <b>spectrum</b> assignment algorithm in cognitive ad-hoc networks.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{wireless}} services and the breakneck proliferation of wireless devices continue to strain limited <b>spectrum</b> resource. While the need for efficient <b>spectrum</b> sharing mechanisms has been emphasized, opportunistic <b>spectrum</b> access has been considered as a promising mechanism for dynamic <b>spectrum</b> sharing. However, although the idle <b>spectrum</b> could exist, it is usually rather fragmented and distributed, and hence the secondary network users would face the difficulty in finding required contiguous <b>spectrum.</b> <b>Spectrum</b> aggregation can be exploited to provide effective wide bandwidth communication but {{at the cost of}} complexity and overhead. When a primary network uses <b>spectrum</b> dynamically, from the nature of opportunistic <b>spectrum</b> access, collisions can occur between primary and secondary transmissions and <b>spectrum</b> handoff can be utilised to provide reliable communication. However, collision occurrence results in <b>spectrum</b> handoff delay in a secondary network user (SU) along with short-term interference to a primary network user (PU). As a SU accesses more <b>spectrum</b> for higher data rates by <b>spectrum</b> aggregation, collisions can occur more frequently and frequent <b>spectrum</b> handoff will be required. While <b>spectrum</b> aggregation will allow the SU to have high flexibility in <b>spectrum</b> use and <b>spectrum</b> handoff can help improve the reliability of secondary transmissions, the SU faces a new <b>spectrum</b> allocation problem: How wide and which parts of <b>spectrum</b> opportunities should be aggregated while considering the complexity and the overhead for aggregation and for <b>spectrum</b> handoff? This thesis addresses the key challenge of opportunistic <b>spectrum</b> access, focusing on efficient <b>spectrum</b> sharing considering the fragmentation of <b>spectrum</b> opportunities in frequency and time domains. First, considering complexity and overhead for aggregation, the <b>spectrum</b> aggregation approach is investigated and guidelines are derived how to reduce <b>spectrum</b> fragmentation for the efficient <b>spectrum</b> utilisation based on simulation results. Second, the relationship between collision occurrence and <b>spectrum</b> aggregation is analysed. Collision probabilities between primary and secondary transmissions are derived and the impacts of <b>spectrum</b> aggregation on data rates and <b>spectrum</b> handoff are investigated. Then, a <b>spectrum</b> aggregation algorithm is proposed to maximise data rates for a given collision probability threshold. Third, when considering <b>spectrum</b> handoff, the impacts of <b>spectrum</b> aggregation on <b>spectrum</b> handoff and short-term interference to PUs are analysed. Then, the <b>spectrum</b> aggregation algorithm is designed with the aim to minimise collision.
