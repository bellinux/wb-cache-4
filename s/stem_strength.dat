Weakness in the stem and poor root anchorage, when subjected to external factors such as wind, rain or disease, result in stem/root lodging or the permanent failure of the plant shoot to support its upright position [2]. <b>Stem</b> <b>strength</b> is a complex trait reflecting cellulose content, the length, the organ, the orientation of cellulose microfibrils and the degree of lignification [3 - 5]. These traits contribute synergistically to plant <b>stem</b> <b>strength.</b> Previous studies have shown that a decrease in load-bearing cell wall polymers such as cellulose or lignin can negatively affect <b>stem</b> <b>strength</b> in barley [6], wheat [7], rice [8] and maize [9].

Genetic variation {{was significant for}} all the lodging-related traits in the cross-year analysis, however, significant G × E interaction due to rank changes or changes in the absolute differences between cultivars were identified. The inconsistences on cultivar performances across seasons particularly reduced the heritability of key characters related to root lodging resistance (anchorage strength). Target characters related to stem lodging resistance (<b>stem</b> <b>strength)</b> showed good heritability values equal or above 0. 70. Positive correlations between <b>stem</b> <b>strength</b> and stem diameter and between root plate spread and root strength were found. Selecting for greater stem diameter and wall width, greater root plate spread and shorter plant height could enable breeders to increase lodging resistance by increasing <b>stem</b> <b>strength,</b> root strength and decreasing plant leverage, respectively. Achieving a lodging-proof crop will depend on finding a wider root plate spread and implementing new management strategies. Genetic linkages between lodging traits will not constrain {{the combination of the}} key lodging-trait dimensions to achieve a lodging-proof ideotype.

30|$|According to a {{previous}} study by Sterling et al. (2003), the lodging of cereal plants can be classified into two types.

Although attempts to over-express the SCW HvCesA genes also resulted in silencing of the transgenes and endogenous SCW HvCesA genes, aberrant phenotypes were sometimes observed.

40|$|The {{majority}} {{of efforts to}} increase specificity or sensitivity in biosensors result in trade-offs with little to no gain in overall accuracy. This is because a biosensor cannot be more accurate than the affinity interaction it is based on. Accordingly, we have developed {{a new class of}} reagents based on mathematical principles of cooperativity to enhance the accuracy of the affinity interaction. Tentacle probes (TPs) have a hairpin structure similar to molecular beacons (MBs) for enhanced specificity, but are modified by the addition of a capture probe for increased kinetics and affinity.

40|$|Xylan is {{the second}} most {{abundant}} polysaccharide on Earth, and represents a major component of both dicot wood and the cell walls of grasses. Much knowledge has been gained from studies of xylan biosynthesis in the model plant, Arabidopsis. In particular, the irregular xylem (irx) mutants, named for their collapsed xylem cells, have been essential in gaining a greater understanding of the genes involved in xylan biosynthesis. In contrast, xylan biosynthesis in grass cell walls is poorly understood. We identified three rice genes Os 07 g 49370 (OsIRX 9), Os 01 g 48440 (OsIRX 9 L), and Os 06 g 47340 (OsIRX 14), from glycosyltransferase family 43 as putative orthologs to the putative β- 1, 4 -xylan backbone elongating Arabidopsis IRX 9, IRX 9 L, and IRX 14 genes, respectively. We demonstrate that the overexpression of the closely related rice genes, in full or partly complement the two well-characterized Arabidopsis irregular xylem (irx) mutants: irx 9 and irx 14. Complementation was assessed by measuring dwarfed phenotypes, irregular xylem cells in stem cross sections, xylose content of stems, xylosyltransferase activity of stems, and <b>stem</b> <b>strength.</b> The expression of OsIRX 9 in the irx 9 mutant resulted in xylosyltransferase activity of stems that was over double that of wild type plants, and the <b>stem</b> <b>strength</b> of this line increased to 124 % above that of wild type. Taken together, our results suggest that OsIRX 9 /OsIRX 9 L, and OsIRX 14, have similar functions to the Arabidopsis IRX 9 and IRX 14 genes, respectively. Furthermore, our expression data indicate that OsIRX 9 and OsIRX 9 L may function in building the xylan backbone in the secondary and primary cell walls, respectively.

40|$|Genetic {{manipulation}} of cellulose synthase genes (CesA) {{might be expected}} to increase cellulose content and improve the <b>stem</b> <b>strength</b> of cereals. Such a possibility would have beneficial applications in stem lodging and producing crops with higher cellulose content for biofuel feedstocks. Thus, an attempt to manipulate cellulose content was made via three approaches: (1) Driving barley HvCesA genes using the CaMV 35 S constitutive promoter. (2) Driving barley secondary cell wall (SCW) HvCesA genes with specific promoters from barley and maize, and (3) Identifying novel transcription factors interacting with CesA promoters and over-expressing those candidate transcription factors in transgenic Arabidopsis lines. In Chapter 2, attempts to drive HvCesA genes involved in both primary and secondary cell wall biosynthesis via the CaMV 35 S promoter are described. Five sets of barley plants transformed with primary cell wall (PCW) and SCW HvCesA genes were analysed for transcript levels, phenotype, tissue morphology, cellulose content and crystalline cellulose distribution in cell walls. Only the lines transgenic for the SCW HvCesA genes exhibited aberrant phenotypes. One of the two constructs showed a dwarfed phenotype, where xylem cells in the vascular tissue were irregular in shape and partially collapsed. Transcript silencing, together with cellulose content reduction, were also observed in the dwarf plants and TEM images showed a significant decrease in cell wall thickness. Overall, there was no increase in either crystalline cellulose content or in <b>stem</b> <b>strength.</b> In Chapter 3, experiments are described that further investigated if specific barley or maize promoters could ameliorate the aberrant phenotypes reported in Chapter 2. Promoter/gene combination constructs made up of either a barley HvCesA 4 or maize ZmCesA 10 (orthologue) promoters fused with either the HvCesA 4 or HvCesA 8 gene were used for transformation. Phenotyping, transcript profiling, <b>stem</b> <b>strength</b> measurements and cellulose content determination were conducted. There was no reduction in stature for any To transgenic plants, although other aberrant phenotypes were observed. One out of four promoter/gene combinations, namely HvCesA 4 pro:HvCesA 4, produced an increase in crystalline cellulose content and <b>stem</b> <b>strength.</b> In situ PCR results showed that the HvCesA 4 transgene transcripts in this line were concentrated in the vascular bundles of the stem. Finally, an attempt to manipulate cellulose content was conducted by over-expressing candidate transcription factors shown to interact with the CesA 4 promoter, as described in Chapter 4. Candidate transcription factors in apple (Malus x domestica) were identified using the dual luciferase transient expression system in tobacco, with Arabidopsis and barley CesA promoters as bait. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines transformed with two candidate MYB transcription factors were analysed for phenotype, transcript abundance and cellulose content. Over-expression of these transcription factors did not increase crystalline cellulose content in Arabidopsis, despite an induction of SCW AtCesA transcript levels. In conclusion, the results presented demonstrate the importance of controlled expression of HvCesA genes to increase cellulose content and <b>stem</b> <b>strength</b> as well as the existence of a finely balanced regulatory system that controls the cellulose biosynthetic process.

30|$|The {{higher the}} lodging index, the more {{susceptible}} the lodging response to N was. For the Wuyunjing 23 cultivar, {{the response of}} the lodging rate in the field and the lodging index to top-dressing N tended to level off. With increasing top-dressing N application rates, the gravity centre height increased slightly but not significantly; however, the plant height increased higher (Table  1). Thus, to a certain extent, the lodging index of rice plants increased (Li et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015). Additionally, compared with LN treatments, the lignified cell walls in the mechanical tissue and vascular bundle sheath regions, which were closely related with stem stiffness, differed little (Figs. 3 and 5). However, the thickness of the mechanical tissue, the ALVB and the ASVB decreased significantly under HN conditions (Fig. 4, Table 2), resulting in a reduction in <b>stem</b> <b>strength.</b> These results were consistent with previous reports by Zhang et al. (2009).

30|$|An {{improvement}} in the lodging resistance of japonica rice plants could be achieved by reducing {{the length of the}} lower internodes, decreasing the inner culm diameter and developing a thicker mechanical tissue. Top-dressing N application increased the plant height and inner culm diameter and decreased the ALVB and the ASVB of the Wuyunjing 23 cultivar and caused deficient lignified sclerenchyma cells, lowered the ALVB and the ASVB, and increased the AAC of the W 3668 cultivar resulting in weaker <b>stem</b> <b>strength</b> and a higher lodging index.|$|E

The TaCM protein levels were analysed by protein gel blot and COMT enzyme activity was determined during the same stem developmental stages. TaCM mRNA levels were higher in H 4546 from elongation to the milky stages and in C 6001 the TaCM mRNA levels decreased markedly at the heading and milky stages. The TaCM protein levels and COMT activity were also higher in H 4564 than that in C 6001 at the heading and milky stages. These results corresponded to a higher lignin content measured by the Klason method and <b>stem</b> <b>strength</b> and a lower lodging index in H 4564 than in C 6001 at the heading and milky stages. Therefore, the TaCM mRNA levels, protein levels, and enzyme activity in developing wheat stems were associated with <b>stem</b> <b>strength</b> and lodging index in these two wheat cultivars.

40|$|Various flood {{protection}} measures are studied across the globe, and nature-friendly and environmentally resilient methods are gaining more attention. As {{part of the}} building with nature initiative, the project BE SAFE (Bio-Engineering for SAFEty) studies the effects of a vegetated foreshore as a {{flood protection}} measure which is found to be very effective. Vegetation helps to reduce wave energy as the stems and canopy work as small hurdles and obstacles that the waves need to pass. In this process, the waves lose much of its energy and the wave height reduces. As a result, the wave height is lower at the shore and less force acts on the coastal dike. From previous research, vegetation is known to be a dominant measure of wave energy dissipation, but the detailed processes of how it interacts with waves is not well known. Until now, vegetation in the foreshore has either been completely ignored (by coastal dike managers) or considered healthy and abundant (by ecologists). This research acknowledges that vegetation exists, but its strength and stem density may vary depending on the location and time of the year. The focus of this research is understanding the interaction between vegetation and waves, as well as its implications to the probability of dike overtopping and flooding. As waves pass through vegetation, stems break from the wave forcing which results in a variation of stem density in time (season) and space (foreshore). In this research, the mechanical interaction between vegetation stems and wave force is assessed to understand the point of stem breakage. Further, the vegetation stem breakage is implemented into the wave energy balance and in the probabilistic model of V. Vuik to quantify the probability of overtopping and dike failure. <b>Stem</b> <b>strength</b> is quantified by the three-point bending test results from NIOZ (Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research), which is used to calculate the maximum allowable stress of the stem. This <b>stem</b> <b>strength</b> is compared to the wave-induced stress which is formulated by taking the Morison-type equation to quantify a uniform wave load acting over the submerged length of the stem. In this mechanical analysis, stems are assumed to break when the wave load exceeds <b>stem</b> <b>strength.</b> Stem breakage is then implemented into the wave energy balance formulas, through which the stem density variation affects the amount of wave energy dissipation by influencing the wave height transformation. A correction factor is introduced to take into account leaning stems, but the correction factor could also include other simplifications that are not accounted for. Further, the performance of the wave energy balance is assessed through a sensitivity analysis of incoming wave height and seasonal vegetation data. Seasonal vegetation data and stem breakage is implemented to the probabilistic model of V. Vuik which quantifies the probability of flooding (due to overtopping). Vegetation and correlation scenarios are tested to find the optimum approach and address the uncertainty in the result. Of the different vegetation scenarios, the most realistic approach is the percent stem breakage which evaluates wave load to the normal cumulative distribution function of <b>stem</b> <b>strength.</b> Further, the uncertainty of model results is reduced by using the correlation scenario with characteristic relations between vegetation parameters. Including vegetation stem breakage in the probabilistic model produces reasonable results, yet further research to calibrate the correction factor and to better define characteristic relations would strengthen the model result.

40|$|Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) is {{responsible}} for the CoA ester to aldehyde conversion in monolignol biosynthesis, which diverts phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites into the biosynthesis of lignin. To {{gain a better understanding of}} lignin biosynthesis and its biological function, a cDNA encoding CCR was identified from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and designated as Ta-CCR 1. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Ta-CCR 1 grouped together with other monocot CCR sequences while it diverged from Ta-CCR 2. DNA gelblot and mapping analyses demonstrated that Ta-CCR 1 is present as a single copy gene in the wheat genome. Recombinant Ta-CCR 1 protein converted feruloyl CoA, 5 -OH-feruloyl CoA, sinapoyl CoA, and caffeoyl CoA, but feruloyl-CoA was the best substrate, suggesting the preferential biosynthesis of G-type lignin. RNA gel-blot analysis indicated that Ta-CCR 1 was highly expressed in stem, with lower expression in leaves, and undetectable expression in roots. CCR enzyme activity was increased progressively along with the lignin biosynthesis and stem maturity. During stem development, Ta-CCR 1 mRNA levels remained high at elongation, heading, and milky stages in the wheat H 4564 cultivar, while they declined dramatically at the heading and milky stages in stems of the C 6001 cultivar. Ta-CCR 1 mRNA expression paralleled extractable CCR enzyme activity in these two cultivars. Furthermore, high Ta-CCR 1 mRNA levels and high CCR enzyme activity in wheat stem were correlated with a higher Klason lignin content and greater stem mechanical strength in the H 4564 cultivar.

40|$|QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI ASSOCIATED WITH LODGING, <b>STEM</b> <b>STRENGTH,</b> YIELD, AND OTHER IMPORTANT AGRONOMIC TRAITS IN DRY FIELD PEAS By Jamin Smitchger and Norman Weeden In pea, lodging changes canopy structure, {{increases}} disease pressure, reduces yield, {{and reduces}} harvest efficiency. In order {{to discover the}} quantitative trait loci (QTLs) influencing lodging resistance and other important agronomic traits in pea, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was created from a relatively wide cross between the commercial variety Delta and an unnamed pea variety. The RIL population was grown for 6 site-years in Bozeman and Moccasin, MT, USA, and phenotypic data was collected for 22 quantitative morphological traits and seven categorical traits which {{were thought to be}} associated with lodging resistance. Genotypic data was derived from genotype by sequencing, microsattelite markers, and cleaved amplified sequence tagged sites. QTL analysis identified a total of 135 putative QTLs for the 22 traits examined in the study. There were 12 specific regions where 115 QTLs co-located, indicating that as few as 12 genes may be responsible for multiple pleiotropic effects. Ten QTLs were found for lodging resistance. Due to the large amount of phenotypic data collected, the putative mechanism of lodging resistance was determined for each QTL. In nearly every case, lodging resistance was associated with reduced plant height, a change in tendril number, or increased <b>stem</b> <b>strength.</b> This conclusion was supported by mathematical modeling. Branch number, which determines the number of tendrils per plant, was also positively associated with lodging resistance during all site-years, indicating that increasing tendril number also increases lodging resistance. Yield was controlled by eight QTLs. All QTLs for yield had pleiotropic effects on lodging resistance and yield per plant. Seed size was not correlated with yield, and a model was created which explained why no association between yield and seed size was found...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLodging is an {{important}} factor limiting rice yield and quality by bending or breaking stem in japonica rice (Oryza sativa L.) production. The objectives of this study were to determine the mechanism of lodging resistance in japonica rice as affected by carbohydrate components, especially its related arrangement in culm tissue and response to top-dressing nitrogen (N) fertilizer. Field experiments were conducted in Danyang County, Jiangsu Province, China, by using two japonica rice varieties Wuyunjing 23 (lodging-resistance variety) and W 3668 (lodging-susceptible variety) with three top-dressing N fertilizer rates (0, 135 and 270 kg N ha− 1) in 2013 and 2014. Lodging related physical parameters, morphological characteristics and stem carbohydrate components were investigated at 30 d after full heading stage. Results showed that with increasing N fertilizer rates, the lodging rate and lodging index increased rapidly primarily due to significant reduction of breaking strength in two japonica rice varieties. Correlation analysis revealed that breaking strength was significantly and positively correlated with bending stress, but negatively correlated with section modulus, except for significant correlation at W 3668 in 2014. Higher stem plumpness status and structural carbohydrate contents significantly enhanced stem stiffness, despite of lower non-structural carbohydrate. With higher N fertilizer rate, the culm wall thickness was almost identical, and culm diameter increased slightly. The structural carbohydrates, especially for lignin content in culm, reduced significantly under high N rate. Further histochemical staining analysis revealed that high N treatments decreased the lignin deposition rapidly in the sclerenchyma cells of mechanical tissue, large vascular bundle and small vascular bundle region, which were consistent with reduction of bending stress, especially for W 3668 and thus, resulted in poor <b>stem</b> <b>strength</b> and higher lodging index. These results suggested that structural carbohydrate plays a vital role for improving <b>stem</b> <b>strength</b> in japonica rice. N rate decreased lodging resistance primarily due to poor stem stiffness, by reducing structural carbohydrate content and lignin deposition in the secondary cell wall of lower internode culm tissue...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "stump fairy helmet" [...] Mycena alcalina is {{a common}} species that is similar in {{appearance}} and odor to M.leptocephala. However, it grows on conifer wood and rarely on the ground. Microscopically, it has numerous cystidia on the gill edges. Although M.leptocephala usually has a weaker alkaline odor and a more fragile <b>stem,</b> the <b>strength</b> of the odor of M.alcalina is also quite variable, so differences in odor cannot {{be used as the}} sole distinguishing characteristic. M.austera, described from southern Norway in 1994, differs from M.leptocephala by the lack of a nitrous odor, and differently shaped cheilocystidia and terminal cells of the cortical layer of the stem. Alexander H. Smith considers M.brevipes close to M.leptocephala, but the former mushroom has a short stem up to [...] long, typically grows singly, and lacks an odor.|$|R

The ability of our native chaparral to withstand environmental factors, {{such as the}} Santa Ana winds, and overall health {{is directly related to}} plant strength. Seeking to answer these questions, we hypothesized that a difference in water potential between thinned and non-thinned chaparral affects the <b>stem</b> mechanical <b>strength</b> of the plants.
