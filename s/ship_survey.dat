50|$|On 27 March 1981, Bulwark {{returned}} to Portsmouth {{for the final}} time in her career.

40|$|We {{examined}} the summer distribution of marine mammals off the northern Washington coast based on six ship transect surveys conducted between 1995 and 2002, {{primarily from the}} NOAA ship McArthur. Additionally, small boat surveys were conducted in the same region between 1989 and 2002 to gather photographic identification data on humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and killer whales (Orcinus orca) to examine movements and population structure. In the six years of <b>ship</b> <b>survey</b> effort, 706 sightings of 15 marine mammal species were made. Humpback whales were the most common large cetacean species and were seen every year {{and a total of}} 232 sightings of 402 animals were recorded during ship surveys. Highest numbers were observed in 2002, when there were 79 sightings of 139 whales. Line-transect estimates for humpback whales indicated that about 100 humpback whales inhabited these waters each year between 1995 and 2000; in 2002, however, the estimate was 562 (CV= 0. 21) whales. A total of 191 unique individuals were identified photographically and mark recapture estimates also indicated that the number of animals increased from under 100 to over 200 from 1995 to 2002. There was only limited interchange of humpback whales between this area and feeding areas off Oregon and California. Killer whales were also seen on every <b>ship</b> <b>survey</b> and represented all known ecotypes of the Pacific Northwest, including southern and northern residents, transients, and offshore-type killer whales. Dall’s porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) were the most frequently sighted small cetacean; abundance was estimated at 181 − 291 individuals, except for 2002 when we observed dramatically higher numbers (876, CV= 0. 30). Northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) were the most common pinnipeds observed. There were clear habitat differences related to distance offshore and water depth for different species...|$|E
40|$|North Atlantic Sightings Surveys for {{cetaceans}} {{were carried}} out Northeast and Central Atlantic in 1987, 1989, 1995 and 2001. Here we provide estimates of density and abundance for minke whales from the Faroese and Icelandic ship surveys. The estimates are not corrected for availability or perception biases. Double platform data collected in 2001 indicates that perception bias is likely considerable for this species. However comparison of corrected estimates of density from aerial surveys with a <b>ship</b> <b>survey</b> estimate from the same area suggests that ship surveys can be nearly unbiased under optimal survey conditions with high searching effort. There were some regional changes in density over the period but no overall changes in density and abundance. Given the recent catch history for minke whales in this area, we would not expect to see changes in abundance due to exploitation that would be detectable with these surveys. </div...|$|E

40|$|The {{major goal}} {{of this study was}} to find match-ups between thermal fronts mapped from {{satellite}} sea surface temperature (SST) imagery and from in situ data in the southern South China Sea (SSCS), using 11 <b>ship</b> <b>surveys</b> conducted by the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology (SCSIO) between 1987 and 1999. Fronts were automatically detected by the Cayula-Cornillon multi-image edge detection algorithm (CCA) applied to satellite-derived maps of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) SST obtained from the Pathfinder project (8364 twice-daily global fields with 9 km resolution between 1985 and 1996). Twice-daily near-instant frontal maps were composited without any averaging or smoothing to produce individual monthly frontal maps covering the period from January 1985 through December 1996 (144 maps in total). Although the SSCS is a tropical sea with little SST difference between water masses, the CCA turned out to be an effective tool for front mapping in the SSCS. Out of the 11 <b>ship</b> <b>surveys</b> analysed in this study, four surveys produced satisfactory match-ups. The percentage of match-ups is considered reasonably high given that (1) <b>ship</b> <b>surveys</b> were not optimized to cross fronts, therefore most in situ sections missed fronts; (2) satellite measurements of SST with AVHRR are hampered by cloudiness, therefore satellite-derived frontal maps might miss some fronts masked by persistent cloudiness. Fronts are more distinct in winter, when cross-frontal SST gradients are enhanced. From oceanographic vertical sections and horizontal maps, fronts are much sharper in the subsurface layer (represented here by 50 m level). Nonetheless, the CCA successfully detected SST fronts with a cross-frontal step as small as 1 degrees C...|$|R

40|$|The {{abundance}} {{of the only}} population of vaquitas, Gulf of California harbor porpoise (Phocoena sinus), is estimated from four surveys conducted in Mexico between 1986 and 1993, {{using a variety of}} methods. A line-transect approach was applied, using some parameters estimated from a related species, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Vaquita abundance is estimated as 503 (CV = 0. 63) from 1986 - 1988 boat surveys, 885 (CV = 0. 50) from 1988 [...] 1989 aerial surveys, 572 (CV = 1. 43) from a 1991 aerial survey, and 224 (CV = 0. 39) from a 1993 <b>ship</b> <b>survey.</b> A weighted log-linear regression in dicates a rate of population change (decline) of - 17. 7 % per year (95 % CI = - 43. 2 % to + 19. 3 %) between 1986 and 1993.

The reason for using multi-pixel areas was for avoiding cloud contaminated pixels {{in the vicinity of}} the field measurements. Care must be taken when applying the warmest pixel technique near oceanic fronts. The Gulf of Mexico results clearly indicate a persistent degradation in algorithm accuracy due to El Chichon aerosols.
