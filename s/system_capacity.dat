25|$|With the {{construction}} of the Central Subway and ongoing <b>system</b> <b>capacity</b> increase, there are plans to add 24 more cars with Siemens, Kawasaki, and CAF having been prequalified to bid; Breda was disqualified based on a ranking of potential bidders. The contract was awarded to Siemens for the purchase of a total of 260 cars, and Muni is expected to choose from three initial designs in the new S200 class. The 260 cars would be delivered in three phases: the initial batch of 24 would be used on the new Central Subway, the next batch of 151 would replace the existing fleet starting in 2021 as they reached their 25-year life expectancy, and another 85 would be added, funding permitting, to accommodate projected ridership growth through 2040. Muni partially exercised their option and added 40 cars from the third phase by 2015.|$|E
25|$|In late 2015 Calgary Transit began {{operating}} four-car LRT trains on the CTrain system. The lengthening of trains {{was done}} to alleviate overcrowding as the system was already carrying more than 300,000 passengers per day, and many trains were overcrowded. The lengthening of trains increased the maximum capacity of each train from 600 to 800 passengers, so when enough new LRT cars arrive to lengthen all trains to four cars, the upgrade will increase the LRT <b>system</b> <b>capacity</b> by 33%. Since the platforms on the original stations were designed to only accommodate three-car trains, this required lengthening most of the platforms on the 45 stations on the system and building new electrical substations to power the longer trains. To operate the new four-car trains, the city ordered 63 new cars, although 28 of them were intended to replace the original U2 LRT cars, which have as much as 2.8 million miles on them and are approaching {{the end of their}} service lives. Many of the older stations were also worn out by high passenger traffic, and the platforms needed to be rebuilt anyway.|$|E

When the lake gets over that point, gates from the {{spillway}} are opened, releasing water; 2005 and 2006 were dry years, sending {{the lake to}} a record low on December 12, 2006. The lake fell to 8.04ft(2.45m) below normal, at 313.96ft(95.7m). This passed the old record of 6.22ft(2m) low set on May 8, 1981. That afternoon, the lake received over 4in(102mm) of rain, causing the lake to rise about 6in(152mm). This was the first significant rainfall since April 2006. It was the big turning point for the drought in North Texas, as more rain continued through the month. By January 1, the lake was only a little over 6 feet (2 m) low. Huge rainstorms throughout January brought the lake to only 2 feet (0.6 m) low. A bit of a break came in February, as mainly snow and ice added to the lake rising. By March 31, 2007, the lake was at 322.12ft(98.18m) and the flood gates were open {{for the first time}} since April 20, 2005. Lake Benbrook, Lake Worth, and Lake Arlington also filled up in these rains. Later on, Richland-Chambers Reservoir filled up all the way, then Eagle Mountain, and then on June 30, 2007, Lake Bridgeport was full {{for the first time since}} May 15, 2001, more than six years since the flood gates had been open. It was a milestone for Tarrant regional water district having all seven of their lakes full. On the night of July 5, more than 5in(127mm) of rain fell, sending Cedar Creek lake from a half foot (15cm) over to 1.5 feet (45cm) over, beating the old 1.47ft(0m) set in November 2001.|$|E

At first, a radical redesign was envisioned with a completely new wing and Pratt & Whitney J75 engines. This was rejected to avoid slowdowns in production, although {{a large number of}} changes were implemented. The most significant of these was a new [...] "wet" [...] wing with integral fuel tanks, increasing gross aircraft weight by 38,000pounds (17,235kg). In addition, a pair of 700USgallon (2,650L) external fuel tanks were fitted under the wings on wet hardpoints. The traditional ailerons were also eliminated, and instead, spoilers provided roll control. The tail fin was shortened by 8feet (2.4m), water injection <b>system</b> <b>capacity</b> was increased to 1,200USgallons (4,540L), and the nose radome was enlarged. The tail gunner was relocated to the main cockpit and was provided with an ejection seat.

The B-52G entered service on 13 February 1959 (a day earlier, the last B-36 was retired, making SAC an all-jet bomber force). 193 B-52Gs were produced, making this the most produced B-52 variant. Most B-52Gs were destroyed in compliance with the 1992 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty; the last B-52G, number 58-0224, was dismantled under New START treaty requirements in December 2013.

40|$|Concerns {{with the}} use of {{engineering}} approaches in biology have recently been raised. I examine two related challenges to biological research that I call the synchronic and diachronic underdetermination problem. The former refers to challenges associated with the inference of design principles underlying <b>system</b> <b>capacities</b> when the synchronic relations between lower-level processes and higher-level <b>systems</b> <b>capacities</b> are degenerate (many-to-many). The diachronic underdetermination problem regards the problem of reverse engineering a system where the non-linear relations between <b>system</b> <b>capacities</b> and lower-level mechanisms are changing over time. Braun and Marom argue that recent insights to biological complexity leave the aim of reverse engineering hopeless - in principle as well as in practice. While I support their call for systemic approaches to capture the dynamic nature of living systems, I take issue with the conflation of reverse engineering with naïve reductionism. I clarify how the notion of design principles can be more broadly conceived and argue that reverse engineering is compatible with a dynamic view of organisms. It may even help to facilitate an integrated account that bridges the gap between mechanistic and systems approaches...|$|R
