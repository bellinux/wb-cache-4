25|$|Situated {{along the}} {{perimeter}} of the adrenal gland, the adrenal cortex mediates the stress response through the production of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, such as aldosterone and cortisol, respectively. It is also a <b>secondary</b> <b>site</b> of androgen synthesis. Recent data suggest that adrenocortical cells under pathological as well as under physiological conditions show neuroendocrine properties; within the normal adrenal, this neuroendocrine differentiation seems to be restricted to cells of the zona glomerulosa and might be important for an autocrine regulation of adrenocortical function.|$|E

The X-37B was subsequently transferred to a shrouded configuration on the Atlas V rocket, following concerns over the unshrouded spacecraft's aerodynamic properties during launch. Following their missions, X-37B spacecraft primarily land on a runway at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, with Edwards Air Force Base as a <b>secondary</b> <b>site.</b> In 2010, manufacturing work began on the second X-37B, OTV-2, which conducted its maiden launch in March 2011.|$|E

40|$|Many studies {{report that}} {{herbaceous}} species diversity higher in primary forest than mature secondary forests, but this pattern {{has not yet}} been demonstrated in forests overbrowsed by white-tailed deer. We compared the diversity of herbaceous and tree seedling species in 5 primary and 5 mature secondary riparian zone forest stands in northwestern Pennsylvania, a region which has been overpopulated with white-tailed deer for the past 65 years. We sampled study plots with 16 1 -m 2 quadrats and recorded herb and tree seedling species presence and abundance. At the 1 -m 2 scale, primary forest sites had significantly more tree seedling species per quadrat but the number of herb species per quadrat in primary a <b>secondary</b> forest <b>sites</b> was not significantly different. At the 2. 25 ha scale, primary forest sites had significant higher herb and tree seedling richness than <b>secondary</b> <b>sites.</b> Herbs and tree seedlings also exhibited significantly greater evenness in primary <b>sites</b> than <b>secondary</b> <b>sites.</b> There was considerable species composition overlap between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>sites.</b> Tsuga canadensis, Fagus grandifolia, and Oxalis acetosella had a significantly higher frequency of occurrence and significantly greater abundance in primary forest sites, whereas Prunus serotina and Erythronium americanum had a significantly higher frequency of occurrence and significantly greater abundance in <b>secondary</b> forest <b>sites.</b> Acer rubrum was also significantly more abundant in <b>secondary</b> growth <b>sites.</b> We hypothesize that the trend towards greater diversity in primary forest plots {{is the result of the}} stands experiencing levels of disturbance closer to the historic disturbance regime...|$|R
25|$|There {{has been}} little archaeological work done in the area. The main site is called the Ruins of Berlin, named after German {{explorer}} Heinrich Berlin, who visited the area in 1946 and named the area “Sumidero". This site is located seven km from the Belisario Domínguez Bridge in Tuxtla {{on the edge of}} the river. It covers an area of 467 by 60 meters, bounded by small mounds surrounding patios. The original description of the site was undertaken in 1923 and 1932 by Becerra, who called it Chiapa Viejo, and stated it was the capital of the Chiapa people. However, Remesal in 1966 determined it was a <b>secondary</b> <b>site.</b> The last major survey was done in 1976 by Alejandro Martínez, discovering that there are 24 individual sites of which nine are mounds and fifteen are in caves. One of these contains cave paintings which indicate that the area has been occupied since at least the very early Pre Classic period.|$|E

40|$|Lyme disease {{begins at}} the site of a tick bite, {{producing}} a primary infection with spread of the organism to <b>secondary</b> <b>sites</b> occurring early in the course of infection. A major outer surface protein expressed by the spirochete early in infection is outer surface protein C (OspC). In Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, OspC is highly variable. Based on sequence divergence, alleles of ospC can be divided into 21 major groups. To assess whether strain differences defined by ospC group are linked to invasiveness and pathogenicity, we compared the frequency distributions of major ospC groups from ticks, from the primary erythema migrans skin lesion, and from <b>secondary</b> <b>sites,</b> principally from blood and spinal fluid. The frequency distribution of ospC groups from ticks is significantly different from that from primary sites, which in turn is significantly different from that from <b>secondary</b> <b>sites.</b> The major groups A, B, I, and K had higher frequencies in the primary sites than in ticks and were the only groups found in <b>secondary</b> <b>sites.</b> We define three categories of major ospC groups: one that is common in ticks but very rarely if ever causes human disease, a second that causes only local infection at the tick bite site, and a third that causes systemic disease. The finding that all systemic B. burgdorferi sensu stricto infections are associated with four ospC groups has importance in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Lyme disease...|$|R
500|$|In the 1870s, Fort Garry {{consisted}} of two distinct settlements. The first site was named Upper Fort Garry, and the <b>secondary</b> <b>site</b> was named Lower Fort Garry, [...] downstream on the Red River. After the territorial government moved, Fort Garry continued to be the seat of government for Manitoba, and for the now defunct District of Keewatin territory between 1876 and 1905. Fort Garry evolved to become modern-day Winnipeg, still the capital of Manitoba, with Lower Fort Garry being declared a national historical site.|$|E
500|$|In 1975 Bundy shifted {{much of his}} {{criminal}} activity eastward, from his base in Utah to Colorado. On January 12, a 23-year-old registered nurse named Caryn Eileen Campbell disappeared while walking down a well-lit hallway between the elevator and her room at the Wildwood Inn (now the Wildwood Lodge) in Snowmass Village, [...] southeast of Salt Lake City. Her nude body was found a month later next to a dirt road just outside the resort. She {{had been killed by}} blows to her head from a blunt instrument that left distinctive linear grooved depressions on her skull; her body also bore deep cuts from a sharp weapon. A hundred miles (160km) northeast of Snowmass, on March 15, Vail ski instructor Julie Cunningham, 26, disappeared while walking from her apartment to a dinner date with a friend. Bundy later told Colorado investigators that he approached Cunningham on crutches and asked her to help carry his ski boots to his car, where he clubbed and handcuffed her, then assaulted and strangled her at a <b>secondary</b> <b>site</b> near Rifle, Colorado, [...] west of Vail. Weeks later, he made the six-hour drive from Salt Lake City to revisit her remains.|$|E
500|$|Bundy's {{modus operandi}} evolved in {{organization}} and sophistication over time, as {{is typical of}} serial murderers, according to FBI experts. Early on, it consisted of forcible late-night entry followed by a violent attack with a blunt weapon on a sleeping victim. Some victims were sexually assaulted with inert objects; all except Healy were left as they lay, unconscious or dead. As his methodology evolved Bundy became progressively more organized in his choice of victims and crime scenes. He would employ various ruses designed to lure his victim to the vicinity of his vehicle where he had pre-positioned a weapon, usually a crowbar. In many cases he wore a plaster cast on one leg or a sling on one arm, and sometimes hobbled on crutches, then requested assistance in carrying something to his vehicle. Bundy was regarded as handsome and charismatic by many of his victims, traits he exploited to win their confidence. [...] "Ted lured females", Michaud wrote, [...] "the way a lifeless silk flower can dupe a honey bee." [...] Once near or inside his vehicle the victim would be overpowered, bludgeoned, and restrained with handcuffs. Most were sexually assaulted and strangled, either at the primary crime scene or (more commonly) after transport to a pre-selected <b>secondary</b> <b>site,</b> often a considerable distance away. [...] In situations where his looks and charm were not useful, he invoked authority by identifying himself {{as a police officer}} or firefighter. Toward the end of his spree, in Florida, perhaps under the stress of being a fugitive, he regressed to indiscriminate attacks on sleeping victims.|$|E
30|$|To {{examine how}} the source of {{information}} about SCALE-UP might affect implementation, we created two indices from survey responses, ‘active indicator’ and ‘studio match’, to gauge the fidelity of the pedagogical and structural use of SCALE-UP, respectively. Since we wanted to see how the instructional practices and classrooms of <b>secondary</b> <b>sites</b> related to the original SCALE-UP model, we created these indices to very roughly compare different implementations on a spectrum of fidelity to the original model. These two indices summarize core features of SCALE-UP in a course, but meaningful way and allow us to compare categories of <b>secondary</b> <b>sites</b> in order to see trends in how they use the reform.|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{there have}} been {{proposals}} for scaling-up a database system using lazy replication. In these proposals, system scale-up is achieved through the addition of sec-ondary sites which hold replicas of the database at a pri-mary site. The addition of more <b>secondary</b> <b>sites</b> improves system performance by allowing read-only transactions to be serviced at the <b>secondary</b> <b>sites.</b> However, the scalabil-ity of the distributed system {{is limited by the}} single pri-mary site which services the update workload. As the work-load scales-up, an increasing update load is placed on the primary site, which suffers from performance degradation. We address this problem by proposing a pure lazy solution for scaling-up the database system. Our techniques provide scalability and avoid transaction inversions, which can oc-cur when transactions access stale replicas. 1...|$|R

With sumoylation having a role in various cellular processes like nuclear-cytosolic transport and transcriptional regulation, it is expected CXorf66 is modified by a SUMO protein post-translation.|$|E
2500|$|Under Paul Herzog, the NLRB {{made two}} {{decisions}} involving secondary picketing.

But was picketing the truck while it visited a secondary employer (the <b>secondary</b> <b>site,</b> or [...] "secondary situs" [...] in the Latin phrase) a violation of Section 8(b)(4)? The Herzog Board said no. The second decision, Crowley's Milk Co., addressed the purpose of [...] "secondary situs" [...] picketing. Section 8(b)(4) of the Taft-Hartley Act (enacted the year before Crowley's Milk was decided) forbade secondary boycotts. But did it forbid secondary picketing? Could the union's freedom of speech extend to [...] "secondary situs" [...] picketing if the sole purpose of the picketing was to persuade consumers to boycott the secondary employer?
