25|$|Novak's {{movies were}} {{often based on}} outdoor stories. Some of these include Treat 'Em Rough (1919), Kazan (1921), Isobel (1920), The River's End (1920), and The Rosary (1922).

500|$|When her son {{became a}} member of The Beatles, Mona {{repeatedly}} tried to get the group a lunchtime residency at The Cavern Club by talking to the owner, Ray McFall, but was turned down, as The Cavern had a jazz-only policy at the time. Brian Epstein later wanted to manage the group, and Mona was asked for her advice, and although <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> plans for the group, she concluded that Epstein would be good for them over time. After The Beatles signed a management contract with Epstein, Mona did not relinquish her control over them, as they had been using her telephone to call agents, and frequently slept over in her living room between concerts. She constantly harassed Epstein about the quality of their bookings, and his management of them, which led to Epstein never referring to her by name, but always calling her [...] "that woman". One musician commented that if Mona said it was a Sunday when it was Tuesday, one would be forced to agree with her.|$|E
500|$|When casting [...] "Tall Girl #1" [...] (the {{woman who}} would kiss with Dwight), the show {{was looking for a}} girl 6'1 or taller. Actress Cassie Fliegel, who is 5'11, auditioned for the part anyway. After getting a callback, Fliegel went to a gym to work out, {{attempting}} to gain muscle to look more like a basketball player. On the day of the callbacks, Fliegel remembers being next to a girl who was 6'8. Despite her size, Fliegel, a former basketball player herself, was cast for the part. Initially, she did not know that her character was going to make out with Dwight. Fliegel recalls that when she first heard about kissing Dwight she [...] "was like, I don't think so". However, after finding out that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> trailer, Fliegel warmed up to the idea. The music in the club was chosen by Novak, Kaling's then-boyfriend Benjamin Nugent, and Daniel Chun. When filming Ryan dancing in the club, the girl that Ryan hit was actually a stunt woman. Pads had been placed on the floor so Novak could fall down safely. The German lullaby that Dwight sang to Ryan was script supervisor Veda Semarne's idea. Semarne's Austrian grandmother sang the same song to her when she was a child.|$|E
500|$|A pun, the character's name [...] "Kim Possible" [...] {{alludes to}} the word [...] "impossible". Kim is {{referred}} to by several nicknames by various characters throughout the series, including K.P. (Ron); Kimmy Cub (James); K, Miss Perfect, Tin Teeth (Bonnie); Princess, Pumpkin, Cupcake, Miss Snooty, Miss Priss (Shego); and Kimmie by miscellaneous. Unlike traditional superheroes and secret agents, Kim lacks a secret identity; the character is known simply as [...] "Kim Possible, and everyone who knows her knows what she does." [...] Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle observed that Kim [...] "never put on spandex or acquired a secret identity; instead, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> website where people could book her for jobs with a tagline that promised that she could do anything", a claim reinforced {{by the fact that}} she is capable of fighting crime while continuing to perform well in high school and remaining captain of her school's cheerleading squad. Writing for Women Write About Comics, Jamie Kingston observed that Middleton High School [...] "ignores her as a heroine unless something happens on school grounds where she has to do her thing." [...] Thus, Kim rarely receives attention for her work from her family and peers, although her customers remain grateful. However, while describing Kim as a [...] "power fantasy", Stealing Commas believes that Kim is simply [...] "preventing regime change" [...] and [...] "Preserving the status quo rather than doing any real world saving." [...] According to Metacritic, Kim [...] "is stubborn, strong-willed, and has a fuse shorter than a grenade with a three second delay" [...] but remains [...] "extremely humble, refusing to take credit for her truly amazing actions." [...] Meanwhile, David Horiuchi of Amazon.com wrote that the character is [...] "tough, witty, and refreshingly free of any saucy teen attitude." ...|$|E

2500|$|After realizing she had missed, {{she raised}} her arm again, and Oliver Sipple, a former Marine, dived towards her and grabbed her arm, {{possibly}} saving President Ford's life. Sipple said at the time: [...] "I saw [...] pointed out there and I grabbed for it. [...] I lunged and grabbed the woman's arm and the gun went off." [...] The bullet from the second shot ricocheted and hit John Ludwig, a 42-year-old taxi driver. Ludwig survived.

2500|$|At {{its height}} in Elizabeth de Burgh's time the castle offered {{substantial}} employment, perhaps 250 persons not counted amongst the townspeople.
