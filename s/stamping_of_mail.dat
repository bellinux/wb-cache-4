50|$|Gault’s “New Metallic Currency” {{was only}} a {{momentary}} success. His currency circulated for close to a year {{until the middle of}} 1863 when fractional currency issued by the government became popular enough to ease the coin shortage. There were a few factors that allowed Gault’s invention to thrive for only a short time. One of the main reasons was stamps needed for postage became unavailable. Too many postage stamps were being diverted from their main purpose and used as currency {{to the point that the}} solution for a shortage of coins created a shortage <b>of</b> <b>stamps</b> for <b>mail</b> purposes. Secondly, the coins were expensive. It cost more to buy the encased postage than what they were actually valued at in the market. Thus, a cheaper solution for the coin shortage was sought after. For example, Private issue Civil War tokens existed and implementation of fractional currency came not too long after Gault created encased postage. Finally, Gault lacked a high enough demand for companies willing to buy advertising space on the back of his coins. This absence of demand made it costly for him to keep producing encased postage.|$|R
