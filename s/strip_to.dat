5|$|During this period, Hergé {{also contributed}} to L'Ouest (The West), a {{newspaper}} run by his friend Raymond De Becker. L'Ouest urged Belgium to remain neutral in World War II, a stance Hergé supported, creating the Mr Bellum <b>strip</b> <b>to</b> argue this position. Hergé was invited to visit China by Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, who had enjoyed The Blue Lotus, although due to the political situation in Europe, this was not possible. He was re-mobilized in December, and stationed in Antwerp, from where he continued to send the Tintin <b>strip</b> <b>to</b> Le Petit Vingtième. However, he fell ill with sinusitis and boils and was declared unfit for military service in May 1940. That same day, Germany invaded Belgium. Le Vingtième Siècle was shut down, part way through the serialisation of Land of Black Gold.|$|E
5|$|Travers was {{replaced}} by former Yeovil Town manager Dave Halliday, {{one of more than}} a hundred applicants for the role, and the club moved from their black and gold <b>strip</b> <b>to</b> red and white.

For these six years, the club was temporarily taken over by then-directors Charles B Forbes and George Anderson while Halliday served in the war.|$|E

5|$|Heavy rains {{that preceded}} the storm forced {{thousands}} of gamblers along the Las Vegas <b>Strip</b> <b>to</b> be evacuated and left two people missing. The remnants of the storm later moved into the region, bringing additional flooding. Many parking lots in the resort town of Laughlin were flooded. Furthermore, the villages of Searchlight and Blue Diamond were isolated due to flooding. Several major streets in Paradise were closed because of flooding and sandbag barriers were erected alongside Caesars Palace to prevent further flood damage. In addition, record river levels were measured along the Amargosa River near Death Valley.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to accessories {{such as the}} Power Base Converter, the Sega Genesis supports two add-ons that each support their own game libraries. The first is the Sega CD (known as the Mega-CD in all regions except for North America), a compact disc-based peripheral that can play its library of games in CD-ROM format. The second is the Sega 32X, a 32-bit peripheral which uses ROM cartridges {{and serves as a}} pass-through for Genesis games. Sega produced a custom power <b>strip</b> <b>to</b> fit the peripherals' large AC adapters. Both add-ons were officially discontinued in 1996.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota {{has four}} {{ecological}} provinces: Prairie Parkland, {{in the southwestern}} and western parts of the state; the Eastern Broadleaf Forest (Big Woods) in the southeast, extending in a narrowing <b>strip</b> <b>to</b> the state's northwestern part, where it transitions into Tallgrass Aspen Parkland; and the northern Laurentian Mixed Forest, a transitional forest between the northern boreal forest and the broadleaf forests to the south. These northern forests are a vast wilderness of pine and spruce trees mixed with patchy stands of birch and poplar.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Brigade's {{goal for}} 11 June was {{to secure the}} {{airfield}} area. The 2/43rd Battalion patrolled {{to the north and}} west of the airfield during the day, meeting only light opposition. In contrast, the 2/28th Battalion (which was tasked with advancing into Labuan's interior) encountered entrenched Japanese forces, and it became clear that it was facing {{the main body of the}} island's garrison. Norman manoeuvred his companies to push the Japanese back, but the rate of advance was slow. The airfield engineers of No. 62 Wing RAAF were also landed during 11 June to begin work on returning No. 1 <b>Strip</b> <b>to</b> service; reconstruction of the airfield began the next day.|$|E
5|$|The Committee on Territories again {{rejected}} Weaver's bill, but {{approved a}} compromise measure {{that opened the}} Unassigned Lands, Cherokee Outlet, and Neutral <b>Strip</b> <b>to</b> settlement. Congress debated the bill over several months, while the tribes announced their resistance to their lands becoming a territory; according to an 1884 Supreme Court decision, Elkv. Wilkins, Native Americans were not citizens, and thus would have no voting rights in the new territory. When Weaver returned to Iowa to campaign for re-election, the bill was still in limbo. Running again on a Democratic–Greenback fusion ticket, Weaver was re-elected to the House in 1886 with a 618-vote majority.|$|E

5|$|The first widely {{distributed}} comic <b>strip</b> <b>to</b> tackle LGBT themes {{and include a}} gay character was Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury. The strip introduced the character Andy Lippincott in 1976, and his diagnosis with HIV in 1989 and AIDS related death in 1990 was the first representation of this issue in comic strips. This storyline led to a Pulitzer Prize nomination for Trudeau, but three newspapers of the 900 carrying the strip refused to publish it as being in bad taste. Two years later, the long-standing character Mark Slackmeyer was revealed to be gay, continuing a reputation for controversial content. Slackmeyer, a liberal, continues to feature in the strip, with focus on {{his relationship with his}} politically conservative partner, Chase, including their marriage in 1999 and separation in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Through French {{pressure}} on Libya and {{the mediation of}} Nigerien President Hamani Diori, the two countries resumed diplomatic relations on 17 April 1972. Shortly after, Tombalbaye broke diplomatic relations with Israel and {{is said to have}} secretly agreed on 28 November to cede the Aouzou <b>Strip</b> <b>to</b> Libya. In exchange, Gaddafi pledged 40 million pounds to the Chadian President and the two countries signed a Treaty of Friendship in December 1972. Gaddafi withdrew official support to the FROLINAT and forced its leader Abba Siddick to move his headquarters from Tripoli to Algiers. Good relations were confirmed in the following years, with Gaddafi visiting the Chadian capital N'Djamena in March 1974; in the same month a joint bank was created to provide Chad with investment funds.|$|E
5|$|When Chandler was 14, {{he began}} {{stealing}} cars and was arrested 20times as a juvenile. As an adult, {{he was charged}} with a variety of crimes, including possession of counterfeit money, loitering and prowling, burglary, kidnapping, and armed robbery. He was also accused of masturbating while peering inside a woman's window. In one incident, Chandler and an accomplice broke into a Florida couple's home, held them at gunpoint, and robbed them. Chandler told his accomplice to tie up the man with speaker wire and took the woman into the bedroom, where he made her <b>strip</b> <b>to</b> her underwear, tied her up, and rubbed the barrel of his revolver across her stomach.|$|E

5|$|After another {{supermarket}} <b>strip</b> <b>to</b> the east, a long, gentle divided bend in {{the road}} almost a mile long ends with an overpass where NY55 comes in from the west. It joins NY22 as the two routes, returning to two lanes, pass through the eastern fringe of the village of Pawling and then by Trinity-Pawling School. Past the village, the railroad tracks edge closer to the highway as NY22 enters the scenic Harlem Valley, which lends {{its name to the}} railroad line. The road curves more gently and takes longer straightaways, with lower density of residential and commercial development. Two miles from Pawling, the Appalachian Trail crosses the road next to the line's Appalachian Trail station. The flag stop allows hikers access to the nearby Pawling Nature Preserve.|$|E
5|$|After marrying, Segrè {{sought a}} stable job and became {{professor}} of physics {{and director of the}} Physics Institute at the University of Palermo. He found the equipment there primitive and the library bereft of modern physics literature, but his colleagues at Palermo included the mathematicians Michele Cipolla and Michele De Franchis, the mineralogist Carlo Perrier and the botanist Luigi Montemartini. In 1936 he paid a visit to Ernest O. Lawrence's Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, where he met Edwin McMillan, Donald Cooksey, Franz Kurie, Philip Abelson and Robert Oppenheimer. Segrè was intrigued by the radioactive scrap metal that had once been part of the laboratory's cyclotron. In Palermo, this was found to contain a number of radioactive isotopes. In February 1937, Lawrence sent him a molybdenum strip that was emitting anomalous forms of radioactivity. Segrè enlisted Perrier's help to subject the <b>strip</b> <b>to</b> careful chemical and theoretical analysis, {{and they were able to}} prove that some of the radiation was being produced by a previously unknown element. In 1947 they named it technetium, as it was the first artificially synthesized chemical element.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of Poland, Hergé was conscripted into the Belgian Army and temporarily stationed in Herenthout. Discharged within the month, {{he returned to}} Brussels and began Land of Black Gold. The story subsequently began serialisation in Le Vingtième Siècle on 25 September 1939. He was re-mobilised in December and stationed in Antwerp, from where he continued to send the Tintin <b>strip</b> <b>to</b> Le Petit Vingtième. However, he fell ill with sinusitis and boils and was declared unfit for service in May 1940. That same day, Germany invaded Belgium, and Le Vingtième Siècle was shut down part way through the serialisation of Land of Black Gold, on 8 May. The {{point at which the}} story was ended corresponds to page 30 of the current book edition, when Tintin is about to be caught in a sandstorm following his first confrontation with Muller.|$|E

5|$|Raymond's father {{encouraged}} {{his love}} of drawing from an early age, leading him to become an assistant illustrator in the early 1930s on strips such as Tillie the Toiler and Tim Tyler's Luck. Towards the end of 1933, Raymond created the epic Flash Gordon science-fiction comic <b>strip</b> <b>to</b> compete with the popular Buck Rogers comic strip and, before long, Flash was the more popular strip of the two. Raymond also worked on the jungle adventure saga Jungle Jim and spy adventure Secret Agent X-9 concurrently with Flash, though his increasing workload caused him to leave Secret Agent X-9 to another artist by 1935. He left the strips in 1944 to join the Marines, saw combat in the Pacific Ocean theater in 1945 and was demobilized in 1946. Upon his return from serving during World War II, Raymond created and illustrated the much-heralded Rip Kirby, a private detective comic strip. In 1956, Raymond {{was killed in a}} car crash at the age of 46; he was survived by his wife and five children.|$|E
5|$|When winter {{came and}} there was no work {{available}} on the ranches, he collaborated with Christin on a six-page strip called Le Rhum du Punch, a copy of which he sent to Jean Giraud who was by now writing and illustrating Blueberry for the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Pilote. Giraud showed the <b>strip</b> <b>to</b> Pilotes editor, Rene Goscinny, who agreed to publish it (issue 335, 24 March 1966). This was followed by another collaboration titled Comment réussir en affaires en se donnant un mal fou (How to succeed in business by almost killing oneself through hard work) which was also published in Pilote (issue 351, 14 July 1966). By this stage Mézières visa was almost expired and so he used the money from these strips to pay for his ticket home. In leaving America, Mézières also left behind a young woman, Linda, one of Christin's students: she followed him to France some months later and is now his wife.|$|E
5|$|Fares on BART are {{comparable}} to those of commuter rail systems and are higher than those of most subways, especially for long trips. The fare is based on a formula that takes into account both the length and speed of the trip. A surcharge is added for trips traveling through the Transbay Tube, to Oakland International Airport, to San Francisco International Airport, and/or through San Mateo County, a county that is {{not a member of the}} San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District. Passengers can use refillable paper-plastic-composite tickets, on which fares are stored via a magnetic <b>strip,</b> <b>to</b> enter and exit the system. The exit faregate prints the remaining balance on the ticket each time the passenger exits the station. A paper ticket can be refilled at a ticket machine, the remaining balance on any ticket can be applied towards the purchase of a new one, or a card is captured by the exit gate when the balance reaches zero; multiple low value cards can be combined to create a larger value card but only at specific ticket exchange locations, located at some BART stations. The magnetic strip-based technology was developed by Cubic Transportation Systems with a contract awarded in 1974.|$|E
