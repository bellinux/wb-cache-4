5|$|Silkworms, the {{caterpillars}} and pupae of {{the moth}} Bombyx mori, have been reared to produce silk in China from the Neolithic Yangshao period onwards, c. 5000 BC. Production spread to India by 140 AD. The caterpillars are fed on mulberry leaves. The cocoon, produced after the fourth moult, {{is covered with}} a continuous filament of the <b>silk</b> <b>protein,</b> fibroin, gummed together with sericin. In the traditional process, the gum is removed by soaking in hot water, and the silk is then unwound from the cocoon and reeled. Filaments are spun together to make silk thread. Commerce in silk between China and countries to its west began in ancient times, with silk known from an Egyptian mummy of 1070 BC, and later to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The silk road leading west from China was opened in the second century AD, helping to drive trade in silk and other goods.|$|E
25|$|One {{approach}} {{that does not}} involve farming spiders is to extract the spider silk gene and use other organisms to produce the spider silk. Working under the trademark BioSteel, in 2000 Canadian biotechnology company Nexia successfully produced spider <b>silk</b> <b>protein</b> in transgenic goats that carried the gene for it; the milk produced by the goats contained significant quantities of the protein, 1–2grams of silk proteins per litre of milk. Attempts to spin the protein into a fibre similar to natural spider silk resulted in fibres with tenacities of 2–3grams per denier.

25|$|In {{addition}} to spiders, silkworms are {{another source of}} <b>silk.</b> <b>Protein</b> from Bombyx mori silkworms is a core of fibroin protein surrounded by sericin, which is a family of glue-like proteins. Fibroin has been characterized as a heavy chain with a repeated hydrophobic and crystallizable sequence: Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-Gly-X (X stands for Ser or Tyr). The surrounding sericin is more hydrophilic due to many polar residues, but it does still have some hydrophobic β-sheet portions. Silks have been long been used as sutures due to their high mechanical strength and flexibility as well as permeability to water and oxygen. In addition, silk fibroin can be easily manipulated and sterilized. However, silk use halted when undesirable immunological reactions were reported. Recently, it has been discovered {{that the cause of}} the immunological problems lies solely with the surrounding sericin. Since this discovery, silk with the sericin removed has been used in many pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. Because it is necessary to remove the sericin from around the fibroin before the silk can be used, an efficient procedure needs to be developed for its removal, which is known as degumming. One degrumming method uses boiling aqueous Na2CO3 solution, which removes the sericin without damaging the fibroin. Yang, Chen et al. demonstrated that the silk fibroin and silk fibroin extract fluid show good biocompatibility with Schwann cells, with no cytotoxic effects on proliferation.|$|E

40|$|Arthropods face {{several key}} {{challenges}} in processing concentrated feedstocks of <b>proteins</b> (<b>silk</b> dope) into solid, semi-crystalline silk fibres. Strikingly, independently evolved lineages of silk-producing organisms have {{converged on the}} use of liquid crystal intermediates (mesophases) to reduce the viscosity of silk dope and assist the formation of supramolecular structure. However, the exact nature of the liquid-crystal-forming-units (mesogens) in silk dope, and the relationship between liquid crystallinity, <b>protein</b> structure and <b>silk</b> processing is yet to be fully elucidated. In this review, we focus on emerging differences in this area between the canonical silks containing extended-β-sheets made by silkworms and spiders, and ‘non-canonical’ silks made by other insect taxa in which the final crystallites are coiled-coils, collagen helices or cross-β-sheets. We compared the amino acid sequences and processing of natural, regenerated and recombinant <b>silk</b> <b>proteins,</b> finding that canonical and non-canonical <b>silk</b> <b>proteins</b> show marked differences in length, architecture, amino acid content and <b>protein</b> folding. Canonical <b>silk</b> <b>proteins</b> are long, flexible in solution and amphipathic; these features allow them both to form large, micelle-like mesogens in solution, and to transition to a crystallite-containing form due to mechanical deformation near the liquid–solid transition. By contrast, non-canonical <b>silk</b> <b>proteins</b> are short and have rod or lath-like structures that are well suited to act both as mesogens and as crystallites without a major intervening phase transition. Given many non-canonical <b>silk</b> <b>proteins</b> can be produced at high yield in E. coli, and that mesophase formation is a versatile way to direct numerous kinds of supramolecular structure, further elucidation of the natural processing of non-canonical <b>silk</b> <b>proteins</b> may to lead to new developments in the production of advanced protein materials...|$|R

40|$|Spiders and {{silkworms}} spin silks that outcompete the toughness of {{all natural}} and manmade fibers. Herein, we {{compare and contrast}} the spinning of silk in silkworms and spiders, {{with the aim of}} identifying features that are important for fiber formation. Although spiders and silkworms are very distantly related, some features of spinning silk seem to be universal. Both spiders and silkworms produce large <b>silk</b> <b>proteins</b> that are highly repetitive and extremely soluble at high pH, likely due to the globular terminal domains that flank an intermediate repetitive region. The <b>silk</b> <b>proteins</b> are produced and stored at a very high concentration in glands, and then transported along a narrowing tube in which they change conformation in response primarily to a pH gradient generated by carbonic anhydrase and proton pumps, as well as to ions and shear forces. The <b>silk</b> <b>proteins</b> thereby convert from random coil and alpha helical soluble conformations to beta sheet fibers. We suggest that factors that need to be optimized for successful production of artificial <b>silk</b> <b>proteins</b> capable of forming tough fibers include protein solubility, pH sensitivity, and preservation of natively folded proteins throughout the purification and initial spinning processes...|$|R

Results from two probe microscopy techniques provide new insights into {{the structure of}} spider dragline silk.
