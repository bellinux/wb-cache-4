40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to investigate the effect of interlinings orientation upon fused textile <b>systems</b> <b>resilience</b> and to define the relation between fused textile systems pendulum impact behaviour (biaxial deformation) and mechanical properties determined by KES-F system (uniaxial deformation). Outer fabric and two interlinings with polymer adhesive layer: non-woven with longitudinal threads P 1 and warp knitted TR 1 were investigated. Fused textile systems were formed by changing the orientation of interlinings at: 0  (system PAR), 90  (system PER) and 45  (system B) degrees in respect to outer fabric warp direction. For the investigations of fused textile <b>systems</b> <b>resilience</b> properties computerized pendulum impact device was applied. Tensile properties were determined using KES-F system. The investigations of the effect of interlinings orientation upon fused textile <b>systems</b> <b>resilience</b> have shown that this property is the highest for B <b>systems.</b> <b>Resilience</b> of fused textile PAR systems is the lowest because tensile strength of interlinings in longitudinal direction defined by KES-F system is the highest. Meantime for fused PER systems it is no difference which interlining can be chosen for fusing because resilience properties of both systems are almost similar. The investigations of bilayed fused textile systems have revealed that the parameters of biaxial behaviour obtained in impact loading are related with the anisotropy of tensile strain EMT and tensile resilience RT determined by uniaxial KES-F testing, i. e. the increase of rebound angle α 1 and decrease of impact angle β 1 are closely related with the decrease of EMT and RT anisotropy...|$|R
40|$|Health <b>systems</b> <b>resilience</b> is an {{emerging}} issue in health policy and systems research, yet limited information exists on how resilient health systems are developed {{and the different}} elements that contribute to whole (national) health <b>systems</b> <b>resilience.</b> In this study, resilience is understood from the socio-ecological lens applicable for complex adaptive <b>systems.</b> <b>Resilience</b> therefore {{is not only the}} ability of a health system to address disturbances and restore its basic structures and functions, but also the ability of a health system to transform or re-organise in response to a disturbance if the current system is no longer tenable for the context. Along with the rise in the interest in health <b>systems</b> <b>resilience</b> is a renewed focus on partnership with nonstate providers (NSPs) to complement national health systems. The role of NSPs in supporting health <b>systems</b> <b>resilience</b> however has been largely unexplored. This study thus explores the topic of resilience with respect to health systems and focuses on a particular NSP type – namely, faith-based health providers (FBHPs). It describes four country cases of Ghana, Malawi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and South Sudan - where FBHPs, though their inclusion in the health system and the activities they undertook, appear to have influenced the resilience of national health systems. FBHPs have played critical roles in strengthening health systems, which has been argued to be a key source of resilience. Their presence also diversified the actors in the health system, enabling them to step in as an alternative service provider when government services were unavailable. Historically, FBHPs appeared to be more flexible which allowed them to respond more quickly during times of crises. This flexibility in operations, coupled with their mission to serve marginalized populations, have supported the development of innovations for the poor, which in some instances have been adopted by national governments. As such, FBHPs have not only acted as buffers in times of shocks or stressors, but have also supported the transformation of national health systems for the better. Recent trends of closer integration with governments however are increasing the interdependencies between FBHPs and the public sector, which have potential to make health systems more vulnerable and less resilient...|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the challenges of}} prediction and integration of the benign human with control systems, the abilities of the malicious actor (or hacker) to undermine desired control system behavior also create a significant challenge to control <b>system</b> <b>resilience.</b> Application of dynamic probabilistic risk analysis used in human reliability can provide some basis for the benign actor. However, the decidedly malicious intentions of an adversarial individual, organization or nation make the modeling of the human variable in both objectives and motives. However, in defining a control system response to such intentions, the malicious actor looks forward to some level of recognized behavior to gain an advantage and provide a pathway to undermining the system. Whether performed separately in preparation for a cyber attack, or on the system itself, these behaviors can provide opportunity for a successful attack without detection. Therefore, in considering resilient control system architecture, atypical designs that imbed active and passively implemented randomization of attributes, would be suggested to reduce this advantage.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} <b>systems</b> <b>resilience</b> as a new framework for {{thinking about the future}} of nonproliferation. Resilience refers to the ability of a system to maintain its vital functions in the face of continuous and unpredictable change. The nonproliferation regime {{can be viewed as a}} complex system, and key themes from the literature on <b>systems</b> <b>resilience</b> can be applied to the nonproliferation system. Most existing nonproliferation strategies are aimed at stability rather than resilience, and the current nonproliferation system may be over-constrained by the cumulative evolution of strategies, increasing its vulnerability to collapse. The resilience of the nonproliferation system can be enhanced by diversifying nonproliferation strategies to include general international capabilities to respond to proliferation and focusing more attention on reducing the motivation to acquire nuclear weapons in the first place. Ideas for future research, include understanding unintended consequences and feedbacks among nonproliferation strategies, developing methodologies for measuring the resilience of the nonproliferation system, and accounting for interactions of the nonproliferation system with other systems on larger and smaller scales...|$|R

There can {{be highly}} resilient states of ecosystems which are very undesirable from some human perspectives , such as algal-dominated coral reefs.” Ecological resilience is a “capacity” that varies depending upon which properties of the ecosystem are to be studied and depending upon what kinds of disturbances are considered {{and how they are}} to be quantified. Approaches to assessing it “face high uncertainties and still require a considerable amount of empirical and theoretical research.” Other authors have sought a numerical index of ecosystem health that would permit quantitative comparisons among ecosystems and within ecosystems over time. One such system employs ratings of the three properties mentioned above: Health = system vigor x system organization x <b>system</b> <b>resilience.</b> Ecologist Glenn Suter argues that such indices employ “nonsense units,” the indices have “no meaning; they cannot be predicted, so they are not applicable to most regulatory problems; they have no diagnostic power; effects of one component are eclipsed by responses of other components, and the reason for a high or low index value is unknown.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The use of {{the term}} “recovery” has been used in the context of resilience, {{paralleling}} the response of a rubber ball to stay intact when a force is exerted on it and recover its original dimensions after the force is removed. Considering the rubber ball in terms of a <b>system,</b> <b>resilience</b> could then be defined as its ability to maintain a desired level of performance or normalcy without irrecoverable consequences. While resilience in this context is based upon the yield strength of the ball, control systems require an interaction with the environment, namely the sensors, valves, pumps that make up the industrial operation. To be reactive to this environment, control systems require an awareness of its state to make corrective changes to the industrial process to maintain normalcy. With this in mind, in consideration of the discussed cyber-physical aspects of human systems integration and cyber security, as well as other definitions for resilience at a broader critical infrastructure level, the following can be deduced as a definition of a resilient control system: ...|$|E
40|$|Resilience has, in {{the past}} four decades, been a term {{increasingly}} employed throughout a number of sciences: psychology and ecology, most prominently. Increasingly one finds it in political science, business administration, sociology, history, disaster planning, urban planning, and international development. The shared use of the term does not, however, imply unified concepts of resilience nor the theories in which it is embedded. Different uses generate different methods, sometimes different methodologies. Evidential or other empirical support can differ between domains of application, even when concepts are broadly shared. The review centres on three resilience frameworks, of increasing complexity: Engineering Resilience (or ‘Common Sense’ resilience); <b>Systems</b> <b>Resilience,</b> called Robustness in economics; and Resilience in Complex Adaptive Systems. Although each framework has historical roots in particular disciplines, the frameworks themselves can be applied to any domain: Engineering Resilience is utilised in some child development studies; <b>Systems</b> <b>Resilience</b> is often used in governance and management; and the Complex Adaptive Systems approach has been applied to economics, innovation in technology, history, and urban planning.
