Frondizi, a proponent of developmentalism, opposed Alsogaray's austerity program, which brought down inflation, though at the cost of a severe recession in 1959. Alsogaray was replaced in April 1961 by Roberto Alemann. Alemann's structuralist approach complemented unofficial Frondizi point man Rogelio Julio Frigerio's policies well, as both focused on correcting the adverse effects of financing increasingly costly machinery imports with raw material exports of declining value (a terms of trade problem common to developing countries), though conservative and military pressure resulted in his removal in January 1962.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} optimal {{monetary policy}} {{in response to}} shocks using a model that avoids making specific assumptions about the stickiness of prices, and thus {{the nature of the}} Phillips curve. Nonetheless, certain robust features of the optimal monetary policy commitment are found. The optimal policy rule is a flexible inflation target which is adhered to in the short run without any accommodation of <b>structural</b> <b>inflation</b> persistence, that is, inflation which it is costly to eliminate. The target is also made more stringent when it has been missed in the past. With discretion on the other hand, the target is loosened to accommodate fully any <b>structural</b> <b>inflation</b> persistence, and any past deviations from the inflation target are ignored. These results apply {{to a wide range of}} price stickiness models because the market failure which the policymaker should aim to mitigate arises from imperfect competition, not from price stickiness itself.

The South African rate of inflation has, {{by the time this}} study was undertaken, showed resistance to reduce in the face of several years of demand management policies. It was this resistance that led to the idea that the South African inflation rate might be the result of several structural factors in the economy. The study was done in three separate stages. In the first, a study of the conventional theories of inflation, the demand-pull and cost push theories, was done. The main objective was to establish whether inflation could be controlled by the medicine these theories prescribed. In section two, the different schools of thought as regards the structural approach to inflation were analyzed. The structuralist school, developed during the late 1950 s, described inflation as the result of productivity discrepancies mainly between the agricultural and industrial sectors. The structural school, which developed during the early 1970 s has two variations. The first, the Scandinavian variant, ascribes inflation to the existing productivity gap between the international competing sectors and the domestic sectors, whilst no corresponding gap in salaries between the relevant sectors exists. The second variant designates inflation to the gap existing between the labour productivity in the public and private sectors. Here again, no such salary gap exists between the sectors. The last <b>structural</b> <b>inflation</b> school of thought discussed was the one prevailing in the USA. This school saw inflation {{as the result of the}} unproductive use of capital and labour when measured against the incomes generated by the same factors of production. In section three of the study, the abovementioned theories of <b>structural</b> <b>inflation</b> were empirically applied in the South African context. In all cases very definite pointers, indicating the applicability ·of these theories in the South African situation were found. In all cases two main sector groups were constructed; each consisted as the sum of the weighted productivity of wages of the sectors belonging to that sector group i. e. internationally or domestically competitive and public or private competing groups.

The event deserves more attention for both academic and policy research reasons.

The nature of the inflation was structural rather than monetary. This kind of <b>structural</b> <b>inflation</b> is common in transitional economies. Indeed, it largely characterizes chronic price increases that have occurred in such countries. A proper monetary policy curbing inflation should take into account the structural factor.

40|$|Within New Keynesian economics, the {{optimality}} of {{a monetary}} policy that aims at zero inflation is surprisingly robust. Optimal monetary policy has this character despite the inefficiency of the nonstochastic steady state {{and despite the}} existence of a positively sloped long-run Phillips-curve trade-off. Full price stability remains optimal even under inflation persistence due to backward-looking price indexation by price setters. We show how extending a basic New Keynesian model to the case of inflation persistence due to backward-looking rule-of-thumb behaviour by price setters breaks the surprising robustness of zero long-run inflation target, namely backward-looking rule-of-thumb behaviour by price setters results in optimal positive long-run inflation. Comparing different theoretical explanations for <b>structural</b> <b>inflation</b> persistence suggests that the features that seem capable of delivering an endogenously optimal inflation target are costly disinflation, long-run Phillips-curve trade-off, and steady-state distortions. ...|$|E

The core inflation is obtained by canceling the cyclical component of inflation. Quah and Vahey(1995) use the identification method proposed by Blanchard and Quah(1989) to compute the core inflation in UK. We apply the same technique for France, Germany and UK.

40|$|Reasoning {{within the}} New Neoclassical Synthesis (NNS) we {{previously}} recommended that price stability {{should be the}} primary objective of monetary policy.

We explore the foundations of neutral policy more fully in this paper. Using the principles of public finance, we derive conditions under which markup constancy is optimal monetary policy.

Second, combined data are tested for causality, with the combinations based on variables suggested by the literature - level of per capita income, magnitude of inflation, degree of financial market development, and independence of the central bank.

Explicit hypotheses on an endogenous determination of productivity growth differences are derived from a small macro model and tested on data from 1960 to 1975 for 14 OECD countries divided into two groups: large economies and small open economies. We find empirical support for the hypothesis of a structural explanation of the sectoral productivity growth difference in both large and small economies. For small open economies there is also a significant relationship between product wage disturbances and the relative decline of the tradables sector. The empirical analysis indicates that in these countries productivity growth is the same in both sectors in the absence of product wage disturbances...|$|E

ABSTRACT: Since the creation of money, a good reading of inflation evolutions is an essential element for many economic actors. However, inflation {{as measured by the}} consumer price index represents some volatility. Indeed, since its establishment, the general price index shows a marked seasonality and its level rises irregularly. Therefore, It is essential for a central bank to distinguish in the evolutions of the inflation between what is simply noise, destined to disappear quickly, what is a sustainable trend. In the context of price stability that have adopted the aim of their monetary policy, central banks should control and have an accurate measure of <b>structural</b> <b>inflation,</b> namely the component corrected by the influence of economic cycle, because it is this element that is monetary origin. This component of inflation, called core inflation is obtained by canceling the cyclical component attributed to shocks on output. We try in this work to measure the main component of inflation in Tunisia from a structural VAR. The results comfort the choice of the approach because the calculated core inflation seems broadly in compliance with that waited on the theoretical plan...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} model to price {{inflation}} and interest rates derivatives using continuous-time dynamics that have some links with macroeconomic monetary DSGE models equipped with a Taylor rule: in particular, the reaction function of the central bank, the bond market liquidity, inflation and growth expectations play an important role. The model can explain the effects of non-standard monetary policies (like quantitative easing or its tapering) and shed light on how central bank policy can affect the value of inflation and interest rates derivatives. The model is built under standard no-arbitrage assumptions. Interestingly, the model yields short rate dynamics {{that are consistent with}} a time-varying Hull-White model, therefore making the calibration to the nominal interest curve and options straightforward. Further, we obtain closed forms for both zero-coupon and year-on-year inflation swap and options. The calibration strategy we propose is fully separable, which means that the calibration can be carried out in subsequent simple steps that do not require heavy computation. A market calibration example is provided. The advantages of such <b>structural</b> <b>inflation</b> modelling become apparent when one starts doing risk analysis on an inflation derivatives book: because the model explicitly takes into account economic variables, a trader can easily assess the impact of a change in central bank policy on a complex book of fixed income instruments, which is normally not straightforward if one is using standard inflation pricing models...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the structural}} {{causes of the}} recent Turkish inflationary episode. It is argued that monetary policies based on credit tightening alone {{are not likely to}} yield the desired target of price stabilisation. Instead, it is hypothesised that the underlying sources of price inflation are affected by income inequality and conflicting claims on national output; and that excessive credit expansion serves mainly to accommodate the inertial inflation thereby originated in the real sector. Given this hypothesis, the paper employs a computable general equilibrium model to investigate four distinct sources of <b>structural</b> <b>inflation</b> for the Turkish economy: (i) the profit/rent inflation based on monopolistic mark-ups over prime costs; (ii) imported inflation due to the import-dependent structure of the domestic industry; (iii) cost-push and demand inflation due to urban wage claims; and (iv) inflation that results from the fiscal pressures of the government's budget deficits. The general equilibrium model is in the Keynesian tradition in determining the production level by aggregate demand constraints. Furthermore, it accommodates oligopolistic mark-up rules and working capital expenses for price determination, and nominal wage fixity to determine the level of employment. The general equilibrium analysis of the macro economy suggests that, over the analysed period, conflicting claims of various social classes on national output and conflicting rates of intersectoral accumulation warranted by competing producer groups have become important sources of disequilibria in the domestic economy; and that the distributional conflict among socio-economic classes had a direct impact on the formation of price movements. ...|$|E
