He {{is quoted as}} saying, [...] "let's see how this thing all turns out, rather than anticipate a problem that so far has not arisen in any significant way." [...] Until such a time, he supports allowing network owners to control what sites consumers view, saying, in May 2007, [...] "When you control the pipe you <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> profit from your investment".|$|E
2500|$|President Barack Obama {{announced}} on 9 May 2012, that [...] "I think same-sex couples <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married". Obama also supported the full repeal of DOMA, {{and called the}} state constitutional bans on same-sex marriage in California (2008) and North Carolina (2012) unnecessary. In 2011, the Obama Administration concluded that DOMA was unconstitutional and directed the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) to stop defending the law in court. Subsequently, Eric Cantor, Republican majority leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, announced that the House would defend DOMA. The law firm hired to represent the House soon withdrew from defending the law, requiring the House to retain replacement counsel.|$|E

On 21 May 2013, May voted in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, which legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales.|$|E

2500|$|Preventing {{stolen bases}} by {{throwing}} to second base or third base to allow an infielder to tag a baserunner attempting {{to reach the}} base. A catcher who {{is very good at}} preventing stolen bases is said to have a low stolen-base percentage; a poor one has many bases stolen while he catches. (A pitcher who is slow to deliver is often more at fault for stolen bases than the catcher is.) Ideally, a catcher <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the ball from his glove to that of the player covering second base in under two seconds. This is referred to as a catcher's [...] "pop time", the time elapsing between the popping sound of the pitch striking the catcher's mitt and the similar pop when the ball arrives at the glove of the fielder covering second base.|$|E
