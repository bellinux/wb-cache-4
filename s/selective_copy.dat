It is suggested that it is a <b>selective</b> <b>copy</b> of Turkic egen ~ igen (< erken), an indirective and/or emphatic rhetorical particle ('evidently', 'obviously', 'apparently', 'as it appears', 'it turns out that', 'indeed'), derived from er- 'to be' and used as part of the predicate core and/or as a postpredicate element to convey consenting or admitting answers...|$|E
40|$|Two {{intriguing}} {{properties of}} reduplicative affixes {{are that they}} are invariant in shape or weight and that their segmental makeup is dependent upon the base {{to which they are}} attached. Previous autosegmental explanations of shape- invariance and base- dependent melody adopt two mechanisms: i) a skeletal template to account for the consistency in weight and ii) a copying mechanism that transfers base segmental content into a reduplicative template (Marantz 1982, Broselow and McCarthy 1984, and Levin 1985). These accounts have since come under attack for a number of reasons. One major criticism concerns the unconstrained nature of templates; in, principle., any string of skeletal slots can be licensed as a template under these earlier accounts (Clements 1985, McCarthy and Prince 1986, 1987, and Steriade 1988). As a means of coping with this problem, McCarthy and Prince (1986, 1987) propose that reduplicative affixes be characterised by prosodically defined templates: i) core syllables (ad, ii) light syllables (σ(μ)), iii) heavy syllables (σ(μμ)), iv) syllables (σ), v) bimoraic feet (F(μμ)), vi) iambic feet (F(μμμ)), vii) disyllabic feet (F(σσ)), and viii) prosodic words. An important contribution of prosodic templates is that they establish prosodic constituency as a criterion for constraining templates, for a unit that does not correspond to a prosodic constituent can never be licenced as a reduplicative template. In addition, McCarthy and Prince (1986, 1987) exploit a copying mechanism. Copying can take two forms: i) an entire sequence of base segmental melody can be targeted for copying; or ii) a portion of it can be targeted for copying as long as that portion is prosodically defined or "circumscribed" (McCarthy and Prince 1990). In either case, copying is selective in that it excludes suprasegmental structures. Hence, I will refer to this model as <b>Selective</b> <b>Copy.</b> In contrast with <b>Selective</b> <b>Copy,</b> Steriade (1988) puts forward a different prosodic model of reduplication. Within her model, shape- invariance results from an interplay of weight and syllable markedness parameters. Among the weight parameters are: i) light syllables, ii) monosyllabic feet, iii) bimoraic feet, iv) disyllabic feet. These weight parameters differ from prosodic templates posited by <b>Selective</b> <b>Copy.</b> They are not templates that possess independent prosodic structures even though they are stated in terms of prosodic units that specify which prosodic constituent is targeted as the reduplicant. This conception of weight parameters forces a different copying apparatus. Copying must be exhaustive: it must target both the segmental melody and the prosodic structure of the base. This is critical; without the prosodic constituents of the base, weight parameters cannot select which unit of the copied base to retain as the reduplicant. In the following, I will refer to this model as Exhaustive Copy. This brief contrast demonstrates two radical differences between <b>Selective</b> <b>Copy</b> and Exhaustive Copy: i) templates vs. parameters and ii) selective vs. exhaustive copying. These differences impose a further contrast in expressing insertion of base - independent melody. Whereas insertion can make reference to the prosodic units of a template with <b>Selective</b> <b>Copy,</b> it cannot rely on parameters with Exhaustive Copy. Insertion can and must be defined by an existing prosodic structure of the base. This distinction becomes significant in examining Swati diminutive reduplication, which shows a base-independent vowel a in its reduplicant. What is important about this melody is that it is present only when a base cannot supply sufficient segmental content for a foot-sized reduplicant lingi-lingis 'resemble a little' vs. goba-gob 'bend a little'. The question addressed here is whether or not these two proposals can express a insertion. I demonstrate that a insertion cannot be formally stated by Exhaustive Copy. Crucial to the argument is that an insufficient base is lacking not only in segmental melody but also in prosodic constituency essential for defining the locus of insertion. Motivation for an insertion treatment takes two steps. First, internal evidence from passive formations suggests that i functions as the default vowel -not a. Second, this a behaves in Kikuyu like an architypical instance of "prespecification" in that it overrides any vowel in the base. As mentioned in footnote 4, Kikuyu and Swati are both members of the Bantu family. Moreover, reduplication as a diminutive marker is an important and widespread property of Bantu morphology (Meinhof 1932). This suggests that Swati a should be treated on a par with Kikuyu a since it cannot be filled in by default. The layout of this paper is as follows. Section 1 contrasts the two models of reduplication through examples from Tagalog. Section 2 applies <b>Selective</b> <b>Copy</b> to an account of Kikuyu and Swati reduplication. In particular, I demonstrate that Swati a requires an insertion treatment in consideration of both internal and external evidence. Section 3 spells out the argument against Exhaustive Copy from Swati a. In Section 4, I discuss some further implications of the templatic vs. parametric opposition for an overall theory of morphology. The critical point emerging from this discussion is that morphological processes such as Semitic roots and Japanese hypocoristics require access to templates; the parametric approach falls short on this score...|$|E
40|$|Published {{two years}} before Antonio de Nebrija' s splendid Diccionario latino-español, Alfonso Fernández de Palencia's Universal Vocabulario has not aroused among the critics the enthusiasm it deserves. This Spanish humanist's work has been {{frequently}} described as medieval. Furthermore, there is enough evidence to state unmistakably that Palencia's dictionary follows very closely Papias' Elementarium Doctrinae Durimentum. In fact, Palencia takes Papias' work as a starting point, whom he copies literally. But it is a reflexive and <b>selective</b> <b>copy,</b> {{not the kind of}} hurried plagiarism we are used to in lexicography. Palencia laboured over Papias' work until he turned his own Universal Vocabulario into the threshold of modern lexicography which starts definitely from Nebrija's dictionaries: a) As constrasted with other dictionaries of the same period, the Universal Vocabulario sometimes includes several meanings under a single entry. b) Palencia is different from other contemporary lexicographers because he tries to form small lexematic groupings. c) He resorts to drawings in order to illustrate the explanations given for the entries. The use of drawings reveals the pedagogical aim inspiring him in the planning of his work, rather than his unability to give definitions. This pedagogical aim is reflected in the many classical authors' quotations and examples included. All these features —except for the drawings which will not appear again until the XVth century with Francisco Rosal— {{can be found in the}} most successful and well-known dictionaries of the XVth and XVIth centuries: in Rodrigo Fernández de Santaella's Vocabularium ecclesiasticum (Sevilla, 1499) and in Diego Jiménez Arias' Lexicon ecclesiaticum (Salamanca, 1566). Therefore, the Universal Vocabulario arises in the history of Spanish lexicography as a perfect hinge between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, but also as the first link of a chain which goes without a break for centuries except for Nebrija, who steps out of line in points where his immediate predecessor had made important progress...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{defenses against}} confidentiality and integrity attacks on data following break-ins, or so-called intrusion resistant storage technologies. We investigate {{the problem of}} protecting secret data, assuming an attacker is inside a target network or has compromised a system. We give a definition of the problem area, and propose a solution, VAST, that uses large, structured files to improve the secure storage of valuable or secret data. Each secret has its multiple shares randomly distributed in an extremely large file. Random decoy shares {{and the lack of}} usable identification information prevent <b>selective</b> <b>copying</b> or analysis of the file. No single part of the file yields useful information in isolation from the rest. The file’s size and structure therefore present an enormous additional hurdle to attackers attempting to transfer, steal or analyze the data. The system also has the remarkable property of healing itself after malicious corruption, thereby preserving both the confidentiality and integrity of the data. ...|$|R
40|$|Paper number: 1568952365 Abstract—Packet {{classification}} {{by analyzing}} the traffic header information is an essential task of network processors. To efficiently store, retrieve and update information, key-based data accessing algorithms such as hashing are usually used to improve the processing performance. In this paper, we propose the hybrid open hash, a composite algorithm that combines open addressing hash tables with the temporal responsiveness of incremental garbage collection. By dynamically switching between a novel table with incremental construction via <b>selective</b> <b>copying</b> of used entries, and an aged table with incremental cleaning via emptying of deleted entries, this algorithm solves the structural problem of conventional open hashing due to remnants left by deleted keys. Thus, it increases the data accessing speed. We also implement and compare our algorithm with Brutil, the latest proposed hashing mechanism designed for real-time embedded systems, from the concurrency issue of multithreading to the performance simulation by taking the real traffic information to construct hashed keys. Our results show that hybrid open hash has better performance. Several possible enhancement approaches are also discussed to improve the performance further.

40|$|This {{research}} was {{supported by a grant from}} The John Templeton Foundation. Background. Social learning is potentially advantageous, but evolutionary theory predicts that (i) its benefits may be self-limiting because social learning can lead to information parasitism, and (ii) these limitations can be mitigated via forms of <b>selective</b> <b>copying.</b> However, these findings arise from a functional approach in which learning mechanisms are not specified, and which assumes that social learning avoids the costs of asocial learning but does not produce information about the environment. Whether these findings generalize to all kinds of social learning remains to be established. Using a detailed multi-scale evolutionary model, we investigate the payoffs and information production processes of specific social learning mechanisms (including local enhancement, stimulus enhancement and observational learning) and their evolutionary consequences in the context of skill learning in foraging groups. Results. We find that local enhancement does not benefit foraging success, but could evolve as a side-effect of grouping. In contrast, stimulus enhancement and observational learning can be beneficial across a wide range of environmental conditions because they generate opportunities for new learning outcomes. Conclusions. In contrast to much existing theory, we find that the functional outcomes of social learning are mechanism specific. Social learning nearly always produces information about the environment, and does not always avoid the costs of asocial learning or support information parasitism. Our study supports work emphasizing the value of incorporating mechanistic detail in functional analyses. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|As the {{gap between}} {{processor}} and memory continues to grow Memory performance becomes a key performance bottleneck for many applications. Compilers therefore increasingly seek to modify an application’s data layout to improve cache locality and cache reuse. Whole program Structure Layout [WPSL] transformations can significantly increase the spatial locality of data and reduce the runtime of programs that use link-based data structures, by increasing the cache line utilization. However, in production compilers WPSL transformations do not realize the entire performance potential possible due {{to a number of}} factors. Structure layout decisions {{made on the basis of}} whole program aggregated affinity/hotness of structure fields, can be sub optimal for local code regions. WPSL is also restricted in applicability in production compilers for type unsafe languages like C/C++ due to the extensive legality checks and field sensitive pointer analysis required over the entire application. In order to overcome the issues associated with WPSL, we propose Region Based Structure Layout (RBSL) optimization framework, using <b>selective</b> data <b>copying.</b> We describe our RBSL framework, implemented in the production compiler for C/C++ on HP-UX IA- 64.

40|$|AbstractFor the seaward harbour {{extension}} of the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, approximately 220 million m 3 sand was extracted between 2009 and 2013. In order to decrease the surface area of direct impact, the authorities permitted deep sand extraction, down to 20  m below the seabed. Biological and physical impacts of large-scale and deep sand extraction are still being investigated and largely unknown. For this reason, we investigated the colonization of demersal fish in a deep sand extraction site. Two sandbars were artificially created by <b>selective</b> dredging, <b>copying</b> naturally occurring meso-scale bedforms to increase habitat heterogeneity and increasing post-dredging benthic and demersal fish species richness and biomass. Significant differences in demersal fish species assemblages in the sand extraction site were associated with variables such as water depth, median grain size, fraction of very fine sand, biomass of white furrow shell (Abra alba) and time after the cessation of sand extraction. Large quantities of undigested crushed white furrow shell fragments were found in all stomachs and intestines of plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), indicating {{that it is an}} important prey item. One and two years after cessation, a significant 20 -fold increase in demersal fish biomass was observed in deep parts of the extraction site. In the troughs of a landscaped sandbar however, a significant drop in biomass down to reference levels and a significant change in species assemblage was observed two years after cessation. The fish assemblage at the crests of the sandbars differed significantly from the troughs with tub gurnard (Chelidonichthys lucerna) being a Dufrêne-Legendre indicator species of the crests. This is a first indication of the applicability of landscaping techniques to induce heterogeneity of the seabed although it remains difficult to draw a strong conclusion due the lack of replication in the experiment. A new ecological equilibrium is not reached after 2 years since biotic and abiotic variables are still adapting. To understand the final impact of deep and large-scale sand extraction on demersal fish, we recommend monitoring for a longer period, at least for a period of six years or even longer...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMost {{plant species}} are recent or ancient polyploids (displaying {{at least one}} round of genome {{duplication}} in their history). Cultivated species (e. g. wheat, cotton, canola, sugarcane, coffee) and invasive species are often relatively recent polyploids, and frequently of hybrid origin (i. e. allopolyploids). Despite the genetic bottleneck occurring during the allopolyploid speciation process, the formation of such species from two divergent lineages leads to fixed heterozygosity decisive to their success. New phenotypes and new niche occupation are usually associated with this mode of speciation, {{as a result of}} both genomic rearrangements and gene expression changes of different magnitudes depending on the different polyploid species investigated. These gene expression changes affecting newly formed polyploid species may result from various, interconnected mechanisms, including (i) functional interactions between the homoeologous copies and between their products, that are reunited in the same nucleus and cell; (ii) the fate of duplicated <b>copies,</b> <b>selective</b> pressure on one of the parental copy being released which could lead to gene loss, pseudogenization, or alternatively, to subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization; and (iii) epigenetic landscape changes that in turn affect gene expression. As one of the interrelated processes leading to epigenetic regulation of gene expression, the DNA methylation status of newly formed species appears to be consistently affected following both hybridization and genome doubling. In this issue, Verhoeven et al. have investigated the fate of DNA methylation patterns that could affect naturally occurring new asexual triploid lineages of dandelions. As a result of such a ploidy level change, the authors demonstrate stably transmitted DNA methylation changes leading to unique DNA methylation patterns in each newly formed lineage. Most studies published to date on plant DNA methylation polymorphism were performed using restriction enzymes sensitive to methylation. Recently, new high-throughput methods were made available, thanks to the development of ‘next-generation sequencing' techniques. The combination of these methods offers powerful and promising tools to investigate epigenetic variation in both model and non-model systems...|$|R
