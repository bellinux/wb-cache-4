Factors to consider in the timing of fertilizer application include, the level of information available, input cost, input efficiency, and application cost. The key objective of this thesis is to determine the financial impact of switching to spring N application from fall N application.

40|$|El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) {{has been}} linked to climate {{anomalies}} throughout the world. This paper presents an overview of the relationship between ENSO and rainfall, drought and streamflow in Australia. The teleconnection between ENSO and the hydroclimate of Australia is investigated using the empirical method of Ropelewski and Halpert and the potential for forecasting the hydroclimate variables are investigated by assessing the lag correlations between rainfall and streamflow and the indicators of ENSO several months earlier. The analyses show that dry conditions in Australia tend to be associated with El Nino. The link between rainfall and streamflow and ENSO is statistically significant in most parts of Australia, but it is not sufficiently strong to consistently predict rainfall and streamflow accurately. The teleconnection is stronger {{in the latter part of}} the year, and the analyses suggest that the indicators of ENSO can be used with some success to <b>forecast</b> <b>spring</b> rainfall in eastern Australia and summer rainfall in north-east Australia several months in advance.

In this study, long-term <b>forecasting</b> of Victorian <b>spring</b> rainfall has been investigated using lagged El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) indices using multiple regression analysis. Three stations of Buchan (east VIC), Malmsbury (Central VIC) and Kaniva (West VIC) were chosen as case study. Rainfall was classified according to El Nino, La Nina and Neutral years of ENSO, and also positive and negative years of IOD. It was discovered that categorizing rainfalls based on the years of ENSO and IOD do not have significant effect on its relationship with these climate modes. It was also found that the Pearson correlation coefficient between ENSO and Buchan in east Victoria is very weak; for Malmsbury and Kaniva ENSO indicators are showing higher correlations compared to Buchan. DMI effect is stronger in these two regions as well.

The NL-BAM {{was developed}} by a multidisciplinary team and through the cooperation of the people from the Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics (IBED) and the Informatics Institute of the University of Amsterdam, the Royal Netherlands Air Force and SOVON, the Dutch Centre for field Ornithology. The NL-BAM is accessible to the general public on the Internet at [URL] The website and models are divided into two modules, 'migration prediction' and 'spatial distribution'. The migration module of the NL-BAM is a dynamic model and predicts the density of migrants during the day and at night for 3 consecutive days based on real-time and/or forecasted meteorological data. During the migration season, migration forecasts are updated daily by members of the RNLAF. Predictions are presented in figures on the NL-BAM website. The autumn nocturnal forecasts are based on three data-driven models: a log-linear regression model, a conceptual model and a neural network model. The <b>spring</b> <b>forecasts</b> include a log-linear regression model and a neural network model. Diurnal forecasts are based on nocturnal forecasts by the log-linear relationship between nocturnal and diurnal migration intensities. The spatial distribution module includes spatial density maps of the 62 bird species selected as most relevant for flight safety in the Netherlands in bi-weekly intervals, four time periods per day and at five altitude layers. This module is based on historic field observations and represents the density distribution expected in average circumstances. The key species were selected based on criteria such as total number of birdstrikes, number of damaging birdstrikes, availability of data, mass, behaviour of birds, expert knowledge on species and conservation importance. The spatial distribution of each species was modelled in relation to environmental conditions using a combination of regression models, spatial statistics and expert knowledge. Furthermore, the altitude distribution of several species of birds was modelled in relation to meteorological conditions. Expert knowledge and additional sources were used to complete information on the altitude distribution, temporal activity (daily), annual abundance and flight activity. The public access website includes composite maps of mass and separately for number of birds/km 2 for each time of year, time of day and altitude combination (480 combinations). An authorized access page, accessible only by team members, also includes individual maps for each species as well as a summary table including total numbers of the top 10 most abundant species per region for each time of year, time of day, altitude combinations.

Nonetheless, clear association between separate or combined large-scale climate predictors and South Australian spring rainfall is yet to be established. Past studies showed that maximum rainfall predictability was only 20 % considering isolated/individual effects of ENSO and SAM predictors in this region.

Nitrogen fertiliser requirements in dry (i. e. low spring-summer rainfall) and wet (i. e. high spring-summer rainfall) years for ratoon sugarcane crops grown on the Bulgun series soil were investigated in a simulation study. As the majority of nitrogen fertiliser is typically applied to ratoon sugarcane crops during <b>spring,</b> seasonal climate <b>forecasting</b> indices based on sea surface temperature anomalies in the central equatorial Pacific Ocean were also investigated for their utility to predict nitrogen fertiliser requirements with sufficient lead-time. The simulation study identified nitrogen fertiliser requirements are on average, 25...|$|R
40|$|Estonia has {{successfully}} mastered {{the transition from}} a planned to a market economy. It has established a rather liberal economic regime, flexible labour markets and a business-friendly environment. At the same time, it has achieved a high degree of macroeconomic stability, supported by a sound fiscal policy. Estonia joined ERM II in June 2004, maintaining its currency board arrangement as a unilateral commitment. Average growth between 2000 and 2004 was 6. 5 % per year, while estimated potential growth is even higher. The main macroeconomic imbalance is a high external deficit. Although this largely reflects strong investment needs in the catching-up process, public savings will continue to be required as an important counterweight to low and declining household savings. This article looks at the main underlying factors driving Estonia’s external imbalance and provides some reflections on sustainability issues, {{as well as on the}} role of fiscal policy. It concludes that Estonia’s external deficit does not reflect fundamental imbalances that would require drastic policy reversals, but that it does nevertheless increase the economy’s potential vulnerability to unfavourable external developments. A rapid expansion of the external deficit [...] . After hovering around 5 % of GDP in 2000 and 2001, Estonia’s external account deficit 1 surged to nearly 10 % of GDP in 2002. In 2003, it peaked at 12. 7 % of GDP, and remained high at 11. 8 % of GDP in 2004. The trade deficit weakened to over 17 % of GDP both in 2003 and 2004. This was partly compensated by an increasing surplus on the services balance, while the deficit on the income balance kept rising. A gradual narrowing of Estonia’s external account deficit has been forecast for some time, and finally appears to have set in late 2004, primarily through the trade balance, as exports picked up strongly. The Commission services <b>spring</b> 2005 <b>forecast</b> projects a reduction of the external deficit to below 10 % of GDP by 2006, whereas recent developments during the first quarter of 2005 suggest a more rapid correction...|$|R
40|$|On a {{seasonal}} time scale, forecast centers of National Weather Service produce streamflow forecasts via a method called Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP). In {{conjunction with the}} physically-based Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model (SAC-SMA), ESP uses historical weather sequences for the forecasting period starting from model 2 ̆ 7 s current initial conditions, to produce ensemble streamflow. There are two major drawbacks of this method|(i) the ensembles are limited {{to the length of}} historical record thereby producing limited variability and (ii) incorporating seasonal climate forecasts such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is done by selecting a subset of historical sequences which further reduces the variability of streamflow forecasts. The need for alleviating these drawbacks motivates the proposed research. To this end, this research effort has two components (i) an improved multi-site stochastic weather generator and (ii) coupling it to the SAC-SMA model for ensemble streamflow forecasting. We enhanced the traditional K-nearest neighbor semi-parametric stochastic weather generator (SWG). In SWG the daily precipitation state (wet or dry) is modeled as a Markov Chain and the weather vector on a given day is simulated conditioned on the previous day 2 ̆ 7 s precipitation state and weather vector and current day 2 ̆ 7 s precipitation state. A K-nearest neighbor resampling approach is used to simulate from the conditional probability density function. Our improvements to this stochastic generator include (i) clustering the locations into climatologically homogeneous regions and applying the weather generator separately for each region and jointly to better capture the spatial heterogeneity and, (ii) modifying the resampling approach to incorporate probabilistic seasonal climate forecast. We tested this enhanced weather generator by applying it to daily weather sequences at 66 locations in the San Juan River Basin. The proposed method generates a rich variety of weather sequences capturing the distributional properties at all the locations and the spatial dependence. It also simulates consistent weather sequences conditioned on seasonal climate forecasts. The multi-site stochastic weather generator was coupled with the SAC-SMA model (WGESP) within NWS 2 ̆ 7 s new Community Hydrologic Prediction System (CHPS) to produce ensemble streamflow <b>forecast.</b> <b>Spring</b> season ensemble <b>forecasts</b> at several lead times from Nov through Apr for the period 19812010 were made from WG-ESP and the traditional ESP for the San Juan River Basin. We show that the weather generator based ensemble produces a rich variability in the flows including extremes and a higher skill at long lead times. Especially, skill in wet year forecast was found to be higher than dry years. The flexible and robust framework provides many opportunities to further improve the ESP system in enabling increased skills at longer lead times that will be of immense help to water resources managers...|$|R
