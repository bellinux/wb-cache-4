40|$|A {{sensible}} epistemologist {{may not see}} how {{she could}} know that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a Brain In a Vat (BIV); but she doesn’t panic. She sticks with her empirical beliefs, and as that requires, believes that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a BIV. (<b>She</b> does not inferentially base her belief that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a BIV on her empirical knowledge—she rejects that ‘Moorean’ response to skepticism.) Drawing on the psychological literature on metacognition, I describe a mechanism that’s plausibly responsible for a sensible epistemologist coming to believe <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a BIV. I propose she thereby knows that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a BIV. The particular belief-forming mechanism employed explains why she overlooks this account of how <b>she</b> knows <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a BIV, making it seem {{that there is no}} way for her to know it. I argue this proposal satisfactorily resolves the skeptical puzzle...|$|R
