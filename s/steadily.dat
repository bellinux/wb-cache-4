5|$|The Somerton parish had a {{population}} of 4,706 as of 2002. In the 1801 census {{the population of the}} town was 1,145 and {{the first half of the}} 19th century saw strong growth (reflecting that seen elsewhere in England during this period), with the population rising to 2,140 in 1851. It however then began to drop, starting with a significant drop to 1,917 by the 1861 census. The population <b>steadily</b> fell until 1921, before <b>steadily</b> rising thereafter. It was not until 1961 that the population of Somerton had risen above its former population of 1851. The population has since continued to <b>steadily</b> increase.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s the British <b>steadily</b> {{expanded}} {{control over}} the South Sudan. The Deputy governor of Mongalla, Major R.G.C. Brock, estimated that he had added 50,000 Toposa and related people to {{the eastern half of}} his province, a somewhat inflated figure.|$|E

5|$|On August 25, a {{tropical}} wave emerged {{off the coast}} of Africa. Tracking westward, the wave developed convection over its center, and conducive conditions allowed it to develop further. The system passed through the Cape Verde islands later that day as convection <b>steadily</b> weakened. Early on August 27, convection again increased and consolidated near the center, and later that day the wave developed into Tropical Depression Ten while located 420miles (675km) west of the Cape Verde islands. Moving westward into an area of warm waters and low vertical shear, the depression <b>steadily</b> intensified, and was named Tropical Storm Fabian on August 28 as convection increased and banding features became more prominent.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of Tropical Storm Juliette {{can be traced}} back to a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on September12. After interacting with a secondary wave over the central Atlantic a few days later, it entered the eastern Caribbean, becoming <b>steadily</b> better defined. Convective activity was enhanced as the wave passed into the West Caribbean on September22 and it moved inland over Central American shortly thereafter. A broad area of low pressure formed along the wave axis on September27 and convection <b>steadily</b> increased; around 0000UTC on September19, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Juliette. Turning northwest as a result of an upper-level trough, the system attained its peak with winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997mb (hPa; 29.44inHg) at 1200UTC on September30. Strong wind shear began to affect the storm thereafter, causing it to <b>steadily</b> weaken to tropical depression strength by 0000UTC on October2. Twelve hours later, the system degenerated into a remnant low. The low meandered several hundred miles off the coast of Baja California before degenerating into a trough on October5.|$|E

5|$|While the 24th Infantry Division was {{fighting}} on the Korean western front, the 5th and 12th North Korean Infantry Divisions advanced <b>steadily</b> on the eastern front. The North Korean army, 89,000men strong, had advanced into South Korea in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise, resulting in a complete rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and it was unprepared for war. Numerically superior, North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving <b>steadily</b> south.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} gradually {{developed over the}} extreme southeastern Caribbean Sea on November 1. It moved slowly westward and <b>steadily</b> organized. By November 4, the system stalled to the north of Curaçao, which was followed by a turn to the northeast. Convection slowly organized as a surface circulation formed, and on November 5 the system developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen. Initially weak with only 20mph (32km/h) winds, the depression <b>steadily</b> organized as it moved northeastward, and a Reconnaissance Aircraft mission confirmed the existence of the cyclone on November 6 as it was located midway between Puerto Rico and the Netherlands Antilles. Late on the 6th, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Klaus while located a short distance south of Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} west coast of Africa and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on September11. After tracking westward for five days, the wave entered the Caribbean Sea on September16. Convection <b>steadily</b> increased in both coverage and intensity, and by September19, the system reached the southwestern Caribbean Sea. Satellite imagery and surface observations indicated that Tropical Depression Nine formed at 1800UTC on September19, while located 50miles (80km) north-northwest of San Andres Island.|$|E

Bicyclists accounted for 2 percent of all traffic deaths in 2014.|$|E
5|$|As the Great War progressed, war {{exhaustion}} in Germany grew. The first {{strikes in}} the country {{since the start of}} the war broke out in 1915, <b>steadily</b> increasing in frequency and magnitude. The unions' role as troubleshooter between the employers and the workers soon led to conflict between the membership and union officials, and the Free Trade Unions <b>steadily</b> lost members. Correspondingly, the Reichstag faction of the SPD split over continued support for the war. The 1917 February Revolution in Russia was seen by the FVdG as an expression of the people's desire for peace. The syndicalists paid special attention to the role the general strike (which they had been advocating for years) played in the revolution. They were unable to comment on the October Revolution as the Rundschreiben had been banned by the time it broke out.|$|E
5|$|At the settlement, Hudson {{and his men}} built a {{home and}} the township's {{population}} increased <b>steadily</b> {{over the next few}} decades.

In 1805, Lambert's gaol closed. By this time, he weighed , and had become the heaviest authenticated person up to that point in recorded history. Unemployable and sensitive about his bulk, Lambert became a recluse.|$|E
5|$|Because of its <b>steadily</b> declining sales {{attributed}} {{to the rise of}} online alternative media and social media, the newspaper has been going through a downsizing for several years, offering buyouts to workers and cutting expenses, in common with a general trend among print news media.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{receipts}} {{were initially}} insufficient {{to cover the}} six per cent dividend on the £5,697 that the Conservators had invested, they added the difference to the capital, so that the debt <b>steadily</b> increased.

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} surge in coal use which {{accompanied}} the Industrial Revolution, energy consumption has <b>steadily</b> transitioned from wood and biomass to fossil fuels. The early development of solar technologies starting in the 1860s was driven by an expectation that coal would soon become scarce. However, development of solar technologies stagnated in the early 20thcentury {{in the face of}} the increasing availability, economy, and utility of coal and petroleum.|$|E

Over an eight-year period, Bush's once-high approval ratings <b>steadily</b> declined, while his disapproval numbers increased significantly. In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession.|$|E
5|$|By August30, strong outflow {{developed}} around Luis despite convection remaining {{displaced from}} the low pressure center. Once the shear began to relent, shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the center, allowing the storm to intensify. Around 1800UTC that day, Luis attained Category1 hurricane status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; however, operationally Luis was not upgraded to a hurricane until 0900UTC on August31. The newly upgraded hurricane <b>steadily</b> intensified as banding features developed around {{the periphery of the}} cyclone. By the morning of August31, cold cloud tops surrounded a developing eye. Around this time, Luis was located due south of the area of high pressure and tracking <b>steadily</b> towards the west-northwest. Further development resulted in the appearance of a ragged eye appearing on visible satellite images. Winds within the eyewall were estimated at 100mph (155km/h), making Luis a low-end Category2 hurricane. Later that day, the storm became increasingly organized, with a symmetrical structure and a well-defined center. The NHC forecast the hurricane to peak as a Category3 hurricane in 36hours before interacting with Hurricane Iris and Tropical Storm Karen.|$|E
