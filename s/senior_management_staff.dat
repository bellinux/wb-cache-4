2500|$|In the {{marketing}} field, seeding {{is considered the}} process of allocating marketing to specific customers, or groups of customers, in order to stimulate the internal dynamics of the market, enhance the diffusion process and encourage faster adoption of the product throughout the entire population. In a marketing seeding program, a company offers some sort of promotion (free product, discounts, service trials, etc.) to a niche group of people with the intention that this would stimulate WOM. An early example of a seeding trial was during the development of Post-it notes, produced by 3M. In 1977, secretaries to <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>staff</b> throughout the United States were sent packs of Post-its and invited to suggest possible uses for them. They soon {{found them to be}} extremely useful and became [...] "brand champions" [...] for the product, an early example of viral marketing. Companies that have used seeding trials include Procter & Gamble, Microsoft, Hasbro, Google, Unilever, Pepsi, Coke, Ford, DreamWorks SKG, EMI, Sony, and Siemens.|$|E
2500|$|Constitutionally {{the monarch}} is {{entitled}} to compensation from the annual state budget {{for the maintenance of}} his family and household administration, and freely distributes these funds in accordance with the laws. According to the Royal Household, [...] "he purpose of these resources is to ensure that the Head of State may carry out his tasks with the independence which is inherent to his constitutional functions, as well as with due effectiveness and dignity". The annual budget pays the remunerations for <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> <b>staff,</b> management staff and career civil servants, other minor staffing positions, and for general office expenses. The Head of Household, Secretary General, and other management staff salaries must be comparable to other administration ministers within the government, though in no way do they form part of the government or administration. As such, the management staff experience increases, decreases, or freezes to their pay in accordance with the fluctuations of government minister salaries. Additionally, the annual budget pays for the maintenance and expenses of senior {{members of the royal family}} who undertake royal duties; which includes grocery, clothing, and toiletries allotments. [...] The budget approved by the Cortes for 2010 was just under 7.4 million euros, a budget only slightly larger than that spent on the Luxembourg monarchy. In 2011 the king addressed the perennial critique of the monarchy; that of how the annual budget awarded to the monarchy and royal household is spent. The report revealed that only 9.6% of the 8.4 million euros budgeted that year for the monarchy are paid to royal family members as 'salaries and representative duties', with the difference marked for royal household operational expenses such as household staff salaries, various insurance premiums and liabilities, services, [...] and 'supplementals' such as overhead. In 2012, the monarchy volunteered an additional 7% pay-cut in solidarity with government officials.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} growing concern about the ability of {{voluntary}} boards to govern public and voluntary organisations effectively. This has led to a burgeoning prescriptive literature that attempts to set out the responsibilities, roles and tasks of governing bodies. Yet there is often a large gap between these prescriptions and the reality of governance as revealed by empirical studies. This study aimed to help reduce that gap by examining in detail the working of boards and the constraints and dilemmas they face. The research examined how boards select and develop board members, the relationship between boards and <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> or <b>staff,</b> and what boards contribute to their organisations. Based on these findings, the paper sets out some recommendations for improving the value of voluntary boards...|$|R
50|$|In {{the wake}} of a series of layoffs in June 2009, Faust was criticized for refusing to accept a pay cut in an effort to save jobs.

Reports on Faust's salary differ: The Boston Globe reports that Faust made $775,043 in the 2007-2008 school year, while the Harvard Crimson reported that Faust made $693,739 in salary and benefits for the 2008-2009 fiscal year. In early 2009, the Harvard Corporation approved salary freezes for the president, deans, <b>senior</b> officers, <b>management</b> <b>staff,</b> and faculty, and offered an early retirement program.

What they did report as being a vital source of support, however, was the establishment of informal learning and support networks made up of other individuals who were also Associate Deans.

40|$|The Auckland {{construction}} sector is currently {{faced with a}} skills shortage which {{has the potential to}} impede the industry’s further development. The research focused on the potential of carpentry apprenticeship programmes to assist with this shortage, and evaluated the cost-benefit relationship of such apprenticeships within medium/large scale commercial construction companies in the Auckland {{construction sector}}, to determine the value to employers of this form of vocational training. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> level <b>staff</b> of established construction companies within the Auckland sector, to explore employers’ perceptions of the value of apprenticeship training to employers. In addition, a quantitative analysis of data provided by the participating companies was carried out, to identify the overall cost of an apprentice to the employer over the vocational training period. Responses suggested growing concern within the industry about the skills shortage currently facing Auckland construction. Whilst the findings indicated an overall financial cost to employers during the four year training period, the respondents agreed that the practical benefits to the company and to the industry as a whole outweighed any financial implications. Apprenticeship training could therefore mitigate future risk by focusing on developing the knowledge capital of apprentice carpenters within the industry...|$|R

The stakeholders studied in each school are the governors (directors {{in the case of the}} international school), the <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> team, teachers, students and parents. The SMT were interviewed, surveys were adopted for the other stakeholders.;The literature review finds that stakeholder views are not a focus of many school effectiveness and improvement studies. Governors and <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> team (SMT) views on school improvement are seldom investigated. Studies that involve the full range of stakeholders are rarely seen.;The results of the stakeholder surveys at the two schools revealed common experiences and contrasts between schools and between stakeholders. At both schools, governors are noted as being followers and do not make the school accountable, the SMTs revealed lack of cohesion and the head and principal did not appear to be aware of the problems. Problems between the <b>senior</b> <b>management</b> and <b>staff</b> are also clearly portrayed by both teachers and senior staff.;Whereas similarities in school improvement issues between the stakeholders of a school were common, the priorities for improvement were different. What parents and students perceived as priority areas did not agree with other stakeholder priorities. This pattern was replicated in both schools.;The research finds that some problems appear to be hidden from inspections. The accuracy of Ofsted inspection report statements that declare the two schools as good is, therefore, questioned. The study concludes by proposing a new definition for a good school. It responds to the findings in the literature review by adding a stakeholder school. It responds to the findings in the literature review by adding a stakeholder specific school effectiveness list to contrast existing ones (for example, Sammons et al 1995) and provides a process model for school improvement with stakeholders at its centre...|$|R
