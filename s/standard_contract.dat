These scripts led to Carter being associated with contemporary youth comedy at the studio, and although he enjoyed the work he felt that his real strengths and interests lay in serious drama instead.|$|E
5|$|The post {{system was}} the {{cornerstone}} of Abir's commercial activity. Each post was run by one or two European agents to oversee local operations. The salary for an agent was 1,800 fr per year, sometimes increasing to 2,100 fr in the second year, and the <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> period was three years. Agents also received 60 fr of trade goods each month with which to buy their food. Despite the low wages the 2% commission that each agent received on rubber production made {{up the majority of}} the agents' pay, for example the agent at Bongandanga received 16,800 fr in commission in 1903. As a result, there were many applicants for each post and agents were hired with the expectation that they would increase production by 0.5–3 tons per month. This was implemented by extending the post to include more villages or increasing the quotas expected from the villagers, often indirectly forcing women and children to harvest the rubber as well. If production fell below the quota agents made up the shortfall in lost profits to the company from their pay. Each post consisted of a residence for the agent, barracks for armed sentries and sheds for rubber drying and storage, all built using labour conscripted from the villagers. A typical post employed ten African workmen to sort and dry the rubber, seven servants for the agent and thirty canoemen for local river transport. These were paid around 36.5 fr per year in goods, commonly 5kg of salt, one blanket, five machetes and trade goods to the value of 6.35 fr. The post system was managed by the Director of Congo Operations at the central office in Basankusu. He was assisted in his job of keeping production up and expenses down by the only Free State employee in the concession, the commander of the police. The police commander was in charge of suppressing revolts and punishing villages which dropped below the quota. He had access to a large force of men and river steamers which was stationed at Basankusu and could redeploy quickly to the site of large scale rebellions. Effective police commanders would receive bonuses paid for by Abir.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of strong reciprocity implies that systems developed based purely on material self-interest may be missing important motivators in the marketplace. This section gives {{two examples of}} possible implications. One area of application is {{in the design of}} incentive schemes. For example, <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> theory has difficulty dealing with the degree of incompleteness in contracts and the lack of use of performance measures, even when they are cheap to implement. Strong reciprocity and models based on it suggest that this can be explained by people's willingness to act fairly, even when it is against their material self-interest. Experimental results suggest that this is indeed the case, with participants preferring less complete contracts, and workers willing to contribute a fair amount beyond what would be in their own self-interest.|$|E
25|$|The {{ruling was}} based around seven issues. The panel {{declared}} that Keegan had been misled {{to believe he}} had the final decision on player transfers, and was never explicitly told in writing, his contract, or word of mouth {{that he did not}} or that his role would see him essentially report to others. Given the generally understood role of a Premiership manager, the panel agreed he could reasonably expect {{that this was not a}} factor. The club's signing of González meant that they had violated his employment contract, which amounted to constructive dismissal. While González was the main issue in the panel final decision, the club's alleged mistreatment of Keegan, claiming they were in a position to sack him should he have not agreed to the terms they offered him, as well as his decision to remain at the club till the 4 September instead of resigning on 1 September, allowing the club to reach a compromise, led to the panel ruling in Keegan's favour. Keegan was awarded £2million (plus interest accrued) according to severance clauses in his contract, which the club never paid him after his departure. Claims for more were turned down on the basis that the <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> severance clauses covered constructive dismissal, however he happily stated afterwards that the purpose of his claim had been to restore his reputation, and was delighted with the outcome, allowing him to move forward.|$|E

2500|$|The company {{recommended}} to its customers to invest cash holdings in a {{money market fund}} that was an affiliate of the Reserve Primary Fund and the fund gained approximately $1 billion in assets {{as a result of}} such marketing by the company. The company received commissions from the fund for steering customers. In September 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, {{as a result of its}} holdings in securities of Lehman Brothers, the fund was forced to break the buck and $1 billion in cash equivalents of TD Ameritrade clients were frozen. The company was accused of having a conflict of interest as a result of commissions that it received, for having poor marketing ethics, and for misrepresenting the safety of the investment. Fredric Tomczyk, President of the company, argued that the contract with the Reserve Fund was a <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> and that [...] "an investment firm has to make money in some way." [...] The company was named in class action lawsuits by its customers and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into its marketing practices. In 2008, the company agreed to reimburse its customers for up to a 3% loss in the Reserve Primary Fund, or up to $50 million. In 2011, the company settled the SEC case and agreed to pay 1.2¢ per share of the Reserve Yield Plus Fund that was held by its customers, or $10 million in total. The Reserve Yield Plus made its final distribution in 2016 and investors received 97 to 98 cents on the dollar in addition to compensation from TD Ameritrade.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to compare}} South African law on <b>standard</b> form <b>contracts</b> against the corresponding German law. Thus, the responses of both legal systems to the special situation occurring in cases of <b>standard</b> form <b>contracts</b> will be compared and evaluated. Thereby, {{the focus of this}} dissertation is to determine whether South African law on <b>standard</b> form <b>contracts</b> provides adequate protection for the submitting party. German law on <b>standard</b> form <b>contracts</b> provides the basis and outline against which South African law will be critically evaluated. German law was selected for this task, as {{it was one of the}} first legal systems, which enacted legislation, and addresses the issue systematically. It should be noted that this dissertation does not aim to evaluate German law on <b>standard</b> form <b>contracts.</b> In the first part of this dissertation I will provide a brief definition of the notion of freedom of contract and consumer protection. I will then proceed to highlight the relevance of <b>standard</b> form <b>contracts</b> in modern society and outline the problems associated with such contracts. This will be followed by a discussion of whether <b>standard</b> form <b>contracts</b> can be considered as classical contracts. In the second part of this dissertation I will outline the law on <b>standard</b> form <b>contracts</b> in both jurisdictions. Concerning the German law, I will give a brief overview of what the relevant provisions state. Concerning South African law, I will briefly illustrate what the relevant common law appears to be without going into far too much depth. Such outlines of the applicable laws are necessary in order to acquaint the reader with some of the important themes that this dissertation will discuss in detail. In part three the actual comparison and evaluation will follow. The comparison will include a detailed illustration of the law on <b>standard</b> form <b>contracts</b> in both jurisdictions. Thereby, some repetition in regard to the applicable law cannot be avoided. Thereafter, the evaluation will more specifically investigate whether South African law is effective in achieving its aims and whether South Africa should introduce legislation on <b>standard</b> form <b>contract</b> terms...|$|R

We experiment with {{four types of}} <b>contracts</b> (<b>standard</b> debt <b>contract,</b> outside equity, non-monotonic contract, full-subsidy contract) that differ {{in the structure of}} investor repayment and, therefore, in the incentives for entrepreneurial effort provision. Theoretically the replacement of a <b>standard</b> debt <b>contract</b> by a repayment-equivalent non-monotonic contract reduces effort distortions and increases efficiency. We test this non-monotonic-contracts hypothesis in the laboratory as well. Our results reveal that the incentive effects of funding contracts need to be experienced before they reect in observed behavior. With sufficient experience observed behavior is consistent with the theoretical predictions and supports the non-monotonic-contracts hypothesis: we find that the replacement of a <b>standard</b> debt <b>contract</b> by a repayment-neutral non-monotonic contract increases entrepreneurial income by 170 % and total surplus by 30 % in our setting. hidden information, funding <b>contracts,</b> incentives, experiment, <b>standard</b> debt <b>contract,</b> non-monotonic contract...|$|R
