5|$|The Cunard White Star Line's RMS Queen Elizabeth {{was named}} after her. She {{launched}} the ship on 27 September 1938 in Clydebank, Scotland. Supposedly, the liner started to slide into the water before Elizabeth could officially launch her, and acting sharply, she managed to smash a bottle of Australian red over the liner's bow just before it <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> reach. In 1954, Queen Elizabeth sailed to New York on her namesake.|$|E
5|$|Problems on the backstraight {{had been}} mostly {{rectified}} although a wet track {{surface in the}} first and fourth turns appeared caused by water coming from under the grandstands. Race officials deliberated {{on the morning of the}} race before declaring the track safe following the completion of repairs. The drivers took to the track at 11:15a.m local time for a ten-minute practice session. Carpentier set the fastest time with a lap of 27.075 seconds; Franchitti was second and Jimmy Vasser rounded out the session's top three drivers. A second session, lasting 90 minutes, began at 12:20p.m. local time. Kanaan recorded the session's fastest lap with a time of 24.719 seconds, ahead of Bräck in second and Tracy third. Three yellow caution flags were shown: the first was for Max Papis who cut his right-rear tyre, the second was for Maurício Gugelmin who <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the groove and hit the turn one outside barrier. His car slid across the wall and stopped at the corner's exit. The final stoppage was for a track inspection after Castroneves' pit crew reported the driver's right rear tyre was cut.|$|E
2500|$|This Thielvar {{had a son}} called Hafthi. And Hafthi's {{wife was}} called Whitestar. Those two {{were the first to}} settle on Gotland. The first night they slept {{together}} she dreamt that three snakes were coiled in her lap. And {{it seemed to her that}} they <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her lap. She told this dream to her husband Hafthi. He interpreted it thus: ...|$|E
60|$|Then he slanted {{his broad}} wings {{downward}} {{and without a}} sound <b>slid</b> down <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the sky till he was right behind Granny Fox.|$|R
60|$|He {{accompanied}} the command with a slow, dominant {{movement of the}} hickory rod he was carrying. The snake dropped its head, and <b>slid</b> noiselessly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the cleft across the trail and down the hill.|$|R
60|$|Very {{slowly the}} wing of his {{antagonist}} seemed to broaden as the impetus of his blow turned it up. He saw the full breadth of it and then it <b>slid</b> downward <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his sight.|$|R
2500|$|The second {{match was}} between John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield (JBL) and Chris Jericho. The match began with Jericho {{trapping}} Layfield in the Walls of Jericho. JBL {{got to the}} ropes, however, and <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ring with Jericho quickly following him. JBL strangled Jericho with the ring ropes and later, plunged him onto the ropes. Jericho recovered and clotheslined JBL out of the ring. When they got in again, JBL threw Jericho into the ring post, {{as a result of}} which, Jericho was busted open. JBL tried {{to take advantage of this}} situation, but Jericho still fought back. The fight went outside the ring, where JBL began clearing the ECW announce table. Jericho grabbed a steel chair and hit Layfield with it. The referee immediately disqualified Jericho, who ignored the fact that he had lost the match and started to strangle JBL with some wires by the ring, in the same process Layfield did to Jericho on Raw.|$|E
2500|$|O'Hare {{was last}} seen at the 5 o'clock {{position}} of the TBF. About that time, the turret gunner of the TBF, Alvin Kernan (AOM1/c) noticed a Japanese G4M Betty bomber above and almost directly behind O'Hare's 6 o'clock position. Kernan opened fire with the TBF's [...]50-cal. machine gun in the dorsal turret and a Japanese gunner fired back. Butch O'Hare's F6F Hellcat apparently {{was caught in a}} crossfire. Seconds later Butch's F6F <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> formation to port, pushing slightly ahead at about 160 knots and then vanished in the dark. The Avenger pilot, Lieutenant Commander Phillips, called repeatedly to O'Hare but received no reply. Ensign Skon responded: [...] "Mr. Phillips, this is Skon. I saw Mr. O'Hare's lights go out and, at the same instant, he seemed to veer off and slant down into darkness." [...] Phillips later asserted, as the Hellcat dropped out of view, it seemed to release something drop almost vertically at a speed too slow for anything but a parachute. Then something [...] "whitish-gray" [...] appeared below, perhaps the splash of the aircraft plunging into the sea.|$|E
2500|$|Leading West Indian batsmen Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul {{returned}} {{for the opening}} Test of the 2009–10 Australian cricket season starting on 26 November in Brisbane, after the industrial dispute was resolved. Ponting scored 55 in an Australian innings victory, before many sections of the media attacked the West Indies lack-lustre performance. Ponting produced scores of 35 and 20 in the following Test in Adelaide, as the touring side responded to their critics by securing a draw. For {{the first time since}} 2002, Ponting <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the top ten Test batting rankings—dropping to 12th—as Australia faced the prospect of falling to third in the team rankings if they were not able to achieve victory in the final Test of the series. Matters got worse for Ponting, as former Australian fast-bowler Rodney Hogg voiced that he should be sacked as captain and replaced with New South Wales leader Simon Katich. He said the team had become a [...] "boys club" [...] and was not preparing adequately for the future. However, former Australian Test opening batsman Justin Langer labelled Hogg's comments as [...] "rubbish", something that was backed by Katich.|$|E
6000|$|... "One, two, four--nine," [...] said Tom Platt, {{counting}} with a practised eye. [...] "Forty-seven. Penn, you're it!" [...] Dan let the after-tackle run, and <b>slid</b> him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the stern}} {{on to the}} deck amid a torrent of his own fish.|$|R
60|$|But she was {{not really}} unforgiving, and very soon she <b>slid</b> quietly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her hiding-place, and taking the silk from Laufer's hands began to weave it. So quick and clever was she that the blue dress was not only woven but embroidered, and Lineik was safe back in her tree before the prince returned.|$|R
50|$|There was {{no single}} event {{that marked the}} breakdown. Rather, the two churches <b>slid</b> into and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> schism {{over a period of}} several centuries, punctuated with {{temporary}} reconciliations.|$|R
2500|$|... "Suddenly, I {{heard the}} clatter of Leycester's machine gun above {{the roar of the}} engine. I looked round to see what he was {{shooting}} at, and nearly had a heart attack. Slanting down from above, getting nicely into position thirty yards behind my tail, was an Albatros. [...] "I immediately heaved the old A-W round in a split-arse turn, tighter I think than I had ever turned before. I felt a flash of panic as I lost sight of the Hun, but Leycester must have been able to see him all right as he kept on firing. My sudden turn had done the trick. The Albatros overshot and suddenly appeared right in front of me. Because of the relative motion of our two aircraft, he seemed to hang motionless, suspended in mid-air. I could see the pilot's face as he looked back at me. I sent a two-second burst of Vickers (machine gun) fire into him. His aircraft seemed to flutter, then <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight below my starboard wing. I was pretty certain that I had hit his petrol tank. Behind me, Leycester was still blazing away. He was using tracer (incendiary bullets), and it may have been one of his bullets that ignited the petrol pouring from the Hun's ruptured tank. When I caught sight of the Albatros again, it was burning like a torch and side-slipping towards the ground, trailing a streamer of smoke. For an instant I saw the German pilot, looking down {{over the side of the}} cockpit. Then the smoke and flames enveloped him." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{little brown}} hand <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its glove {{and dropped to}} my shoulder.|$|E
60|$|He turned round. She <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{her chair}} {{and came over to}} his side.|$|E
2500|$|One design {{common in}} early days, called a [...] "loose coupler", {{consisted}} of a smaller secondary coil inside a larger primary coil. The smaller coil was mounted on a rack {{so it could be}} slid linearly in or <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the larger coil. If radio interference was encountered, the smaller coil would be <b>slid</b> further <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the larger, loosening the coupling, narrowing the bandwidth, and thereby rejecting the interfering signal.|$|R
6000|$|... 'More than even, Slider,' {{returned}} Squeers; 'you'd {{have been}} even with him if he'd got married; but with the disappointment besides, you're a long way ahead. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> sight, <b>Slider,</b> quite <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight. And that reminds me,' he added, handing her the glass, 'if {{you want me to}} give you my opinion of them deeds, and tell you what you'd better keep and what you'd better burn, why, now's your time, Slider.' ...|$|R
60|$|The four-fifteen express <b>slid</b> softly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Paddington Station and Ashe Marson settled {{himself in}} the corner seat of his second-class compartment. Opposite him Joan Valentine had begun to read a magazine. Along the corridor, in a {{first-class}} smoking compartment, Mr. Peters was lighting a big black cigar. Still farther along the corridor, in a first-class non-smoking compartment, Aline Peters looked {{through the window and}} thought of many things.|$|R
60|$|The bar-tender, {{a native}} {{in a white}} jacket and a red lava-lava, without a word <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the small room.|$|E
6000|$|Grace <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed, {{ran across}} the room, and lifting the latch, said, [...] "I am not asleep, Grammer. Come in and talk to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, do," [...] said Anko. And then {{he slowly}} <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the hole, which {{immediately}} closed behind him, leaving the coral wall {{as solid as}} before.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{an elbow}} injury, Thiam topped the shot put with 14.91 m {{to take the}} lead in the third round. Solid marks from Ennis-Hill, Theisen-Eaton and Jones saw them remain in the top five. Her weakest event, Johnson-Thompson <b>slid</b> to <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the lead and into sixth place after a poor 11.68 m. Germany's Carolin Schafer moved into the top five with a {{personal}} best. Barbara Nwaba and Visser placed in the top three of this event but remained outside the top eight.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Crystal {{receiver}} from 1914 with [...] "loose coupler" [...] tuning transformer. The {{secondary coil}} (1) can be <b>slid</b> in or <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the primary (in box) {{to adjust the}} coupling. Other components: (2) primary tuning capacitor, (3) secondary tuning capacitor, (4) loading coil, (5) crystal detector, (8) headphones ...|$|R
50|$|The 1994/95 season brought little {{other than}} {{disappointment}} as the club <b>slid</b> quietly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the League of Wales with hardly a murmur. They were tailed off {{for most of}} the season and finished 22 points adrift of Mold Alexandra the other relegated club. One of the fifty players to feature in the first team that season Mark Jones, took over the managerial reins for the following term as the club returned to the Welsh League, and stayed as manager of the club for six seasons.|$|R
60|$|The young professor's {{shoulders}} <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the window. Carl carefully {{turned his}} head and found that now a form was leaning from the faculty-room window as well.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let me {{take the}} wheel now," [...] said Dunston Porter, quietly, and Dave <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the driving-seat willingly enough, for the {{excitement}} {{had left him}} somewhat limp.|$|E
6000|$|... "Me for Whittington!" [...] said Julius darkly. The {{train was}} just {{starting}} as he swung himself aboard. [...] "So long, Tommy." [...] The train <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the station.|$|E
60|$|The rocks {{ended and}} the stream bed began again, {{but this time it}} was wet, the bottom muddy and {{overgrown}} with moss. He was on the right track; not too long ago this stream had flowed, probably during the rainy season. He went up {{on the side of the}} stream, pushing through the ferns and vines. A golden snake <b>slid</b> expertly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his path. Something glinted ahead, something sparkling through the ferns. Water. A pool. He hurried, pushing the vines aside and stepping out, leaving them behind.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{when he saw}} {{his five}} little friends marching up the Laughing Brook, he guessed right away {{that it must be}} {{something}} to do with the trouble in the Smiling Pool. Ol' Mistah Buzzard just turned his broad wings and <b>slid</b> down, down <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the blue, blue sky until he was right over Grandfather Frog.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah reckon Unc' Billy 'lows he'll {{make me a}} visit," [...] said Ol' Mistah Buzzard with a chuckle, as he <b>slid</b> down, down <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the sky to {{the tall}} dead tree in the Green Forest, which is his {{favorite}} roosting-place. He hadn't been there long when Unc' Billy Possum came shuffling along, just {{as if he was}} out walking for his health.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Art thou only a beginner?' said E23, labouring {{literally}} for {{the dear}} life, as he <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his body-wrappings and stood {{clear in the}} loin-cloth while Kim splashed in a noble caste-mark on the ash-smeared brow.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked out}} {{and saw a}} number of people walking up and down the street. No one {{appeared}} to be watching me, and waiting a favorable opportunity, I <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the window to the sidewalk below.|$|E
60|$|As the German boy finished, he {{gave the}} horse {{a slap on the}} neck with his hands. In a twinkling, up came the steed's hind heels, and poor Hans <b>slid</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the saddle and down to the neck.|$|E
50|$|The {{completion}} of a road suitable for cars all around the lake in 1934-35, followed {{by the loss of}} the mail contract in 1934 to Marian B, made Tahoe uneconomical to operate, and she lay unused for several years. In 1940, Bliss's son William Seth Bliss repurchased the vessel from the operating company; his intent was scuttle her in shallow water off Glenbrook as a memorial to a bygone era, visible to glass-bottomed boats. Tahoe was scuttled on August 29, 1940, but the underwater slope was unexpectedly steep at the chosen location, and the ship <b>slid</b> down <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight, ending up with the bow at 360 ft and the stern at 490 ft.|$|R
60|$|The {{locomotive}} stopped, and {{the light}} from the long car windows fell upon the groups of watching fur-clad men, while here and there a shadowy object that showed black against it leaned out from a platform. There was, however, no sign of any passengers for the train until at the last moment two figures appeared hurrying along. They drew nearer, and Agatha set her lips tight as she recognized them, for the light from a vestibule shone into Hawtrey's face as he half lifted Sally on to one of the platforms and sprang up after her. Then the bell tolled again, and the train <b>slid</b> slowly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the station with its lights flashing upon the snow.|$|R
50|$|Obree's brother, Gordon, {{died in a}} {{car crash}} in October 1994, and Graeme Obree again <b>slid</b> in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> depression. In 2001 he was found {{unconscious}} at Bellsland Farm in Kilmaurs, 12 km from his Ayrshire home. The Obree family horse was stabled there, and he was discovered by a woman checking a barn. He had tried to hang himself. His wife, Anne, said he had been diagnosed as having severe bipolar disorder three years earlier.|$|R
