The recyclable material can be made water- and fire-resistant. It provides sufficient strength for use as a building material. Cellulose insulation made from recycled paper is becoming popular as an environmentally preferable material for building insulation. It can be treated with boric acid as a fire retardant.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the more}} common {{products}} which are asphalt/tar like, Waxoyl must be applied in warm ambient temperatures or heated in application, or alternatively thinned with white spirit {{in order to reduce}} its viscosity. Heating is usually done by placing its metal container in a bucket of hot water. The color of the product/solution varies. Waxoyl possesses a gold/amber tone (though black is also available) in solution, and after it is thinned by heating it is <b>sprayable.</b> It can be applied by brush without thinning or heating.

5000|$|Shotcrete, {{then known}} as gunite (/ˈgənīt/), was invented in 1907 by American {{taxidermist}} Carl Akeley to repair the crumbling facade of the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago (the old Palace of Fine Arts from the World's Columbian Exposition). [...] He used the method of blowing dry material out of a hose with compressed air, injecting water at the nozzle as it was released. In 1911, he was granted a patent for his inventions, the [...] "cement gun", the equipment used, and [...] "gunite", the material that was produced.

5000|$|The forms {{stand in}} stark {{contrast}} to the busy and highly developed commercial area that surrounds the space. There are places to walk and sit within the park, giving a passersby a chance to escape from the urban environment. Dark Star Park is more socially interactive than Holt’s other works. Holt paid attention to how people both inside and outside the park would see the spheres. The work alters the viewer’s perception by using curvilinear forms, such as the walkways that mimic the curving roads surrounding the site. Walking in the park or driving by it, viewers may mistake spheres of different sizes to actually be the same size or one sphere may eclipse another. The tunneled passages into the park frame certain sculptural elements, as do the reflections in the pools. However, Holt made sure not to alienate the park entirely from its surroundings. The spheres are made of gunite (a <b>sprayable</b> mixture of cement and sand), asphalt, precast concrete tunnels, steel poles and stone masonry. [...] These materials relate the park to the buildings located near the artwork.|$|E

5000|$|In 1886 Akeley {{moved on}} to the Milwaukee Public Museum (MPM) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Akeley {{remained}} in Milwaukee for six years, refining [...] "model" [...] techniques used in taxidermy. At the Milwaukee Public Museum, his early work consisted of animals found in Wisconsin prairies and woodlands. One of these was a diorama of a muskrat group, which is sometimes referred to as the first museum diorama; however, such dioramas, and dioramas depicting [...] "habitat groups," [...] dated back well into the early 1800s, and were quite popular with taxidermists in Victorian England. He also created historical reindeer and orangutan exhibits. Akeley left the Milwaukee Public Museum in 1892 and set up a private studio from which he continued to do contract work, including three mustangs for the Smithsonian Institution for exhibition at the World's Columbian Exposition. In 1896 he joined the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, where he developed his innovative taxidermy techniques, notably the creation of lightweight, hollow, but sturdy mannequins on which to mount the animals' skins. [...] He was also a prolific inventor, perfecting a [...] "cement gun" [...] to repair the crumbling facade of the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago (the old Palace of Fine Arts from the World's Columbian Exposition. [...] He is today known as the inventor of shotcrete, or [...] "gunite" [...] as he termed it at the time. Akeley did not use <b>sprayable</b> concrete in his taxidermy work, as is sometimes suggested. Akeley also invented a highly mobile motion picture camera for capturing wildlife, started a company to manufacture it, and patented it in 1915. The Akeley [...] "pancake" [...] camera (so-called because it was round) was soon adopted by the War Department for use in World War I, primarily for aerial use, and later by newsreel companies, and Hollywood studios, primarily for aerial footage and action scenes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a <b>sprayable</b> ECC in the context of material design under the guidance of micromechanical principles and rheological tools. Specifically, this study illustrates how the fresh properties suitable for wetmixture shotcreting may be realized, while accommodating the strain-hardening requirements imposed by micromechanical tailoring. Results from spray tests show that the fluid properties of predetermined ECC mixture are effectively modified by adopting rheological control parameters. Subsequent uniaxial tensile tests demonstrate the strain-hardening behavior comparable to that of cast ECC, for the same mixture design. One class of applications expected to benefit from <b>sprayable</b> ECC is repair of deteriorated infrastructures by wet-mixture shotcreting process. <b>Sprayable</b> ECC provides the large deformability often required in the repair materia...|$|E

40|$|Plastic mulch {{films are}} widely used in {{agriculture}} to enhance crop production by suppressing weeds, conserving soil water and increasing soil temperature. The majority of plastic mulch films are however not biodegradable and are typically removed after each growing season. Recovery of these plastics from the soil is difficult and can affect successive crop yields while causing substantive cost {{to the environment and}} farmers. Due to increasingly stringent regulations regarding use of non-degradable plastic in agriculture {{they are likely to be}} phased out in the near future. In the past 10 years several classes of &# 039;biodegradable&# 039; materials have been studied but most of these films are reported to be relatively weak in mechanical properties, not efficiently degradable and cost prohibitive. More recently, researchers have turned their attention to <b>sprayable</b> biodegradable polymer coatings for use on soils due to their easy application and versatility. The ability to mix natural additives, plasticizers and fillers to control and improve the mechanical and biodegradation properties of the core polymeric mulch film has been the driving force behind the development of these next generation <b>sprayable</b> polymeric mulch films. There have been many excellent review articles and papers written about polymeric mulch film, but the developing <b>sprayable</b> polymer systems have not been reviewed to the same extent. This paper focusses on the research progress in the area of biodegradable and <b>sprayable</b> polymer mulch film with emphasis on polymer formulations, properties and application.

40|$|The efcacy of {{microencapsulated}} <b>sprayable</b> pheromone {{was evaluated}} at different applica-tion rates and intervals for mating {{disruption of the}} oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck), in apple orchards during 2002. The following treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications: (i) a low rate of pheromone (6. 2 g a. i. ha 1) applied at 14 -day intervals, (ii) a medium rate of pheromone (12. 4 g a. i. ha 1) applied at 28 -day intervals, (iii) {{a high rate of}} pheromone (24. 7 g a. i. ha 1) applied at 28 - day intervals, and (iv) a non-pheromone control (insecticides only). The combination of a single insecticide application against rst generation G. molesta at petal fall with one pheromone application each for the second, third and fourth generations at 12. 424. 7 g a. i. ha 1 successfully controlled low populations. Pheromone-treated blocks had signicantly lower trap catches than those in the insecticide-treated control blocks. Among pheromone treatments, signicantly more moths were caught in the 6. 2 g compared with the 12. 4 and 24. 7 g rates. Fruit damage was < 1 % at harvest and there were no signicant differences among treatments. Low rate frequent applications of <b>sprayable</b> formulation appeared to be effective under low pest pressure but efcacy declined with increasing populations.

40|$|The type of <b>sprayable</b> surface {{impacts on}} {{residual}} efficacy of insecticide used in indoor residual spraying (IRS). However, {{there is limited}} data on common types of wall surfaces sprayed in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania where IRS began in 2006 and 2007 respectively. The study investigated residual efficacy of micro-encapsulated lambda-cyhalothrin sprayed on common surfaces of human dwellings and domestic animal shelters in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania.; An experimental hut was constructed with different types of materials simulating common <b>sprayable</b> surfaces in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania. Surfaces included cement plastered wall, mud-daub, white-wash, wood, palm-thatch, galvanized iron-sheets, burnt-bricks, limestone and oil-paint. The World Health Organization (WHO) procedure for IRS was used to spray lambda-cyhalothrin on surfaces at the dose of 20 - 25  mg/m(2). Residual efficacy of insecticide was monitored through cone bioassay using laboratory-reared mosquitoes; Kisumu strain (R- 70) of Anopheles gambiae ss. Cone bioassay was done every fortnight {{for a period of}} 152  days. The WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) threshold (80 % mortality) was used as cut-off point for acceptable residual efficacy.; A total of 5, 800 mosquitoes were subjected to contact cone bioassay to test residual efficacy of lambda-cyhalothrin. There was a statistically significant variation in residual efficacy between the different types of wall surfaces (r[*]=[*] 0. 24; p[*]>[*] 0. 001). Residual efficacy decreased with increasing pH of the substrate (r[*]=[*]- 0. 5; p[*]>[*] 0. 001). Based on WHOPES standards, shorter residual efficacy (42 - 56 days) was found in wall substrates made of cement, limestone, mud-daub, oil paint and white wash. Burnt bricks retained the residual efficacy up to 134  days while galvanized iron sheets, palm thatch and wood retained the recommended residual efficacy beyond 152  days.; The study revealed a wide variation in residual efficacy of micro encapsulated formulation of lambda-cyhalothrin across the different types of wall surfaces studied. In areas where malaria transmission is bimodal and wall surfaces with short residual efficacy comprise[*]<[*] 20 % of <b>sprayable</b> structures, two rounds of IRS using lambda-cyhalothrin should be considered. Further studies are required to investigate the impact of <b>sprayable</b> surfaces on residual efficacy of other insecticides commonly used for IRS in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania...|$|E

30|$|The use {{of certain}} <b>sprayable</b> {{hydrogel}} adhesion barriers {{has also been}} shown to be effective in reducing postoperative adhesion severity [16]. The authors are of the opinion that in cases where sutures have been taken {{on the surface of the}} uterus, using a <b>sprayable</b> hydrogel adhesion barrier results in lesser postoperative adhesions between the uterus and other organs, like the bowel and omentum. This is because the gel solidifies after spraying, has excellent tissue adherence, remains strongly adherent to the site of application for 5 to 7  days, and hence is ideal for the prevention of site-specific adhesions [16]. Hence, the effect of the cut ends of sutures, which would otherwise stimulate adhesion formation due to a foreign body reaction, is minimized. The hope is that an improved formula, which is highly effective, will be developed soon. At their institute, the authors now have a routine policy of using prewarmed, humidified CO 2 for every laparoscopic procedure. Adhesion barrier spray (SprayShield; Covidien) is routinely used after every myomectomy and adhesiolysis.|$|E
