50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>Light</b> <b>curtains</b> are {{opto-electronic}} {{devices that}} are used to safeguard personnel in the vicinity of moving machinery with the potential to cause harm such as presses, winders and palletisers. <b>Safety</b> <b>Light</b> <b>curtains</b> can be used as an alternative to mechanical barriers and other forms of traditional machine guarding. By reducing the need for physical guards and barriers, <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> <b>curtains</b> can increase the maintainability of the equipment they are guarding. The operability and efficiency of machinery can also be improved by the use of <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> <b>curtains</b> by, for example, allowing easier access for semi-automatic procedures.|$|R
50|$|Typically, <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> <b>curtains</b> are {{connected}} to a safety relay which will remove motive power from the hazard {{in the event that}} an object is detected. Safety relays can be provided with muting functionality which enables the temporary disabling of the safety function to allow objects to pass through the <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> <b>curtains</b> without tripping the safety relay. This is particularly useful for machinery which has some semi-automatic procedures.|$|R
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>Light</b> <b>curtains</b> are {{supplied}} as a {{pair with}} a transmitter and receiver. The transmitter projects an array of parallel infrared light beams to the receiver which consists {{of a number of}} photoelectric cells. When an object breaks {{one or more of the}} beams a stop signal is sent to the guarded equipment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>Light</b> <b>curtains</b> {{fall into}} a {{category}} of equipment known as presence detection devices. Other common presence detection devices are pressure-sensitive safety mats and laser scanners (often used on Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) when in industrial settings). Most important application of safety relays is in automation industries dealing with robotic cell set up.|$|R

5000|$|... ===Ram / Slide=== The {{vertical}} {{motion of the}} slide acts like a hammer to an anvil. When presses are used manually, where an operator is loading and unloading parts, extreme caution should be used and proper methods of safe guarding should be in place. With the addition of <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> <b>curtains</b> and an I-PRESS control, the <b>light</b> <b>curtains</b> can then be muted or turned off on the slide upstroke to increase productivity when press is being used in single stroke mode. Standard modes of operation with up to date safe press controls are OFF-INCH-SINGLE STROKE & CONTINUOUS modes which can be selected via a keyed mode selector switch. Special modes of operation include, MICRO INCH-SSD/SINGLE ON DEMAND & CSD/CONTINUOUS ON DEMAND. Micro Inch is normally used for die set up near the BDC / Bottom Dead Center, SSD Single Stroke on Demand can be used when long coil feed lengths or automation loading and unloading will trigger SSD. CSD Continuous on Demand is normally used when press are used in roll form lines or irregular stroking is required when punching holes in large panel with gag feed dies.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the properties and possible applications of the „CANopen Safety Chip (CSC) “ in safety related devices. The object being described is a chip, partially certified by TÜV, which has met all {{the requirements of the}} IEC 61508 standard up to SIL 3 (safety integrity level). With the implementation of the CSC in safety related systems, a considerable reduction in costs for development and certification is achieved. Time to market is reduced noticeably. The structures of the CSC and the safety related permanent firmware are described here as well. Examples are shown to demonstrate possible applications. For example, the CSC assumes all control and monitoring functions in simple fail safe sensor/actuator systems. In complex devices (such as <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> <b>curtains,</b> drives) it can be integrated as a communication interface. There is a function and data interface available to serve as an interface to the application. This allows the user to access the CANopen functions, safety relevant data and the Object Dictionary. The user-oriented programmability of the CSC facilitates flexible implementation in various application environments...|$|R
30|$|In {{view of the}} {{considerations}} outlined above, {{emergency off}} and overrule functions must be realized in terms of information technology {{as a matter of}} principle, given the risk potential of partially autonomously operating service robots. 6 Special possibilities with regard to the division of tasks derive from the optical, acoustic and haptic signal processing systems that robots are increasingly equipped with. This could enable users to program robots by way of natural speech or special teaching methods (such as demonstration-imitation). Some {{progress has been made in}} the programming of robots in recent years, enabling the robots to be controlled by manual operating devices ("gaming console") (Klempert 2012), the manual guidance of robots (Mentgen 2011), the utilization of tablet computers (Innovationsagentur für IT und Medien 2011), as well as imitation learning (Institut für Anthropomatik 2012) and speech commands (Hochschule Ulm 2012). All this facilitates the flexible deployment of service robots also by technically unskilled persons. At the same time, elements have been developed such as <b>safety</b> <b>light</b> <b>curtains,</b> trunk-like robot arms, foam protective layers for robots with food sensors with which robot movements can be stopped depending on human action or slowed down. These measures serve to improve safety in work systems shared by humans and robots below the emergency-off level (cf. Mentgen 2011, for example).|$|R
40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>curtains</b> are {{presence}} detection devices, typically em-ployed to detect when an object enters (or passes through) a region to initiate emergency security procedures. However, most existing <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> implementations are {{not designed to}} detect the precise location where the barrier was broken. In this paper, we present a hardware prototype implementation that is {{able to identify the}} locations where the <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> was broken, even if multiple objects penetrate the barrier si-multaneously. To this end, we deploy techniques from sparse signal recovery and compressive sensing to perform detec-tion and localization with only a few infrared transmitters and sensors. The proposed prototype implementation is scalable to large physical sizes and can be tailored to suit a particu-lar application {{in terms of the number}} and size of objects to detect, as well as the desired spatial resolution.

5000|$|One {{category}} of presence sensing devices is Photoelectric Sensors. <b>Light</b> <b>Curtains</b> {{fall into this}} category. <b>Light</b> <b>curtains</b> use many infrared light beams to form a perimeter around machinery. When two or more consecutively adjacent beams are interrupted, a kill-switch stops the machine until the boundary is reset. <b>Light</b> <b>curtains</b> must be {{placed in front of}} the work area. This makes it difficult for press brake operators to work on small parts. One cannot help but disrupt the beam. The operator might [...] "mute" [...] the <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> {{in order to get the}} job done. Certain parts of the beam can be muted. For example, muting the front and rear of the beam allows the middle to offer continued protection for the operator. Additionally, it may be necessary to use auxiliary light beams if the operator will reach between the main light beams and the edge of certain machines.|$|R
50|$|Packaging Equipment or pallet {{wrappers}} have {{a moving}} load and an arm that stretches plastic wrap around the load. Typically a three sided wire partition guard is placed around the wrapper, and a <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> controls {{access to the}} open side where the wrapper is accessed by a lift truck.Robotic Welding Cells incorporate wire mesh fixed barriers outfitted with vinyl welding <b>curtains</b> and <b>light</b> <b>curtains</b> or pressure sensitive mats. The welding curtains mounted inside of the fixed barrier control exposure to welding flash, sparks and spatter from the welding operation. While the <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> or pressure sensitive mats prevent welding operations while the operator is loading/unloading the weld fixtures. Robotic Material Handling for pallet pack or de-palletizing could use any of the aforementioned guarding systems. <b>Light</b> <b>curtains</b> or pressure sensitive mats {{around the perimeter of}} the work area that stop the robot when an operator enters. Wire partition could be used around the work area with an interlocked gate which stops the robot when opened.|$|R
50|$|<b>Light</b> <b>curtain</b> {{systems may}} be used alone or in {{conjunction}} with other guarding systems. The <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> projects a field or beams of light between two points and, when the field is broken-at any point, the <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> system interrupts the circuit it is wired into. These can be used in areas where an operator must interact with operating equipment to prevent movement of the equipment while the operator works a hazardous area.Pressure sensitive mats that are wired into the equipment’s control system can be placed in hazardous areas and be set to stop the equipment if stepped on. These devices can be used alone or {{in conjunction with other}} guarding devices, usually at operator interaction points.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Light</b> <b>curtain</b> puppet presentations use {{light to}} {{highlight}} small portions {{of a performance}} area, allowing the puppet to be seen while the manipulators remain invisible. The puppets stand on a stage divided into an unlit background and a well-lit foreground, meeting to form a [...] "curtain" [...] of light. The puppeteer dresses in black and remains hidden in the unlit background of the stage while the puppet is held across the <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> in the lit foreground of the stage. [...] "Light curtain puppet" [...] is an umbrella term, and any puppet which is extended into a well-lit area where its handler remains separated from the puppet by a division of light may be called a <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> puppet.|$|R

40|$|Active {{optical sensing}} (LIDAR and <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> transmission) devices {{mounted on a}} mobile {{platform}} can correctly detect, localize, and classify trees. To conduct an evaluation and comparison of the different sensors, an optical encoder wheel was used for vehicle odometry and provided a measurement of the linear displacement of the prototype vehicle along a row of tree seedlings as a reference for each recorded sensor measurement. The field trials were conducted in a juvenile tree nursery with one-year-old grafted almond trees at Sierra Gold Nurseries, Yuba City, CA, United States. Through these tests and subsequent data processing, each sensor was individually evaluated to characterize their reliability, {{as well as their}} advantages and disadvantages for the proposed task. Test results indicated that 95. 7 % and 99. 48 % of the trees were successfully detected with the LIDAR and <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> sensors, respectively. LIDAR correctly classified, between alive or dead tree states at a 93. 75 % success rate compared to 94. 16 % for the <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> sensor. These results can help system designers select the most reliable sensor for the accurate detection and localization of each tree in a nursery, which might allow labor-intensive tasks, such as weeding, to be automated without damaging crops.

40|$|Advances in {{the usage}} of {{computer}} imaging, communication technologies and the successful development of new techniques for precision agriculture have facilitated a smart-digital revolution in row crop agriculture in recent years. The use of a yield monitor, variable rate application (VRA) for fertilizer and herbicides, soil property maps and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology has enabled the development of computer generated prescription maps for farm management. All these technologies are changing agricultural practices from simple mechanical operations to automated operations implemented by robotic-based systems. The automation of individual crop plant care in vegetable crop fields has increased its practical feasibility and improved efficiency and economic benefit. A systems-based approach is a key feature in the mechanization engineering design via the incorporation of precision sensing techniques. The objective {{of this study was}} to design sensing capabilities for Implementation to measure plant spacing under different test conditions (California, USA and Andalucía, Spain). Three different optical sensors were used: an optical <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> transmitter and receiver (880 nm), a LiDAR sensor (905 nm), and an RGB camera. An active photoelectric transmission sensor, which contained 3 pairs of optical <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> transmitters and receivers, evaluated the interruption by the tomato stem of the <b>light</b> <b>curtain</b> between the two devices, and was recorded simultaneously in real-time by a high-speed embedded control system. The LiDAR (model LMS 211 in California and LMS 111 in Spain, from SICK AG) was installed in a vertical orientation in the middle of the mobile platform. Additionally, a RGB spatial mosaicked image was used to adjust the data from the light beam and LiDAR sensor and obtain combined information (RGBD where D is for distance). These sensors were used to properly detect, localize, and discriminate between weed and tomato plants. The use of this detection system may result in a new technique that allows for the automatic control of aggressive weeds and the automation of weeding tools...|$|R
