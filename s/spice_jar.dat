5000|$|She {{designed}} the {{set for the}} Off-Broadway one-man show Dinner With Demons at the Second Stage Theater in 2003, which was written and performed by her husband, Jonathan Reynolds. She was the [...] "chief advocate" [...] for this production. The CurtainUp reviewer noted: [...] "Having won her case, she's created a set that is a star in its own right. The wide stage is flanked by two colorful cornucopias of fruits, vegetables and breads, with a floor to ceiling backdrop of <b>spice</b> <b>jar</b> filled glass shelves and overhanging the work area there's thousands {{of dollars worth of}} shiny copper utensils..." [...] She {{designed the}} sets for King Lear in 2007 at the Public Theater, starring Kevin Kline. Ben Brantley, The New York Times reviewer wrote: [...] "Ms. Ettinger’s tiered high-concept set combines industrial chic with a feeling of elemental magic." ...|$|E
40|$|Caking, whereby {{free flowing}} {{particles}} aggregate to form lumps is a common problem during handling and storage of food powders. Seasoning companies have experienced consumer dissatisfaction related to difficulties emptying the <b>spice</b> <b>jar</b> or get lumps of spices when emptying a bag with a spice blend. One way of preventing the caking development is to add {{a small amount of}} anti-­‐caking agent. One of the most widely used anti-­‐caking agent is silicon dioxide, labeled as E 551. During the past years, the consumer’s demand for products with fewer additives has increased. This project focused on finding natural anti-­‐caking agents that could replace silicon dioxide in spice products, to get a consumer-­friendly labeling while also solving the caking problem. The caking development was studied in the easily caked Lemon juice powder and Red Onion Seasoning mix containing native potato starch, inulin and a rice fiber as natural anti-­‐caking agents. The replacing alternatives were evaluated based on how they affect the sorption isotherm, glass transition and flowability, as well as sensory properties of the host powders. Moisture sorption isotherms as well as glass transition analysis clarified that water has a large impact on the caking development in the hygroscopic host powders. Glass transition measurements in combination with the flowability analysis, demonstrated that 5 % native potato starch, at lower relative humidities theoretically {{could be used as a}} silicon dioxide replacer. It was shown that the glass transition temperature of Lemon juice powder was increased while adding 5 % native potato starch, which theoretically indicates less stickiness, and consequently reduced risk of caking. Further, Lemon juice powder containing 5 % native potato starch presented flow function in the free flowing area, which further promotes its use as a natural anti-­‐caking/ flowagent. The result from the sensory analysis confirmed that there is no significant difference between products containing 1. 7 % silicon dioxide and 5 % native potato starch...|$|E
50|$|Special {{glass jars}} were {{manufactured}} {{to fit the}} cabinet and its racks. A major manufacturer of the glassware was Sneath Glass Company. Original sets of Hoosier glassware consisted of coffee and tea canisters, a salt box, and four to eight <b>spice</b> <b>jars.</b> Some manufacturers also included a cracker jar. One distinctive form was a cylindrical jar with a ring molded around its center, {{to allow it to}} rest in the holes of a metal hanging rack.|$|R
40|$|Baker’s {{cabinets}} {{became popular}} in the late 19 th century. The free-standing cabinet included a table with drawers and an upper section with shelves for storage. The Hoosier cabinet took this design a step further, with increased storage and built-in efficiencies such as flour bins, mechanical sifters, and <b>spice</b> <b>jars.</b> The cabinets included several compartments to store all the various utensils, dishes, and staple items a cook would need – making them all conveniently located within reach.

5000|$|By 1899, {{the company}} was listed as the only {{manufacturer}} of semaphore globes and bulls eye lenses. However, {{the company was}} diversifying from its lighting products portfolio with fruit jars and glassware. Three sizes of Mason jars were being hand blown by 1908. The Sneath jars {{were said to be}} [...] "superior and more durable than machine made jars." [...] Around the same time, the company began making glass s for kitchen cabinet companies, including the Hoosier cabinet made by Hoosier Manufacturing Company. This began the gradual (but important) transition from manufacturer of globes to manufacturer of glass products for portable kitchen cabinets. Cabinet products included salt and sugar bins, <b>spice</b> <b>jars,</b> and coffee and tea jars. From 1914 to 1916, management patented dispensing caps, a dispensing jar, and a bracket for supporting dispensing bins used in kitchen cabinets.|$|R
500|$|Included in {{the cargo}} were items of varying purposes, from <b>spice</b> <b>jars</b> and ewers to inkwells, funeral urns and gilt-silver boxes. The cargo was {{described}} by John Guy of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as [...] "the richest and largest consignment of early ninth-century southern Chinese gold and ceramics ever discovered in a single hoard." [...] The cargo also included spices and resin, and metal ingots used as ballast. There were also special items found which include a gold cup—the largest Tang dynasty gold cup ever found—and a large silver flask decorated {{with a pair of}} ducks. The gold cup has pictures of people in various actions on its sides, such as musicians and a Persian dancer. It also has images of two men on its thumb plate with features that appear to be non-Chinese, as they are depicted with curly hair.|$|R

The two teams must bake for the UK's biggest dance group, Diversity.For {{the first part of}} the challenge, the bakers have been asked to {{showcase}} their style and skill by piping the words 'Bake Off' alongside a butterfly; they must try and identify the extra baking powder in Mary's Victoria sponge; and finally they have to identify the <b>spices</b> in the <b>jars</b> through the use of their smell.|$|R
40|$|On October 17, 1961, at 3. 47 in the afternoon, artist Daniel Spoerri traced all {{the objects}} {{gathered}} on the blue tabletop of his Parisian hotel room onto a large sheet of paper. Paper clips, wine stoppers, matchboxes, burnt matches, <b>spice</b> <b>jars,</b> cutlery, leftover bread, spilled salt – nothing was left out, nothing was deemed too unimportant. Each outline – 80 in total – was then numbered and annotated in a corresponding note. In a sober, mock-encyclopedic style Spoerri described one object after the other, noting details such as visual appearance, text printed on product packaging, {{the cost of the}} item etc. A good deal of the notes were also furnished with additional anecdotal material, such as the circumstance of the objects’ acquisition, the use they had been put to, stories relating to Spoerri’s friends and acquaintances, short descriptions of how they ended up on the table in the first place, or other tidbits of information. Whenever he felt it necessary, Spoerri added footnotes to the notes for further elaborations, engaging the help of his good friend Robert Filliou to correct his memory or his French. The resulting collection of notes was published, together with the outline of the objects, as a small booklet in February 1962. And by 1968 two more editions of the book had been published, each with new material and footnotes added to the work by Spoerri as well as from his friends Emmett Williams and Dieter Roth. This thesis is a study of this collaborative work: An Anecdoted Topography of Chance. It argues that the work should be understood not just as a collection of notes bound together as a book, but as an archive generated from a principle of openness and potentially endless accumulation. It will discuss how the work is underpinned and shaped by media technologies such as photography and sound recording, pointing to the broadening of the book format that accelerated through the proliferation of artists’ books in the 1960 s. It will also look at some possible implications of the work’s archival character, specifically how its proximity to everyday life and the life of its main author can be viewed as symptomatic for a kind of “soft” power that aims at a non-coercive control of life...|$|R
