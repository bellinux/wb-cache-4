5|$|The visual {{theme for}} the video is the Chinese legend of Houyi. The video goes on to {{introduce}} King Di-Jun, his ten sons (who are also the Celestial Suns), Queen Xi and Warrior Yi. The video shows one of the King's ten sons being <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of the jade dragon, but breaks free and the sons made life on Earth unbearable, so the King send the warrior who was introduced earlier to kill them. He succeeds in finding them, and kills all but one.|$|E
5|$|The copious {{amounts of}} blood spilled {{in the fight}} scenes came from bags of fake blood <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> performers' bodies. Animal blood {{gathered}} from slaughterhouses was poured onto the floor to simulate puddles of human blood. Most of the times trick swords made from fiberglass were used when the scene called for a killing blow. Designed by Allder, these swords could also retract their blades, and several sprayed blood from their tips. Although the swords were intended to be safer alternatives to metal weapons, they could still be dangerous: {{in one of the}} fights, Bergman sparred with an extra who failed to follow the choreography and sliced open her finger.|$|E
5|$|The Pip-Boy – a small {{computer}} <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> character's wrist {{which contains}} maps, statistics, data, and items – {{plays a role}} in both Fallout 4 and Nuka-World. When the player reaches level thirty and is able to explore Nuka-World, the Pip-Boy receives a radio signal alerting the player. Nuka-World adds minor additions to the game's crafting mechanics, allowing the player to mix varieties of Nuka-Cola to create new flavors; these grant the player additional status buffs, such as temporary boosts to health, increased damage resistance, or improved S.P.E.C.I.A.L attributes. S.P.E.C.I.A.L. is an acronym denoting the character attributes which the player can distribute through the means of acquired stat points. The available character attributes consist of: strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility, and luck. In order to create these items, players need to collect raw materials from the game world and find recipe books to unlock new flavors.|$|E
50|$|Another {{application}} is spot welding <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> nickel-cadmium or nickel-metal hydride cells <b>to</b> make batteries. <b>The</b> cells {{are joined by}} spot welding thin nickel <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> battery terminals. Spot welding can keep the battery from getting too hot, as might happen if conventional soldering were done.|$|R
50|$|Fastening <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ski {{was always}} a challenge, often {{requiring}} slots to be cut into the ski. A key advance was introduced by Fritz R. Huitfeldt, who used a metal plate that was screwed onto {{the top of the}} ski with short vertical extensions that had holes <b>to</b> attach <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> <b>to.</b> <b>The</b> major advantage <b>to</b> this design is that the vertical extensions held the boot firmly centered on the ski, whereas the former all-strap systems generally had considerable flop. Variations on this design led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shaping of <b>the</b> metal plate <b>to</b> progressively hold <b>the</b> toe more firmly.|$|R
50|$|Almost similar {{performed}} mounting straps {{do exist}} for different coloured uniform parts {{as well as}} to Army, Air Force and Navy persons in uniform. Army persons in uniform for example wear on shoulder <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grey pullover, black mounting straps with bright-grey (for generals gold-yellow) emblems (see image a.).|$|R
5|$|One of the {{gameplay}} mechanics which {{carried over}} from the previous iterations is V.A.T.S. (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System). While using V.A.T.S., real-time combat is slowed, allowing the player to choose where to shoot the enemy: shooting enemies in the head will typically result in death while shooting their legs can slow them. Weapons can also be shot at to disarm the enemy. Using V.A.T.S. lowers the player's stamina (Action Points, or AP). Some actions are unavailable to the player if their stamina is insufficient, {{in which case the}} player has to wait for their AP to regenerate. The use of Power Armor in combat increases {{the rate at which the}} player's AP are used. The Pip-Boy, a small computer <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> character's wrist, also plays a role in both Fallout 4 and Far Harbor. It contains a menu which the player can access to view maps, statistics, data, and items, and when the player is able to visit Far Harbor, the Pip-boy will receive a signal from Valentine's Detective Agency.|$|E
5|$|Production {{moved to}} the Czech Republic later in May, {{scheduled}} for 12 weeks of shooting, which included a scene in Pernštejn Castle. Using a former sugar factory in Prague, production designer John Myhre constructed a large textile factory {{as part of an}} industrial world, the setting of a mythological environment in which looms create fabrics that weavers interpret as assassination orders. Afterward, filming moved to Budapest, then returned to Chicago in August. While the actors performed many of their own stunts, with free running and parkour in some of the action scenes, and Angelina Jolie being actually <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hood of a moving Dodge Viper, some of the especially high-risk sequences required digital doubles instead. Two full-sized train cars were built, a Chicago 'L' for a training scene where Fox and Wesley run atop a train, and a Czech Pendolino for the derailment, which was stationed in a gimbal equipped with hydraulics to allow the car to tilt and roll as the train crashed. The film originally had both an alternate opening and an alternate ending. The alternate opening, a flashback to ancient times describing the history of the Fraternity and the Loom of Fate, is available on the special edition DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E
25|$|The friends {{return to}} Welsh's bar, with Michael's deer <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{hood of the}} car. They enter rambunctiously, {{spraying}} beers over each other and singing loudly. Welsh then {{makes his way to}} the piano and begins playing Chopin's Nocturne No. 6 Op. 15-3.|$|E
25|$|Other {{types of}} dildos include those {{designed}} to be fitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> face of one party, inflatable dildos, and dildos with suction cups attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> base (sometimes {{referred to as a}} wall mount). Other types of harness mounts for dildos (besides <b>strapping</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> groin) include thigh mount, face mount, or furniture mounting straps.|$|R

25|$|According to Blake, he {{also worked}} the {{medicine}} show circuit and was employed by a Quaker doctor. He played a Melodeon <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of the medicine wagon. Blake stayed with the show only two weeks, however, because the doctor's religion didn't allow the serving of Sunday dinner.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses {{described}} {{the mood in}} the execution chamber as somber, and Williams showed no resistance as he was led into the execution chamber. After Williams was <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gurney, he struggled against the straps holding him down to look up at the press gallery behind him, and to exchange glances with his supporters.|$|E
25|$|For Papanui {{residents}} in the 1950s and 1960s the name 'Handlebar Harry' will bring back memories of a tall policeman on a push bike. Constable Ronald Miles was the local enquiry officer and had the habit of riding the streets of Papanui with his typewriter <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> handlebars of his cycle. However {{it was not the}} position of the typewriter that earned him the nickname, it was his wonderful 'Jimmy Edwards' style flowing moustache.|$|E

50|$|Hook is a {{rectangular}} shape, similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> slides {{but with an}} opening at its one end which used to hang detachable or multi-way <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> a bra. It is hooking bra shoulder <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> a strapless bra, re-positioning <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> achieve <b>the</b> various looks, such as halter-neck and crossed-back.|$|R
25|$|A {{butterfly}} gag is a wing-shaped gag that {{is usually}} inflatable {{by means of a}} rubber bulb. The central part fits behind the teeth to fill up the mouth, while the wings go between the teeth and the lips. The gag inflates {{in the shape of a}} butterfly. This kind of gag is very hard to keep in the wearer; the use of an O-ring in front of the gag <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of the head will hold the butterfly gag in place.|$|E
25|$|Bailout gas for a {{back-mounted}} configuration may {{be carried}} {{in a variety of}} ways in a bailout cylinder. The most popular being as a sling cylinder, a pony cylinder <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> primary back mounted cylinder, or in a small cylinder (Spare air) supported by a pocket attached to the buoyancy compensator. When more than one cylinder of the same mix are side-mounted, the cylinders not in use function as bailout sets, provided they contain enough gas to get the diver safely to the surface.|$|E
25|$|Also called combo consoles, {{these are}} usually hard rubber or tough plastic moldings which enclose the SPG and have {{mounting}} sockets for other diver instrumentation, such as decompression computers, underwater compass, timer and/or depth gauge and occasionally {{a small plastic}} slate on which notes can be written either before or during the dive. These instruments would otherwise be carried somewhere else such as <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wrist or forearm or in a pocket and are only regulator accessories for convenience of transport and access, and {{at greater risk of}} damage during handling.|$|E

50|$|A {{surfboard}} leash or leg rope is {{the cord}} that attaches a surfboard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surfer. It prevents the surfboard from being {{swept away by}} waves and stops runaway surfboards from hitting other surfers and swimmers. Modern leashes comprise a urethane cord where one end has a band with a velcro <b>strap</b> attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surfer's trailing foot, and the opposite has a velcro <b>strap</b> attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{tail end of the}} surfboard.|$|R
50|$|A {{difference}} between the early S & W Army No 2 Model, serial range 1 to about 3000 and later revolvers, is the addition of third pin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top <b>strap</b> <b>to</b> limit <b>the</b> travel upwards of the cylinder stop.|$|R
25|$|Burou’s first vaginoplasty, in 1956, {{took him}} {{three hours to}} complete, however {{at the height of}} his sex-reassignment work by 1974, {{performing}} up to six vaginoplasties a month, he could complete the procedure in one hour. The post-op patient’s arms were <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bed for the first night after the procedure. The drain was removed 48 hours after surgery, the catheter four days, and the stent eight. The new vagina was managed by frequent or daily insertion of fingers or retractors, and the new urethra was kept open by the daily introduction of the catheter, ensuring against neomeatal stenosis. Most patients spent two weeks in the clinic.|$|E
25|$|Super Attack Ball: The team's second {{finishing}} attack, {{received in}} episode 3. To be summoned, Soccer Yellow throws a medal {{into the sky}} and the Super Attack Ball descends from the Moon. It is then passed from member to member and Boxing Red punches it into the enemy. The Sport Rangers' first attempt to use the Super Attack Ball was unsuccessful, they were unable to smoothly pass it to each other. To improve on their teamwork, they lined up with their legs <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> person next to them and tried to run together. With their new team skills, they were able to complete the combination attack during their second try.|$|E
25|$|Saturday afternoon, a vengeful off-duty highway patrolman {{and some}} local racist thugs {{break into the}} KOW studio and assault Super Soul and his engineer. Near the California state line, Kowalski is helped by a hippie biker, Angel (Timothy Scott), who gives him pills to help him stay awake. Angel's girlfriend (Gilda Texter), who rides a {{motorcycle}} nude, recognizes Kowalski and shows him a collage she made of newspaper articles about his police career. Kowalski suspects that Super Soul's broadcast is now being directed by the police to entrap him. Confirming {{that the police are}} indeed waiting at the border, Angel helps Kowalski get through the roadblock {{with the help of an}} old air raid siren and a small motorbike with a red headlight <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the Challenger, simulating a police car. Kowalski finally reaches California by Saturday 7:12 pm. He calls Jake the dealer from a payphone to reassure him that he still intends to deliver the car on Monday.|$|E
40|$|The tension straps, {{which are}} {{primarily}} {{part of the}} preload structure, are also used <b>to</b> support <b>the</b> leads. The straps must support <b>the</b> lead connection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coil, and must support the uncompensated parts of the leads. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lorentz loading, the displacements of <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> global structural behavior should be imposed on the short runs of lead connections that bridge from <b>the</b> <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coils. In the present design the transfer of support of the lead between coil and strap is abrupt, and prone to stress concentration. A support concept that is schematically shown in figure 2 is recommended. It results from attempts to allow some flexibility in lead support as the support is transferred from coil <b>to</b> <b>strap,</b> while supporting <b>the</b> Lorentz loads on the lead. In this concept, radial differential coil / strap motions are allowed and are absorbed by flexure of {{a portion of the}} vertical run of the lead. Circumferentia...|$|R
50|$|Corps troop-function colours (de: Waffenfarben) {{have been}} {{traditionally}} used in German armed forces since the 19th century. By German Bundeswehr personnel in uniform of Heer and Luftwaffe corps colored pippin and padding (4 mm broad plain braiding) on shoulder straps and cuffs {{are used in}} order <b>to</b> characterise <b>the</b> membership <b>to</b> an armed service, a special force, or a particular assignment. Corps colored loops might be used on mounting <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> field uniform. The collar patches on uniform jackets show corps colors as well.|$|R

25|$|Because of the {{propensity}} for heavy fog {{in some parts}} of the British Isles, fog signal rules were established on the UK railway system to keep train traffic moving without incurring the severe delays that would be necessary if drivers had to stop or travel slowly up to each signal and read its indication. During heavy fog, fogsignalmen would be stationed at distant signals with a lantern and detonators – small explosive charges that could be <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rail to be exploded by the wheels of a train. The fogsignalman's duty was to repeat the indication of the signal using his lantern; the semaphore arm was usually obscured by fog and hence invisible to the driver of a moving train. If the distant signal were displaying 'caution' (warning that a signal ahead was at 'danger'), the detonators remained on the rail and the fogsignalman would show a yellow lamp to show 'caution'; if the distant signal were clear, the detonators would be removed from the rails and a green lamp would be displayed.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Godwin {{was living}} in Palm Springs, California, working as a {{self-employed}} tool salesman, a mechanic, and a construction worker, with no discernible criminal history. Godwin and his roommate, Frank Soto, Jr., planned to rob a drug dealer and pilot, Kim Robert LeValley, who was once a friend of theirs. Godwin and Soto lured LeValley back to their condominium where Soto held him, Godwin punched and kicked him, tried to strangle him, then ultimately stabbed LeValley 26 times with his butcher knife., however, during the trial, the prosecution said that Godwin used a serrated edge knife. A butcher's knife was not mentioned. After the murder, Godwin and Soto loaded the body into a truck and set off for the desert. Godwin tried {{to blow up the}} evidence by using homemade explosives <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body. The explosion was intended to disguise the murder of LeValley. On August 3, 1980, some Eagle Mountain residents found a blown-up pickup truck with remains of a human body inside of it abandoned in the desert.|$|E
25|$|On 23 January 2015, {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling, Magnus {{competed in the}} Feast or Fired match {{grabbing}} the final case which contained a TNA World Tag Team Championship title opportunity, in which Bram {{claimed to have been}} the one to obtain it for himself but the chance was stolen from Magnus. On 30 January, episode of Impact Wrestling, Magnus tried to reconcile with Bram in a bar, but after leaving the bar he was then viciously attacked by Bram, this act turned Magnus face once again. The following week Mickie James, (Magnus's real-life fiancé) returned to TNA to confront Bram who threatened Mickie in return. The week after, Magnus returned and attacked Bram in retaliation for threatening Mickie. This would lead to a match between the two which Magnus won by disqualification after Magnus was <b>strapped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ropes, after which Mickie ran down to the ring and was grabbed by Bram who forced Magnus to kiss his boot, to which he obliged. Magnus would get redemption and attack Bram backstage. This would lead to a No Disqualification match between the two which Magnus won to end the feud.|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} on the nail gun is the palm nailer, which is a lightweight handheld pneumatic nailer that <b>straps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hand. It is convenient for working in tight spaces where a conventional nailer will not fit and is flexible enough to drive either short nails into metal straps or six inch nails into timber. By repeated hammer action (of around 40 hits per second) the fastener is driven into the material by a more constant palm pressure (as opposed to a conventional nailgun which drives the nail against the inertia of the nailgun).|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 1970s some players were experimenting with finger-style techniques, where {{individual}} {{fingers of the}} right hand would pluck specific strings, rather than simply hold a pick and strum chords. Bryan Bowers became a master of this mode of playing, and developed a complex technique utilizing all five fingers of his right hand. This allows him to play independent bass notes, chords, melody, and counter melodies as a soloist. Bowers {{was also one of}} the early pioneers in adding a <b>strap</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> instrument and playing it while standing up.|$|R
