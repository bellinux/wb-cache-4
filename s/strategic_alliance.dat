The common threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War led to Turkey's membership of NATO in 1952, ensuring close bilateral relations with Washington. Subsequently Turkey benefited from the United States' political, economic and diplomatic support, including in key {{issues such as the}} country's bid to join the European Union. In the post–Cold War environment, Turkey's geostrategic importance shifted towards its proximity to the Middle East, the Caucasus and the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{the local}} Republican {{committee}} nominated Coolidge for {{election to the}} state House of Representatives. He won a close victory over the incumbent Democrat, and reported to Boston for the 1907 session of the Massachusetts General Court. In his freshman term, Coolidge served on minor committees and, although he usually voted with the party, {{was known as a}} Progressive Republican, voting in favor of such measures as women's suffrage and the direct election of Senators. While in Boston, Coolidge became an ally, and then a liegeman, of then U.S. Senator Winthrop Murray Crane who controlled the western faction of the Massachusetts Republican Party; Crane's party rival in the east of the commonwealth was U.S. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge. Another key <b>strategic</b> <b>alliance</b> which Coolidge forged was with Guy Currier, who had served in both state houses and had the social distinction, wealth, personal charm and broad circle of friends which Coolidge lacked, and which would have a lasting impact on his political career. In 1907, he was elected to a second term, and in the 1908 session, Coolidge was more outspoken, though not in a leadership position.|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> {{is growing}} as {{acquisitions}} and mergers often under-perform expectations. This research {{looks at the}} literature on <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> to {{gain an understanding of}} the rationale for <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances,</b> organizational propensity to enter into <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> and their effect on sustainable competitive advantage. The methodology is qualitative, based on twelve case studies of organizations, with five out-performing the industry and five under-performing. The cases are structured around the value chain and modified grounded theory is used to analyze the data and to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} phenomenon. A wider range of reasons for entering alliances is substantiated and the theory concerning organizational propensity to enter into <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> is supported. <b>Strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> are being used to perform many value chain functions as organizations are lacking in both capabilities and resources.

40|$|<b>Strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly prominent in the global economy. Although many firms have realised benefits and expanded their businesses by using <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances,</b> others have encountered severe problems with such alliances; in some cases {{this has led to}} business failures. The contrasting results achieved by different firms in using <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> have attracted the attention of business practitioners and researchers. Through a literature review and case studies, the present study investigates the role of <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> in small trading firms. The research questions of this study address the following issues: &bull; What are the potential benefits of <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> to small trading firms? &bull; What are the key issues and problems facing small trading firms with regard to <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances?</b> &bull; What roles do <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> play in the business success or failure of small trading firms? &bull; How can small trading firms realise the potential benefits of <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> while simultaneously minimising the potential problems? The present study addresses these issues by exploring effective ways for partner firms to make best use of <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> in expanding their businesses. Six case studies are conducted on small trading firms in Australia; of these, three were successful in using <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> to expand their businesses, whereas the other three failed. The case studies draw upon documentary research of the files of the six firms and semi-structured interviews with alliance partners and managers involved in the formation and management of the <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> of the firms. By applying the theoretical perspectives of transaction cost, resource dependence, and strategic behaviour, a comparative cross-case analysis of the six case studies is conducted. The major finding of the present study is that a balanced portfolio approach to the formation and management of <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> holds the key to the business success of small trading firms. A &# 039;portfolio&# 039; consists of <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> in three categories-(i) product sourcing; (ii) product marketing; and (iii) business finance. The term &# 039;balance&# 039; refers to: (i) the significance of the alliance to the participants; (ii) the benefits to the participants; (iii) dependence among participants; and (iv) balance in the overall portfolio. The present research suggests that a balanced portfolio approach not only enables firms to achieve various benefits (such as consistent and competitive product supply, extended marketing channels, and sufficient funds to grow the businesses), but also reduces the occurrence of problems in <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> (such as undue dependence on the resources of partner firms). This thesis proposes practical recommendations for business practitioners to use in forming and managing <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> to expand their businesses. The thesis also proposes directions for future studies in strategic&shy; alliances research-such as research into the maintenance of an interdependent relationship within the alliance, dealing with crises in alliances, and the internal competencies required by a firm to manage a portfolio of alliances...|$|R

40|$|This {{longitudinal}} {{research study}} of the US bicycle industry from 1975 to 1994 and beyond examines the relationship between <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> and industry structures from a resource-based view of the firm. The main argument {{of this study is}} that <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> provide firms with flexible facilitating mechanisms to access strategic resources for competing in dynamic competitive environments. A theoretical framework outlines a reciprocal relationship between the creation of <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> and the development of an industry life cycle. Purposes for <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> arising from a transformation value chain are related to changes in industry structures as defined by different stages of an industry life cycle model. In order for a firm to sustain a competitive advantage as industry structures change, <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> facilitate a means for firm resources to be reconfigured accordingly or they may become core rigidities. ^ The following chapters develop the specifics for this research study. Chapter 1 introduces the rationales for studying <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> and industry structures from a resource based view. Chapter 2 reviews theoretical foundations and research findings on the resource based view of the firm, <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> and joint ventures, and the life cycle model. Chapter 3 draws from earlier research findings to develop a theoretical framework that outlines a dynamic relationship between <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> and industry structures. While <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> enable firms to adapt to environmental conditions, the cumulative impact of interfirm activities lead to shifts in life cycle stages. Chapter 4 outlines the case study research methodology and the selection of the bicycle industry for this empirical research study. ^ Chapter 5 presents the bicycle industry with detailed discussions of types of bicycles and component parts, demand and supply conditions of the US bicycle industry, bicycle firm behavior, <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> of bicycle firms, technological innovations, and the global bicycle industry. Chapter 6 discusses the case analysis of the bicycle industry by exploring the theoretical framework that was developed in Chapter 3. The results indicate that purposes for <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> differ during each stage of the bicycle industry 2 ̆ 7 s life cycle from 1975 to 1994 and beyond. An important role of <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> was to enable bicycle firms to reconfigure resources to protect the technical core of the organization and/or develop normal assets to leverage core competencies. To conclude, Chapter 7 outlines the contributions and limitation of this research study with future research directions. ...|$|R

40|$|Globalization {{of markets}} has opened many new {{opportunities}} for firms to reap profits through exploiting potential sources of economies of scope. In intensely-competitive global arenas, the firms should identify their skill and competency gaps and fill them rapidly. Each firm has specific/unique skills and resources. These, in turn, generate competency-gap filling potential through formation of <b>strategic</b> partnerships. <b>Strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> as manifestation of strategic partnerships have been flourishing {{for more than two}} decades and becoming preferable modes of transaction. <b>Strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> have therefore been emerging not only as optional modes, but also as the necessary ones. This paper examines antecedents of propensity of firms to enter into <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> in Indonesia. The focus of this research is on the influences of external characteristics (industry and environment characteristics) on the propensity of firms to enter into <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> using internal characteristics (firm characteristics) as a mediator. Path analysis is used to examine existence of effects. Structural models resulted from this research show as follows: Model 1 : Y = - 0. 006 X 1 + 0. 391 X 2 + 0. 394 Model 2 : Z = 0. 205 X 1 – 0. 104 X 2 + 0. 458 Y + 0. 171 Furthermore, research findings indicate that: 1. Environment characteristics significantly influence firm characteristics, but do not significantly influence the propensity of firms to enter into <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances.</b> 2. Industry characteristics significantly influence the propensity of firms to enter into <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances,</b> but do not significantly influence firms characteristics. 3.

40|$|TokyoThis article {{discusses}} {{management accounting}} for contractual <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances.</b> When two companies lack the enough managerial resources to individually implement their own objectives perfectly, <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> are adopted. Each company provides its own resources and conducts the business affairs in partnership to achieve both objectives {{at the same}} time. There are two characteristics of <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances.</b> The first characteristic of <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> {{is that there is}} not a master and servant relationship between two companies. So one company's objectives do not have any priority over the other's objectives. Moreover, <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> do not allow one company to pursue profits at the expense of the partner. The second characteristics is that the negotiation process is significant. The decision making process of <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances</b> is divided into five steps. This article discusses management accounting problems of the fifth step. In this step, companies negotiate the contents of <b>strategic</b> <b>alliances.</b> Profits will be divided according to the rate of managerial resources provided by each company. Therefore, the most important management accounting information is one which is associated with the allocation of managerial resources. I discuss the following four problems.
