5|$|At the park's visitor center, {{the group}} learns that the cloning was {{accomplished}} by extracting dinosaur DNA from mosquitoes that had been preserved in amber. DNA from frogs was used to fill in gaps in the dinosaur genomes. To prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female. Malcolm <b>scoffs</b> <b>at</b> the idea of such controlled breeding, declaring it will inevitably break down. The crew witness {{the birth of a}} baby raptor and visit the raptor enclosure. During a luncheon, the group debates the ethics of cloning and the creation of the park, with Dr. Malcolm giving a harsh warning about the implications of genetic engineering as a whole.|$|E
5|$|After Baby {{discovers that}} Johnny's dance partner, Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes), is {{pregnant}} by Robbie Gould (Max Cantor), a womanizing waiter {{who is also}} dating and cheating on Baby's older sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker) and several other female guests, she borrows money from her father {{to pay for an}} illegal abortion for Penny. Jake agrees to give the money to Baby even though she says she can't tell him what it's for. Penny eventually accepts the money, but says there is another issue. Johnny and Penny perform a weekly dance at the Sheldrake, another nearby resort. Penny will miss her performance if she goes for the abortion, and they will forfeit their salary for the season. Billy suggests that Baby fill in for her. Johnny <b>scoffs</b> <b>at</b> this, which overcomes Baby's initial resistance. Billy and Penny insist that Johnny can teach anyone to dance. Johnny begins to teach Baby the mambo, and the two spend several awkward practice sessions together. Baby gradually begins to improve, and a romantic attraction grows between them.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{is taken}} by Greg and Tamara through the jungle. Henry points out their unfounded trust in Peter Pan, a {{statement}} which begins to worry {{them when they}} discover the walkie-talkie they use {{to communicate with the}} Home Office is filled with sand. The Lost Boys soon find them, and reveal themselves to be the Home Office Greg and Tamara worked for, much to their displeasure. The leader of the Lost Boys, Felix, reveals that the plan was never to destroy magic, and that Greg and Tamara aren't meant to return to their world. The Shadow arrives and rips Greg's shadow from his body when he refuses to hand over Henry, and Tamara is shot with an arrow. Henry flees in the confusion, and is taken aside by a fellow runaway. The runaway reveals that he was a former Lost Boy, and stole pixie dust from Pan, hoping to escape from Neverland. However, he cannot make himself fly with it. Gold arrives {{at the scene of the}} skirmish, and finds Tamara still alive. She tells him that Henry ran, and that she and Greg had no idea that they were working for Pan. She also apologizes about Neal, but Gold crushes her heart. He and Felix meet in a clearing, with Felix welcoming Gold but warning him that if he is in Neverland for Henry, that makes him Pan's enemy. Rumpelstiltskin remarks that nothing has changed, and <b>scoffs</b> <b>at</b> the idea of his survival, only wanting to take down as many Lost Boys as he can before he dies. Felix responds by leaving behind a doll of a child, which reduces Rumpelstiltskin to tears.|$|E

500|$|The final {{number of}} the eight Teatro 10 episodes was [...] "Parole parole" [...] ("Words Words"), a duet with Alberto Lupo. The song is an easy {{listening}} dialogue between Mina's singing and Lupo's declamation. The lyrics' theme are hollow words. These intertwine the lady's lamentation {{of the end of}} love and the lies she has to hear with the male protagonist's recitation. In the dialog she <b>scoffs</b> <b>at</b> the compliments he gives her, calling them parole – just words. The single was released in April 1972 and topped the Italian charts. It was covered by numerous Italian and French duets.|$|E
500|$|Wall Street {{is not a}} {{wholesale}} criticism of capitalism, but of the cynical, quick-buck culture of the 1980s. The [...] "good" [...] characters in the film are themselves capitalists, but in a more steady, hardworking sense. In one scene, Gekko <b>scoffs</b> <b>at</b> Bud Fox's question as to the moral value of hard work, quoting the example of his (Gekko's) father, who worked hard his entire life only to die in debt. Lou Mannheim, the film's archetypal mentor, says early in the film, that [...] "good things sometimes take time", referring to IBM and Hilton—in contrast, Gekko's [...] "Greed is Good" [...] credo typifies the short-term view prevalent in the 1980s.|$|E

As a young prostitute, she emigrates to the Virginia Colony in North America and becomes independently wealthy but also contracts a fatal case of syphilis. By 1609, Darla lies dying in the luxurious house she owns. She <b>scoffs</b> <b>at</b> a [...] "priest" [...] who comes to her deathbed before he reveals his true identity: the Master, leader of an elite cult of vampires known as the Order of Aurelius. Darla despises the clergy and religion, a trait that follows her as a vampire. The Master turns her into a vampire and renames her [...] "Darla," [...] meaning [...] "dear one" [...] in early modern English ("darling").|$|E

However, she is forced to bring Tina inside to prevent her from fainting. Meanwhile, Gene impresses the judges with a magic-themed table display and {{advances}} to the top four. Having not fully read the competition rule book, however, he is left unprepared to produce a second table display for the next round. The concert begins before Louise can exit, and she remains unimpressed until the band's prepubescent youngest member, Boo Boo, comes onstage. Louise is left frozen in awe by his looks, and once the band's first song starts she starts excitedly screaming out his name. Horrified at what she has done, she runs out in denial about liking Boo Boo, having never had a previous crush.|$|E

Wallace gives Veronica the student file on one of the two students, but his high school records are clean after bullying in junior high. The other student doesn't have a file. Veronica talks to Duncan, who says he knows about her investigation. Duncan <b>scoffs</b> <b>at</b> her findings before he realizes that she suspects him in the murder, reacting with extreme rage before dashing out of the room. Ben and Norris talk about guns and bombs, leading Veronica to track Ben, eventually seeing him buying fertilizer and taking out a rifle. Ben gets into the car and orders her to drive to the Camelot motel. There, Logan appears and beats him up before it is revealed that the [...] "suspect" [...] is actually an ATF agent. Ben says that he is investigating Norris, but needs her help: Norris has a crush on Veronica, and Ben asks her to get close to him. As she leaves the motel, Veronica and Logan kiss unexpectedly.|$|E

His son Michael serves as manager of the company, and, after being passed over for a promotion, decides to leave both the company and his family. Just as he makes this decision, however, George Sr. is arrested by the Securities and Exchange Commission for defrauding investors and gross spending of the company's money for [...] "personal expenses". His wife Lucille becomes CEO, and immediately names as the new president her extremely sheltered youngest son Buster, who proves ill-equipped, as his only experience with business is a class he took concerning 18th century agrarian business. Furious at being passed over again, Michael secures another job with a rival company and plans on leaving his family behind for good. Realizing that they need Michael, the family asks him to come back and run the company, which Michael <b>scoffs</b> <b>at</b> until he sees how much the family means to his teenaged son George Michael. To keep the family together, Michael asks his self-centered twin sister Lindsay, her husband Tobias and their daughter Maeby to live together in the Bluth model home with him and George Michael.|$|E

[...] Soon, they find Brauner's channeler, a Dullahan. [...] Shortly after its defeat, one of the vampire sisters appears and disdains their efforts, saying their control is lessened in only a minor degree. [...] Later, when {{entering}} the second portrait, they find Brauner and the two twins; Brauner laughs {{at the notion of}} reviving Dracula, as he has failed too many times to control humanity, but concedes his power is too great to ignore. [...] Both sisters desire to kill the two humans, but Brauner sees Dracula's servant Death as a greater threat, as he could wrest control from him far more easily than them. [...] While exploring the castle, Charlotte and Jonathan encounter Death, who acts as if Dracula were already revived. [...] When informed Dracula is still dead, and that another vampire is controlling the castle, he <b>scoffs</b> <b>at</b> the idea of a hand other than Dracula's to rule Castlevania.

Lisa wants the tea but Homer, <b>scoffs</b> <b>at</b> the tea and demands the antacids. While leaving the office Lisa {{has had enough}} and snaps at her father for belittling everything she believes in. When Lisa sees how she upset him, she says that they are just too different and will eventually drift apart. To make things up to her, Homer takes her to a local New Age store which introduces Homer and Lisa to water-filled sensory deprivation tanks, where they experience their own spiritual journey. On her journey, Lisa sees herself from Homer's perspective, reprimanding him for snoring during a ballet recital. Lisa realizes that despite his boorish personality, Homer loves Lisa enough {{to take her to}} events and places that he does not personally like just so she can be happy. Meanwhile, a pair of repo men start to clean out the store despite the lease not being up for months, taking the tank that Homer is in. Homer's [...] "journey" [...] becomes a real one, as his tank falls {{out of the back of}} the van. Mistaken by the Flanders' as a coffin, they bury him, only for the tank to fall through the soil and into a pipe where it is washed up onto the beach. Chief Wiggum finds it and returns it to the store. Lisa decides to go and do something they both enjoy. But they end up at a demolition derby together, even though Homer is the only fan.|$|E

Keyes does not suspect foul play at first, but his instincts, {{to which he}} refers as the [...] "little man", pointing to his stomach, starts nagging. He wonders why Dietrichson did not file a claim for his broken leg, and deduces {{he did not know}} about the policy. Keyes tells Neff of his theory outside Neff's apartment, while Phyllis hides behind the door. Keyes soon concludes that Phyllis and some unknown accomplice murdered Dietrichson for the insurance money, but needs more proof.|$|E

Williamson catches Levene's slip of the tongue and compels Levene to admit that he broke into the office. Levene finally caves in and admits that he and Moss conspired to steal the leads. Levene attempts to bribe Williamson to keep quiet about the burglary. Williamson <b>scoffs</b> <b>at</b> the suggestion and tells Levene that the buyers to whom he had made his sale earlier that day are in fact bankrupt and delusional and just enjoy talking to salesmen. Levene, crushed by this revelation, asks Williamson why he seeks to ruin him. Williamson coldly responds, [...] "Because I don't like you." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Devil {{is nearly}} indestructible, and <b>scoffs</b> <b>at</b> {{the idea that}} he could be {{contained}} within a Solomon's cage (which can confine the strongest demon). He also has superhuman strength, having tricked and placed Sam once in a painful arm-hold to interrogate him. However, the Devil can be affected by angelic relics, as he can be killed by the Sword of the Archangel Michael (which he has in safekeeping), and could be [...] "destroyed" [...] if the whole world were to turn to pacifism (as Sam deduced after the Devil's near-annihilation of a demon rebellion, as if the Devil couldn't tempt others with sin, he would cease to exist - although the Devil notes that all humanity adopting complete pacifism would be nearly impossible). In addition, the Devil cannot see, hear, or appear within curves or circles, although he can be summoned within a circle. He holds no influence over true love, which may be attributed to his belief that humans are incapable of experiencing it. The Devil also confesses that even though he tried to overthrow God, he still loved Him when Sam asked the Devil about love. He confesses to Sam that God loves us all no matter what we are.|$|E
2500|$|For her {{performance}} as the house slave who repeatedly scolds her owner's daughter, Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), and <b>scoffs</b> <b>at</b> Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), McDaniel won the 1939 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first black American to win an Oscar. She {{was the first black}} American to have been nominated. [...] "I loved Mammy," [...] McDaniel said when speaking to the white press about the character. [...] "I think I understood her because my own grandmother worked on a plantation not unlike Tara." [...] Her role in Gone with the Wind had alarmed some whites in the South; there were complaints that in the film she had been too [...] "familiar" [...] with her white owners. At least one writer pointed out that McDaniel's character did not significantly depart from Mammy's persona in Margaret Mitchell's novel, and that in both the film and the book, the much younger Scarlett speaks to Mammy in ways that would be deemed inappropriate for a Southern teenager of that era to speak to a much older white person, and that neither the book nor the film hints of the existence of Mammy's own children (dead or alive), her own family (dead or alive), a real name, or her desires to have anything other than a life at Tara, serving on a slave plantation. Moreover, while Mammy scolds the younger Scarlett, she never crosses Mrs. O'Hara, the more senior white woman in the household. Some critics felt that McDaniel not only accepted the roles but also in her statements to the press acquiesced in Hollywood's stereotypes, providing fuel for critics of those who were fighting for black civil rights. Later, when McDaniel tried to take her [...] "Mammy" [...] character on a road show, black audiences did not prove receptive.|$|E
2500|$|Though Quan Chi was {{not part}} of the first {{generation}} of Mortal Kombat fighting games, he was the only playable character from the three-dimensional era included in both the storyline and immediate roster of Mortal Kombat (2011), the reboot of the continuity of the first three titles. In the game's story mode, he first appears at the start of the Shaolin Tournament with the resurrected Scorpion serving as his personal assassin. Scorpion has entered the tournament to seek revenge against Sub-Zero, whom he believes slaughtered his family and clan. Raiden, in his effort to prevent Armageddon (as seen in the game's opening sequence), convinces Scorpion not to kill Sub-Zero after defeating him in combat in the Netherealm, but it goes for naught after Quan Chi manipulates Scorpion into the deed by showing a graphic vision of the Lin Kuei's murder of Scorpion's clan and then his wife and child. He and Scorpion join forces in the tournament to face Liu Kang, but both are defeated. During the second tournament in Shao Kahn's arena in Outworld, Quan Chi refers to himself and Shang Tsung as a [...] "deadly alliance" [...] when they team up to battle Kung Lao (and are beaten). In the retold events of Mortal Kombat 3, he revives the deceased Queen Sindel in order to enable Kahn to invade Earthrealm, in addition to having resurrected Sub-Zero as Noob Saibot, who assists him in his plans. With Quan Chi entrenched as Kahn's second-in-command, Kahn eliminates Shang Tsung and transfers his powers to Sindel, while Quan Chi constructs a Soulnado (a magical twister built from souls trapped in limbo between Earthrealm and Outworld) in a graveyard with the objective of taking every soul on Earth. However, Nightwolf defeats Quan Chi in battle and kicks Noob Saibot into the Soulnado, destroying it, but Quan Chi escapes. After Sindel massacres the Earth warriors who had assembled to stop Kahn's takeover, Raiden seeks cooperation between Earth and the Netherealm and offers Quan Chi their souls as compensation, but Quan Chi has already acquired them, which Raiden then combats and defeats in succession. Quan Chi then inadvertently causes Raiden to have an epiphany when he <b>scoffs</b> <b>at</b> Raiden's claim that the Elder Gods are obligated to prohibit Shao Kahn from taking over Earthrealm; Raiden then realizes that Kahn must merge Earth and Outworld in order to prevent Armageddon, which would in turn force Kahn to face judgment for doing so without victory in Mortal Kombat. When Kahn is finally killed by Raiden in a brutal fight, Earthrealm lies in ruins, and Quan Chi appears at the conclusion with Shinnok, disdainfully picking up the remains of Kahn's helmet while declaring that Shinnok's plan [...] "worked to perfection", which involves Shinnok and Quan Chi spearheading the Netherealm's impending invasion of the weakened Earth and Outworld.|$|E
