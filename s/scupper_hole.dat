60|$|He unstrapped {{the machine}} from his wrist {{to examine it}} better, and while holding it {{carelessly}} in his hand it slipped and fell with a bang to the deck, striking upon its round edge and rolling quickly past the cabin and out of sight. With a cry of alarm he ran after it, and after much search found it lying against the bulwark {{near the edge of}} a <b>scupper</b> <b>hole,</b> where the least jar of the ship would have sent it {{to the bottom of the}} ocean. Rob hastily seized his treasure and upon examining it found the fall had bulged the rim so that the old dents scarcely showed at all. But its original shape was more distorted than ever, and Rob feared he had utterly ruined its delicate mechanism. Should this prove to be true, he might now consider himself a prisoner of this piratical band, the members of which, although temporarily disabled, would soon regain consciousness.|$|E
60|$|Even Bob {{could feel}} {{how much the}} brig was relieved, when the {{pressure}} of the topsail was taken off. The lower planks of the deck rose from the water and, although this still rushed in and out through the <b>scupper</b> <b>holes,</b> and rose at times {{to the level of the}} bulwark rail, he felt that the worst was over.|$|R
60|$|Well, while things stood thus, {{suddenly}} the HISPANIOLA struck, staggered, ground {{for an instant}} in the sand, and then, swift as a blow, canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle of forty-five degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the <b>scupper</b> <b>holes</b> and lay, in a pool, between the deck and bulwark.|$|R
60|$|We {{were still}} on the Banks, when a terrific storm came down upon us, the like of which I had never before beheld, or imagined. The rain poured down in sheets and cascades; the <b>scupper</b> <b>holes</b> could hardly carry it off the decks; and in bracing the yards we waded about almost up to our knees; every thing {{floating}} about, like chips in a dock.|$|R
50|$|Three main {{factors were}} {{attributed}} to the sinking of London by the subsequent enquiry by the Board of Trade: firstly, the decision by Captain Martin to return to Plymouth, as it is believed the ship had passed {{the worst of the}} weather conditions and by turning back the London re-entered the storm; secondly, the ship was overloaded with 345 tons of railway iron; and finally, the 50 tons of coal which was stored above deck, which after the decks were washed by waves blocked the <b>scupper</b> <b>holes,</b> which prevented drainage of the seawater.|$|R
50|$|C.I.Agent Solutions {{de-watering}} and filtration {{products for}} the marine industry are centered on bilge water filtration. The Bilge Pillows and De-watering Bags remove hydrocarbon contaminants from the bilge of a vessel, and can then be disposed of in traditional non-hazardous waste collections. C.I.Agent Barge Scupper allows water to freely flow through the <b>scupper</b> <b>holes</b> while permanently capturing pollutants in a layer of C.I.Agent. The C.I.Agent Sheen Machine is designed for use on water with strong current or to be towed in open water. It guides the oil sheen floating on top of water through the device, where the sheen is captured by C.I.Agent material inside the filtration bag.|$|R
