One major cost incurred {{by the company}} in 1992 was the restructuring of its Brazilian subsidiary, a downsizing made necessary by the phenomenal rate of inflation and general instability of the Brazilian economy. A new plant was built in Korea in 1992, {{making it possible to}} offer a broader range of products in the growing Asian market. Among NCH's acquisitions that year was a line of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>flexible</b> tubing connectors. These new products were marketed under the trade name Aqua-Flo. By the end of fiscal 1992, NCH's plumbing group was offering a total of more than 80,000 different parts. The Resource Electronics group's line had grown to over 40,000 parts by this time as well. The company also expanded its line of retail products, which by this time included Outright brand pet care products, Out! International pet odor eliminators, and Totally Toddler nursery care items.

We report here on a new method of implantation for studying the visual system of freely moving rats that provides a rat model for simultaneous recording at corneal and cortical level and is stable enough to record for months. We implanted light emitting diodes onto the skull behind the eyeball to stimulate the eye with flashes and to light adapt the retina with constant light levels. A multistrand, <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> <b>flexible</b> fine wire electrode placed on the eyeball was used for electroretinogram recording and screw electrodes (left/right visual and parietal cortical) were used to record the visual evoked potential and the electroencephalogram. In the present report we focus on the new method of implantation for recording the corneal flash electroretinogram of normal, freely moving rats simultaneously with the visual evoked cortical potential showing examples in various visual experiments. We also introduce a program for retinogram and visual evoked potential analysis, which defines various measures (latencies, areas, amplitudes, and durations) and draw attention to the benefits of this method for those involved in visual, functional genomic, pharmacological, and human ophthalmologic research...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Flexible {{intramedullary}} nailing {{has emerged}} as an accepted procedure for paediatric femoral fractures. Present indications include all patients with femoral shaft fractures and open physis. Despite its excellent reported results, orthopaedic surgeons remain divided in opinion regarding its usefulness and the best material used for nails. We thus undertook a retrospective study of paediatric femoral fractures treated with titanium or <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>flexible</b> nails at our institute {{with a minimum of}} 5 years follow up. Material and methods We included 73 femoral shaft fractures in 69 patients treated with retrograde flexible intramedullary nailing with a minimum follow up of 5 years. Final limb length discrepancy and any angular or rotational deformities were determined. Results Mean age at final follow up was 15. 5 years (10 - 21 years). Mean follow up was 7. 16 years (5. 0 - 8. 6 years). Titanium and stainless steel nails were used in 43 and 30 cases respectively. There were 51 midshaft, 17 proximal, and 5 distal fractures. All fractures united at an average of 11 weeks but asymptomatic malalignment and LLD were seen in 19 % and 58 % fractures respectively. LLD ranged from - 3 cm to 1. 5 cm. Other complications included superficial infection(2), proximal migration of nail(3), irritation at nail insertion site(5) and penetration of femoral neck with nail tip(1). There were 59 excellent, 10 satisfactory and 4 poor results. Conclusion Flexible intramedullary nailing is reliable and safe for treating paediatric femoral shaft fractures. It is relatively free of serious complications despite asymptomatic malalignment and LLD in significant percentage of fractures. </p...|$|E

The isolators employed in rearing were constructed of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and <b>flexible</b> plastic film.

Tissues, body fluids, and cecal contents of piglets sacrificed specifically for microbiological examination were also negative for PPLO, viruses, bacteria, yeast, and fungi. Prenatal infestations by ascarids were not observed. Nutritional problems related to rearing of germ-free piglets, such as hypoglycemia, were not encountered, and the use of an autoclaved commercial sow's milk replacer proved quite satisfactory.
