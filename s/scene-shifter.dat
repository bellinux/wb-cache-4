2500|$|Not much {{is known}} about Titus Maccius Plautus' early life. It is {{believed}} that {{he was born in}} Sarsina, a small town in Emilia Romagna in northern Italy, in around 254 BC. According to Morris Marples, Plautus worked as a stage-carpenter or <b>scene-shifter</b> in his early years. It is from this work, perhaps, that his love of the theater originated. His acting talent was eventually discovered; and he adopted the names [...] "Maccius" [...] (a clownish stock-character in popular farces) and [...] "Plautus" [...] (a term meaning either [...] "flat-footed" [...] or [...] "flat-eared", like the ears of a hound). [...] Tradition holds that he made enough money to go into the nautical business, but that the venture collapsed. He is then said to have worked as a manual laborer and to have studied Greek drama—particularly the New Comedy of Menander—in his leisure. His studies allowed him to produce his plays, which were released between c. 205 and 184 BC. Plautus attained such a popularity that his name alone became a hallmark of theatrical success.|$|E

60|$|Here my {{habitual}} composure in {{the face}} of danger stood me in good stead. It enabled me to walk composedly and not too hurriedly through the crowd behind the scenes--supers, <b>scene-shifters,</b> principals, none of whom seemed to be aware as yet of the hoax practised on Mademoiselle Mars' maid; and I reckon that I was out of the stage door exactly five minutes after Theodore had called the damsel away.|$|R
60|$|The next {{performance}} of Le Rêve was announced {{for the following}} evening, and I started on my campaign. As you may imagine, it did not prove an easy matter.

60|$|Through devious {{passages}} {{beneath the}} theatre, Hugh led the way, while with greater poignancy {{than ever before}} the young playwright sensed the vulgarity, the immodesty, and the dirt of the world behind and below the scenes. It was all familiar enough to him, for he had several friends among the actors, {{but the thought of}} one so sovereign as Helen {{in the midst of a}} region so squalid stung him. He was jealous of the actors, the <b>scene-shifters,</b> who were permitted to see her come and go.|$|R
60|$|Payment {{will not}} be made, as at present, only for work {{actually}} required and performed, but for willingness to work. This system is already adopted {{in much of the}} better paid work: a man occupies a certain position, and retains it even at times when there happens to be very little to do. The dread of unemployment and loss of livelihood will no longer haunt men like a nightmare. Whether all who are willing to work will be paid equally, or whether exceptional skill will still command exceptional pay, is a matter which may be left to each guild to decide for itself. An opera-singer who received no more pay than a <b>scene-shifter</b> might choose to be a <b>scene-shifter</b> until the system was changed: if so, higher pay would probably be found necessary. But if it were freely voted by the Guild, it could hardly constitute a grievance.|$|E

60|$|All {{was ready}} now; and Christmas Day was much enlivened by last rehearsals, the panics of timid actors, the {{scramble}} for forgotten properties, and {{the decoration of}} the theatre. Evergreen and holly from the woods, blooming plants from the hothouse on Parnassus, and flags of all nations made it very gay that night in honour of the guests who were coming, chief among them, Miss Cameron, who kept her promise faithfully. The orchestra tuned their instruments with unusual care, the <b>scene-shifters</b> set their stage with lavish elegance, the prompter heroically took his seat in the stifling nook provided for him, and the actors dressed with trembling hands that dropped the pins, and perspiring brows whereon the powder wouldn't stick. Beaumont and Fletcher were everywhere, feeling that their literary reputation was at stake; for sundry friendly critics were invited, and reporters, like mosquitoes, cannot be excluded from any earthly scene, be it a great man's death-bed or a dime museum.|$|R
60|$|I {{am afraid}} {{you will find}} me, my Lord, again falling into my usual vanity, in valuing myself on the eminent men whose society I once enjoyed. I remember, in a {{conversation}} I once had with my ever dear friend Garrick, {{who was the first}} of actors, because he was the most acute observer of Nature I ever knew, I asked him how it happened, that, whenever a senate appeared on the stage, the audience seemed always disposed to laughter. He said, the reason was plain: the audience was well acquainted with the faces of most of the senators. They knew that they were no other than candle-snuffers, revolutionary <b>scene-shifters,</b> second and third mob, prompters, clerks, executioners, who stand with their axe on their shoulders by the wheel, grinners in the pantomime, murderers in tragedies, who make ugly faces under black wigs,--in short, the very scum and refuse of the theatre; and it was of course that the contrast of the vileness of the actors with the pomp of their habits naturally excited ideas of contempt and ridicule.|$|R
6000|$|I am in {{the habit}} of taking my papers to Dilke's and copying there; so I chat and proceed at the same time. I have been there at my work this evening, and the walk over the Heath takes off all sleep, so I will even proceed with you. I left off short in my last just as I began an account of a private theatrical--Well it was of the lowest order, all greasy and oily, insomuch that if they had lived in olden times, when signs were hung over the doors, the only {{appropriate}} one for that oily place would have been--a guttered Candle. They played John Bull, The Review, and it was to conclude with Bombastes Furioso--I saw from a Box the first Act of John Bull, then went to Drury and did not return till it was over--when by Wells's interest we got behind the scenes--there was not a yard wide all the way round for actors, <b>scene-shifters,</b> and interlopers to move in--for 'Nota Bene' the Green Room was under the stage, and there was I threatened over and over again to be turned out by the oily <b>scene-shifters,</b> there did I hear a little painted Trollop own, very candidly, that she had failed in Mary, with a [...] "damn'd if she'd play a serious part again, as long as she lived," [...] {{and at the same time}} she was habited as the Quaker in the Review.--There was a quarrel, and a fat good-natured looking girl in soldiers' clothes wished she had only been a man for Tom's sake. One fellow began a song, but an unlucky finger-point from the Gallery sent him off like a shot. One chap was dressed to kill for the King in Bombastes, and he stood at the edge of the scene in the very sweat of anxiety to show himself, but Alas the thing was not played. The sweetest morsel of the night moreover was, that the musicians began pegging and fagging away--at an overture--never did you see faces more in earnest, three times did they play it over, dropping all kinds of corrections and still did not the curtain go up. Well then they went into a country dance, then into a region they well knew, into the old boonsome Pothouse, and then to see how pompous o' the sudden they turned; how they looked about and chatted; how they did not care a damn; was a great treat---- ...|$|R
60|$|Ten {{minutes after}} {{the rise of the}} curtain on the fourth act I was in the dressing-room, {{presenting}} the maid with a gold locket which I had bought from a cheapjack's barrow for five and twenty francs--almost the last of the fifty which I had received from M. Duval on account. The damsel was eyeing the locket somewhat disdainfully and giving me grudging thanks for it when there came a hurried knock at the door. The next moment Theodore poked his ugly face into the room. He, too, had taken the precaution of assuming an excellent disguise--peaked cap set aslant over one eye, grimy face, the blouse of a <b>scene-shifter.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "There was a fellow, a noisy blackguard, whom Briggs {{was asking}} after this very summer--a fellow who went off from Whitbury with some players. I know Briggs {{used to go}} to the theatre with him as a boy--what was his name? He tried acting, but did not succeed; and then became a <b>scene-shifter,</b> or {{something}} of the kind, at the Adelphi. He has some complaint, I forget what, which made him an out-patient at St. Mumpsimus's, some months every year. I know that he was there this summer, for I wrote to ask, at Briggs's request, and Briggs sent him a sovereign through me." ...|$|E
60|$|In fact, at {{this very}} moment our <b>scene-shifter</b> changes the picture. Away rolls the image of Mrs. Kittridge's kitchen, with its sanded floor, its scoured rows of bright pewter platters, its great, deep fireplace, with wide stone hearth, its little looking-glass with a bit of {{asparagus}} bush, like a green mist, over it. Exeunt the image of Mrs. Kittridge, with her hands floury from the bread she has been moulding, and the dry, ropy, lean Captain, who has been sitting tilting back in a splint-bottomed chair,--and the next scene comes rolling in. It is a chamber in the house of Zephaniah Pennel, whose windows present a blue panorama of sea and sky. Through two windows you look forth into the blue belt of Harpswell Bay, bordered on the farther edge by Harpswell Neck, dotted here and there with houses, among which rises the little white meeting-house, like a mother-bird among a flock of chickens. The third window, {{on the other side of}} the room, looks far out to sea, where only a group of low, rocky islands interrupts the clear sweep of the horizon line, with its blue infinitude of distance.|$|E
40|$|Czech theater {{director}} Alfred Radok (1914 - 1976) {{was always}} temped by confronting {{several layers of}} meaning in one single work of art. On theater he used different scenic spaces at once - in e. g. his production of Offenbach's opera Hoffman's Tales (Velka opera 5. kvetna IThe Great May 5 th Opera/, 1946) he combined two spaces which symbolized the two worlds of Hoffman's fantasy. The true character of these worlds was not only formed by the stage design but also by acting. When transiting from one space to the other the actors changed their gestures, their body language, the way they walked, etc. A similar principle was applied in Verdi's Rigoletto (Velka opera 5. kvetna IThe Great May 5 th Operal, 1947). In this production the singers were moving inbetween two different worlds - one being represented by a ceremonial opening night of this performance in Teatro La Fenice, while the second by the theater backstage which unveiled the reverse side of fame (<b>scene-shifters</b> were preparing the change of the upcoming scene, one singer was flirting around with the dancers, prop-woman was knitting etc.).

60|$|One {{night at}} the little theatre in Padua, the ticket-seller gave us the {{stage-box}} (of which he made a great merit), and so we saw the play and the byplay. The prompter, as noted {{from our point of}} view, bore a chief part in the drama (as indeed the prompter always does in the Italian theatre), and the <b>scene-shifters</b> appeared as prominent characters. We could not help seeing the virtuous wife, when hotly pursued by the villain of the piece, pause calmly in the wings, before rushing, all tears and desperation, upon the stage; and we were dismayed to behold the injured husband and his abandoned foe playfully scuffling behind the scenes. All the shabbiness of the theatre was perfectly apparent to us; we saw the grossness of the painting and the unreality of the properties. And yet I cannot say that the play lost one whit of its charm for me, or that the working of the machinery and its inevitable clumsiness disturbed my enjoyment in the least. There was so much truth and beauty in the playing, that I did not care for the sham of the ropes and gilding, and presently ceased to take any note of them. The illusion which I had thought an essential in the dramatic spectacle, {{turned out to be a}} condition of small importance.|$|R
60|$|The Emperor {{was like}} most of his innumerable pictures, with a swarthy face from which his blue eyes glanced pleasantly; he looked good-humored if not good-natured; the Empress smiled amiably beneath her deeply fringed white parasol, and they both bowed right and left in {{acknowledgment}} of those hollow groans; but again it seemed, to March that sovereignty, gave the popular curiosity, not to call it devotion, a scantier return than it merited. He had perhaps been insensibly working toward some such perception as now came {{to him that the}} great difference between Europe and America was that in Europe life is histrionic and dramatized, and that in America, except when it is trying to be European, it is direct and sincere. He wondered whether the innate conviction of equality, the deep, underlying sense of a common humanity transcending all social and civic pretences, was what gave their theatrical effect to the shows of deference from low to high, and of condescension from high to low. If in such encounters of sovereigns and subjects, the prince did not play his part so well as the people, it might be that he had a harder part to play, and that to support his dignity at all, to keep from being found out the sham that he essentially was, he had to hurry across the stage amidst the distracting thunders of the orchestra. If the star staid to be scrutinized by the soldiers, citizens, and so forth, even the poor supernumeraries and <b>scene-shifters</b> might see that he was a tallow candle like themselves.|$|R

60|$|Father Brown, {{though he}} knew every detail done behind the scenes, and had even evoked applause by his {{transformation}} of a pillow into a pantomime baby, went round {{to the front and}} sat among the audience with all the solemn expectation of a child at his first matinee. The spectators were few, relations, one or two local friends, and the servants; Sir Leopold sat in the front seat, his full and still fur-collared figure largely obscuring the view of the little cleric behind him; but it has never been settled by artistic authorities whether the cleric lost much. The pantomime was utterly chaotic, yet not contemptible; there ran through it a rage of improvisation which came chiefly from Crook the clown. Commonly he was a clever man, and he was inspired tonight with a wild omniscience, a folly wiser than the world, that which comes to a young man who has seen for an instant a particular expression on a particular face. He {{was supposed to be the}} clown, but he was really almost everything else, the author (so far as there was an author), the prompter, the scene-painter, the <b>scene-shifter,</b> and, above all, the orchestra. At abrupt intervals in the outrageous performance he would hurl himself in full costume at the piano and bang out some popular music equally absurd and appropriate.|$|E
60|$|The <b>Scene-shifter</b> saw fit here {{to close}} the drama, of this day, without regard to any unities which we mortals prize. Whether it might have proved tragedy, or comedy, or tragi-comedy, or pastoral, we cannot tell. This Sunday ended by the going down of the sun, leaving us still on the waves. But they {{who are on the}} water enjoy a longer and {{brighter}} twilight than they who are on the land, for here the water, as well as the atmosphere, absorbs and reflects the light, and some of the day seems to have sunk down into the waves. The light gradually forsook the deep water, as well as the deeper air, and the gloaming came to the fishes as well as to us, and more dim and gloomy to them, whose day is a perpetual twilight, though sufficiently bright for their weak and watery eyes. Vespers had already rung in many a dim and watery chapel down below, where the shadows of the weeds were extended in length over the sandy floor. The vespertinal pout had already begun to flit on leathern fin, and the finny gossips withdrew from the fluvial street to creeks and coves, and other private haunts, excepting a few of stronger fin, which anchored in the stream, stemming the tide even in their dreams. Meanwhile, like a dark evening cloud, we were wafted over the cope of their sky, deepening the shadows on their deluged fields.|$|E
6000|$|Lucerne, September. --Berne, I find, {{has been}} filling with {{tourists}} {{at the expense}} of Lucerne, which I have been having almost to myself. There are six people at the table d'hôte; the excellent dinner denotes {{on the part of the}} chef the easy leisure in which true artists love to work. The waiters have nothing to do but lounge about the hall and chink in their pockets the fees of the past season. The day has been lovely in itself, and pervaded, to my sense, by the gentle glow of a natural satisfaction at my finding myself again on the threshold of Italy. I am lodged en prince, in a room with a balcony hanging over the lake--a balcony on which I spent a long time this morning at dawn, thanking the mountain-tops, from the depths of a landscape-lover's heart, for their promise of superbly fair weather. There were a great many mountain-tops to thank, for the crags and peaks and pinnacles tumbled away through the morning mist in an endless confusion of grandeur. I have been all day in better humour with Lucerne than ever before--a forecast reflection of Italian moods. If Switzerland, as I wrote the other day, is so furiously a show-place, Lucerne is certainly one of the biggest booths at the fair. The little quay, under the trees, squeezed in between the decks of the steamboats and the doors of the hotels, is a terrible medley of Saxon dialects--a jumble of pilgrims in all the phases of devotion, equipped with book and staff, alpenstock and Baedeker. There are so many hotels and trinket-shops, so many omnibuses and steamers, so many Saint- Gothard vetturini, so many ragged urchins poking photographs, minerals and Lucernese English at you, that you feel as if lake and mountains themselves, in all their loveliness, were but a part of the [...] "enterprise" [...] of landlords and pedlars, and half expect to see the Righi and Pilatus and the fine weather figure as items on your hotel-bill between the bougie and the siphon. Nature herself assists you to this conceit; there is something so operatic and suggestive of footlights and <b>scene-shifters</b> in the view on which Lucerne looks out. You are one of five thousand--fifty thousand--"accommodated" [...] spectators; you have taken your season-ticket and there is a responsible impresario somewhere behind the scenes. There is such a luxury of beauty in the prospect--such a redundancy of composition and effect--so many more peaks and pinnacles than are needed to make one heart happy or regale the vision of one quiet observer, that you finally accept the little Babel on the quay and the looming masses in the clouds as equal parts of a perfect system, and feel as if the mountains had been waiting so many ages for the hotels to come and balance the colossal group, that they show a right, after all, to have them big and numerous. The <b>scene-shifters</b> have been at work all day long, composing and discomposing the beautiful background of the prospect--massing the clouds and scattering the light, effacing and reviving, making play with their wonderful machinery of mist and haze. The mountains rise, one behind the other, in an enchanting gradation of distances and of melting blues and greys; you think each successive tone the loveliest and haziest possible till you see another loom dimly behind it. I couldn't enjoy even The Swiss Times, over my breakfast, till I had marched forth to the office of the Saint- Gothard service of coaches and demanded the banquette for to- morrow. The one place at the disposal of the office was taken, but I might possibly m'entendre with the conductor for his own seat--the conductor being generally visible, in the intervals of business, at the post-office. To the post-office, after breakfast, I repaired, over the fine new bridge which now spans the green Reuss and gives such a woeful air of country-cousinship to the crooked old wooden structure which did sole service when I was here four years ago. The old bridge is covered with a running hood of shingles and adorned with a series of very quaint and vivid little paintings of the [...] "Dance of Death," [...] quite in the Holbein manner; the new sends up a painful glare from its white limestone, and is ornamented with candelabra in a meretricious imitation of platinum. As an almost professional cherisher of the quaint I ought to have chosen to return at least by the dark and narrow way; but mark how luxury unmans us. I was already demoralised. I crossed the threshold of the timbered portal, took a few steps, and retreated. It smelt badly! So I marched back, counting the lamps in their fine falsity. But the other, the crooked and covered way, smelt very badly indeed; and no good American is without a fund of accumulated sensibility to the odour of stale timber.|$|R

All went smoothly; and the capricious Marquise, after tormenting the devoted Baron to her heart's content, owned herself conquered in the war of wits, and was just offering the hand he had fairly won, when a crash startled them, and a heavily decorated side-scene swayed forward, ready to fall upon Alice. Demi saw it and sprung before her to catch and hold it up, standing like a modern Samson with the wall of a house on his back. The danger was over in a moment, and he was about to utter his last speech, when the excited young <b>scene-shifter,</b> who had flown up a ladder to repair the damage, leaned over to whisper 'All right', and release Demi from his spread-eagle attitude: as he did so, a hammer slipped out of his pocket, to fall upon the upturned face below, inflicting a smart blow and literally knocking the Baron's part out of his head.|$|E

While Christine is alone, she sings from the tattered parchment and blood seeps from the notes and covers her hands. Shocked, she discovers this to be an illusion when Meg returns. Christine auditions with the piece and during her performance, an accident with a falling sandbag renders her unconscious and shatters a mirror. She awakens in London in 1881, wearing opera clothing. A different version of Meg (Emma Rawson) is also there. Christine {{turns out to be the}} understudy to the diva La Carlotta (Stephanie Lawrence), who is both jealous and resentful of Christine’s skill. During this whole time, Erik Destler (Robert Englund) attacks the <b>scene-shifter</b> Joseph (Terence Beesley) with a blade high above the rafters for almost killing Christine with the falling sandbag, and blaming the accident on him.|$|E
50|$|Born in Fallowfield, Manchester, Goodwin {{was the son}} of a {{bookmaker}} {{and grew}} up in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester. After being drafted into the RAF in 1943, Goodwin's initial photography experience was loading cameras in reconnaissance planes flying over Japanese Territory in Burma. When his unit moved to Kuala Lumpur he borrowed the equipment to take photographs of the local girls to sell to his comrades. After the war ended he returned to Manchester and began taking pictures professionally on the beauty pageant and boxing circuits. His first celebrity subject was comedian Ken Dodd. In the 1960s a job as a <b>scene-shifter</b> at the BBC's Manchester Studios gave him the opportunity to shoot television personalities. When in 1964 the studio hosted Top of The Pops for its first 12-week run, producer Johnnie Stewart hired Goodwin to shoot the bands. He was paid ₤30 a week and given a credit at the end of the programme. His pictures were used as backdrops for non-appearing artists and the chart rundown. He continued until 1973, missing only six shows in that time, in the process photographing every single act that entered the Top 30 of the UK Singles Chart, except for Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. Often he would be dispatched to get a shot of an absent act, and was known for his tenacity in gaining photo opportunities against all odds.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{mention of}} the poems came from Dorothy, in a letter sent to Coleridge in December 1798. Of [...] "Strange fits", she wrote, [...] "this next poem is a {{favorite}} of mine—i.e. of me Dorothy—". The first recorded mention of any of the [...] "Lucy poems" [...] (outside of notes by either William or Dorothy) occurred after the April 1799 death of Coleridge's son Berkeley. Coleridge was then living in Germany, and received the news through a letter from his friend Thomas Poole, who in his condolences mentioned Wordsworth's [...] "A slumber": But I cannot truly say that I grieve—I am perplexed—I am sad—and a little thing, a very trifle would make me weep; but for the death of the Baby I have not wept!—Oh! this strange, strange, strange <b>Scene-shifter,</b> Death! that giddies one with insecurity, & so unsubstantiates the living Things that one has grasped and handled!—/ Some months ago Wordsworth transmitted to me a most sublime Epitaph / whether it had any reality, I cannot say.—Most probably, in some gloomier moment he had fancied the moment in which his sister might die. Later, the essayist Charles Lamb (1775-1834) wrote to Wordsworth in 1801 to say that [...] "She dwelt" [...] was one of his favourites from Lyrical Ballads. Likewise Romantic poet John Keats (1795-1821) praised the poem. To the diarist and writer Henry Crabb Robinson (1775-1867), [...] "She dwelt" [...] gave [...] "the powerful effect of the loss of a very obscure object upon one tenderly attached to it—the opposition between the apparent strength of the passion and the insignificance of the object is delightfully conceived." ...|$|E
5000|$|His father Gustav Saudek was a Jew, and {{the family}} was persecuted by Germans during World War II. Kája and his brother Jan were imprisoned in the Nazi {{concentration}} camp Luža in Poland. Many of his family members died in the Theresienstadt concentration camp, but both brothers and their father survived the imprisonment {{and came back to}} Prague. Saudek became familiar with the American comics in his early years. He was inspired mainly by the works of Walt Disney and later he was influenced also by Robert Crumb and Richard Corben. He became a technical writer and in 1950s worked as a <b>scene-shifter</b> at the Barrandov Film Studios. In 1966, the film director Miloš Macourek used some of his drawings in the film Kdo chce zabít Jessii? (Who Wants to Kill Jessie?) and Saudek's works gradually became more popular in the Czechoslovakia. In the 1960s he created comics drawings for the magazine Popmusic Express (Underground Com-comix), as well as illustrations to the scripts by Jaroslav Foglar, Ondřej Neff and others. In 1969 he published a part of the comic series Muriel a andělé (Muriel and Angels). The album depicts {{the story of a young}} physician Muriel, who meets an angel Ro, coming from a distant future. Ro attempts to introduce her to a world without hate, evil people and death. The communist censorship considered the story potentially dangerous and banned its publishing. Saudek's style was considered as too [...] "American", some of his critics labelled his work as an example of bourgeois kitsch. The complete cycle was published later, in 1991. The actress Olga Schoberová served as a model for Muriel and Saudek's brother Jan was depicted as the main negative character, general Xeron. In 1971 he contributed to the film Čtyři vraždy stačí, drahoušku (Four Murders is enough, Honey) with his drawings.|$|E
