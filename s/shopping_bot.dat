40|$|Shopping online {{is still}} a {{confusing}} activity due to many vendors, inconsistent information, and di#erent vendor site organization. Shopping agents based on user-centered business models have been unsuccessful in the past because shoppers have not perceived price comparison as a service worth paying for. As a result <b>shopping</b> <b>bots</b> today are biased in favor of vendors who pay fees to be listed. To make user-centered business models viable, shopping agents must become more useful. To this end we describe a shopping assistant capable of learning the heterogeneous and dynamic preferences of shoppers by observing their behavior unobtrusively, and of presenting shoppers with adaptively customized information about new items discovered by autonomously monitoring vendor sites...|$|R
40|$|Faster, frictionless, cheaper, better: {{these are}} said to be the {{hallmarks}} of economic activity on the Internet. Search theory suggests use of the Net could reduce the prices consumers pay, but product branding, price discrimination based on data mining, and auctions may raise prices. The Net has lowered most prices, but raised others, even when <b>shop</b> <b>bots</b> are used. Price dispersion is greater on the Net, and Net sellers change their prices more often. The role of intermediaries has not been reduced. The quality of service is idiosyncratic and highly variable. The Net is a new and distinctive avenue of commerce, but those who argue it has invalidated conventional economic principles are well off base.

40|$|The Random Darknet Shopper is an {{automated}} online <b>shopping</b> <b>bot</b> which we provide {{with a budget}} of $ 100 in Bitcoins per week. Once a week the bot goes shopping in the deep web where it randomly chooses and purchases one item and has it mailed directly to the exhibition space. Once the items arrive they are unpacked and displayed, each new object adding to a landscape of traded goods from the Darknet. The Random Darknet Shopper is a live Mail Art piece, {{an exploration of the}} deep web via the goods traded there. It directly connects the Darknet with the gallery. By randomizing its consumerism, the bot is guaranteed a wide selection of goods from the thousands listed on deepweb markets. In its first run from October 2014 - January 2015, Random Darknet Shopper bought 12 items from the deepweb market Agora, which were displayed at Kunst Halle St. Gallen in the exhibition «The Darknet - From Memes to Onionland. An Exploration». Since Agora discontinued its services in September, Random Darknet Shopper will now order items from Alpha Bay, currently the largest deepweb market place...|$|E
40|$|As {{electronic}} commerce environments {{become more and}} more interactive, privacy is a matter of increasing concern. Many surveys have investigated households' privacy attitudes and concerns, revealing a general desire among Internet users to protect their privacy. To complement these questionnaire-based studies, we conducted an experiment in which we compared selfreported privacy preferences of 171 participants with their actual disclosing behavior during an online shopping episode. Our results suggest that current approaches to protect online users' privacy, such as EU data protection regulation or P 3 P, may face difficulties to do so effectively. This is due to their underlying assumption that people are not only privacy conscious, but will also act accordingly. In our study, most individuals stated that privacy was important to them, with concern centering on the disclosure of different aspects of personal information. However, regardless of their specific privacy concerns, most participants did not live up to their self-reported privacy preferences. As participants were drawn into the sales dialogue with an anthropomorphic 3 -D <b>shopping</b> <b>bot,</b> they answered a majority of questions, even if these were highly personal. Moreover, different privacy statements had no effect on the amount of information disclosed; in fact, the mentioning of EU regulation seemed to cause a feeling of 'false security'. The results suggest that people appreciate highly communicative EC environments and forget privacy concerns once they are `inside the Web'...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDiscounts {{based on}} {{the total value of}} {{purchase}} is a common business practice among the online retailers. The discounts offered could be in the form of rebates, cash backs, gift vouchers, or reward points. The comparison <b>shopping</b> <b>bots</b> provide only price information for individual products but do not consider the total value discounts that could be accrued by buying more products from the same retailer. In this paper, we consider a buyer interested in buying M different items from N retailers who offer total value discounts. The buyer is faced with an optimization problem of choosing the retailers and the items to buy from them to minimize the total buying cost taking into account the total value discounts offered by the retailers. We propose an integer programming formulation for the problem, which can be integrated with the current comparison shopping search engines. As this problem needs to be solved online, we propose a linear programming based heuristic to obtain a nearoptimal solution that could be used with the commercial solvers to accelerate the solution time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Web pages {{representing}} {{offerings of}} products and services are {{a major source of}} data for Semantic Web-based e-commerce. This data could be useful for numerous applications, e. g. (1) more precise product search engines and <b>shopping</b> <b>bots,</b> (2) aggregation or enrichment of multi-vendor catalogs using public product descriptions, or (3) the automated discovery of additional alternatives based on the combination of multiple items. While there are already some ontologies for products and services available, they are very large in size (20 – 70, 000 classes), and thus not always suitable as ontology imports. In this paper, we take a different approach: We represent the semantics of offerings on the Web using a very lightweight ontology of datatype properties in combination with popular classifications like UNSPSC and eCl@ss. We then demonstrate how this representation can be mapped easily to comprehensive ontologies for products and services like eClassOWL 1. Our approach provides a straightforward solution for annotating offerings on the Web while avoiding the overhead of importing fully-fledged products and services ontologies in any single annotation. We can show that our proposal has technical advantages and eliminates legal problems when reusing existing standards. 1...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{contexts}} in which people make judgments about prior judgments. For example, Internet <b>shopping</b> <b>bots</b> (e. g., NexTag. com) allow consumers to search for products and, if the price is too high, list a price at which they would consider making the purchase (i. e., base judgment). If the price drops to this level, the vendor generates an e-mail inviting the consumer to execute the transaction at the reduced price (i. e., contingent judgment). The authors show that the consideration price depends {{on the content of}} retrieved information, whereas the willingness to execute the transaction at the consideration price depends on the ease-of-retrieving the information. The authors use different offer prices to encourage the consumer to retrieve information consistent with different product quality levels. The authors also select offer prices so that information retrieval is more difficult at moderate offer prices than at high or low offer prices. Accordingly, the authors show that the consideration price increases as the offer price increases, but the willingness to execute the transaction at the consideration price is greater when there are high and low, as opposed to moderate, offer prices...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{distributed}} data mining {{is very important}} in network problems. Ina distributed environment (such as a sensor or IP network), one has distributed probes placed at strategic locations within the network. The problem here {{is to be able to}} correlatethe data seen at the various probes, and discover patterns in the global data seen at all the different probes. There could be different models of distributed data mining here, but one could involve a NOC that collects data from the distributed sites, and another in which all sites are treated equally. The goal here obviously would be to minimize the amount of data shipped between the various sites — essentially, to reduce the communication overhead. In distributed mining, one problem is how to mine across multipleheterogeneous data sources: multi-database and multirelational mining. Another important new area is adversary data mining. In a growing number of domains — email spam, counter-terrorism, intrusiondetection/computer security, click spam, search engine spam, surveillance, fraud detection, <b>shop</b> <b>bots,</b> file sharing, etc. — data mining systems face adversaries that deliberately manipulate the data to sabotage them (e. g. make them produce false negatives). In this paper need to develop systems that explicitly take this into account, by combining data mining with game theory...|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{attention}} in artificial intelligence (AI) for Business has focused on business to consumer transactions. <b>Shopping</b> <b>bots,</b> systems to recommend movies and books based on similar opinions by other users and news filtering agents, are just some examples. However, we feel that AI can have a larger impact on the supply chain that delivers goods and services to the end consumer. Reductions in costs and the pervasiveness of the Interact have encouraged companies to move towards using e-commerce for transactions with their business partners. Companies are willing to invest resource because of the reduced product cycle times and the lower transaction costs that they expect. A result of this movement is that companies can afford to interact with {{a larger number of}} trading partners and form project and customer specific partnerships that would have been too costly in the past. To manage a larger and more dynamic set of partnerships {{and to be able to}} take advantage of transient opportunities, business users will need decision-support systems to identify and analyze the opportunities in terms of their business objectives. In this paper, we describe our agent-based decision-support framework for creating systems to support trading partners in the e-supply chain. In particular, we will focus on the issues that need to be addressed in order to create a viable and useful decision-support system...|$|R
50|$|Gameplay {{remains largely}} {{similar to that}} of its predecessor. The game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up where the player must violently {{dispense}} of enemies with the help of numerous weapons. Recurring elements from the original include Dish Magic and <b>Shop</b> <b>Bots</b> where one can buy upgrades and items with money received through defeating enemies. The biggest addition is a new playable character, Yuki, who controls differently from The Dishwasher in combat. Co-op has also been fully integrated into the story-mode allowing for an exclusive campaign. There are five new weapons in the game, including a large syringe dubbed The Painkiller and an oversized pair of scissors titled The Guillotine. Combat revisions have been made: now the player can stock up to four weapons at once with the help of two sets of load outs that can be interchanged at all times. Guns are now automatically mapped to function on the right trigger, and normal enemies no longer have exclusive executions as they are all down to weaponry. A new gameplay feature is the addition of collectible Beads that can be equipped to give various status effects such as improved strength against specific enemies or attacks draining health. The guitar minigame also makes a return; however, the Psycho Picks that were granted in the original game for finishing them do not.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the recent}} misfortunes of many dotcoms, {{e-commerce}} will have major and lasting effects on economic activity. But {{the rise and}} fall in the valuations of the first wave of e-commerce companies show that vague promises of distant profits are insufficient. Only business models based on sound economic propositions will survive. This book provides professionals, investors, and MBA students the tools they need to evaluate the wide range of actual and potential e-commerce businesses at the microeconomic level. It demonstrates how these tools can be used to assess a variety of existing applications. Advances in web-based technology [...] particularly automation and delegation technologies such as smart agents, <b>shopping</b> <b>bots,</b> and bidding elves [...] support the further growth of e-commerce. In addition to enabling consumers to conduct automated comparisons and sellers to access visitors' background information in real time, such software programs can make decisions for individuals, negotiate with other programs, and participate in online markets. Much of e-commerce's economic value arises from this kind of automation, which not only reduces operating costs but adds value by generating new market interactions. This text teaches how to analyze the added value of such applications, considering consumer behavior, pricing strategies, incentives, and other critical factors. It discusses added value in several e-commerce arenas: online shopping, business-to-business e-commerce, application design, online negotiation (one-to-one trading), online auctions (one-to-many trading), and many-to-many electronic exchanges. Combining insights from several years of microeconomic research as well as from game theory and computer science, it stresses the importance of economic engineering in application design as well as the need for business models {{to take into account the}} "total game. " As the only serious treatment of the microeconomics of e-commerce, this book should be read by anyone seeking e-commerce solutions or planning to work in the field. business models, profits, investment, technology, online markets, automation, application design, negotiation, engineering, exchange...|$|R
