5|$|Paul Oppenheimer and Edward Zalta used an {{automated}} theorem prover—Prover9—to validate Anselm's ontological thesis. Prover9 subsequently discovered a <b>simpler,</b> formally valid (if not necessarily sound) ontological argument {{from a single}} non-logical premise.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of standard, genetically uniform organisms that could produce repeatable experimental results was {{essential for the}} {{development of}} molecular genetics. After early work with Drosophila and maize, the adoption of <b>simpler</b> model systems like the bread mold Neurospora crassa made it possible to connect genetics to biochemistry, most importantly with Beadle and Tatum's one gene-one enzyme hypothesis in 1941. Genetics experiments on even <b>simpler</b> systems like tobacco mosaic virus and bacteriophage, aided by the new technologies of electron microscopy and ultracentrifugation, forced scientists to re-evaluate the literal meaning of life; virus heredity and reproducing nucleoprotein cell structures outside the nucleus ("plasmagenes") complicated the accepted Mendelian-chromosome theory.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{present and}} past tenses of the verb are called <b>simple</b> present (present <b>simple)</b> and <b>simple</b> past (past <b>simple),</b> to {{distinguish}} them from progressive or other compound forms.

50|$|In {{the finite}} case, a group is {{absolutely}} <b>simple</b> if {{and only if}} it is <b>simple.</b> However, in the infinite case, absolutely <b>simple</b> is a stronger property than <b>simple.</b> The property of being strictly <b>simple</b> is somewhere in between.|$|R
5|$|The <b>simpler</b> {{roots of}} designs in Generation I {{prompted}} greater complexity in later games. Designs, in general, {{have become increasingly}} complex and thematic in newer games. Sneasel, for example, draws inspiration from the Japanese yōkai kamaitachi, mythical creatures with fast, razor-sharp claws that hunt in packs. These elements are all found in Sneasel's design and characteristics. New Pokémon introduced in Generation VI, for example, are heavily influenced by the culture and fauna of Europe (namely France). However, by the release of X and Y in 2013, Sugimori stated he wishes for Pokémon design {{to return to the}} <b>simpler</b> roots of the franchise.|$|E

50|$|An {{equivalent}} {{definition of}} a <b>simple</b> Lie group follows from the Lie correspondence: a connected Lie group is <b>simple</b> if its Lie algebra is <b>simple.</b> An important technical point is thata <b>simple</b> Lie group may contain discrete normal subgroups, hence being a <b>simple</b> Lie group is different from being <b>simple</b> as an abstract group.|$|R

50|$|Any {{quotient}} of a ring by a maximal {{ideal is}} a <b>simple</b> ring. In particular, a field is a <b>simple</b> ring. In fact a division ring {{is also a}} <b>simple</b> ring. A ring is <b>simple</b> if and only its opposite ring Ro is <b>simple.</b>|$|R
5|$|Another {{approach}} to understanding mirror symmetry was suggested by Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and Eric Zaslow in 1996. According to their conjecture, {{now known as}} the SYZ conjecture, mirror symmetry can be understood by dividing a Calabi–Yau manifold into <b>simpler</b> pieces and then transforming them to get the mirror Calabi–Yau.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{research}} on live coral species {{is limited to}} a few studied species. Studying Porites coral provides a stable foundation for geochemical interpretations that is much <b>simpler</b> to physically extract data in comparison to Platygyra species where the complexity of Platygyra species skeletal structure creates difficulty when physically sampled, which happens {{to be one of the}} only multidecadal living coral records used for coral paleoclimate modeling.|$|E
5|$|DAN later {{proposed}} a <b>simpler</b> 24-hour wait after {{any and all}} recreational diving, but there were objections {{on the grounds that}} such a long delay would result in lost business for island diving resorts and the risks of DCS when flying after diving were too low to warrant this blanket restraint.|$|E
50|$|In {{the finite}} case, a group is {{strictly}} <b>simple</b> if {{and only if}} it is <b>simple.</b> However, in the infinite case, strictly <b>simple</b> is a stronger property than <b>simple.</b>|$|R

Smaller, poorer farms might combine barns and dwelling houses, have <b>simpler</b> storage areas, and use the facilities of other farms for activities {{they could not afford}} to build houses for.|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored welding {{machines}} are most popular at the hobbyist level, as the machines are slightly <b>simpler</b> but mainly because they avoid {{the cost of}} providing shield gas, either through a rented cylinder or with {{the high cost of}} disposable cylinders.|$|E
5|$|Following {{issues with}} his make-up {{throughout}} the first season, Michael Dorn's Klingon prosthetics were modified.
