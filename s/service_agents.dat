5|$|On the Matoikas {{third and}} final return voyage from Italy, begun on 17May, U.S. Customs <b>Service</b> <b>agents</b> at New York seized $150,000 worth of cocaine—along with {{valuable}} silks and jewels—being smuggled into the United States.

40|$|When a {{warranty}} provider outsources warranty servicing to {{an external}} <b>service</b> <b>agent</b> this agent may {{act in a}} fraudulent manner. In this paper we consider a special case of <b>service</b> <b>agent</b> fraud-with the <b>service</b> <b>agent</b> overbilling the warranty provider {{for some of the}} warranty claims. A detailed inspection of a claim may be made to identify whether or not the <b>service</b> <b>agent</b> has committed fraud, but this inspection involves an additional cost to the warranty provider. This cost may be recovered by imposing a penalty on the <b>service</b> <b>agent</b> whenever a fraud is committed and it is detected. This penalty is specified in the maintenance service contract. A game theoretic approach is used to find the optimal overbilling strategy for the <b>service</b> <b>agent</b> and the optimal inspection strategy for the warranty provider. The optimal solution is the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of a static game between the two parties...|$|R

In May 2010, Boeing announced plans to submit the V-22 for the VXX presidential transport replacement.|$|E
5|$|In November 1922, U.S. Customs <b>Service</b> <b>agents,</b> {{seized a}} cache of Colt {{magazine}} guns aboard President Arthur. The entire crew was questioned but all denied any knowledge of the eight weapons found stowed behind a bulkhead. In August the following year, President Arthur took on board a seaman suffering from pneumonia from the Norwegian freighter Eastern Star in a mid-ocean transfer. The ship's doctor and nurse attended to the sailor but were unable to save him.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 2006, Dick Cheney shot Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old Texas attorney, while {{participating}} in a quail hunt at Armstrong ranch in Kenedy County, Texas. Secret <b>Service</b> <b>agents</b> and medical aides, who were traveling with Cheney, came to Whittington's assistance and treated his birdshot wounds to his right cheek, neck, and chest. An ambulance standing by for the Vice President took Whittington to nearby Kingsville before he was flown by helicopter to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital. On February 14, 2006, Whittington had a non-fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due {{to at least one}} lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart. Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets, doctors decided to leave up to 30 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body rather than try to remove them.|$|E

5|$|The attack {{followed}} a two-year lull in Allied aircraft carrier operations against Norway, {{and took the}} German forces by surprise. The choice of the target area was guided by intelligence gained from decoding German radio signals and reports from Norwegian Secret Intelligence <b>Service</b> <b>agents,</b> and two Norwegian airmen flew with the attack force to provide advice on the local geography. While historians have {{found it difficult to}} determine the exact number of ships sunk, Operation Leader damaged the German war effort by considerably disrupting the convoy system in the region and reducing shipments of iron ore.|$|E
5|$|The final {{decision}} to undertake Operation Tungsten {{was made in}} mid-March {{on the basis of}} a decrypted radio message that indicated that Tirpitz was almost ready for combat and would conduct high-speed trials on 1 April. As a result of the delays to the operation, the sailing of the attack force coincided with the departure of Convoy JW 58 for the Soviet Union. It was hoped that if German forces spotted the British fleet it would be assumed that the warships were supporting the convoy. As part of the final preparations for the attack a full-scale rehearsal was conducted using the training range at Loch Eriboll on 28 March. From 1 April onwards, the Admiralty received hourly weather reports from a group of Norwegian Secret Intelligence <b>Service</b> <b>agents</b> in Alta, near Kaafjord.|$|E

Thomas sees visions of the aliens' plans: their entire civilization travels from planet to planet, exterminating all indigenous life and harvesting the planet of all natural resources. After Secret <b>Service</b> <b>agents</b> and military personnel kill the alien, Thomas reluctantly authorizes a nuclear attack; a B-2 Spirit fires a nuclear warhead tipped cruise missile at a saucer positioned above Houston, but the saucer remains intact.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{adaptive}} efficient job scheduling service model on Grids using multi agent systems and a market like Service level Agreement (SLA) negotiation protocol based on the Contract Net model. This job scheduling service model involves four types of agents: <b>service</b> user <b>agents,</b> <b>service</b> provider <b>agents,</b> local scheduler agents and inter-grid <b>agents.</b> <b>Service</b> provider <b>agents</b> provide <b>services</b> to <b>service</b> user <b>agents</b> by allocating resources using local scheduler <b>agents.</b> <b>Service</b> provider <b>agents</b> provide <b>services</b> to <b>service</b> user <b>agents</b> by allocating resources using local scheduler <b>agents.</b> The <b>service</b> provider <b>agents</b> may contact the inter-grid agents if enough resources are not available in their own grid. Inter-grid agents provide resources from the neighboring grid. The <b>service</b> provider <b>agent</b> may adapt the dedicated service according to its interactions with <b>service</b> user <b>agent.</b> The SLA negotiation protocol is a hierarchical bidding mechanism involving negotiations between the four agents. In this protocol, the agents exchange SLA announcements, SLA-bid, and SLA-awards to negotiate the schedule of jobs on Grid Compute resources. To deal {{with the presence of}} uncertainties, renegotiation is used to allow the agents to re-negotiate the SLA in failur...|$|R

5|$|Following {{the attack}} on 17 July, the British learned from intercepted German radio {{transmissions}} and reports provided by Secret Intelligence <b>Service</b> <b>agents</b> that Tirpitz had not suffered any significant damage. Admiral Moore blamed the failure of Operation Mascot on the inexperience of the aircrew involved in the attack, and criticised the strike leader for not selecting alternative targets after {{it became clear that}} Tirpitz could not be accurately bombed. Moore also judged that further attacks on Kaafjord using Barracudas would be futile, as the dive bombers' slow speed gave the Germans enough time to cover Tirpitz with smoke between the time raids were detected and their arrival over the target area. The Admiralty was hopeful that a strategy of repeatedly striking Kaafjord over a 48-hour period would wear down the defences, and Moore agreed to attempt another attack. Consideration was also given to flying fast and long-ranged de Havilland Mosquito bombers off the carriers in an attempt to achieve surprise, but none of these land-based aircraft could be spared from supporting the Allied bombing of Germany.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, William Howard Taft and Porfirio Díaz {{planned a}} summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, an {{historic}} first meeting between a U.S. {{president and a}} Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico. But tensions rose {{on both sides of}} the border, including threats of assassination, so the Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret <b>Service</b> <b>agents,</b> FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Burnham was put in charge of a 250 private security detail hired by Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured and disarmed the assassin within only a few feet of Taft and Díaz.|$|E
5|$|Spirit Splash occurs the Friday {{before the}} Homecoming game, {{and serves as}} a pep rally where {{students}} descend into the pond to demonstrate school spirit. Spirit Splash began in 1995 when then-Student Body President Miguel Torregrossa was pushed into the Reflecting Pond by one of his cabinet members and fellow students followed suit. Along with the thousands of students who attend, there are members of the community, local dignitaries, alumni, children and even dogs who come to join in on the festivities. Knightro, the Marching Knights, cheerleaders, student athletes, and dancers all participate in the pep rally, usually followed by a concert. Spirit Splash was made possible in part by weight testing performed on the Reflecting Pond in preparation for President Richard Nixon's visit to the university to speak at its 1973 commencement. It was determined {{that the best way to}} protect the president would be to hold commencement in the pond itself, after being drained, so that Secret <b>Service</b> <b>agents</b> could be stationed on the roofs of the adjacent buildings.|$|E
