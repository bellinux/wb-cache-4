40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} secondary flow control by boundary layer suction at discrete locations {{has been carried}} out throughout the last years. The focus in the investigations has been set to understanding the henomena present at aspirated compressors and giving guidelines for practical implementation of suction into compressors. All experiments have been performed at the High Speed Cascade Wind Tunnel HGW of the German Aerospace Center DLR in Berlin. The chosen airfoil is a NACA 65 type due to its widely known characteristics and the good performance at the aerodynamic design point. Design conditions include a Mach number of 0. 67 and a Reynolds number of 560. 000 based on 40 mm chord length. Former investigations have proven the working principles at design conditions, this work aims at presenting off design data which is of importance for the system integration. The results show that there is a wide range of incidence angles at which the boundary layer suction is effective. The total pressure loss can be decreased by substantial amounts. In the surge and <b>stall</b> <b>area</b> at low and high incidence angles, the efficiency of the suction depends strongly on the shape of the suction slots. Anyhow the flow control is not capable of affecting the flow if complete separation of the boundary layer has already occurred. The effectiveness of the suction is best near aerodynamic design conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{tail rotor}} of {{conventional}} helicopters {{has always been}} considered a necessary 'evil'. It is necessary to counteract the reaction torque of the engine and to control the helicopter in yaw but it consumes substantial power, has only marginal control authority under unfavourable wind conditions, and it is noisy, vulnerable and dangerous. A solution to all these problems would be a helicopter concept that {{eliminates the need for}} a tail rotor. The so-called 'Ornicopter', a helicopter with flapping blades, is such a concept. The mechanism of the Ornicopter is inspired by bird flight. When birds flap their wings they are able to generate both a lifting force and a propelling force from this single movement. Instead of propelling a helicopter blade by spinning it around and deriving lift from this rotating movement, as is done in conventional helicopter configurations, the Ornicopter flaps its blades like a bird and derives both lift and a propulsive force from this movement. In this case the blades propel themselves and {{there is no longer a}} need for a direct torque supplied by the engine to rotate the blades. The Ornicopter's rotor, therefore, will not cause a reaction torque on the fuselage, which makes the tail rotor's anti-torque function redundant. The goal of the present thesis is to develop a thorough understanding of the Ornicopter concept and its feasibility throughout a realistic flight envelope. The first part presents the analysis of the Ornicopter's main characteristics regarding performance, stability, controllability, handling qualities, as well as an exploratory vibratory analysis. In the second part a preliminary design and sizing thereof are presented based on the conclusions obtained in the first part. The basis for the Ornicopter's study is an analytically-derived flight mechanics model. The model is based on the blade element theory (BET) and considers 6 rigid body degrees of freedom (DoF), 3 DoF blade flapping dynamics and 3 DoF Pitt-Peters inflow dynamics. Previous mathematical models developed as a proof of the Ornicopter concept have concentrated mainly on hovering flight. The model developed in this thesis is capable of representing the Ornicopter's dynamics well within its entire operational flight envelope. As a benchmark for the Ornicopter's specifications, the Bolkow Bo- 105 helicopter is used. The Bo- 105 helicopter is a light twin-engine, multi-purpose helicopter developed in Germany in the 1970 s. For the initial values of the design parameters of the Ornicopter (such as rotor radius, blade loading, rotor tip velocity, vertical fin size) the Bo- 105 helicopter design is used. A 2 X 2 anti-symmetric rotor flapping configuration (with two opposite blades flapping in the same direction) is used for the Ornicopter in order to eliminate the necessity for a tail rotor. Using these design parameters it is demonstrated that the Ornicopter rotor can generate enough propulsive torque to rotate the blades with modest flapping amplitudes (maximum less than 9 deg). The present thesis demonstrates that, compared to the Bo- 105 helicopter, the Ornicopter concept suffers from higher required power, a smaller flight envelope (mainly due to the larger rotor <b>stall</b> <b>area)</b> and lower yaw stability. All these drawbacks are attributed to the large rotor blade angle of attack variation introduced by the forced flapping mechanism and the absence of a tail rotor. In the second part of this thesis, the Ornicopter concept is optimized for performance. Keeping the performance specifications of the Bo- 105 as the objectives, the design values (blade radius, blade loading etc) are turned to fit the Ornicopter concept and no longer use the Bo- 105 design values. The design optimization is formulated through minimization of the required power, while satisfying the <b>stall</b> <b>area</b> requirement. The thesis proves that the optimal design for the Ornicopter as compared to the Bo- 105 benchmark is characterized by a lower blade loading, increased rotor tip velocity and larger vertical fin size. This optimal design results in an enlarged flight envelope due to the reduced rotor <b>stall</b> <b>area</b> and improved yaw stability in forward flight. Nevertheless, despite these improvements in the Ornicopter's flight envelope, there is a slight increase in required power when compared with the Bo- 105 specification (approximately 5 % at 150 knots). To compensate for the higher profile power needed for the Ornicopter's optimal design, a larger rotor radius is required in order to reduce the induced power and keep the increase in the total required power to a minimum. This thesis may be considered as a first step in rationalizing the expectations regarding the Ornicopter's tailless helicopter design. The thesis proved that this new concept shows a slightly poorer performance than that of conventional helicopters regarding power consumption in forward flight and service ceiling. This is disappointing since one of the assumptions was that the elimination of the tail rotor would also eliminate the power consumption associated with a tail rotor. Further analyses of the Ornicopter's performance (such as endurance, payloads, climbing performance, and environmental performance related to safety and noise), costs or maintenance should be performed for a comprehensive understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of this helicopter concept.

40|$|The flow {{over the}} inner {{halves of the}} rotor blades on a Kellet YG- 1 B {{autogiro}} was investigated in flight by making camera records of the motion of silk streamers attached to the upper surfaces of the blades.

For the sake of comparison, corresponding theoretical boundaries were obtained. Both the size of the <b>stalled</b> <b>area</b> and its rate of growth with increasing tip-speed ratio were found to be larger than the theory predicted, although experiment agreed with theory with regard to shape and general location of the <b>stalled</b> <b>area.</b> The <b>stalled</b> region may be an important factor in both the rotor lift-drag ratio and the blade flapping motion at the higher tip-speed ratios.
