40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{series of}} hydrogels were {{prepared}} from acrylamide and 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methylpropanesulfonic acid (AMPS) monomers with 0 – 80 mol % AMPS and using N,N 9 -methylenebis(acrylamide) as the crosslinker. The <b>swelling</b> <b>capacities</b> of hydrogels were measured {{in water and}} in aqueous NaCl solutions. The volume swelling ratio qv of hydrogels in water increases sharply when the mole fraction fc of AMPS increases from 0 to 0. 06. At higher values of fc from 0. 06 up to 0. 18, {{no change in the}} <b>swelling</b> <b>capacities</b> of hydrogels was observed; in this range of fc, qv becomes nearly constant at 750. However, as fc further increases, qv starts to increase again monotonically over the entire range of fc. At a fixed value of fc, the swelling ratio of hydrogels decreases with increasing salt concentration in the external solution. The results of the swelling measurements in aqueous salt solutions were compared with the predictions of the Flory–Rehner theory of swelling equilibrium. It was shown that the theory correctly predicts the swelling behavior of hydrogels up to 80 mol % charge densities.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to improve the {{mechanical}} properties of superporous hydrogels. The main approach used in this study was forming interpenetrating polymer networks by incorporating a second polymer network inside the superporous hydrogel structures. Synthetic polyacrylonitrile polymer and polysaccharides were used to penetrate inside the superporous hydrogels. Mechanical properties, including compression strength and elasticity, were significantly improved. The <b>swelling</b> <b>capacities</b> of the resultant IPN hydrogels were decreased, whereas the swelling speed was still very fast, ranging from 2 – 4 minutes. The macroscopic properties including swelling behavior and mechanical improvements were all well explained by the microscopic structures. Various scaffold-like fiber network structures were observed along or connecting the cell walls of superporous hydrogel pores. Restrictions on volume swelling ratio were observed universally for various types of superporous IPN hydrogels. The existence of the scaffold-like polymer networks enforced a restraint on the volume change upon hydrogel swelling, which is essentially the extension limit of the incorporated polymer networks in water. The elasticity of superporous hydrogels is improved tremendously by the polysaccharide hybrids approach. Depending on the type of polysaccharide strengtheners used, the superporous hydrogel hybrids can be stretched to about 200 % to 300 % elongation of their original length. Such elasticity has never been reported on any hydrogels. The applications of superporous hydrogels could be greatly broadened by such improvement in mechanical properties. ...|$|R

Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) and 4, 4 '-azo-bis(4 -cyanopentanoic acid) were used as the crosslinker and UV-photoinitiator, respectively. The effects of varying the Na-AMPS monomer concentration {{within the range of}} 30 - 50 % w/v and the crosslinker concentration within the range of 0. 1 - 1. 0 % mol (relative to monomer) were studied in terms of their influence on water absorption properties. The hydrogel sheets exhibited extremely high <b>swelling</b> <b>capacities</b> in aqueous media which were dependent on monomer concentration, crosslink density, and the ionic strength and composition of the immersion medium. The effects of varying the number-average molecular weight of the PEGDA crosslinker from = 250 to 700 were also investigated. Interestingly, it was found that increasing the molecular weight and therefore the crosslink length at constant crosslink density decreased both the rate of water absorption and the equilibrium water content. Cytotoxicity testing by the direct contact method with mouse fibroblast L 929 cells indicated that the synthesized hydrogels were nontoxic. On the basis of these results, it is considered that photopolymerized Na-AMPS hydrogels crosslinked with PEGDA show considerable potential for biomedical use as dressings for partial thickness burns.

40|$|Objective. This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} evaluating the kinetics and thermodynamics of water absorption of high swelling polymers when used in tablet formulations containing an abusable medication. Background. Superabsorbent polymers have large <b>swelling</b> <b>capacities</b> and rapidly swell in aqueous media. This property {{can be used to}} help deter different forms of prescription abuse, particularly injection of drug extracts from crushed products. SAPs can accomplish this by rapidly absorbing and limiting recoverable volume of extraction media and preventing aspiration into a syringe. Methods. Superabsorbent polymers based on acrylamide, sodium acrylate, and potassium acrylate were fashioned into one side of a bilayer tablet with the other side being an inactive drug-carrier layer; 175 mg each layer. Post-compaction swelling and deterrence properties were determined after the tablets were crushed and 10 mL of water added with no stirring or mixing. The time to complete gelation and final flow properties were then monitored for each sample. After complete gelation, the ability to draw any non-absorbed water or swollen superabsorbent particles through a 26 -gauge needle was assessed. Results. Each crushed tablet completely turned into a gel mass in 60 seconds or less. The larger the swollen particles the more capable they were in clogging the needle and making it more difficult to draw up a noticeable amount of liquid compared to control tablets. Conclusion. Overall, the acrylic-based superabsorbents performed best with complete gelling in less than 30 seconds, which immediately made the extracting solution non-syringeable. Grants.

40|$|In this study, two {{series of}} {{chitosan}} 3, 6 -bis(arylcarbamate) - 2 -(isobutylurea) s and corresponding coated-type chiral stationary phases (CSPs) were prepared from {{two kinds of}} chitosans with different molecular weights. Most of the prepared CSPs demonstrated better enantioseparation performance than the homemade CSP of cellulose tris(3, 5 -dimethylphenylcarbamate). The CSPs of chitosan 3, 6 -bis(4 -methylphenylcarbamate) - 2 -(isobutylurea) with higher molecular weight and chitosan 3, 6 -bis(3 -chloro- 4 -methylphenylcarbamate) - 2 -(isobutylurea) with lower molecular weight possessed outstanding chiral recognition abilities which were at least as good {{as that of the}} commercialized CSP of Chiralcel OD-H towards the tested chiral analytes. Except for the two CSPs derived from chitosan 3, 6 -bis(4 -methylphenylcarbamate) - 2 -(isobutylurea) s, the CSPs (the first class) with the chiral selectors of lower molecular weight provided better enantioseparations than the ones (the second class) with the chiral selectors of higher molecular weight. On the other hand, the chiral selectors of the first class CSPs showed higher <b>swelling</b> <b>capacities</b> in organic solvents than the ones of the second class. All prepared CSPs could be analyzed with a wider range of mobile phases, in which some "unusual organic solvents" such as ethyl acetate, chloroform and THF etc. could be used as additives. According to separation performance and tolerance against organic solvents, we concluded that the chitosan derivatives with branched-chain alkyl urea at 2 -C of glucosamine residue were preferable to be used as chiral selectors for enantiomeric separation.
