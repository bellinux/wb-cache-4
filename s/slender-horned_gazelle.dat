50|$|The rhim gazelle (Gazella leptoceros), {{also known}} as the <b>slender-horned</b> <b>gazelle</b> or sand gazelle, is a <b>slender-horned</b> <b>gazelle,</b> mostly adapted to desert life. It is listed as Endangered because fewer than 2500 are left in the wild. These gazelles are found in Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya and Sudan.|$|E
50|$|As of 2001, 11 of Libya's mammal {{species and}} 2 of its bird species were endangered. About 41 of its plant species were also endangered. Endangered species in Libya include the Mediterranean monk seal, the leopard, and the <b>slender-horned</b> <b>gazelle.</b> The Bubal {{hartebeest}} and Sahara oryx are extinct.|$|E
50|$|The nation's {{wildlife}} {{is threatened}} by hunting. As of 2001, twenty-one mammal species and nine bird species are endangered, {{as well as two}} species of plants. Endangered species include: the waldrapp, northern white rhinoceros, tora hartebeest, <b>slender-horned</b> <b>gazelle,</b> and hawksbill turtle. The Sahara oryx has become extinct in the wild.|$|E
40|$|Faecal {{egg count}} {{patterns}} and clinical signs associated with gastro-intestinal (GI) nematodes of 107 zoo ruminants were monitored at fortnightly intervals for 1 year. The ruminants {{in this study}} were kept under different husbandry conditions at two sites of the Royal Zoological Society of Antwerp, the Antwerp Zoo and the Animal Park Planckendael. Artiodactylids involved were Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx), scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), bongos (Tragelaphus euryceros isaaci), sitatungas (Tragelaphus spekii gratus), common eland (Taurotragus oryx), impala (Aepyceros melampus), <b>slender-horned</b> <b>gazelles,</b> (Gazella leptoceros), blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus taurinus), Kordofan giraffes (Giraffe camelopardalis antiquorum) and okapi (Okapia johnstoni). Nematode eggs were recovered from 586 of 1606 (36. 5 %) individual faecal samples, using flotation techniques. Infection levels were distinctly low at Antwerp Zoo, probably due to zero grazing and daily dung removal. At Planckendael, the herds of Arabian oryx, scimitar-horned oryx and <b>slender-horned</b> <b>gazelles</b> showed markedly higher egg counts than the other herds, with more than 10 % of the faecal egg counts having more than 100 eggs per gram (epg) and maximum faecal egg counts of 600, 750 and 1350 epg, respectively. Faecal egg counts increased during the mid-grazing season (July) and peaked {{at the end of the}} grazing season (October). No clinical signs, such as loss of faecal consistency, could be correlated with faecal egg counts (P > 0. 05). With the exception of significantly more Nematodirus spp. eggs that were present in juvenile eland, no differences in faecal egg counts could be found between the sexes and different age groups. Abomasa and intestines of 17 animals that died during the survey were available for total worm counts. In one Arabian oryx, four <b>slender-horned</b> <b>gazelles</b> and one sitatunga low burdens ranging from 200 to 14, 300 were found. Nematode species recovered were Camelostrongylus mentulatus from the abomasa and Trichostrongylus retortaeformis, Nematodirus fillicollis, Capillaria spp. and Trichuris spp. from the intestines. Our findings suggest different nematode infection levels between herds, which are mainly due to husbandry conditions but to a lesser extent to species- or individual susceptibility. Identification of ungulates that are highly infected and knowledge of the seasonal variation of their helminths can contribute greatly to a well-adjusted species-specific management and helminth control program...|$|R
2500|$|African Plains allows {{visitors}} to walk past Transvaal lions, South African wild dogs, and Grévy's zebras, and see herds of Thomson's gazelles, lowland nyalas, and <b>slender-horned</b> <b>gazelles</b> sharing their home with lesser kudus, marabou storks, grey crowned cranes, blue cranes, and red-flanked duikers. Hybrid giraffes (Baringo × reticulated giraffe) roam nearby. The exhibit originally opened in 1941 {{and was the}} first in the country to allow {{visitors to}} view predators and their prey in a naturalistic setting as well as allowing large predators such as lions to be exhibited cage-free. This success was achieved through the creation of a series of deep moats, a set-up which can still be found at the zoo today. The wild dogs, however, can be viewed close-up from a glass-fronted viewing pavilion. The zoo has bred their lions on multiple occasions, including one male and two females born in January 2010 and three males and one female born in August 2013. The zoo, in partnership with the NY Daily News, held a contest to name the 2010 cubs, which made their public debut in April 2010. The winning names were [...] "Shani", [...] "Nala", and [...] "Adamma". The 2013 cubs were named [...] "Thulani", [...] "Ime", [...] "Bahata", and [...] "Amara" [...] and the three males can still be found on-exhibit at the zoo. The Carter Giraffe Building, a section of African Plains, features indoor/outdoor viewing of the zoo's giraffes and southern ostriches (Struthio camelus australis), and is also home to spotted hyenas, common dwarf mongoose, and southern white-faced owls. In June 2009, two aardvarks imported from Tanzania joined the exhibit. In September 2010, the pair gave birth to a male named [...] "Hoover", the first to ever be born at the zoo. In 1924, the zoo became the first in North America to exhibit the species.|$|R

50|$|Compared to the {{neighboring}} Erg Chech to the south, this erg is relatively humid. Groundwater is especially abundant towards the north-eastern {{edge of the}} Erg Iguidi. There are patches of seasonal vegetation with grasses and shrubs and in the summer the desert {{is used as a}} pasturage area. The Erg Iguidi supports a population of <b>slender-horned</b> <b>gazelle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Wadi El Rayan {{accommodates}} {{one of the}} world's {{few remaining}} populations of the endangered <b>slender-horned</b> <b>gazelle.</b> The dorcas gazelle is still found {{in the area in}} small numbers, while both the fennec fox and Rüppell's fox are scarce. There are 11 species of reptiles, 9 species of mammals, 13 species of resident birds, and 26 species of migrant and vagrant birds.|$|E
50|$|Desertification is {{a serious}} problem in the Sudans. There is also concern over soil erosion. Agricultural expansion, both public and private, has {{proceeded}} without conservation measures. The consequences have manifested themselves in the form of deforestation, soil desiccation, and the lowering of soil fertility and the water table.The nation's wildlife is threatened by hunting. As of 2001, twenty-one mammal species and nine bird species are endangered, as well as two species of plants. endangered species include: the waldrapp, northern white rhinoceros, tora hartebeest, <b>slender-horned</b> <b>gazelle,</b> and hawksbill turtle. The Sahara oryx has become extinct in the wild.|$|E
50|$|While {{details are}} {{difficult}} to establish, some researchers believe Termit may be home to the last self-sustaining population of the critically endangered addax, which at one time made regular migrations from {{what is now the}} Aïr and Ténéré Addax Sanctuary {{on the edge of the}} Ténéré desert. Several hundred dama gazelle are noted here. Though the <b>slender-horned</b> <b>gazelle</b> had previously been reported here, it was unknown by 1999 if it was still found in the area. The Saharan cheetah is reported to be very few in number, about 10. They have adopted to the searing heat of the Saharan Desert and can survive without a perennial source of water.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the larger}} mammal species have been extirpated from Mauritania. Among the antelopes the Scimitar-horned oryx, addax, korrigum and dama gazelle are extinct, the bohor reedbuck, Buffon's kob, Dorcas gazelle and red-fronted gazelle are extinct and the {{bushbuck}} and <b>slender-horned</b> <b>gazelle</b> are of indeterminate status. In the area of Diawling National Park the last lion was shot in 1970 {{and there have been}} no sightings of manatees or hippopotamus in recent years. The Mediterranean monk seal has one of its last strongholds in the world in the coves along the Cap Blanc Peninsula near Nouadhibou. Common extant mammals include fennec fox, golden jackals, warthogs, African wildcats, Cape hares and patas monkeys.|$|E
50|$|The {{topographic}} and {{climatic conditions}} {{of the country has}} resulted in faunal species dominated by rare species such as African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), striped hyena, Northwest African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus hecki), waterbuck, African leopard (Panthera pardus pardus), West African lion (Panthera leo senegalensis), antelope, common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), scimitar oryx (Oryx dammah), hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus amphibius) in the Niger River, crocodiles, horned vipers, lizards, pythons, manatee, the endemic Nigerian giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta) which is endangered, the Critically Endangered dama gazelle, which is the national symbol of Niger (named meyna or ménas in the Hausa language) as well as Soemmerring's gazelle (Nanger soemmerringii), Grant's gazelle (Nanger granti) and <b>slender-horned</b> <b>gazelle</b> (Gazella leptoceros).|$|E
50|$|There are varying {{habitats}} in the ecoregion including sandy systems, rocky plateaus, wadis, depressions and mountains. Each {{has its own}} characteristic {{species and}} there is considerable endemism of both plants and animals in the area. Small mammals endemic to the Sahara area include the four-toed jerboa (Allactaga tetradactyla), North African gerbil (Gerbillus campestris), James's gerbil (G. jamesi), pale gerbil (G. perpallidus), lesser short-tailed gerbil (G. simoni), sand gerbil (G. syrticus), fat-tailed gerbil (Pachyuromys duprasi) and Shaw's jird (Meriones shawi). Larger mammals include the dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), mountain gazelle (Gazella cuvieri) and <b>slender-horned</b> <b>gazelle</b> (Gazella leptoceros). There {{are a variety of}} snakes and lizards, including two endemic species, desert agama (Trapelus mutabilis) and Natterers gecko (Tropiocolotes nattereri). There are few amphibians, Brongersma's toad (Bufo brongersmai) being endemic to the coastal region of North Africa. Among the bird species, the Houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata) and Nubian bustard (Neotis nuba) have decreased in numbers because of hunting pressure.|$|E
40|$|Parasite {{control in}} wild {{ruminants}} is based mainly on anthelmintics. The {{objective of the}} present study was to evaluate three parasite control programs in seven herds of captive wild ruminants in 3 consecutive years. In the first year, a biannual spring-summer treatment regime with fenbendazole at 7. 5 mg/kg body weight p. o. for 3 days was applied. The next year, an early-season treatment program with three administrations of fenbendazole at the same dosage at 3 -wk intervals was used. In the third year, an early-season treatment program with ivermectin (0. 2 mg/kg p. o. for 3 days), applied three times at 5 -wk intervals, was evaluated. Effectiveness of these control programs was assessed by fecal egg counts and by scores of body condition and fecal consistency at weekly intervals. Involved animal species were Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx), scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), <b>slender-horned</b> <b>gazelle</b> (Gazella leptoceros), Soay sheep (Ovis aries soay), ibex (Capra ibex), red deer (Cervus elaphus hippelaphus), and Nelson's elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni). With the spring-summer regime, fecal egg counts remained low during the first 5 mo, but from September onward, they slowly increased to significant levels in all seven herds. The early-season program with fenbendazole resulted in fecal egg counts near zero during the entire year in four herds but a significant egg shedding from August onward was noted in Arabian oryx, scimitar-horned oryx, and Soay sheep. The early-season program with ivermectin resulted in very low to zero egg shedding in gazelle, adult Soay sheep, ibex, red deer, and Nelson's elk during the entire grazing season, but failed to prevent high shedding in October in Arabian oryx and scimitar-horned oryx. High contamination of grassy pastures with infective larvae/eggs in the previous year or before the first treatment may explain failure of the treatment regimes in some herds...|$|E
