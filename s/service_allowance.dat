Out of all three categories random sample i. e. 50; 25; and 100 respectively were drawn using close-ended questionnaire. Prior to launch full scale field data collocation, the questionnaire was pretested so that non sampling error could be minimized. The parameters were qualitative and quantitative in nature such as the perceptions opinions policies type training programs gender divisions and number of training offered in a Calendar year. The inferential statistics such as correlations and t and p values with confidence intervals were used. Also, data has been presented using statistical tools such as means, standard deviation, percentages and likert scale. In the context of Pakistan, the study identifies some pertinent {{issues such as the}} of lack of accountability, lack of incentives, little hope of a career track, and motivation confront with education system especially the teachers. Moreover, these issues appear to be widespread resulting from the failure of the system itself (led by government institutions). Although, some {{attempts have been made to}} improve of institutions, these include ADB program in the mid 1990 â€™s that supported the establishment of the Provincial Institutes of Teacher Education (PITEs) and other outposts of training. The outcome of those programs is debated as much of these programs contributed for improving infrastructure instead of quality education through reformation processes. In fact, a majority of projects and programs implemented over the years have unfortunately directed their This research study critically assesses the impact of Teacher Education Reforms (TERs) in Germany and Japan. The reforms include range of training programs initiated for teachers to enhance their capability and capabilities in imparting higher education especially at classroom levels, these training were offered at certificate levels such as, PTC, CT, B. Ed, M. Ed. The results show encouraging outcome, for example, teaching standards in both Germany and Japan are compatible with countries like USA and France. The study also intends to relate experiences of both countries i. e., Germany and Japan with Pakistan. The purpose was to suggest the standards and mechanisms for Pakistan, especially, those that were designed while initiating teacher training programs in both countries. Energies at addressing the symptoms of the problems rather than correcting the root causes. The study reveals that the system of teacher training and follow-up in the field by assessment adopted in Germany and Japan could applied in Pakistan. Also, in order to improve education system like in Japan and Germany, the appointment of teachers be made through an independent body (i. e. like HEC). The teacher recruitment must be ensured on 100 merit basis not on compromises on quality or else on political influence. As such practices have been proved to be counterproductive in terms of ensuring quality education. Further, the minimum qualification for candidates applying for Primary School Teacher should not be less than Graduation; the test standard must be maintained considering future national needs in relation to primary education. The posting of teachers must not be done in their home district and a handsome salary package may be designed for teachers. The summer and winter bonuses should be announced, family allowance, for those who have dependents, remote area allowance, for those who serve in isolated areas, special <b>service</b> <b>allowance,</b> for those who engage in activities or special services. The cold and hot place allowance for those posted at more than normal hot/cold areas, short-term benefits provide medical insurance and cover employees' and their dependents' medical expenses for illness, injury, childbirth, etc. Long-term benefits include retirement plans and other annuities that are paid upon retirement and thereafter (usually monthly), or when employees become disabled or die. The findings of this study may be helpful for policy makers, administrators and teacher educators to improve the teacher-training programs. It may also be helpful for the prospective teachers as well as working teachers in developing positive attitude toward teaching profession. All the categories of respondents exhibit no significance difference in their perceptions on quality of teachers and teacher training approaches at various levels. Teacher training programs need reevaluation and reorganization to remove the drawbacks. The teaching staff of teacher training institutions needs to reevaluate their own attitudes towards teaching profession as well as their overt behavior towards the prospective teacher...|$|E

In the final chapter the impact of the Second World War on <b>service</b> <b>allowances</b> is reviewed. The thesis concludes that the Second World War had little impact on government treatment of prisoner of war families. At least in part, this is attributable to government perceptions of service families as a whole. During the course of the war, the need to ensure that servicemen performed as efficiently as possible led to a perceived duty {{on the part of the}} State to maintain their families. Once the conflict had ended, this responsibility devolved to the individual servicemen themselves. In addition, for prisoner of war families, the government had not encouraged servicemen to consider the possibility of being taken captive and make adequate financial provision for their families in this eventuality. Not until after the Korean War did the State acknowledge its responsibility to prepare both men and their families for the possibility of capture...|$|R

30|$|The large {{growth in}} both the {{application}} and enrolment into the federal disability insurance prompted a set of congressional legislative reforms in 1980 which formed {{the backbone of the}} federal government’s effort to define the scope and limit the growth of DI. SSA was required to review a specified percentage of State Disability Determination <b>services</b> <b>allowances.</b> This allowed for partial or complete take over from a State Disability Determination services (DDS) the function of making disability determinations if the DDS fails to follow federal regulations and guidelines or if the state no longer wishes to make the determinations. Therefore this required the agency to make own-motion reviews of Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) decisions (as opposed to per request of an appellant). Most notably, the reforms also required continuing disability reviews (CDRs) of DI benefits for non-permanently disabled beneficiaries at least every three years. In order to define the scope of improvement, the Reform Act also incorporated an amendment that was based on SSA’s policies on the evaluation of pain. The amendments also contained a number of provisions designed to encourage DI and SSI disability beneficiaries to return to work, including continuation of benefits while the beneficiary is in vocational rehabilitation, the disregard of certain work-related expenses, and facilitated reentitlement to benefits that were lost after returning to work. The new rules established the need for a standard of pain evaluation.|$|R

40|$|Many {{proposals}} {{designed to}} reduce federal budget deficits include retirement policy reforms that would delay workers’ access to retirement benefits or reduce the value of benefits to those who retire early. Such reforms would have adverse consequences for the economic well-being of older workers with health-related work limitations. In this paper, we explore a set of policy options that take a "work-support" approach-an {{earned income tax credit}} (EITC), an employment <b>services</b> <b>allowance,</b> and a health insurance subsidydesigned to encourage and help workers continue to work if they can. To arrive at a population that might be eligible for such benefits, we first develop a straightforward model to predict the likelihood that a worker reporting a health-related work limitation would experience economic hardship as a result. The model bounds the target population by excluding those who are not expected to experience financial hardship from earnings loss due to a health-related work limitation. It also demonstrates an approach to eligibility determination that would discourage gaming and support rapid eligibility determination-critical for a program designed to extend employment and prevent financial hardship. Using conservative assumptions about program costs, our most expensive program would have a per capita cost of $ 14, 600, or $ 11, 300 if the health insurance subsidy is viewed as an ACA cost. This can be compared to estimated mean annual benefits of $ 14, 855 in 2009 for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries age 50 and older, plus $ 11, 000 per year for Medicare after the 24 -month waiting period. Because of its more favorable work incentives, a work-support program is likely to reduce hardship more than a program that preserves existing benefits for the same workers at comparable cost and is likely to be no more difficult to administer. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{crisis of}} climate change has jumpstarted a renewed {{interest}} in environmental sustainability. The growing awareness of the problem and the ensuing intense search for solutions called for a scrutinizing reexamination of the relationships between transportation, land use, and greenhouse gas emissions. Major publications such as The High Cost of Free Parking by Donald Shoup in 2005, and Parking Management, Strategies, Evaluation and Planning by Todd Litman in 2008, have identified parking as a crucial link. Parking issues are intrinsic to planning because parking facilities are a major land use type that affects how we design and build our commercial and residential areas, as well as influences our travel behavior which directly affects the form of urban infrastructure demanded by society. The management of parking demand and supply is highly complex because of its political and controversial nature. This thesis studies parking comprehensively in order to provide a guide for Silicon Valley cities. The contents of this comprehensive toolbox include background information, overview of major strategies with local examples, suggestions for securing financial and human resources necessary for planning and implementation of parking policies, and an inventory and analysis of current policies of 22 Silicon Valley cities. Also included in the appendix is a presentation with illustrations summarizing the thesis, titled 2 ̆ 2 The Story of Parking”. This study recommends strengthening the language of existing, adopted parking policies and following up with appropriate implementation measures to decrease general parking demand in Silicon Valley cities. Cities can further manage their parking supply and demand by adopting new policies such as parking maximums, allowance of off-site parking with shuttle <b>services,</b> <b>allowance</b> of parking lifts, and improving accessibility of parking user information [...] More aggressive policies to adopt and implement include parking taxes, parking pricing, encouraging car share, and unbundling parking...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses unique firm-level panel {{data from}} Japan and {{provides}} new {{evidence on the}} possible impact on gender equality in the workplace of human resources management (HRM) practices. Specifically we consider a number of work-life balance (WLB) practices that are developed in part to enhance gender equality as well as performance-related pay (PRP) {{that is one of}} the most often discussed changes in the Japanese HRM system in recent years. Our fixed effect estimates indicate that daycare service assistance (onsite daycare services and daycare <b>service</b> <b>allowances)</b> has a gradual yet significant positive effect on the share of women in the firm's core labor force and the proportion of female directors. However, transition period part-time work is found to result in a decrease in the proportion of female directors (or exacerbating gender inequality in management). Turning to PRP, the fixed effect estimates suggest that a switch from the traditional wage system that rewards workers for their long-term skill development through on-the-job training within the firm to PRP that makes pay more sensitive to shorter-term performance will result in a fall in the proportion of female directors. We also find that the adverse effect on gender equality of PRP is fully mediated by having a more objective performance evaluation system; a more transparent decision making process; and a more systematic, explicit and formal training program. This finding can be interpreted as evidence pointing to gender discrimination in the workplace. In designing, developing and revising public policy instruments to achieve Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ambitious policy goal of "increasing the share of women in leadership positions to at least 30 % by 2020 in all fields in society," policy makers may need to pay particular attention to heterogeneous efficacy of specific WLB practices and the adverse effect of PRP as well as the mediating role played by management by objectives (MBO), information sharing, and systematic training program...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The use of {{temporary}} workers in organisations is {{for different reasons}} such as cost-savings and improvement of {{the flexibility of the}} workforce. The choice of using temporary workers instead of regular or full-time workers is driven mainly by the desire for competitiveness and success. Business organisations are willing to use temporary workers as efficiently and effectively as possible to achieve and maintain their competitive advantage. However, not all the companies using temporary workers are achieving competitive advantages. This research investigates the effective use of labour brokers by an engineering company. The aim is to find out the truth about the matter and make recommendations that will help the company utilise temporary employment services (TES) efficiently and effectively in order to compete successfully in the market. A qualitative research design was followed as a data collection technique or data analysis procedure that helped in the generation of data for the research. One-on-one interviews were conducted with four temporary workers placed in the company by the labour brokers and five workers who were placed by the labour broker but who have recently been employed permanently by the company. In addition a Human Resources (HR) Manager of the company was also interviewed about using the labour brokers’ and the reasons for choosing to use them. The Manager representing the labour broker supplying the company with workers was also interviewed. Having searched and carefully studied literature, and conducted research on the identified engineering company a conclusion was reached that the company sources all types of workers from TES to fill in vacancies left by permanent staff as well as employees who are temporarily absent from work due to illness, maternity leaves and other short-term absences. In addition the company is paying short-term employees the same rate as long-term employees. These employees also enjoy overtime work at the same rate, the shift allowances, and the inconvenience allowance like their permanent counterparts. However, temporary employees sourced from TES do not have all benefits that are enjoyed by the permanent workers such as medical aid, housing allowance, transport <b>allowance,</b> retained <b>services</b> <b>allowance,</b> and company-based rate of pay for all weekly-paid staff. TES pays the employees that are sourced to the company with the money that the company gives to it depending on hours worked and the rate of pay per hour.
