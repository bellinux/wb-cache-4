5|$|Over {{the next}} four seasons, Yorkshire failed to win the Championship, {{although}} they never finished lower than fourth in the table. The team displayed an unaccustomed weakness in bowling, particularly {{after the death of}} Roy Kilner in 1928. The effectiveness of the main bowlers was reduced by age and injury; only Macaulay remained at <b>something</b> <b>approaching</b> his bowling peak. However, his performances worsened each year. His bowling figures in the 1927 season were similar to his achievements in 1926, showing only a slight decline, but his total of wickets fell each season until 1930.|$|E
5|$|The changes seen {{in series}} VII were {{seen by some}} as a disappointment; while much slicker and higher-budget in appearance, the shift away from {{outright}} sitcom and into <b>something</b> <b>approaching</b> comedy drama was seen as a move in the wrong direction. Furthermore, the attempt to shift back into traditional sitcom format for series VIII was greeted with a response that was similarly lukewarm. There was criticism aimed at the decision to resurrect the entire crew of Red Dwarf, as it was felt this detracted from the series' central premise of Lister being the last human being alive. There are other critics who feel that series VII and VIII are no weaker than the earlier series, however, and the topic is the subject of constant fervent debate among the show's fanbase.|$|E
5|$|Senator Don Cameron of Pennsylvania {{purchased}} the Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House for $60,000 in 1887, and resided {{there for a}} time. Cameron expanded the home significantly, almost entirely rebuilding its interior. After the renovation, the front entrance opened onto a square entrance hall. A fireplace adorned the hall. Large rooms {{on either side of}} the entrance hall were used as office space. A broad staircase led from the entrance hall up to the second floor, where there were four large rooms. The rooms opened on to one another, permitting the second floor to be opened up into <b>something</b> <b>approaching</b> a single large ballroom. The windows on the second floor reached to the floor. An iron veranda ran around the entire second floor. The home contained a total of 30 rooms after the renovation. Cameron did not, however, renovate the exterior, which remained much the same as it always had. Henry Adams was a frequent guest of the Camerons, playing often with their daughter Martha to alleviate his bouts of depression.|$|E

25|$|A {{very fast}} bowler {{with the ability}} to cause {{problems}} even on docile pitches, Ted McDonald was the unexpected bowling sensation of the 1921 Australian tour to England. He and Jack Gregory caused <b>something</b> <b>approaching</b> panic among the England batsmen: John Evans' knees were allegedly knocking together when he went out to bat, and Andy Ducat was bowled when part of his bat, broken by McDonald's pace, hit the wicket. Where Gregory was able to swing the ball both ways, McDonald imparted vicious movement off the wicket. Like later fast bowling pairs, they were devastating in combination, taking 46 wickets in the series.|$|E

25|$|The {{solution}} to this problem throughout most of American history was to keep its standing army small, relying on augmentation from militias (the predecessor of modern-day Reserve forces, to include the National Guard) and volunteers. While armed forces were built up during wartime, the pattern after every war up to and including World War II was to demobilize quickly and return to <b>something</b> <b>approaching</b> pre-war force levels. However, {{with the advent of the}} Cold War in the 1950s, the need to create and maintain a sizable peacetime military force engendered new concerns of militarism and about how such a large force would affect civil-military relations in the United States. For the first time in American history, the problem of civil-military relations would have to be managed during peacetime.|$|E
25|$|At the time, books {{had been}} {{regarded}} with <b>something</b> <b>approaching</b> veneration, {{but by the}} mid-eighteenth century this {{was no longer the}} case. The rise of literacy among the general public, combined with the technical advances in the mechanics of printing and bookbinding, meant that for the first time, books, texts, maps, pamphlets and newspapers were widely available to the general public at a reasonable cost. Such an explosion of the printed word demanded a set pattern of grammar, definition, and spelling for those words. This could be achieved by means of an authoritative dictionary of the English language. In 1746, a consortium of London's most successful printers, including Robert Dodsley and Thomas Longman – none could afford to undertake it alone – set out to satisfy and capitalise on this need by the ever-increasing reading and writing public.|$|E
25|$|The {{visit to}} Bolton Wanderers was {{postponed}} after severe {{weather in the}} north-west left the ground waterlogged, so the next game was at home to Preston North End on 23 November. Wheldon, back to <b>something</b> <b>approaching</b> his best, scored twice from distance to lead 2–1 at half-time. During the interval, Preston's goalkeeper John Wright {{was found to have}} broken his wrist and could not continue. Lester turned the ball into his own net to bring the scores level, but despite the brilliance of Bob Holmes, playing on his own at back after Sandy Tait had gone in goal, Preston could not prevent Small Heath exploiting their numerical advantage. The third goal ended with ball, goalkeeper and all five Small Heath forwards in the net, after which Jones scored twice to make the final score 5–2. Walton, now playing at centre half, drew particular praise for his judgment and the quality of his passing. The two points gained took Small Heath off the bottom of the table for the first time.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN {{gave it a}} 6.5/10, saying that the [...] "episode felt very formulaic {{and a bit of}} a wasted opportunity" [...] Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave it a B, saying, [...] "it's weird to see a Family Guy episode that has <b>something</b> <b>approaching</b> an actual story [...] and even the cutaway gags were more muted than usual." [...] In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Ramsey Isler of IGN listed [...] "Brian's Got a Brand New Bag" [...] as [...] "remarkably unfunny, with lazy and unoriginal writing." ...|$|E

According to Carter, [...] "the {{idea that there is}} <b>something</b> <b>approaching</b> at the millennium, this series being produced I think four years {{before the end of the}} century, that we were headed toward something grave and foreboding". The name of recurring character Bob Bletcher came from an attorney Carter had worked with previously. Another name, Giebelhouse was another name Carter had gotten from his childhood years. Carter said [...] "This idea of the hard-boiled detective is a kind of cliché". But felt that the characters came [...] "very real to life", when compared to real law enforcement personnel.|$|E

500|$|Gervais {{has been}} praised by critics for his {{performance}} in the episode. In a 2012 article, Mike Bruno of Entertainment Weekly named Gervais one of the 21 best The Simpsons guest stars, and in 2007 Simon Crerar of The Times listed the performance {{as one of the}} funniest cameos {{in the history of the}} show. Gervais' character Charles was cited by The Guardians Johnny Dee as one of the most memorable characters from The Simpsons. The episode, on the other hand, has received mixed response. Larissa Dubecki of The Age gave it a negative review, commenting that [...] "this cross-pollination of stellar US and British comedies [...] gives rise to great expectations but there's a massive letdown in store for anyone hoping for <b>something</b> <b>approaching</b> even the middling efforts of the two comedic benchmarks." [...] She added that [...] "this effort proves that The Office and The Simpsons are the comedic equivalent of oil and water, with the former's wry observational style sitting oddly with the latter's pop-culture pie-eating competition." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1919 Monteux was {{appointed}} chief {{conductor of the}} Boston Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra was going through difficult times; its conductor, Karl Muck, had been forced by anti-German agitation to step down in 1917. Sir Henry Wood turned down the post, and despite press speculation neither Sergei Rachmaninoff nor Arturo Toscanini {{was appointed}}. At least twenty-four players of German heritage had been forced out with Muck, and orchestral morale was low. Shortly before Monteux took up the conductorship the autocratic founder and proprietor of the orchestra, Henry Lee Higginson, died. He had steadfastly resisted unionisation, and after his death a substantial minority of the players resumed the struggle for union recognition. More than thirty players, including two important principals, resigned over the matter. Monteux set about rebuilding the orchestra, auditioning players {{from all kinds of}} musical background, some of whom had not played symphonic music before. By the end of his first season he had restored the orchestra to <b>something</b> <b>approaching</b> its normal complement. He trained the orchestra to a high standard; according to the critic Neville Cardus, Monteux's musicianship [...] "made the Boston Symphony Orchestra the most refined and musical in the world." ...|$|E
500|$|The dress rehearsal, with Debussy, Ravel, {{other musicians}} and critics among those present, passed without incident. However, the {{following}} evening the premiere provoked <b>something</b> <b>approaching</b> a riot, with loud verbal {{abuse of the}} work, counter-shouts from supporters, and fisticuffs breaking out. Monteux pressed on, continuing to conduct the orchestra regardless of the turmoil behind him. Stravinsky wrote [...] "The image of Monteux's back is more vivid in my mind today than {{the picture of the}} stage. He stood there apparently impervious and as nerveless as a crocodile. It is still incredible to me that he actually brought the orchestra through to the end." [...] The extensive press coverage of the incident made Monteux [...] "at age thirty-eight, truly a famous conductor". The company presented the Rite during its London season a few weeks later. The Times reported that although there was [...] "something like a hostile reception" [...] at the first London performance, the final performance in the season [...] "was received with scarcely a sign of opposition". Before the 1913 London performances, Monteux challenged Diaghilev's authority by declaring that he, not the impresario, was the composer's representative in matters related to The Rite of Spring.|$|E

500|$|In 1954, Charles Patterson {{defended the}} poem and claimed, [...] "The meaningfulness {{and range of}} the poem, along with its {{controlled}} execution and powerfully suggestive imagery, entitle it to a high place among Keats's great odes. It lacks the even finish and extreme perfection of To Autumn but is much superior in these qualities to the Ode to a Nightingale despite the magic passages in the latter and the similarities of over-all structure. In fact, the Ode on a Grecian Urn may deserve to rank first in the group if viewed in <b>something</b> <b>approaching</b> its true complexity and human wisdom." [...] Walter Jackson Bate argued in 1962 that [...] "the Grecian Urn possesses a quiet and constrained composure hardly equaled by the other odes of this month and perhaps even unsurpassed by the ode To Autumn of the following September... there is a severe repose about the Ode on a Grecian Urn; it is both 'interwoven' and 'complete'; and within its tensely braced stanzas is a potential energy momentarily stilled and imprisoned." [...] In 1964, literary critic David Perkins claimed in his essay [...] "The Ode on a Nightingale" [...] that {{the symbol of the}} urn [...] "may possibly not satisfy as the principal concern of poetry... but is rather an element in the poetry and drama of human reactions".|$|E
500|$|Poppy's {{introduction}} to EastEnders in what Jody Thompson of the Daily Mail described as [...] "a bizarre and utterly irrelevant chat" [...] was criticised by Daniella Graham of the Metro, {{who said that}} [...] "viewers were left questioning why on earth anyone thought this pointless sub-plot was necessary". In contrast, The Press and Journal Derek Lord deemed Poppy to have been [...] "a welcome addition to the show"; he wrote that, [...] "as a double act, [...] no Morecambe and Wise, {{but at least they}} bring an element of <b>something</b> <b>approaching</b> humour to the otherwise soul-destroying drabness of the London soap". Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror labelled Poppy the [...] "Optimist of the week" [...] for her line [...] "I bet it's really nice here when they ain't having a funeral", and [...] "Delicate flower of the week" [...] for her [...] "That is so well tragic innit?" [...] when commenting on Tommy Moon's death. Stuart Heritage from guardian.co.uk said that Poppy made an impact in her two episodes, branding her as [...] "perhaps the greatest television bit-part character of the modern age". Heritage added that she had [...] "the name of a Bond girl, the hair of a Winkleman and the voice of a Katie Price robot running low on batteries"; describing her as [...] "electrifying", he hoped that she would return. Katy Moon from Inside Soap discussed Poppy's original two episode stint: ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{critics have}} responded {{positively}} to the pairing. Robert Canning of IGN {{said of the}} episode [...] "Silly Love Songs": [...] "The absolute best part of [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] was Puckerman's unexpected longing for Lauren Zizes. Actress Ashley Fink has been fantastic in her small role, delivering great one-liners with ease. She was equally strong in this, the first episode to truly give Lauren a larger role and fill out her character more. Heck, {{it was nice to}} even see her smile a few times. The casting on Glee has either been very smart or very lucky since so many background characters have shined as they've been given bigger parts. The Lauren and Puck pairing came with a lot of laughs, but just as much heart. Puck singing Queen's [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls," [...] induced a chuckle at first, then some toe tapping. But it was Lauren's reaction that truly made the moment: 'That's the first song you've sung to me and it made me feel like crap.' I can't decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I'm going to be rooting for Lauren." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club commented: [...] "For me, the episode's highlight was the very sweet, funny courtship between Puck and Lauren. This may be because the writers have trouble writing for a self-professed bad boy, even though his escapades are straight out of Archie comics and not actually all that “bad” at all. But it’s always fun to watch Salling sing, and it’s always fun to watch him be smitten. Fink ends up being a good match for him, chemistry-wise, as she projects a confidence and certainty that makes it immediately obvious just what Puck sees in Lauren. The storyline also played out like both characters had <b>something</b> <b>approaching</b> real feelings." [...] In the following episode, VanDerWerff found her relationship with Puck [...] "a lot less assured" [...] than before, but Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez deemed their scenes [...] "as endearing as they are unrealistic", and E! Online's Jenna Mullins wrote that [...] "the ice around [...] heart melted just a bit when Puck mouthed Lauren that little bit of encouragement at the start of her solo." ...|$|E
5000|$|Samoyeds' {{friendly}} disposition {{makes them}} poor guard dogs; an aggressive Samoyed is rare.

[...] With their tendency to bark, however, they can be diligent watch dogs, barking whenever <b>something</b> <b>approaches</b> their territory. Samoyeds are excellent companions, especially for small children or even other dogs, and they remain playful into old age. When Samoyeds become bored, they may begin to dig. With their sled dog heritage, a Samoyed is not averse to pulling things, and an untrained Samoyed has no problem pulling its owner on a leash rather than walking alongside. Samoyeds were also used to herd reindeer. They will instinctively act as herd dogs, and when playing with children, especially, will often attempt to turn and move them in a different direction.|$|R
