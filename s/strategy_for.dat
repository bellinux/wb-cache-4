40|$|Purpose. To {{identify}} {{strategies used}} {{by people with}} high cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) to function autonomously. A multidimensional concept of autonomy was used, with four dimensions: independence, self-determination, participation and identification. Methods. Qualitative methods were used, involving literature study and semi-structured interviews with eight individuals with high SCI who had been discharged from the rehabilitation centre {{for several years and}} were members of a sports club. Results. <b>Strategies</b> <b>for</b> independence included making independent functioning a personal challenge and learning from others with SCI. <b>Strategies</b> <b>for</b> self-determination included keeping oneself informed, setting personal goals and being assertive. <b>Strategies</b> <b>for</b> participation were making challenges out of barriers, planning and organizing, asking and accepting help, and dealing with reactions from others. <b>Strategies</b> <b>for</b> identification involved taking life as it comes and focussing on positive aspects of life. Conclusions. Different <b>strategies</b> are necessary <b>for</b> different dimensions of autonomy. Some strategies seem contradictory in terms of their effects on different dimensions of autonomy.
