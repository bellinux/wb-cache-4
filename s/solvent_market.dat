40|$|Widely {{available}} insurance {{within a}} well-functioning and <b>solvent</b> <b>market</b> {{has the potential}} to not only assist the recovery from hazard events; but also positively influence mitigation behaviour. However, the characteristics of current flood insurance models and their effectiveness vary considerably between countries. How flood insurance provision is structured, what losses are covered and excluded and how it is purchased all impact upon the effectiveness of the scheme for recovering from flood losses and ultimately how burden sharing is split between the at-risk individual and society. This study reviews international insurance provision (and compensation schemes) for adverse natural events. Each insurance model is described and its performance for aiding recovery as well as modifying risk behaviour examined. A number of criteria are used to evaluate these models including; degree of insurance penetration, coverage, insurability, equity, incentives for mitigation and impact on market solvency. The review also examines the role of insurance within a broader portfolio of flood and storm management. Recognising the balance between a focus on proactive management and recovery as well as public and private investment is critical to understanding the overall role of insurance within a country and wider lessons that can be drawn. This cultural and flood management context is fundamental to assessing the impact that flood insurance may have on community resilience. Where possible, the review draws on information about insurance trends and other data for the provision of cover for older people; although the availability of data specifically for this group is limited...|$|E
40|$|This study {{reviews the}} market {{opportunities}} {{for use of}} esters of rapeseed oils as solvents. Potential market uses and requirements are reported, along {{with a discussion of}} the technical properties required of vegetable-based solvents for comparison with conventional organic solvents. This report examines the opportunities as well as the constraints and barriers affecting uptake and further development of bio-solvents. There is increasing legislative pressure encouraging change and these driving forces such as legislation to reduce use of volatile organic compounds (VOC’s) and measures to control the use of hazardous substances in the workplace are reviewed and discussed. Estimates of market costs, and, where available, costs of commercially available products are used for comparison with conventional organic solvents. Vegetable oil derived fatty acid esters have a number of characteristics which suit their use in the solvent sector. Rape methyl ester has a high solvating capacity, due to its small ester group, but conversely, its long carbon chain length (predominantly C 18) leads to relatively high viscosity and its high levels of unsaturation restricts the natural life of the oil through oxidative degradation. The latter is only of concern where long term recycling and re-use are considerations (i. e. in cleaning dip baths). In the <b>solvent</b> <b>market,</b> there appears to be limited opportunity for use of rape fatty acid esters in the surface coating sector, which is increasingly converting to use of water-based formulations. Other vegetable oils predominate in this sector because of technical advantages in terms of drying time or ability to cost effectively produce alkyl resins. The second most important industrial user of solvents in the UK is the printing industry, both in ink formulations and in wash down solutions. Progress has been made in developing ink formulations and significant volumes are produced and used in the UK and Northern Europe, but use in the UK probably accounts for no more than 20...|$|E

40|$|The {{planting}} on degraded agricultural {{lands of}} eucalypts for leaf oil provides a commercial incentive for restoring original vegetation; a sustainable method of controlling groundwater and salinity; {{a product that}} is an environmentally benign substitute for a widely used solvent damaging to the ozone layer; and a mechanism for reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. With integrated tree crop systems and improved harvesting and processing technologies, the Western Australian wheatbelt could produce large volumes of high-cineole eucalyptus oil from mallee eucalypts.

5000|$|Given {{numerous}} health scares {{connected to}} early efforts in decaffeination using solvents such as benzene, trichloroethylene, and chloroform, the solvents of choice have become dichloromethane and ethyl acetate. Dichloromethane {{is able to}} extract the caffeine selectively and has a low boiling point. Although it is mildly toxic and carcinogenic, its use as a decaffeination agent is allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration if the residual solvent is less than 10 parts per million (ppm). Actual coffee industry practice results in residues closer to one part per million. Starting in the 1980s, ethyl acetate was introduced as a replacement to dichloromethane.

50|$|Isobutanol — Without any modification, {{isobutanol}} has applications as {{a specialty}} chemical and a fuel blendstock. In the fuel blendstock market, isobutanol {{can be used}} to replace high-value blendstocks, such as alkylate, and can be blended in conjunction with, or as a substitute for, ethanol and other widely used fuel oxygenates. In November 2010, Gevo became the first company to receive EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) certification for isobutanol as a fuel blendstock after meeting the EPA’s standards under the Clean Air Act. The global gasoline oxygenate market is approximately 40 BGPY, based upon data from the International Energy Agency (IEA). While isobutanol {{can be used as a}} replacement for ethanol, its product properties are significantly differentiated from ethanol. As a gasoline blendstock, isobutanol’s low Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), high energy content and low water solubility compared to ethanol make it a valuable product that can be sold directly to refiners and is compatible with existing engine and industry infrastructure, including pipeline assets. Isobutanol can also be sold for immediate use as a specialty <b>solvent.</b> This global <b>market</b> for butanol represents approximately 1.1 BGPY, based upon volume data from SRI.|$|R
40|$|The {{rationale}} underlying {{competition is}} that market forces are best at allocating resources and enhancing consumer choice and value. Further, the evolution and internationalization of financial services markets could significantly promote economic development throughout the world. Thus, moves to render {{national and international}} insurance markets more competitive should be encouraged, {{taking into account the}} level of development of each market and recognizing the necessity for reasonable safeguards to protect the public. In this respect, the World Trade Organization (WTO) Financial Services Agreement marked an important milestone in the evolution toward competitive markets. However, market access alone does not ensure vigorous, fair competition. Regulatory reforms also are needed. The next step toward structuring insurance markets that better serve the interest of each country's citizens is regulatory reform built on a set of pro-competitive principles designed to ensure competitive, <b>solvent,</b> and fair <b>markets.</b> This article offers such a set of principles that are designed to permit national insurance markets to better serve the public interest. These principles are not an argument for elimination of regulation. In fact, pro-competitive regulation requires a greater – not lesser – emphasis on solvency oversight, disclosure and consumer information, and market monitoring. An insurance market structured around these principles will be one in which regulation is adequate, impartial, and minimally intrusive and, importantly, in which the regulatory process is transparent.

40|$|PhDUnlike other {{financial}} services (e. g., {{services provided by}} a bank or a primary insurance company), reinsurers seldom deal with the consumers directly. This indirect relationship with the consumer results in the view {{that it is not}} necessary to regulate pure reinsurers to the same degree as primary insurers, because they deal only with other companies or individuals in the insurance business who are already subject to regulatory control. It is true that a reinsurer bears its own risk; however, if a reinsurer becomes insolvent or has not provided sufficient reserves to cover liability of payments, the stability of the primary insurer might be threatened and hence the interests of the insured parties. In the last decade or so, reinsurance markets have been dominated by a number of trends, which include an increase of the potential risk of liability of "longtail" catastrophe (e. g., earthquake, hurricane and flood) and significant uncollectible reinsurance recoverables due to legal disputes relating to contract liability. These factors have affected solvency margins of primary insurers. At the same time, there has been a rapidly growing concern respecting "finite risk" reinsurance and securitisation of insurance risk, which can be tailored more specifically to the needs of the insurers. With regard to emerging markets, reinsurance regulation currently tends to be based on local protectionism. This has impeded the diversification of insurance risk and has resulted in a shortage of capital capacity to cover further risks. In addition, trade barriers as to reinsurance have been gradually dismantled by the efforts undertaken by many international negotiations and organisations (e. g., WTO and OECD) in recent years. On the other hand, with insurance regulation being gradually built, internationally on a set of pro-competitive principles designed to ensure a competitive, <b>solvent</b> and fair <b>market,</b> the reinsurance market is becoming more competitive. In order to establish a sound and viable regulatory regime, emerging countries are seeking to implement regulatory reform based on several leading regulatory models which have been proved effective in developed countries (e. g., the UK and USA models). It is evident, however, that the attempts merely to copy the "readymade" law of industrialised countries will fail unless awareness of particular social, economic and legal differences are taken into account. The primary theme of this volume is that the traditional point of view that private reinsurers and reinsurance markets are not in need of governmental regulation is flawed. To the contrary, the reinsurers, reinsurance intermediaries and related reinsurance arrangements should be appropriately regulated to protect the solvency of primary insurers. Through comparative analysis of different sets of international regulatory principles and of experienced developed country models, this volume will develop and address these general regulatory issues. In order to provide and to enact a sound and viable regulatory system in emerging markets, however, such regulations should be adopted to suit the particular country circumstances and should not be imposed or copied en masse from existing models. In support of this proposition, the example of the Taiwanese reinsurance market will be used as a case study. Unless otherwise indicated, this volume speaks as of September 200...|$|R
