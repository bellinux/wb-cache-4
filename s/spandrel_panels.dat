25|$|The {{windows are}} {{a mixture of}} clear glass and {{translucent}} insulated glass panels that are fitted into dark grey colour-coated metal frames at random locations on the buildings façade. Covering the windows on the slanted wall are horizontal metal and glass solar fins whilst on the Snow Hill Queensway elevation, the solar fins are fitted vertically. Between alternate floors there are colour-coated metal <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|E
25|$|Abutting the {{northern}} {{side of the}} tower is the rectangular rear podium, which stretches {{the width of the}} building and comprises four levels (G, B1, B2, and B3) and a roof top deck (L1). The side elevations are pale yellow facebrick in stretcher bond with rhythmically placed square windows. The northern elevation has an egg crate of white-painted, concrete sun hoods sheltering large, aluminium-framed windows. The windows have <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels</b> featuring dark slates.|$|E
25|$|The former Main Roads Department Building {{is highly}} {{visible from the}} {{surrounding}} suburb and maintains an imposing streetscape presence. Modernist in style, the building's simplified sculptural form is distinguished {{through a variety of}} treatments, including off-form textured concrete, stone <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels,</b> facebrick, egg-crate screening and breeze blocks. The abstract, graphic layout of the forecourt and side gardens, including pond and entrance bridge, and; the use of high-quality Queensland materials and artworks in the public reception areas complete the design.|$|E
50|$|The portico has {{a central}} glazed double door with sheet bronze finish. Surrounding the door, the portico is fully glazed in bronze framing. There is a marble <b>spandrel</b> <b>panel</b> above door height with obscure glazing above this.|$|R
50|$|The southern, street facing {{elevation}} {{has three}} gabled bays with central stairs; the central, smaller bay is enclosed and forms {{the main entrance}} to the house. The bays either side have double square posts, with curvilinear valances, and a <b>spandrel</b> <b>panel</b> of timber battens above. The central bay also has valances, a smaller batten frieze, gable battening, and marbled timber door surrounds.|$|R
40|$|A {{full-scale}} unreinforced masonry (URM) {{wall with}} an opening was tested under in-plane lateral loading. The wall was first subjected to monotonically increasing displacements until a moderate damage level was reached. The damaged specimen was then cyclically tested up to {{almost the same}} maximum drift attained during the monotonic test to investigate the effects of previous damage on its nonlinear response. Finally, the masonry wall was repaired with inorganic matrix-grid (IMG) composites and subjected to a cyclic displacement-controlled test up to a near-collapse state. Most of the observed damage developed in the <b>spandrel</b> <b>panel</b> affecting both lateral resistance and strength degradation. Rocking of piers governed lateral stiffness and hysteretic response, which was characterized by low residual displacements and recentering behavior. The comparison between the experimental force-displacement curves demonstrated that the IMG strengthening system was able to provide energy dissipation capacity to the <b>spandrel</b> <b>panel,</b> restoring load-bearing capacity of the as-built wall, and delaying strength degradation that was indeed observed at larger displacements. Bilinear idealizations of force-displacement curves allowed the identification of displacement ductility, global overstrength, and strength reduction factor of the tested wall systems...|$|R
25|$|James Boone Lankershim (1850-1931), {{a wealthy}} wheat farmer and miller whose father owned {{much of the}} San Fernando Valley in the late 19th Century, hired {{architect}} John F. Blee to design the building. Constructed at a reported cost of $200,000, the building opened in 1907 and {{was considered one of}} the finest office buildings in the city. The lobby has a 22-foot ceiling, and the exterior is decorated with elaborate cornice work and <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels</b> with an incised diamond motif. Originally a six-story structure, two additional stories designed by Robert Brown Young & Son were added in 1911.|$|E
25|$|The school uses {{an early}} example of all-glass curtain walling called the Hill System. Rather than use the common opaque, blue <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels</b> on the façade, Cadbury-Brown chose instead to just use glass panels. The {{corners of the}} {{building}} are glazed whilst {{the top of the}} curtain wall at the roof edge is neatly finished without a projecting edge (although the final detail was realised in felt rather than as designed in steel). Although the fireproof cladding for the columns behind make the building frame less visible, the building has been compared to those by Mies van de Rohe. The design has been considered comparable to the Eames House and Hunstanton School by Alison and Peter Smithson.|$|E
25|$|Southland Center was {{the second}} major {{development}} in the northeast end of downtown {{now known as the}} City Center District. The original two buildings, completed in 1958, consisted of the 42-story (550ft) center tower, the Southland Life Building, and the 28 story (353ft) south tower, the 510-room Sheraton Dallas Hotel. Celebrities Johnny Weissmuller and June Lockhart appeared at the dedication ceremony in 1959. In early 1981, the 31 story (448ft) north Skyway Tower was added as additional office space. All three buildings are rectangular slab structures and surrounded by a common base. The facade was covered with curtain walls of glass and 1,000+ <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels</b> of light weight precast concrete faced with blue Italian glass mosaic tiles.|$|E
40|$|Quasi-static lateral loading {{tests were}} carried out on a {{full-scale}} masonry wall with an opening to assess the contribution of spandrels to the in-plane nonlinear behaviour of masonry walls. The wall response was first assessed through a monotonic test up to the attainment of moderate cracking in the spandrel. Second, the pre-damaged wall was cyclically tested up to about the same lateral drift reached in the monotonic test. Finally, the wall was repaired and upgraded through inorganic matrix-grid (IMG) composites applied to the spandrel. A cyclic test was then performed up to a near-collapse state. In this paper the experimental results are discussed with special emphasis to parameters that quantify the in-plane nonlinear response. In all tests the piers provided high displacement capacity through a rocking response. Both the load-carrying capacity and the post-peak strength degradation were affected by nonlinear behaviour of the <b>spandrel</b> <b>panel.</b> The IMG strengthening system provided high energy dissipation capacity to the <b>spandrel</b> <b>panel,</b> restoring the load-carrying capacity of the as-built wall, and delaying strength degradation at larger drifts. Low residual displacements and full reversibility could make the IMG strengthening system attractive for historic buildings...|$|R
25|$|The service core {{projects}} {{from the}} rear (northern side) of the tower with walls of painted concrete with off-form-patterned panels. The core fenestration is minimal, contrasting with the ample glazing of the adjacent northern elevation of the tower. The east and west elevations of the core have long, narrow ribbons of windows with high sills, and the north elevation has a column of small windows with a high sill and a <b>spandrel</b> <b>panel</b> of quartz aggregate. On {{the roof of the}} service core and the tower is a large, facebrick plant room and air-conditioning machinery.|$|R
50|$|The Tower Petroleum Building {{features}} Zig-zag Moderne motifs, {{one of the}} few buildings left in Downtown Dallas {{which features}} such designs. The building's facade is clad in limestone and has green <b>spandrels</b> <b>panels</b> between the windows. The upper floors of the building are set back twice from the shaft of the building starting with a three story set back from the 19th floor. At the 22nd floor, the top sets back again and this section is 2 stories in height. These setbacks occur on three sides of the building.|$|R
500|$|The {{exterior}} lighting scheme {{of the building}} was designed by Quentin Thomas Associates, and consists primarily of white LEDs color-temperature matched to the fluorescent lights used by the interior. [...] Along each floor, the corner <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels</b> feature upward and downward-facing 4,100K LEDs to create the appearance that {{the length of the}} building has been bottom-lit by spotlights. The only major consistently active color element {{can be found at the}} top of the tuned mass damper; a single row of color-changing LEDs that is programmed to commemorate special events. For example, the top would be colored pink for Breast Cancer Awareness Month.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} the {{building}} incorporates three setback features designed to provide visual continuity with the surrounding skyline, each reflecting {{the height of a}} nearby building. The first setback, {{on the east side of}} the building, aligns with the cornice line of the Wrigley Building to the east; the second, on the west side, aligns with River Plaza to the north and with the Marina City Towers to the west. The third setback, on the east side, relates to 330 North Wabash building (formerly known as IBM Plaza). However, some views distort the alignment of the second setback. The setbacks and rounded edges of the building combat vortex formation. The body of the building is raised [...] above the main Wabash entrance and [...] above the Chicago River. The building's Permasteelisa curtain wall uses clear low-emissivity coated glass and a curved wing-shaped polished stainless-steel mullion system that projects [...] from the glass line. It incorporates a brushed stainless steel <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels</b> and clear anodized aluminum.|$|E

50|$|The service core {{projects}} {{from the}} rear (northern side) of the tower with walls of painted concrete with off-form-patterned panels. The core fenestration is minimal, contrasting with the ample glazing of the adjacent northern elevation of the tower. The east and west elevations of the core have long, narrow ribbons of windows with high sills, and the north elevation has a column of small windows with a high sill and a <b>spandrel</b> <b>panel</b> of quartz aggregate. On {{the roof of the}} service core and the tower is a large, facebrick plant room and air-conditioning machinery.|$|R
40|$|Finite element (FE) {{simulations}} of lateral loading tests on a full-scale masonry wall with an opening were processed {{to investigate the}} observed rocking response before and after strengthening. The lateral drift of the piers and <b>spandrel</b> <b>panel</b> was decomposed in a part associated with both bending and shear deformations and another part associated with rocking rotations of end sections. FE analysis results show that: (1) the ratio between rocking rotations of the <b>spandrel</b> <b>panel</b> {{and those of the}} piers can be predicted through a simple geometrical relationship; (2) overturning moment can induce significant axial force variations in piers, changing their lateral behaviour. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that rocking response was not significantly affected by variations in fracture energies of masonry units and mortar, opposed to the case of individual solid masonry walls. Finally, a simplified analysis of individual piers and macro-element matrix analysis of the as-built sub-assemblage was performed. Several options in terms of pier effective heights, spandrel effective length, size/stiffness of spandrel-pier overlapping zones, and reduction of elastic properties have been tested against experimental and numerical results. It is shown that: (1) lateral drifts in uncracked elastic conditions can be predicted via equivalent frame models with rigid end offsets and different effective heights of piers, depending on their location and performance level considered; (2) reduction factors of elastic properties lower than those allowed by some national and international codes may be required to capture large rocking-induced lateral drifts...|$|R
25|$|The three central bays {{form the}} {{frontispiece}} of the facade, each of similar dimensions and created as an {{access to the}} interior court. Each bay contains a horseshoe arch approximately one-half {{the height of the}} facade and almost the full width of the bay. Above each arch, a decorative <b>spandrel</b> <b>panel</b> contains glazed mosaic tiles in intricate Moorish patterns. Within each bay, a horizontal band stretching between the concrete piers separates the spandrel area from the parapet above. The parapet is completely solid above the central bay, whereas the parapets of the flanking bays are articulated with open, semi-circular concrete forms. At this level, the concrete piers are decorated with vertical rectangular panels of glazed multi-colored mosaic tiles.|$|R
2500|$|Mary Fendrich Hulman Hall, was {{designed}} by Melvin B. G. Meyers, president of Bohlen, Meyer, Gibson and Associates, in a Mid-century modern style. Its design is similar to Owens Hall and Rooney Library. The building's vertical design includes [...] "spandrel panels and use of aluminum." [...] The exterior's rough-cut stone in <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels</b> is classically inspired.|$|E
2500|$|Minimalism was {{the design}} {{principle}} behind the tower. The largest possible {{panes of glass}} were used. There are no <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels,</b> and the mullions are minimal. Cobb added a geometric modernist twist by using a parallelogram shape for the tower floor plan. From the most common views, this design makes {{the corners of the}} tower appear very sharp. The highly reflective window glass is tinted slightly blue, which results in the tower having only a slight contrast with the sky on a clear day. As a final modernist touch, the short sides of the parallelogram are marked with a deep vertical notch, breaking up the tower's mass and emphasizing its verticality. [...] In late evening, the vertical notch to the northwest catches the last light of the sky, while the larger portions of glass reflect the darkening sky.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tower is}} the major {{component}} of the building, comprising 14 levels (B3 to L10) and a rooftop plant room and caretaker's flat (L11). The tower is a tall, narrow, rectangular block with a concealed timber-framed hipped roof clad with metal pan and rib sheeting. It is oriented with its long sides (the front and rear) facing north and south. These elevations are highly glazed with an external grid of white-painted, concrete sun hoods forming a shading [...] "egg crate". The hoods on the northern side project further than the south. The windows are large, double glazed aluminium framed casements and have <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels</b> inset with a chunky, white quartz aggregate. The window hardware {{has been removed from}} the sashes. The side (eastern and western) elevations are painted concrete, finely articulated with off-form-patterned panels. Largely windowless in comparison to the north and south, the eastern and western elevations have four columns of small, square aluminium-framed windows with opaque glass.|$|E
5000|$|Keigley Branch Bridge is a {{historic}} structure located northeast of Gilbert, Iowa, United States. It spans the Keigley Branch for 47 ft. [...] The Iowa State Highway Commission was re-formed in 1913 and they developed standard designs for smaller bridges. One of their designs was {{an alternative to the}} Luten arch. They were built throughout the state in the 1910s and 1920s. This is the oldest remaining arch bridge from that era. [...] The Koss Construction Company of Des Moines completed it in 1913 for $3,384.85. The bridge features a medium-span arch with concrete filled <b>spandrels,</b> <b>paneled</b> guardrails, a corbeled arch ring, and bi-chrome concrete detailing. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.|$|R

50|$|The block-long south facade has {{seventeen}} fenestration bays {{as defined}} by vertical recessed window and <b>spandrel</b> <b>panel</b> openings. Stylized pavilions at the southeast and southwest corners contain two-story glass and aluminum framed entrances. The vertical thrust of the recessed window openings is interrupted by a Greek key belt course at the fourth floor level and terminated by a carved frieze and projecting cornice {{at the top of}} the facade. The view of this facade has been compromised by the installation of a pick-up/drop-off hub for the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority's Metro bus system. This block-long facility's 1979 design consisted of a series of concrete, aluminum frame and tinted-glass kiosks of a futuristic appearance. Their location and design seriously detracted from the overall character of the building. A redesigned transit center opened in August 2006.|$|R
2500|$|Phase 2, {{also known}} as One Snowhill, {{comprises}} a 13 storey, [...] office building. There are three basement levels with car parking facilities and 12 floors of offices. The office building was designed by Sidell Gibson Architects, who were the concept architects, and also by Fairhursts. It was built by the Kier Group, who won the £66million contract in January 2007. The building has an overhanging, slanting wall, facing Livery Street car park. There is a colonnade at the entrance, the columns of which are faced with reconstituted slate-coloured stone whilst {{the roof of the}} colonnade is a dark grey colour-coated metal panel soffit.

2500|$|The {{residential}} {{tower was}} to be 42½ storeys tall consisting of one and two bedroom apartments with penthouse suites on the upper floors. It will be [...] tall, becoming the second tallest building in the city, behind the BT Tower, and the tallest residential tower in the city. The tower is slender and the curvature of the façade will respond to the changing effects of daylight. It will be covered in anodised aluminium panels, glass and polished concrete. The anodised aluminium sills will project [...] from the building. The service area will be concealed by fritted glass <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels,</b> which will also accommodate the extract vents. The columns will rise from a polished concrete base on the ground floor. The top two floors will be surrounded by a light-weight perforated metal screen. There will be a total of 332 apartments in the tower, 10% of which shall be designed to be wheelchair accessible. There will be a single central core containing lifts and stairs. The apartments will be sold on 125 year leases.|$|E
50|$|The Fulbright Tower, {{built in}} 1982 and {{designed}} by Caudill Rowlett & Scott Architects, is a 52-story tower constructed of steel with suspended concrete on metal deck floor slabs. The exterior wall {{consists of a}} ribbon window wall with granite <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels</b> and aluminum framed windows with insulated glazing. The <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels</b> are polished granite supported by a steel truss system. The interior wall surfaces are constructed of Italian flame cut Rosa Beta granite, quarried in Sardinia, mixed with Makore wood and stainless steel trim.|$|E
50|$|The main {{entrance}} {{and all of}} the bays to its left were added some 18 years after the store first opened, using a modified construction system. The complete building opened fully in 1928, and resultantly through the use of supporting <b>spandrel</b> steel <b>panels,</b> the scale of the glass panes within the {{main entrance}} could be greatly enlarged.|$|R
40|$|Full scale lateral loading {{tests on}} {{unreinforced}} masonry walls with an opening are presented. The main {{scope of the}} experimental program {{was to investigate the}} role of spandrels and their interaction with piers. The specimens were subjected to displacement-controlled quasi-static lateral force under constant vertical forces on piers and were composed by two piers connected by a <b>spandrel</b> <b>panel.</b> The contribution of the following spandrel configurations was investigated: (1) spandrel with wooden lintel above the opening; (2) spandrel with masonry arch above the opening and reinforced concrete bond beam at the top. A composite strengthening system was also applied {{on both sides of the}} first spandrel type to assess its effectiveness in seismic upgrading and quick repair/remedial measures during earthquake sequences. In all cases nonlinear behaviour of specimens was significantly affected by rocking of piers and heavy damage to spandrels, which allowed satisfactory specimen re-centring and large displacement capacity...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{specific}} {{building permit}} records {{have not been}} located, it appears that during its approximately 50 year tenancy, the J.Newberry Co. installed various improvements/alterations with significant alterations {{that appear to be}} circa 1950 and circa 1990. The circa 1950 alterations include the installation of terrazzo flooring, installation of corner entrance and exterior canopy, and installation of the structural glass <b>spandrel</b> <b>panel.</b> A number of these alterations are visible in photographs from the 1960s and 1970s. These photographs also indicate that the neighboring building on S. Broadway (445 S. Broadway) was also part of the Newberry's store. In a 1952 building permit, the owners of 445 S. Broadway were granted permission to [...] "construct ramp and steps into Metropolitan building". This record may mark the date that the neighboring building were connected although the openings are also depicted in the circa 1950 Sanborn map noted previously. The circa 1990 alterations may include the addition of the food court space and the opening {{between the first and second}} floors.|$|R
50|$|To {{announce}} the theatre {{portion of the}} tall Ambassador Building, Rapp and Rapp designed a monumental arcade of giant windows along Locust Street, wrapping the corner of Seventh. Thirty feet high, these windows were richly embellished with finely detailed terra cotta in Renaissance style. Highly modeled theater masks of comedy and tragedy were featured on cartouche pier and <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels.</b> The three floors of theater offices fronting Seventh Street were appropriately distinguished by terra cotta <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels</b> featuring regal pairs of sphinxes, Egyptian symbols of power.|$|E
50|$|The {{northwest}} elevation, fronting Fitzroy Street, has a brickwork facade with regularly spaced window {{units to}} the first three floors. The fourth floor has a long recessed panel containing metal framed glazing and <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels.</b> A recessed three-storeyed section, located on the northeast side of this elevation, has metal framed glazing and <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels</b> lighting an internal staircase. This section was intended to form the linkage to a proposed wing facing Fitzroy Street which was not constructed, and its end facade has reinforced concrete framing and brick infill. The roof of the corner section has a metal balustrade and houses a large satellite dish and plant.|$|E
50|$|The {{refurbishment}} of {{the building}} included most of the windows. Leaded glass windows were replaced with steel mullioned windows with concrete <b>spandrel</b> <b>panels</b> and new rendered masonry surrounds, while pointed arched windows to the side walls were replaced with triangular head windows.|$|E
50|$|The Stair Hall {{also has}} several moulded plaster archways. The {{polished}} cedar stair has moulded square balusters, carved newels and a <b>panelled</b> <b>spandrel</b> beneath. The stair is dog-legged, with leadlight windows to the landing.|$|R
50|$|The building's high gables {{and deep}} roofs with {{a profusion of}} dormers, {{terracotta}} <b>spandrels</b> and <b>panels,</b> niches, balconies, and balustrades give it a North German Renaissance character, an echo of a Hanseatic town hall. Nevertheless, its layout and floor plan betray a strong influence of French architectural trends in housing design that had become known in New York in the 1870s. High above the 72nd Street entrance, {{the figure of a}} Dakota Indian keeps watch.|$|R
50|$|The central {{pavilion}} of {{the building}} is divided into nine bays at {{the second and third}} floors. The two bays at either end are framed by unembellished pilasters. The remaining portion of the central pavilion is divided into seven bays by six reeded engaged pilasters. A limestone entablature runs along the perimeter {{of the building}} above the third floor. The entablature is enriched by incised octagonal plaques above each reeded pilaster on the northwest elevation and above each bay of windows on the northeast and southwest elevations. The plaques have an octagon at the center from which radiate reeded spokes at the four primary sides. This motif is compatible with the door detail of the lobby. The third floor plaque at each corner of the building is flanked by a decorative stand of three incised rods. Second and third floor windows are separated vertically by a cast bronze <b>spandrel</b> <b>panel</b> embellished with the same motif as the incised plaques. The simple cornice is ornamented by a fluted band spanning the perimeter of the building above the third floor. The projecting wings have slightly different embellishment. The corner window lintels feature a recessed block with a carved sunburst motif.|$|R
