5|$|As World War I {{continued}} in Europe {{and increased the}} demand for defense-related shipping, American-Hawaiian stopped its sugar service.

5|$|Tubman {{was busy}} during this time, giving talks to {{abolitionist}} audiences and tending to her relatives. In {{the autumn of}} 1859, as Brown and his men prepared to launch the attack, Tubman could not be contacted. When the raid on Harpers Ferry took place on October 16, Tubman was not present. Some historians believe she was in New York at the time, ill with fever related to her childhood head injury. Others propose <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> recruiting more escaped slaves in Ontario, and Kate Clifford Larson suggests <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in Maryland, recruiting for Brown's raid or attempting to rescue more family members. Larson also notes that Tubman may have begun sharing Frederick Douglass's doubts about {{the viability of the}} plan.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the anti-Semitic passages in her memoir were intended to be used as evidence that she was not Jewish; alternatively, <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> influenced by Ezra Pound's anti-Semitic radio broadcasts. Whatever the case, she did help a Jewish couple escape Italy, providing passage on a ship to the United States. By {{the end of the war}} her sympathies had again changed, and she saw the Allies as liberators.|$|E

5|$|Scholarly {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} about Hel's potential connections to figures appearing in the 11th century Old English Gospel of Nicodemus and Old Norse Bartholomeus saga postola, that <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> considered a goddess with potential Indo-European parallels in Bhavani, Kali, and Mahakali or that Hel may have become a being only as a late personification of {{the location of the}} same name.|$|E
5|$|The {{balance of}} Iowans {{activities}} {{over the next}} two years are unclear. <b>She</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in the half of the American-Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service.

60|$|Perhaps every man, whether {{married or}} unmarried, {{who has lived}} {{to the age of}} fifty or thereabouts, has seen some woman who, in his mind, is the woman, in {{distinction}} from all others. <b>She</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a relative; <b>she</b> <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a wife; <b>she</b> <b>may</b> simply <b>have</b> shone on him from afar; <b>she</b> <b>may</b> be remembered in the distance of years as a star that is set, as music that is hushed, as beauty and loveliness faded forever; but remembered she is with interest, with fervor, with enthusiasm; with all that heart can feel, and more than words can tell.|$|R
5|$|Austin and Laura {{married in}} 1896; L. D. was born {{around the next}} year. (L. D. was {{regularly}} referred to after the lynching as L.W. or Lawrence.) In 1900 the extended family moved to Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma. According to Jones-Sneed, Laura and Austin were listed in the 1910 census as having two children, L. D., aged 13, and Carrie, aged two. It is not known what became of Carrie. <b>She</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the baby one witness said survived the lynching.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{married his}} second wife, Ælfflæd, {{at about the}} time of his father's death, {{probably}} because Ecgwynn had died, although <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> put aside. The new marriage weakened Æthelstan's position, as his step-mother naturally favoured the interests of her own sons, Ælfweard and Edwin. By 920 Edward had taken a third wife, Eadgifu, probably after putting Ælfflæd aside. Eadgifu also had two sons, the future kings Edmund and Eadred. Edward had several daughters, perhaps as many as nine.|$|E

5|$|Prince of Wales was a {{transport}} {{ship in the}} First Fleet, {{assigned to}} transport convicts for the European colonisation of Australia. Accounts differ regarding her origins; <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> built and launched in 1779 at Sidmouth, or in 1786 on the River Thames. Her First Fleet voyage commenced in 1787, with 47 female convicts aboard, and she arrived at Botany Bay in January 1788. On a difficult return voyage in 17881789 she became separated from her convoy and was found drifting helplessly off Rio de Janeiro with her crew incapacitated by scurvy.|$|E

Bad blood temporarily surfaces between the two but is shortly resolved after Gigi Cestone dies of an aneurysm, thereby forcing Tony to reluctantly promote Ralph to capo.|$|E

5|$|According to legend, Murasaki {{retreated to}} Ishiyama-dera at Lake Biwa, {{where she was}} {{inspired}} to write The Tale of Genji on an August night while looking at the moon. Although scholars dismiss the factual basis {{of the story of}} her retreat, Japanese artists often depicted her at Ishiyama Temple staring at the moon for inspiration. <b>She</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> commissioned to write the story and may have known an exiled courtier in a similar position to her hero Prince Genji. Murasaki would have distributed newly written chapters of Genji to friends who in turn would have re-copied them and passed them on. By this practice the story became known and she gained a reputation as an author.|$|E
5|$|After {{teaching}} at the University of Washington from 1910 to 1912, Morgan completed a Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Chicago in 1914. Stieglitz supervised her dissertation. <b>She</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the only married woman to have received a Ph.D. in chemistry {{in the first few}} years of the 20th century. Despite the fact that married women were not generally welcome on university faculties (female professors were usually expected to resign when they married), Stieglitz agreed to write a recommendation letter for Morgan for a position at the University of Illinois. Stieglitz noted in his letter that the university should overlook Morgan's marital status because her husband was ill at the time.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} caught in the harbour during the Battle of Weihaiwei in early 1895, with Zhenyuan only {{partially}} seaworthy. They were unable to prevent the capture of the port's fortifications by the Japanese, and underwent nightly attacks by torpedo boats. Dingyuen was hit by a torpedo and began to sink. She was quickly beached, where she settled into the mud, and continued {{to be used as a}} defensive fort. Admiral Ruchang's flag was subsequently moved across to Zhenyuan. Following Ruchang's suicide, the surrender of the port and the fleet was arranged. Dingyuen was blown up by the Japanese forces, as they were unable to salvage her, although there is a suggestion following an eye witness account that <b>she</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> mined by the Chinese.|$|E
