40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{longitudinal}} exploratory research is to investigate the influence of four factors: proficiency levels, text types, times, and learning environments on the writing complexity, accuracy, and fluency of Saudi students majoring in the English language. Specifically, the study seeks to determine how and when the CAF constructs and sub-constructs of low- and high-proficiency Saudi EFL undergraduates in three learning contexts: traditional learning context (TLC), blended learning context (BLC), and online learning contexts (OLC), are affected longitudinally across two writing tasks (classification and argumentative) that differed in their level of complexity. Also, it intends to specify when and which of the three learning contexts: TLC, BLC, and OLC, {{will lead to the}} most/least increases or decreases in the CAF constructs and sub-constructs of the low- and high-proficiency Saudi EFL undergraduates across the two composition tasks. To answer such questions, 75 <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>university</b> <b>students</b> were recruited from the pool of two proficiency levels (low and high). Six groups of equal number of students were generated from dividing randomly the 45 Low-proficiency participants and the 30 high-proficiency participants. Each of these groups was exposed to one of the previously mentioned learning contexts and undertook three tests: pre-test, mid-term test, and post-test. The 450 students’ writings were analyzed according to 45 measures of CAF constructs and sub-constructs and by using two statistical tests: t-test and ANOVA. For the first question, the t-test results showed that the similarities and differences of effect on CAF constructs between the two writing tasks were observed to be group-specific as they were based on the proficiency levels, learning contexts, and timescales (i. e., short term and long term). In other words, depending on whether a construct in the two text types was influenced similarly or differently, such influence did not generally occur in a systematic way and across the same number and types of metrics for the same group, or even across the groups of the same or different proficiency levels in the short term and long term. The findings only lent partial support to Skehan and Foster’s Limited Attentional Capacity Model and Robinson’s Multiple Attentional Resources Model since some constructs increased (e. g., accuracy, lexical variation, and syntactic complexity) or decreased (e. g., lexical density, lexical sophistication, lexical variation, syntactic complexity, and fluency). There were many other cases which were beyond the predictions of the aforementioned researchers and their explanations on how the students’ attention is deployed while performing the complex task(s). For instance, altering task complexity led some constructs to remain unaffected (e. g., syntactic complexity, lexical density, lexical sophistication, lexical variation, accuracy, and fluency), equal increases and decreases or only increases (e. g., fluency), increases more than decreases (e. g., lexical variation), less increases (e. g., accuracy), or less/more decreases (e. g., syntactic complexity and lexical sophistication). In terms of the second question, the ANOVA test results indicated mixed findings because each of the three learning environments resulted in benefits in some ways. In the two proficiency levels, the TLC, BLC, and OLC had the same level of success/unsuccess in enhancing all the measures of some CAF constructs in both writing tasks in the short term and long term. Nevertheless, in the other CAF constructs, there was no uniform linear development or deterioration of all measures across the six groups. In each of these constructs, the differences between these groups emerged from one or more measures, but not from all measures. Each of these learning contexts stood alone in being the most or least successful in increasing some constructs. Nonetheless, this was dependent on the participants’ proficiency levels, text types, and timescales. This study provides several pedagogical implications and recommendations for academic research, EFL writing instructors at pre-university and university levels, and task-based investigators...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the strategies which first-year <b>Saudi</b> <b>university</b> <b>EFL</b> <b>students</b> used to derive the meaning of unfamiliar words while reading English texts. Using cluster sampling method, participants chosen {{to be included in}} the study consisted of six male and six female classes (120 male and 120 female students) of the preparatory year deanship students at King Saud University, 2009 - 2010. Following the administration of a vocabulary test as the instrument, descriptive statistics and ANOVA tests were used to analyze the collected data. Results revealed that the students were weak in using the right strategies in guessing the meaning of unknown vocabulary. The use of a combination of two or more strategies was found to result in a better correct guessing rate, but few students tended to use this technique. The results support the importance of practical training in when and how to use various strategies: students need to be given regular practice in order to learn how to use them most effectively. Highlighting the main strategies which students use to correctly derive the meaning of words, the findings indicate EFL teachers should train their students in the use of a variety of strategies for guessing the meaning of unfamiliar words. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} ten years, there has a {{research}} interest in morphological awareness, which refers to an individual’s ability to decode the morphemic structure of words and further analyze them. The current study {{is an attempt to}} investigate levels of awareness of <b>EFL</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>university</b> <b>students</b> and also to discover any potential relationship between their morphological awareness and successful reading comprehension. To this end, the researcher administered a modified version of Morphological Awareness Test (McBride- Chang et al. 2008) to 35 undergraduate students at the Department of Foreign Languages at Faculty of Arts and Humanities of Al Baha University in the academic year 2016 / 2017. The test included the analytic and synthetic aspects of word formation rules. Instruments of the study also included an adopted version of Reading Comprehension Test for Smart Choice Learners (Oxford, 2007). Results of the study indicated that the average score of the Morpheme Identification section (the analytic aspect of morphological awareness) was the highest among the students (M= 27. 11, SD= 6. 20) in comparison to the synthetic aspect of morphological awareness (M= 14. 66, SD= 11. 91). The students noticeably scored better in the Morpheme Identification Test (88. 57 %) than they did in the Morphological Structure Test (57. 6 %). The overall mean score of the Morphological Awareness Test was 41. 77 out of 68 with a considerable dispersion among the results (SD= 14. 63) with overall percentage (65. 71 %) which indicated that the students had intermediate awareness of word formation rules. In addition, EFL students scored better in the Inflectional affixes in both the analysis section (63 %, SD= 5. 32) and the synthesis section (50 %, SD= 9. 85) than they did with the Derivational affixes (59. 15 %, SD= 7. 38 in the analysis section, 46. 33 %, SD= 13. 72 in the synthesis section). Furthermore, there is high positive correlation between total students' scores on analytical aspect section of the morphological awareness test and reading comprehension test (0. 871) (0. 009). There is positive correlation between students' scores on synthetic aspect section of the morphological test and reading comprehension (0. 841) (0. 005), but it is weaker than that of the first section of the test. The total scores of students on morphological test positively correlate with their total scores on reading comprehension test (0. 869) (0. 005). The present study ended up with a set of pedagogical implications and recommendations to include training on rules of word formation in EFL curriculum so as to increase their morphological awareness and to develop their successful reading comprehension endeavors. Future research themes were also recommended such as the role of morphological awareness in tracing semantic irregularities to enhance learners' understanding of different English words and to explore the relationship between morphological awareness and other language learning skills including listening and speaking...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} uses of learning styles is that it makes it easy for teachers to incorporate them into their teaching. There are different learning styles. Three {{of the most}} popular ones are visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic in which students take in information. Some students are visual learners, while others are auditory or kinaesthetic learners. While students use all of their senses to take in information, they seem to have preferences in how they learn best. In order to help students learn, teachers need to teach as many of these preferences as possible. Teachers can incorporate these learning styles in their curriculum activities so that students are able to succeed in their classes. This study is an analysis of learning styles for Iranian <b>EFL</b> <b>university</b> <b>students.</b> Over 100 students completed a questionnaire to determine if their learning styles are auditory, visual or kinaesthetic.

40|$|ABSTRACT 	English {{language}} teaching {{is based on}} the analytical tasks approach by focusing on the tasks as the core unit of planning and instruction {{language teaching}}. These tasks are activities where the meaning is the main element associated with the world real life context. In the Indonesian <b>EFL</b> <b>university</b> <b>students,</b> especially in Akademi Bahasa Asing UMI, the fresh university students’ ability in reading English texts is still relatively low. This is caused by the reading coursebook used incompatible with the real world life. Besides, the coursebooks that the lecturers still use in teaching English were written for native speakers in English speaking countries. The aims of this research were to divelop the students’ coursebook and workbook based on task-based reading materials suitable for use in teaching a foreign language, to explore the effectiveness of the students’ coursebook and workbook developed to improve students' ability to understand the English texts, and to find out the students’ and lecturers’ responses to the students’ coursebook and workbook developed. 	 This type of research is the research and development of which study was developed based on qualitative and quantitative methods by using a four-D, define, design, develop, and disseminate. In collecting data, the researcher used questionnaires, observation, and documentation. The questionnaires were administered to the 25 fresh <b>university</b> <b>students</b> as the sampels of the 200 fresh <b>university</b> <b>students</b> registered in academic year of 2014 - 2015. The results indicated that the students’ coursebook and workbook based on task-based reading materials that have been developed were suitable for the use as the instructional reading materials for the Indonesian <b>EFL</b> <b>university</b> <b>students,</b> then the students’ coursebook and workbook which have been developed were effective for the use in improving the ability to understand the reading texts, and the students’ coursebook and workbook received a positive response from both the students and the lecturers. This has implications on the progress of the learners significantly after these reading materials were implemented a few meetings. The progress was shown by the test results of pair samples t-test of the p-value below 0. 05.

The participants were one instructor, two raters and an intact group of 46 EFL students attending the fourth year of five-year Teacher Training, Licentiate and Translation Studies Programmes in an Argentinian university. The subjects were administered a pre-test requesting them to write a summary-response before instruction. After a ten-week period of instruction following the genre-based approach, a post-test was administered. Two independent raters scored students’ summary-responses using an analytic scoring scale designed for this study.

40|$|Code {{switching}} is {{a widely}} observed but less studied phenomenon, especially in multilingual and multicultural communities. So, {{the present study investigated}} the status of grammatical code switching among Iranian <b>EFL</b> <b>university</b> <b>students.</b> Also, the role of the teacher in managing the code switching was investigated, too. Two classes including 96 participants from two different universities were observed carefully and the required data were collected. Analyses of the data revealed varying nature of code switching in both settings. Moreover, the obtained frequencies revealed the fact that among the four types of „trigger words ‟ only „proper nouns ‟ and discourse marker „OK ‟ remarkably were responsible for code switching in one setting, while „lexical transfer ‟ and also the discourse marker „OK ‟ lead to code switch in another. Meanwhile, four functions for code switching were determined, which included providing equivalents for the key word, showing humor, inspiring learners, and explaining the required assignments, as teacher‟s role in dealing with code switching...|$|R

Previous seminal studies have reported students‟ development of collocational knowledge and use of collocations regardless the difficulties students may encounter in learning collocations, specifically, Arab students. The present study focuses on students‟ collocational knowledge, particularly, Yemeni <b>EFL</b> <b>university</b> <b>students</b> who were attending an Intensive English Course (IEC) at UUM/Malaysia. The data was collected from only five Yemeni students (two postgraduate and three undergraduate). Those were the only Yemeni students who were attending the IEC. All of the participants were male students. The participants' collocational knowledge was tested by a Multiple-choice Collocational Test (MCT). The results of the statistical analysis revealed that participants' collocational knowledge was less than the expected. Moreover, the results concluded that students‟ lack of knowledge of collocations was due to the fact that collocations were not of a focus in teaching English as a foreign language in schools. The study also ended up with recommendations for future research...|$|R
