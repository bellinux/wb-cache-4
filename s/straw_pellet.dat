In the paper, {{in order}} to {{investigate}} the situation of impact on wet molding for straw of compressing speed and moisture ratio, {{and look for the}} inside law between them, closed compress experimental study on the wet molding for wheat <b>straw</b> <b>pellet</b> fuel was done by electrical universal material experimental machine and experimental provision made by oneself. Study on the impact situation for compressing speed and moisture ratio was done from pressure intensity, displacement and density of materiel. The result, which low compressing speed and low moisture ratio were propitious to wet molding, was gotten. The molding stage can be divided to loose stag, transitional stage, compressing stage. Partial elastic deformation mainly occurred In loose stage, and its mathematical model was linear equation. Elastic deformation mainly occurred In transitional stage, and its mathematical model was exponential equation. Plastic deformation mainly occurred In compressing stage, and its mathematical model was linear equation.

The compressive loading curves of dependencies of stress on strain were realised by the test stand Andilog Stentor 1000 (Andilog Technologies, Vitrolles, France). Certain mechanical parameters were determined, namely the initial force (force at 10 % of compress strain), force in maximum of loading curve, strain in maximum of loading curve, initial stress (stress at 10 % of compression strain), stress in maximum of loading curve and modulus of elasticity. Mean value of the initial force was maximal for mixed <b>straw</b> <b>pellet</b> samples 52. 49 N. Mean values of the initial force of the wheat straw samples and the rapeseed straw samples were smaller and almost identical 43. 58 N and 43. 12 N.

At present, China’s biomass densified solid fuel (BSDF) development lags behind previously planned target, main barriers of which are economic and policy support problems. Accurate case studies are key to analyze these problems. This manuscript takes Nong’an County in Jilin Province of China as an example to establish a techno-economic model to evaluate the economic performance of a CSDF-DHS under two policy scenarios. It calculates the economic performance under a benchmark market scenario (BMS) and the current policy scenario (CPS) and analyzes the influence of various policy instruments, including subsidies, carbon trading, and preferential taxation. The results indicate that: (1) The CSDF-DHS option is not competitive under the BMS or CPS compared to the traditional energy system based mainly on coal and liquefied petroleum gas; (2) Comparatively, the economic performance of corn straw briquette fuel (CSBF) is better than that of corn <b>straw</b> <b>pellet</b> fuel (CSPF); and (3) further policy support can make CSDF-DHSs competitive in the market, especially with subsidies for concentrated heating services and CSDF, carbon trading, and economic compensation to reduce the profit margin of enterprises, which can make both CSPF-DHSs and CSBF-DHSs competitive.

They are a group of substances which can disturb function of hormonal system of organisms including humans. Their poor removal at wastewater treatment plants (WwTP) were shown at various studies, thus they can reach the environment in water. A prospective way for the degradation of EDs at WwTP can be their removal by ligninolytic fungi. They are able to degrade lots of lignin-like aromatic substances because of their highly nonspecific enzymes. In this work growth and enzyme production capability of four ligninolytic fungal strains were monitored on three solid substrates (<b>straw</b> <b>pellets,</b> poplar sawdust mixed with <b>straw</b> <b>pellets,</b> oak sawdust with <b>straw</b> <b>pellets),</b> which may be suitable substrates for fungal growth in bioreactors for wastewater treatment.

Prior to the trials, odor differences between the two plant species, the two aromatic extracts, and the <b>straw</b> <b>pellets</b> sprayed with the two aromatic extracts were verified using sensory analysis performed by 30 human panelists. Since odor differences observed among fresh samples were still detectable in aromatic extracts and moistened pellets, the extraction method was considered effective in reproducing plant odors. Strawpellets sprayed with either distilled water (W) or ryegrass (R) or clover (C) aromatic extracts were used to assess flavor preferences of 12 female Rossa Mediterranea goats. Sprayed pellet preference was evaluated in two sessions conducted in two consecutive weeks. Each session consisted of three two-choice presentations performed on three consecutive days. In both sessions, food intake, proportion of food intake, time spent feeding, and proportion of time spent feeding were significantly affected by pellet type (0 : 05 > P > 0 : 001).

The measurements of emissions comprised carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO x), unburned hydrocarbons (C x H y), sulphur oxides (SO x) and flue dust mass concentration (by DINplus and isokinetic sampling methods). Comparison of experimental emission values with relevant quality labels (Blue Angel and Swan Mark) and standard (EN- 303 - 5) showed that the boiler satisfied the emissions requirements of Blue Angel, Swan Mark and EN- 303 - 5 when using wood pellets- 1 (except CO emission), reed canary grass and citrus pectin waste pellets as fuel at nominal load. The wood pellets- 1 yielded the highest boiler efficiency of 92. 4 %.

Rotary kilns are the favoured process reactor in many industries, given their potential to handle a wide range of feedstocks and provide good process control. This thesis investigates the potential to coproduce biochar and excess biofuels by slow pyrolysis in a pilot-scale rotary kiln. The work attempts to progress towards the ultimate aim of scaling up the rotary kiln and optimising its operating conditions to produce biochar of good quality along with an excess of useful biofuels. Experimental work, involving the development and application of new methodologies, was used {{to gain a better understanding}} of the process. The data gathered were then used to support preliminary numerical simulation efforts towards the development of a comprehensive process model. Five biomass feedstocks were considered: softwood <b>pellets,</b> miscanthus <b>straw</b> <b>pellets,</b> wheat <b>straw</b> <b>pellets,</b> oilseed rape <b>straw</b> <b>pellets</b> and raw rice husks. The granular flow of biomass feedstocks was observed in a short closed drum faced with acrylic and resting on rollers. All pelletized feedstocks displayed similar angles of repose, validating the use of softwood pellets as a model biomass for these feedstocks. Bed mixing, which can improve product uniformity, was slow under typical operating conditions, requiring 5 min to complete at 4 rpm for softwood pellets. Mixing quickened considerably at higher rotation rates. A digital image analysis method was developed to measure the distribution of solid residence times inside the rotary kiln. The mean residence time of softwood pellets ranged from 19 to 37 min under typical operating conditions, decreasing with increases in kiln rotation rate, but mostly unaffected by feeding rates. These findings show that kiln rotation rates must be selected to balance the residence time of solids inside the kiln with bed mixing levels. Thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry were performed on samples of ground softwood pellets under five different heating profiles to study the kinetics and heat flows of the pyrolysis process. Both exothermic and endothermic regions were identified, with most reactions taking place between 250 °C and 500 °C. Results suggest that exothermic pyrolysis reactions can be promoted by altering the process heating rate, thereby improving net biofuel yield from the process. The thermogravimetric data collected was used to develop a distributed activation energy model (DAEM) of the kinetics of softwood pellet pyrolysis for integration into a comprehensive model of the process. The applicability of the kinetic model to large-scale processes was confirmed using a simplified process model developed to simulate biomass pyrolysis inside the pilot-scale rotary kiln. Although crude, the simplified process model produced sufficiently accurate estimates of char yield for preliminary design purposes. The simplified model also allowed important process parameters, such as kiln filling degree, solid residence time and heating rate, to be evaluated. A series of pyrolysis experiments was performed on the pilot-scale rotary kiln to evaluate the yields of biochar and biofuels and determine the temperature profile inside the kiln. This work required the design of a suspended thermocouple system that measures temperatures along the kiln, both in the gas phase and inside the solid bed. For most experiments at 550 °C, a region of high temperature gas and solids was observed, possibly indicative of exothermic reactions. Biochar yield varied from 18...|$|R
40|$|Activated carbon is {{generated}} from various waste biomass sources like rice straw, wheat <b>straw,</b> wheat <b>straw</b> <b>pellets,</b> olive stones, pistachios shells, walnut shells, beech wood and hardcoal. After drying the biomass is pyrolysed in the temperature range of 500 - 600 °C at low heating rates of 10 K/min. The {{activation of the}} chars is performed as steam activation at temperatures between 800 °C and 900 °C. Both the pyrolysis and activation experiments were run in lab-scale facilities. It is shown that nut shells provide high active surfaces of 1000 - 1300 m/g whereas the active surface of straw matters does hardly exceed 800 m/g which might {{be a result of}} the high ash content of the straws and the slightly higher carbon content of the nut shells. The active surface is detected by BET method. Besides the testing of a many types of biomass for the suitability as base material in the activated carbon production process, the experiments allow for the determination of production parameters like heating rate and pyrolysis temperature, activation time and temperature as well as steam flux which are necessary for the scale up of the process chain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- High {{levels of}} alkali {{chlorides}} in the flue gas can cause enhanced deposit formation and superheater corrosion during combustion of biofuels. These alkali chlorides mainly originate from potassium chloride (KCl). A challenge during combustion of biofuels is to simultaneously reduce NOx and KCl. The ChlorOut concept {{has been developed}} by Vattenfall to minimise deposit formation and corrosion. It consists of IACM, an instrument for on-line measurements of gaseous alkali chlorides, and a sulphate-containing additive that converts alkali chlorides to less corrosive alkali sulphates. The sulphate-containing additive is often ammonium sulphate, (NH 4) 2 SO 4, and, therefore, a significant NOx reduction is also achieved. This paper presents the results from {{a comparison of the}} conventional SNCR additives (ammonia or urea) and (NH 4) 2 SO 4 for reduction of NOx and/or KCl during combustion in a CFB boiler. The fuel consisted of either a mixture of wood chips and wood pellets with added PVC or with <b>straw</b> <b>pellets.</b> Of special interest was the influence of sulphation of KCl in parallel to the reduction of NO and if these processes interact. The results show that there are rather small differences in performance concerning NOx reduction between the additives...|$|R
