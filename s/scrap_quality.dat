40|$|The {{electric}} steel production {{is in line with}} the circular economy concept due to the reuse of scrap. However, being energy intensive industries with a significant environmental impact, {{electric steel}}works can increase their competitiveness and environmental sustainability through an adequate management of resource and energy.

Moreover, the developed simulations pointed out that the removal of Fe-alloy addition during EAF tapping allows reducing slag and improving the yield by preserving also the steel quality while slightly increasing the electric energy consumption: in countries where the price and the emissions related to the production of electricity are low, this can be a good compromise to improve the environmental sustainability of the sector.

40|$|On 9 October 2011, Council Regulation 333 / 2011 {{came into}} force {{establishing}} criteria by which scrap from iron and steel, aluminium and aluminium alloys could {{cease to be}} regulated as waste. This study examines the impacts of the Regulation on scrap availability, trade flows, prices, administrative requirements and environment or human health incidents. Because no data currently distinguishes between waste and end-of-waste compliant scrap, information was collected from the EU Competent Authorities and industry using detailed surveys. Across Europe, approximately 250 companies provided responses to the industry survey (representing approximately {{one quarter of the}} membership of the scrap industry associations), with a further 15 submissions from industry associations and 25 from Competent Authorities, although the survey responses were notably skewed towards Italy. The results of the study show that more than 1, 100 scrap industry companies are already using the end-of-waste criteria across Europe. Uptake is most pronounced in Italy, where over 1, 000 scrap companies generate end-of-waste compliant scrap. This rapid uptake in Italy {{is due in part to}} a specific legal framework on secondary raw materials already in place before the introduction of the end-of-waste criteria. In the rest of Europe there are a further 100 scrap companies active in end-of-waste scrap. In terms of the quantity of end-of-waste compliant scrap available on the market, this study estimates that, as a lower bound, at least 15 % of EU scrap steel and 10 % of EU scrap aluminium is compliant. Importantly, this study has found almost no evidence that end-of-waste has caused any negative impacts on the market, whether that be to <b>scrap</b> <b>quality,</b> availability/trade or on the environment. On the contrary, quite a number of the survey participants, both from industry and Competent Authorities highlighted the perceived benefits of the introduction of end-of-waste for metal scrap. These perceived benefits include: creating a simplified regulatory framework and offering companies greater flexibility and legal certainty. Some companies identified improved <b>scrap</b> <b>quality</b> and increased sales prices. At the expert workshop participants debated several ideas for a future monitoring system. One key conclusion was that there is no urgent need to revisit monitoring in the near future, due to the relatively modest rate of uptake outside Italy and the very few, if any, negative impacts observed so far. A repeat of the industry and authorities’ surveys in 2 - 3 years times was deemed to be the most appropriate way to monitor end-of-waste for scrap metal, and copper scrap could be added to the scope of that exercise.

40|$|Abstract. Aluminum has {{experienced}} significant growth in several sectors {{over the last}} decade {{as a result of its}} properties and performance attributes. Aluminum is being recognized by different sectors such as automotive, construction, aerospace, etc. as a one of the best candidate material for various applications. Increasing demand for aluminum-based products and further globalization of the aluminum industry have contributed significantly to the higher consumption of aluminum scrap for re-production of aluminum alloys. In automotive applications, for example, the opportunities for continued growth in powertrain and suspension applications plus lightweighting of body structures offer the potential for considerable further growth. Today, a large amount of the aluminum going into new products is coming from recycled products. This represents a growing "energy bank " of aluminum that will become available for recycling at the end of vehicles ' lives, and thus recycling is becoming a major issue, and it is essential to tackle this problem before it is too late. The future growth offers opportunity for new recycling technologies and practices to maximize <b>scrap</b> <b>quality,</b> improve efficiency and reduce cost.

40|$|Modern process logging {{systems for}} {{electric}} arc furnaces {{have the capability}} of storing large quantities of data, {{both in terms of}} variables and number of heats. The objective of this research is to evaluate how this data can be used for improvement of operating practices and optimisation of energy and scrap utilisation. In previous research projects, a process visualisation and monitoring system was developed and installed on four meltshops in Scandinavia. The system consists of a real-time database, a historical database, operator screens and a report generation system. By showing relevant information to the operators during the melting operation and generating reports based on the performance of the different operating teams, reduction of energy consumption, increase of productivity and reduced production costs could be achieved. Further analysis of data from the historical database {{led to the development of}} process optimisation tools for post combustion, hot heel practice, slag foaming and charging of scrap baskets. With the use of these tools, energy consumption and power-on time could be decreased further. However, steel scrap is the most important raw-material in electric steelmaking, contributing between 60 % and 80 % of the total production costs. Today the degree of which the scrap mix can be optimised, and also the degree of which the melting operation can be controlled and automated, is limited by the knowledge of the properties of the scrap and other raw- materials in the charge mix. In this thesis, multivariate regression methods have been used to develop prediction models for final chemical analysis of the steel, total electric energy consumption and metallic yield. The predictions are based on composition of the raw-material mix, total consumption of injected materials (like oxygen, oil, coal, slagformers) and initial condition of the furnace (hot heel composition). A prediction model for total energy consumption for melting of the first scrap basket based on continuous measurements of electrical parameters and wall panel temperatures was also developed. The models have been used to estimate some scrap properties (chemical composition, specific electrical energy consumption, yield coefficients), evaluate the efficiency of post-combustion and to estimate the optimal time to charge the second scrap basket. The results show that it is possible to provide estimates of the levels of tramp elements (Cu, Sn, As, etc.) and alloy elements (Cr, Ni, Mo, etc.) in commonly used scrap grades based on evaluation of commonly logged process data. To ensure that the estimates remain consistent with <b>scrap</b> <b>quality,</b> it is suggested that they be updated on a regular basis. It is also discussed how the estimates of scrap properties can be used for improved process control and monitoring of <b>scrap</b> <b>quality.</b> Godkänd; 2005; 20070102 (haneit) </p...|$|E

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1994 world market prices for industrial raw materials reversed their direction: after they had fallen by 4 percent in 1992 and by 14 percent in 1993, they grew by 8 percent {{during the first quarter}} of 1994. It is likely that this tendency will continue throughout the next few quarters. The price reversal has been especially strong for wool (1993 – 27 percent, I/ 1994 + 17 percent), pulp (1993 – 22 percent, I/ 1994 + 15 percent) and sawn wood (1993 – 25 percent, I/ 1994 + 9 percent) and non-ferrous metals (1993 – 16 percent, I/ 1994 + 11 percent). A number of reasons accounts for these price increases: next to the incipient cyclical upswing, reduced yields (e. g. of wool), plant closures (e. g. for pulp), or concerted capacity reductions (e. g. for aluminum) were responsible. Steel scrap was among the few raw materials whose price picked up significantly already in 1993 (+ 30 percent) and continued to rise in 1994. The reasons for this development can be found in quality deficiencies due to more extensive separate collections of <b>scrap</b> <b>qualities,</b> as well as in lower supply rates of a technological origin {{as a result of a}} higher share of continuous casting. At the same time, demand picked up in the US and Far East, as well as in Europe. It can be expected that this trend will continue: for 1994 and 1995 an increase of 7 percent per year is likely. The major reason for this price increase is that users will stock up during the cyclical upturn. The strongest price increases are expected for agrarian raw materials (around 15 percent each year). For cotton, the harvest of 1994 - 95 will be the third in a row that falls short of demand. It can also be expected that the demand for wool will be high, but price increases will be kept in check by a reduction in Australian stocks and the deficiency in demand from Russia. The recovery of construction activities in Europe will cause price increases for sawn wood. This trend will be corroborated by low interest rates and a substitution of tropical timber. Rubber will be in higher demand because of increased tire sales, but new suppliers like Vietnam or Cambodia will increase world supply. It can be expected that prices for non-ferrous metals will also increase during the forecasting period (1994 + 6 percent, 1995 + 12 percent). The increasing demand for copper will outgrow supplies, but a reduction in the LME stocks will prevent prices from rising too fast, at least initially. Even though it is unlikely that the planned capacity reductions for aluminum will become fully effective, an increase in demand will drive up prices. Tin prices will increase less, because important supplier countries are not included into the plans for reductions in production. Austria's import prices for industrial raw materials also reversed their trend during the first quarter of 1994 : after they had fallen by 12. 8 percent in 1993, in 1994 they increased by 8. 9 percent (valued in Schilling terms). The most important turn-arounds occurred for pulp, sawn wood, lead and nickel. The import prices movements for steel scrap lagged behind those in the world market. Further increases in the import prices of industrial raw materials are to be expected in 1994 and 1995. Preisumkehr auf dem Markt für Industrierohstoffe.

40|$|Analyses and/or {{scenarios}} of future industrial production, {{especially in the}} field of energy-intensive industries, can be useful for a variety of different task e. g. policy advice, energy demand modelling, resource availability/sustainability, and other. Especially future projection of the physical production differentiated on process level including the modelling of structural change and material strategies are of major importance to generate comprehensive and transparent scenario projections/results. In this context, another challenge is the modelling of this physical production in a hybrid model system, which means to link economic and demographic information provided by a macroeconomic model to the projection of physical production units, e. g. tonnes of an industrial branch. In this paper a short analysis of the historic steel production for selected European countries has been made, selected literature on material efficiency and recycling potentials is reported, and a methodology for the hybrid modelling of future steel use and production on process level as well as scrap availability is described. The paper shows that steel is an old energy-intensive product, facing a decreasing GDP intensity, with a trend to secondary production. This trend to secondary production makes the domestic scrap availability, but also trade in scrap and <b>scrap</b> <b>quality</b> an important factor which has to be considered when modelling future steel production.

The standard operating procedures are developed to be portable such that SPC can be used in various sections of the machining center. Findings include cost saving benefits and scrap rate reduction of approximately 50 % can be achieved for the entire machining center by the implementation of statistical process control. A training matrix is developed to train different people of the company on the concepts of SPC. Implementing SPC in a high volume machining center has proved to deliver value in reduction of <b>scrap,</b> <b>quality</b> improvement, ability to react to changes for the new hires and other benefits.

40|$|The steel {{industry}} is continuously facing higher demands on its products. This {{together with the}} increasing amount of lower quality raw material is a growing challenge for the industry. Steel manufacturers, such as SSAB in Luleå are continuously working {{to adapt to the}} higher demands and more challenging premises. This is done by continuously working to improve their processes in order to use the new and more difficult material to handle. This master thesis aims to improve the phosphorous refining capacity of the LD- converters at the SSAB steel plant in Luleå by adding limestone to the converters instead of lime as a slag former at the early stages of converting. In this work a number of reference charges were examined by extracting steel and slag samples from the process. This was done in order to set a frame of reference to be used further into the work. Tests were conducted by adding limestone together with the scrap before adding the hot metal to the furnace. Also some charges were interrupted at 30 % through the process in order to extract slag and iron samples. The main part of the results was analyzed using multivariate techniques such as PCA and PLS. Two PCA models were created for the reference and test charges respectively. The full dataset was examined using PLS and later parted into a model which only consisted of charges with a certain <b>scrap</b> <b>quality.</b> The charges that were interrupted at 30 % through the process were analyzed by a statistical hypothesis test, in which it was concluded that no effect could be seen on the phosphorous related variables concerning mean values between references and tests. The multivariable analysis concluded in models showing both increased and decreased phosphorous capacity of the converters when using limestone as slag former. Overall the models showed improvement in the phosphorous capacity apart from the endpoint phosphorous in the steel, which was positive in one model and negative in the other model. It was concluded that there exists effects of using limestone on the phosphorous capacity of the converters. However there was found that no improvement on the endpoint of phosphorous in the steel had occurred. The report also suggests further test to be conducted using limestone as slag former.

Besides, {{a number of studies have}} proven that there is a clear correlation between assembly ergonomics and product quality and that poor assembly ergonomics result in impaired product quality and in increased production costs. Many proactive measures have been made trying to prevent these problems such as training production staff in load ergonomics, workstation improvements and design changes in product and production development. Nevertheless, there are remaining difficulties in receiving acceptance for product and production changes because of poor assembly ergonomics solutions.

40|$|Slag {{formation}} plays {{a decisive}} {{role in all}} steelmaking processes. In top-blowing Basic Oxygen Steelmaking (BOS) i. e., in the LD process, an emulsion consisting of liquid slag, dispersed metal droplets, undissolved particles and solid precipitates will, together with process gases, form an expanding foam. Extensive research has defined the parameters that govern the foaming characteristics of BOS slag-metal emulsions. It is a well-known fact that certain process conditions in the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) will lead to excessive foam growth, forcing foam out through the vessel opening (mouth). This process event {{is commonly known as}} slopping. Slopping results in loss of valuable metal, equipment damage, lost production time, unsafe work environment and pollution. A literature survey covering the slopping phenomena has been carried out, as well as a deeper investigation into the causes behind slopping on the BOF type LD/LBE at SSAB Europe, Luleå, equipped with an automatic system for slopping registration using image analysis Good slag formation and foam-growth control in order to avoid slopping is primarily accomplished by taking preventive “static” measures. The most common pre-blowing operational conditions favouring foam growth and, hence, slopping were found to be linked to oxygen lance positioning, hot metal Si and Mn contents, <b>scrap</b> <b>quality</b> and large additions of iron oxide bearing materials. Improved slopping control may be achieved by developing oxygen lance control schemes with automatic adjustment of the distance between the lance tip and the metal bath (i. e., the lance gap) according to <b>scrap</b> <b>quality</b> and ore additions. If “static” measures cannot be effectuated, a set of in-blow slopping preventive measures is needed. For such “dynamic” measures to be effective, it is necessary to have a system for slopping prediction. Trials with vessel vibration measurements for indirect foam height estimation in industrial scale BOFs, type LD/LBE, have been carried out. FFT spectrum analysis was applied in order to find the frequency band with best correlation to an estimated foam height. The results show that there is a correlation between vessel vibration and foam height which can be used for dynamic foam level and slopping control, and this during the entire blow. The vessel vibration results have been tested against what is the perhaps most commonly implemented technique for dynamic foam height estimation and slopping control, the audiometric system. Parallel vibration and audio measurements have been carried out on 130 -tonne as well as on 300 -tonne BOFs. The results show that during stable process conditions there is good agreement between the two methods in regard to foam height estimation and that combining the two methods will provide a powerful slopping prediction and control system. A feasibility study has been carried out with the aim to describe the possibilities and limitations of multivariate data analysis, including batch analysis, for dynamic BOS process control, mainly in regard to slopping prevention. Two principal modelling approaches were tested. A central part of this PhD work is the performed emulsion characterisation and the subsequent investigation into the influence of emulsion mineralogy and morphology on slopping in the LD process. The results are based on the study of emulsion samples from trial heats conducted in a 6 -tonne pilot plant LD vessel. The main emulsion slag phase mineral species identified were di-calcium silicate, monoxides (mainly FeO, MnO and MgO), calcium ferrites and late-appearing tri-calcium silicate. The study also show that the iron oxidation state has a large influence on the emulsion mineralogy and morphology, as a higher Fe 3 + content facilitates the precipitation of calcium ferrites, raising the emulsion apparent viscosity and, hence, the foam index. The same effect is caused by higher MgO contents (i. e., at saturation), resulting in the precipitation of monoxide phase. However, large volume fractions of emulsion precipitates will not always lead to slopping in the LD process. A second “requirement” for excessive foam growth is a simultaneously high gas generation rate. Vice versa; an LD heat may very well slop at low volume fractions of 2 ndphase particles in the emulsion if the gas generation rate is sufficiently high. It is an indisputable fact that excessive foaming {{is one of the main}} features of the LD process, due to the practice of top-lance oxygen blowing, creating a highly oxidised slag, and heavy batch additions of basic slag formers, causing an initial formation of large quantities of precipitates. Therefore, preventing slopping is primarily a matter of tight process control, most importantly, control of the oxygen lance gap in order to reach a state of sufficiently high liquid MeO phase to minimise the emulsion apparent viscosity, but low enough to avoid over-oxidising and a high gas generation rate.

40|$|Slag {{formation}} plays {{a decisive}} {{role in all}} steelmaking processes. In top-blowing Basic Oxygen Steelmaking (BOS), i. e. in the LD process, an emulsion consisting of liquid slag, dispersed metal droplets and solid particles will, together with process gases, form an expanding foam. Extensive research has defined the parameters that govern the foaming characteristics of BOS slag emulsions. It is a well known fact that certain process conditions will lead to an excessive foam growth, forcing the foam out through the vessel opening (mouth). This process event {{is commonly known as}} slopping. Slopping results in loss of valuable metal, equipment damage, lost production time and pollution. A literature survey covering the slopping phenomena has been carried out, as well as a deeper investigation into the causes behind slopping on the BOS vessels, type LD/LBE, at SSAB EMEA Metallurgy Luleå, equipped with an automatic system for slopping registration using image analysis. Good slag formation and foam-growth control in order to avoid slopping is primarily accomplished by taking preventive "static" measures. Improved slopping control has been achieved by developing a new oxygen lance control scheme, featuring adjustment of the distance between the lance tip and the metal bath according to <b>scrap</b> <b>quality</b> and ore additions. If "static" measures cannot be effectuated, in-blow control measures are needed. For such "dynamic" measures to be effective, it is necessary to have a system for slopping prediction. In the early- 1980 s a system for foam level and slopping control, based on BOS vessel vibration, was temporarily installed and tested on one of the vessels in Luleå. Based on the experiences from these tests it was decided to re-investigate the vessel vibration measurement technique. Trials on industrial scale BOS vessels of type LD/LBE have been carried out. FFT spectrum analysis has been applied in order to find the frequency band with best correlation to an estimated foam height. The results show that there is a correlation between vessel vibration and foam height which can be used for dynamic foam level and slopping control. The vessel vibration results have been tested against perhaps the most common implemented technique for dynamic foam height estimation and slopping control, the audiometric system. Parallel vibration and audio measurements have been carried out on a 130 -tonne as well as on 300 -tonne BOS vessels. The results show that during stable process conditions there is good agreement between the two methods with regard to foam height estimation and that combining the two methods will provide a powerful slopping prediction and control system.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the current}} {{challenging}} issue in production is to deliver products {{in a more}} efficient manner by controlling, monitoring and centralising all intra-logistical processes. With the growing focus on sustainability, complexity grows even further as productions managers have to manage energy and material consumption, carbon footprint, and waste output in addition to Key Performance Indicators like process efficiency, asset utilization, <b>quality,</b> <b>scrap</b> rate and costs. Efforts to find the optimum for yield, quality, and speed or energy consumption individually often result in local optima, far from the ideal solution. Optimization must start at global bottlenecks within the plant or supply network, {{which can only be}} identified if overall process transparency is given. This project is included in a much larger project called PLANTCockpit (Production Logistics and Sustainability Cockpit) which is a FP 7 FoF ICT Collaborative Project. Here the aim of this project is to ensure the optimized use of available resource (personal, equipment, material and energy) for a scheduled product plan with continuous asset monitoring in discrete manufacturing industry. This issue is closed to real-world manufacturing problems and demands awareness from production managers on the holistic aspect of engineering assets availability. It includes the reliable detection and anticipation of performance deviations via monitoring the production and product related process, diagnostic of possible causes and predicting the time of occurrence. In such a context, PLANTCockpit project has been specially proposed to provide a decision support mechanism for an integrated maintenance and production management and consequently for asset optimization. In this project, a study of the existing methodologies for asset management and optimization will be performed. The outcome of this study will provide a novel approach for asset management and optimization. Furthermore, predictive maintenance and MIMOSA (Machinery Information Management Open System Alliance) standard {{will be one of the}} current issued to be tackled in order to prove improvement in the optimization for asset utilization.

40|$|In today {{competitive}} business environment, {{there are}} many manufacturing philosophies and best practices that organizations can make the most of, as a platform to achieve its overall business goals and objectives. This case study dissertation is thus an attempt to analyze fundamentals of operations managements and strategy, and {{the significance of the}} management tools {{from the perspective of a}} small manufacturing enterprise. It is with the proposition that with appropriate adoption and implementation of operations management philosophies and tools, the company under study will be able to enhance its manufacturing performances, i. e. improved delivery lead time, work-in-progress (WIP), inventory, cost of production and manufacturing <b>quality</b> (<b>scrap</b> and rework), and productivity level, and consequently achieved its strategic business objectives of further company expansion, in a more efficient and effective manner. The case study highlights importance of the management tools as a source of not only a competitive edge, but also as prerequisite to sustain in the rapid dynamic business environment. Based on the information acquired from the literature review and data from the field study, a conceptual framework consisting of the proposed manufacturing philosophies that will assist the company concerned achieved its business strategic goals in a more efficient and effective manner was developed for the company's considerations. Among others, operations management philosophies such as, Lean Manufacturing (LM), Just-in-Time (JIT) and Total Quality Management (TQM) are discussed in particular relevance to a small enterprise set-up, coupled with recommendations to tackle the change management issues so as to ensure higher level of success. This paper concludes with the view that management tools inherent in operations management and strategy discipline are by and large, applicable in the context of a small and medium sized enterprise as well. The case study demonstrated that with adoption of the appropriate management tools, the company concerned will be able to improve its manufacturing performance and enhance productivity level in a more cost effective manner...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2007. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Purchasing {{strategies}} {{impact on}} the value added to operations by the items included in the specific purchasing strategy. In mechanised mining operations the mining equipment {{plays a significant role}} in the production process as it is the primary production tools. This study reviews literature on the application of buyer-supplier collaboration to purchasing strategies in order to improve the value added to operations and focus on mining equipment purchasing. Most authors agree that the origin of this type of relationship is the adoption of the production management concept of Just-in-Time. Models for buyer supplier collaboration include one dimensional models such as the Traditional and Advanced Supply Management model, Models on the automotive industry, and Supplier partnerships. The one dimensional models mainly compare traditional market type supplier relationships to advanced partnership or relational type relationships. The models reviewed also include multi-dimensional models such as the portfolio management models and the strategic supplier segmentation model. These multidimensional models propose the adoption of a variety of supplier management models based on certain contextual parameters relating to the purchase and expands on the one dimensional models. The benefits of buyer-supplier collaboration include reduced inventory, increased inventory turnover, reduced <b>scrap,</b> increased <b>quality,</b> reduced costs, improved delivery reliability, design and productivity, reductions in lead time, and additional effort from suppliers. The risks associated with buyer-supplier collaboration include significant resource requirements, lack of support from suppliers, shifting of inventory, industry type exclusivity, higher switching costs, and increase in supplier's power. Buyer-supplier collaboration has certain requirements to be successful. These include a fundamental change in the purchasing strategy relating to supplier selection criteria, number of sources and time horizon, multi-dimensional evaluations, a move to single-sourcing and long term relationships. The development of buyer-supplier collaboration is dependant on similarity in industry and technology, prior experiences change, effective communication and information sharing, and experiential learning. Other success factors include two-way information sharing, top management support, shared goals, early communication to suppliers of specification changes or new products, suppliers adding distinctive value, total quality management initiatives and Just-in-time initiatives. The models for buyer-supplier collaboration form the basis of most discussions on implementation. The main implementation guidelines reviewed include the implementation of operational links relating to design, logistics and quality. The more complete implementation models include the model for Five phases in the development and evolution of purchasing partnerships. The most complete models are the portfolio management models to supplier relationship management which includes contextual analysis as well as relationship analysis and implementation. Portfolio management models were found to be the most applicable to application in industries other than manufacturing. The final part of this study applies the theory to mining equipment purchases. The theory and application of buyer-supplier collaboration were developed for the manufacturing industry and therefore several issues arise in the application of these approaches in the mining industry. No significant literature was found relating to the application of buyer-supplier collaboration to mining equipment purchasing strategies. Applying the portfolio management approach to the mining equipment purchase and suppliers, reveals that mining equipment purchases are strategic in nature and buyer-supplier collaboration is the applicable management approach. Several areas of possible value add were identified and include acquisitions costs, replacement parts, efficiency and productivity of mining equipment. The initial review of the implementation of buyer-supplier collaboration at a mining operation reveals early performance improvements in terms of service levels. The review also indicates the existence of some of the risks associated with this type of relationship, mainly the shifting of inventory to the supplier...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{manufacturing}} techniques enable ultra-precision surfaces to be fabricated {{with various}} complicated and large-area structures. For instance, the cost-effectiveness of Roll-to-Roll (R 2 R) manufacturing {{technology has been}} widely demonstrated in industries making high volume as well as large-area foil products and flexible electronics. Evaluation of these fine surfaces by an expensive trial-and-error approach is unadvisable due to the high <b>scrap</b> rate. Therefore <b>quality</b> control using in-line metrology of the functional surface {{plays an important role}} in the success of employing R 2 R technology by enabling a high product yield whilst guaranteeing high performance and a long lifespan of these multi-layer products. This thesis presents an environmentally robust line-scan dispersive interferometry (LSDI) technique that is suitable for applications in in-line surface inspection. Obtaining a surface profile in a single shot allows this interferometer to minimise the effect of external perturbations and environmental noise. Additionally, it eliminates the mechanical scanning and has an extended axial measurement range without the 2 π phase ambiguity problem by dispersing the output of the spectrometer onto the camera. Benefiting from high-speed camera, general-purpose graphics processing unit and multi-core processor computing technology, the LSDI can achieve high dynamic measurement with a high signal-to-noise ratio and is effective for use on the shop floor. Two proof-of-concept prototypes aimed at different applications are implemented. The cylindrical lens based prototype has a large lateral range up to 6 mm and can be used for characterisation of additively manufactured surface texture, surface form and surface blemish. The second prototype using a 4 X microscope objective with a diffraction limited lateral resolution (4 µm) is aiming at characterisation of surface roughness, micro-scale defects, and other imperfections of the ultra-precision surfaces. System design, implementation, fringe analysis algorithms and system calibrations are presented in detail in this thesis. Their performances are evaluated experimentally by measuring several standard step heights as well as Al 2 O 3 coated polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) films. The measurement results acquired using both prototypes and a commercial available instrument (Talysurf CCI 3000) align with each other acceptably. This shows that the developed metrology sensors may potentially be applied to production lines such as R 2 R surface inspection where only defects present on the surface are concerned in terms of quality assurance. Implementation of these prototypes offers an attractive solution to improve manufacturing processing and reliability for the products in ultra-highprecision engineering...|$|R
40|$|Each year, {{more than}} 50 million {{vehicles}} {{reach the end}} of their service life throughout the world. More than 95 % of these vehicles enter a comprehensive recycling infrastructure that includes auto parts recyclers/dismantlers, remanufacturers, and material recyclers (shredders). Today, about 75 % of automotive materials are profitably recycled via (1) parts reuse and parts and components remanufacturing and (2) ultimately by the scrap processing (shredding) industry. The process by which the scrap processors recover metal scrap from automobiles involves shredding the obsolete automobiles, along with other obsolete metal-containing products (such as white goods, industrial scrap, and demolition debris), and recovering the metals from the shredded material. The single largest source of recycled ferrous scrap for the iron and steel industry is obsolete automobiles. The non-metallic fraction that remains after the metals are recovered from the shredded materials (about 25 % of the weight of the vehicle) [...] commonly called shredder residue [...] is disposed of in landfills. Over the past 10 to 15 years, a significant amount of research and development has been undertaken to enhance the recycle rate of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs), including enhancing dismantling techniques and improving remanufacturing operations. However, most of the effort has focused on developing technology to recover materials, such as polymers, from shredder residue. To make future vehicles more energy efficient, more lighter-weight materials [...] primarily polymers and polymer composites [...] will be used in manufacturing these vehicles. These materials increase the percentage of shredder residue that must be disposed of, compared with the percentage of metals. Therefore, as the complexity of automotive materials and systems increases, new technologies will be required to sustain and maximize the ultimate recycling of these materials and systems at end-of-life. Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne), in cooperation with the Vehicle Recycling Partnership (VRP) and the American Plastics Council (APC), is working to develop technology for recycling materials from shredder residue.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that downstream mineral resource beneficiation {{has the potential}} to promote socio-economic growth in resource-rich nations. Many African countries, including South Africa, are thus prioritizing mineral beneficiation in their national policies and development strategies. However, policies with a strict focus on promoting downstream mineral beneficiation may {{come at the expense of}} other emerging sectors, as well as overshadow potential economic benefits of cross linkages into lateral sectors. Therefore, when presented with different beneficiation alternatives for a particular commodity, decision makers ideally need to base decisions on a systematic analysis of positive and negative impacts, if the sustainability benefits are to be maximised. Decision support frameworks (DSF) have been recommended for the promotion of sustainable development in the minerals sector, in particular for corporate and public policy development. They provide a structured and systematic approach to decision-making in complex situations, often characterised by multiple decision-makers with potentially conflicting views and objectives. Furthermore, the structured approach allows for transparent decisions to be made which take into consideration both the decision situation and stakeholder perspectives. Research thus far, on DSFs in the minerals sector, has been in the context of mineral processing decision situations which were primarily concerned with technology selection or process design. This dissertation investigates the applicability of decision support frameworks for sustainability performance analysis and comparison of decision alternatives, aimed at strategic planning in the minerals sector. More specifically, this entails the sustainability performance evaluation of decision alternatives as well as exploration of stakeholder perspectives regarding the relative importance of different factors in the decision-making process. The dissertation places particular emphasis on the different steps outlined in DSFs, rather than the final decision outcome, enabling analysis of the value that may be gleaned from the DSF as a whole, and from the individual stages. The application of decision support frameworks is demonstrated for the case of the iron and steel scrap industry in South Africa, with a particular focus on the potential for increased local beneficiation of scrap in steel mills and/or foundries. The export of scrap metal has been identified as a significant concern to some, as it is viewed to come at the expense of local beneficiation, hampering access to affordable and <b>quality</b> <b>scrap</b> for local processors. As such, decision-makers are faced with the question of which option for scrap metal processing has the most potential sustainability benefits. The sustainability performance evaluation was based on available industry data, and assumptions were made when data were unavailable. Interviews were conducted with key stakeholders in the industry, which included representatives of metal recycling, steel mills, foundries and institutions...|$|R
40|$|Each year, {{more than}} 25 million {{vehicles}} {{reach the end}} of their service life throughout the world, and this number is rising rapidly because the number of vehicles on the roads is rapidly increasing. In the United States, more than 95 % of the 10 - 15 million scrapped vehicles annually enter a comprehensive recycling infrastructure that includes auto parts recyclers/dismantlers, remanufacturers, and material recyclers (shredders). Today, over 75 % of automotive materials, primarily the metals, are profitably recycled via (1) parts reuse and parts and components remanufacturing and (2) ultimately by the scrap processing (shredding) industry. The process by which the scrap processors recover metal scrap from automobiles involves shredding the obsolete automobile hulks, along with other obsolete metal-containing products (such as white goods, industrial scrap, and demolition debris), and recovering the metals from the shredded material. The single largest source of recycled ferrous scrap for the iron and steel industry is obsolete automobiles. The non-metallic fraction that remains after the metals are recovered from the shredded materials - commonly called shredder residue - constitutes about 25 % of the weight of the vehicle, and it is disposed of in landfills. This practice is not environmentally friendly, wastes valuable resources, and may become uneconomical. Therefore, it is not sustainable. Over the past 15 - 20 years, a significant amount of research and development has been undertaken to enhance the recycle rate of end-of-life vehicles, including enhancing dismantling techniques and improving remanufacturing operations. However, most of the effort has been focused on developing technology to separate and recover non-metallic materials, such as polymers, from shredder residue. To make future vehicles more energy efficient, more lightweighting materials - primarily polymers, polymer composites, high-strength steels, and aluminum - will be used in manufacturing these vehicles. Many of these materials increase the percentage of shredder residue that must be disposed of, compared with the percentage of metals that are recovered. In addition, the number of hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles on the road is rapidly increasing. This trend will also introduce new materials for disposal {{at the end of their}} useful lives, including batteries. Therefore, as the complexity of automotive materials and systems increases, new technologies will be required to sustain and maximize the ultimate recycling of these materials and systems. Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne), the Vehicle Recycling Partnership, LLC. (VRP) of the United States Council for Automotive Research, LLC.

The recycling of polymers, other organics, and residual metals in shredder residue saves the equivalent of over 23 million barrels of oil annually.

40|$|The worlds {{crude steel}} {{production}} has seen a progressive growth from about 595 million tons in 1970 to 1527 million tons in 2011. This progressive growth, often attributed to the recovery of South East Asia from the economic and financial recession in 1998, {{has been accompanied by}} an equally progressive shift from the BOF to EAF as the mode of production of crude steel. The shift from the BOF to EAF has often been attributed to the latters low capital and operating cost coupled with its flexibility in the use of scrap. Accordingly, the demand for high <b>quality</b> <b>scrap</b> has soared, {{almost to the point of}} being scarce in most steel producing countries, a situation that calls for the development of novel technologies to produce alternative iron materials (AI) to supplement scrap in EAF steelmaking. Such novel technologies must not only be affordable from the economic point of view, they must also be environmentally benign in order to be able to meet the stiff national and international legislations on the environment. Anthracite and metallurgical coke are the conventional materials used for reduction of iron oxides and slag foaming in EAF steelmaking. In order to address the issues of cost, availability and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, alternative carbon sources are required to replace, at least partially, these conventional materials. Postconsumer plastics like polyethylene and end-of-life tyres (ELTs) contain both carbon and hydrogen, which are known reductants for iron oxide reduction. In the present study, the reduction of EAF slags containing FeO by metallurgical coke (Met Coke), high density polyethylene (HDPE), rubber tyre (RT), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and different blends of coke with the three polymers was investigated. The potential feasibility of utilising these polymers as reducing agents along with the kinetics of the reaction forms the central theme. Composite pellets were formed from EAF slags (47. 1 % FeO) and different blends of coke-polymer carbonaceous materials and were heated rapidly under inert environment (1 l/min argon) in a horizontal resistance tube furnace at four different temperatures  1450, 1500, 1550 and 1600 °C. The off gas produced from the reaction was analysed continuously by an infrared gas analyser attached to the system to monitor CO, CO 2 and CH 4 gases produced by the reduction reaction and the results were recorded in a data-logging computer. The rate and extent of reaction were calculated based on a mass balance for oxygen removal from the iron oxide and the content of reduced iron metal was determined by the following chemical analysis methods: 	LECO C/S analysis for its C and S contents and 	LECO Oxygen analyser for its O content. The gas phase interactions showed a reactive coke-polymer carbonaceous blend characterised by an improved generation of gaseous reducing species (H 2, CO, CH 4) in the furnace environment. The CO emissions from metallurgical coke showed lower concentrations in comparison to those from the Coke-polymer blends; however, the CO 2 emissions were generally higher than those of HDPE, RT, Coke-HDPE and Coke-RT blends but lower than PET and Coke-PET blends. At all the temperatures considered under this investigation, an improved rate of chemical reaction is seen when the coke was blended with each of the polymers. Calculated values of activation energies showed a progressive increase from coke as it was blended with the polymers. The relatively low activation energy value observed for coke compared to the blends and the polymers is consistent with less gas evolution and thus less stirring in the slag. Accordingly, mass transfer in the liquid becomes an important rate limiting step. As the proportion of polymer in the blend increases, gas evolution increases leading to increased stirring and foaming and the process shifts towards mixed control in which chemical reaction control becomes important as seen in the trends in the activation energy values. Therefore blending of the coke with the polymers has the effect of decreasing mass transfer effects and promoting the influence of chemical control. The percent reduction, time for complete reduction, level of carburisation and desulphurisation were calculated for each carbonaceous blend and the results were compared with those obtained by reduction of the iron oxide using Met Coke as reductant under the same experimental conditions. It was revealed that the blends, generally, performed better than Met Coke. A significant decrease in direct CO 2 emissions from the reduction process was observed when Met Coke was blended with two of the three polymers utilised for this investigation (HDPE and RT). However, blending of Met Coke with PET resulted in increased levels of CO 2 emissions; this is attributed to the presence of a significant amount of oxygen (33. 3 wt %) in the carbon-hydrogen backbone of the polymer. Consequently, based on direct CO 2 emissions to the environment, HDPE, RT, coke-HDPE and coke-RT blends are better carbonaceous reductants than coke. However, PET and coke-PET blends are not suitable as reductants beyond 10 wt% of PET in the carbonaceous blend...|$|R
