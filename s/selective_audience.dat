The band's musical eclecticism led to a cult following among its <b>selective</b> <b>audience.</b> During its career, the band has also released records sporadically, including Dig (1993), Low (1996), 203 Barriers (2003), and Tellurique (2005).|$|E
50|$|Among Japanese poets, Fujiwara no Teika {{defined the}} use of honkadori. His {{interpretation}} of honkadori was limited to a <b>selective</b> <b>audience</b> of aristocrats {{and members of the}} Japanese court who were well versed in all Japanese poetry and tropes. Therefore, for Fujiwara no Teika the context and use of honkadori were dependent on the reader. The skilful use of honkadori is then found in the balance between not being plagiarism, and still evoking the context of the original poem.|$|E

It was first shown in public on 3 May 1913 at Bombay's Coronation Cinema, Girgaon, where crowds thronged the roads outside the hall, as {{it marked the}} beginning of the Indian film industry. The film was so successful that Dada Saheb had to make more prints to show the film in rural areas as well. The film was a grand success and soon established Phalke as a producer and paved the way for the Indian film industry.|$|E
50|$|Television {{advertising}} {{offers the}} benefit of reaching large numbers in a single exposure. Yet {{because it is a}} mass medium capable of being seen by nearly anyone, television lacks the ability to deliver an advertisement to highly targeted customers compared to other media outlets. Television networks are attempting to improve their targeting efforts. In particular, networks operating in the pay-to-access arena, such as those with channels on cable and satellite television, are introducing more narrowly themed programming (i.e., TV shows geared to specific interest groups) designed to appeal to <b>selective</b> <b>audiences.</b> However, television remains an option that is best for products that targeted to a broad market. The geographic scope of television advertising may vary, from local or regional advertising through to national coverage, depending on whether public broadcasting or subscriber-based cable services are used.|$|R

This is an important group to capture as it is often these viewers whom advertisers wish to target. In reaction to this press release from TV3, RTÉ rebutted its claims stating that RTÉ One outdoes TV3 in far more demographic categories and that TV3's press release, [...] "In terms of the <b>selective</b> <b>audiences</b> focussed upon by TV3 in their release, it's clear this is a recent phenomenon and only pertains to a narrow sub-demographic of young viewers in this country.

[...] "This undermined the political power of the old society of landed and established religious interests was now followed by a further acceleration of capitalist-led social and economic transformation". [...] This means that to represent Scotland's more socialist outlook, buildings focused on serving the community as a whole, not just an elite or <b>selective</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|E

The first episodes were filmed at Domenican Republic, the other episodes were filmed in Koksijde and the studios in Lint. It aired {{for the first time}} on 18 September 2009. The first two episodes were screened for a <b>selective</b> <b>audience</b> at the casino of Koksijde at 15 September. It was the first Flemish telenovela of Vtm that had a unique story and was entirely created for Flanders. The story is about a young boy, David, who gets lost on an island.

50|$|A key {{objective}} is engaging digital marketing customers and {{allowing them to}} interact with the brand through servicing and delivery of digital media. Information is easy to access at a fast rate through the use of digital communications. Users with access to the Internet can use many digital mediums, such as Facebook, YouTube, Forums, and Email etc. Through Digital communications it creates a Multi-communication channel where information can be quickly exchanged around the world by anyone without any regard to whom they are. Social segregation plays no part through social mediums due to lack of face to face communication and information being wide spread instead to a <b>selective</b> <b>audience.</b> This interactive nature allows consumers create conversation in which the targeted audience is able to ask questions about the brand and get familiar with it which traditional forms of Marketing may not offer.|$|E
40|$|The central {{assertion}} {{of the vast}} ???going public??? literature is that since the mid- 1970 s, the traditional strategy of executive-legislative bargaining has been largely supplanted by direct appeals from American presidents to the American public. In their attempt to analyze the causes and consequences of this use of presidential speeches, scholars have relied almost exclusively on analysis of major national addresses rather than the significantly more frequent minor addresses. Indeed, it is these minor presidential addresses that are most responsible for the exponential growth in presidential speechmaking activity during the modern presidency. Analyzing data of every presidential speech between 1945 and 2004, I present compelling empirical evidence that the ???going public??? strategy can be best understood by concentrating more attention on these minor addresses, specifically the audience of these minor addresses. Using what {{is arguably the most}} pointed and extensive treatment of the audience of minor addresses to date and an illustrative case study, I document a clear {{increase in the number of}} speeches by presidents to what I classify as more selective rather than public audiences. In addition to descriptive accounts of this paradigmatic shift in presidential speechmaking, negative binomial regression and multinomial logit models identify leading conditions that influence both the frequency and choice of speeches to various <b>audience</b> types, particularly <b>selective</b> <b>audiences.</b> The study concludes with a discussion of the normative implications of the empirical evidence...|$|R
50|$|Berlo's {{model was}} further {{developed}} in 1973 by W. Schramm, who used relational model instead of linear. Schramm {{also used the}} effects and effects analysis components from Berlo's model and suggested Interaction component in relation with active, <b>selective</b> and manipulative <b>audience.</b> He argued that the most dramatic chande in the communication theory in the last 40 {{years has been the}} abandonment of the idea of passive audience.

"As {{commonly}} {{understood by}} gratifications researchers, the term [...] "audience activity" [...] postulates a voluntaristic and <b>selective</b> orientation by <b>audiences</b> toward the communication process. In brief, {{it suggests that}} media use is motivated by needs and goals that are defined by audience members themselves, and that active participation in the communication process may facilitate, limit, or otherwise influence the gratifications and effects associated with exposure. Current thinking also suggests that audience activity is best conceptualized as a variable construct, with audiences exhibiting varying kinds and degrees of activity." ...|$|R
5000|$|Another Smilin' Ed {{show that}} turned {{up for a}} while was a 15-minute program {{sponsored}} by the Purity Baking Company. Once again, Variety reviewed:"One of the veterans of radio, Ed McConnell mines the rich veins of American sentiment among those who are white-haired, churchgoing, rural and simple. He has a disarming style that has been analyzed in these columns on previous occasions and for other sponsors. This show differs only that he sticks to hymns and is necessarily serious in comment, with none of the semi-light folksy gab he could more appropriately introduce in a framework not devoted to ecclesiastical music alone. Aiming at a <b>selective</b> <b>audience,</b> the program will no doubt do well. McConnell puts it on a personal basis. Even while telling his listeners this is one program that will not [...] "be cluttered up with long-winded advertising" [...] he is sledge-hammering the important thought - his listeners need to support his sponsors. [...] "My friends who love me will support me by buying Tasty Bread" [...] he announces..." [...] "McConnell has a good Epworth League baritone and a down home rhetorical sloppiness. It's [...] "you-all" [...] or [...] "ya" [...] and no fuss. In fact, this is about the most calculatedly unpretentious program of the season. McConnell is probably the most humble man in America, making $100,000 or better, a year." ...|$|E

50|$|Technology advancements {{have created}} new and {{efficient}} ways for marketers to reach consumers, not just affecting modern media but also affecting {{the more traditional}} media. Traditional media is gradually losing effectiveness. Traditional media is becoming an increasingly less powerful mean of communicating with consumers and this change is driven by two key factors, audience fragmentation and ability to choose commercial content. Television, radio, magazines, and newspapers are becoming more fragmented and reaching smaller and more <b>selective</b> <b>audiences.</b> The rapid growth of communication due to interactive media, particularly the internet have caused {{the changes in the}} use of communication through media, with businesses preferring to use modern media over more traditional media methods. Consumers no longer accept the faith they once had in conventional advertising placed in traditional media. Consumers cannot avoid new and innovative ways of communication. The larger companies are realizing that to be able to survive in the 21st century, they must adapt to new modern ways of advertising. If they do not adapt, competitors in their respective industries will {{make it more difficult for}} their business to survive. Many marketers believe that traditional methods of advertising have become too expensive and is not cost-effective compared to modern media. Companies are looking to use lower-cost, more targeted means of communication such as direct mail, sales, promotions, marketing and sponsorships and the most common in modern times, the internet. The internet is an interactive medium that is becoming an essential part of the communication strategies. Traditional forms of marketing communications such as advertising are one way in nature, whereas new media allows marketers to perform a variety of functions. Interactive media such as internet, C-D-ROMS, kiosks and interactive television allow consumers to alter information and images given to them, make inquiries, respond to questions and make purchases. The transition of marketing communications from applying traditional media to modern media has significantly influenced the success of the communication process. Interactive media allows marketers to interact with the audience easier and more efficiently. It is a rapid procedure to communicate through interactive media to promote goods and services. Marketers can now channel their message to the target audience in a short span of time and a cost-efficient way. Advertising campaigns have the feature of adaptability with ease and innovations. It also allows marketing messages to go viral and response and feedback can occur at any time along the communication process, as it is an open and flexible method of channeling communication.|$|R
40|$|With {{increasing}} media {{choice and}} diverse media outlets, {{people have more}} opportunities to engage in selective exposure. The present study investigates this phenomenon {{by looking at the}} widely viewed anti–President George W. Bush documentary Fahrenheit 9 / 11. Using survey data gathered from a national sample before and after the opening of Fahrenheit 9 / 11, this study investigates the degree of selective exposure and the potential media effects occurring as a result of exposure to the film. The data provide evidence that <b>selective</b> exposure occurred—the <b>audience</b> for the film held more nega-tive attitudes toward President George W. Bush. This study then turns to evaluating whether the film had political effects. Results suggest that those who viewed the film had significantly more negative attitudes toward Bush compared to those who intended to view the film, even after controlling for demographic, political, and media use differences between the groups. Results also suggest that political discussion with friends and family did not moderate the movie’s effect, but that viewing the film may have inspired people to engage in more political discussion. Those viewing the film had higher levels of political discussion compared to those intending to view the film, even after controlling for a battery of other variables. Discussion of the results provides insight into the relationship between theories of media effects and selective exposure...|$|R
40|$|The {{world of}} luxury {{products}} {{for many years}} was reserved only for the <b>selective</b> and exclusive <b>audience.</b> It {{looked like it was}} impossible to experience it or to get in for someone from outside. Marketers of luxury brands have created such an environment where clients could feel exclusivity and enjoy timeless quality, values, history and heritage of the brand. It is very important to maintain the traditional values for luxury brands but in order {{to stay in touch with}} the target audience, luxury producers have to face and adapt to rapidly changing environment. There are a lot of debates about comparability of the Internet and luxury, as digital world is too impersonal comparing with core competence of luxury: exclusivity, outstanding experience and human touch in everything including craftsmanship, personal selling and customer relations. In current environment luxury companies cannot ignore the importance of the Internet as a communication and transaction tool and have to stay in touch with its target audience. The main contribution of this dissertation thesis is an analytical framework "features of importance for online luxury consumer satisfaction" that will help luxury marketers to understand online luxury consumers, their motivations, behavior and preferences. Additionally, framework presents the up-to-date data that can be executed while creating digital marketing communications strategy. The influence of content, social, process and technology gratifications on the online luxury consumer satisfaction was investigated. By incorporating the quantitative approach it was possible to make a deep analysis of the research problem. To obtain the necessary data the group structured questionnaire was used to analyze the proposed research model. A total of 133 respondents were accepted for the investigation. Analysis of correlation proved the positive relation between gratifications and luxury consumer satisfaction, even thought, proposed gratifications had different influence on the satisfaction. Content and technology gratifications had the most strong and positive influence on the satisfaction. However, from the obtained results it is visible that social gratification had the least important but still positive effect on the luxury consumer satisfaction. The obtained results are a valuable asset for the luxury companies as research revealed the main directions and themes on which luxury marketers should stress while creating online communication strategies...|$|R
