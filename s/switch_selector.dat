40|$|Abstract: Secondary {{distribution}} networks generally {{perform as}} well as its LV feeders are performing. The main problem that a feeder is experiencing would be the load unbalancing due to the stochastic nature of its individual single-phase loads: larger losses in certain phases accompanied by bad voltage regulation and voltage unbalance. In order to address this problem, it may be economical to install apparatus to automatically balance or partially balance the loads progressing {{from the end of the}} feeder towards the front using smart devices based on a three-ways <b>switch</b> <b>selector</b> and an artificial intelligence algorithm to minimize the neutral current. The main idea behind this paper is therefore to keep the three phases progressively balanced along the whole length of the line.

40|$|The 6800 / 2 uses our new A 2 {{processor}} board with socket space for 8 K bytes of ROM/PROM. This {{makes it possible}} to use the 6800 in applications where ROM programs are useful without purchasing an expensive PROM accessory board. The lA 2 board has a DIP <b>switch</b> <b>selector</b> that allows you to replace any 8 K block of memory above the RAM memory that extends to 32 K with memory external to the {{processor board}} itself. This lets you develop special pro-grams that will later be put in PROM in a normal RAM memory card where it can be modified and debugged. The A 2 board has a crystal controlled baud rate oscillator and a separate clock driver oscillator whose frequency may be changed with a programming resistor. The A 2 processor board gives you the maximum possible f lexibility in setting up a computer system. SWTBUG @ Monitor-The 6800 / 2 is supplied with our new SWTBUG @ monitor.

50|$|Unlike {{the motor}} driven, clutch {{controlled}} panel <b>switch</b> <b>selectors,</b> crossbar <b>switches</b> using the link principle required incoming and outgoing markers {{to find an}} idle path {{and set up the}} switch train for each call. Earlier crossbar exchanges had used the crossbar switch according to the selector principle, with one input and typically 100 or 200 outputs, similar to a stepping switch. 1XB pioneered the link principle, with each switch able to handle as many phone calls as it had inputs or outputs, typically ten. This innovation diminished the cost of switches, at the expense of more complex controls. The complexity of the circuitry challenged the art of circuit drawings, leading to the development of detached contact drawings, which in turn led to the application of Boolean algebra and Karnaugh maps.|$|R
