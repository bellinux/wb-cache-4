25|$|Following the Brundtland Commission's report, one of {{the first}} {{initiatives}} to bring scientific principles to the assessment of sustainability was by Swedish cancer scientist Karl-Henrik Robèrt. Robèrt coordinated a consensus process to define and operationalize sustainability. At the core of the process lies a consensus on what Robèrt came to call the natural step framework. The framework is based on a definition of sustainability, described as the system conditions of sustainability (as derived from System theory). In the natural step framework, a sustainable <b>society</b> <b>does</b> not systematically increase concentrations of substances extracted from the Earth's crust, or substances produced by society; that does not degrade the environment and in which people have the capacity to meet their needs worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The {{different}} effects honor instills upon men {{and women}} {{can be seen in}} the ancient world, where women and men played contrasting roles in society. Men displayed their honorable roles in public while women were restricted to the limitations of their households. While in public, women were required to avoid conversations with estranged men while only visiting places frequented by women. In the present Islamic culture, men hold a higher social status, but they also carry more responsibility in caring and providing for their family. If a man is single or childless his place in <b>society</b> <b>does</b> not waver or become lower. A woman should have a family whom she stays faithful to and respectful towards at all times. A man's actions will not greatly affect or hurt his family's standing like a woman's actions would. Women are perceived as vulnerable individuals who must be kept safe at all times. This aspect of a woman's characterization comes from her fertility and role within her family.|$|E

25|$|Borders {{and names}} for oceans and seas were internationally agreed when the International Hydrographic Bureau (IHB), the precusor to the IHO, convened the First International Conference on 24 July 1919. The IHO then {{published}} these in its Limits of Oceans and Seas, {{the first edition}} being 1928. Since the first edition, {{the limits of the}} Southern Ocean have moved progressively southwards; since 1953, it has been omitted from the official publication and left to local hydrographic offices to determine their own limits. The IHO included the ocean and its definition as the waters south of 60°S in its year 2000 revisions, but this has not been formally adopted, due to continuing impasses over other areas of the text, such as the naming dispute over the Sea of Japan. The 2000 IHO definition, however, was circulated in a draft edition in 2002 and is used by some within the IHO and by some other organizations such as the US Central Intelligence Agency and Merriam-Webster. Australian authorities regard the Southern Ocean as lying immediately south of Australia. The National Geographic <b>Society</b> <b>does</b> not recognize the ocean, depicting it (if at all) in a typeface different from the other world oceans; instead, it shows the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans extending to Antarctica on both its print and on line maps. Map publishers using the term Southern Ocean on their maps include Hema Maps and GeoNova.|$|E

Maier writes that this understanding {{is not limited to}} the language used, but also actions; this includes holding hands in public and drinking lemonade, activities which traditional Indonesian <b>society</b> <b>does</b> not involve. Student Hidjo also contrasts Dutch and Javanese peoples. Maier finds that, through its alternating events, the novel shows that the Dutch and Javanese are incompatible; Maeir sums it up as [...] "Javanese do not feel at ease in Holland, [...] Dutch do not feel at ease in Java." [...] According to Maier, the novel views the gap between the two cultures as [...] "unbridgeable".|$|E
500|$|Many social facts, however, have no {{material}} form. Even the most [...] "individualistic" [...] or [...] "subjective" [...] phenomena, such as love, freedom or suicide, would be regarded by Durkheim as objective social facts. Individuals composing society do not directly cause suicide: suicide, {{as a social}} fact, exists independently in society, and is caused by other social facts (such as rules governing behavior and group attachment), whether an individual likes it or not. Whether a person [...] "leaves" [...] a <b>society</b> <b>does</b> not alter {{the fact that this}} society will still contain suicides. Suicide, like other immaterial social facts, exists independently of the will of an individual, cannot be eliminated, and is as influential – coercive – as physical laws such as gravity. Sociology's task thus consists of discovering the qualities and characteristics of such social facts, which can be discovered through a quantitative or experimental approach (Durkheim extensively relied on statistics).|$|E

500|$|Some of the North-eastern {{islands are}} {{populated}} by the white-skinned Kargish people, {{who see the}} Hardic folk as evil sorcerers: the Kargish, in turn, are viewed by the Hardic as barbarians. The Kargish peoples have a distinct culture and geography: for example, they do not use written language, as they consider it an evil practice. The Kargish people have been described by scholars as being the analog {{of people in the}} United States; similarities include an organized religion, and a class system. This <b>society</b> <b>does</b> not believe in the equilibrium {{that the rest of the}} archipelago believes in, and does not believe in magic either. The Kargad empire is a theocracy; its monarch, the God-king, claims to represent the power of the Nameless Ones, described as the [...] "powers of the dark, of ruin, of madness". The society is depicted as militant, and patriarchal. Le Guin suggests that though the God-king relies upon the Nameless Ones and their high priestess to maintain his authority, he no longer believes in them.|$|E
500|$|The Monster, whose {{affections}} for {{the male}} hermit and the female Bride he discusses with identical language ("friend") has been read as sexually [...] "unsettled" [...] and bisexual. Gender studies author Elizabeth Young writes: [...] "He has no innate understanding that the male-female bond he is to forge with the bride {{is assumed to be}} the primary one or that it carries a different sexual valence from his relationships with : all affective relationships are as easily 'friendships' as 'marriages'." [...] Indeed, his relationship with the hermit has been interpreted as a same-sex marriage that heterosexual society will not tolerate: [...] "No mistake– this is a marriage, and a viable one... But Whale reminds us quickly that <b>society</b> <b>does</b> not approve. The monster– the outsider– is driven from his scene of domestic pleasure by two gun-toting rubes who happen upon this startling alliance and quickly, instinctively, proceed to destroy it", writes cultural critic Gary Morris for Bright Lights Film Journal. The creation of the Bride scene, Morris continues, is [...] "Whale's reminder to the audience– his Hollywood bosses, peers, and everyone watching– of the majesty and power of the homosexual creator".|$|E

The first arrivals came as {{temporary}} and seasonal workers, often returning to southern Italy {{after a few}} years. Other became permanent urban dwellers, especially when the First World War prevented international travel. From the outset they began to affect the cultural and commercial life of the area. As [...] "Little Italy" [...] grew it started to provide essential services for its members, such as a consul and the Order of the Sons of Italy, and an active fascist party provided a means of social organization.

In fact, Hijras, Alis, Kotis, etc.— {{the various forms of}} third gender that exist in India today— are all [...] characterized by the gender role of having receptive anal and oral sex with men. Sexuality between men (as distinct from third genders) has nevertheless thrived, mostly unspoken, informally, within men's spaces, without being seen as 'different' in the way it is seen in the West. As in some other non-Western cultures, it is considered more or less a universal aspect of manhood, even if not socially desirable. It is the effeminate male sexuality for men (or for women) which is seen as 'different,' and differently categorised. Men often refer to their sexual play with each other as musti.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Early European individualist anarchism was {{influenced}} by many philosophers, including Pierre Joseph Proudhon, Max Stirner, and Henry David Thoreau.

Stirner became a central figure of individualist anarchism through the publication of his seminal work The Ego and Its Own which is considered to be [...] "a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism." [...] The philosophy of Max Stirner supports the individual doing exactly what he pleases – taking no notice of God, state, or moral rules. To Stirner, rights were spooks in the mind, and he held that <b>society</b> <b>does</b> not exist but [...] "the individuals are its reality"– he supported property by force of might rather than moral right. Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw [...] "Union of egoists" [...] drawn together by respect for each other's ruthlessness. Thoreau emphasized the promotion of simple living, environmental stewardship, and civil disobedience were influential in European individualist anarchists.|$|E
