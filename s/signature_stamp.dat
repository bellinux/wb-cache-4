Individual letterboxes contain a notebook and a rubber stamp, preferably hand carved or custom made.

5000|$|Once {{the line}} was on the market, a {{vigorous}} merchandising campaign took place, with DC Comics and Kenner striving for the Super Powers logo to become ubiquitous. DC Comics produced three comic book mini-series featuring characters from the toyline, one during each year of the toyline's existence. The first series of comics in 1984 was plotted by Jack Kirby, who also provided covers, {{who went on to}} pencil the second series. The third and final series was penciled by Carmine Infantino. These comics were separate from the continuity of the regular comics featuring the characters. Hanna Barbera also produced two animated series (a refreshing of the venerable Super Friends concept), called Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show and The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians. Warner Home Video used the opportunity to issue episodes of Superman, Batman, Superboy, and Aquaman produced by Filmation in 1966 on VHS and Betamax video cassette in 1985 under the Super Powers label (and also as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of their sister company DC Comics), reissuing them again on VHS in 1996 (and were still available into the early 2000s {{until the end of the}} VHS format). Other tie-in products were produced, including lunchboxes, 3-D puffy stickers, party supplies, paintable figurines, Underoos, coloring and activity books (Secret of the Frozen City, Superman, Lex Luthor, The Joker, Batman, The Penguin, Wonder Woman, Villains, Superman and Batman, and Superman and the Super Powers), The Super Powers Anti-Coloring Book by Susan Striker, Stain-A-Sticker, Justice League of America Skyscraper Caper game, sunglasses, playhouses, belt buckles, sneakers, <b>signature</b> <b>stamp</b> sets, coloring play mats, drinking glasses/tumblers, model kits, soap, stain painting sets, calendars, Play-Doh sets, cube game, jointed wall figures, wrist watches, jigsaw puzzles (Jaymar and Craftmaster), Give-A-Show projectors, backpacks, gym bags, Valentine's Day paraphernalia, kites, pajamas, card games, sticker albums, sleeping bags, wall cling decorations, inflatable punching bop bags, bed sheets, clothes, windsocks, greeting cards, View-Master theatre sets, nut and fruit mix, sidewalk artist sets, temporary tattoos, SunShiners, galoshes, Nerf wrist flyers, duffel bags, lip balm, slippers, crayon sets, planners, school supplies, belts, baseball caps, flashlights, bumper stickers, pins, jewelery, embroidered patches, and posters.

40|$|Shoken（尚賢、a Ryukyu King）chose a {{path that}} {{strengthened}} the ties between his and the Nan（Southern） Ming（南明）administration in China {{at the expense of}} the Ryukyu Kingdom's relationship with the Qing Dynasty（清朝）. One reason was the longstanding affiliation between Ryukyu and the Ming Dynasty（明朝）over the course of 250 years. Another more important reason was that the Nan Ming accepted Ryukyu's request to restart the raw silk trade. The Southern Ming authorities made an effort to obtain the loyalty of Shoken, but militarily, at least, they could not invest him as the Ryukyu king. Japanese authorities（Satsuma 薩摩 and Edobakufu 江戸幕府）considered the Qing Dynasty a threat to Japan and admitted tacitly that Shoken chose the Southern Ming. After Shoken died, Shositsu（尚質）inherited the throne and adopted an ambiguous diplomatic policy toward the Southern Ming and the Qing Dynasty for reasons of economic pragmatism. Therefore, he did not wish for that the Qing ambassador to come to the Ryukyus and requested instead that the Ryukyu delegation bring back a <b>signature</b> <b>stamp</b> and an Imperial edict. The Qing emperor（Shunzhi 順治） declared that an ambassador would be dispatched to Ryukyu to clarify the authority of the Qing Dynasty, but after several years, it canceled the mission to Ryukyu because of the risks involved in marine transit. The Kangxi（康煕）emperor reverted to the policy of the Shunzhi emperor, positively promoted the policy of investiture of Shositsu, and ordered the Qing ambassador to travel to Ryukyu. Simultaneously, the Kangxi emperor sent an Imperial edict to Shositsu and indicated that the investiture of Shositsu had been delayed due to neglect of duty by the ambassador. Furthermore, Kangxi indicated that the crime of neglect of duty by the Qing ambassador had been punished and that representatives had been ordered to sail to Ryukyu to invest Shositsu. Satsuma and Bakufu feared that the Qing ambassador would force his own manners and customs on the Ryukyus but finally tacitly accepted the investiture of Shositsu as the Ryukyu king by the Kangxi emperor...|$|E
5000|$|Nanotransfer {{printing}} (nTP) (compare with microcontact printing) is {{a purely}} additive and high resolution metal printing technique. [...] It mainly {{relies on the}} principle of surface chemistry - chemically modified surfaces act as interfacial [...] "release" [...] or [...] "glue" [...] layers to aid in transfer printing nano-structured metal ink from relief features (aka [...] "stamp") to a surface of interest. The nTP can be simply envisioned as [...] "a process of <b>signature</b> <b>stamping</b> using rubber-stamp". In a rubber stamping, conventionally crafted signature/logo on a rubber stamp is transferred or replicated onto a paper surfaces using organic dye or ink while in nTP, nanolithographically created structures on silicon or PDMS [...] "stamp" [...] are transferred or printed on other surfaces such as glass or polymers using metal ink. nTP has found wide applications in various areas including electronics, chemical sensing, spintronics, and plasmonics. The technique has been successfully implemented for creating various functional structures having sub-100 nm spatial resolution. It was invented by Yueh-Lin Loo.|$|R
