The principal findings concern the dominance of the supply side of the labour market, especially the unfavourable decline in young labour force in the present difficult period, a special pattern of Czech <b>self-employment</b> <b>development,</b> a heavy tax burden on employees' income, and distortions of labour market caused by high labour costs (social and health insurance).

40|$|The {{self-employment}} rate includes entrepreneurs out {{of opportunity}} and entrepreneurs out of necessity. While {{the effect of}} opportunity entrepreneurs on economic development should be positive, {{there should be no}} or a negative effect of necessity entrepreneurship. We use a geographically weighted regression (GWR) approach to analyze whether the effect of <b>self-employment</b> on economic <b>development</b> is heterogeneous across European NUTS- 2 regions. We find that regions having a significant positive effect of <b>self-employment</b> on economic <b>development</b> in the GWR estimation have, on average, a lower self-employment rate than regions with a significant negative effect. The concept of equilibrium rate of entrepreneurship is applied in an attempt to estimate a level of the self-employment rate from which relatively more entrepreneurs are self-employed out of necessity than out of opportunity. We find that in regions where the self-employment rate is above the equilibrium rate, self-employment has indeed a negative effect, while in regions where it is below the equilibrium rate the effect is positive...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{tremendous}} diversity in the level and time-series pattern of the self-employment rate across countries. After documenting this fact with cross-section and time-series data on industrialized and lesser-developed countries, this paper presents and tests a series of hypotheses concerning the sources of this diversity. We show that the major explanation for this diversity is the stage of economic development. While the tendency for the self-employment rate to decline with economic development has long been recognized, this paper is the first attempt to estimate the statistical relationship between <b>self-employment</b> and economic <b>development</b> and to test an explanation for this relationship that is grounded in theory. We also show that the negative relationship between <b>self-employment</b> and economic <b>development</b> remains after controlling {{for a number of}} other factors. Although economic development is an extremely powerful force behind the secular decline in self-employment rates, the convergence of several factors in the 1970 s tended to stem the secular decline in the self-employment rate for many countries. Of the 23 OECD countries we examined, 15 had increases in the self-employment rate during the 1970 s or 1980 s. It is likely, however, that these factors are temporary and that self-employment will continue its downwards trend as per-capita wealth increases in the developed and developing world.

40|$|We {{know that}} {{entrepreneurs}} – {{at least those}} driven by opportunities – can contribute to economic growth, productivity improvements and competitiveness in national economies [...] But do they contribute to happiness on the country level? In other words, does the happiness of nations depend on its entrepreneurs? And what about happy nations – are they better places for entrepreneurs to start‐up new businesses? In this paper we survey the literature on entrepreneurship and happiness, and use various data sources, primarily from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, to find tentative evidence of an inverse U‐shape relationship between entrepreneurship and national happiness We also find a bi‐directional causality between entrepreneurship and happiness on a country level On an individual level however, national happiness is {{found to have a}} negative effect on the probability of becoming an entrepreneur. We conclude that entrepreneurship may make nations happier, but as nations become happier, their need and imperative for entrepreneurship seems to decline. Hence, not everybody should become entrepreneurs and the happiness of a nation cannot be –indefinitely increased by increasing the numbers of entrepreneurs.

It is proposed that both perspectives will be necessary for future graduates. Design/Methodology/Approach: The paper highlights the fast changing nature of the economic and employment context and the future requirements for graduate skills. It analyses and evaluates a framework of curricular and extra-curricular activities which has been developed to address future skills needs. The paper uses a case study to illustrate the issues. Findings: The paper concludes that with increasingly flexible career paths {{there is a need for}} graduates to be prepared for portfolio careers in which they move between employment and <b>self-employment.</b> The <b>development</b> of an independent mindset which can identify and exploit innovation is therefore important. Practical Implications: The paper outlines an approach, that has been implemented in a UK higher education institution, to the development of innovation skills which is responsive to a wider range of students than the conventional cohort of young, full-time students.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we address the {{relationship}} between the extent of business ownership (<b>self-employment)</b> and economic <b>development.</b> We will focus upon three issues. First, how is the equilibrium rate of business ownership related to the stage of economic development? Second, what is the speed of convergence towards the equilibrium rate when the rate of business ownership is out-of-equilibrium? Third, to what extent does deviating from the equilibrium rate of business ownership lead to less economic growth? Hypotheses concerning all three issues are formulated setting up a new two-equation model. We find confirmation for the hypothesised effects using a data panel of 23 OECD countries. An important policy implication of our exercises is that low barriers to entry and exit of self-employed/businesses are necessary conditions for the equilibrium seeking mechanisms that are vital for a sound economic development...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{entrepreneurship}} {{has received}} an increased amount {{of interest in}} recent years, with self-employment being used as the most common proxy for “entrepreneurship” in empirical studies. However, there are various ways of defining selfemployment, making it a somewhat dubious proxy. This may flaw the analysis, especially in cross-country studies, since the documentation of data often is insufficient and difficult to access due to language barriers. We present an analysis of Swedish self-employment data. We show that the measurement of self-employment has changed over time to noticeably affect the reported number of self-employed in the two major statistical sources on <b>self-employment.</b> The reported <b>development</b> of <b>self-employment</b> sometimes differs diametrically depending on source. Sweden is occasionally erroneously reported to show the largest increase in selfemployment in cross-country studies.

40|$|Although eastern Croatia, due to {{its natural}} {{resources}} and very good geographic location, used to be industrially highly developed, nowadays {{it is one of}} the least developed regions in the Republic of Croatia. Driven by a war situation, the disappearance of traditional industries (textile industry, furniture, foodprocessing, metal working) contributed to weak development. With market opening and disappearance of labour-intensive industries, the need for change in thinking became obvious, together with education and encouraging of <b>self-employment.</b> Rapid <b>development</b> of ICT in the world on the one hand and the involvement of numerous highly educated and enthusiastic IT experts on the other has increased the development of IT industry in Osijek. This is an industry where market has no limits, entry costs are low and revenues are relatively high.

40|$|We {{examine the}} long-run effects of micro-credit on {{development}} in an occupational choice model similar to Banerjee and Newman (JPE, 1993). Micro-credit is modeled as a pure {{improvement in the}} credit market that opens up self-employment options to some agents who otherwise could only work for wages or subsist. Micro-credit can either raise or lower long-run GDP, since it can lower use of both subsistence and full-scale industrial technologies. It typically lowers long-run inequality and poverty, by making subsistence payoffs less widespread. Thus, an equity-efficiency tradeoff {{may be involved in}} the promotion of micro-credit. However, in a worst case scenario, micro-credit has purely negative long-run effects. The key to micro-credit's long-run effects is found to be the "graduation rate", defined as {{the rate at which the}} self-employed build up enough wealth to start full-scale firms. We distinguish between two avenues for graduation: "winner" graduation (of those who earn above-average returns in self-employment) and "saver" graduation (due to gradual accumulation of average returns in <b>self-employment).</b> Long-run <b>development</b> is not attainable via micro-credit if "winner" graduation is the sole avenue for graduation. In contrast, if the saving rate and self-employment returns of the average micro-borrower are jointly high enough, then micro-credit can bring an economy from stagnation to full development through "saver" graduation. Thus the lasting effects of micro-credit may partially depend on simultaneous facilitation of micro-saving. Eventual graduation of the average borrower, rather than indefinite retention, should be the goal of micro-banks if micro-credit is to be a stepping stone to broad-based development rather than at best an anti-poverty tool. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to consider the application of decision support system (DSS) for e-counselling of the unemployed, specially focusing on <b>self-employment</b> solutions. The <b>development</b> of DSS is tackling main social challenges of the long-term unemployed: it conveys an experience from previous employment; provides new business opportunities, which are highly related to person's hobbies; and it connects people by developing complementary groups of same interests and same positive attitudes towards entrepreneurship. From a technical perspective we suggest that it is advisable to place a workflow engine at the core of the Internet based e-decision making system. This will let us generate and manage personalized and adaptable individual recommendation access. The access flow algorithm of DSS consists of three interconnected blocs: the first bloc is constructed for the self- containment as process logic and analysis of consumer objectives; the second one analyses person's ability for entrepreneurship, it also evaluates individual's overall motivation to start his own business; and the third bloc provides with potential complementary business partners or business start-up...|$|R

It employs a descriptive statistics in the first part and Granger causality Wald tests in the second part. In the first part, 1961 to 2010, the findings indicate that there is an increase in the average growth rates, especially in the six economic sectors, agriculture, mining, trade services construction, transport services and dwellings. However, there is a significant increase in growth elasticity of self-employment in agriculture and trade services. Likewise, an evidence of reduction in absolute poverty ($ 1. 25 per day) from 63 percent in 1990 to 37 percent in 2010 but poverty under $ 2 per day remains high, 72 percent. In the second part, 1992 and 2012, our results show that in the short run, foreign direct investment (FDI) has a direct positive effect on the real GDP, but no evidence that FDI has a direct positive effect on <b>self-employment.</b> In contrast, <b>development</b> assistance (DAC) has no direct effect on the real GDP, but it has a direct positive effect on self-employment.

40|$|Security and {{insecurity}} aspects of home ownership Over {{the last three}} decades there has been a widespread increase in home ownership across Europe, with most countries experiencing increases in real house prices.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the growing aspect of {{entrepreneurship}} associated with lifestyle-induced migration from wealthy countries, through investigating self-employment among expatriates from northern Europe in rural areas of southern France and Spain. Most expatriates had no prior experience of entrepreneurship and typically established their business opportunistically and some time after arrival. Based upon interviews with 41 expatriate households (operating 70 business ventures), the study explores {{the characteristics of the}} individuals involved, the nature of their businesses, factors influencing start-up, and processes and patterns of business <b>development.</b> <b>Self-employment</b> is shown to be the most effective available mechanism for supporting lifestyle objectives of expatriates who vary greatly in their skills, experience and resources. The study identifies significant differences between the respective groups from the two countries, reflecting the spatially differentiated character of migration in terms of age, education, qualifications and capital resources. These appear to have given rise to a more sophisticated profile of businesses in the French areas. Sharp differences in language skills as between the different countries are seen as influencing the ability of entrepreneurs to network with, and market to, the indigenous population, with implications for the future development of the businesses, and their local impact. The study seeks to augment standard conceptual approaches to entrepreneurship, through taking account of the primacy of the migration decision and specific related processes, and proposes a model that advances our understanding of the phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Self-employment rates differ widely across {{industries}} and across {{racial and ethnic}} categories. The former is relatively easy for economists to explain while the latter differences are more difficult. Self-employment is rare in industries for which production is characterized by substantial economies of scale. Self-employment {{is more common in}} services than in manufacturing, although it is greatest in agriculture. There are also substantial differences in self-employment across countries, with the evidence suggesting an inverse relationship between <b>self-employment</b> and economic <b>development.</b> For the United States, self- employment rates tend to be higher in less densely populated states because self-employment rates are greater when average firm size is smaller (Lunn and Steen, 2000). According to some people, differences in self-employment rates across racial and ethnic categories are due to discrimination. Self-employment rates are higher for whites than other racial/ethnic groups, and are higher for men than for women. The numerous programs initiated by state and local governments to assist minority- and women-owned businesses usually offer discrimination against minorities and women as a rationale for the programs. However, self-employment rates often differ widely across more narrowly defined groups within broader racial or ethnic classifications. Within the United States, there is a relatively large gap between self-employment rates of Mexicans and Cubans, and a larger gap between Koreans and Laotians. Fairlie (1996) reports self-employment rates for Russians of 24. 9 percent and 10. 5 percent for Belgians. These differences in self-employment rates within broader classifications (Hispanics, Asians, and Europeans) suggest that discrimination may not be the primary cause. In this paper, we examine self-employment rates among various ethnic groups within the broader classification of Asian to illustrate the heterogeneity of the self-employed, and to discuss the implications of this heterogeneity...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} explore the role of Community Disability Workers (CDWs) in facilitating {{livelihood}} opportunities for disabled youth in rural Southern Botswana. The CDWs in the study worked in Community- based Rehabilitation (CBR) programmes. The elements of the Livelihood component of CBR Guidelines include skills <b>development,</b> <b>self-employment,</b> waged employment, financial assistance and social security. In particular, the study presented the knowledge, skills, practices (activities and methods), and strategies used by CDWs to facilitate access to the livelihood opportunities for disabled youths in rural areas. The literature review explored CBR as a strategy for addressing the needs and demands of people with disabilities. Botswana has implemented a CBR programme which is co-ordinated at the Rehabilitation Division of the Ministry of Health and involves disabled people, health professionals, the community and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). Community health workers coordinate disability activities in rural as well as urban areas and comprise a range of health care practitioners namely physiotherapists, social workers, rehabilitation technicians, rehabilitation officers and health education assistants. In this study, community health workers were referred to as CDWs and only those with tertiary qualifications (certificate, diploma or degree level of training) were used as participants. Methodology: A qualitative research approach using a case study design was adopted. Purposive sampling was used to select seven participants from districts {{in the southern part}} of Botswana to participate in the study. The unit of study were the practices of the CDW in facilitating access to livelihood opportunities for disabled youth. Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews with the CDWs. Interviews were digitally recorded and later transcribed verbatim. Analysis of data involved coding for themes and categories emerging from the data in the context within which it appeared. The environmental chapters of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) were used for data interpretation. Findings: The findings of the study illustrated the role of CDWs in facilitating livelihood opportunities for disabled youth. Five themes that emerged were related to CDWsâ€™ own experience of disability and rural environments, their knowledge and experience in facilitating livelihoods; their practices and strategies; the barriers to participation experienced by disabled youth; and lastly, the CDWsâ€™ suggestions for increasing participation and inclusion of disabled youth in livelihood opportunities. The findings established that CDWs were involved in facilitating access to health facilities and assistive devices as well as education and skills development. Some strategies used were advocacy, networking, information dissemination, role modelling and follow-ups on former students. The barriers identified were inadequate disability policy; absence of disability friendly public facilities and transport; a poorly resourced public education system and inaccessible job markets. Suggestions made by CDWs included having inclusive policies and structures; addressing educational and training needs; accountability regarding employment; and community sensitisation and mobilisation. The Discussion chapter interpreted the findings in terms of current literature and developed two further themes. One addressed the environmental factors impacting on disability and the other one addressed successful strategies to enhance livelihood opportunities in light of these environmental factors. Recommendations included facilitating information on accessibility of assistive devices; minimising barriers to natural and made-made changes to the environment; building a network of supportive relationships; changing attitudes of community as well as government leadership; and facilitating implementation of inclusive services, systems and policies. In Conclusion, CDWs are well placed to facilitate accessibility of livelihood opportunities for disabled youth. However, they need to be empowered with necessary resources such as disability inclusive policies, systems and services, attitudinal changes and revision of their training modules...|$|R
40|$|The South African {{economy is}} {{currently}} characterised by {{high levels of}} unemployment, abject poverty, high illiteracy, low productivity and low international competitiveness. It is also struggling {{to attract and retain}} foreign direct investment and portfolio investments. Amidst this situation, the formal sector is also continuously shedding jobs. Furthermore, the formal sector absorption capacity is steadily declining as is apparent over the past three decades, where formal the absorption capacity declined from approximately 75 per cent to about three per cent currently. Related to this is the fact that although the South African economy is growing, even at the currently low levels, it seems to be one that can be described as 'jobless growth'. Hence, currently unemployed individuals and future job seekers will be more and more dependent on 'creating employment for themselves' than to merely {{be able to find a}} job in the formal sector of the economy. The need thus exists to create a situation where the entrepreneurial flair of individuals must be developed, supported and encouraged. In other words, the need for building capacity to encourage small business development, especially within the previously disadvantaged groups in South Africa, is of paramount importance to the development and long-term survival of the South African economy. Issues such as the absence or limited availability of social safety nets in South Africa, reinforces the dire need for <b>self-employment,</b> growth and <b>development.</b> This will also largely decrease the state of dependency of a large percentage of people, either unemployed or potentially unemployed. Furthermore, the development of entrepreneurial behaviour will lead to the extension of labour market skills and will also combat the possible obsoleteness of current skills due prolonged periods of unemployment. The SME sector is continuously considered as one of the most viable means to create employment and well-being in the South African economy. A business in general, whether micro, small or medium, which produces goods and services that are in demand, will have the over-arching aim of generating income for its owners or operators. It is therefore easy to understand that it is the initiative of a person or persons that leads to the creation of a formal entity and it is the amalgamation of all the individual entities, big or small, that determines the state, nature and direction of a country's economy. South Africa is no different in this scenario. The South African government also realises that SMEs are the logical 'kick-start' mechanism to job creation and future prosperity in the country, therefore the attitude of government has changed significantly towards allowing new opportunities for entrepreneurs. The main concern is that the majority of small businesses do not remain competitive for long enough to pass on the benefits to their respective communities and the economy in general. The main purpose of the paper will be to place the South African regional economy in perspective. Secondly, to provide a better understanding of SME operations in the South Africa regional milieu, especially in ascertaining to what extent an enabling environment is created for SME business entrepreneurs to flourish and prosper. Thirdly, will be the aim to identify where the pit-falls are and which type of constructive support can be developed to assist small business entrepreneurs in their endeavour to set up a formal business and to continue it as a successful going concern. ...|$|R
