5|$|By {{the time}} the {{comparatively}} youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, the Soviet economy was <b>stagnant</b> and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings {{as a result of}} the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s. These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state.|$|E
5|$|One day Al•Ith enters Zone Two {{and does}} not return. But the changes {{set in motion by}} the two marriages are now evident everywhere. The frontiers between Zones Three, Four and Five are open, and people and {{knowledge}} are flowing between them. Previously <b>stagnant,</b> the three Zones are now filled with enquiry, inspiration and renewal.|$|E
5|$|Póvoa de Varzim's {{real estate}} {{development}} ranked as the fifth most active out of seventeen municipalities of Metropolitan Porto in 2015, when considering new homes. Reconstruction was mostly <b>stagnant,</b> and Póvoa de Varzim was eighth in overall activity.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} December 2015, most {{hospitals}} in Chennai had wholly or partially restored services. State health authorities in Tamil Nadu reported post-flooding sanitation efforts had been successful, and that {{there had not been}} any flood-related outbreaks of disease. While floodwaters had largely receded by 19 December, areas of <b>stagnant</b> water covered parts of Tamil Nadu into January 2016, notably around Cuddalore and Tuticorin. Central government survey teams conducted studies on the extent on the flooding in early January.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, {{the city}} re-emerged {{as a major}} tourist {{destination}} centered on casinos and other vice businesses. Featuring venues, such as the famed Balinese Room, the city became nationally known as the sin city of the Gulf. The illegal businesses were finally closed in the 1950s, leading to a long, <b>stagnant</b> economic period. Many businesses relocated off of the island, though some, such as the insurance businesses and the medical school, remained.|$|E
5|$|In New Zealand, {{the song}} debuted at number {{fourteen}} on the New Zealand Singles Chart. It remained <b>stagnant</b> {{the next week}} until it peaked at six on the chart the following week. Having spent thirteen weeks on the chart, the song was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ), for shipments totalling 7,500 copies.|$|E
5|$|Much of the inter-war period saw {{economic}} recession or <b>stagnant</b> growth, making fund-raising more challenging. Partially as a result, many memorial projects {{had to be}} cut back or altered {{due to lack of}} money. The final size of Douaumont had to be cut in size by a third when fund-raising slowed. Proposals to turn the planned Imperial War Museum into a grand memorial for the war dead were shelved due to lack of funds.|$|E
5|$|Operation Bodenplatte (Baseplate), {{launched}} on 1 January 1945, {{was an attempt}} by the Luftwaffe to cripple Allied air forces in the Low Countries during the Second World War. The goal of Bodenplatte was to gain air superiority during the <b>stagnant</b> stage of the Battle of the Bulge so that the German Army and Waffen-SS forces could resume their advance. The operation was planned for 16 December 1944, but was delayed repeatedly due to bad weather until New Year’s Day, the first day that happened to be suitable.|$|E
5|$|The Duck End {{was one of}} {{the poorer}} districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19thcentury it had no sewers or refuse collections. The area had a number of open ditches filled with <b>stagnant</b> water, and {{outbreaks}} of malaria and cholera were common. The cottages had inadequate ventilation and lighting, and no running water. Faeces from the duck ponds permeated the local soil and seeped into the cottages through cracks in the floors.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} in {{development}} for approximately {{three years at}} Paramount Pictures, during which time a screen adaptation that differed significantly from the novel was written. Summit Entertainment acquired {{the rights to the}} novel after three years of the project's <b>stagnant</b> development. Melissa Rosenberg wrote a new adaptation of the novel shortly before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike and sought to be faithful to the novel's storyline. Principal photography took 44 days and completed on May 2, 2008; the film was primarily shot in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{method of}} forecasting the weather, persistence, relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. This {{can be a}} valid way of forecasting the weather when {{it is in a}} steady state, such as during the summer season in the tropics. This method of forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a <b>stagnant</b> weather pattern. Therefore, when in a fluctuating weather pattern, this method of forecasting becomes inaccurate. It can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} {{development}} team and the complexity of porting the whole browser to a new backend caused Epiphany to re-release version 2.22 with bugfixes instead of the actual development code, so browser development remained <b>stagnant</b> until , when the project team announced that Epiphany 2.26 would be the final Gecko-based version. Eventually, in September 2009 the Webkit-powered Epiphany 2.28 was released, as part of GNOME 2.28.|$|E
5|$|Years after independence, West Bengal {{was still}} {{dependent}} on the central government for help in meeting its demands for food; food production remained <b>stagnant,</b> and the Indian green revolution bypassed the state. However, {{there has been a}} significant increase in food production since the 1980s, and the state now has a surplus of grains. The state's share of total industrial output in India was 9.8% in 1980–1981, declining to 5% by 1997–1998. In contrast, the service sector has grown at a rate higher than the national rate.|$|E
5|$|Although {{humanity}} and the Overlords have peaceful relations, some believe human innovation is being suppressed and that culture is becoming <b>stagnant.</b> One {{of these groups}} establishes New Athens, an island colony {{in the middle of}} the Pacific Ocean devoted to the creative arts, which George and Jean Greggson join. The Overlords conceal a special interest in the Greggsons' children, Jeffrey and Jennifer Anne, and intervene to save Jeffrey's life when a tsunami strikes the island. The Overlords have been watching them since the incident with the Ouija board, which revealed the seed of the coming transformation hidden within Jean.|$|E
5|$|Biomass {{for heat}} and {{power is a}} fully mature {{technology}} which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively <b>stagnant</b> over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One {{of the problems of}} biomass is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.|$|E
5|$|Director Harry Morris {{identified}} {{a site for}} a new ground in Bordesley Green, some three-quarters of a mile(1km) from Muntz Street towards the city centre. The site was where a brickworks once operated; the land sloped steeply down to <b>stagnant</b> pools, yet the stadium was constructed in under twelve months from land clearance to opening ceremony on Boxing Day 1906. Heavy snow nearly prevented the opening; volunteers had to clear pitch and terraces before the match, a goalless draw against Middlesbrough, could go ahead. The ground is reputed to have been cursed by gypsies evicted from the site; although gypsies {{are known to have}} camped nearby, there is no contemporary evidence for their eviction by the club.|$|E
5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth. Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. It entails the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity. However, the balanced growth theory involves {{the creation of a}} brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a <b>stagnant,</b> self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Sarawak's {{economy was}} <b>stagnant</b> during {{the rule of}} {{previous}} three white Rajahs. After the formation of Malaysia, Sarawak GDP growth rate has risen due to increase in petroleum output and the rise in global petroleum prices. However, the state economy is less diversified and still heavily dependent upon the export of primary commodities when compared to Malaysia overall. The per capita GDP in Sarawak was lower {{than the national average}} from 1970 to 1990. As of 2016, the urban-rural income gap remained a major problem in Sarawak.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to Chicago's skyscrapers {{began to}} grow during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Even before the {{development}} of the skyscraper, some criticized large buildings in Chicago for dominating churches and private houses, and this sentiment strengthened. Critics complained that the concentration of tall buildings {{in the center of the}} city was causing huge congestion, and each new skyscraper was also burning additional coal to power its facilities, together consuming a total of over one million tons each year, leaving smoke and <b>stagnant</b> air hanging over Chicago. Many were concerned over the risk of a major fire breaking out and spreading, uncontrolled, from building to building.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{construction}} of the Canning Dam, among other drinking water supply dams, water flow into the Canning River has been reduced by up to 96%. A number of freshwater fish species which are endemic to the south-west of Western Australia are found in the Canning River system, however studies of fish and fish habitats in the area have shown that fish numbers are low due to a loss of habitat and a loss of linkage between breeding areas due to low flows, preventing fish migrating upstream and reaching important breeding and nursery grounds. <b>Stagnant</b> water caused by a lack of water flow has provided a suitable habitat for successful breeding of an introduced pest, the mosquitofish.|$|E
5|$|The Jugendstil, {{a variant}} of Art Nouveau, had a certain {{influence}} on {{much of the new}} construction in Norway {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. The city of Ålesund, after burning to the ground in 1904, was rebuilt almost entirely in this style and continues to be a prominent example, along with Riga and Brussels. Trondheim also has numerous art nouveau buildings. In the capital Oslo, few art nouveau buildings were erected, due to a local economic crisis and a <b>stagnant</b> building trade during the first decade of the century. However, some public buildings were constructed in this style, such as the Historical Museum and the Government office building. In Bergen, the main theatre Den Nationale Scene is a monumental example.|$|E
5|$|The aquatic {{habitats}} {{preferred by}} the newts are <b>stagnant,</b> mid- to large-sized, unshaded water bodies with abundant underwater vegetation but without fish, which prey on larvae. Typical examples are larger ponds, which {{need not be}} of natural origin; indeed, most ponds inhabited by the northern crested newt in the UK are human-made. Examples of other suitable secondary habitats are ditches, channels, gravel pit lakes, garden ponds, or (in the Italian crested newt) rice paddies. The Danube crested newt is more adapted to flowing water and often breeds in river margins, oxbow lakes or flooded marshland, where it frequently co-occurs with fish. Other newts {{that can be found}} in syntopy with Triturus species include the smooth, the palmate, the Carpathian, and the alpine newt.|$|E
5|$|The dam catalyzed {{improved}} upstream {{wastewater treatment}} around Chongqing and its suburban areas. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, as of April 2007 more than 50 new plants could treat 1.84million tonnes per day, 65% {{of the total}} need. About 32 landfills were added, which could handle 7,664.5tonnes of solid waste every day. Over onebillion tons of wastewater are released annually into the river, which {{was more likely to}} be swept away before the reservoir was created. This has left the water looking <b>stagnant,</b> polluted and murky.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} policies adopted by Chamorro feminized Nicaragua's labor force. While men's employment rate between 1977 and 1985 remained constant at 68%, women's employment {{outside the home}} in Nicaragua steadily increased {{during the same time}} frame with no reduction in the expectations of simultaneous work within the home. Women's participation in the labor market increased from 26.7% in 1977 to 32% in 1985 and by 1995 was at 36%, one of the highest participation rates in Central America. Though Chamorro's policies changed the nature of the formal work force by introducing more women, the policies did not result in corresponding income increases: wages remained <b>stagnant</b> and changed little over the decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the island entered a long, <b>stagnant</b> period. Many {{businesses}} relocated off of the island. By 1959, the city of Houston had long out-paced Galveston in population and economic growth. Recognizing this, the Reverend Wendelin J. Nold, fifth bishop of the Galveston Diocese, was permitted by the Vatican to erect a Cathedral of convenience in Houston, naming Sacred Heart Church as co-cathedral. The diocese was then re-designated the Diocese of Galveston-Houston. Galveston and St. Mary's Cathedral Basilica still remained {{the home of the}} diocese, but now the bishop could more easily access the rapidly growing Roman Catholic population in Houston.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{designed}} to have a future-retro look, with heavy use of grey tones to give a dreary, <b>stagnant</b> feel to totalitarian London. The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was made {{to feel like a}} cross between a crypt and an undercroft. The Gallery is V's home as well as the place where he stores various artefacts forbidden by the government. Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck, Bacchus and Ariadne by Titian, a Mildred Pierce poster, St. Sebastian by Andrea Mantegna, The Lady of Shalott by John William Waterhouse and statues by Giacometti.|$|E
5|$|The major {{means of}} {{respiration}} in teleosts, {{as in most}} other fish, is the transfer of gases {{over the surface of}} the gills as water is drawn in through the mouth and pumped out through the gills. Apart from the swim bladder, which contains a small amount of air, the body does not have oxygen reserves, and respiration needs to be continuous over the fish's life. Some teleosts exploit habitats where the oxygen availability is low, such as <b>stagnant</b> water or wet mud; they have developed accessory tissues and organs to support gas exchange in these habitats.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Xangsane moved over Thailand on October 2 and combined with monsoonal moisture {{over the north}} {{central part of the}} country, causing torrential rains and severe flooding in over 35 provinces. Floodwaters broke through levees and barriers and flooded or damaged nearly 1.3million rai (2,100km², 520,000acres) of farmland and local infrastructure. Many municipalities reported flooding of up to three meters (10ft), and the municipality of Ang Thong reported flooding of 60cm (2ft). The Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation reported 47 deaths, and villages in several provinces reported significant levels of water pollution and waterborne illnesses from <b>stagnant</b> waters.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the early}} 1980s, the United States had {{relied on the}} {{qualitative}} superiority of its weapons to essentially frighten the Soviets, but the gap had been narrowed. Although the Soviet Union did not accelerate military spending after President Reagan's military buildup, their large military expenses, in combination with collectivized agriculture and inefficient planned manufacturing, were a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, {{which resulted in a}} drop of oil prices in 1985 to one-third of the previous level; oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues. These factors contributed to a <b>stagnant</b> Soviet economy during Gorbachev's tenure.|$|E
5|$|While the {{air cargo}} {{industry}} in Bangladesh grew by 16.5% {{in the fiscal}} year 2003–04, Biman's cargo operations remained <b>stagnant</b> when private operators such as Bismillah Airlines, Best Aviation and Air Bangladesh produced a 108% growth from the previous year. The private operators increased their share of the cargo market by 10.6% and were responsible for handling 24% of the total 99,000tonnes of cargo at the expense of both Biman and foreign airlines which saw a reduction in their shares by 4.6% and 6.0% respectively. Foreign airlines handled 47% of the total cargo with Biman taking on the remaining 29%.|$|E
5|$|A {{combination}} of Federal and State funding was obtained, {{and despite the}} controversy over the number of stops and route, a groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 27, 1972 at Second Avenue and 103rd Street. Construction began shortly thereafter on what was to be the 99th–105th Streets segment, which was projected to cost $17.48 million (worth about $ today). However, the city soon experienced its most dire fiscal crisis yet, due to the <b>stagnant</b> economy of the early 1970s, combined with the massive outflow of city residents to the suburbs, and in September 1975 construction on the line stopped, and the tunnels were sealed. Over the next few decades, the MTA regularly inspected and maintained the tunnel segments (spending $20,000 a year by the early 1990s), to maintain the structural integrity of the streets above, and in case construction would ever resume. Trespassers would often camp in the tunnels until the MTA increased security.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{successful}} debut, 757 sales remained <b>stagnant</b> {{for most of}} the 1980s, a consequence of declining fuel prices and a shift to smaller aircraft in the post-deregulation U.S. market. Although no direct competitor existed, 150-seat narrow-bodies such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 were cheaper to acquire and carried nearly as many passengers as some airlines' 757s. A three-year sales drought abated in November 1983 when Northwest Airlines placed orders for 20 aircraft, which averted a costly production rate decrease. In December 1985, a freighter model, the , was announced following a launch order for 20 aircraft from UPS Airlines, and in February 1986, a freighter-passenger combi model, the , was launched with an order for one aircraft from Royal Nepal Airlines. The freighter model included a main deck cargo hold and entered service with UPS in September 1987. The combi model could carry both cargo and passengers on its main deck and entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in September 1988.|$|E
5|$|Following Nikolai Podgorny's {{removal from}} office, rumours started {{circulating}} within the top circles, {{and on the}} streets, that Kosygin would retire due to bad health. During one of Kosygin's spells on sick leave, Brezhnev appointed Nikolai Tikhonov, a like-minded conservative, to the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers; through this office Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a backup role. For example, at a Central Committee plenum in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, not Kosygin. Following Kosygin's resignation in 1980, Tikhonov, {{at the age of}} 75, was elected the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers. At the end of his life, Kosygin feared the complete failure of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985), believing that the sitting leadership was reluctant to reform the <b>stagnant</b> Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|Historians are {{now turning}} to local gazetteers of Ming China for clues {{that would show}} {{consistent}} growth in population. Using the gazetteers, Brook estimates that the overall population under the Chenghua Emperor (r. 1464–1487) was roughly 75 million, despite mid-Ming census figures hovering around 62 million. While prefectures across the empire in the mid-Ming period were reporting either a drop in or <b>stagnant</b> population size, local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till, so that many would become drifters, conmen, or wood-cutters that contributed to deforestation. The Hongzhi and Zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region, while the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled {{in order to bring}} in more revenues.|$|E
5|$|NY177 {{continues}} winding {{itself to}} the southeast through the town of Rodman, as a rural two-lane highway. After Williams Road, the route makes several bends in {{to the south and}} east, straightening out eastward at an intersection with the northern terminus of CR95. This eastward progression remains <b>stagnant</b> as NY177 continues eastward past CR189. After a short, empty stretch of roadway, NY177 crosses the county line into Lewis County, where it enters the town of Pinckney. Through Pinckney, the route turns to the northeast, crossing Old State Road before bending and turning southeastward into the hamlet of Barnes Corners. In Barnes Corners, the dense forest retreats for a rural community, where NY177 intersects with CR21 and CR2 (Seven-by-Nine Road). CR21 is the former southern terminus of NY194, a designation eliminated in 1980.|$|E
5|$|On October20, the {{government}} of Cuba issued {{an appeal to the}} international community for assistance. The Red Cross provided $1.6million to the country, and various departments of the United Nations provided $80,000. The government of Japan sent about $104,000 worth of medical equipment, and Italy sent about $526,000 worth of medical supplies. The Canadian Red Cross donated a water purification unit, and the Spanish Red Cross sent blankets and cots. The German Red Cross also sent mattresses and blankets. The American Red Cross sent 9.5tons of food. Several other countries sent assistance, including the European Commission which sent $750,000 worth of supplies. There were early difficulties in transporting the relief supplies due to fuel shortages. Due to storm damage, 66,881people resided in shelters until their houses were rebuilt, or until they moved elsewhere. By March 1997, most people had returned to their homes, although some did so without a roof. There was a threat for water-borne diseases due to <b>stagnant</b> waters, although no such outbreaks occurred. The storm decreased the supply of the banana crop in 1997, coupled with a drought.|$|E
