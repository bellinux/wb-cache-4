Structural changes are required for the <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> <b>to</b> function ethically and efficiently in the mental health arena.

Supervision is an essential part of developing into an effective mental health counselor; however, the role of supervision in the development of <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> has been lacking.
