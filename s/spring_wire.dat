2500|$|Owen F. Bieber {{was born}} in December 1929 to Albert F. and Minnie (Schwartz) Bieber in the hamlet of North Dorr, Dorr Township, Michigan. His father was of German {{ethnicity}} and an autoworker at McInerney Spring and Wire Company (an automotive parts supplier) who had co-founded UAW Local 687. It was the first UAW local organized within the city limits of Grand Rapids, Michigan. The family were devout Roman Catholics, and Bieber attended Visitation Elementary School (a two-room school) and Catholic Central High School in nearby Grand Rapids. As a child, he worked pulling weeds in onion and celery fields. He {{graduated from high school}} in 1948, and in July of that year took a job at McInernery Spring and Wire as a wire bender (making seats for Cadillac and Hudson cars). [...] "You had to bend 8- and 9-gauge <b>spring</b> <b>wire,</b> sometimes five wires at a time. Those Hudsons, they had a seat four miles long... It was a hard job. After the first hour in there, I felt like just leaving. If my father hadn't worked there, too, I probably would've", he later said.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{factors like}} poor garage door maintenance, loose tracks, or {{components}} shorten torsion spring life. Owners {{are advised to}} avoid applying grease to garage door tracks because that makes the wheels [...] "skate" [...] in the track instead of turning on their bearings. Only bearings, hinges, and <b>spring</b> <b>wire</b> require lubricant.|$|E
5000|$|Test {{units of}} force {{measurements}} are most commonly newtons or pounds. The peak force {{is the most}} common result in force testing applications. It is used to determine if a part is good or not. Some examples of force measurement: door latch, quality of <b>spring,</b> <b>wire</b> testing, strength ... but more complicated tests can be performed like peeling, friction, texture.|$|E
5000|$|The Yancey Railroad [...] was an American Class III shortline {{railroad}} that operated for {{freight service}} from {{a connection with}} the Clinchfield Railroad at Kona, North Carolina, through Micaville, to Burnsville, 10.6 mi. A short branch ran from Micaville to Bowditch, North Carolina, 2.11 mi. Total mileage was 12.83 miles (20.65 km). Rail was 60-65 pounds and the maximum load limit was 75 tons. Traffic was feldspar, mica, fertilizer, building materials, livestock feed and steel <b>spring</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A <b>wire</b> <b>spring</b> relay {{is a type}} of relay, {{that has}} springs made from drawn wires of nickel silver, rather than cut from flat sheet metal as in the flat-spring relay. This class of relays {{provided}} manufacturing and operating advantages over previous designs. <b>Wire</b> <b>spring</b> relays entered mass production in the early 1950s.|$|R
40|$|The {{reinforcement}} of composite aluminium extrusions offers a high potential regarding weight reduction and improve-ment of mechanical properties, which {{is essential for}} components in lightweight constructions. The current work gives {{an overview of the}} quasi-static properties of <b>spring</b> steel <b>wire</b> reinforced EN AW- 6082 with varying reinforcing ratio. The deformation and damage behaviour is investigated in detail for a reinforcing ratio of 11. 1 vol. %. It is shown that the relatively ductile behaviour of the <b>spring</b> steel <b>wire</b> leads to multiple necking resulting in higher strains than expected. Current models are expanded and modified for a proper adaptation to the material system...|$|R
50|$|In 1883 in Carthage, Missouri, J.P. Leggett {{developed}} {{a new type of}} bedspring consisting of single cone <b>spring</b> <b>wire</b> coils, formed and interlaced, then mounted on a wood slat base. The bedspring could then be used as a base for the then-popular cotton, feather or horsehair mattresses. Needing expertise in manufacturing and production, he recruited his soon-to-be brother-in-law, C.B. Platt, whose father owned and operated Platt Plow Works, into the partnership. Together, they produced the components of their Leggett & Platt bedspring, which was patented in 1885.|$|E
50|$|The later Magicube (or X-Cube) {{retained}} the four-bulb format, and was superficially {{similar to the}} original Flashcube. However, the Magicube did not require electrical power. Each bulb was set off by a plastic pin in the cube mount that released a cocked <b>spring</b> <b>wire</b> within the cube. This wire struck a primer tube {{at the base of}} the bulb, which contained a fulminate, which in turn ignited shredded zirconium foil in the flash. Magicubes could also be fired by inserting a thin object, such as a key or paper clip, into one of the slots in the bottom of the cube.|$|E
50|$|In a read station, {{a set of}} 80 <b>spring</b> <b>wire</b> brushes {{pressed against}} the card, one for each column (the 407 read station, {{constructed}} without brushes, held the card stationary and could read a card multiple times, each time generating the same impulses as would be generated by an 80 <b>spring</b> <b>wire</b> station). When a hole passed under the brush, the brush would make contact with a conductive surface beneath the card that was connected to an electrical power source and an electrical pulse, an impulse in IBM terminology, would be generated. Each brush was connected to an individual hub on the control panel, from which it could be wired to another hub, as needed. The action caused by an impulse on a wire depended on when in the cycle it occurred, a simple form of time division multiplexing. Thus an impulse that occurred during 7-time on a wire connected to the column 26 punch magnet would punch a hole in row 7 of column 26. An impulse on the same wire that occurred at 4-time would punch a 4 in column 26. Impulses timed in this way often came from read brushes that detected holes punched in cards as they passed under the brushes, but such pulses were also emitted by other circuits, such as counter outputs. Zone impulses and digit impulses were both needed for alphanumeric printing. They could both be sent on a single wire, then separated out by relay circuits based on the time within a cycle.|$|E

50|$|A {{battery holder}} {{is either a}} plastic case with {{the shape of the}} housing molded as a {{compartment}} or compartments that accepts a battery or batteries, or a separate plastic holder that is mounted with screws, eyelets, glue, double-sided tape, or other means. Battery holders may have a lid to retain and protect the batteries, or may be sealed to prevent damage to circuitry and components from battery leakage. Coiled <b>spring</b> <b>wire</b> or flat tabs that press against the battery terminals are the two most common methods of making the electrical connection inside a holder. External connections on battery holders are usually made by contacts with pins, surface mount feet, solder lugs, or wire leads.|$|E
50|$|Latch and Batchelor: Founded by Mr Arthur Latch, Mr Telford Clarence Batchelor and Mr Henry Herbert Horsfall {{to develop}} Mr Batchelorâ€™s patent of Locked Coil Wire Rope and Flattened Strand, it {{was formed in}} 1884 on part of the Hay Mills site owned at that time by Webster and Horsfall Ltd. Due to its smooth outer layer Locked Coil became {{increasing}} popular with its use in aerial ropeways and its unexpected yet excellent non-spinning properties and high breaking-strength-to-weight ratio were recognized by the mining industry and adopted worldwide. Locked Coil development continued {{with the advent of}} the half-lock Colliery Guide ropes and more use being made of galvanized wires. The company was one of the first to come under direct Government control in both World Wars. In the 1914-18 war they were the sole manufacturer of shell fuse <b>spring</b> <b>wire,</b> for example, producing 80,260 miles, along with anti-submarine netting, mine, aircraft and balloon cables.|$|E

50|$|A <b>wire</b> <b>spring</b> relay {{typically}} {{has many}} individual contacts. Each contact {{is either a}} fixed contact, which does not move, or is a moving contact, and is made from a short piece of wire. The contact points are made from small blocks of precious metals, such as palladium, which are spot-welded to the <b>wire</b> <b>springs.</b> The majority of the <b>wire</b> <b>spring</b> relays manufactured in the 1960s had twelve fixed contacts. A normally open (make) contact, a normally closed (break) contact, or both can be provided for each fixed contact. A moving contact consists of two wires projecting out of {{the base of the}} relay, bent slightly inwards in order to exert pressure against the armature.|$|R
50|$|Reed relays {{are smaller}} and cheaper, thus {{better suited to}} data storage. They were used in {{conjunction}} with <b>wire</b> <b>spring</b> relays, for example to store digits for sending to other crossbar switching offices. In a multi-frequency sender (the part of a switch which sends routing information about outgoing calls over trunk lines), for example, <b>wire</b> <b>spring</b> relays direct the dialed digits one at a time from reed relay packs to frequency generators, under sequential control of logic implemented with <b>wire</b> <b>spring</b> relays. At the other end, similar relays steered the incoming digits from the tone decoder to a reed relay memory. In such uses two-out-of-five codes and similar schemes checked for errors at both ends.|$|R

40|$|A splint for {{controlled}} active motion after flexor tendon repair is described. It {{incorporates a}} single core-coated elastic band passing around a palmar pulley and attached proximally to a <b>spring</b> <b>wire.</b> Its mechanical properties were tested against six other systems. The tension in various systems all rose near full extension. However, the palmar pulley, the <b>spring</b> <b>wire,</b> and the elastic band each could lower the tension significantly. When the bending moments at the interphalangeal joints were measured, all systems produced a peak {{during the latter}} part of extension. With the palmar pulley, <b>spring</b> <b>wire,</b> and elastic band, the rise was minimal and in fact, the bending moments diminished near full extension. Initial results in 28 flexor tendon repairs using this splint showed less flexion contracture when compared with 78 flexor tendon repairs using a standard rubber band anchored at the wrist. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

30|$|Habitat {{modification}} {{through the}} placement of physical barriers preventing pigeons from perching on buildings and other urban structures are used widely due to their durability and acceptance by the public (Giunchi et al. 2012). Haag-Wackernagel and Geigenfeind (2008) suggest that through the restriction of entrance dimensions and the exaggeration of sloping surfaces, access prevention to ideal roosting and nesting sites can be achieved. Anti-perching devices such as <b>sprung</b> <b>wires</b> (Hutton 2005) and bird spikes (Seamans et al. 2007), or the total exclusion through netting (Hutton and Dobson 1993) {{can be used to}} deter pigeons from making use of buildings in urban environments. Cost may be a limiting factor in their implementation, and the effectiveness of these barriers can depreciate over time if these devices are not maintained (Hutton 2005).|$|R
