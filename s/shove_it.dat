500|$|In early November 2007, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) {{called on}} radio {{listeners}} to contact companies that advertise on Savage's program {{to express their}} concerns about his comments concerning Muslims. Savage {{was quoted as saying}} Muslims [...] "need deportation", and that adherents of Islam would do well to [...] "take your religion and <b>shove</b> <b>it</b> up your behind" [...] because [...] "I'm sick of you." [...] On his show and website, Savage answered by accusing CAIR of supporting Hamas.|$|E

500|$|Lauren has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. Canning praised Fink's {{performance in the}} episode [...] "Silly Love Songs", as well as Lauren's dialog. Lisa Respers France of CNN commented that she is beginning to really like Lauren, noting: [...] "for me Lauren represents how Ryan Murphy is {{able to take the}} concept of the outcast, flip it on its ear and <b>shove</b> <b>it</b> back in our faces with a side order of fabulousness." [...] Reiter felt that in [...] "Comeback", new characters Lauren and Sam [...] "managed to shine".|$|E
500|$|During the {{backwards}} guitar solo, Frusciante {{was filmed}} waving a large aluminum ribbon; Kiedis was initially apprehensive about Sednaoui's {{desire for the}} guitarist to do so, believing he would tell the director [...] "'Fuck you and take that dancing ribbon and <b>shove</b> <b>it</b> up your French ass, buddy' but [...] gladly went off and made love to the air with this dancing ribbon. He would have danced around for hours with that thing." [...] The footage was edited in reverse to complement the solo. While some of the scenes in the video were planned with a storyboard, {{much of it was}} improvised or made up on the spot over the two-day shoot. During a particular scene Kiedis began to move his tongue flamboyantly to dramatically accentuate the lyrics, which Sednaoui believed was extremely beneficial to the exuberant nature of the video. Where the video begins in {{what appears to be the}} daytime, it concludes at dusk with silhouettes of the band members running into the setting sun.|$|E
500|$|Commenting on {{the paucity}} of new material, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution {{suggested}} that the whole production would more accurately be named the Havin’ a Blast Tour. [...] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said that [...] "The strange thing ... is that the 'Working on a Dream' tour no longer seems to be about 'Working on a Dream'" [...] and suggested that the album was unpopular among many fans and as a result, [...] "Springsteen, always the savvy showman, has chosen not to <b>shove</b> <b>it</b> down anyone's throat." [...] Springsteen fans instantly discussed and analyzed setlists as shows happened on the Backstreets.com BTX website, associated with which Twitter and other sources were used to post, {{or in some cases}} crudely broadcast, shows as they happened. [...] E Street bassist Garry Tallent and guitarist Nils Lofgren found themselves amused that fans had complained on the previous Magic Tour of too much new material being played, and were now complaining of too little. [...] Guitarist Steve Van Zandt said that the Working on a Dream songs that were played were [...] "big" [...] songs, so that made up for their lack of number.|$|E

2500|$|At the rally, Tatchell {{argued for}} the [...] "disestablishment of the Church of England {{and the freedom to}} insult the Queen, Prime Minister and Archbishop of Canterbury." [...] Tatchell said that the far-left is [...] "Mired in the immoral morass of {{cultural}} relativism, they no longer endorse Enlightenment values and universal human rights. Their support for free speech is now qualified by so many ifs and buts. When push comes to <b>shove,</b> <b>it</b> is more or less worthless." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 22 May 2006 they {{released}} their fourth studio album, Reservations, with Cohen and Smith producing. Drowned in Sound's Daniel Ross opined {{that the group}} had a [...] "disgustingly brilliant knack {{of being able to}} make one simultaneously envious of their craft and sickened that they don't do more with it ... although rather obvious in their execution and the buttons they press, [...] can construct images of the poor, broken sod we probably all are anyway and chillingly <b>shove</b> <b>it</b> in your face under a blanket of sweetness". The album was supported by another European tour. In January 2007 the album was one of 25 finalists for the Australian Music Prize.|$|E
2500|$|Of the aftermath, Wallace Matthews of Newsday commented, [...] "They {{are very}} slick, these thugs running the Yankees. ... They {{have been trying}} {{to figure out a way}} to whack Torre while making it appear as if Torre whacked himself. What they came up with was {{brilliant}} in its innovation and chilling in its cynicism, but ultimately transparent." [...] Opined Mike Lupica, [...] "It was just the most famous disagreement we are ever likely to see in baseball, the most famous manager telling the people who run the most famous team to take their job and <b>shove</b> <b>it.</b> [...] A manager finally fired the Yankees." [...] Added Joel Sherman, [...] "Torre erred in turning down the Yankees' proposal to stay in the position that has made him rich and famous beyond what he could have dreamed a dozen years ago." [...] He also walks [...] "away from that juice as much as the ownership." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scott Piering's PA {{announcement}} of the KLF's retirement was largely ignored at the time. NME, for example, assured their readers that the tensions and contradictions would continue to [...] "push and spark" [...] the KLF and that more [...] "musical treasure" [...] would be the result, but they noted: [...] " [...] himself nicely skewered on the horns of an almighty dilemma. He has taken over pop music {{and it has been}} a piece of piss to do so. And he hates that. He wants to be separate from a music industry that clasps him ever closer to its bosom. He loves being in the very belly of the beast, yet he wishes he was something that'd cause it to throw up too. He wants not only to bite the hand that feeds but to <b>shove</b> <b>it</b> into an industrial mincer and stomp the resultant pulp into the dirt, yet pop, as long as you continue to make it money, would let you sexually abuse its grandmother. There is, Bill old boy, no sensible way out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having been {{barred from}} {{releasing}} an album since 2007, the duo had had enough. When they were shortlisted for the Oz Artist of the Year Awards {{they chose to}} vent their frustrations on their official Facebook page with a message that said: [...] "Despite our record label not allowing us to release music this year, we are still nominated in the top 50 for 'Oz artist of the year' awards!" [...] They concluded the post with, [...] "HELP US <b>shove</b> <b>it</b> in their faces, and please VOTE at the link below!!" [...] Lisa and Jessica eventually hired a lawyer {{in a bid to}} get out of their contractual obligations with the label and were successful, so by 2013 The Veronicas became an independent act. Releasing a statement which described the struggles experienced with Warner, they said, [...] "After 5 years of being in a ‘Warner Brothers Records Lockdown’, we are officially able to move forward RELEASING and Recording music without our past label dictating our creative journey, or withholding our musical releases + touring." [...] By April 2014, The Veronicas signed with Sony Music and continued working on their record which was re-named The Veronicas.|$|E
2500|$|Rich {{struggled}} throughout 1979 having hits with United Artists and Epic. His singles were moderate hits that year, {{the biggest}} of them on either UA or Epic was a version of [...] "Spanish Eyes", which became a top-20 country hit. Rich appeared as himself in the 1978 Clint Eastwood movie, Every Which Way but Loose, in which he performed the song [...] "I'll Wake You Up When I Get Home". This song hit number three on the charts in 1979 and was the last top-10 single of his career. In 1980, he switched labels again to Elektra Records, and released a number-12 single, [...] "A Man Just Don't Know What a Woman Goes Through" [...] {{in the fall of}} that year. One more top-40 hit followed, the Gary Stewart song [...] "Are We Dreamin' the Same Dream" [...] early in 1981, but Rich decided to remove himself from the spotlight. For over a decade, Rich was silent, living off his investments in semiretirement and only playing occasional concerts. He also played a bit part in the 1981 movie Take This Job and <b>Shove</b> <b>It</b> which yielded his last charted single, [...] "You Made It Beautiful".|$|E

2500|$|Arcade games also {{influenced}} the film industry; beginning with Space Invaders, arcade games began appearing at many movie theaters, while early films based on video games were also produced, most notably Tron, which grossed over $33million in 1982 which began the Tron franchise {{which included a}} video game adaptation that grossed more than the film. Other films based on video games included the 1983 films WarGames (where Matthew Broderick plays Galaga at an arcade), Nightmares, and Joysticks, the 1984 film The Last Starfighter, and the anime [...] in 1986.
