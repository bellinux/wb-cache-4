40|$|The {{sensitive}} {{relationship between}} libraries and the USA PATRIOT Act {{is back at}} the top of the headlines. In August, a “member of the American Library Association”, known only as “John Doe”, filed a federal lawsuit after receiving a National Security Letter (NSL) from the FBI. The NSL requested information from John Doe pursuant to an “authorized investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. ” John Doe is prohibited from discussing the letter or even that they had received the letter John Doe’s lawsuit argues that the provisions of the PATRIOT Act governing NSLs violate the Constitution’s free speech provisions and protections against unreasonable searches. In particular, John Doe argues that the <b>secrecy</b> <b>provision</b> prevents him or her from relating their experiences with the PATRIOT Act as part of the public debate of the Act’s renewal. Most of the concern and debate on the PATRIOT Act’s impact on libraries has focused on Section 215 of the Act. This controversial provision allows government officials to obtain “any tangible things” during an intelligence or terrorism investigation, including library and bookstore records. The Act also requires the recipient of a request to keep it secret. Section 215 is due to expire in December, 2005. However, there are several proposals to extend and modify this section currently being debated in Congress. Section 215 is not unlimited. The law provides that searches which target U. S. citizens cannot be based only on activities protected by the first amendment, such as reading or speech. The law also requires that a subpoena be obtained from a designated federal court judge, who reviews the subpoena request to ensure that it complies with the law. Although this process has been criticized for its secrecy and overwhelming history of approving subpoena requests, there is at least some judicial review...|$|E
40|$|The 2014 Farm Bill {{ushered in}} some {{significant}} and surprising changes. One {{of these was}} that it rendered the identity of all the recipients of farm subsidies secret. Representative Larry Combest, {{who is now a}} lobbyist for agribusiness, first introduced a <b>secrecy</b> <b>provision</b> into the bill in 2000. The provision, however, only applied to subsidies made in the form of crop insurance. Until 2014, the majority of subsidies were direct payments and the identity of the people who received them was public information. In fact, the Environmental Working Group’s release of the list of recipients led to a series of scandals because it featured celebrities Bruce Springsteen and Jimmy Carter, members of the House and Senate, and a considerable number of billionaires, including founders of high-profile companies such as Microsoft and Charles Schwab. The resulting outcry against the corruption represented by these payments increased support for the elimination of direct payments. The Bill consequently replaced these payments with two new crop insurance programs, thereby extinguishing public access to the list of farm subsidy recipients. This move was particularly disturbing in an era where transparency in the food system is commonly viewed as desirable and even necessary. Another dramatic aspect of the Bill was that it cut $ 8 billion from the food stamp program, affecting approximately 1. 7 million people. What it did not do, however, is alter the allocation of agricultural subsidies that has been in place since the Bill’s first incarnation in 1933. This is surprising in light of evolving medical insights into nutrition and shifting national health priorities. This resistance to change suggests that health and nutrition are not driving the Farm Bill. Instead, it appears that large agribusiness has succeeded in capturing the majority of resources allocated to farm support. Although farm subsidies comprise only 14 % of the Farm Bill, they are highly controversial because, not only do they determine which agricultural industries are likely to thrive and survive, they guide the nation’s consumption patterns. The health of farmers and individuals are therefore both at stake in each Farm Bill...|$|E

40|$|This report {{argues that}} section 35 P of the ASIO Act is not justified, {{and that it}} does not contain {{adequate}} safeguards for protecting the rights of outsiders and is not proportionate to the threat of terrorism or the threat to national security. Purpose This report discusses the impact on journalists of the operation of section 35 P of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (ASIO Act) concerning offences for the disclosure of information relating to a special intelligence operation (SIO). Impact The impact of section 35 P on journalists is twofold: A. It creates uncertainty as to what may be published about the activities of ASIO without fear of prosecution. The so-called chilling effect of that uncertainty is exacerbated because it also applies in relation to disclosures made to editors for the purpose of discussion before publication. B. Journalists are prohibited from publishing anywhere at any time any information relating to an SIO, regardless of whether it has any, or any continuing, operational significance and even if it discloses reprehensible conduct by ASIO insiders. Issues The basic problem with section 35 P {{is that it does not}} distinguish between journalists and others (outsiders) and ASIO insiders. The application in this manner of broad secrecy prohibitions to outsiders is not satisfactorily justified, including by precedents in Australia or elsewhere. The SIO scheme is necessary and proportionate to the present threats to security. The statutory and administrative procedures in force are appropriate safeguards against abuse. A <b>secrecy</b> <b>provision</b> relating to the scheme is not inappropriate. However, section 35 P is not justified. It does not contain adequate safeguards for protecting the rights of outsiders and is not proportionate to the threat of terrorism or the threat to national security. Section 35 P is arguably invalid on the basis that it infringes the constitutional protection of freedom of political communication. Section 35 P is also arguably inconsistent with article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and so not in accordance with Australia’s international obligations. Three basic flaws need to be addressed. The first is the absence of an express harm requirement for breach (of the basic offence) by a journalist or other third party. The second is that recklessness is the fault element in relation to the circumstance described in section 35 P(2) (c) (ii) (that is, in relation to the latter harm requirement in the aggravated offence). The third is the prohibition of disclosure of information already in the public domain. Recommendations Section 35 P should be redrafted to treat insiders and outsiders separately, with one part dealing with third parties and another part dealing with insiders. There should be a basic offence (penalty five years imprisonment) and an aggravated offence (penalty 10 years imprisonment) in relation to both insiders and outsiders. Insiders The basic offence and the aggravated offences for insiders would be as per current section 35 P. Outsiders The basic offence for outsiders would have the same elements as section 35 P(1), but with the additional physical element that the disclosure of the information will endanger the health or safety of any person or prejudice the effective conduct of an SIO. Recklessness would be the default fault element in relation to this last physical element. The aggravated offence for outsiders would have the same elements as section 35 P(2) except that the fault element for (c) (ii) should be knowledge rather than recklessness (in other words, the fault element for the circumstance that the disclosure will endanger the health or safety of any person or prejudice the effective conduct of the operation should be specified to be knowledge). There should be a defence of prior publication (not available to a member or ex-member of the intelligence and security services in respect of information available to them in that capacity) ...|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a 15 -month inquiry which {{identified}} 506 <b>secrecy</b> <b>provisions</b> in 176 pieces of Commonwealth legislation, including 358 criminal secrecy offences.

The Final Report makes 61 recommendations for reform and sets out a new and principled framework designed to reinforce open and accountable government while ensuring adequate protection for Commonwealth information that should legitimately be kept confidential.

5000|$|The law {{was passed}} by the Swiss Federal Assembly in 1934 [...] in the {{volatile}} climate of pre-World War II Europe, after Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party established a dictatorship in Germany. Bank <b>secrecy</b> <b>provisions</b> found in Article 47(b) were added before passage of the bill due to Nazi authorities' attempts to investigate the assets of Jews and [...] "enemies of the state" [...] held in Switzerland. Secrecy laws allowed Jews and others to escape from Nazi Germany without losing everything. Having moved assets to Switzerland, Swiss authorities were not allowed to answer German questions about who had what where. Even employees of German banks in Switzerland were not allowed to answer questions from their employer in Germany. The value of this discretion became even greater as the whole of continental Europe was occupied.

The resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem.

To obtain a globally optimal solution of the resource allocation problem, we first transform the resulting non-convex sum-of-ratios objective function into an equivalent objective function in parametric subtractive form, which facilitates the design of a novel iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each iteration, the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation approach is adopted to solve a rank-constrained optimization problem optimally. Numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm can guarantee communication security and provide a significant performance gain in terms of the harvested energy compared to existing designs which are based on the traditional linear EH model.

The public interest is being pulled in opposite directions: the Executive relies on national security considerations to justify confidentiality, whereas Parliament can (and should) demand disclosure in order to hold the Government accountable.

The ALRC has identified and considered 507 <b>secrecy</b> <b>provisions</b> scattered across 175 pieces of legislation, including 358 distinct secrecy offences carrying a wide variety of criminal penalties. This discussion paper indicates the inquiry’s current thinking in the form of specific reform proposals.

In most cases, however, the ALRC proposes that concerns about the protection of Commonwealth information should be addressed through better education and training, improved information handling practices, and public service disciplinary procedures. The proposals contained in DP  74 do not represent the final recommendations of the Inquiry.
