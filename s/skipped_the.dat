5|$|Due to {{the number}} of GPUs in the system, its initial boot was unsuccessful. This was because its {{motherboard}} uses a 32 bit BIOS, which only had approximately 3 GB of address space for the video cards. However, Asus managed to provide them a specialized BIOS that entirely <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> address space allocation of the GTX 295 video cards. The BIOS-replacement coreboot was not tested.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{attended}} Adams School in Derry, {{where his}} academic performance impressed his teachers; he <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> sixth grade, {{and proceeded to}} middle school at Oak Street School in Derry, where he <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> eighth grade. In 1936, {{he went to the}} Pinkerton Academy, a private school in Derry that his father had attended, and where his grandfather had been a trustee. He completed years 9 to 12 there. Fascinated by flight, he created a model airplane club at the Academy, and his Christmas present in 1938 was a flight in a Douglas DC-3. The following year he began cycling to Manchester Airfield, where he would do odd jobs in exchange for the occasional ride in an airplane or informal flying lesson.|$|E

Brown {{had been under}} intense pressure from human rights campaigners {{to send a message}} to China, concerning the 2008 Tibetan unrest. His decision not to attend the {{opening ceremony}} was not an act of protest, but rather was made several weeks in advance and not intended as a stand on principle.|$|E

Lindeman would be signed during the day, while Maurice Jones would be released.|$|E
5|$|American Pharoah's {{connections}} {{drew the}} number five post {{position for the}} Belmont on June 3. Pundits immediately noted {{it was the same}} slot from which Seattle Slew had won the 1977 Belmont and the Triple Crown, and that 14 other Belmont winners had started from the position. American Pharoah was the 3–5 morning line favorite in an eight-horse field that included Tale of Verve, as well as five rivals from the Kentucky Derby who had <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> Preakness, and one horse, Madefromlucky, who had not run either of the previous Triple Crown races, but, like Tonalist the year prior, had instead won the Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont Park. American Pharoah had previously defeated every horse entered, but he was also the only horse to contest all three legs of the Triple Crown and had run four races in the preceding eight weeks.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, O'Brien <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> Australian Championships {{because he}} had no {{sponsorship}} and ran out of money, forcing him to seek full-time work. In 1968, despite Graham Edwards winning the National 200m breaststroke title, the Australian Swimming Union persuaded an overweight O'Brien to make a comeback in 1968 on the grounds that Australia did not have a quality breaststroker for the Olympics. Undergoing a crash diet and fitness program, O'Brien lost 12.7kg in twelve weeks of intense training. O'Brien was unable to reclaim either of his individual Australian titles, but New South Wales again won the medley relay. Nevertheless, he was selected for his second Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Interviews with random {{pilots in}} Widerøe {{showed that the}} airline had {{shortcomings}} in its training procedures, {{in part because it}} lacked a Dash 7 simulator. There was a culture in the airline to divert from cockpit procedures and cooperation. The flight plans often made procedures for mutual control of procedures impractical, and they were commonly <b>skipped.</b> <b>The</b> commission was of the impression that Widerøe's transition from an all-Twin Otter airline to also operate the more demanding Dash 7 was not properly carried out, which had resulted shortcomings in the training and operating procedures. All checklists during the flight were followed correctly. However, the pilots did not elect a method of double-control of the descent and approach, such as by using briefings and callouts.|$|E
5|$|Murray <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> World Group 1st round tie against Argentina, over fears {{he could}} {{exacerbate}} a knee injury, leaving the British {{team in a}} hopeless situation – they lost 4–1. Jamie was furious that Andy was letting them down and the Murrays would not {{speak to each other}} for two weeks. Seven months later, as the brothers prepared for the tie against Austria, Andy declared that he had healed the rift with Jamie. When Jamie Murray and Ross Hutchins were beaten in the doubles, John Lloyd suffered criticism for not playing Andy. Great Britain lost their World Group play-off to Austria 3–2 and were relegated to Europe/Africa Zone Group I.|$|E

In his last-32 match with Mark King at the UK Championship, O'Sullivan sat with a wet towel draped over his head {{for most of the}} contest, and lost 8–9. He then {{successfully}} defended his Premier League title. Having finished first in the league stage, he defeated Steve Davis 5–3 in the semi-finals, and Stephen Hendry 6–0 in the final. O'Sullivan then reached the final of the Masters, but lost 9–10 against Higgins. O'Sullivan <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> Malta Cup, and then lost his opening matches at the next two ranking events, as he lost 1–5 against Ian McCulloch at the Welsh Open and 0–5 against James Wattana at the China Open.|$|E
5|$|Raina {{was named}} captain and Kohli vice-captain for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe in May–June 2010, as many first-choice players <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> tour.

During the series, Kohli became the fastest Indian batsman to reach 1,000 runs in ODI cricket. He made his T20I debut against Zimbabwe at Harare and scored an unbeaten 26. Later that month, Kohli batted at 3 in a full-strength Indian team throughout the 2010 Asia Cup and scored a total of 67 runs {{at an average of}} 16.75. His struggles with form continued in the tri-series against Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Sri Lanka where he averaged 15.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} {{event of the}} 2016/17 season in Ruka, Finland, Prevc, who was leading after the first series, fell upon landing in the second series and {{finished}} third. His brother Domen scored his first World Cup victory at that occasion. Throughout December, Prevc was struggling with his jumps, fell again upon landing at the first event in Engelberg and did not reach the final round at the second event. After the Four Hill Tournament, where he finished 14th, Prevc <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> events in Wisla. Following the break, his results started to improve again. Prevc was the best individual of the team event in Zakopane, where Slovenian team finished third. The team event in Willingen saw, for the first time, all three Prevc brothers representing Slovenia, together with Tepeš; they finished fourth.

5|$|In 1811, Luís Alves {{moved with}} his parents from his grandparents' farm to Rio de Janeiro and was {{enrolled}} at the Seminário São Joaquim (Saint Joachim School), which became PedroII School in 1837. On 4 May 1818, he was admitted into the Royal Military Academy. The entire course (which ran from the first to seventh year) was mandatory for artillerymen and engineers but infantrymen were only required to take first- and fifth-year classes. Luís Alves took the first- and fifth-year classes in 1818 and 1819, respectively. Though he could have <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> other years, he chose to take second-year classes in 1820 and third-year classes in 1821. The subjects he studied in the Royal Military Academy ranged from arithmetic, algebra and geometry to tactics, strategy, camping, fortification in campaign and terrain reconnaissance. He was promoted to alferes (equivalent to a modern-day second lieutenant) on 12 October 1818, and to lieutenant (modern-day first lieutenant) on 4 November 1820.|$|E
5|$|In the EuroBasket 2007, {{in which}} the top three teams {{automatically}} qualified for the 2008 Olympics, Nowitzki led Germany to a fifth place. He was the leading scorer with 24.0 points per game. The fifth place meant that Germany fell short of direct qualification, but was allowed {{to participate in the}} 2008 Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Nowitzki led Germany into a decisive match against Puerto Rico for the last remaining slot. In that crucial match, he scored a game-high 32 points and was vital for the 96–82 win which sent the German basketball team to their first Olympics since the 1992 Summer Olympics. Nowitzki was chosen to be the flag bearer for the German Olympic Team at the Opening Ceremony for the 2008 Olympics. Nowitzki led the German team to a tenth-place finish, and averaged 17.0 points, and 7.6 rebounds for the tournament. In 2009, Nowitzki <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> EuroBasket 2009. In July 2010, he said that he would skip the 2010 FIBA World Championship.|$|E
5|$|With the German {{declaration}} of war in August 1914, all further training at the naval academy was terminated and the normal compulsory officer examination was <b>skipped.</b> <b>The</b> entire Crew 1913 was assigned to various units in the Imperial Navy. Lindemann was assigned to , a battleship which belonged to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet {{under the command of}} Vizeadmiral (vice admiral) Reinhard Scheer, taking on the position of 3rd wireless telegraphy officer. Lothringen was mostly tasked with patrolling the North Sea, sailing back and forth between Altenbruch (now part of Cuxhaven) and Brunsbüttel without engaging in combat. Lindemann left Lothringen on 1 June 1915 to attend the wireless telegraphy school at Mürwik. He successfully completed the course and returned from it in July 1915. He then took over the position of 2nd wireless telegraphy officer and was promoted to Leutnant zur See (Second Lieutenant) on 18 September 1915.|$|E

5|$|Asunción Ocasio Rodríguez {{represented}} Puerto Rico in taekwondo at the Beijing Olympics, and was {{the only}} female athlete from Puerto Rico that Games to represent the commonwealth in the sport. Born in June 1987, Ocasio participated in the Beijing Olympics at age 21 in the welterweight division, which includes athletes under 67kilograms in weight. During the qualification round of the event, Ocasio faced Greek athlete Elisavet Mystakidou. Both athletes scored one point on the other, but Ocasio defeated Mystakidou and advanced to the next round. Ocasio received a bye and <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> first round's repechage round. During the quarterfinal round, Ocasio again participated in the first match, this time facing German athlete Helena Fromm.

5|$|That same offseason, Trevor Hoffman {{retired as}} the all-time regular season saves leader {{with a final}} tally of 601, leaving Rivera as the active leader in saves and 42 behind Hoffman's record to start 2011. Rivera's season was marked by several milestones. He broke the all-time record for games finished, and in May, he became the 15th pitcher to make 1,000appearances {{and the first to}} do so with a single team. He was named an All-Star for the 12th time with a 1.85ERA and 22saves in 26opportunities at the midseason break, but for the second {{consecutive}} year, he <b>skipped</b> <b>the</b> game to rest injuries. His pursuit of Hoffman's saves record reached a climax in the final month of the season; on September13, he collected his 600th save, making him just the second pitcher to accomplish the feat. Four days later, he saved his 601st game, tying him with Hoffman for the most in MLB history. Rivera broke the record on September19 at Yankee Stadium by closing out a 6–4 win against the Twins, the final out by strikeout. After the game, Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli called him to offer his congratulations. Rivera finished the season with a 1.91ERA, a 0.90WHIP, and 44saves in 49opportunities, making him the first pitcher over the age of 40 to save at least 40games in a season.
