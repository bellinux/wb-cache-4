50|$|The family {{relocated}} to Riverside, California in 1910. Smith graduated as valedictorian {{of his class}} from the Peacock Military Academy in San Antonio. When the United States joined the Allies in World War I, Smith enlisted and was commissioned a lieutenant in the Air <b>Service,</b> <b>Signal</b> Corps of America, the first Air Force of the United States. He trained at March Field in Riverside along with another cadet, James Doolittle, who would gain fame for his raid on Tokyo during World War II. Smith graduated first in his class and was retained as an instructor {{during the rest of}} the war. He retired from active military duty as a Major in the Army Reserve. He then founded the Long Beach Meat Packing Company and became the concessionaire for over 70 Safeway grocery stores in Southern California. Safeway abruptly cancelled his contracts, nearly ruining him financially. During that time, he moved to Compton, one of the first suburbs of Los Angeles, which was founded in 1880. In Compton, he founded the Compton Airport and earned extra money as a barnstormer. Taking what money he could scrape together, he began what later became one of the largest supermarket chains in Southern California—Smith's Markets. He is credited as one of the first to create large, self-service supermarkets with lower prices and Sunday openings. That led him into severe price wars with the other major chains of the era—Von's, Ralphs and Thiftimart. He made a practice of locating his large markets near the much smaller and more expensive Safeways, effectively driving them out of much of Southern California for decades.|$|E
