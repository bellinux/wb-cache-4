5000|$|The I-V curve {{shown in}} Fig. 1b shows steps {{covering}} the {{range from about}} -1 mV to +1 mV and is for a junction driven by a nearly optimum level of microwave current. At lower microwave current the steps cover a smaller range of voltage and at higher microwave current the steps become smaller and begin to move off the zero current axis. In a large array, every junction must generate a large zero crossing step and thus the microwave power must be adjusted to a value low enough to accommodate the one junction receiving the largest microwave drive. Thus, {{in order to obtain}} the largest voltage from the smallest number of junctions, an array standard requires a circuit design that can deliver nearly uniform microwave power to many thousands of junctions, all of which are connected in series. The solution to this problem is a simple extension of Fig. 3 to a series of junctions in a line over a ground plane as shown in Fig. 5a. This results in a microwave stripline that can propagate microwave power with relatively low loss.The capacitive impedance of the junctions is so small (approximately 1 m Ω [...] ) relative to the <b>strip</b> <b>line</b> impedance (approx. 3 Ω) that each junction has a very minor effect on the propagation of microwave power in the <b>strip</b> <b>line.</b> Typically, each junction will absorb about 0.02% to 0.04% of the power propagating through it. It is thus possible to connect several thousand junctions in series and still achieve a power uniformity of about ±1.5 dB. With careful design, striplines with as many as 4800 junctions have been used.|$|E

5000|$|A typical {{integrated}} circuit layout for {{an array of}} 20 208 junctions is shown in Fig. 6. The microwave drive power is collected from a waveguide by a finline antenna, split 16 ways, and injected into 16 junction strip lines of 1263 junctions each. The junction striplines are separated from a superconductive ground plane by about 2 micrometers of SiO2 dielectric. Symmetry in the splitting network ensures that the same power is delivered to each subarray. Several precautions are required to avoid reflections {{that would lead to}} standing waves and the consequent nonuniform power distribution within the subarrays: (1) Each stripline is terminated by a matched load that consists of several wavelengths of resistive <b>strip</b> <b>line.</b> The use of resistive stripline rather than a discrete resistor guarantees a near perfect match over a wide range of fabrication parameters. The dimensions of capacitors in the low- and high-pass filters are chosen to avoid resonances near the drive frequency. (3) The microwave bend radius has a minimum value of three times the stripline width. Sharper bends result in unacceptable reflections. In order to meet the bend requirement while still packing the array strips close together, [...] "curly" [...] bends that turn 215° and then back 45° are used. (4) The junction spacing along the line must be close enough to avoid a resonance between adjacent junctions. Microwave power is applied by inserting the finline end of the chip into a slot parallel to the E-field in a WR-12 waveguide. The dc output appears across superconducting pads {{at the edge of the}} chip.|$|E

40|$|In this article, a very crucial {{subject is}} discussed, {{which is the}} three ports active {{circulator}} transmission lines delayed in time stability analysis. Our circuit is a reflection type phase shifter (RTPS), employing a circulator. Micro <b>strip</b> transmission <b>lines</b> have three ports active circulator, with stability analysis under time delayed. Many radio frequency (RF) systems use active circulator as a passive non-reciprocal three- or four-port device, in which microwave or radio frequency power entering any port is transmitted to the next port in rotation (only). Micro <b>strip</b> transmission <b>lines</b> feed those active circulator ports and face a delay parasitic effect of transferring signals in time. These circulator's micro <b>strip</b> transmission <b>lines</b> delays cause the system to instability. Due to parasitic effects of active circulator's micro <b>strip</b> transmission <b>lines,</b> there is delay in time for input/output RF signals which result in system instability. We define active circulator's micro <b>strip</b> transmission <b>lines</b> delays τ 1 for the first port current and τ 3 for the third port current. Accordingly, active circulator's micro <b>strip</b> transmission <b>lines</b> delays Δ 1 for the first port current derivative and Δ 3 for the third port current derivative. We have four delays in time τ 1, τ 2, Δ 1, Δ 3 and discuss sub case where separately delays are equal to zero (τ 1 =τ 2 =τ and Δ 1 =Δ 3 = 0) which describe most of active circulator parasitic effects. The three active circulator ports delayed in time equivalent circuit with micro strip segments can be represented as a delayed differential equation which depends on variable parameters and delays. The investigation of our active circulator element with micro <b>strip</b> <b>lines</b> system differential equation is based on stability switching.

This design is tunable over the efficiency- bandwidth curve and is thus quite versatile in many optical modulation applications. In recent years research on electro-optic modulators has strongly emphasized the development of integrated-optic devices because of their apparent potential for greater per-formance and suitability to fiber optic systems. ' For some applications, however, bulk devices may be more suitable because of lower optical insertion loss and simpler and more developed technologies required to fabricate such devices.
