He dismissed Yeltsin and the key ministers Pavel Grachev (defense), Nikolay Golushko (security), and Viktor Yerin (interior). Russia now had two presidents and two ministers of defense, security, and interior. It was dual power in earnest.

500|$|Ideas {{concerning}} {{the origin and}} fate of the world date from the earliest known writings; however, for almost all of that time, there was no attempt to link such theories {{to the existence of}} a [...] "Solar System", simply because it was not generally thought that the Solar System, in the sense we now understand it, existed. The first <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> theory of Solar System formation and evolution was the general acceptance of heliocentrism, which placed the Sun at the centre of the system and the Earth in orbit around it. This concept had developed for millennia (Aristarchus of Samos had suggested it as early as 250 BC), but was not widely accepted {{until the end of the}} 17th century.

[...] On August25, Governor Abercrombie formally requested for federal assistance, after the state depleted its disaster fund, but that was rejected by FEMA due to insufficient damage. However, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack declared an agriculture disaster, prompting the Small Business Administration to allow federal disaster loans to small businesses. The FEMA decision was reversed on September12, when the federal government approved aid for rebuilding public buildings, as well as future disaster mitigation.|$|E

Donald Kraybill and two other scholars of Amish life noted that [...] "letting go of grudges" [...] is a deeply rooted value in Amish culture, which remembers forgiving martyrs including Dirk Willems and Jesus himself.

2500|$|The USAF Air Materiel Command {{reactivated}} the JB-2 as Project EO-727-12 on 23 April 1948, at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, {{the former}} Alamogordo Army Air Field. The JB-2 {{was used for}} development of missile guidance control and seeker systems, testing of telemetering and optical tracking facilities, and as a target for new surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles (fulfilling the V1's covername, Flakzielgerät— anti-aircraft target device). The JB-2 project used the North American Aviation NATIV (North American Test Instrument Vehicle) Blockhouse and two launch ramps at Holloman: a , two-rail ramp on a 3° earth-filled slope, and a [...] trailer ramp. The trailer ramp was the first <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> system which would eventually be adapted for the forthcoming Martin MGM-1 Matador, the first operational surface-to-surface cruise missile built by the United States.

2500|$|In {{his opening}} {{address at the}} congress, Bolikango said that while [...] "parties based on ethnic foundations" [...] made the first <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> unified Congo, the [...] "national interest" [...] of the country rested upon a [...] "unity of will". He {{enumerated}} that this [...] "does not mean that each ethnic group must abandon its own characteristics, but that through these differences one must endeavour to form a harmonious ensemble." [...] The UNIMO leadership was skeptical of Bolikango's unified outlook for the Congo and remained independent. However, he did secure {{the support of the}} Ngombe, some of the Ngwaka and Bangala, and chiefs from the Lisala, Bongandanga, and Bumba regions. The FUB made an alliance with ASSORECO and FEDUNEC, transforming into the Parti de l'Unité Nationale (PUNA). In spite of its attempts to garner more national appeal, the new party retained its regional bias and failed to amass substantial outside support, costing Bolikango much of his backing in Léopoldville. Still, this reformed political base allowed him to win a position as a national deputy from the Mongala district in the May 1960 national election by 15,000 votes. He attempted to win the office of Équateur provincial president, but was defeated. In the campaign the opposing faction of Laurent Eketebi allied itself with the Budja tribal minority in the provincial assembly, destroying the concept of a unified Bangala tribe that Bolikango had used to elevate his social and political standing. Meanwhile, the radical Mouvement National Congolais (MNC) sharply criticised his connections with the Belgians, undermining his reputation in both Équateur and the capital.|$|E
