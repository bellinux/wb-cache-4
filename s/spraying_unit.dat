Highly skilled labors {{and a number of}} adjustable knobs are required to produce the high quality coating works using the conventional au-tomatic spray gun which is cost intensive. Therefore, linear motor operated multiple spray operations spray gun has been developed. This spray gun consists of two <b>spray</b> <b>units,</b> an air control and supply unit and a triggering unit to carry out the multiple spray operations. This paper focuses on the design optimization and fabrication of the housing of the <b>spray</b> <b>units</b> which hold fluid nozzles, air nozzles, an assembly cap, a needle valve or a ball valve. In the air less and air assisted airless spray systems, high pressurized liquid is passed through the nozzle which is held by the housing of the <b>spray</b> <b>unit.</b> Before entering into the nozzle, the high pressurized liquid is passed through the housing. For the simplicity of the analysis, it is assumed that the housing is an open-ended pressure vessel. From the analysis, dimensions and material selection have been optimized and finally the <b>spray</b> <b>units</b> have been fabricated and tested. During the performance test it is seen that satisfactory transfer efficiency of spray operation has been achieved by using newly developed spray housing of the <b>spray</b> <b>units,</b> which proves the stability of the spray housing during high pressure operation...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A powder spray arrangement has a powder channel (4) for transporting a powder gas mixture, which opens out into a nozzle opening for distributing the powder-gas mixture {{in the form of a}} cloud. The channel has a triboelectric active surface which allows the powder to be charged up with a primary polarity. A corona electrode (3) is located before or after the active surface, so a secondary polarity can be produced. The powder channel is in the form of a ring gap or channel and at least one corona electrode is located behind the nozzle opening. A distribution member is located behind the nozzle opening and the corona electrode voltage can be controlled. The triboelectric material is e. g. polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (which produces a positive charge) or polyamide (which produces a negative charge).

40|$|Soils and sediments are {{conventionally}} {{treated by}} washing processes. Water and energy {{as well as}} tensides and additives are used to separate contaminants from the raw material. Regarding technical and economical aspects the separation is possible for sands containing small amounts of silt. Silt fractions remain as a highly contaminated rest which has to be stored on a waste disposal site. The main characteristics of the new process patented by G. Kupczik are: - a pump system which treats the suspension by high energy impact under partly cavitating conditions and - a special spraying process in the following separation step. Completion of an existing plant (ASRA "t"r"a"d"e"m"a"r"k) by a special spraying and sedimentation unit (DEMI-process) led to very enthusiastic results regarding the degree of separation between organic and mineral particles. Thus additional mineral fractions may be gathered for industrial use. The operational background of the process is investigated in a separate pilot plant at GKSS.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to create a calibration model based on near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy data obtained during a small-scale coating process to predict in-line the coating layer thickness of tablets coated in a side-vented drum coater. The developed setup for the small-scale coating process consisted of a rotating plate with 20 tablets molds that pass a <b>spraying</b> <b>unit,</b> a heating unit, and an in-line NIR spectroscopy probe during one rotation. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) was compressed to flat-faced tablets, and these were coated with a sustained release coating suspension containing Kollicoat IR and Kollicoat SR 30 D. The film thickness of these tablets was determined for each tablet individually with a digital micrometer. A calibration model of predicted film thickness versus real-film thickness using PLS regression was developed. This model was tested against in-line NIR data obtained from a coating drum process, in which biconvex HDPE tablets were film-coated with the same film-coating suspension. The model predicted a final coating thickness of 240 μm, while the measured average thickness (n = 100 tablets) was 210 μm. Taking into account the use of a different setup and differently shaped tablets, it was possible to predict the coating thickness with accuracy comparable to the one of the digital micrometer. Thus, the small-scale rotating plate system was found to be an efficient means of preparing calibration model for a tablet-coating drum process...|$|E

A low-pressure cold-gas dynamic <b>spraying</b> <b>unit</b> was used to generate a jet of hot compressed nitrogen that impinged upon 02 at substrates. Computer codes based on a 01 nite differences method were used to solve a simpli 01 ed 2 D temperature distribution equation for the substrate to produce nondimensional relationships between the surface temperature and the radius of the impinging 02 uid jet, the axial velocity of the cold spray nozzle, the substrate thickness, and the heating time. It was found that a single pro 01 le of the transient nondimensional maximum surface temperature {{could be used to}} estimate the dimensional maximum surface temperature, regardless {{of the value of the}} compressed gas temperature. It was found further that, as the thermal conductance of the substrate increased, the maximum surface temperature of the substrate beneath the gas jet decreased. Heat exchange between the substrate and the compressed gas jet during motion of the nozzle to produce heat conduction within the substrate was characterized by the nondimensional Pecle 4 t number. It was found that lower Pecle 4 t numbers produced higher temperatures within the substrate. The close agreement of the numerical results with the experimental results suggests that the nondimensionalized results may be applied to a wide range of conditions and materials.

40|$|Application of SCR {{catalyst}} {{technology in}} a light-duty Diesel exhaust system requires injection of a reductant. Aqueous urea is injected with a <b>spray</b> <b>unit</b> {{directly into the}} exhaust upstream of an SCR catalyst. Ideally, the aqueous urea droplets must first evaporate and break down to ammonia and HCNO before reaching the catalyst. Multiple chemical reactions then occur on the catalyst reducing NOx. Droplet size is thus critical in this process. Laser PDPA measurements {{have been made in}} the laboratory of the diameter of water droplets from a commercially available urea <b>spray</b> <b>unit</b> in hot air flow to characterize the spray. These measurements have shown significant numbers of droplets with diameters greater than 120 microns. Measurements have also been made with a typical mixer unit downstream of the <b>spray</b> <b>unit</b> and the effect of this on the droplet size distribution is reported. A simple model of the warm up and evaporation of an aqueous urea droplet convecting in a Diesel exhaust has been developed. This can be run as a single droplet simulation programme but could be incorporated into a full CFD model. The latter is required for designing SCR injection systems without recourse to testing. The model is valid for the early part of the evaporation process where it is assumed that water leaves the aqueous urea droplet and also for the later stage where the urea leaves the droplet prior to breaking down by thermolysis. The model has been tested against data available in the literature. The effect of initial droplet size, droplet injection temperature and velocity, and of the exhaust temperature, vapour pressure and flow rate under typical operating conditions are demonstrated. The implications of the model are that the urea droplets must be very small, less than 50 microns, if they are to evaporate in the short distance between the injector and the catalyst in a typical light duty Diesel exhaust system...|$|R

The unit is able to spray uniformly onto any given surface, providing 'mist like' coverage. The high liquid pressure fine spray swirl atomiser that has been developed incorporates a spill-return orifice into the rear face of the swirl chamber with the aim of giving a significant reduction in flow rate whilst maintaining droplet size. Initial work modified a commercial atomiser to add spill-return. However drop sizes were considered to be too large and a new design was constructed based upon earlier work on efficient high pressure (up to 12 MPa) swirl atomisation. The atomiser was characterised for different geometries, supply pressures and spill return orifice sizes using a Laser Particle Sizer (Malvern Mastersizer-X) and Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA). Spill-Return Swirl Atomiser (SRA) with a long swirl chamber was also designed and experimentally tested. This was found to have a direct reflection on the control of spray characteristics and the determination of the coating performance of the SRA on various surfaces in achieving the desired efficiency in the disinfection procedure. The subsequent coating and coverage produced by the SRA was analysed both quantatively and qualitatively via a range of test procedures. The investigation has found that the utilisation of fine sprays (15 um<D 32 < 25 um) at high liquid pressure (< 12 MPa) and low flow rates (< 0. 3 1 /min) is indeed suitable for surface disinfection in healthcare applications (i. e.
