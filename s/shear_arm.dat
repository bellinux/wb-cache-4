40|$|The Strut and Tie Model (STM) {{has been}} used as an {{emerging}} analysis tool for the design of disturbed regions and non- flexural members in concrete structures, where ordinary flexural theory cannot be adopted. Double-corbels are typical non-flexural members and the <b>shear</b> <b>arm</b> length to depth ratio at the critical section is often less than 1. STM has been mostly used for the design of normal strength concrete double-corbel.

40|$|The shear {{strength}} and the fracture behavior of self-compacting reinforced concrete (RC) beams were investigated. Beams with and without shear reinforcement (stirrups) made with self-consolidating as well as normal vibrated concrete (both ordinary and high-performance) were tested in four-point bending considering four <b>shear</b> <b>arm</b> ratios (a – shear span/d – distance from extreme compression fiber to centroid of tension reinforcement = 1. 5, 2. 5, 3. 5, 4. 5). The response of RC beams was assessed {{based on the results}} of crack patterns, load at first cracking, ultimate shear capacity, and failure modes. Comparisons with similar tests on normal vibrated concrete beams show that self-compacting concrete beams exhibit similar {{shear strength}} associated with a more brittle behavior. Finally, the code-based shear resistance predictions for RC beams are considered. While Eurocode 2 predictions exhibit, in terms of shear strength, a lower bound of the experimental results, the crack spacing is not accurately predicted by code specification...|$|E

40|$|The use of tubular {{columns in}} {{conjunction}} with reinforced concrete flat slabs provides structurally efficient solutions which avoid undesirable failure modes such as those associated with shear. This thesis {{is concerned with the}} development of a tubular column-to- flat slab connection system that enables reliable performance under seismic loading conditions. During this research a novel detail which features a gap around the column is proposed and developed; hence only the structural steel shearhead establishes the connection. The exposed parts of the <b>shear</b> <b>arms</b> (fuses) are designed to yield prior to punching shear failure, in a way that utilises the favourable features of steel in terms of the response to seismically induced loads. The proposed connection could serve as a primary lateral resisting system within all building configurations in regions of low to moderate seismicity or as a secondary system in areas of signi cant seismicity. In order to provide validation for the proposed details as well as associated numerical and design procedures, a purpose-built rig which is suitable for large scale testing of structural sub assemblages under combined gravity and uniaxial lateral loading, has been designed and constructed, and subsequently employed for a number of tests. Test results and numerical analyses are presented with respect to a conventional con guration, {{as well as for the}} proposed, partially embedded connection. The latter is shown to offer enhanced ductility compared with traditional forms. The results are used to demonstrate the favourable inelastic performance of the proposed detail in terms of ductility, low degradation effects and increased energy dissipation capabilities. Complementary small scale slab panel tests are also used to further optimise the composite behaviour of the proposed detail. Additionally, a closed form solution based on plastic limit analysis which can serve as a basis for a simplified design approach is proposed. Finally, the main findings from the experimental and analytical investigations are highlighted, and recommendations for future research are outlined.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the service life of gears and bearings inside the ranging arm, and increase {{the reliability of the}} shearer, the hydraulic system of the gear pump was installed for forced lubrication and cooling.

In the gear oil tank, N 320 middle load gear oil was injected. The gear on axial group I drives the gears on the gear pump, and the lubricating oil in the pump, under the action of centrifugal force, was pumped out through the oil tube to filter, which filters out impurities in the oil. After the cooling, the oil was transported by pipeline to the axial group III, axial group IV, axial group V, axial group VI and axial group VII. Each axial group and gear had special holes drilled, and the lubricating oil lubricated the mating surfaces through the hole as the gear turned.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we derive a {{possible}} mass profile {{for the low}} surface brightness galaxy, Malin 1, based upon previously published space-based and ground-based photometric properties and kinematics. We use properties of the bulge, normal disk, outer extended disk and H 1 mass as inputs into mass profile models. We find that the dark matter halo model of Malin 1 is best described by a halo profile that has undergone adiabatic contraction, inconsistent with the findings for most disk galaxies to date, yet consistent with rotation curve studies of M 31. More importantly, we find that Malin 1 is baryon dominated in its central regions out to a radius of ∼ 10 kpc (in the bulge region). Low-surface brightness galaxies are {{often referred to as}} being dark matter dominated at all radii. If this is the case, then Malin 1 would seem to have characteristics similar to those of normal barred disk galaxies, as suggested by other recent work. We also find that Malin 1 also falls on the rotation curve <b>shear</b> versus spiral <b>arm</b> pitch angle relation for normal galaxies, although more LSB galaxies need to be studied to determine if this is typical.

40|$|We {{present an}} updated mass model for M 31 that {{makes use of}} a Spitzer 3. 6 µm image, a mass-to-light ratio {{gradient}} based on the galaxy’s B − R colour profile, and observed rotation curve data {{from a variety of}} sources. We examine cases where the dark matter follows a pure NFW profile and where an initial NFW halo contracts adiabatically in response to the formation of the galaxy. We find that both of these scenarios can produce a reasonable fit to the observed rotation curve data. However, a pure NFW model requires a concentration cvir = 51 that is well outside the range predicted in ΛCDM cosmology and is therefore disfavoured. An adiabatically contracted NFW halo favors an initial concentration cvir = 20 and virial mass 8. 2 × 10 11 M⊙, and this is in line with the cosmological expectations for a galaxy of the size of M 31. The best-fit mass is consistent with published estimates from Andromeda Stream kinematics, satellite galaxy radial velocities, and planetary nebulae studies. Finally, using the known linear correlation between rotation curve <b>shear</b> and spiral <b>arm</b> pitch angle, we show that the stellar spiral arm pitch angle of M 31 (which cannot be deduced from imaging data due to the galaxy’s inclination) is P = 24. ◦ 7 ± 4. ◦ 4...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} updated mass model for M 31 that {{utilizes}} a deep 2 MASS K-band {{image of the}} Andromeda galaxy, a revised estimate of the stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L), and observed rotation curve data {{from a variety of}} sources. We examine cases where the dark matter follows a pure NFW profile and where an initial NFW halo contracts adiabatically in response to the formation of the galaxy. We find that the rotation curve data are most consistent with an adiabatically contracted NFW halo with an initial concentration c_vir= 12. 0 and virial mass 8. 7 x 10 ^{ 11 } M_sun. Models without adiabatic contraction are disfavored at high significance and specifically have difficulty reproducing the decline in rotation velocity at r> 15 kpc. Our best-fit M 31 virial mass is a factor of ~ 2 smaller than the most recent estimate from rotation curve fitting by Klypin et al. (2002). The difference is driven by our updated baryonic mass model. The best-fit mass is consistent with published estimates from Andromeda Stream kinematics, satellite galaxy radial velocities, and planetary nebulae studies.

The pilot, Cpl Robert Bush (Tristan Hickey), who is still alive, seeks to get his armored suit back and running and leave the battle area, which is under heavy jamming. Seeing two of the SDR's new Nutrocker (Nutcracker) robot hovertanks arrive nearby, Bush tries to hide, but bodily functions give him away. One Nutcracker gives chase and the SAFS AI points out to Bush how to defeat it. He eventually clambers on to the tank, which passes through the rubble of a town and randomly shoots at high places to bring down objects that could snag him. With the SAFS' right <b>arm</b> <b>sheared</b> off by the Nutcracker's laser blasts and snow settling in, Bush is knocked unconscious all night long from the fall while the tank breaks down under the cold.

40|$|We present high {{resolution}} maps (∼ 2 ^") {{maps of the}} J= 1 - 0 and J= 2 - 1 transitions of C^ 18 O in the central ∼ 150 pc of the gas-rich nucleus of IC 342, made with the Owens Valley Millimeter Array. From the C^ 18 O maps {{we are able to}} obtain the most accurate map of N_H_ 2 to date for IC 342. Due to their low opacities, the transitions of C^ 18 O give a more reliable estimate of the true molecular gas column density distribution than the more common ^ 12 CO and ^ 13 CO isotopomers. The morphology of the C^ 18 O emission in the nucleus is a mini-spiral {{similar to that of the}} main isotopomer, ^ 12 CO, except it is more symmetric, lacking the enhancements to north. We suggest that the asymmetries present in ^ 12 CO images may reflect the viewing perspective of the starburst region biased by the high optical depths of ^ 12 CO, rather than true asymmetries in the amount of molecular gas present. The giant molecular clouds seen in C^ 18 O appear to be nonspherical, probably due to tidal <b>arm</b> <b>shearing.</b> Column densities determined from C^ 18 O observations, 1. 3 mm dust continuum, and the virial theorem indicate that the standard Galactic conversion factor, X_CO, overestimates the amount of molecular gas in the center of IC 342 by a factor of ∼ 2 - 3 at the molecular cloud peaks, and by > 3 in the diffuse gas away from the starburst. Revised molecular masses based on this conversion factor imply that star formation efficiencies in the starburst region are very high. From the distribution of gas and star formation it appears that the sites of star formation are dynamically determined, rather than driven by density peaks. Near the central star-forming region, evidence is seen for chemical enrichment of C^ 18 O due to massive stars.
