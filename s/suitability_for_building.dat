40|$|Abstract A {{growing amount}} of Linked Data – graph-structured data {{accessible}} at sources distributed across the Web – enables advanced data integration and decision-making applications. Typical systems operat-ing on Linked Data collect (crawl) and pre-process (in-dex) {{large amounts of}} data, and evaluate queries against a centralised repository. Given that crawling and in-dexing are time-consuming operations, the data in the centralised index {{may be out of}} date at query execu-tion time. An ideal query answering system for query-ing Linked Data live should return current answers in a reasonable amount of time, even on corpora as large as the Web. In such a live query system source selec-tion – determining which sources contribute answers to a query – is a crucial step. In this article we propose to use lightweight data summaries for determining rele-vant sources during query evaluation. We compare sev-eral data structures and hash functions with respect to their <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>building</b> such summaries, stress-ing benefits for queries that contain joins and require ranking of results and sources. We elaborate on join variants, join ordering and ranking. We analyse the dif-ferent approaches theoretically and provide results of an extensive experimental evaluation. ...|$|E

The potential range of such indicators is very broad, depending {{on the level of}} policy/decision-making and the type of information needed. Indicators may apply from micro level situations (a single product/process/technology/site) to macro scale policy areas (e. g., EU thematic strategies). A further differentiation can be made for each level, depending on the life-cycle phase under consideration: resources, products, or waste. The present study compares process-based life-cycle assessment (LCA), economic input-output analysis-based LCA (EIO-LCA), materials flow analysis and some relevant hybrid methods in order to assess their <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>building</b> up environmental indicators in different policy and decision-making contexts.

The high potential for cost reduction and the <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>building</b> integration have initiated both industrial and research laboratories dynamisms for amorphous silicon and micro-crystalline silicon based photovoltaic technologies. The recent progress towards higher efficiencies thin film silicon solar cells obtained at the IMT-EPFL in Neuchatel in small-area laboratory and semi-large-area industrial Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PE-CVD) systems are reviewed. Advanced light trapping schemes are fundamental to reach high conversion efficiency and the potential of advanced Transparent Conductive Oxides (TCO) is presented, together with issues associated {{to the impact of}} the substrate morphology onto the growth of the silicon films.

40|$|Seismic {{isolation}} through {{rubber bearing}} at structural base poses {{significant reduction in}} energy ensuring flexibility to the structure. The bearings act as earthquake induced load resisting system. This seismic load is predominant lateral load acting on building structures along with wind load. If wind load {{is much greater than}} the earthquake load, inserting isolator will bring no advantage in design. Furthermore, if the time period of a building without isolator is greater than the reasonable value, incorporation of isolator will not convey much difference to the building behavior with respect to seismic load. So the objective of the study is to examine the building structures in region of medium risk seismicity for dissimilar heights and plan area to predict critical height up to which energy dissipation bearing is competent. 108 numbers of models for different configurations of 4 to 30 stories structures have been built up. All the structures are analyzed in finite element approach subjected to proper lateral loading. The characteristics and functions of different kinds of isolators are introduced along with isolation <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>building</b> structures. The relationship among governing lateral load, building altitude and time period is evaluated as well. The study reveals that though seismic base shear governs up to larger building height, for higher tallness, the structure may experience larger time periods than the most suitably limiting value for incorporating isolator. Realistic structural analyses envisage that up to 30 similar to 40 m height seismic base isolator can be efficiently incorporated in medium risk seismic vicinity for RCC building structures...|$|E

40|$|The {{academic}} research into entanglement nicely illustrates {{the interplay between}} fundamental science and applications, {{and the need to}} foster both aspects to advance either one. For instance, the possibility to distribute entangled photons over tens or even hundreds of kilometers is fascinating because it confirms the quantum predictions over large distances, while quantum theory is often presented to apply to the very small (see Figure 1). On the other hand, entanglement enables quantum key distribution (QKD) [1]. This most advanced application of quantum information processing allows one to distribute cryptographic keys in a provably secure manner. For this, one merely has to measure the two halves of an entangled pair of photons. Surprisingly, and being of both fundamental and practical interest, the use of entanglement removes even the necessity for trusting most equipment used for the measurements [5]. Furthermore, entanglement serves as a resource for quantum teleportation (see Figure 2) [1]. In turn, this provides a tool for extending quantum key distribution to arbitrarily large distances and building large-scale networks that connect future quantum computers and atomic clocks [6]. In the following, we describe the counter-intuitive properties of entangled particles as well as a few recent experiments that address fundamental and applied aspects of quantum teleportation. While a lot of work is being done using different quantum systems, including trapped ions, color centers in diamond, quantum dots, and superconducting circuits, we will restrict ourselves to experiments involving photons due to their <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>building</b> future quantum networks.

40|$|A remote {{procedure}} call (RPC) mechanism permits the calling of procedures in another address space. RPC is a simple but highly effective mechanism for interprocess communication and enjoys nowadays a great popularity {{as a tool for}} building distributed applications. This popularity is partly a result of their overall simplicity but also partly a consequence of more than 20 years of research in transpaxent distribution that have failed to deliver systems that meet the expectations of real-world application programmers. During the same 20 years, persistent systems have proved their <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> <b>building</b> complex database applications by seamlessly integrating features traditionally found in database management systems into the programming language itself. Some research. effort has been invested on distributed persistent systems, but the outcomes commonly suffer from the same problems found with transparent distribution. In this thesis I claim that a higher-order persistent RPC is useful for building distributed persistent applications. The proposed mechanism is: realistic {{in the sense that it}} uses current technology and tolerates partial failures; understandable by application programmers; and general to support the development of many classes of distributed persistent applications. In order to demonstrate the validity of these claims, I propose and have implemented three models for distributed higher-order computation over autonomous persistent stores. Each model has successively exposed new problems which have then been overcome by the next model. Together, the three models provide a general yet simple higher-order persistent RPC that is able to operate in realistic environments with partial failures. The real strength of this thesis is the demonstration of realism and simplicity. A higherorder persistent RPC was not only implemented but also used by programmers without experience of programming distributed applications. Furthermore, a distributed persistent application has been built using these models which would not have been feasible with a traditional (non-persistent) programming language...|$|E

While in the past stadiums were wholly financed by public expenditure, current financial difficulties of the German government and especially of the municipalities, joint with the changes of the legal form of German football clubs, make it necessary and possible to search for alternative financing forms.

40|$|Abundance and {{diversity}} of small mammals are usually affected strongly by grazing either due to decreased food availability or quality, decreased <b>suitability</b> of soil <b>for</b> <b>building</b> burrow systems due to trampling and/or due to increased predation risk in the structurally simpler grazed areas. We estimated the effects of grazing-induced changes in vegetation and soil and of increased predation on small mammals in a Mediterranean grassland landscape. We measured vegetation structure, soil compaction and small mammal abundance and species composition in 22 plots of 8 Sherman live traps each, arranged according to an unbalanced two-way ANOVA design with two grazing levels (grazed areas and cattle exclosures) and two predator abundance levels (increased densities of Eurasian kestrels Falco tinnunculus by means of nest boxes and control). Plots were sampled during 2 consecutive years in early summer and early fall. Exclosure from cattle increased significantly vegetation height and volume and decreased soil compaction. Grazing-induced changes in vegetation height and volume and in soil compaction produced strong effects on small mammal abundance and species richness. Increased kestrel densities did not have significant additive or interactive effects, {{with the effects of}} grazing-induced vegetation and soil gradients on abundance or richness of small mammals. Our results suggest that the effects of grazing on small mammal communities in Mediterranean montane grasslands were mainly due to reduced food availability and by negative effects of trampling on the <b>suitability</b> of soils <b>for</b> <b>building</b> burrow systems. Decreased food quality and increased predation in grazed areas seemed to play a minor role, if any. Reductions in stock densities would then favor generalist predator populations in Mediterranean grasslands through the expected positive effects of such reductions on the availability of food and burrows for small mammals. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} 834 nests {{built by}} western lowland gorillas in Cameroon between July 2008 and July 2011 {{to identify the}} plant species used in their construction. Preference for each plant species for nesting was assessed using a 'preference index' calculated by combining information on the occurrence of each species in the forest and in the nests. Forty-six plant species representing about 15 % {{of the total number}} of species in the forest and 26 % of species used <b>for</b> nest <b>building</b> were frequently used by gorillas. Preference levels significantly varied among these species. Nests were mostly built with herbs of the families Marantaceae and Zingiberaceae and woody species such as Manniophyton fulvum (liana) and Alchornea floribunda (shrub). As observed in other gorilla populations, <b>suitability</b> <b>for</b> nest <b>building</b> and availability of gorilla food in stems were the likely determinants of plant selection. The total number of species used per nest ranged from 1 to 11, with an average of 4. 9. This is high compared to other sites, emphasizing variability in the availability of nest building materials and habitat differences across the range of the western gorilla. Seasonal changes in the use of different habitat types for nesting did not appear to influence plant use <b>for</b> nest <b>building</b> as there was little variation in plant selection across seasons or the composition of nests. Our findings suggest that gorillas non-randomly select plant species to build nests, and use a particular set of species combined at varying proportions, with no clear seasonal or spatial patterns...|$|R

Consequently, more CPU power {{in the form of}} servers will be needed and the DAQ network will grow to a capacity of 40 Tbps. A PC-based readout system would receive data incoming from the detector, which would then be scattered across builder nodes, and further distributed to a computing farm for data filtering. The design bandwidth of such a DAQ system requires rates as high as 400 Gbps single-duplex per node. These builder nodes will be connected with cost-effective, high-bandwidth data-centre switches in order to minimize the system cost. The behaviour of such an Event Building network can of course be studied in simulation but experience tells us that it is crucial to test, in particular to find out limitations in the switches themselves and to which extent various Event Building protocols can mitigate these limitations. We present a protocol, topology and transport independent emulation software named DAQ Protocol-Independent Performance Evaluator (DAQPIPE). It allows us to test different communication architectures, such as push or pull, with regards to the initiator of the communication. Different topologies and transport protocols can also be tested.
