50|$|The three {{adjacent}} {{rolls of}} a {{three roll mill}} (called the <b>feed</b> <b>roll,</b> centre roll and apron roll) rotate at progressively higher speeds. Material, usually {{in the form of}} paste, is fed between the <b>feed</b> <b>roll</b> and the center roll. Due to the narrowing space between the rolls, most of the paste initially remains in the feed region. The part that makes it through the first in-running nip experiences very high shear force due to the different rotation speeds of the two rolls. Upon exiting, the material that remains on the center roll moves through the second nip between the center roll and apron roll. This subjects it to an even higher shear force, due to the higher speed of the apron roll and typically, a smaller gap than between the <b>feed</b> and centre <b>rolls.</b> A knife blade then scrapes the processed material off the apron roll and the paste rolls down the apron. This milling cycle can be repeated several times to maximize dispersion.|$|R

40|$|The {{main results}} of the review of {{existing}} methods, methods, equipment for grinding, distribution of coarse forages, including <b>rolled</b> <b>feed,</b> on cattle–breeding farms are given in the article. This allows us to identify the main factors affecting the productivity of grinders — distributors {{and the quality of}} supply of finished material to feeders. On the basis of research works and analysis of existing technical means for the preparation and distribution of coarse forages, we propose a constructive technological scheme for a mobile shredder–distributor with a longitudinal arrangement of a knife–type working organ. Analysis of mobile shredders and distributors revealed that they should provide loading in the places of storage of coarse forages, transportation, grinding and dispensing in the feeding zone. The technical tool that performs the totality of the above operations is a dynamic system that operates under conditions of changing external influences. The model of the shredder–distributor functioning is proposed, which can be calculated with incoming variables that determine the conditions of its operation: <b>feeding</b> <b>feed</b> <b>roll,</b> which can be changed if necessary, as well as the physical and mechanical properties of the material, mainly density and humidity, which are uncontrollable factors and are monitored in advance experiments...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} weight {{reduction}} in automobiles {{to reduce fuel consumption}} pushed the spring manufacturer to choose higher-strength martensitic steels {{to reduce the}} resisting section of the wire, and for this reason the weight of the spring. The traditional approach in forming such materials is based on the hot coiling of the wire at high temperature to increase material formability and to reduce the required forming forces. Another approach is the cold forming process wherein the wire is heat treated before the spring is formed to improve its formability. In both cases the coiled spring has to be hardened and tempered to reach the target strength. Energy and time consumption due to the final heat treatment slow production and increase the manufacturing cost of the spring. The two-fold target of shortening the process cycle and reducing the weight of the spring was met successfully in cold forming the material in its final condition (hardened and tempered). In this case the coiling process becomes more critical because the formability of these high-strength martensitic steels is not very high. The trend of using high-strength steels (between 1800 and 2100 MPa) increases the difficulties in the cold forming of such wires and can lead to the failure of the coiled wire caused by the breakage of the spring. 1 - 3 The forming forces required in the coiling of the wire increase with the high strength of the material causing the feeding force to also increase. The <b>feeding</b> <b>rolls</b> should provide enough force to avoid the slip of the wire between the rolls. For this reason the friction between the wire and the <b>feeding</b> <b>rolls</b> should be at a high level to provide enough tangential force to avoid any slip of the wire. On the other hand, high friction increases the required forming force due to the higher contribution of friction forces developing in the stationary dies where the wire slides as in the guiding plate, in the bending die and in the bar controlling the axial pitch of the spring. The contribution made by the bending die can be reduced using two bending rolls where the sliding friction is substituted by a prevalent rolling friction. This solution has been successfully used by spring manufacturers, who still face the problem of friction in the remaining components of the coiling machine: in the feeding system the friction should be high and elsewhere should be low. The insertion of a lubricating station between feeding and forming can solve the problem, but can be difficult in the industrial application, generating a dirty area of the press and requiring a cleaning step after coiling to remove residual lubricant from the spring’s external surface. For these reasons, the spring manufacturer asks for a wire with an external oxide, which should act as a thin solid lubricant layer. If this layer is too thin, it can be broken when the wire is passing between the <b>feeding</b> <b>rolls,</b> causing a possible slip of the wire and an increase of friction in the forming section of the press. Slipping in the <b>feeding</b> <b>rolls</b> can be eliminated by increasing the radial pressure of the rolls on the wire, but this action can introduce damage to the wire and eventually can lead to failure in the coiling of the spring. The investigation has been focused on the effect of friction {{as well as on the}} set-up of the coiling machine, and it is based on a preliminary experimental analysis of different wires. Different samples of the same steel with different Fe-oxide layers have been tested in the coiling machine. Most of them allow the correct manufacture of the spring, but some result in the breakage of the spring during coiling. The samples have been characterized in the laboratory relative to mechanical properties, microstructure, thickness of the oxide layer and its morphology and type of oxide and its adherence to the steel underneath. Afterwards, a numerical model of the spring coiling process has been developed introducing the description of the Lemaitre damage model in the material properties. Relative damage has been used as the index to estimate the risk of failure when different friction and process parameters are used...|$|R

Laying hens were provided with a 5. 5 ppm 14 C-DON-spiked diet (. 55 mg DON;. 825 uCi/ bird/day) for a 65 -day period, after which they received a clean, unadulterated diet for 21 days. Total residues (based on specific radioactivity) increased daily until the 8 th day of » 4 C-DON exposure, when levels reached a plateau for several days, then decreased slowly thereafter. Maximum radioactivity measured was equivalent to 1. 7 u. g DON or metabolites per 60 -g egg; the yolk, albumen, and shell membrane contributed 70, 29, and 1 % of the total amount, respectively.
