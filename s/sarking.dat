5000|$|<b>Sarking</b> is an English {{word with}} {{multiple}} meanings in roof construction: ...|$|E
5000|$|The word <b>sarking</b> {{is further}} used {{as part of}} the term scrim and <b>sarking,</b> a method of {{interior}} construction widely used in Australia and New Zealand in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In this method, wooden panels were nailed over the beams and joists of the house frame, and a heavy, loosely woven cloth, called scrim, was then stapled or tacked over the top of this. This construction method allowed wallpaper to be applied directly to unplastered walls.|$|E
50|$|It is {{constructed}} from New Zealand native timbers, with stunning stained glass windows. The interior has been likened to the upturned hull of an Elizabethan galleon, with exposed curving rimu trusses and kauri roof <b>sarking.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2003, <b>Sarker</b> {{got married}} with Mahfuja Hoque <b>Sarker.</b> She {{works in a}} local private {{commercial}} bank. They have one son Ismail <b>Sarker</b> and one daughter Juwairyah Amreen <b>Sarker.</b> They reside in Banani, Dhaka.|$|R
50|$|Jatin <b>Sarker</b> {{was born}} on 1 September 1938 in Netrokona of the-then Mymensingh {{district}} in undivided India. Netrokona is now an administrative district of Bangladesh. He was the eldest of three children, two brothers and a sister. He married in 1965 and with his wife Kanon <b>Sarker</b> has one son, namely, Suman <b>Sarker</b> (he lives in Slovakia) and a daughter, namely, Sudipta Sarkar (she lives in Bangladesh). He has six grandchildren, namely Mishuk <b>Sarker,</b> Martin <b>Sarker,</b> Joy Tomáš <b>Sarker</b> and Omia <b>Sarker</b> - they live in Slovakia, Shagnik Sarkar and Rittik Sarkar live in Bangladesh.|$|R

50|$|In current usage in Australia, <b>sarking</b> {{refers to}} a {{laminated}} aluminium foil layer (commonly described as RFL, or reflective foil laminate) that is installed on the roof trusses, beneath the battens, supporting a tile or metal deck roof. It acts as additional radiative and convective insulation and provides a condensation barrier.|$|E
50|$|To the {{south-west}} of {{the village}} lies Claxton Church. It is thought that the Saxon settlement {{which would have been}} built around it moved down to the marsh edge in the Middle Ages. The church has a thatched scissor-beam roof with basketweave <b>sarking.</b> The flint tower is unbuttressed and dates from the 14th century, though much restored.|$|E
5000|$|In carpentry, scrim is {{the name}} given to a very heavy, coarsely-woven fabric similar to hessian or coarse canvas, which is {{stretched}} over interior boards to provide support for wallpaper and add an extra rigidity. This method of construction, widely used in older houses, {{is often referred to}} as [...] "scrim and sarking", the <b>sarking</b> being the board.|$|E

Like Alderney, it has {{legislative}} autonomy and laws passed by the States of Guernsey {{cannot be applied to}} <b>Sark</b> without approval of the <b>Sark</b> Legislature (known as the Chief Pleas). Same-sex marriage is not legal in <b>Sark.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} was of Venetian Gothic architecture. Concrete foundations and brick masonry walls {{were used in}} the original construction as well as the additions of 1907 and 1912. External and internal walls are of brick. The windows had sandstone facing features. The roof was characterised by timber <b>sarking</b> and slate sheathing. Roofing over the hall/library was replaced in 1989 after a fire.|$|E
50|$|The roof {{structure}} is exposed within the building, {{and the means}} of support are made explicit in the gothic tradition of a battle against gravity. The extensive use of timber for the roof, with exposed <b>sarking,</b> struts and rafters is typical of architect designed New Zealand houses of the 60's and 70's that delight in the virtuostic display of carpentry work.|$|E
5000|$|The use of wood panels, or [...] "sarking boards", called sheathing, {{sheeting}} or decking in American English, {{under the}} roof-covering {{materials such as}} the shingles of a roof to provide support. It is a common term in Scotland, Australia, and New Zealand. The shingles or slates are nailed directly to the <b>sarking</b> boards without timber battens, providing a strong, wind-resistant roof.|$|E

50|$|In 1993, <b>SARK</b> created Camp <b>SARK,</b> LLC, {{a company}} which created {{products}} inspired by her artwork. The company's sales were strong, but {{it failed to}} return on investments, and <b>SARK</b> relaunched it as Planet <b>SARK</b> in 2003, focusing the company on publishing, events, and online commerce. The new company was more successful than its predecessor.|$|R
50|$|Cast iron {{columns and}} arched spans support the trainshed roof, which is slated on wooden <b>sarking</b> in the {{standard}} Scottish manner. The roof trusses are of wrought iron tension members and cast iron posts, and all the ironwork is detailed in a light classical style. At Bo'ness, as at Haymarket, there are no smoke ventilators, though smoke troughs {{have been added to}} reduce soiling from locomotive exhausts.|$|E
50|$|In modern turf roof construction, bitumen {{roofing felt}} {{combined}} with dimpled plastic drainage membranes are usually used {{in place of}} birch bark. Bitumen roofing felt is nailed to the <b>sarking</b> and a dimpled cavity drainage membrane is laid over the top (dimples face down) to form a drainage layer. The turf is then laid over this drainage layer. Turf roofs are still widely used on newly built cabins in Norway.|$|E
50|$|Slate {{roof tiles}} are usually fixed (fastened) either with nails, or with hooks as is common with Spanish slate. In the UK, fixing is {{typically}} with double nails onto timber battens (England and Wales) or nailed directly onto timber <b>sarking</b> boards (Scotland and Northern Ireland). Nails were traditionally of copper, {{although there are}} modern alloy and stainless steel alternatives. Both these methods, if used properly, provide a long-lasting weathertight roof with a lifespan of around 80-100 years. Slate roofs are still used today.|$|E

5000|$|Since 2009, a local {{resident}} on <b>Sark</b> {{has set up}} {{a weekly}} online newspaper called The <b>Sark</b> Newspaper (earlier: The <b>Sark</b> Newsletter). The publisher is a former longtime employee of the super-rich Barclay brothers who own the small neighboring island of Brecqhou. The publication has compared the local government of <b>Sark</b> [...] "to fascist Germany in the 1930s". In 2014, over 50 residents of <b>Sark</b> filed complaints with the police against accusations made by the paper.Since 2011, a quarterly magazine called <b>Sark</b> Life, which promotes a positive view of the island and welcomes contributions, is published by the Sark-based publishing company Small Island Publishing.|$|R
5000|$|Floors are of {{concrete}} slab construction and paved with flagstones internally. The walls are {{a combination of}} in-situ concrete and concrete block. Walls have a rough plaster finish both inside and out, and concrete block walls are left exposed. The roof is of timber framed construction and was originally clad with asbestos shingles. The main roof {{is supported by a}} central timber post and braced with timber struts. The ceiling features exposed rafters and timber <b>sarking.</b> The triangular clerestory windows are formed of gridded clear and coloured perspex.

5000|$|Roofing felt (similar to tar paper) is {{the base}} {{material}} {{used to make}} roof shingles and roll roofing. Used for decades as waterproof coverings in residential and commercial roofs, these bitumen compositional membranes incorporate two layers. The first underside polymer membrane {{is used as a}} solid background, often reinforced with glass fibers. Mineral granules make up the self-protective top layer, with a final bituminous mixture encapsulating them both. Typical uses of felt paper are as an underlay(ment) (<b>sarking)</b> beneath other building materials, particularly roofing and siding materials, and is one type of membrane used in asphalt built up roofing (BUR) systems. The purposes are to [...] "...separate the roof covering from the roof deck...shed water...and provide secondary weather protection..." [...] Also, the rapid application of roofing underlay protects the roof deck during construction until the roofing material is applied and is required for roofs required to meet Underwriters Laboratory (UL) fire ratings. The separation of the roof covering from the roof deck protects the roof covering from resins in some sheathing materials and cushions unevenness and old nails and splinters in re-roofing applications. The underlayment also sheds water, which penetrates the roof covering from an ordinary leak, a leak from wind-driven rain or snow, wind damage to the roof covering, or ice dams. However, the application of underlays may increase the roof temperature, which {{is the leading cause of}} ageing of asphalt shingles and felt paper wrinkles when it gets wet, which (rarely) shows through asphalt shingles. Not installing an underlay may void the roof covering warranty.|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} of {{noise from the}} outside environment into dwellings is often {{a concern for the}} inhabitants. However, the {{transmission of}} the noise through the roof is often overlooked when the sound insulation of the dwelling is being assessed unless the dwelling is located near an airport. The transmission of noise through the roof system depends not only on the performance of the roof cladding, but also on the structure-borne noise attenuation of the trusses, the ceiling and the ceiling insulation. In this investigation, the sound insulation of different configurations of roofing systems were evaluated in the laboratory. The configurations tested included variations in the cladding, the <b>sarking</b> installed under the cladding, the thickness of the insulation installed between the ceiling joists and the ceiling construction. The outcome of the study will help to improve the acoustic performance of roofing systems as well as to assist architects in the selection of roofing systems...|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{optimize}} the envelope thermal design of free-running urban residential buildings in Malawi. It specifically set out to improve the urban residential buildings’ thermal comfort and suggest optimal envelope thermal design features for these buildings. The research study was primarily dependent on computer simulations in EnergyPlus to replicate the typical Malawian urban residential building’s thermal behaviour and then study the impacts of various envelope configurations on the thermal comfort conditions registered in the building. The simulation model was experimentally validated to check its appropriateness to the climatic design conditions prevalent in Malawi {{and out of the}} three major cities that were considered, the model was found to be appropriate for use in the two cities of Mzuzu and Lilongwe leaving out the city of Blantyre. The optimization methodology that was employed involved the use of orthogonal arrays, statistical analyses and the listing method. It was found that the optimal envelope thermal design, which registered up to 18 % lower discomfort hours than that of the typical urban residential building, consists of a 50 mm concrete floor slab, 230 mm burnt brick walls with an external layer of 19 mm EPS, tiled roof with an internal layer of <b>sarking</b> and 50 mm EPS, double Low-E Glazing with a transparency ratio of 45 % and 0. 2408 m 2 of adaptable operational surface area for the air bricks. Out of all the envelope features that were studied, air infiltration registered the most significant contribution towards the ultimate residential building thermal performance. It was demonstrated that controlled air infiltration through the use of operable air bricks whose operational surface area is adaptable can be very effective in enhancing the building’s comfort levels. It was further observed that excessive insulation of the building envelope generally has a detrimental effect on the indoor space thermal comfort levels...|$|E
