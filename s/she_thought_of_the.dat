25|$|A notable remark of {{hers was}} made to the English soprano Adelaide Kemble when they {{attended}} the late concert in London by the great Italian soprano Giuditta Pasta, who was clearly past her prime. Asked by Kemble what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voice, she replied 'Ah! It is a ruin, but then so is Leonardo's Last Supper.|$|E
500|$|One early promo for 30 Rock portrayed Alec Baldwin mistakenly {{thinking}} {{he would meet}} Sorkin, and when asked on her [...] "Ask Tina" [...] space what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criticism that 30 Rock received, Fey jokingly replied that {{people who did not}} like it were probably confusing it with Studio 60. However, none of 30 Rocks producers have given Studio 60 any serious criticism, positive or negative. In a November 1, 2006 interview, Fey said she had seen the first two episodes of Studio 60. When asked what her impressions were, she jokingly replied, [...] "I can't do impressions of Bradley Whitford and Matthew Perry." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} songs that was {{recorded}} for the album was [...] "Fantasy". While Carey began developing new ideas for Daydream, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song [...] "Genius of Love" [...] by Tom Tom Club. She {{had always been a}} fan of the song, and presented Dave Hall with the idea of sampling the song's hook. Hall incorporated a groove that he felt complimented Carey's voice, while she composed some of the other beats and wrote the lyrics. Carey recorded a remix to the song as well, featuring hip-hop verses from O.D.B of the Wu-Tang Clan, as well as production from Puffy. She spoke highly of the remix, complimenting Puffy and O.D.B, [...] "He's so known in the street, and he's one of the best people out there...we kind of did what we both do and having O.D.B took it to another level. He was my ultimate choice, so I was really happy with the way it turned out." [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] was a song that Carey wrote with the R group Boyz II Men. After Carey's friend and past collaborator David Cole died, she began writing and developing a song that would pay homage to him and all the friends and family her fans had lost along life's journey. Carey had the chorus and concept composed, and after meeting with Boyz II Men, they realized they too had a similar idea in development. Together, using Carey's chorus and idea, as well as the melody they had produced, they wrote and composed the song. It was produced by Afanasieff, who built on the song's melody and added various grooves and beats.|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> {{particularly}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mobile animation <b>of</b> his face, <b>the</b> keen flash <b>of</b> enthusiasm in {{his thoughts}} and expressions....|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> saints, {{whose lives}} {{she had been}} reading. Her young heart quivered at <b>the</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> their sacrifices, their martyrdoms, their sense of duty.|$|R
2500|$|Music {{critics in}} Japan responded {{positively}} to [...] "Yoru no Odoriko", with both CDJournal reviewers and music reviewer Tetsuo Hiraga writing for Billboard Japan {{feeling that the}} song expressed an essential, core identity and style of Sakanaction. CDJournal reviewers praised the first verse's [...] "detached synths and a simple four-on-the-floor rhythm" [...] mixed with an [...] "unconcerned melody with a trance-like backing". They felt that as the song progressed through its [...] "trance-like" [...] structure which gave {{a sense of being}} on a dance floor, it gradually built up to an emotionally satisfying chorus. They further praised Yamaguchi's [...] "human" [...] vocals, feeling the techniques he used showed a J-Pop style to them, and the song's [...] "catchy melody". Hiraga called the song a further re-imagination of the band's dance music sound, praising the song's [...] "fresh lyrics and melody". Hanako Fujita of Rockin' On Japan felt similarly about the song's [...] "literary" [...] lyrics and sound, believing that the song's progression showed off Sakanaction's [...] "musical charm". <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song's lyrical message as being very effective, and believed that listeners could happily let the song take over themselves because of its [...] "vivid and steady world of sound".|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chance {{which had}} been given, but said nothing.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not need}} to say what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advice the little villain gave.|$|E
60|$|Violet hesitated. She {{was really}} longing {{only to be}} alone and to rest. <b>She</b> <b>thought,</b> however, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor invalid to whom their meeting at dinner-time was <b>the</b> one break <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day.|$|R
60|$|Miss Baker met him {{as though}} {{there had been no}} breach in their former intimacy. With her, for the moment, Lady Harcourt and her {{troubles}} were forgotten, and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> only <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dying man upstairs.|$|R
60|$|Moonlight {{accompanied}} {{this remark}} with a merry laugh, as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eccentricities <b>of</b> her little companion.|$|R
60|$|She {{sat in the}} car, vaguely {{thinking}} {{over the}} events of the past few days, whilst watching the throng of rowdy merrymakers seething around her. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> noble-hearted, proud woman whom she had helped to bring from her beautiful English home to sorrow and humiliation in a dank French prison, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gallant English gentleman with his pleasant voice and courtly, debonnair manners.|$|E
60|$|Her eyes {{rested on}} him for a moment, questioning, as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meaning of his speech.|$|E
6000|$|Helen shuddered. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tame deer down at Dale's camp. How {{beautiful}} and graceful, and responsive to kindness! ...|$|E
60|$|Joan waited till <b>the</b> last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{congregation}} had disappeared, {{and then}} joined the little pew-opener who {{was waiting to}} close the doors. Joan asked her what <b>she</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sermon, but Mary Stopperton, being a little deaf, had not heard it.|$|R
5000|$|After JK Rowling, author <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Harry Potter series, {{revealed}} that <b>she</b> always <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character Albus Dumbledore as being homosexual, Harvey asked, [...] "Will we allow {{our kids to}} believe it would be perfectly appropriate for <b>the</b> headmaster <b>of</b> any school to be homosexual?" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{while she}} felt miserable {{and not a}} little forlorn she didn't want to see anybody, least of all Andor. Whenever <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Andor, <b>the</b> same remorse about BÃ©la gnawed again at her heart, for when <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him <b>she</b> not only felt at peace, but {{it seemed as if}} a ray <b>of</b> {{happiness}} illumined <b>the</b> past darkness <b>of</b> her life.|$|R
60|$|Sydney's heart ached when <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{separation}} {{that was}} to come with the next day; her despair forced its way to expression in words.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you {{everything}};--that is, everything I can." [...] And Grace blushed as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> one secret which she certainly would not tell.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> little turkeys {{wandering}} in the grass, {{of the children}} sleeping at last, of the quiet, wonderful stars. Then <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cows left unmilked, and listened to them stirring uneasily in the yard. She rose, at last, and stole forth. She could not rid herself of the thought that they would suffer. She knew what the dull ache in the full breasts of a mother was, {{and she could not}} let them stand at the bars all night moaning for relief.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> tearing through <b>the</b> sucker {{rootlets}} one by one, and {{in another}} minute she had released him and was dragging {{him away from the}} horror.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where indeed?" [...] said Mrs. Million; and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> herself, sitting <b>the</b> most {{considered}} personage in {{this grand}} castle, and yet with sufficiently base blood flowing in her veins.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you care? What {{does any}} man care? Oh! if <b>she</b> had only <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men as I think, {{she might have}} been living now!" ...|$|R
6000|$|And at {{the same}} instant, came the ironical question: 'What for?' <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colliers' wives, with their {{linoleum}} and their lace curtains and their little girls in high-laced boots. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wives and daughters of the pit-managers, their tennis-parties, and their terrible struggles to be superior each to the other, in the social scale. There was Shortlands with its meaningless distinction, the meaningless crowd of the Criches. There was London, the House of Commons, the extant social world. My God! ...|$|E
60|$|Nor was Geraldine {{devoid of}} the old prick, when <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> degrees in the social scale in {{connection}} with the words about tradesmen and merchants.|$|E
60|$|Louisa's sad face brightened; Louisa's faint {{heart beat}} quick. A spark of her mistress's spirit flew {{up into her}} eyes as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> golden future.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes indeed," [...] said Mrs. Orme, wiping a tear {{away from}} her eye as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> {{troubles}} present and to come. [...] "It is the saddest thing. Poor lady! It would almost break your heart {{if you were to}} see her. Since first she heard of this, which was before Christmas, she has not had one quiet moment." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{this way}} six years passed by, and his eighteenth {{birthday}} drew near. When <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> this <b>the</b> queen's heart sank within her, {{for he was}} <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> her eyes' and how was she to send him forth to the unknown dangers that beset a pilgrim? So day by day she grew more and more sorrowful, {{and when she was}} alone wept bitterly.|$|R
60|$|When I told Emma she was {{a little}} upset, but being a {{sensible}} woman she soon saw <b>the</b> force <b>of</b> my arguments and fell in with the situation. In truth, unselfish creature that <b>she</b> was, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advantage that would accrue to me by this formal burying <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hatchet than <b>of</b> her own prejudices or convenience.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{misrepresentation}} and {{scandal that}} would ensue {{if she were}} no wife. One cause for thankfulness accompanied the reflection; Edward knew the truth.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark plantation, [...] And the hares, and her husband's blood, And {{the voice}} of her indignation [...] Rose up to the throne of God.|$|E
60|$|And then, poor woman, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{long years}} {{between her and}} rest, and leaning {{her head against the}} gate-post, began to cry bitterly in the gloom.|$|E
50|$|When she was {{a sophomore}} in college, she participated in a model {{audition}} from a form invited by her friend and won the Grand Prix.

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Reginald; <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{difficult}} {{part in the}} boy's sick chamber which the priest had assumed, and thankfully complied. Father Barry watched her handle each lily with reverent touch. One by one she laid them down, then turned and smiled.|$|R
