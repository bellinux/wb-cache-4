40|$|International audienceA multiproxy study {{coupling}} mineralogical, {{grain size}} and geochemical approaches {{was used to}} tentatively retrace eolian and fluvial contributions to sedimentation in the <b>Sicilian</b> Tunisian <b>Strait</b> since the last glacial. The eolian supply is dominant over the whole interval, excepted during the sapropel Si when riverine contribution apparently became significant. Saharan contribution increased during the B 011 ing Allerod, evidencing the persistence of aridity over North Africa although the northern Mediterranean already experienced moister and warmer conditions. The Younger Dryas is marked by proximal dust inputs, highlighting intense regional eolian activity. A southward migration of dust provenance toward Sahel occurred {{at the onset of}} the Holocene, likely resulting from a southward position of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone that was probably associated with a large-scale atmospheric reorganization. Finally, a peculiar high terrigenous flux associated with drastic modifications of the mineralogical and geochemical sediment signature occurred during the sapropel 51, suggesting the propagation of fine particles derived from major floodings of the Nile River resulting from enhanced rainfall on northeastern Africa and their transportation across the <b>Sicilian</b> Tunisian <b>Strait</b> by intermediate water masses...|$|R

50|$|The actual {{promontory}} of Pelorus, {{as already}} mentioned, {{is a low}} spit or point of sand, about 3 km in length, which has evidently been thrown up by the currents, which flow with great rapidity through the straits. A tradition, reported by Diodorus, but as ancient {{as the time of}} Hesiod, represented it as an artificial work constructed by the giant Orion. Within this sandy point, between the beach and the hills, are enclosed two small lakes or pools which are famous for producing the best eels and cockles in Sicily, a reputation they already enjoyed in ancient times, as the cockles of Pelorus are repeatedly noticed by Athenaeus; and Solinus, who mentions the lakes in question, speaks of them as abounding in fish. There appear to have been three of them in his day, but the marvels which he relates of one of them are purely fabulous. A temple of Neptune stood in ancient times upon the promontory, as well as a lighthouse or Pharos, the memory of which is retained in the modern name of Punta del Faro, by which the cape is still known. This appellation seems to hare indeed come into use before the close of the Roman Empire, as Servius, in describing the width of the <b>Sicilian</b> <b>strait,</b> measures it a Columna usque ad Pharon. But no remains of either building are now visible.|$|E

25|$|Tyndaris again bore a {{considerable}} {{part in the}} war between Sextus Pompeius and Octavian (36 BC). It {{was one of the}} points occupied and fortified by the former, when preparing for the defence of the <b>Sicilian</b> <b>straits,</b> but was taken by Agrippa after his naval victory at Mylae, and became one of his chief posts, from which he carried on offensive warfare against Pompey. Subsequently to this we hear nothing more of Tyndaris in history; but there is no doubt of its having continued to subsist throughout the period of the Roman Empire. Strabo speaks of it as one of the places on the north coast of Sicily which, in his time, still deserved the name of cities; and Pliny gives it the title of a Colonia. It is probable that it received a colony under Augustus, as we find it bearing in an inscription the titles of Colonia Augusta Tyndaritanorum. Pliny indeed mentions a great calamity which the city had sustained, when (he tells us) half of it was swallowed up by the sea, probably from an earthquake having caused the fall of part of the hill on which it stands, but we have no clue to the date of this event; The Itineraries attest the existence of Tyndaris, apparently still as {{a considerable}} place, in the fourth century.|$|R
40|$|The {{geological}} and climatic {{history of}} the Mediterranean basin over the last 6 million years has been determinant in shaping current geographic distribution of genetic variation in organisms. Phylogeographical approaches are considered one of most useful analysis for unraveling the evolutionary history of species. The Helichrysum pendulum complex {{is a group of}} three closely related plant species distributed in several islands and isolated continental localities of the Western-Central Mediterranean basin, providing an ideal case of study to analyze the processes involved in modelling its current genetic structure. Two cpDNA region rpl 32 -trnL intergenic spacer and the nrDNA region ETS were sequenced for 1 - 8 individuals from each of the 44 total populations sampled, covering the whole geographic range of the complex. Our results suggest that the complex originated in northern Africa and colonized several islands and continental areas of the northern Basin through the Gibraltar and <b>Sicilian</b> <b>straits</b> during phases of low sea level, favored by long distance dispersal events. While ETS data suggest a model of isolation by distance and show a main genetic barrier between populations of Western and Central Mediterranean areas, the rpl 32 -trnL reveals the existence of two divergent and not geographically structured haplotype groups within the complex. Ancient hybridization events among lineages of sect. Stoechadina are suggested as the most plausible cause for the haplotypes pattern observed, while several evidences of current hybridization between H. pendulum and several species of sect. Stoechadina are also detected in ETS data...|$|R
40|$|The common {{or brown}} shrimp Crangon crangon (L.) {{is a highly}} {{abundant}} and important taxon, both ecologically and commercially, yet knowledge on its population structure and historical biogeography is limited. We studied population genetic structure across the distribution range of this species by sequencing a 388 bp fragment of the cytochrome-c-oxidase I gene for 140 individuals from 25 locations. Strong population structuring {{and high levels of}} genetic diversity were observed. Four main phylogroups were uncovered: northeastern Atlantic, western Mediterranean, Adriatic Sea and Black Sea. Gene flow of these shrimp across known oceanographical barriers (e. g., the Strait of Gibraltar and/or Oran-Almeria front, <b>Sicilian</b> <b>Straits,</b> and Turkish Straits) is severely restricted. The oldest and most variable populations currently inhabit the western Mediterranean. The observed absence of structure across the entire northeastern Atlantic shelf is proposed not to be due to gene flow, but to relatively recent colonization following the glacial cycles of the late Pleistocene. Black Sea shrimp are currently disconnected from Mediterranean populations, and colonization is inferred, on the basis of coalescent analysis, to have happened relatively recently, but possibly earlier than 7000 years ago. We postulate the hypothesis that C. crangon survived the last brackish-water (< 7 ‰) period inside the Black Sea and/or one of the adjacent inland seas. We conclude that (1) common shrimp populations from different basins are strongly differentiated, (2) gene flow across basins is probably very limited, and (3) the biogeographic history of the taxon is largely in accordance with the geographic history of its distribution range. This study provides further evidence that high population connectivity of marine species (e. g., by policy makers) should not be assumed...|$|R

40|$|The Mediterranean and Black Seas {{are unique}} marine environments subject to {{important}} anthropogenic pressures due to riverine and atmospheric inputs of organic pollutants. Here we report {{the results obtained}} during two east-west sampling cruises in June 2006 and May 2007 from Barcelona to Istanbul and Alexandria respectively where water and plankton samples were collected simultaneously. Both matrices were analized for hexaclorochyclohexanes (HCHs), hexachlorobencene (HCB) and 41 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeneres. The comparison of the measured HCB and HCHs concentrations with previously reported dissolved phase concentrations suggests a temporal decline in their concentrations since the 1990 s. On the contrary, PCB seawater concentrations did not exhibited such a decline, but show a significant spatial variability in dissolved concentrations with lower levels in the open Western and South Eastern Mediterranean, and higher concentrations in the Black, Marmara, Aegean sea and <b>Sicilian</b> <b>Strait.</b> PCB and OCPs (organochlorine pesticides) concentrations in plankton were higher when lower concentrations of biomass occurred, but the intensity of this trend depended on the compound hydrophobicity (KOW). For the more persistent PCBs and HCB, the described differential dependence of POP concentrations in plankton versus biomass {{can be explained by}} interactions between air-water exchange, particle settling and/or bioaccumulation processes, whereas degradation processes ocurring in the photic zone drive the trends showed by the more labile HCHs. The results presented here are the most extensive data set available for the Mediterranean Sea and provide clear evidence of the important physical and biogeochemical controls on POP occurrence in the marine environmentJRC.

40|$|Polychlorobiphenyls (PCB) and {{organochlorine}} (OC) pesticides are endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The Italian Ministry of Environment {{has undertaken}} a program (1999 – 2001) to measure levels of contaminants in top marine predators {{and to develop}} sensitive biomarkers {{for the evaluation of}} toxicological risk in these species. In 1999, 15 swordfishes (Xiphias gladius) taken from the Mediterranean Sea along the <b>Sicilian</b> coast (<b>Strait</b> of Messina, Italy) and in the Atlantic Ocean along the Azores Islands, and analysed for 34 congeners of PCBs and 27 organochlorine (OC) pesticides in gonad, muscle, liver and blubber tissues.

40|$|AbstractExtending {{across a}} peninsular strip going from Gioia Tauro to Melito Porto Salvo on the Calabrian side, and from Milazzo to Giardini Naxos on the <b>Sicilian</b> side, the <b>Strait</b> of Sicily sees theAspromonte massif and the Peloritani {{mountain}} range as two facing stage sets of land sketching {{in the gulf}} a water piazza of a landscaping room. Described in the proposal by Giuseppe and Alberto Samonà, Ludovico Quaroni, Antonio Quistelli, Sergio Musmeci, Paolo D’Orsi Villani and Leonardo Urbani, it outlines, in the county seats of Reggio Calabria and Messina, the prevalence of a Euclidean space, identifiable in the exact metrics given by the recurrence of the measuring step of the blocks drawn in the reconstruction plans. The geographical dimension and the human nature of the district identify into the longitudinal extension the characterizing element of a territory {{and with it the}} main issue of its own logistics coverage. In this scenario the water piazza of the Strait is cut through on a daily basis by the network linking the two sides, like strings of commuter traffic between two strips of land whose distance has always been too small to make out their separate destinies yet too broad to facilitate their joining. It follows the need to reflect upon the infrastructure of the entire surrounding area which, while proposing a study on the themes of accessibility and crossing, also outlines a strategy running on harbours and airports as gateways to the entire area to scale with nature and the size of its traffic...|$|R
