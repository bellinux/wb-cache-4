5000|$|Humidity - If {{the wires}} {{connecting}} the strain gauge to the <b>signal</b> <b>conditioner</b> are not protected against humidity, such as bare wire, corrosion can occur, leading to parasitic resistance. This can allow currents to flow between the wires and the substrate {{to which the}} strain gauge is glued, or between the two wires directly, introducing an error which competes with the current flowing through the strain gauge. For this reason, high-current, low-resistance strain gauges (120 ohm) are less prone {{to this type of}} error. To avoid this error it is sufficient to protect the strain gauges wires with insulating enamel (e.g., epoxy or polyurethane type). Strain gauges with unprotected wires may be used only in a dry laboratory environment but not in an industrial one.|$|E

40|$|A {{continuous}} capacitance sensor {{was developed}} and an analog <b>signal</b> <b>conditioner</b> was evaluated to demonstrate the acceptability of these items {{for use in the}} space shuttle propellant loading system. An existing basic sensor concept was redesigned to provide capability for cryogenic operation, to improve performance, and to minimize production costs. Sensor development verification consisted of evaluation of sensor linearity, cryogenic performance, and stability during vibration. The <b>signal</b> <b>conditioner</b> evaluation consisted mainly of establishing the effects of the variations in temperature and cable parameters and evaluating the stability. A sensor linearity of 0. 04 in. was achieved over most of the sensor length. The sensor instability caused by vibration was 0. 04 percent. The cryogenic performance data show a maximum instability of 0. 19 percent at liquid hydrogen temperature; a theoretical calibration can be computed a within 1 percent. The <b>signal</b> <b>conditioner</b> evaluation showed that, with temperature compensation, all error sources typically contribute much less than 1 percent. An estimate of the accuracy achievable with the sensor and <b>signal</b> <b>conditioner</b> shows an rss estimate of 0. 75 in. for liquid oxygen and 1. 02 in. for liquid hydrogen.

40|$|Jitter is a {{phenomenon}} troubling many designers of highspeed interfaces. It reduces available timing margin, limits transmission distance between a transmitter and a receiver, and increases system cost by demanding better performing and more expensive interconnects.
