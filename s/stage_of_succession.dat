2500|$|Optimal meadow vole habitat {{consists}} of moist, dense grassland with {{substantial amounts of}} plant litter. [...] Habitat selection is largely influenced by relative ground cover of grasses and forbs; soil temperature, moisture, sodium, potassium, and pH levels; humidity; and interspecific competition. Meadow voles are most commonly associated with sites having high soil moisture. [...] They are often restricted to the wetter microsites when they occur in sympatry with prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) or montane voles. [...] In an Iowa prairie restoration project, meadow voles experienced an initial population increase during the initial stage of vegetation succession (old field dominated by foxtail grass (Setaria spp.), red clover (Trifolium pratense), annual ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), and thistles Cirsium spp.). However, populations reached their peak abundance during the perennial grass <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> from old field to tallgrass prairie.

50|$|In {{northern}} regions, snowshoe hares occupy conifer {{and mixed}} forests in all <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> but early successional forests foster peak abundance. Deciduous forests are usually occupied only in early <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession.</b> In New England, snowshoe hares preferred second-growth deciduous, coniferous, and mixed woods with dense brushy understories; {{they appear to}} prefer shrubby old-field areas, early- to mid-successional burns, shrub-swamps, bogs, and upper montane krumholz vegetation. In Maine, snowshoe hares were more active in clearcut areas than in partially cut or uncut areas.

50|$|The cyclic {{model of}} {{succession}} was proposed in 1947 by British ecologist Alexander Watt. In a seminal paper on vegetation patterns in grass, heath, and bog communities, Watt describes the plant {{community is a}} regenerating entity consisting of a “space-time mosaic” of species, whose cyclic behavior can be characterized by patch dynamics. Based on the current composition and its corresponding <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> he explains, a community can either be in an ‘upgrade’ phase toward late-successional shrubs or ‘downgrade’ degenerate phase toward grasses. These phases would occur in a predictable cycle. Watt’s study has since become a classic example frequently cited in scientific ecology.|$|E
50|$|The {{roe deer}} is {{primarily}} crepuscular, very quick and graceful, {{and lives in}} woods, although it may venture into grasslands and sparse forests. They feed mainly on grass, leaves, berries, and young shoots. They particularly like very young, tender grass with a high moisture content, i.e., grass that has received rain the day before. Roe deer will not generally venture into a field that has had or has livestock (sheep, cattle) in it because the livestock make the grass unclean.

50|$|The American beech is a shade-tolerant species, favoring shade {{more than}} other trees, {{commonly}} found in forests in the final <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession.</b> Ecological succession is essentially the process of forests changing their composition through time; it is a pattern of events often observed on disturbed sites. Although sometimes found in pure stands, it is more often associated with sugar maple (forming the beech-maple climax community), yellow birch, and Eastern hemlock, typically on moist well drained slopes and rich bottomlands. Near its southern limit, it often shares canopy dominance with Southern Magnolia. Although it {{has a reputation for}} slow growth (sometimes only 13 feet in 20 years), rich soil and ample moisture will greatly speed the process up. American beech favors a well-watered, but also well-drained spot and is intolerant of urban pollution, salt, and soil compaction. It also casts dense shade and has an extensive network of shallow, fibrous surface roots that make gardening underneath it almost impossible. Because American beech needs plenty of moisture and rich soil to thrive, it naturally occurs in bottomland forests. Early settlers often looked for beeches as a sign of a good potential place to clear the forest for farming.|$|E

40|$|The {{mycorrhizal}} {{status of}} two plant communities representing an initial stage (1 - 2 year-old) and a 8 - 9 -year-old <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> on spoil heaps from fireloam mining in Lower Silesia, Poland, was determined. In the initial stage, the mycorrhizal structures were not observed in 39 % of the investigated species; they {{were members of}} the Polygonaceae, Chenopodiaceae and Poaceae families. The relative cover of non-mycorrhizal plants exceeded 50 % and the major role was played by the Polygonum aviculare population, which predominated the whole community. Mycorrhizal species (arbuscular mycorrhizae) contributed to 61 % of the composition of the initial phyto-coenosis. The most numerous taxa were those with 20 - 40 % of the root length colonized, with a small number of arbuscules (0. 2 - 3. 1 % of the root length containig arbuscules) and no vesicles. In the advanced <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> mycorrhizal plants definitely dominated and the major role was played by the Tussilago farfara population. Compared with the initial stage, the later one also harboured more plants with mycorrhizas occupied > 40 % of the root length, as well as containing numerous arbuscules (> 20 % of the root length) and vesicles. The non-mycorrhizal species, i. e., Equisetum arvense and Poa compressa, represented 11 % o': the community composition and their relative cover amounted to 3 %. Despite the relatively frequent occurrence of the arbuscular mycorrhizae in the initial <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession,</b> the qualitative properties of the colonization indicated a low effectiveness of symbiosis.

The high APX levels of A. giraldii and A. sacrorum suggested that a high constitutive APX activity was essential for Artemisia survival during the middle or later <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> of abandoned land, too. The increase in APX activity induced under drought in A. scoparia leaves illustrated that efficient regulation of APX activity was important for A. scoparia growth {{in the early stages}} of succession on abandoned land. By contrast, the poor regulation of APX activity in A. annua leaves results in its poor survival on abandoned land. On the other hand, the increased POX activity in A. scoparia and A. giraldii, as well as the decreased POX activity in A. sacrorum (25  %) and A. annua (39  %), seem to associate with their types of leaf cells (Fig.  9 b, d).

Observations were conducted in unmanaged Molinietum caeruleae meadows situated along the successional gradient. The patch representing the initial <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> (P 1) was dominated by small species creating delicate erect or procumbent stems, the patch representing the temporary <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> (P 2) was prevailed by large-tussock grasses and tall-growing macroforbs, while the patch representing the terminal <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession</b> (P 3) was partly overgrown by bushes and trees. The number of generative shoots, flowers, fruits and seeds of Dianthus superbus L. diminished gradually from P 3 via P 2 to P 1. The increase in abundance of generative shoots and flower number in the vicinity of tall plants contributes to increased visibility of inflorescences and may enhance the chances for nocturnal pollinator visits. A significant production of fruits and seeds in competitive neighborhood may augment the chances for successful dispersal and colonization of new, perhaps more favorable habitats. The recruitment of seedlings occurred only in artificially created gaps in plant canopy and litter. The appearance of seedlings and their survivorship were better in P 1 than in P 2 and P 3. Such a phenomenon might be due to the locally rising water level and the diminishing amount of light reaching to the soil area along the successional gradient. 			 			Concluding, it should be asserted that a low production of generative shoots, flowers, fruits and seeds by the population of Dianthus superbus L. established in the patch dominated by small meadow species is compensated by the highest seedling recruitment and their survival. On the other hand, a substantial production of generative structures is not sufficient to ensure the persistence of populations in meadows in advanced stages of secondary succession...|$|E

Plant species cover and several soil-biological parameters (soil microbial biomass, basal soil respiration, exchangeable pH(KCl), organic-C extractable by potassium sulfate solution, and nitrate-N content) were measured once a year. Obtained data were mainly processed by unimodal (plant cover data) and liner (soil-biological data) ordination methods. Biological species traits (life span, seed dispersal vector, seed bank type, ecological strategy type following Grime, life form following Raunkiaer) were used to characterize early <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> plant <b>succession.</b> Vegetation and measured soil-biological parameters, except pH(KCl), were significantly changing during four growing seasons. Variance partitioning analysis based on plant species cover data indicated the landscape type {{to be the main}} governing factor and physico-chemical characteristics of substrate to be less important during the studied initial <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>succession.</b> The same analysis based on soil-biological parameters showed the reverse result. Great variability of plant species ecological traits was noticed during four growing seasons. The earliest plant colonizers were mainly ruderal, anemochorous terophytes with persistent seed bank.

The relationship between the average plant species cover and measured soil-biological parameters was also examined during the experimental study <b>of</b> early <b>succession.</b> Direct and indirect ordination revealed the average sum of plant species cover to be weakly positively correlated with soil microbial biomass, basal soil respiration, nitrate-N, potassium sulfate extractable organic-C, metabolic quocient (qCO 2) and negatively correlated to exchangeable pH(KCl).
