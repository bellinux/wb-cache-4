5|$|After the Seven Years' War, Zieten {{retired from}} active service, widely {{considered}} a hero. During the War of the Bavarian Succession, Frederick forbade him to go, so {{he stayed on}} his estate at Wustrau with his niece, Johanna von Blumenthal, whose son was serving in his regiment. During this period <b>she</b> <b>gathered</b> his reminiscences for a biography.|$|E
5|$|On {{the voyage}} across the Atlantic, Bryant interviewed ambulance-service troops {{and others on}} board the Espagne and wrote news stories about them and about the threat of torpedo attacks.

5|$|Noether {{showed a}} devotion to her subject and her {{students}} that extended beyond the academic day. Once, when {{the building was}} closed for a state holiday, <b>she</b> <b>gathered</b> the class on the steps outside, led them through the woods, and lectured at a local coffee house. Later, after she had been dismissed by the Third Reich, she invited students into her home to discuss their {{plans for the future}} and mathematical concepts.|$|E

5|$|Returning to New York on 13 June 1892, Concord {{made another}} cruise to the West Indies late that year, and arrived back at Norfolk, Virginia, on 5 December. She participated in International Naval Review held at Norfolk and New York in March and April 1893, and in June sailed from Norfolk for the Far East, calling at the Azores, Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said, Bangkok, and Saigon before {{arriving}} at Hong Kong on 30 October. She cruised on the Asiatic Station until 29 May 1894 {{when she arrived}} at Unalaska. She cruised on sealing patrol in the North Pacific {{to carry out the}} provisions of the treaty between the United States and United Kingdom, which empowered Concord to seize any vessel violating the laws protecting valuable fur seals. <b>She</b> <b>gathered</b> hydrographic information to correct Bering Sea charts and conduct scientific observations of the fur seals.|$|E

25|$|Historically the {{narcissus}} {{has appeared}} in written and visual arts since antiquity, being found in graves from Ancient Egypt. In classical Graeco-Roman literature the narcissus is associated with both {{the myth of the}} youth who was turned into a flower of that time, and with the Goddess Persephone, snatched into the underworld as <b>she</b> <b>gathered</b> their blooms. Narcissi were said to grow in meadows in the underworld. In these contexts they frequently appear in the poetry of the period from Stasinos to Pliny.|$|E

25|$|Slave voyage #1: Thomas Nuttall {{received}} a letter of marque on 17 January 1804. She sailed in February in company with Laurel and Urania. They were out {{only a few days}} when they encountered a French warship. Although they took some casualties, they were able to escape. A database of slave voyages by Liverpool-based vessels shows Kitty Amelia, Nuttall, master, sailing to Cuba, though it does not specify where <b>she</b> <b>gathered</b> her human cargo. Kitty's Amelia was back in Liverpool by October, having returned from Havana with a cargo of sugar, cowhides, and cotton.|$|E
25|$|In 1782, {{a native}} army along with British {{soldiers}} attempted to take Fort Henry. During this siege, Fort Henry's supply of ammunition was exhausted. The defenders decided to dispatch {{a man to}} secure more ammunition from the Zane homestead. Betty Zane volunteered for the dangerous task. During her departing run, she was heckled by both native and British soldiers. After reaching the Zane homestead, <b>she</b> <b>gathered</b> a tablecloth and filled it with gunpowder. During her return, she was fired upon but was uninjured. As {{a result of her}} heroism, Fort Henry remained in American control.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Henry took a {{force to}} Winchester where he laid siege to the royal castle which was garrisoned by Angevins. Winchester's royal castle was located on the {{southwest}} side of the city, while an episcopal castle was on the southeast side. Only two other English cities at the time {{had more than one}} castle, London with three and York with two. When she heard of the bishop's incursion Empress Matilda determined to strike back. <b>She</b> <b>gathered</b> an army of her adherents and sortied from her base at Oxford around 28 July 1141. When the empress appeared before Winchester on 31 July it was a complete surprise. Bishop Henry fled the city while his soldiers retreated to Wolvesey Castle, the one belonging to the church.|$|E

25|$|Margarete Sommer {{had been}} sacked from her welfare {{institute}} {{for refusing to}} teach the Nazi line on sterilization. In 1935, she took up a position at the Episcopal Diocesan Authority in Berlin, counselling victims of racial persecution for Caritas Emergency Relief. In 1941 she became director of the Welfare Office of the Berlin Diocesan Authority, under Bernhard Lichtenberg. Following Lichtenberg's arrest, Sommer reported to Bishop Konrad von Preysing. While working for the Welfare Office, Sommer coordinated Catholic aid for victims of racial persecution - giving spiritual comfort, food, clothing, and money. <b>She</b> <b>gathered</b> intelligence on the deportations of the Jews, and living conditions in concentration camps, {{as well as on}} SS firing squads, writing several reports on these topics from 1942, including an August 1942 report which reached Rome under the title “Report on the Exodus of the Jews”.|$|E
25|$|Fish Hawks {{capabilities}} {{launched a}} new era in both fisheries research and fish culture. Her first assignment was to investigate a previously unknown fish, the tilefish, which a commercial fisherman had brought to the Fish Commission station in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 1879. During 1880, operating out of Newport, Rhode Island, she made four voyages to dredge the edge of the continental shelf, during which <b>she</b> <b>gathered</b> data establishing the range and quantity of the tilefish, which later would become an important fishery. Such were her scientific capabilities that she also discovered 40 new species of mollusk and 20 new species of fishes during the four voyages. With the four voyages completed, she returned to Wilmington to have her hatching cones installed so that she could begin her first hatchery work with shad eggs off the southeast coast of the United States by about March 1881.|$|E
25|$|Dillinger and Van Meter resided at Probasco's {{home until}} {{the last week of}} June 1934; that on some {{occasions}} they would be away for a day or two, sometimes leaving separately, and on other occasions together; that at this time Van Meter usually parked his car in the rear of Probasco's residence outside the back fence; that <b>she</b> <b>gathered</b> that Dillinger was keeping company with a young woman who lived {{on the north side of}} Chicago, inasmuch as he would state upon leaving Probasco's home that he was going in the direction of Diversey Boulevard; that Van Meter apparently was not acquainted with Dillinger's friend, and she heard him warning Dillinger to be careful about striking up acquaintances with girls he knew nothing about; that Dillinger and Van Meter usually kept a machine gun in an open case under the piano in the parlor; that they also kept a shotgun under the parlor table.|$|E

25|$|After her husband’s death, Burney {{moved to}} London to be nearer to her son, {{who was a}} fellow at Christ's College. In homage to her father <b>she</b> <b>gathered</b> and in 1832 published, in three volumes, the Memoirs of Doctor Burney. The memoirs were written in a panegyric style, praising her father's accomplishments and character, and she cannibalised many of her own {{personal}} writings from years before to produce them. Always protective of her father and the family's reputation, she deliberately destroyed evidence of facts that were painful or unflattering, and was soundly criticised by her contemporaries and later by historians for doing so. Otherwise, she lived essentially in retirement, outliving her son, who died in 1837, and her sister Charlotte Broome, who died in 1838. While in Bath, Burney received visits from younger members of the Burney family, who found her a fascinating storyteller with a talent for imitating the personalities that she described. She continued to write often to members of her family.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1941, {{she and her}} entourage went to the French {{colonies in}} North Africa. The stated reason was Baker's health (since she was {{recovering}} from another case of pneumonia) but the real reason was to continue helping the Resistance. From a base in Morocco, she made tours of Spain. She pinned notes with the information <b>she</b> <b>gathered</b> inside her underwear (counting on her celebrity to avoid a strip search). She met the Pasha of Marrakech, whose support helped her through a miscarriage (the last of several). After the miscarriage, she developed an infection so severe it required a hysterectomy. The infection spread and she developed peritonitis and then septicemia. After her recovery (which she continued to fall in and out of), she started touring to entertain British, French, and American soldiers in North Africa. The Free French had no organized entertainment network for their troops, so Baker and her entourage managed {{for the most part}} on their own. They allowed no civilians and charged no admission.|$|E
25|$|Sayyida al-Hurra was {{a female}} Muslim cleric, merchant, {{governor}} of Tétouan, and later queen of Morocco. She was born around 1485 in the Emirate of Granada, but was forced to flee to Morocco when she was very young to escape the Reconquista. In Morocco, <b>she</b> <b>gathered</b> a crew largely of exiled Moors, and launched pirate expeditions against Spain and Portugal to avenge the Reconquista, protect Morocco from Christian pirates, and seek riches and glory. She co-founded the Barbary Corsairs with her allies the Barbarossa brothers, who divided the Mediterranean between them—the Barbarossas and their Ottoman fleet operating in the east, and Sayyida al-Hurra and her Moorish and North-African pirates operating in the west. Sayyida al-Hurra became wealthy and renowned enough for the Sultan of Morocco, Ahmad al-Wattasi to make her his queen. Notably, however, she refused to marry in his capital of Fez, and would not get married but in Tétouan, of which she was governor. This {{was the first and}} only time in history that a Moroccan monarch had married away from his capital.|$|E
