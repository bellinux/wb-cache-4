5|$|Maeser {{included}} the Monitorial System from Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster in his teacher training courses. This system suggested that more advanced students monitored the less advanced students {{and that the}} layout of a classroom should allow one teacher to oversee {{a large number of}} students. Maeser believed that this system was flawed, however, because it focused on developing efficiency and disregarded individuality. Maeser argued that the teacher have more personal interactions with students. He implemented his monitorial organization so that each <b>student</b> <b>would</b> be responsible for something or someone else. Students were forced to look outside themselves, creating responsibility and organization.|$|E
5|$|Central to Gray's was {{the system}} shared across the Inns of Court of {{progress}} towards {{a call to}} the Bar, which lasted approximately 12 to 14 years. A <b>student</b> <b>would</b> first study at either Oxford or Cambridge University, or at one of the Inns of Chancery, which were dedicated legal training institutions. If he studied at Oxford or Cambridge he would spend three years working towards a degree, and be admitted to one of the Inns of Court after graduation. If he studied at one of the Inns of Chancery he would do so for one year before seeking admission to the Inn of Court to which his Inn of Chancery was tied—in the case of Gray's Inn, the attached Inns of Chancery were Staple Inn and Barnard's Inn.|$|E
5|$|For several centuries, {{education}} {{at one of}} the Inns of Chancery was the first step towards becoming a barrister. A <b>student</b> <b>would</b> first join one of the Inns of Chancery, where he would be taught in the form of moots and rote learning. He would also be taught by Readers sent from the Inn of Court that his Inn of Chancery was attached to, who would preside over the moots and discuss cases with the students. At the end of each legal term, particularly promising students would be transferred to the parent Inn of Court and begin the next stage of their education. By 1461 there were approximately 100 students studying at the Inns of Chancery at any one time.|$|E
50|$|All USPSA <b>students</b> <b>would</b> be {{required}} to spend {{a period of time}} studying abroad. <b>Students</b> <b>would</b> {{be required}} to take courses in foreign languages and international relations. <b>Students</b> <b>would</b> spend eight weeks each summer participating in structured learning programs, such as emergency response training, civilian internship in the armed forces, and an internship with a public agency.|$|R
50|$|Once admitted, <b>students</b> <b>would</b> earn credits {{toward a}} Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree. <b>Students</b> <b>would</b> be {{required}} to choose a public service concentration {{in the field in}} which they ultimately will serve post-graduation.|$|R

5|$|All of the {{children}} attended the nearby George Street State School {{and one by one}} the brothers joined the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens. The club had a program whereby they gave a medal for every local school to award to the best cricketer in their ranks in that year. The successful <b>student</b> <b>would</b> then be given access to all of the club's facilities. All of the Harvey brothers were recipients were of this medal. At Fitzroy, they came under the influence of former Victorian all-rounder Arthur Liddicut and the club's veteran captain Joe Plant. The Harveys had no formal coaching, and their father, although a regular presence at the club, chose to stay in the background as their respective careers developed. Horace did not advise his sons on how to bat, allowing them to formulate their own style and technique. According to the Harvey brothers, it was their mother who was vocal and extroverted, in contrast to their reserved father. The boys who failed to score runs were given kitchen duty and according to them, their parents never showed favouritism.|$|E
25|$|The {{score is}} {{calculated}} {{based on a}} bell curve. For example, if many do well in a paper, there is a potential reduction of the raw score and vice versa, despite differences in performances each year. For example, an average <b>student</b> <b>would</b> get a score of 210+ if he/she scored 3 low As and a high B. A highly proficient <b>student</b> <b>would</b> easily get a score of 250 and above if they scored 2 or 3 A*s and high As.|$|E
25|$|Lessons {{were held}} {{throughout}} the school, however each form had an allocated form room in either St. Helen's House or B Block. Every <b>student</b> <b>would</b> have {{a desk in}} the form room, where he could keep his books; however, around 1949 lockers started to be provided {{on the ground floor}} of B Block.|$|E
50|$|Secondary 1 to Secondary 3 {{students}} were offered {{a broad and}} balanced curriculum, focusing on languages, liberal arts, business and science.

50|$|On Wednesdays, however, {{things are}} set up differently. On Wednesdays, there is a {{shortened}} schedule. As <b>students</b> <b>would</b> normally be out of school at 3:40pm, on Wednesdays <b>students</b> <b>would</b> be out at 2:55pm. There is no SRT on this day, and classes are only an average of forty-five minutes. Lunch runs the same way on this day; but, rather than leaving after SRT, the <b>students</b> <b>would</b> leave to their next destination right after their third period.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{announced}} {{the bill would}} {{reduce the number of}} members in the administration council from more than 60 to 20.

25|$|In 2003, Downside was {{the setting}} for a {{television}} show A Second Chance, in which a teenager from London, Ryan Bell, was sent to Downside {{to see if a}} 'difficult' <b>student</b> <b>would</b> do better in the independent sector. After excelling at Latin, biology, and on the rugby field, Bell was eventually expelled after being caught drinking.|$|E
25|$|The {{windows that}} faced {{the street in}} the study hall were never opened in order to prevent distractions. A noise was once heard outside the study hall.

25|$|Traditionally, {{the bulk}} of the study of {{calligraphy}} is composed of copying strictly exemplary works from the apprentice's master or from reputed calligraphers, thus learning them by rote. The master showing the 'right way' to draw items, which the apprentice have to copy strictly, continuously, until the move becomes instinctive and the copy perfect. Deviation from the model is seen as a failure. Competency in a particular style often requires many years of practice. Correct strokes, stroke order, character structure, balance, and rhythm are essential in calligraphy. A <b>student</b> <b>would</b> also develop their skills in traditional Chinese arts, as familiarity and ability in the arts contributes to their calligraphy.|$|E
50|$|The {{fountain}} was sculpted by Christian Petersen in 1941 after {{a request}} from Iowa State President Charles Friley.

25|$|The Asahi Shimbun cites {{an example}} of a {{contract}} for 100 lessons, which would cost 230,000 yen in advance, for a per-lesson fee of 2,300 yen. A contract for 600 lessons would require an advance payment of 720,000 yen, or 1,200 yen per class. But if a person with a contract for 600 lessons canceled after taking only 100 classes, Nova would apply the fee of 2,300 yen per lesson, and the <b>student</b> <b>would</b> receive a refund of 490,000 yen. Such students say the contract for 1,200 yen per lesson should have applied in these cases, which would result in a refund of 600,000 yen.|$|E
25|$|The Friend of Singa Award was {{the brain}} child of Vincent Lam, {{a member of}} the Singapore Courtesy Council in 1991 as a means to {{recognise}} courteous conduct by students, and to function symbiotically with the school's efforts to teach courteous behaviour within students as well. It was established with the hope that other students would see winners of the Friend of Singa Award as role models, and follow the example set by them as well. The award, opened to any school in Singapore, involved the nomination of a student from each school by recounting the respective student's act of kindness and courtesy. Among all the nominations, a <b>student</b> <b>would</b> then be chosen for the Most Courteous Student Award and 10 other students for Merit Awards.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the Guru {{would live}} a simple married life, and accept shishya (student, Sanskrit: शिष्य) where he lived. A person would begin {{a life of}} study in the Gurukula (the {{household}} of the Guru). The process of acceptance included proffering firewood and sometimes {{a gift to the}} guru, signifying that the student wants to live with, work and help the guru in maintaining the gurukul, and as an expression of a desire for education in return over several years. At the Gurukul, the working <b>student</b> <b>would</b> study the basic traditional vedic sciences and various practical skills-oriented sastras along with the religious texts contained within the Vedas and Upanishads. The education stage of a youth with a guru was referred to as Brahmacharya, and in some parts of India this followed the Upanayana or Vidyarambha rites of passage.|$|E

25|$|Similar in {{use to the}} grimoires of {{ceremonial}} magicians, the Book contained {{instructions for}} how to perform rituals and spells, as well as religious poetry and chants like Eko Eko Azarak to use in those rituals. Gardner's original intention was that every copy of the Book would be different, because a <b>student</b> <b>would</b> copy from their initiators, but changing things which they felt to be personally ineffective, however amongst many Gardnerian Witches today, particularly in the United States, all copies of the Book are kept identical to the version that the High Priestess Monique Wilson copied from Gardner, with nothing being altered. The Book of Shadows was originally meant to be kept a secret from non-initiates into BTW, but parts of the Book have been published by authors including Charles Cardell, Lady Sheba, Janet Farrar and Stewart Farrar.|$|E
25|$|OBE can be {{compared}} across different institutions. On an individual level, institutions can look at what outcomes a student has achieved to decide what level the <b>student</b> <b>would</b> be at within a new institution. On an institutional level, institutions can compare themselves, by checking to see what outcomes they have in common, and find places where they may need improvement, based on the achievement of outcomes at other institutions. The ability to compare easily across institutions allows students to move between institutions with relative ease. The institutions can compare outcomes to determine what credits to award the student. The clearly articulated outcomes should allow institutions to assess the student’s achievements rapidly, leading to increased movement of students. These outcomes also work for school to work transitions. A potential employer can look at records of the potential employee to determine what outcomes they have achieved. They can then determine if the potential employee has the skills necessary for the job.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Gordon instituted various innovations, {{which were}} cause for a rapid {{increase}} in the student body. Among them were designating lectures for specific student levels. Whereas other contemporary yeshivas provided one level of study for all students, Telz provided students with lectures commensurate with a student's age and understanding. When a student's standard had advanced, he would advance to the next shiur (class-level). The benefits of such a system are self-explanatory and this system was soon integrated into the structure of almost all yeshivas and remains the accepted structure in most yeshivas worldwide. There were five different shiurim at Telz; Rabbi Gordon delivered the highest shiur. Telz was especially noted {{for its ability to}} develop its talmidim in lomdus. Rabbi Laizer Yudel Finkel once stated that every talmud <b>student</b> <b>would</b> be best off studying at Telz, where he can develop his learning skills, for two years, and then studying in another yeshiva.|$|E

Noted Sinologist Hellmut Wilhelm claims even though the display of grief was genuine, it was also a way of emulating the stories of his heroic idols and [...] " [...] in the public eye". Yue's father later followed him secretly to Zhou's tomb after striking him during an argument over his melancholic behavior. There, he saw him perform the unorthodox obediences involving the meat, wine, and three arrows. When he finally confronted him, the son confessed that [...] "his gratitude for Chou's instruction could not be requited simply by the usual first and middle of the month ceremonies and so he... shot off the three arrows to symbolize that Chou had been the source of his inspiration as an archer". Dr. Kaplan's states this happened just prior to Yue's entrance into the army and that the entire event served as a symbol for Yue's [...] "entrance into responsible manhood".|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{advantages}} of involving students in scientific research have been well-documented. Many educational organisations {{and universities have}} placed emphasis on integrating scientific research into the undergraduate curriculum. Aims: The objective {{of this paper is}} to elaborate on the importance of integrating scientific research into the undergraduate curriculum and to propose a model on how to integrate it into the current curriculums. Methods: In this proposed model, <b>students</b> <b>would</b> be exposed to research in each academic year from the 1 st year up to the 5 th year. In the 1 st year, <b>students</b> <b>would</b> attend lectures introducing them to scientific research. In the 2 nd year, <b>students</b> <b>would</b> be distributed among the faculty members and would be exposed to a more detailed research science by having lectures that explain research problems, and the objectives of the study. In the 3 rd year, <b>students</b> <b>would</b> have detailed lectures about study designs and how to write one. In the 4 th year, <b>students</b> <b>would</b> have lectures about biostatistics, in addition to, lectures that explain how to write the 'Results' section of their study in a manuscript format; then they would be trained to conduct the study and collect pertaining data. In the 5 th year, <b>students</b> <b>would</b> have lectures on the components of the 'Discussion' and 'Conclusion' sections as well as how to write them appropriately in a manuscript format. Finally, they would be taught on how to finalize editing of their research manuscript in preparation for publication. In the internship programme, they would be obligated to conduct another study independently, in order to evaluate their understanding. Conclusion: The undergraduate research is a cumulative learning experience which requires the support of the institute and faculty. Establishing a dental <b>student</b> research journal <b>would</b> encourage <b>students</b> to conduct and publish their research...|$|R
