40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} the number of informed traders in a financial asset and the estimated adverse <b>selection</b> <b>cost</b> of trading in that asset, lambda, after controlling for the effects of previously identified determinants of market liquidity. As a proxy for informed traders, we use dual traders in futures markets - i. e., floor traders who trade both for customers and their own accounts on the same day. We show, theoretically, that it is optimal for dual traders to mimic both the size and direction of their informed customers' orders. Using data from four selected futures contracts we show that the number of dual traders in a contract is indeed a significant determinant of the adverse <b>selection</b> <b>cost</b> of trading in that contract. We also examine how the adverse <b>selection</b> <b>cost</b> of trading changes with the number of competing dual traders in an asset m. Our model demonstrates the existence of a non-monotonic relationship between lambda and m. Specifically, for securities with relatively small numbers of dual traders, there is a positive relationship between lambda and m. For securities with relatively large number of dual traders, there is a negative relationship between lambda and m. Our data indicates a strong support for the non-monotonic relationship between lambda and m. A practical implication of our results is that an observable variable such as the number of broker-dealers in the market can provide an accurate estimation of the adverse <b>selection</b> <b>cost</b> of trading in that market.

40|$|We examine adverse {{selection}} costs around NYSE decimalization. Further, we analyze {{the relation between}} {{adverse selection}} costs and trade size. We find {{a significant increase in}} the percentage adverse <b>selection</b> <b>cost</b> and a reduction in dollar adverse <b>selection</b> <b>cost</b> (percentage adverse selection multiplied by the spread) following complete decimalization on the NYSE. On estimating the adverse selection components by trade size classes, we find a decline in dollar adverse selection costs in trades of all sizes, with the strongest evidence coming from medium size trades, followed by small and large size trades. One implication of our findings is that there appears to be less stealth trading following complete decimalization and less institutional trading overall.

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of management earnings forecasts on the level of information asymmetry around subsequent earnings announcement. Design/methodology/approach – Employing the adverse <b>selection</b> <b>cost</b> method suggested by George et al., the paper compares for each sample firm the adverse <b>selection</b> <b>cost</b> around earnings announcement in forecasting years with that in non-forecasting years. Findings – Consistent with Diamond and Verrecchia is the finding that the earnings announcement in non-forecasting years decreases information asymmetry during a three-day announcement period and increases in a post-announcement period up to seven days. No significant change in information asymmetry between pre- and post-announcement periods when firms released a “good” news forecast is found. The firms that previously released a “bad” news forecast experience a significantly lower information asymmetry than those that did not forecast during announcement or post-announcement days, and experience a decrease in information asymmetry in a five to seven-day post-announcement period. Originality/value – This paper provides the first empirical reports on the different information asymmetry changes around earnings announcements followed by a “good” news management forecast from those followed by a “bad” news forecast.

40|$|The need to {{understand}} and measure the determinants of market maker bid/ask spreads is crucial in evaluating the merits of competing market structures and the faimess of market maker rents. This study develops a simple, parsimonious model for the market maker's spread that accounts {{for the effects of}} price discreteness induced by minimum tick size, order-processing costs, inventory-holding costs, adverse selection, and competition. The inventory-holding and adverse <b>selection</b> <b>cost</b> components of spread are modeled as an option with a stochastic time to expiration. This inventory-holding premium embedded in the spread represents compensation for the price risk bome by the market maker while the security is held in inventory. The premium is partitioned {{in such a way that}} the inventoryholding and adverse <b>selection</b> <b>cost</b> components, as well as the probability of an informed trade, are identified.

40|$|Based on a {{structural}} model we analyze adverse <b>selection</b> <b>costs</b> and liquidity supply in a pure open limit order book market. Given the discontenting empirical model performance {{reported in the}} previous literature, we relax restrictive assumptions of the underlying theoretical model concerning order book equilibrium {{and the distribution of}} market order volumes. We demonstrate that the resulting revised econometric methodology delivers considerably improved empirical results. Employing the alternative approach in a cross sectional analysis we provide evidence that adverse <b>selection</b> <b>costs</b> are more severe for smaller capitalized stocks, and find empirical support for one of the main hypothesis put forth by the theory of limit order book markets, which states that liquidity supply and adverse <b>selection</b> <b>costs</b> are inversely related. We also show that adverse selection component estimates based on the formal model and those obtained using popular model-free methods are closely correlated. This result indicates the robustness of the structural model, but also provides a theoretical underpinning for the application of the ad hoc method to limit order book data...|$|R

40|$|The adverse {{selection}} problem in finance is well documented. More precisely, a dealer widens the bid-ask spread when trading {{with someone who}} likely possesses superior knowledge. A higher cost of trading discourages uninformed traders from market participation. This motivates the dealer to widen the bid-ask spread even further, since disproportionately more informed traders remain. Knowing whether analysts and institutional owners help to mitigate the 2 ̆ 2 {{adverse selection}} problem 2 ̆ 2 is important to practitioners and scholars alike. If true that analysts and institutions are effective monitors of a firm, then private information is less available to traders and the adverse <b>selection</b> <b>cost</b> is kept low. Investors and financial managers benefit accordingly. ^ The purpose of this dissertation is to test whether the adverse selection component is lower for firms which are widely followed by analysts and heavily owned by institutions (institutional favorites) and higher for firms which are virtually ignored by analysts and institutions (neglected firms). This research extends previous work {{in the areas of}} both firm monitoring and market microstructure and offers the unique contribution of concurrently evaluating the adverse selection problem for both institutional favorites and neglected firms. ^ Findings for institutional favorites confirm prior research that attention paid to a firm by analysts and institutions helps to reduce the adverse <b>selection</b> <b>cost</b> of trading. No evidence is found that the adverse <b>selection</b> <b>cost</b> of trading is higher for neglected firms vis-a-vis control group firms, similar in size and SIC Code. This result is compatible with the research which suggests that the stringent listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange enhance a firm 2 ̆ 7 s visibility, {{even in the absence of}} attention from analysts and institutions. ^ Results for firms, regardless of visibility level, reveal a higher adverse <b>selection</b> <b>cost</b> of trading around the opening of the market. This is consistent with extant literature that suggests that informed trading occurs early in the day as people are anxious to take advantage of news which accumulates throughout the night. ^ Future research might examine institutional favorites and neglected firms trading in markets other than the New York Stock Exchange or for a different period of time. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of the {{introduction}} of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the liquidity of individual stocks. Prior analytical studies suggest that uninformed investors strictly prefer trading ETFs to trading individual stocks in order to avoid trading against informed investors. As a result of uninformed investors ’ migration, the markets for individual stocks are predicted to become illiquid as ETFs become widely available. Using ETF trading and holdings data between 2002 and 2008, I test the hypothesis that the higher the percentage of a firm’s shares held by ETFs, the higher the adverse <b>selection</b> <b>cost</b> to trade the firm’s stock. I find that the availability of ETFs as an alternative trading option is positively associated with the adverse selection component of bid-ask spreads of stocks in ETFs. The positive association is shown to be stronger with ETFs holding more diversified portfolios of stocks, as uninformed investors ’ incentives to switch are stronger for more diversified ETFs. The increase in the adverse selection costs of individual stocks is transferred to the ETF-level adverse selection costs, and diversified ETFs are especially shown to suffer from illiquidity of their underlying stocks. This dynamics between stock-level and ETF-level adverse selection casts a doubt whether uninformed investors can avoid the adverse <b>selection</b> <b>cost</b> by trading ETFs as effectively a...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} role of adverse <b>selection</b> <b>costs</b> in times of high debt issue volume, or the hot debt market. Following the pecking order theory of capital structure, I hypothesize that high {{information}} asymmetry between investors and managers hinders companies from issuing equity and, instead, prompts firms to time their debt issues to that point of time. I also examine whether the phenomenon is more pronounced for the private debt market and whether evidence of timing attempt {{can be found in the}} issue size and use of proceeds of hot debt issues. DATA The empirical analysis conducted in this study is based on comprehensive data of debt issues by listed non-financial companies in the U. S. market in 1999 - 2009. The data are collected from SDC Platinum. The final sample of debt issues consists of 1, 527 public debt issues, 814 private debt issues and 4, 408 issues of syndicated loans. I also utilize Thomson ONE Banker for issuers’ financial and stock price data, I/B/E/S for analyst forecast data and DataStream for macroeconomic variables. RESULTS The results from the empirical analysis, based on ordinary least squares regressions method, lead to a conclusion that, in aggregate, adverse <b>selection</b> <b>costs</b> are one factor behind the hot debt market. I also find that the three examined debt markets have behaved in a remarkably divergent way, and while high adverse <b>selection</b> <b>costs</b> are found to drive the debt issue waves of syndicated loans, information asymmetry appears to reduce private debt issuance. Based on larger issue size and changes in balance sheet items of hot debt issuers, I conclude that the behavior of hot debt issuers shows some evidence of market timing. However, the impact of adverse <b>selection</b> <b>costs</b> in issue size and use of proceeds is varying and in many cases statistically weak...|$|R
