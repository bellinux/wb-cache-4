5|$|Albert {{seems to}} have {{received}} Luther's letter with the Theses {{around the end of}} November. He requested the opinion of theologians at the University of Mainz and conferred with his advisers. His advisers recommended he have Luther prohibited from preaching against indulgences in accordance with the indulgence bull. Albert requested such action from the Roman Curia. In Rome, Luther was immediately perceived as a threat. In February 1518, Pope Leo asked the head of the Augustinian Hermits, Luther's religious order, to convince him to stop spreading his ideas about indulgences. Sylvester Mazzolini was also appointed to write an opinion which would be used in the trial against him. Mazzolini wrote A Dialogue against Martin Luther's Presumptuous Theses concerning the Power of the Pope, which focused on Luther's questioning of the pope's authority rather than his complaints about indulgence preaching. Luther received a summons to Rome in August 1518. He responded with Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences, in which he attempted to clear himself of the charge that he was attacking the pope. As he <b>set</b> <b>down</b> <b>his</b> views more extensively, Luther {{seems to have}} recognized that the implications of his beliefs set him further from official teaching than he initially knew. He later said he might not have begun the controversy had he known where it would lead. The Explanations have been called Luther's first Reformation work.|$|E
500|$|At the far right, a {{black man}} fondles the breasts of a woman, distracting her from her work, her {{pie-dish}} [...] "tottering like her virtue". Confusion over whether the law permitted slavery in England, and pressure from abolitionists, meant that by the mid-eighteenth century there was a sizeable population of free black Londoners; but the status of this man is not clear. The black man, the girl and bawling boy fill the roles of Mars, Venus and Cupid which would {{have appeared in the}} pastoral scenes that Hogarth is aping. In front of the couple, a boy has <b>set</b> <b>down</b> <b>his</b> pie to rest, but the plate has broken, spilling the pie onto the ground where it is being rapidly consumed by an urchin. The boy's features are modelled on those of a child in the foreground of Poussin's first version of the Rape of the Sabine Women (now held in the Metropolitan Museum of Art), but the boy crying over his lost pie was apparently sketched by Hogarth after he witnessed the scene one day while he was being shaved.|$|E
2500|$|When Kossuth {{and others}} sought refuge in Turkey after {{the failure of}} the Hungarian {{uprising}} in 1849, the sultan was called on by Austria and Russia to surrender them, but he refused. He also would not allow the conspirators against his own life to be put to death. The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica says of him, [...] "He bore the character of being a kind and honourable man, if somewhat weak and easily led. Against this, however, must be <b>set</b> <b>down</b> <b>his</b> excessive extravagance, especially towards the end of his life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jaspers <b>set</b> <b>down</b> <b>his</b> {{views on}} mental illness {{in a book}} which he {{published}} in 1913, General Psychopathology. This work has become a classic in the psychiatric literature and many modern diagnostic criteria stem from ideas found within it. One of Jaspers's central tenets was that psychiatrists should diagnose symptoms of mental illness (particularly of psychosis) by their form rather than by their content. For example, in diagnosing a hallucination, {{it is more important}} to note that a person experiences visual phenomena when no sensory stimuli account for them, than to note what the patient sees. What the patient sees is the [...] "content", but the discrepancy between visual perception and objective reality is the [...] "form".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{offer any}} wager you like," [...] cried he, <b>setting</b> <b>down</b> <b>his</b> glass so {{forcibly}} as {{to break the}} stem of it, [...] "that this very evening I find out {{the mystery of the}} Veiled Lady!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Give me the note," [...] he snapped. <b>Setting</b> <b>down</b> <b>his</b> pen, {{he thrust}} out an unclean paw to snatch the folded sheet from Simonne's hand. He spread it, and read, his bloodless lips compressed, his eyes {{narrowing}} to slits.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well done! splendidly done!" [...] {{cried the}} boy, <b>setting</b> <b>down</b> <b>his</b> pot. [...] "Arrah!
