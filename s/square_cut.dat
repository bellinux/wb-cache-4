5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite <b>square</b> <b>cut</b> shot.|$|E
5|$|Upon Bradman's dismissal, {{dark clouds}} began {{to close in}} on the ground, and rain {{appeared}} to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came, and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes. The pair attacked, Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries, and later pulling another ball in the air for another four. Barnes gave Young an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. The pair reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries, having been prolific on the <b>square</b> <b>cut.</b> He tied the scores with a swept boundary, and having taken a stump as souvenir, ran off the ground believing the match was over. Barnes tossed his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and Hassett promptly hit the winning run.|$|E
5|$|England were {{eventually}} out for 441 {{on the final}} day, leaving Australia a target of 98. Bradman’s men progressed quickly {{at the start of}} the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, including three boundaries, whereas Morris again lacked fluency. However, Barnes continued to score quickly, and 24 runs came from the first four overs. The tourists proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell for nine. Bradman came to the crease and fell for a duck after 12 minutes in the middle. This left Australia at 2/48; dark clouds began to close in on the ground, and rain appeared to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came; Lindsay Hassett joined Barnes and they took the tourists to the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes gave Jack Young an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. Barnes tied the scores with a swept boundary and ran off the field with a souvenir stump, believing the match was over. He tossed his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and realising his mistake; Hassett proceeded to hit the winning run. Barnes ended unbeaten on 64 with 11 boundaries; he scored prolifically with his <b>square</b> <b>cut.</b> The next morning, he perused all of the newspapers, expecting to be heavily rebuked by analysts for reckless batting on the final day, but they instead focused on his captain's failure to score.|$|E

25|$|Although confusingly named a drive, {{the square}} drive is {{actually}} a horizontal bat shot, with identical arm mechanics {{to that of the}} <b>square</b> <b>cut.</b> The difference between the cut and the square drive is the height of the ball at contact: the cut is played to a ball bouncing waist high or above with the batsman standing tall, whereas the square drive is played to a wide ball of shin height with the batsman bending his knees and crouching low to make contact.|$|E
25|$|South Africa. However, {{this was}} not enough to ensure his {{selection}} in the First Test, where he was made 12th man. After scoring 60 and 37 and taking 1/60 in an Australian XI against the South Africans following the Test, he was selected for the Second Test. He suffered a smashed gum and a severely cut top lip when a <b>square</b> <b>cut</b> by John Waite in the Third Test against South Africa at the Sydney Cricket Ground hit him in the face while he was fielding at short gully.|$|E

25|$|He was, in any case, {{a skilled}} batsman, rarely lifting the ball {{off the surface}} while driving elegantly and adept at accumulating by {{flicking}} the ball off his toes towards fine leg. Preferring to play off the front foot, Pullar was also a good puller of the ball and could crack a <b>square</b> <b>cut.</b> In his younger days he had been compared to Charlie Hallows and Eddie Paynter, two of Lancashire's crowd pleasing greats – he had the artistry of the former and the pugnacious aggression and watchful determination of the latter.|$|E
25|$|According to Neville Cardus, Tyldesley {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} of Lancashire batsmen. Cardus agreed with Wisden that Tyldesley was exceptionally quick on his feet and therefore always seemed to have plenty of time in which to play his strokes. Tyldesley was very strong, despite his small size, with quick reflexes and great flexibility in his wrists which assisted both his strokeplay and, when fielding, his throwing. He was especially noted as a batsman for his mastery of the <b>square</b> <b>cut</b> and his fighting qualities in difficult conditions; he played many noted innings on bad wickets.|$|E
25|$|Australia won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a pitch {{offering}} some moisture and grass {{on the first}} morning, but predicted {{to be a good}} batting track for days two to three and slowly develop into a spinner's track by day five. After bowling a maiden to start the day, R. P. Singh dismissed Jaques, who was trying to <b>square</b> <b>cut</b> uppishly on the back foot, for a duck. In the ninth over of the day Hayden edged Singh {{to the left of the}} wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who was off balance and left the catch to first slip Tendulkar. Australia were 2/27 with Ponting and Hussey at the crease.|$|E

50|$|The {{exhibition}} was originally scheduled to close on 9 September, but was extended {{for one week}} and finally closed on 16 September 2012. The field was lowered and dismantled after the exhibition.Disassembly took {{only a little more}} than a week. Most of the material was to be recycled, but 50 <b>squares</b> <b>cut</b> from the epoxy surface were offered to the public at a price of EUR 250 per piece.|$|R
50|$|Because the {{material}} to be cut is non-fibrous, there is much less chance of kickback. Therefore, the most-used method of cutting is plunge-cutting, by pushing {{the tip of the}} blade into {{the material}}. With this method <b>square</b> <b>cuts</b> as small as the blade width can be achieved. Pushback can occur if a block shifts when nearly cut through and pinches the blade, but overall the machine is less dangerous than a wood-cutting chainsaw.|$|R
25|$|After {{designing}} the un-built Ro I twin-engined flying boat, Rohrbach developed the Rohrbach Ro II flying boat as an all-metal shoulder winged monoplane flying boat with two tractor engines mounted in nacelles, above the wings, on struts. Planforms and profiles were kept {{as simple as}} possible with rectangular section fuselage frames (with vee planing bottoms), constant chord wings, tailplane and fin with <b>square</b> <b>cut</b> tips and distinctive protruding servo/trim/balance tabs at wing and fin tips. The two-seat open cockpit sat between the engines at the wing leading edge, with an open gunner/bosun's position at the extreme nose. A very unusual feature of several of Rohrbach's flying-boats was the provision of a pair of masts and sails to be rigged in the event of engine failure to allow the aircraft to be sailed back to safety.|$|E
25|$|Australia's woes on {{the field}} were {{magnified}} by Laxman and Dravid's stubborn partnership on the third day, but their misery was to continue when {{it was discovered that}} one of Australia's bowlers, Brad Williams had injured his shoulder while fielding and that he would require a month to be back in action. The bad day which was to unfold for the Australians began with a <b>square</b> <b>cut</b> from Rahul Dravid on the first ball of the day from Stuart MacGill. He had taken 386 balls for the milestone. After reaching his double hundred, Dravid continue in fine nick, cover driving a ball from Gillespie to extra cover boundary for four, going past Ravi Shastri's record for the highest score in Australia against Australia by an Indian. His monumental innings-it lasted for well over 9 hours-ended when he top-edged a pull off Gillespie to Bichel, who took a good, tumbling catch.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the city}} was divided into four barrios or neighbourhoods: Marfil/Santiago, Tepetapa, Santa Ana and Santa Fe. The last is {{considered}} the oldest {{and is in the}} current colonia of Pastita. The city was split by a small river that serves as a main thoroughfare. Because of the extremely hilly terrain, only one main road enters and another ones leaves. The main street into the city, called Belaunzarán, now runs for three km underground and follows the original course of the Guanajuato River. Unlike the regular layouts of many other Spanish and Mexican cities, the streets of Guanajuato follow the extreme irregularity of the terrain, with small alleyways, plazas and in some cases steep staircases up hillsides. Most are paved with <b>square</b> <b>cut</b> stone, with only a limited number that are passable to cars. Most of the passageways are really alleys with a limited amount of open space in the way of very small plazas, which gives the city a more European flavor than other Mexican cities.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of isolated photons in hadronic Z decays is measured with the ALEPH detector at LEP using {{a sample of}} 450 000 hadronic events.

50|$|Still, {{traditional}} blackface entertainers {{disliked the}} new approach. Lew Dockstader remarked that Primrose and Westhad refined {{all the fun}} out of it.

What is really good is killed by the surroundings.Nevertheless, Primrose and West's approach caught on, and the blackface act continued only with minor troupes and as a regular fixture of vaudeville.|$|R
40|$|A {{search for}} vector-like quarks (VLQs) {{decaying}} to a Z boson using multi-stage machine learning {{was compared to}} a search using a standard <b>square</b> <b>cuts</b> search strategy. VLQs are predicted by several new theories beyond the Standard Model. The searches used 20. 3 inverse femtobarns of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector in 2012 at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. CLs upper limits on production cross sections of vector-like top and bottom quarks were computed for VLQs produced singly or in pairs, Tsingle, Bsingle, Tpair, and Bpair. The two stage machine learning classification search strategy did not provide any improvement over the standard <b>square</b> <b>cuts</b> strategy, but for Tpair, Bpair, and Tsingle, a third stage of machine learning regression was able to lower the upper limits of high signal masses {{by as much as}} 50 %. Additionally, new test statistics were developed for use in the Neyman construction of confidence regions in order to address deficiencies in current frequentist methods, such as the generation of empty set confidence intervals. A new method for treating nuisance parameters was also developed that may provide better coverage properties than current methods used in particle searches. Finally, significance ratio functions were derived that allow a more nuanced interpretation of the evidence provided by measurements than is given by confidence intervals alone...|$|R
25|$|A cut is a cross-batted shot {{played at}} a short-pitched ball, placing it wide on the off side. The batsman makes {{contact with the}} ball as it draws {{alongside}} or passes him and therefore requires virtually no effort on his part as he uses the bowler's pace to divert the ball. A <b>square</b> <b>cut</b> is a shot hit into the off side at near to 90 degrees from the wicket (towards point). A late cut is played as or after the ball passes the batsman's body and is hit towards third man. The cut shot is typically played off the back foot, but is also sometimes played off the front foot against slower bowling. The cut should be played {{with the face of}} the bat rolling over the ball to face the ground thus pushing the ball downwards. A mistimed cut with an open-faced bat (with the face of the bat facing the bowler) will generally lead to the ball rising in the air, giving a chance for the batsman to be caught.|$|E
500|$|Gate to the Northwest Passage is a 1980 {{sculpture}} by Alan Chung Hung, located {{adjacent to the}} Vancouver Maritime Museum in Vanier Park in the Kitsilano neighborhood of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The [...] sculpture of a <b>square,</b> <b>cut</b> and twisted [...] "like a paper clip" [...] to form an arch, is composed of weathered Corten steel that rusts to provide a protective layer. The work was installed in 1980 to commemorate the arrival of Captain George Vancouver in Burrard Inlet, following a competition sponsored by Parks Canada one year prior. Gate to the Northwest Passage received an adverse reaction initially, but reception has improved over time. The sculpture has been included in walking tours of the surrounding neighborhoods as a highlight of Vanier Park.|$|E
500|$|John Arlott called him, [...] "a cricketer {{of effect}} {{rather than the}} graces". An {{animated}} presence at the batting crease, he constantly adjusted his equipment and clothing, and restlessly tapped his bat {{on the ground as}} the bowler ran in. Basing his game on a sound defence learned during many hours of childhood lessons, Chappell employed the drive and <b>square</b> <b>cut</b> to full effect. He had an idiosyncratic method of playing back and across to a ball of full length and driving wide of mid on, but his trademark shot was the hook, famously saying [...] "three bouncers an over should be worth 12 runs to me". A specialist slip fielder, he was the fourth player to take one hundred Test catches.|$|E
