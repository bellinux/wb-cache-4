5|$|As {{a result}} of the inspection, Sir Francis Flemming, the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, was tasked in February 1558 with {{improving}} the defences on the islands. Flemming was <b>supported</b> <b>in</b> this effort with a shipment of lead to aid in construction, and money raised from the dissolution of the monasteries in England. The building work initially focused on the island of Tresco and was carried out under the direction of John Killigrew, the captain of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth. Tresco was in need of modern defences, but Killigrew also wanted to use the work programme to increase his political influence on the island.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare type of housing and <b>support</b> <b>in</b> housing in two groups (people with psychiatric disabilities and people with intellectual disabilities) typically dependent on <b>support</b> <b>in</b> everyday life. A second objective was to examine whether type of housing and <b>support</b> <b>in</b> housing were related to gender within the two groups. Information was obtained by available questionnaire reports provided by staff members. The results indicate unequal accessibility of <b>support</b> <b>in</b> housing in relation to the two groups. Moreover, the findings suggest that type of disability is a more determining factor than gender regarding <b>support</b> <b>in</b> housing. ...|$|R

5|$|There is {{uncertainty}} as {{to whether}} Domnall was <b>supported</b> <b>in</b> his venture {{by the rest of}} the Uí Briain. Although it is possible that he enjoyed backing from Muirchertach himself, the fact that the Annals of the Four Masters states that Muirchertach had Domnall imprisoned three years before could be evidence that Domnall had made his move into the Isles without Muirchertach's consent. The annal-entry concerning Domnall's seizure of the Isles reveals that Domnall launched his campaign from northern Ireland, and a further entry in the same source shows that Dublin was occupied by Muirchertach for about three months, the very year of Domnall's campaign. These records appear to indicate that Domnall was aided in his undertaking in the Isles by Muirchertach's northern opponents, and that Muirchertach occupied the town as means to directly counter Domnall's campaign, and deny him any support from the Dubliners. In fact, Domnall may well have been <b>supported</b> <b>in</b> the Isles by Domnall Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain (died 1121), a northern monarch who was not only Muirchertach's principal rival, but the representative of a family with a long history of involvement in the region.|$|E

Variable-centered and person-centered analyses revealed that perceived social support tends to be similar across relationships and stable over time. Variable-centered analyses indicated that social <b>support</b> <b>in</b> mother-adolescent relationships was uniquely related to adolescent global self-worth; that social <b>support</b> <b>in</b> close friendships was uniquely related to social acceptance, friendship competence, and romantic competence; and that social <b>support</b> <b>in</b> romantic relationships was uniquely related to romantic competence. Person-centered analyses indicated that adolescents who reported high social <b>support</b> <b>in</b> all three relationships had higher selfworth and greater interpersonal competence {{than those who did}} not have a romantic relationship and who reported low social <b>support</b> <b>in</b> relationships with mothers and close friends; and that scores for adolescents who had a romantic relationship but who reported low social <b>support</b> <b>in</b> all three relationships fell in between these two groups. Taken together, variable-centered analyses suggest that different relationships influence different dimensions of competence, but person- centered analyses indicate that a sizable proportion of adolescents have relationships that act in concert with one another...|$|R
