25|$|In 1911-12 the Kreuger family match {{factories}} in Kalmar, Fredriksdal and Mönsterås run {{by his father}} Ernst Kreuger, uncle Fredik Kreuger and his brother Torsten Kreuger, encountered financial problems.

25|$|The founders' {{financial}} and legal structure, {{adapted from the}} model developed for garden cemeteries in the America by City solicitor George Collison, aimed to establish a joint <b>stock</b> <b>corporation</b> managed by trustees. The trustees would be appointed by the members (those buying plots). Under the trust deed, the founders sought to preserve the park in perpetuity. The weakness of the model lay in the detail however, {{but this was not}} evident for thirty years. An eventual successful prosecution by the Crown, ruled that despite their unusual business model {{and the way in which}} plots were seemingly sold as freehold land, the legal arrangements were actually inadequate to achieve a different status from any other commercial cemetery, either for the company or the registered keepers of plots. In consequence, company income could not be held in trust for the park, but was to be treated as for any other commercial profit-making company and taxed accordingly.|$|E

500|$|The {{company was}} {{probably}} founded in 1874 (its first {{mention in the}} local address book) as Gebrüder Helfmann, Bauunternehmer by the Kelsterbach-born brothers Philipp and Balthasar Helfmann, a lumber merchant and mechanic respectively, in Bornheim near Frankfurt am Main. While Balthasar focused on the completion of construction contracts, Philipp developed the financing side of the business. Their first major contract was for the University of Giessen in 1878. By the 1880s the company had begun to produce its own construction materials but was still only a regional player. Shortly {{after the death of}} Balthasar, Philipp converted the company into a joint <b>stock</b> <b>corporation,</b> Aktiengesellschaft [...] für Hoch- und Tiefbauten ("Construction and Civil Engineering Corporation", though literally the [...] "Corporation for High - Hoch and Deep - Tief Construction - Bauten). A major development was the contract for the spa project in Bad Orb in 1899, with the corporation not simply erecting buildings but also to provide infrastructure like roads and gardens, to arrange the finances for the project, and to maintain some responsibilities for operating the project after its construction. Also in 1899, another turnkey project, a new grain silo in Genoa, Italy, was both the firm's first international venture and its first project using reinforced concrete. Philipp Helfmann died in the same year, with his son-in-law, Hans Weidmann, taking over as Chief Executive.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{corporate}} governance {{on the performance of}} 361 German firms over the period 1991 to 1996. In contrast to previous studies, we report systematic influences of corporate governance indicators on the profitability of German firms. In particular, ownership concentration affects firm performance in significantly negative fashion. This relationship depends on who commands the control rights over a firm. Firms owned by another industrial firm or controlled by banks have significantly lower rates of rerum than firms governed by families or foreign owners. Representation of owners {{on the board of directors}} tends to improve performance. These findings support the view that tighter governance curbs managerial discretion and expands shareholders' wealth. However, we also find that <b>stock</b> <b>corporations</b> with widely dispersed outside shareholdings outperformed <b>stock</b> <b>corporations</b> in which another industrial firm, banks, or different large shareholders had at least a blocking minority. These results imply that the presence of large shareholders does not necessarily enhance profitability...|$|R
