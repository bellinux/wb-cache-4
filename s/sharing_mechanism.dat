40|$|The Sharing Economy has {{predominantly}} {{been described}} as something inherently good and tightly coupled with new patterns of consumption rather than production. In this respect, {{there has been an}} empirical bias that involves not studying incumbent industrial actors’ adoption of <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> as a means for externalized operations. This paper explores how incumbent technology firms utilize <b>sharing</b> economy <b>mechanisms</b> in their pursuit of growth-related advantage. In addition to this, the paper discusses the implications that the adoption of <b>sharing</b> economy <b>mechanisms</b> may have for both business and society. According to the findings, firms display a disintegration of value creation practice through the utilization of <b>sharing</b> economy <b>mechanisms,</b> which in turn may threaten the basis for market formalism through the increased reliance of service bartering as a mechanism of production. Albeit currently a marginal phenomenon, we expect continued adoption of <b>sharing</b> economy <b>mechanisms</b> by incumbent actors to produce new challenges for the society...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{capacity}} {{demands in}} emerging wireless technologies {{are expected to}} be met by network densification and spectrum bands open to multiple technologies. These will, in turn, increase the level of interference and also result in more complex inter-technology interactions, which will need to be managed through spectrum <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Consequently, novel spectrum <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> should be designed to allow spectrum access for multiple technologies, while efficiently utilizing the spectrum resources overall. Importantly, it is not trivial to design efficient spectrum <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> not only due to technical aspects, but also due to regulatory and business model constraints. In this survey we address spectrum <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for wireless inter-technology coexistence by means of a technology circle that incorporates in a unified, system-level view the technical and non-technical aspects. We thus systematically explore the spectrum sharing design space consisting of parameters at different layers. Using this framework, we present a literature review on inter-technology coexistence with a focus on wireless technologies with the same spectrum access rights, i. e. (i) primary/primary, (ii) secondary/secondary, and (iii) technologies operating in a spectrum commons. Moreover, we reflect on our literature review to identify possible spectrum sharing design solutions and performance evaluation approaches useful for future coexistence cases. Finally, we discuss spectrum sharing design challenges and suggest potential future research directions. Comment: 28 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} sharing {{the cost of}} a common {{infrastructure}} among a set of strategic and cooperating players {{has been the subject of}} intensive research in recent years. However, most of these studies consider cooperative cost sharing games in an offline setting, i. e., the mechanism knows all players and their respective input data in advance. In this paper, we consider cooperative cost sharing games in an online setting: Upon the arrival of a new player, the mechanism has to take instantaneous and irreversible decisions without any knowledge about players that arrive in the future. We propose an online model for general demand cost sharing games and give a complete characterization of both weakly group-strategyproof and group-strategyproof online cost <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for this model. Moreover, we present a simple method to derive incremental online cost <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> from online algorithms such that the competitive ratio is preserved. Based on our general results, we develop online cost <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for several binary demand and general demand cost sharing games. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper models {{a supply}} chain of a manufacturer, a {{retailer}} and two different consumer segments. One segment has a high willingness-to-pay {{and the other a}} low willingness-to-pay. The manufacturer decides on the wholesale price and the selling price is determined by the retailer. It is well known that a straightforward wholesale price contract does not coordinate the channel. In this paper we show that two other types of contracts, namely the revenue sharing and the profit <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> do coordinate the supply chain and, furthermore, provide win-win for the entire range of parameter values. Our analysis has also established an equivalence relationship between the revenu and the profit <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> It is also shown that the pull discount mechanism (that is: the manufacturer provides a discount directly to the end consumers) coordinates for a greater range of parameter values compared to the wholesale price discount but not for the entire possible range. Moreover, for the situation where the manufacturer designs the targeted push-pull discount (Manufacturer provides a wholesale price discount to the retailer and a pull discounts which can be availed only by the low willingness to pay consumers) it is shown that it is possible for the channel to make a greater profit by extracting surplus from the high willingness-to-pay customers. However, “targeted push-pull” is feasible only with certain restrictions. Interestingly, we found that the revenue sharing or the profit <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> with the targeted pull discount is feasible when the “targeted push-pull” fails to coordinate. Even, in this case the performance of the targeted pull discount in combination with the revenue or profit <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is equivalent...|$|R

40|$|A {{business}} cluster is a co-located group of micro, small, medium scale enterprises. Such firms can benefit significantly from their co-location through shared infrastructure and shared services. Cost sharing becomes {{an important issue}} in such sharing arrangements especially when the firms exhibit strategic behavior.

40|$|Spectrum <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{need to be}} {{carefully}} designed to enable inter-technology coexistence in the unlicensed bands, as these bands are an instance of a spectrum commons where heterogeneous technologies and deployments must coexist. Unlike in licensed bands, where multiple technologies could coexist only in a primary-secondary DSA mode, a spectrum commons offers competition opportunities between multiple dominant technologies, such as Wi-Fi and the recently proposed LTE in the 5 GHz unlicensed band. In this paper we systematically study the performance of different spectrum sharing schemes for inter-technology coexistence in a spectrum commons. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose a general framework for comparative analysis of spectrum <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in time and frequency, by studying the effect of key constituent parameters. Second, we propose a novel throughput and interference model for inter-technology coexistence, integrating different distributed MAC <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{at the same level}} of abstraction. Finally, we present a case study of IEEE 802. 11 n Wi-Fi and LTE in the 5 GHz unlicensed band, in order to obtain generalizable insight into coexistence in a spectrum commons. Our extensive simulation results show that LTE/Wi-Fi coexistence in the 5 GHz band can be ensured simply through channel selection schemes, such that time-sharing MAC mechanisms are irrelevant. We also show that, in the general co-channel case, the coexistence performance of MAC <b>sharing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> strongly depends on the interference coupling in the network, as determined by building shielding. We thus identify two regimes: (i) low interference coupling, e. g. residential indoor scenarios, where duty cycle mechanisms outperform sensing-based LBT mechanisms; and (ii) high interference coupling, e. g. open-plan indoor or outdoor hotspot scenarios, where LBT outperforms duty cycle mechanisms.
