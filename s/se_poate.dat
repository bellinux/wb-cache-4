40|$|ABSTRACT- Traceability {{in a food}} sector can be {{obtained}} by developing traceability systems. These systems refer to recording all important data referring to the evolution of a product along the production and supply chain. The benefits derived from the application of this model are great for those involved in the wine production chain (producer, processor and distributor), and for the consumers ’ health. Thus, consumers are certain of the safety of the wines they buy, and their right for free choice is ensured by the transparency of the production and marketing chain. Wine producers and processors are more efficient from the viewpoint of products logistics. They might receive fewer complaints from consumers and apply the so-called due diligence defense – the proof they fulfilled their tasks, and they could finally use traceability in marketing to differentiate the products. The benefits for a better protection of public health and traceability help preventing frauds, when the authenticity of certain wines cannot be traced by analyses.
