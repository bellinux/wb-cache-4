40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} a postural support nappy and/or a postural <b>support</b> <b>roll</b> on neuromotor function in very preterm infants when nursed prone to term equivalent age. Methods: A randomized observer blind controlled trial of 123 very preterm infants was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit of the sole tertiary referral centre in Western Australia. Infants were stratified by gestational age (< 29 weeks or 29 - 30 weeks), then randomized into one of three intervention groups: postural support nappy, postural support nappy and postural <b>support</b> <b>roll,</b> or disposable nappy and postural <b>support</b> <b>roll.</b> Interventions started when infants were stable and ceased when routine side-lying commenced. Measurements of shoulder and hip posture were performed pre-intervention, 5 weeks post-intervention and term postmenstrual age. Results: Infants nursed with a postural <b>support</b> <b>roll</b> and a postural support nappy demonstrated improved hip posture to term equivalent age compared with infants nursed with either a postural <b>support</b> <b>roll</b> only, or a postural support nappy only. Infants nursed with a postural <b>support</b> <b>roll</b> either with or without a postural support nappy demonstrated improved shoulder posture to term equivalent age.

40|$|The {{formation}} of longitudinal off-corner depressions or “gutters ” in continuous-cast steel slabs {{has been investigated}} using coupled finite-element models. Thermal-mechanical behavior of the solidifying shell has been simulated as it moves down through the mold and upper <b>support</b> <b>rolls</b> in the spray chamber. The calculation includes solidification, intermittent gap formation, plastic creep, bulging due to ferrostatic pressure, interaction with the mold and rolls, and phase transformations. The effects of turbulent flow in the liquid pool, flow and melting of the powder layers, superheat dissipation, taper, and thermal distortion of the mold walls are accounted for using separate models. Together, these models illustrate a multi-stage mechanism for gutter formation. The problem starts with a hot, thin region down the off-corner wide face. This {{may be caused by}} locally-inadequate liquid powder feeding, or by insufficient taper of the upper portion of the narrow face mold walls, allowing corner rotation within the mold. Depressions may then be created by excessive taper, buckling the thin shell near mold exit. Alternatively, they may evolve during bulging between <b>support</b> <b>rolls</b> below the mold, due to bending of the thin off-corner region. The results suggest that the problem can be avoided by optimizing the mold flow pattern and powder properties to obtai...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation on using the variation of ferrostatic pressure exerted by the molten steel in the strand to the <b>support</b> <b>rolls</b> during continuous casting {{to detect the}} location of the final solidification. The final solidification point is of high importance for applying soft reduction during continuous casting {{in order to ensure}} inner quality and achieve high productivity. The measurement was conducted at one of the casters at SSAB Oxelösund, of which all the support rolls are separately mounted. The project finds that this method shows promising results and can help to narrow down the range of the location due to certain interferences and noises. The ferrostatic pressure decrease during tail-out and the variation of whether a pressure drop exists is the dividing line of full and partial solidification. With the promising results achieved, more effort should be put to further improve the method...|$|E
40|$|Computational {{modeling}} of thermal–mechanical behavior has {{great potential for}} understanding the formation of defects during solidification, especially when combined with appropriate failure criteria. This chapter summarizes the constitutive equations {{that can be used}} to model the complex phenomena that govern thermal–mechanical behavior of solidification macroprocesses. Important issues in model development are discussed, including the numerical treatment of thermal–mechanical coupling, boundary conditions, solid, mushy, and liquid phases, contact, and methods to solve the highly nonlinear and coupled equations. The steps in model development are extended to the prediction of hot-tear crack formation and validation with numerical benchmarks and experiments. Finally, three different practical applications of thermal mechanical models are presented. They range fromdistortion of complex-shaped foundry castings, taper optimization, and longitudinal crack formation during continuous casting of steel in the mold region, and the cyclic bulging and stresses that develop between <b>support</b> <b>rolls</b> during continuous casting of slabs. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn Rotating Continuous Casting (RCC), the {{vertical}} billet, the mould and the <b>support</b> <b>rolls</b> rotate at about 1 rotation/sec. The mould is fed by a liquid steel free plunging jet. A numerical modelling of the RCC has been developed. The {{aim of this}} article is to study the effects of the free plunging jet and of the rotation on : the fluid flow, the thermal state, the solidification and on the particles motion. The modelling of the RCC uses a levelset method to capture the interface between the liquid steel and argon. A stabilized Navier-Stokes method is used to compute the fluid flow. A stabilized thermal solver is used to study the thermal field and the solidification of steel. A Euler-Lagrange approach is used to solve the motion of argon bubbles and inclusions. Hydrodynamics and particles motion are confronted to observations made on a cold water model. All developed methods are validated and applied to the RCC...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{concerns the}} integration of Adaptive Search (AS) technique such as the Genetic Algorithms (GA) with knowledge based software to develop a research prototype of an Adaptive Search Manager (ASM). The developed approach allows to utilise both quantitative and qualitative information in engineering design decision making. A Fuzzy Expert System manipulates AS software within the design environment concerning the preliminary design of gas turbine blade cooling systems. Steady state cooling hole geometry models {{have been developed for}} the project in collaboration with Rolls Royce plc. The research prototype of ASM uses a hybrid of Adaptive Restricted Tournament Selection (ARTS) and Knowledge Based Hill Climbing (KBHC) to identify multiple "good" design solutions as potential design options. ARTS is a GA technique that is particularly suitable for real world problems having multiple sub-optima. KBHC uses information gathered during the ARTS search as well as information from the designer to perform a deterministic hill climbing. Finally, a local stochastic hill climbing fine tunes the "good" designs. Design solution sensitivity, design variable sensitivities and constraint sensitivities are calculated following Taguchi's methodology, which extracts sensitivity information with {{a very small number of}} model evaluations. Each potential design option is then qualitatively evaluated separately for manufacturability, choice of materials and some designer's special preferences using the knowledge of domain experts. In order to guarantee that the qualitative evaluation module can evaluate any design solution from the entire design space with a reasonably small number of rules, a novel knowledge representation technique is developed. The knowledge is first separated in three categories: inter-variable knowledge, intra-variable knowledge and heuristics. Inter-variable knowledge and intra-variable knowledge are then integrated using a concept of compromise. Information about the "good" design solutions is presented to the designer through a designer's interface for decision <b>support.</b> <b>Rolls</b> Royce plc., Bristol (UK...|$|E
