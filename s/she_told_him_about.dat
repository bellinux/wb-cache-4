25|$|Later {{the parties}} confer. The {{man in the}} teashop was Mr Lipscombe and when Miss Carnaby {{recognised}} him, she put on an act of allegiance to Andersen. Poirot realised this {{when he had the}} man followed back to the lodge. Andersen's chemistry background (although he was probably not a Jewish refugee) came in useful for preparing injections of hashish to produce ecstasy in his adherents, and also for injecting them with relevant bacteria when he wanted to kill them and inherit their estates. Andersen was about to inject Miss Carnaby with tuberculosis bacteria to tie in with the fictional ailment <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about.</b> The proof has been obtained in the laboratory in the sanctuary that the police have raided.|$|E
25|$|In {{the present}} {{universe}} of Camelot, King Arthur showed David the broken Excalibur after reading books {{on how to}} make it whole, and when he asked David to help him find the other half, David realized where the portion of the dagger came from. As for the dagger itself Emma is being drawn to it with each passing day, but is repelled by a protection spell put in place by Regina. The manifestation of Rumplestiltskin continues to consume Emma's mind to the point of Emma nearly hurting Hook. The effects are starting a toll on Emma, prompting an intervention from Hook, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, and Regina, but before they {{can come up with a}} solution, Mary Margaret asks David for a moment alone to talk to her husband, and as expected, was to tell him about King Arthur. However, when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Lancelot being alive and the message he gave her, David ended up defending Arthur, believing that he is being very trustworthy. Mary Margaret on the other hand, believes David has become friends with Arthur because he misses the life he enjoyed back in the Enchanted Forest and that fulfilling it as a Knight in the Round Table will make him important again.|$|E
2500|$|Meier responded saying, [...] "You're {{the kind}} of boy a girl would kill herself over." [...] The last few exchanges were made via AOL Instant Messenger instead of MySpace. When she ran upstairs, she ran into her father. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the trouble and went to her room. Ron went downstairs to the kitchen where he and Tina talked about the {{cyberbullying}} and made dinner. Twenty minutes later, Tina suddenly froze in mid-sentence, and ran up to Meier's room. Meier had hanged herself with a belt in the bedroom closet. Despite attempts to revive her, Meier was pronounced dead the next day on October 17, three weeks before her 14th birthday.|$|E
60|$|She {{took him}} in hand in perfect good faith. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> things <b>about</b> his accent, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> things <b>about</b> his bearing, about his costume and his {{way of looking at}} things. She thrust the blade of her {{intelligence}} into the tenderest corners of Kipps' secret vanity, she slashed his most intimate pride to bleeding tatters. He sought very diligently to anticipate some at least of these informing thrusts by making great use of Coote. But the unanticipated made a brave number....|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> Tom's {{letter and}} her {{subsequent}} revolt. Dr. Hamilton never once {{made the mistake}} of smiling. He listened and approved and sympathized.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> it, and {{he listened}} in silent {{endeavor}} for {{the ground of}} censure from which a sense of his own guilt forced him. She asked suddenly, [...] "Where did you see him?" [...] {{and he told her}} in turn.|$|R
2500|$|During {{her stay}} at Yaddo, Highsmith met writer Marc Brandel, son of author J.D. Beresford. Even though <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> her homosexuality, they soon {{entered into a}} {{short-lived}} relationship. He convinced her to visit him in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where he introduced her to Ann Smith, a painter and designer with a previous métier as a Vogue fashion model, and the two became involved. After Smith left Provincetown, Highsmith felt she was [...] "in prison" [...] with Brandel and {{told him she was}} leaving. [...] "ecause of that I have to sleep with him, and only {{the fact that it is}} the last night strengthens me to bear it." [...] Highsmith, who had [...] never been sexually exclusive with Brandel, resented having sex with him. Highsmith temporarily broke off the relationship with Brandel and continued to be involved with several women; reuniting after the well-received publication of his new novel. Beginning November 30, 1948, and continuing for the next six months, Highsmith underwent psychoanalysis in an effort [...] "to regularize herself sexually" [...] so she could marry Brandel. The analysis was brought to a stop by Highsmith, after which she ended her relationship with him.|$|E
60|$|In answer <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> {{the letter}} from Constance asking for her photograph.|$|E

6000|$|... "Tell me {{something}} about yourself {{and the country}} you came from," [...] said the Scarecrow, when she had finished her dinner. So <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone had carried her to this queer Land of Oz.|$|R
5000|$|Richard Brancatisano as Dominic Russo, an arts {{reporter}} at The Boston Post and April's love interest. Breaks up with April after finding out <b>she</b> hadn't <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> cancer. Then, begins to date April’s sister, Natalie but he doesn't commit to it, because he's clearly {{still in love}} with April.|$|R
60|$|They {{had a long}} talk after that--or, rather, Grandma {{talked and}} the dark man listened and smiled. <b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> William George and Delia and their baby and about Samuel and Adelaide and Cyrus and Louise and the three cats and the parrot. He seemed to enjoy her {{accounts}} of them too.|$|R
60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> {{the water}} that had run along {{the nose of the}} old four-wheeler man.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the {{marriage}} of his former friend, Merton Chance, with Constance, and about their disappearance, and her anxiety to find her friend.|$|E
6000|$|I {{waited until}} his small, round eye had rolled {{back in my}} direction. [...] "Yes, Adam," [...] I said, [...] "but what did he say? You mean <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see, doctor, that I {{have been}} in error. I {{suspected}} you of being an accomplice of Netta's in a little scheme in which she is engaged on her own account." [...] And <b>she</b> then <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> her disappearance, of the letter that she had received, and of the conversation with her aunt. Dr. Leeds was seriously disturbed.|$|R
5000|$|Don Pablo Xuárez- The 78-year-old {{governor}} of Cuautitlán. Testified that his grandmother Justina Cananea personally knew Juan Diego, his wife Maria Lucía, and his uncle Juan Bernardino and that <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> everything <b>about</b> the apparition. He also claimed the miracle “was so public and well-known, {{how it all}} happened, that even the children sang all about it in their games.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Billy {{is upset}} <b>she</b> never <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the abusive ex. He leaves her room. Cuddy asks about the masseuse. House {{says she is}} a hooker he used to get [...] "happy endings" [...] from. After going through 15 {{different}} massage therapists, {{this is the only}} one he likes. Cuddy says she won't see him any more unless he stops seeing the hooker/masseuse.|$|R
60|$|Yes, that {{is better}} {{and has more}} composure. That is {{just the way it}} happened. He told her about the wet-nurse, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> {{political}} justice; he told her about the deadly sister-in-law, <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> her mother; he told her about the bonnet-shop, she murmured back about the rights of woman; then he assuaged her, then she assuaged him; then he assuaged her some more, next she assuaged him some more; then they both assuaged one another simultaneously; and so they went on by the hour assuaging and assuaging and assuaging, until at last what was the result? They were in love. It will happen so every time.|$|E
60|$|His {{question}} suggested {{something of}} anterior import, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the silhouettes, and the advantage {{the young people}} had taken of their power over her through their knowledge of her foolish behavior at the ball.|$|E
60|$|Anne made up {{her mind}} that the next time she wrote a story she wouldn't ask anybody to criticize it. It was too discouraging. She would not read the story to Gilbert, {{although}} <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I believe no {{one could}} teach that to you,' she {{answered}} adoringly, but Peter thought she meant that he was stupid. <b>She</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Tony and of the wicked thing she did in the dark to frighten him (she knew quite well that it was wicked), but Peter misunderstood her meaning and said, 'Oh, how I wish I was as brave as Tony!' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> {{his cousin}} Owen. Indeed, the {{greater number of}} the soft musical words which she had spoken in that long three hours' {{colloquy}} had been spoken on this special point. It had behoved her to tell him all; and she thought that she had done so. Nay, she had done so with absolute truth--to the best of her heart's power.|$|R
6000|$|...

60|$|He never {{succeeded in}} getting on a {{friendly}} footing with the Mormon Whisner, though he kept up his agreeable and kindly advances. He listened to the trader's wife as <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the Indians, and what he learned he did not forget. And his wonder and respect increased in proportion to his knowledge.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> {{the party}} and Cartwright chuckled. He pictured her in the dirty mess-room, looking exotic in her fashionable clothes and {{expensive}} furs, but no doubt quite serene. She said the other girl was pretty, but Cartwright admitted that Barbara was beautiful. He rather sympathized with Lister's embarrassment, and wondered whether Barbara meant to throw {{some light on the}} young man's character.|$|E
6000|$|A tete-a-tete {{with him}} was {{necessary}} on many accounts, and she lay in wait to obtain a few moments alone {{with him in the}} study. He complied neither eagerly nor reluctantly, bowed his head without remark when <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the funeral, and took the sponsorship as a matter of course. 'Very well; I suppose there is no one else to be found. Is it your brother's thought?' ...|$|E
5000|$|After it, Devlin asks Rebecca why <b>she</b> {{has never}} <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> [...] "this lover of yours" [...] and says {{how he has}} [...] "a right to be very angry indeed" [...] that she did not, [...] "Do you {{understand}} that?" [...] (69-70).|$|R
50|$|Michael Ellis: Luke's {{colleague}} in America. He and Becky becomes good friends. It was <b>she</b> who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> what Alicia {{had done}} that lead him to telling Luke the truth, but keeping Becky a secret to himself. Michael offers her a job in Washington D.C. when he learns that she is in debt and has no job. He also encourages her to find work she's passionate about and not fall into anything she's doesn't like.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the same}} day, Gurdarshan Singh {{organized}} a press conference. He announced that Rajesh killed Aarushi and Hemraj {{to hide his}} extramarital affair with Anita Durrani. He claimed that Aarushi's friend Anmol stated that <b>she</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> her father's affair. (On 22 May, the police had questioned Anmol, who had 688 phone interactions {{with her in the}} 45 days preceding her murder.) Singh presented the following possible sequence of events, but did not mention any specific evidence: ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{found his}} wife up and dressed, and waiting {{provisionally}} on the sofa. [...] "I thought I {{might as well}} go to lunch," [...] she said, and then <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Agatha and Burnamy, and the means she had employed to comfort and encourage the girl. [...] "And now, dearest, I want you to find out where Burnamy is, and give him a hint. You will, won't you! If you could have seen how unhappy she was!" ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the Brangwens, {{and about}} her mother, and about Skrebensky, her first love, and about her later experiences. He sat very still, {{watching}} {{her as she}} talked. And he seemed to listen with reverence. Her face was beautiful and full of baffled light as she told him {{all the things that}} had hurt her or perplexed her so deeply. He seemed to warm and comfort his soul at the beautiful light of her nature.|$|E
60|$|Since {{a letter}} might not reach {{him for some}} time, she had better write at once, and she got some paper and began. It was easy to write to Thirlwell, and <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the lame man who had broken into the house, before she came to Stormont's offer. Indeed, when she stopped she was {{surprised}} to see how much she had said. After fastening the envelope she {{got up and went to}} the window, where she drew the thick curtain behind her and looked out.|$|E
5000|$|U.S. National Archives records {{indicate}} that Wayne had, in fact, made an application [...] {{to serve in}} the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), that day's equivalent of the CIA, and had been accepted within the U.S. Army's allotted billet to the OSS. William J. Donovan, OSS Commander, wrote Wayne a letter informing him of his acceptance into the Field Photographic Unit, but the letter went to his estranged wife Josephine's home. <b>She</b> never <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it. Donovan also issued an OSS Certificate of Service to Wayne.|$|R

The mayor then enters, and Skank expresses his disgust at the decision.|$|R
60|$|Paw in paw they {{appeared}} before the princess, and told her {{the story of their}} life and its sorrows. The princess wept for sympathy, and promised that they should never more be parted, but should live with her to the end of their days. By-and-bye the princess herself got married, and brought a prince to dwell in the palace in the park. And <b>she</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> her two cats, and how brave Gon had been, and how he had delivered her from her enemy the serpent.|$|R
