As a result, a ladder match was set up, where the winner would become the undisputed OVW Women's Champion. Lea won the match and was {{presented}} with the title belt on the first show of 2007. Throughout 2007, Phoenix continued to wrestle in numerous women's matches in OVW. Phoenix made her last appearance in OVW at their August 15 television tapings where she lost to Lea in a number one contenders match.|$|E
5|$|After Hardy's client Adam Cole {{defeated}} Jay Briscoe {{to become}} the Undisputed Ring of Honor World Champion, Cole presented Jay Briscoe's custom made world championship belt (Briscoe claimed to <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Ring of Honor champion as he forfeited the title due to injury and never officially lost it) to Hardy as a show of appreciation, Hardy re-branded the belt as the Ring of Honor Iconic (Innovative Creator and Originator of a New-Found Industry Champion) Championship, however, the title has not been sanctioned as an official championship by Ring of Honor. On June 22, 2014 at Best in the World, Hardy and Michael Bennett were defeated by The Briscoe Brothers in a no disqualification tag team match. In July, Hardy opted out of his ROH contract {{and went back to}} TNA.|$|E
5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to be strictly massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, it would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), {{but it would not}} be the speed of photons.|$|E

5|$|In February 2014, Shelbourne sought court {{approval}} {{to take up}} an offer of up to $135million from Atlas Apartment Holdings intended to underpin the project's emergence from bankruptcy, with a deadline of August 31, 2014 for having a court-approved reorganization plan. At a hearing on March 11, 2014, Shelbourne announced that it had reached agreement on a repayment plan with the project's creditors, including Related Midwest, which had bought up much of the project's debt. Assuming the project finds funding to satisfy that agreement, Atlas said that the building would be built and that Atlas would control the project, but that Kelleher would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> developer, {{with the intention of}} building the same building planned prior to suspension of construction.|$|E
5|$|Riego's Revolt had two {{significant}} {{effects on the}} war in the Americas. Militarily, the large numbers of reinforcements, which were especially needed to retake New Granada and defend the Viceroyalty of Peru, would never arrive. Furthermore, as the royalists' situation became more desperate in region after region, the army experienced wholesale defections of units to the patriot side. Politically, the reinstitution of a liberal regime changed the terms under which the Spanish government sought to engage the insurgents. The new government naively assumed that the insurgents were fighting for Spanish liberalism and that the Spanish Constitution could <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> basis of reconciliation between the two sides. The government implemented the Constitution and held elections in the overseas provinces, just as in Spain. It also ordered military commanders to begin armistice negotiations with the insurgents with the promise that they could participate in the restored representative government.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{cause of death}} in temperate areas is likely to be starvation, particularly over the autumn and winter period when first year birds are still perfecting their hunting skills. In northern and upland areas, there is some correlation between mortality in older birds and adverse weather, deep-lying snow and prolonged low temperatures. Collision with road vehicles is another cause of mortality, and may result when birds forage on mown verges. Some of these birds are in poor condition and may have been less able to evade oncoming vehicles than fit individuals would have been. Historically, many deaths were caused by the use of pesticides, and this may <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case {{in some parts of the}} world. Collisions with power-lines kill some birds and shooting accounts for others, especially in Mediterranean regions.|$|E

5|$|Between 1692 and 1806, {{only four}} {{descriptions}} of frozen mammoths {{were published in}} Europe. None of the remains of those five were preserved, and no complete skeleton was recovered during that time. While frozen woolly mammoth carcasses had been excavated by Europeans as early as 1728, the first fully documented specimen was discovered near the delta of the Lena River in 1799 by Ossip Schumachov, a Siberian hunter. Schumachov let it thaw until he could retrieve the tusks for sale to the ivory trade. While in Yakutsk in 1806, Michael Friedrich Adams heard about the frozen mammoth. Upon arrival at the location, Adams discovered that wild animals had eaten most of the organs and flesh of the mammoth, including the trunk. He examined the carcass and realised what was left would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most complete mammoth recovered by that time. Adams recovered the entire skeleton, apart from the tusks, which Shumachov had already sold, and one foreleg, most of the skin, and nearly 18kg (40lb) of hair. During his return voyage he purchased a pair of tusks that he believed {{were the ones that}} Shumachov had sold. Adams brought it to the Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the task of mounting the skeleton was given to Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius. The Kunstkamera, the museum established by Peter the Great, contained the skeleton of an Indian elephant that could be used as reference. This {{was one of the first}} attempts at reconstructing the skeleton of an extinct animal. Most of the reconstruction is correct, but Tilesius placed each tusk in the opposite socket, so that they curved outward instead of inward. The error was not corrected until 1899, and the correct placement of mammoth tusks was still a matter of debate into the twentieth century.|$|E

25|$|Western {{designers}} {{often feel}} the need to tinker with the proa. They are attracted by the minimalist nature and amazing speeds that proas are capable of (they may <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> fastest sailboats per dollar spent for the home builder) but they often want the proa to do more; adding cabins, different sailing rigs, and bidirectional rudders are common changes made.

25|$|To contrast, in {{a process}} that is not a martingale, it may <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case that the {{expected}} value of the process at one time is equal to the expected value of the process at the next time. However, knowledge of the prior outcomes (e.g., all prior cards drawn from a card deck) may be able to reduce the uncertainty of future outcomes. Thus, the expected value of the next outcome given knowledge of the present and all prior outcomes may be higher than the current outcome if a winning strategy is used. Martingales exclude the possibility of winning strategies based on game history, and thus they are a model of fair games.|$|E
25|$|Adams {{knew that}} his own victory in the {{contingent}} election would require the support of Clay, who despite being eliminated from the deliberation, would, as Speaker of the House, <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most important player in determining {{the outcome of the}} election. In contrast with Clay, Crawford believed in a weak, limited federal government. Jackson's policy views were unclear, but Clay had been outraged by Jackson's actions in Florida, and he feared what Jackson would do in office. Clay's American System called for high tariffs, federally-funded internal improvements, and a national bank, all of which were supported by Adams. Adams and Clay met prior to the contingent election, and Clay agreed to support Adams.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} of ordering the new multipurpose icebreaker {{was made in}} late 2004 and the Finnish Environment Institute and the Finnish Maritime Administration were authorized by the Government to make an agreement on the vessel and launch a request for tenders in early 2005. The new oil spill response vessel was expected to enter service in 2007. However, only a few offers were received and the new vessel, for which 134 million euro was reserved in the budget, {{turned out to be}} more expensive than expected. After evaluating more economic alternatives in October 2005 the committee working on the project came to a conclusion that a new multipurpose oil recovery vessel would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best solution to improve spill response readiness. 35 million euro were allocated for the purchasing of the new vessel.|$|E
25|$|The redeveloped {{building}} {{was designed by}} local W Architects with the glass-clad rotunda designed inspired by Chinese American I.M. Pei. The chief design consultant was Mok Wei Wei from W Architects, who was appointed in June 2004 and modified the designs of glass rotunda and the atrium between the two buildings. The new glass clad {{building was}} designed such that the old building would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> centrepiece of the museum. A six-metre gap exists between {{the back of the}} main museum building and its new annexe as conservation guidelines do not allow old and new buildings to be directly connected. In the gallery theatre, bricks are designed in a herringbone brick pattern, which helps to control the echoes and acoustics in the space. Initially, the designers planned to use bricks from the old National Library building, but the cost was too expensive. Black concrete flooring was used for the new block instead of grey granite flooring as initially planned.|$|E
25|$|Michael Spinks {{became a}} {{professional}} boxer {{shortly after he}} {{won the gold medal}} at middleweight in the 1976 Summer Olympics. Initially, Spinks was more concerned with assisting his brother Leon's rise to the heavyweight championship, but was later convinced to turn pro himself. In 1981 Spinks fought Eddie Mustafa Muhammad for the WBA light heavyweight championship and defeated him by decision to win his first world title. The next year Spinks won the lineal championship from Mustafa Wassaja and then took the WBC title from Dwight Braxton in 1983 to become the undisputed champion. In 1984, Spinks added the newly created IBF title. In September 1985, after having defended his titles a combined total of ten times, Spinks moved up to the heavyweight class to challenge reigning IBF, Ring, and lineal champion Larry Holmes, who had been champion since 1978. Spinks defeated Holmes in a fifteen-round decision to become the first reigning light heavyweight champion to win the heavyweight championship. Spinks defeated Holmes again in a rematch and then successfully defended his title against Steffen Tangstad. Instead of defending his IBF title against top contender Tony Tucker, Spinks elected to take a more lucrative fight with former contender Gerry Cooney, who had fought three times in five years, in June 1987. The IBF responded by stripping Spinks of the title, but he was still in possession of the lineal and Ring titles and was considered by many to <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> rightful champion.|$|E
