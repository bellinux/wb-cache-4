Dorothy Ferrell, for example, stated in a 2000 affidavit that she felt under pressure from police to identify Davis as the shooter because she was on parole for a shoplifting conviction. In a 2002 affidavit, Darrell Collins wrote that the police had <b>scared</b> <b>him</b> into falsely testifying by threatening to charge him as an accessory to the crime, and alleged that he had not seen Davis do anything to Young. Antoine Williams, Larry Young and Monty Holmes also stated in affidavits that their earlier testimony implicating Davis had been coerced by strong-arm police tactics.

Captain McSorley said he did not like the action of a ship he described as a [...] "wiggling thing" [...] that <b>scared</b> <b>him.</b> Fitzgeralds bow hooked to {{one side or the other}} in heavy seas without recovering and made a groaning sound not heard on other ships.|$|E

500|$|After the incident, Brodevik {{described}} his {{and the other}} band member's situation as [...] "trapped like rats."

500|$|According to Chahi, he was {{inspired}} by his 1999 trip to Mount Yasur's crater in Vanuatu. The scenery, {{and the power of}} the volcano, which was extremely active at the time, fascinated and <b>scared</b> <b>him.</b> Chahi, still intending to make another video game [...] "before [...] died", hoped that his next project could convey the: [...] "ambivalence of Nature, beautiful and potentially violent at the same time". Becoming more and more interested in the world's natural forces, Chahi went on to visit different volcanoes, including Dolomieu crater on Reunion Island, and a volcano in the Indian Ocean. Once the development was underway, Montpellier even recorded audio from a real volcano for inclusion in the game. Nature and cycle were some of the most important key elements of the game. The team intended to create different cycles and loops that would result in different kinds of interaction between the environments. For example, the tide cycle and eruption cycle changes dynamically, and it impacts the growth of plants and the lives of the villagers. According to Chahi, the cycle allows players to anticipate what will happen next.|$|E

500|$|Despite his injury, Stewart said {{he hoped}} to {{participate}} in a planned two-day test session at Phoenix International Raceway. He also said he was worried about his crash because his legs and hips were tingling and his lower back was in pain. Stewart said the crash <b>scared</b> <b>him</b> and the tingling in his legs had improved after leaving the infield care center. Kurt Busch's crew chief Pat Tryson stated that he and the Penske Racing South team were relieved that the driver emerged uninjured after his crash on lap 256, and that they would do better at the next weekend's race.

According to Kenseth, [...] "I {{knew he was going to}} get a run on me, so I laid back a little bit...We came off [...] 2 and I was up as high as I thought I could, and Jeff just came across.

[...] Gordon {{said he hoped}} Speedway Motorsports chairman and chief executive Bruton Smith (the owner of Las Vegas Motor Speedway) would install SAFER barriers along the inside retaining walls around the track.

Club Todd VanDerWerff {{gave it a}} [...] "B", {{and wrote}} that he [...] "finally got a sense that, yes, this second season has been {{building}} toward something and {{has been trying to}} tell an emotional story, as well as a humorous one. 'Born This Way', {{for the first time in}} a long time, made me feel like I could say I was a fan of Glee without a million qualifiers." [...] Gary Mills of the Florida Times-Union felt that the episode didn't live up to its hype, but also said that he wasn't disappointed. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair reacted positively, and noted that by [...] "focusing on what makes these lovable dorks, well, lovable dorks—and not pop, or high-school, superstars—tonight's episode, if a bit tidily, reminded us that these are supposed to be kids". Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon thought that [...] "Born This Way" [...] was [...] "the show's best episode to date", and [...] "an epic about a hero returning from a long journey, walking serenely through halls that once <b>scared</b> <b>him,</b> and performing with such skill and sincerity that his friends stared at him with love and awe." [...] Aly Semigran of MTV had mixed emotions. She criticized the abrupt changes of the storylines in the episode, and thought that the episode [...] "was a noble effort" [...] but [...] "it didn't quite work the way it was supposed to." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal stated that the episode [...] "sounded just the perfect notes" [...] and called it [...] "the best episode yet". He continued: [...] "The night held wonderful gems: A clear message. Witty repartee (…). Great character build up. And tailored songs that carried emotional heft." ...|$|E
