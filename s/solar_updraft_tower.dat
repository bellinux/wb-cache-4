5|$|The <b>Solar</b> <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> (SUT) is a renewable-energy {{power plant}} for {{generating}} electricity from low temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath {{a very wide}} greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central base of a very tall chimney tower. The resulting convection causes a hot air updraft in the tower by the chimney effect. This airflow drives wind turbines placed in the chimney updraft or around the chimney base to produce electricity. Plans for scaled-up versions of demonstration models will allow significant power generation, and may allow development of other applications, such as water extraction or distillation, and agriculture or horticulture.|$|E

In the next chaper there is a division of solar chimneys and it mainly focuses on describing the <b>solar</b> <b>updraft</b> <b>towers</b> and <b>solar</b> floating chimneys. And marginally it focuses on solar downdraft towers. Next there are possibilities how to use principle of solar chimney for air conditioning and ventilation.

40|$|Process {{waste heat}} in large power {{generation}} plants is commonly rejected to lakes or rivers, {{or through the}} use of cooling towers. Although these waste heat rejection methods are quite effective, they may not be feasible in every application due to cost considerations or geographic location. Moreover, it is desirable to use the waste heat in additional processes, if possible, both from the standpoint of improved plant efficiency as well as reduced environmental impact. A comprehensive analysis of alternative methods of power plant waste heat rejection is presented here. Six approaches for rejecting or recovering the waste heat are considered: cooling canals, open-water algae bioreactors, wintertime greenhouse heating, spray ponds, modified <b>solar</b> <b>towers,</b> and <b>updraft</b> <b>towers</b> with heat exchangers. Each of the six technologies can be sized for the needs and operating conditions of a given power plant. The quantitative analysis tools developed in this work are validated by benchmarking against published results. Four of the alternative methods generate secondary benefits: the algae bioreactor, greenhouse heating, the modified <b>solar</b> <b>tower,</b> and the <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> with a heat exchanger produce biodiesel, extended periods of horticulture, and electric power, respectively. ^ The Hoosier Energy power plant in Merom, Indiana is used as a case study for each alternative method of waste heat rejection. Each technology is designed to reject 332 MW of waste heat from the Merom plant. This heat rejection load is selected for the comparison as it represents the amount needed to lower the temperature of the waste water issuing from the power plant by 5 degrees Fahrenheit, a goal determined by Hoosier Energy to maintain a healthy habitat for the aquatic species residing in the reservoir. A comparison of the land footprint required to reject the 332 MW of heat using each of the alternative technologies is discussed. The sensitivity of the sizing of the different technologies to changes in the environmental and geometric parameters is quantified. Each technology presented here is a viable means of heat rejection from Hoosier Energy’s Merom power plant. ...|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the <b>Solar</b> <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> to generate electricity from thermal air currents also be used {{at the same time}} for amine gravity scrubbing of CO2. Some heat would be required to regenerate the amine.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} <b>solar</b> <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> has a {{power conversion}} rate considerably lower {{than many other}} designs in the (high temperature) solar thermal group of collectors. The low conversion rate is balanced to some extent by the lower cost per square metre of solar collection.|$|E
40|$|An <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> {{cooling system}} is {{proposed}} to eliminate water use and utilize heat rejection in large-scale power plants. The <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> has an annular heat exchanger distributed around an inlet at the base; ambient air is drawn {{up through the}} tower chimney due to the density difference between the heated air at the base and the cooler air at the top. A secondary loop, configured as a vapor-compression cooling cycle, is used to transfer {{the heat from the}} power plant condenser to the tower base. Recuperative turbines in the tower harness the energy available in the waste heat air stream to assist in powering the secondary cooling cycle and increase the cooling system efficiency. The system feasibility is evaluated from thermodynamic perspective by comparing the net power needed to operate the system versus alternative dry cooling schemes. A detailed thermodynamic model coupling the power plant, secondary loop, and <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> systems is developed. Parametric studies involving changes in <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> geometry, heat exchanger size, and operating conditions are conducted to develop system design methodologies for optimized performance; water, R 134 a, R 600 a, and R 290 are evaluated as alternative secondary cooling cycle refrigerants. The size of the <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> is critical to the system performance. Increases in the tower diameter and height (up to reasonable construction limits) increase the system work output. The cooling system efficiency can be improved by lowering the secondary loop condensing temperature to reduce the compression work, but this requires a larger size tower to maintain the same heat rejection rate. Similarly, increasing the secondary loop evaporating temperature can reduce the compression work, but requires a larger heat exchange surface area. An optimum depth of the heat exchanger at the tower base (i. e., the secondary loop condenser) is identified that maximizes the work output. For an optimized system design, the required work input to the <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> cooling system is shown to be less than for a typical air-cooled condenser at the same heat rejection rate. By allowing the power plant condensing temperature to increase, a simple pumped loop can be used to replace the secondary vapor-compression cooling cycle as the secondary loop. With the same <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> parameters and heat exchangers design, the simulation model predicts the pumped loop provides better performance and consumes less power as compared to the vapor compression loop. With a tower height similar to existing water-cooled cooling <b>towers,</b> the <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> system with a pumped secondary loop can allow for dry cooling with significantly less efficiency penalty compared to air-cooled condensers. This work provides a framework for judgement of the <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> dry cooling system feasibility from a thermodynamic perspective. ...|$|R

25|$|An E-66 {{wind turbine}} in the Windpark Holtriem, Germany, has an {{observation}} deck for visitors.

Airborne wind turbine designs have been proposed and developed for many years but have yet to produce significant amounts of energy. In principle, wind turbines may also be {{used in conjunction with}} a large vertical <b>solar</b> <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> to extract the energy due to air heated by the sun.|$|E
25|$|A related {{approach}} is the <b>solar</b> <b>updraft</b> <b>tower,</b> which heats air in glass enclosures at ground level and sends the heated air up a tower driving turbines at the base. Updraft towers do not pump water, which increases their efficiency, but do require large amounts of land for the collectors. Land acquisition and collector construction costs for updraft towers must be compared to pumping infrastructure costs for downdraft collectors. Operationally, maintaining the collector structures for updraft towers must be compared to pumping costs and pump infrastructure maintenance.|$|E
40|$|An <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> {{cooling system}} is {{assessed}} for elimination of water use associated with power plant heat rejection. Heat rejected {{from the power}} plant condenser is used to warm the air {{at the base of}} an updraft tower; buoyancy-driven air flows through a recuperative turbine inside the tower. The secondary loop, which couples the power plant condenser to a heat exchanger at the tower base, can be configured either as a constant-pressure pump cycle or a vapor compression cycle. The novel use of a compressor can elevate the air temperature in the tower base to increases the turbine power recovery and decrease the power plant condensing temperature. The system feasibility is evaluated by comparing the net power needed to operate the system versus alternative dry cooling schemes. A thermodynamic model coupling all system components is developed for parametric studies and system performance evaluation. The model predicts that constant-pressure pump cycle consumes less power than using a compressor; the extra compression power required for temperature lift is much larger than the gain in turbine power output. The <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> system with a pumped secondary loop can allow dry cooling with less power plant efficiency penalty compared to air-cooled condensers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>solar</b> <b>updraft</b> {{power plant}} is a {{promising}} technology for harnessing the solar energy and many researchers developed the plant design {{to improve its}} low efficiency. Using a sloped solar collector {{is one of the}} novel techniques that improves the plant efficiency in higher latitudes and reduce its capital cost. In this paper, a pilot Sloped <b>Solar</b> <b>Updraft</b> Power Plant (SSUPP) is constructed in the campus of mechanical engineering department of Damascus University in Syria. Thermometers were installed in the sloped solar collector to measure glass, air, and absorption layer temperatures along the collector. Solar radiation, ambient air temperature as well as air velocity inside the chimney were also recorded. These data were taken every 10 minutes throughout the year 2012 to investigate the performance of the SSUPP. In this paper, the effect of the average monthly recorded values of solar radiation and ambient temperature on the prototype performance were analyzed in all weather conditions and the changes in sloped solar collector outlet temperatures were investigated. The results show that the difference between the ambient temperature and the chimney inlet temperature is almost the same in winter and summer seasons leading to a conclusion of the advantage of having an inclined solar collector in the SSUPP...|$|R

25|$|Actual {{measurements}} on the 50kW Manzanares pilot <b>solar</b> <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> found a conversion efficiency of 0.53%, although SBP {{believe that this}} could be increased to 1.3% in a large and improved 100MW unit.

The usage of water as a working-medium dramatically increases the potential for thermal energy capture, and electrical generation, due to its specific heat capacity. While the design may have its problems (see next section) and the stated efficiency claims has yet to be demonstrated, it would be an error to extrapolate performance from one to the other simply because of similarities in the name.|$|E

The RFD of a supercell is believed to play a large part in tornadogenesis by further tightening rotation within the surface mesocyclone. RFDs are caused by mid level steering winds of a supercell colliding with the <b>updraft</b> <b>tower</b> and moving around it in all directions; specifically the flow that is redirected downward {{is referred to as the}} RFD. This downward surge of relatively cool mid level air, due to interactions between dew points, humidity, and condensation of the converging of air masses, can reach very high speeds and is known to cause widespread wind damage.
