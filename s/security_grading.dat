40|$|In this paper, we pioneer a key {{security}} level gradation scheme which is proved to efficient to counteract Iterative-Encrypting-Attack against RSA. And {{we make it}} clear that the bug which hides after the traditional key generation algorithm is exploited by Iterative-Encrypting-Attack and weakens RSA security, and that the case can be improved if the traditional key generation algorithm is modified delicately. After analyzing the preliminary and practical steps of Iterative Encrypting Attack in detail, we propose the concept of <b>security</b> <b>grade</b> of key-pair and depict the hierarchy of grades systematically, and bring forward an algorithm that <b>grades</b> <b>security</b> <b>grade</b> of key pairs. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of attack cost into the gradation prototype, then program for grading algorithm and set in motion a series of experiments for surveying the relationship between attack-cost and key-security-grade. At last, by the attained result from experimental statistics, we point it out  that if key-pair is properly chosen RSA system can acquire a satisfying immunity from Iterative Encrypting Attack...|$|R
40|$|Dual-rail Precharged Logic (DPL) {{theoretically}} withstands Side-Channel Attacks {{owing to}} its physical-level compensation manner between the tailored complementary rails. However, the <b>security</b> <b>grade</b> of DPLs can be severely impaired by the innate silicon Process Variation (PV), even the two rails are identically constructed. In this paper, an active thermal compensation system {{is presented to}} alleviate the PV-relevant security tension for SCA-resistant dual-rail logic. The devised system consists of a Ring-Oscillator (RO) based temperature sensor pair and two groups of heat generators, respectively scaled {{with each of the}} complementary crypto cores. The heaters are automatically switched on in accordance to the frequency difference measured by the ROs. The more secure compensation is achieved by tuning the local thermal to the one wherein higher RO frequency is detected, for affecting the local electrical characteristics to slow down the higher frequency. The protocol of the system and the implementation flow are detailed in this paper. The security verifications are validated by employing the RO thermal system to a lightweight crypto coprocessor in its identical dual-rail format.

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to The University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Medicine. Radiology {{is one of the}} most high-tech fields of medicine. The digitization of medical information including radiographic data has led to improved efficiency and productivity but it has also presented new challenges in the area of privacy and security. In this study we have tried to answer some questions regarding how secure the current electronic radiology systems are and what individual and systemic factors affect the security and privacy of confidential patient data. A total of 77 radiologists and radiology residents participated in an online survey which included questions on physical security, computer systems security, and training and prevention. Since there was no objective way to measure overall security, we have used the overall <b>security</b> <b>grade</b> given by survey takers as our outcome, the dependent variable. Multiple regression analysis and ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) analyses were conducted. The regression analysis, with few exceptions, showed that only two variables contributed significantly to the final <b>security</b> <b>grade.</b> One of them was about unauthorized persons gaining access to the radiology facility, and the second one was about locking computer screens when temporarily away from a work station. A separate analysis was done using data for physical security, 4 computer systems security, training and prevention, and other security/privacy questions. Security threat level to current radiology systems is very low; however, the preparedness of these facilities to protect their infrastructure from future attacks is not adequate and there is room for improvement. As far as keeping confidential patient information private, most institutions seem to be doing a good job...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} an {{elementary}} exploration {{and practice of}} applying the theory and method of ecological footprint to assess regional ecological security. The ecological footprint from 1986 to 2002 and ecological security of three regions of Shaanxi Province of China were calculated and analyzed based on the theory of ecological footprint. Furthermore, the concept and model of ecological footprint pressure index (EFPI) {{as well as the}} grade system of regional ecological security was put forward based on ecological footprint so as to analyze the regional ecological security, and some measures to slow down the growth of the ecological footprint and maintain the regional ecological security were put forward at last. The following results were obtained. (1) It is feasible to analyze regional ecological security based on EFPI, which can reflect the degree of ecological security from two respects of carrying capacity and pressure. (2) Among 16 years from 1986 to 2002, the per capita ecological capacity in three regions appears to be a reducing tendency, the per capita ecological footprint shows an increasing tendency, the south of Shaanxi Province (SSP) is 12. 02 times of the north of Shaanxi Province (NSP) in the per capita ecological surplus. The per capita ecological deficit appears in the middle of Shaanxi Province (MSP). (3) Based on ecological footprint, ecological capacity from 1986 to 2002 in the three regions, the average EFPI in the three regions were calculated, the EFPI of NSP is 0. 8653, MSP is 1. 1291 and SSP is 0. 2103. According to the ecological <b>security</b> <b>grade</b> system measured off by EFPI and the average EFPI in the three regions, and considering the pressure human imposed on nature, the sequencing of the security degrees of three major regions is: SSP > NSP > MSP.

30|$|International {{conventions}} {{were noted}} {{by government officials}} as being the basis for how they approached safety: “ships are regulated by port authorities based on the rules of international conventions. For example, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) stipulates that the ships must follow traffic separation schemes to arrive and depart from the port”. Similarly, port operators highlighted the importance of following Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): “people in the port will follow SOP to operate. Vessel Traffic Control Section (VTCS) has its own SOP. For example, the pilot procedure (for entering the port) can not exceed 30 minutes. The time of ship leaving port can not exceed 20 minutes”. Further, that ship calling and existing times were all recorded and checked, which “is done to check the responsibility… if there is someone who cannot finish their job on time, it will affect the ship calling time and ship safety”. Otherwise, one government official noted that the International Ship and Port Facility (ISPS) had six categories and different <b>grades</b> of <b>security</b> risk: “if there is any risky situation, the port authority could prevent the ship’s calling and the ship would {{have the right to}} refuse to call at the port….when the ship has risky situation, it may raise the <b>security</b> <b>grade</b> (e.g. to grade two or grade one). There is a standard rule to regulate it”. Such risks could involve diseases, for example, “if the ship has visited an epidemic area before… and it is still during the incubation period when the ship comes… then the port authority will be very serious about checking this ship”. Regarding cargo, some regulations applied, for example “LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) ships must be regulated and be isolated by 500 meters in case of potential collision risk….also, when a chemical ship arrives to the port, the bow of the ship must face the outside of the port through the Turning Basin”.|$|R

40|$|Security {{assessment}} {{is crucial for}} the reliable and secure operation of power systems. This paper proposes a security level classification (SLC) method to analyze the security level of power systems both qualitatively and quantitatively. In this SLC method, <b>security</b> levels are <b>graded</b> according to a comprehensive safety index (CSI), which is defined by integrating the system margin index (SMI) and load entropy. The SMI depends on the operating load and the total supply capacity (TSC) under N- 1 contingency, and the load entropy reflects the heterogeneity of load distribution calculated from entropy theory. In order to calculate the TSC under N- 1 contingency considering both of the computational accuracy and speed, the TSC is converted into an extended conic quadratic programming (ECQP) model. In addition, the load boundary vector (LBV) model is established to obtain the capacity limit of each load bus, and thus detect potential risks of power systems. Finally, two modified practical power systems and the IEEE 118 -bus test system are studied to validate the feasibility of the proposed SLC method...|$|R
40|$|PhD (Education Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 In South Africa, the {{expansion}} of early childhood development was projected in White Paper 5 and Grade R was determined as the reception year. One condition for the achievement of objectives in Grade R is quality education, in which the teacher plays an irreplaceable role. How effective the Grade R teacher is {{in the performance of}} her work, however, depends amongst others on how she experiences her work-life and the extent of her security as a professional in the workplace. The paucity in research on the labour law position of the Grade R educator is due to the relative low status of employees in the early childhood development sector. Professional security was approached from a labour law perspective to start filling the knowledge gap in Education Law on the labour law position of the Grade R teacher with this modest contribution. The execution of policy forms {{an integral part of the}} Grade R teacher's employment conditions and determines to a great extent her daily task. This research answers the central research question: which roles do law and policy play regarding the professional <b>security</b> of the <b>grade</b> R educator? The research approach was qualitative-interpretivistic in nature and included observation of Grade R teachers' workplaces, as well as semi-structured interviews. A group of Grade R educators in the Matlosana and Tlokwe areas in the North West Province as well as principals and heads of department in the Foundation Phase were also interviewed. Other stakeholders such as parents as members of school governing bodies, members of teachers' unions and university lecturers were also participants in the research. Data generation on a smaller scale took place in Ontario, Canada, where the respective roles of law and policy regarding the Full-Day Early Learning Kindergarten programmes in professional security was investigated. All the data was used to understand and describe professional <b>security</b> of <b>Grade</b> R educators better, and generalisation was not the goal. The conclusion was reached that the theoretical underpinnings of the five legal disciplines that were used in creating a legal framework for professional security, were particularly relevant for the work-life of the Grade R participants in the study. Two psychologically oriented theories have also contributed to a deeper understanding of professional security. Although legislation, in principle, supports professional security, the extent to which participants had knowledge of relevant legislation or could apply legal principles to the workplace affected their professional security. Ignorance amongst policy-makers and employers about the nature and purpose of Grade R education leads to the underestimation of the Grade R domain, which negatively affects appointments, remuneration, conditions of service and policy implementation. Ignorance of the law also led to educator misconduct, and issues related to delictual liability emerged. Moreover, participants, due to ignorance, took the law into their own hands to create their own security in the workplace. Professional security emerged as a key issue in both ECD policy implementation and quality teaching. Finally a number of propositions were derived from the conclusions. Doctora...|$|R

The main distortion types in THz security images were first analyzed {{for the design of}} subjective evaluation criteria to acquire the mean opinion scores. Subsequently, the existing no-reference IQA algorithms, which were 5 opinion-aware approaches viz., NFERM, GMLF, DIIVINE, BRISQUE and BLIINDS 2, and 8 opinion-unaware approaches viz., QAC, SISBLIM, NIQE, FISBLIM, CPBD, S 3 and Fish_bb, were executed for the evaluation of the THz security image quality. The statistical results demonstrated the superiority of Fish_bb over the other testing IQA approaches for assessing the THz image quality with PLCC (SROCC) values of 0. 8925 (- 0. 8706), and with RMSE value of 0. 3993. The linear regression analysis and Bland-Altman plot further verified that the Fish__bb could substitute for the subjective IQA. Nonetheless, for the classification of THz security images, we tended to use S 3 as a criterion for ranking THz <b>security</b> image <b>grades</b> because of the relatively low false positive rate in classifying bad THz image quality into acceptable category (24. 69 %). Interestingly, due to the specific property of THz image, the average pixel intensity gave the best performance than the above complicated IQA algorithms, with the PLCC, SROCC and RMSE of 0. 9001, - 0. 8800 and 0. 3857, respectively. This study will help the users such as researchers or security staffs to obtain the THz security images of good quality.

40|$|Abstract. For {{ubiquitous}} communication self-organising adhoc networks {{become more}} and more important. We consider mobile phones as appropriate secure gateways to provide access to the Internet for external machines with low communication needs. A message-based approach is best in such a scenario with moving mobile phones and machines. In this paper we propose a security model for access control to the communication infrastructure, which is also message oriented. To meet the requirements of ubiquitously communicating machines, all algorithms on the sender’s side are based on symmetric cryptography resulting in low computation requirements. Our sophisticated symmetric key infrastructure for access control is based on unique combinations of keys and is completed with an effective key management. This results in a carrier <b>grade</b> <b>security</b> level although many parties share the same keys. Adopting the Subscriber Identity Module as a secure storage and computing module achieves the trustworthiness of the mobile phone.

We consider historical data covering the period 2002 – 2015, which enable us to assess interest rate sensitivity of assets during the development, the apogee, and {{the aftermath of the}} global financial crisis. Based on empirical evidence, both for investment and speculative <b>grades</b> <b>securities,</b> we find that the emerging market corporates exhibit two different regimes of sensitivity to interest rate changes. We observe switching from a positive sensitivity under the normal market conditions to a negative one during distressed phases of business cycles. This research sheds light on how financial institutions may approach interest rate risk management, evidencing that even plain vanilla portfolios of emerging market corporates, which on average could appear rather insensitive to the interest rate risk in fact present a binary behavior of their interest rate sensitivities. Our findings allow banks and financial institutions for optimizing economic capital under Basel III regulatory capital rules. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
