40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of {{multiscale}} seismic analysis of complex reflectors, that takes benefit from broad-band frequency range considerations, we perform a wavelet-based method to merge multiresolution seismic sources based on generalized Lévy-alpha stable functions. The frequency bandwidth limitation of individual seismic sources induces distortions in wavelet responses (WRs), and we show that Gaussian fractional derivative functions are optimal wavelets to fully correct for these distortions in the merged frequency range. The efficiency of the method is also based on a new wavelet parametrization, that is {{the breadth of the}} wavelet, where the dominant dilation is adapted to the wavelet formalism. As a first demonstration to merge multiresolution seismic sources, we perform the source-correction with the high and very high resolution seismic sources of the SYSIF deep-towed device and we show that both can now be perfectly merged into an equivalent seismic source with a broad-band frequency bandwidth (220 - 2200 [*]Hz). Taking advantage of this new multiresolution seismic data fusion, the potential of the generalized wavelet-based method allows reconstructing the acoustic impedance profile of the <b>subseabed,</b> based on the inverse wavelet transform properties extended to the source-corrected WR. We highlight that the fusion of seismic sources improves the resolution of the impedance profile and that the density structure of the <b>subseabed</b> can be assessed assuming spatially homogeneous large scale features of the <b>subseabed</b> physical properties...|$|R

We demonstrate the value of an original wavelet-based method and associated multiscale seismic attributes, applied to seismic data recently acquired on the western margin of the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard. From analysis in the wavelet domain, we recognize two types of gas-related reflections associated with submetre-scale distribution of gas. We identify a thin gas-charged layer associated with an apparent normal polarity reflection, and we detect gas patches associated with a reversepolarity bright spot with frequency-dependent elastic properties at small seismic wavelengths.

40|$|The full {{waveform}} inversion (FWI) of seismic reflection data aims {{to reconstruct}} a detailed physical properties {{model of the}} subsurface, fitting both the amplitude and the traveltime of the reflections generated at physical discontinuities in the propagation medium. Unlike reservoir-scale seismic exploration, where seismic inversion is a widely adopted remote characterization tool, ultrahigh-frequency (UHF, 0. 2 – 4. 0 kHz) multichannel marine reflection seismology is still most often limited to a qualitative interpretation of the reflections’ architecture. Here we propose an elastic FWI methodology, custom-tailored for pre-stack UHF marine data in vertically heterogeneous media to obtain a decimetric-scale distribution of P-impedance, density and Poisson’s ratio within the shallow <b>subseabed</b> sediments. We address the deterministic multiparameter inversion in a sequential fashion. The complex trace instantaneous phase is first inverted for the P-wave velocity {{to make up for}} the lack of low frequency in the data and reduce the nonlinearity of the problem. This is followed by a short-offset P-impedance optimization and a further step of full offset range Poisson’s ratio inversion. Provided that the seismogram contains wide reflection angles (> 40 °), we show that it is possible to invert for density and decompose a posteriori the relative contribution of P-wave velocity and density to the P-impedance. A broad range of synthetic tests is used to prove the potential of the methodology and highlights sensitivity issues specific to UHF seismic. An example application to real data is also presented. In the real case, trace normalization is applied to minimize the systematic error deriving from an inaccurate source wavelet estimation. The inverted model for the top 15 m of the <b>subseabed</b> agrees with the local lithological information and core-log data. Thus, we can obtain a detailed remote characterization of the shallow sediments using a multichannel sub-bottom profiler within a reasonable computing cost and with minimal pre-processing.

40|$|Offshore {{contractors}} seek {{to operate}} their {{remotely operated vehicles}} for the widest range of sea conditions where particularly launch and recovery through splash zone are critical phases in the offshore operation. The analytical methods for calculation of operational limit proposed by guidelines from DNV Recommended Practices may lead to an over-estimation of the hydrodynamic forces and consequently to an unduly restrictive operational limit. Accurate predictions of the hydrodynamic forces are important, {{and there is an}} opening in the regulations which allow the use of other analysis tools to determine the forces on the ROV system during launch and recovery. The main objective of the master thesis was to carry out splash zone analyses for DOF <b>Subsea’s</b> ROV system by use of DNV Recommended Practices and compare the results found by modeling the marine operation in the time domain simulation program SIMO. This involved a broad study of SIMO and a complete modeling of the offshore operation including calculation of the hydrodynamic data for the vessel Skandi Bergen and modeling of the ROV system. In SIMO, particularly the sea state of 4. 5 [m] significant wave height was investigated since this is the current operational limit for DOF <b>Subsea’s</b> ROV system. The investigation of operational limits by use of the analytical method and SIMO have shown that DNV Recommended Practices over-estimates the hydrodynamic forces acting in the wave zone leading to an restrictive operational limit in comparison to the time domain calculations in SIMO. The calculations by the analytical method have shown that the operational limit for launch and recovery of ROV should be limited to 2. 5 [m] significant wave height, while analyses in SIMO have shown that the current operational limit of 4. 5 [m] could be justified. However, it is seen that the possibility for slack umbilical is present in the sea state of 4. 5 [m] and peak periods in the range of T p = 6 – 9 [s]. It is also to be noted that the slack umbilical occurrences show a thoroughly dependency of the vessel heading. Furthermore, the snap loads induced by the slack umbilical occurrences are not found to be critical in the irregular wave analyses. This can justify the operational limit of 4. 5 [m] significant wave height as long as the weather is assessed by experienced personnel during deployment through wave zone and Skandi Bergen is positioned head sea. </p...|$|R

The most significant finding of this study deals with the storage of GTCC waste.

The liquefied CO 2 (LCO 2) to be sequestered is directly injected into <b>subseabed</b> geological formations through a flexible riser pipe using injection facilities contained onboard an LCO 2 carrier ship. The flexible riser pipe remains on the seabed, one end attached to the injection wellhead, until the other end is hoisted up and connected to the (dynamic positioning system (DPS) -controlled) LCO 2 carrier ship arriving at the ocean injection site.

Details of a pickup buoy system for retrieving the riser from the seabed and the structure of the flexible riser pipe are presented in this paper.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{discrete}} element model for simulating, at the grain scale, gas migration in brine-saturated deformable media. We rigorously {{account for the}} presence of two fluids in the pore space by incorporating forces on grains due to pore fluid pressures and surface tension between fluids. This model, which couples multiphase fluid flow with sediment mechanics, permits investigation of the upward migration of gas through a brine-filled sediment column. We elucidate the ways in which gas migration may take place: (1) by capillary invasion in a rigid-like medium and (2) by initiation and propagation of a fracture. We find that grain size is the main factor controlling the mode of gas transport in the sediment, and we show that coarse-grain sediments favor capillary invasion, whereas fracturing dominates in fine-grain media. The results have important implications for understanding vent sites and pockmarks in the ocean floor, deep <b>subseabed</b> storage of carbon dioxide, and gas hydrate accumulations in ocean sediments and permafrost regions. Our results predict that in fine sediments, hydrate will likely form in veins following a fracture network pattern, and the hydrate concentration will likely be quite low. In coarse sediments, the buoyant methane gas is likely to invade the pore space more uniformly, in a process akin to invasion percolation, and the overall pore occupancy is likely to be much higher than for a fracture-dominated regime. These implications are consistent with laboratory experiments and field observations of methane hydrates in natural systems. United States.
