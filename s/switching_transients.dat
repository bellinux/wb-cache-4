The system produces no <b>switching</b> <b>transients</b> and is not affected by system electrical harmonics (some harmonics can even be absorbed by {{synchronous condenser}}s). They will not produce excessive voltage levels and are not susceptible to electrical resonances. Because of the rotating inertia of the synchronous condenser, it can provide limited voltage support during very short power drops.|$|E

50|$|Different techniques, such as carrier {{lifetime}} control, {{injection efficiency}} and buffer layer devices, {{have been used}} to minimize turn-OFF <b>switching</b> <b>transient,</b> but all result in a trade-off between the ON-state loss and switching speed.|$|R
50|$|The example {{shown in}} the figure on the right {{illustrates}} a model-based FDI technique for an aircraft elevator reactive controller {{through the use of}} a truth table and a state chart. The truth table defines how the controller reacts to detected faults, and the state chart defines how the controller switches between the different modes of operation (passive, active, standby, off, and isolated) of each actuator. For example, if a fault is detected in hydraulic system 1, then the truth table sends an event to the state chart that the left inner actuator should be turned off. One of the benefits of this model-based FDI technique is that this reactive controller can also be connected to a continuous-time model of the actuator hydraulics, allowing the study of <b>switching</b> <b>transients.</b>|$|E
50|$|Morse code {{operators}} {{aspiring to}} the convenience and conversational fluency of Morse code QSK operation {{who plan to}} add external QSK T/R switches to their existing or planned radio transceiver setups should ensure that their receiver AGC circuitry has recovery times commensurate with the T/R <b>switching</b> <b>transients</b> to be expected and that the AGC circuits can operate quickly in the sub-millisecond range without creating noisy pops and static at the receiver audio output (speaker or headphones). Of particular note {{is that many of}} the modern so-called software defined radio (SDR) transceivers have particularly slow AGC functions because of the latency created by the extensive digital signal processing (A/D conversion, D/A conversion, digital filtering, digital modulation and digital demodulation) used for the SDR implementation. For these reasons, generally most SDR radios will not have the capability to operate QSK at the higher speed Morse code rates.|$|E
50|$|Audio {{frequency}} chokes (AFC) {{usually have}} ferromagnetic cores {{to increase their}} inductance. They are often constructed similarly to transformers, with laminated iron cores and an air gap. A major use in the past was in power rectifiers and direct current motor controllers to produce direct current (DC), where they were {{used in conjunction with}} large electrolytic capacitors to remove the voltage ripple (AC) at the output DC. A rectifier circuit designed for a choke-output filter may produce too much DC output voltage and subject the rectifier and filter capacitors to excessive in-rush and ripple currents if the inductor is removed. However, modern electrolytic capacitors with high ripple current ratings, and voltage regulators that remove more power supply ripple than chokes could, have eliminated heavy, bulky chokes from mains frequency power supplies. Smaller chokes are used in switching power supplies to remove the higher-frequency <b>switching</b> <b>transients</b> from the output and sometimes from feeding back into the mains input. They often have toroidal ferrite cores.|$|E

50|$|While most audio {{engineers}} {{are familiar with}} the A-weighting curve, which was based on the 40 phon equal-loudness contour derived initially by Fletcher and Munson (1933) the later CCIR-468 weighting curve, now supported as an ITU standard is less well known outside of the UK and Europe. Originally incorporated into an ANSI standard for sound level meters, A-weighting was intended for measurement of the audibility of sounds by themselves. It was never specifically intended for the measurement of the more random (near-white or pink) noise in electronic equipment, though has been used for this purpose by most microphone manufacturers since the 1970s. The human ear responds quite differently to clicks and bursts of random noise, and it is this difference that gave rise to the 468-weighting, which together with quasi-peak measurement (rather than the rms measurement used with A-weighting) became widely used by broadcasters throughout Britain, Europe, and former British Commonwealth countries, where engineers were heavily influenced by BBC test methods. Telephone companies worldwide have also used methods similar to 468 weighting with quasi-peak measurement to describe objectionable interference induced in one telephone circuit by <b>switching</b> <b>transients</b> in another.|$|E

40|$|There are {{numerous}} modeling approaches and algorithms for the simulation of high-voltage transmission networks with {{various degrees of}} accuracy and computational complexity. For the simulation of <b>switching</b> <b>transients,</b> the so-called Bergeron model {{is perhaps the most}} widely used approach as implemented in the renowned Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP). Therein, the transmission line is represented as forward and backward current waves implemented using standard queues with purely algebraic boundary equations. This representation is very efficient for the calculation of switching transients; however, it is inherently a fixed-time-step approach that is not conducive to the study of longer-term transient and dynamical phenomena such as the inter-area inertial oscillations that occur following major disturbances and can lead to transient instabilities. This restriction has led to a completely separate class of computer programs, i. e. transient stability programs, in which electromagnetic transients are completely neglected. In this thesis, a new transmission line modeling structure is set forth that is able to accurately portray the high-frequency <b>switching</b> <b>transients</b> but has a dynamically changing order and structure so that, after the fast <b>switching</b> <b>transients</b> subside, the lower-frequency phenomena can be simulated using a much larger and variable time step. It is argued that the resulting transmission line structure accurately portrays <b>switching</b> <b>transients</b> and, concurrently, is much more efficient than the Bergeron model when simulating long-term transients. The significance of the proposed transmission line modeling structure is that it obviates the need for separate computer programs that focus on specific time frames. ...|$|E
