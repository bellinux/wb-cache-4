50|$|Pulp {{produced}} by the kraft process is stronger than that made by other pulping processes and maintaining a high effective sulfur ratio or <b>sulfidity</b> {{is important for the}} highest possible strength. Acidic sulfite processes degrade cellulose more than the kraft process, which leads to weaker fibers. Kraft pulping removes most of the lignin present originally in the wood whereas mechanical pulping processes leave most of the lignin in the fibers. The hydrophobic nature of lignin interferes with the formation of the hydrogen bonds between cellulose (and hemicellulose) in the fibers needed for the strength of paper (strength refers to tensile strength and resistance to tearing).|$|E
30|$|Ultraviolet {{resonance}} Raman spectroscopy (UVRRS) {{was used}} to study the formation of aromatic and/or lignin-carbohydrate (LC) structures at the reducing end groups of O-alkyl-substituted cellulose under conditions simulating the initial phase of kraft pulping. The derivatives studied were methyl cellulose (MC) with degree of substitution (DS) of 1.64 – 1.95, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with DS ∼ 0.6, and a lignin model compound, creosol. The total alkali concentrations in the treatments were 0.1 M and 0.5 M and the <b>sulfidities</b> were 1 %, 10 %, and 30 %. HS− ions and creosol are both strong nucleophiles and they compete for the hot-alkali-generated unsaturated electrophilic reaction sites in the reducing end groups of the polysaccharides. The results indicated that conditions {{similar to those in}} the initial phase of conventional kraft cooking (high OH− and low HS− ion concentrations) increased the aromatic nature of the end groups and conditions similar to those in the initial phase of super batch cooking (low OH− and high HS− ion concentrations) partly inhibited the formation of aromatic and LC end groups.|$|R
40|$|In the kraft pulping process used {{to produce}} paper, the lignin, {{hemicelluloses}} and extractives in the wood are dissolved to free the cellulose fibers. A solution containing NaOH and NaSH is employed at 150 to 170 (DEGREES) C. A pressure sufficient to prevent the flashing of water and a residence time of approximately four hours are also necessary. Several types of reactors are currently used for carrying out these complex pulping reactions. The Kamyr digester is especially important. The reactors require associated operations such as heat transfer, washing of pulp and flow of both chips (or pulp) and liquors. Because of frequent process disturbances and long time delays, steady-state operation at optimum conditions {{is very difficult to}} attain. ^ The total value of shipments from paper mills is several billion dollars per year. A large economic return can therefore be obtained by improving the operation of digesters. The kinetic model of the kraft process developed in this investigation promises to be useful for process control and optimization, including the determination of the most economical operating conditions for batch and continuous digesters. It also can be a major aid to improve the understanding of pulping chemistry. ^ Laboratory batch data for pulping of four softwood species and three hardwood species were employed for development of the kinetic model. The temperatures, caustic concentrations and <b>sulfidities</b> used in these batch pulping investigations are broad and include the ranges of normal commercial values. The pulp yield and compositions, including lignin, cellulose, galactoglucomannan and araboxylan were predicted with excellent results. The liquor composition, including concentrations of alkali, hydrosulfide ions and dissolved solids was also predicted well. ^ The kinetic model was then adapted and employed to simulate the operation, of International Paper Company 2 ̆ 7 s Kamyr digester in Ticonderoga, New York using a lumped parameter approach. Good predictions were obtained for pulp K-numbers, liquor composition at the upper and lower heaters and liquor composition below the cooking zone for a total of 48 hours of digester operation. ...|$|R

40|$|The general {{objectives}} {{of this new}} project {{are the same as}} those described in the original proposal. Conventional kraft pulping technologies will be modified for significant improvements in pulp production, such as strength, bleachability, and yield by using green liquor, a naturally high, kraft mill-derived <b>sulfidity</b> source. Although split white liquor <b>sulfidity</b> and other high <b>sulfidity</b> procedures have the promise of addressing several of the latter important economic needs of pulp mills, they require considerable engineering/capital retrofits, redesigned production methods, and thus add to overall mill expenditures. Green liquor use, however, possesses the required high <b>sulfidity</b> to obtain in general the benefits attributable to higher <b>sulfidity</b> cooking, without the required capital constraints for implementation. Before introduction of green liquor in our industrial operations, a stronger understanding of its fundamental chemical interaction with the lignin and carbohydrates in US hardwood and softwoods must be obtained. In addition, its effect on bleachability, enhancement of pulp properties, and influence on the overall energy and recovery of the mill requires further exploration before the process witnesses widespread mill use in North America. Thus, proof of principle will be accomplished in this work and the consequent effect of green liquor and other high sulfide sources on the pulping and bleaching operations will be explored for US kraft mills. The first year of this project will generate the pertinent information to validate its ability for implementation in US pulping operations, whereas year two will continue this work while proceeding to analyze pulp bleachability and final pulp/paper properties and develop a general economic and feasibility analysis for its eventual implementation in North America...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Bamboo, {{as a kind}} of non-wood raw material, has a long, thin fiber {{with wide}} {{distribution}} and rich abundance in China. Its pulping properties are between softwood and hardwood. Adapting to the Chinese situation, developing bamboo pulp industrialization, according to the local conditions, is an available way to solve the shortage of fiber material for paper-making. Delignification of bamboo (Neosinocalamus) was carried out by conventional kraft and soda pulping under varying conditions to determine the relationships between selected cooking parameters (EA 14 ~ 20 %, <b>sulfidity</b> 0 ~ 40 %, maximum temperature 160 and 165 ℃, and time at maximum temperature 60 ~ 110 min) and pulp properties (kappa number and yield). Results indicated that in order to obtain relatively low kappa numbers(17 ~ 27), high sulfidity(20 ~ 40 %) at lower EA(14 ~ 16 %) increased pulp yield compared to the case of low sulfidity(0 ~ 10 %) at higher EA(16 ~ 18 %). Pulp with lower kappa numbers (13 ~ 15) and acceptable yield can be obtained at a <b>sulfidity</b> level of 20 ~ 30 % with 18 % EA or at a <b>sulfidity</b> level of 10 ~ 30 % with 20 % EA. Meanwhile, bamboo pulp in this condition not only helps to decrease kappa number in the subsequent oxygen delignification process, but also reduces the cost of chemicals in the bleaching process...|$|E

Pulping properties studied were pulp yield, total solids of the waste liquor, pH of the waste liquor, the hypo number test of the pulp, and such pulp strength properties as Concora crush strength, tensile, burst, tear, and stiffness. Chemical charge {{is the most important}} single variable affecting pulp yield, tensile strength, and Concora strength, whereas the <b>sulfidity</b> does not affect the pulp yield but does affect the tensile and Concora strengths. Cooking temperature, bark content, and chip size have less significant effects on pulp yields and pulp strength properties.

Properly prepared pulp fibers float in the column, stabilizing at the level where the mixed solvent density equals the density of the fiber. Because lignin is the lowest density component of pulp fibers and has the largest influence on fiber density, the column effectively separates fibers by lignin concentration and allows them to be counted and the distribution of lignin concentrations determined.

All species were submitted to cooking with the following reaction conditions: active alkali charge = 22 % (as NaOH); <b>sulfidity</b> index = 30 %; liquor/wood ratio = 4 / 1; time to temperature = 90 min; time at temperature (160 ºC) = 120 min. Acacia species show higher pulp yield than the E. globulus sample used as a reference and cooking selectivity is higher in the Acacia species investigated. The three pulps were beaten in a PFI mill at 500, 2500 and 4500 revolutions under a refining intensity of 3. 33 N/mm, and laboratory paper sheets were produced, including the unbeaten pulps, which made up 4 samples per species. The corresponding fibre characteristics in suspension were also determined. We used principal components analysis to investigate the differences in fibre characteristics and paper properties, {{as well as their}} interaction. Each value of these variables represents a mean of 10 tests, for the paper sheets. This methodology allowed us to determine how close, or how independent, the study variables were. We conclude there is a group of paper characteristics which depend strongly on each other - paper density, smoothness, tensile index, stretch, burst index, Schopper Riegler degree, internal cohesion and WRV – and are negatively correlated with the light scattering coefficient, opacity and brightness. On the other hand, intrinsic paper fibre resistance is strongly affected by fibre length and coarseness. On the basis of the properties we studied, it is clear that paper produced from Eucalyptus fibre has different properties from that produced from Acacia fibre. Papers produced from both species of Acacia are similar...|$|E

As polpações foram efetuadas em reatores tubulares de aço, usando-se madeira na forma de serragem nas seguintes condições: álcali ativo = 14 %, sulfidez = 25 %, relação licor / madeira = 10 L kg- 1 de madeira seca e temperaturas de 130, 150, 160 e 180 ºC durante tempos de 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 e 180 min. Após as polpações foram {{realizadas}} análises do rendimento bruto e de extrativos totais no resíduo (polpa + rejeitos). Foram determinados extrativos totais (álcool etílico-tolueno (1 : 2), álcool etílico e água quente, respectivamente) e extrativos solúveis em acetona. Os resultados mostraram que a maioria dos extrativos é degradada nos primeiros 30 min. do processo de polpação. Observou-se que a remoção ocorre em duas fases bem distintas: a primeira, rápida, quando a maioria dos extrativos é removida e a última, lenta, quando pequena fração dos extrativos é removida. The {{objective of}} this work was to study the kinetics of the removal ofEucalyptus grandis wood extractives during Kraft pulping. The pulping was done in steel tubular reactors using wood saw under the following conditions: active alkali = 14 %, <b>sulfidity</b> = 25 %; liquor-to-wood ratio = 10 L kg- 1 of dry wood; and temperatures of 130, 150, 160 and 180 °C during 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes. After pulping, analyses were conducted of the yield and extractives in residue (pulp and reject). Total extractives (ethyl alcohol-toluene (1 : 2), ethyl alcohol and hot water, respectively) and soluble extractives in acetone were analyzed. The results showed that most extractives are degraded in the first 30 minutes of the pulping process. It was observed that the removal occurs in two different stages: the first is rapid, {{where the majority of}} the extractives are removed, and the last is slow, where few extractives are removed...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion {{and stress}} {{corrosion}} cracking of structural components cost an estimated $ 300 billion annually in the United States alone and are a safety concern {{for a number of}} industries using hot alkaline environments. These process environments may contain different amounts of sulfide and chloride; however, the combined role of these ions on the {{stress corrosion cracking}} of duplex stainless steels, which are widely used because of their generally reliable performance, had never been studied. This study shows that chlorides in sulfide-containing caustic environments actually have a significant influence on the performance of these alloys. A mechanism for stress corrosion cracking of duplex stainless steels in hot alkaline environments in the presence of sulfide and/or chloride was proposed. Microstructural and environmental aspects were studied using mechanical, electrochemical, and film characterization techniques. The results showed that selective corrosion of the austenite phase depended on percent <b>sulfidity,</b> alkalinity, and chloride content. Chlorides enhanced crack initiation and coalescence along the austenite/ferrite phase boundaries. Unstable passivity of duplex stainless steels in hot alkaline-sulfide environments was due to anion adsorption on the surface leading to defective film formation. Chlorides and sulfide available at the electrolyte/film surface reduced the charge transfer resistance and shifted the response of the films to lower frequencies indicating the films became more defective. The surface films consisted of an outer, discontinuous layer, and an inner, barrier layer. Fe, Mo, and Mn were selectively dissolved in alkaline and alkaline-sulfide environments. The onset of stress corrosion cracking was related to the extent of selective dissolution and was consistent with a film breakdown and repair mechanism similar to slip-step dissolution. Recommendations for reducing the susceptibility of duplex stainless steels to stress corrosion cracking in sulfide-containing caustic environments include reducing the chloride to hydroxide ratio and alloying with less Mo and Mn. The results will impact the petrochemical, pulp and paper, and other process industries as new duplex grades can be developed with optimal compositions and environments can be controlled to extend equipment life.

40|$|MTCI/StoneChem {{developed}} a steam reforming, fluidized bed gasification technology for biomass. DOE supported {{the demonstration of}} this technology for gasification of spent wood pulping liquor (or 'black liquor') at Georgia-Pacific's Big Island, Virginia mill. The present pre-commercial R&D project addressed the opportunities as well as identified negative aspects when the MTCI/StoneChem gasification technology is integrated in a pulp mill production facility. The opportunities arise because black liquor gasification produces sulfur (as H{sub 2 }S) and sodium (as Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 }) in separate streams which may be used beneficially for improved pulp yield and properties. The negative aspect of kraft black liquor gasification is {{that the amount of}} Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } which must be converted to NaOH (the so called causticizing requirement) is increased. This arises because sulfur is released as Na{sub 2 }S during conventional kraft black liquor recovery, while during gasification the sodium associated Na{sub 2 }S is partly or fully converted to Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 }. The causticizing requirement can be eliminated by including a TiO{sub 2 } based cyclic process called direct causticization. In this process black liquor is gasified in the presence of (low sodium content) titanates which convert Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } to (high sodium content) titanates. NaOH is formed when contacting the latter titanates with water, thereby eliminating the causticizing requirement entirely. The leached and low sodium titanates are returned to the gasification process. The project team comprised the University of Maine (UM), North Carolina State University (NCSU) and MTCI/ThermoChem. NCSU and MTCI are subcontractors to UM. The principal organization for the contract is UM. NCSU investigated the techno-economics of using advanced pulping techniques which fully utilize the unique cooking liquors produced by steam reforming of black liquor (Task 1). UM studied the kinetics and agglomeration problems of the conversion of Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } to (high sodium) titanates during gasification of black liquor in the presence of (low sodium) titanates or TiO{sub 2 } (Task 2). MTCI/ThermoChem tested the performance and operability of the combined technology of steam reforming and direct causticization in their Process Development Unit (PDU) (Task 3). The specific objectives were: (1) to investigate how split <b>sulfidity</b> and polysulfide (+ AQ) pulping can be used to increase pulp fiber yield and properties compared to conventional kraft pulping; (2) to determine the economics of black liquor gasification combined with these pulping technologies in comparison with conventional kraft pulping and black liquor recovery; (3) to determine the effect of operating conditions on the kinetics of the titanate-based direct causticization reaction during black liquor gasification at relatively low temperatures ({le} 750 C); (4) to determine the mechanism of particle agglomeration during gasification of black liquor in the presence of titanates at relatively low temperatures ({le} 750 C); and (5) to verify performance and operability of the combined technology of steam reforming and direct causticization of black liquor in a pilot scale fluidized bed test facility...|$|E
40|$|Gasification {{of black}} liquor (BLG) has {{distinct}} advantages over direct combustion in Tomlinson recovery boilers. In this project {{we seek to}} resolve causticizing issues {{in order to make}} pressurized BLG even more efficient and cost-effective. One advantage of BLG is that the inherent partial separation of sulfur and sodium during gasification lends itself to the use of proven high yield variants to conventional kraft pulping which require just such a separation. Processes such as polysulfide, split <b>sulfidity,</b> ASAQ, and MSSAQ can increase pulp yield from 1 % to 10 % over conventional kraft but require varying degrees of sulfur/sodium separation, which requires additional [and costly] processing in a conventional Tomlinson recovery process. However during gasification, the sulfur is partitioned between the gas and smelt phases, while the sodium all leaves in the smelt; thus creating the opportunity to produce sulfur-rich and sulfur-lean white liquors for specialty pulping processes. A second major incentive of BLG is the production of a combustible product gas, rich in H 2 and CO. This product gas (a. k. a. “syngas”) can be used in gas turbines for combined cycle power generation (which is twice as efficient as the steam cycle alone), or it {{can be used as a}} precursor to form liquid fuels, such as dimethyl ether or Fischer Tropsh diesel. There is drawback to BLG, which has the potential to become a third major incentive if this work is successful. The causticizing load is greater for gasification of black liquor than for combustion in a Tomlinson boiler. So implementing BLG in an existing mill would require costly increases to the causticizing capacity. In situ causticizing [within the gasifier] would handle the entire causticizing load and therefore eliminate the lime cycle entirely. Previous work by the author and others has shown that titanate direct causticizing (i. e. in situ) works quite well for high-temperature BLG (950 °C), but was limited to pressures below about 5 bar. It is desirable however to operate BLG at 20 - 30 bar for efficiency reasons related to either firing the syngas in a turbine, or catalytically forming liquid fuels. This work focused on achieving high direct causticizing yields at 20 bars pressure. The titanate direct causticizing reactions are inhibited by CO 2. Previous work has shown that the partial pressure of CO 2 should be kept below about 0. 5 bar in order for the process to work. This translates to a total reactor pressure limit of about 5 bar for airblown BLG, and only 2 bar for O 2 -blown BLG. In this work a process was developed in which the CO 2 partial pressure could be manipulated to a level under 0. 5 bar with the total system pressure at 10 bar during O 2 -blown BLG. This fell short of our 20 bar goal but still represents a substantial increase in the pressure limit. A material and energy balance was performed, as well as first-pass economics based on capital and utilities costs. Compared to a reference case of using BLG with a conventional lime cycle [Larson, 2003], the IRR and NVP were estimated for further replacing the lime kiln with direct causticizing. The economics are strongly dependent on the price of lime kiln fuel. At $ 6 /mmBTU the lime cycle is the clear choice. At $ 8 /mmBTU the NPV is $ 10 M with IRR of 17 %. At $ 12 /mmBTU the NPV is $ 45 M with IRR of 36 %. To further increase the total allowable pressure, the CO 2 could be further decreased by further decreasing the temperature. Testing should be done at 750 C. Also a small pilot should be built...|$|E
40|$|O objectivo deste trabalho foi verificar o efeito do pré-tratamento da madeira por alta pressão para o cozimento kraft. Foi também estudado o efeito desse mesmo prétratamento no branqueamento e nas propriedades físico-mecânicas das pastas celulósicas. Para se atingir este objectivo sujeitou-se aparas de Eucalyptus globulus a um prétratamento hiperbárico de 400 MPa durante 30 minutos, procedendo-se à secagem ao ar livre e ao cozimento kraft com diferentes tempos de cozimento. Foi realizado um estudo sequencial (cozimento, branqueamento e propriedades físico-mecânicas) para um tempo de cozimento de 210 min nas condições pré-definidas, ou seja alcali activo, A. A., de 15, 2 %, índice de sulfureto, I. S., de 30, 8 % e hidromódulo de 4 L/kg. O pré-tratamento hiperbárico melhorou a aptidão para o cozimento kraft. Os resultados demonstraram que a pasta obtida apresentava um rendimento {{inferior}} à pasta padrão, mas conseguia-se retirar uma maior quantidade de lenhina durante o cozimento kraft. Isso foi demonstrado pelo valor do índice kappa, IK, sendo o IK de 17, 9 para o cozimento padrão e de 16, 9 para o cozimento A. P. com pré-tratamento hiperbárico pois durante o cozimento a difusão dos reagentes é mais fácil bem como a difusão dos produtos de degradação. Os valores da viscosidade foram praticamente iguais nos dois tipos de amostra, padrão e pré-tratada por alta pressão. Quando a pasta foi sujeita ao primeiro estágio do branqueamento, o IK reduziu-se em ambas as pastas, IK de 12, 3 para a pasta padrão e 11, 6 para a pasta A. P. Quanto à viscosidade, esta diminuiu com o branqueamento em ambas as pastas, existindo assim uma degradação parcial da pasta. Quanto aos valores de OXE, equivalentes de oxidação, estes mantiveram-se praticamente iguais nas duas pastas, o que nos indica que o efeito da alta pressão não influenciou o branqueamento, pois não se reduziu a quantidade de reagentes de branqueamento, ficando a estrutura fibrilar inalterada. Em relação às propriedades físico-mecânicas, estas foram avaliadas sem refinação para os dois tipos de pasta. Verificou-se que a pasta obtida do cozimento sujeito a pré-tratamento hiperbárico apresentou melhorias em algumas propriedades mecânicas, nomeadamente o índice de rebentamento e a rigidez. Existiu uma diminuição do índice de mão, tornando as fibras mais moldáveis devido à quantidade de lenhina diminuir. Os valores não são conclusivos para se saber se a alta pressão afectou as propriedades físico-mecânicas da pasta. The aim of {{the current}} work was to study the effect of high pressure wood pretreatment, previous to the kraft pulping. The influence of this pre-treatment, on the bleaching and physic-mechanical properties on the pulp, were also target of study. In order to accomplish these purposes, Eucalyptus globulus chips suffered a 400 MPa high pressure pre-treatment, during 40 minutes. After this procedure the wood chips were dried and suffered a kraft pulping process, with different time ranges of cooking. Considering the sample subjected to a 210 minutes pulping process, under predefined conditions, such as, 15, 2 % active alkali 30, 8 % <b>sulfidity</b> and a 4 L/kg hydromodule a sequential study (kraft pulping, bleaching and physical and mechanical properties) was applied. The high pressure treatment improved the kraft cooking. The attained results for the pulping, with the wood high pressure pre-treatment, resulted in an inferior pulp yield, but with higher lignin removal, comparing with a standard sample. The improved lignin removal was proved by the kappa number. For the standard pulp, the achieved kappa number was 17, 9 whereas for the pulp affected by the wood high pressure pretreatment, the kappa number was 16, 9. This improvement on the kraft pulping made {{by means of the}} already referred pre-treatment, {{can be explained by the}} easier diffusion of the reactants and resulting byproducts, during the pulping process. The viscosity values attained for both pulping procedures, with and without pre-treatment, where the same. Concerning the first stage of bleaching, the kappa number decreased in both cases, with and without pre-treatment, the kappa number for the standard pulp was 12, 3, while the pulp with the pre-treatment yielded a 11, 6 kappa number. As regards viscosity, this one decreased in both pulps, with the bleaching process. A partial degradation of the pulp was verified. The OXE, oxidation equivalent, values were kept nearly alike in both cases, which means that the high pressure did not affected the bleaching, leaving the fiber structure unchanged. The physical and mechanical properties were analyzed without refining, in both cases. The pulp pre-treated with the high pressure procedure, presented some improvements in some of these properties, namely the burs and stiffness. The bulk decreased, hence rendering more malleable fiber, due to the lower amount of lignin in the pulp. The values from the physical and mechanical tests were not conclusive as regards the effect of high pressure on the pulp's physical and mechanical properties. Mestrado em Engenharia Químic...|$|E
