2500|$|Angel pelargoniums {{are similar}} to Regal pelargoniums but more closely {{resemble}} P.crispum in leaf shape and growth habit. The majority of Angel cultivars originate from a cross between P.crispum and a Regal variety {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. Angels have grown in popularity in the last 30 years or so due mainly to an explosion of new varieties being released by <b>specialist</b> <b>nurseries</b> resulting from the work done by dedicated amateur hybridisers. These hybrisers have managed to obtain many new flower colour breaks and tighter growth habits resulting in plants suitable for all sorts of situations. Angels basically have the appearance of a small Regal with small serrated leaves and much smaller flowers and are more compact and bushy. The group extends to include similar small-leaved and -flowered types but usually with P.crispum in their parentage. They are mostly upright bush-type plants but there are some lax varieties that can be used for basket or hanging pot cultivation. Often called [...] "pansy-faced" [...] in the US. Some varieties have bicolour foliage. Other terms include ‘Langley-Smith Hybrids’.|$|E

50|$|This {{species is}} {{sometimes}} seen in <b>specialist</b> native <b>nurseries</b> in Eastern Australia; it grows well in part shade on well drained mildly acidic soils. {{it is less}} commonly grown than its better known relative S. sinuatus.|$|R
50|$|Hesperoyucca whipplei {{is used in}} xeriscaping in Southern California, but {{reportedly}} {{is difficult}} to grow outside of its native range (although it is widely available from <b>specialist</b> <b>nurseries</b> in the United Kingdom). It is extremely drought tolerant and thrives in clay soils.|$|E
50|$|Pink rock orchid {{is popular}} in {{cultivation}} and {{is relatively easy}} to grow. It needs to be grown on bark or fixed onto rock in a warm sunny position where the humidity is relatively high. It is available from <b>specialist</b> <b>nurseries</b> but it is illegal to collect specimens growing in the wild.|$|E
50|$|The {{species has}} only been brought in to {{cultivation}} in recent times and plants are not yet widely available beyond <b>specialist</b> <b>nurseries.</b> It exhibits a number of qualities which make it a suitable candidate for many gardens including adaptibility {{to a range of}} soil types, responsiveness to pruning, and resistance to heavy frost. Plants may be propagated from cuttings.|$|E
5000|$|Gardeners {{can reduce}} {{not only their}} food miles by growing {{some of their own}} food, but also their [...] "gardening miles" [...] by {{reducing}} the amount of plants and other materials they import, obtaining them as locally as possible and with as little packaging as possible. This might include ordering plants by mail order from a <b>specialist</b> <b>nursery</b> if the plants are sent out bare-root, reducing transport demand and the use of peat-based composts; or growing plants from seed, which will also increase genetic diversity and therefore resilience; or growing plants vegetatively from cuttings or offsets from other local gardeners; or buying reclaimed materials from salvage firms.|$|R
50|$|Notcutts Garden Centres Ltd. is {{a private}} limited company. The family-owned group {{operates}} 18 individual garden centres across England: 12 in the south east and 6 in the north west (formerly part of the NWF Group).

50|$|Metrosideros albiflora has a {{reputation}} for being exacting and difficult and is not common in cultivation. It is however available form <b>specialist</b> plant <b>nurseries.</b> In addition to the large white flowers, its new foliage is a reddish colour. It strongly prefers a situation where its base is afforded shade and it is not permitted to dry out excessively.|$|R
5000|$|A {{cultivar}} of {{this species}} known as [...] "Georgina Molloy" [...] is available in <b>specialist</b> <b>nurseries.</b> It has red flowers. Melaleucas can be grown from seed but Georgina Molloy must be grown from cuttings to keep its particular features. It is suited to temperate climates and required well-drained soil. (Georgina Molloy was an early settler and botanical collector.) ...|$|E
50|$|A {{garden centre}} is a retail {{operation}} that sells plants and related {{products for the}} domestic garden as its primary business. It is a development from {{the concept of the}} retail plant nursery but with a wider range of outdoor products and on-site facilities. It is now usual for garden centres to obtain their stock from plants which have been propagated elsewhere, such as by <b>specialist</b> <b>nurseries</b> or wholesalers.|$|E
50|$|The shoots {{are served}} like asparagus: steamed, {{with either a}} béchamel sauce or melted butter, salt and pepper. It is apt to get bruised or damaged in {{transport}} and should be eaten very soon after cutting, this may explain its subsequent decline in popularity. However, given a rich, deep and sandy soil, {{it is easy to}} propagate and grow on from root cuttings available from <b>specialist</b> <b>nurseries.</b> Blanching may be achieved by covering it with opaque material or using a deep, loose and dry mulch.|$|E
5000|$|The shrub is {{cultivated}} throughout Tucson, Arizona {{to attract}} butterflies. [...] It is also planted as an ornamental in Hawaii. The shrub is in commerce in France, sold by several <b>specialist</b> alpine <b>nurseries,</b> and {{was introduced to}} the UK in February 2013, with one small plant acquired by the Longstock Park Nursery, NCCPG national buddleja collection holders, and another by the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.Hardiness: USDA zone 7.|$|R
50|$|Metrosideros diffusa is {{not widely}} grown in cultivation, but is {{available}} from <b>specialist</b> native plant <b>nurseries</b> within New Zealand.

50|$|Burnley College is {{now much}} {{more focused on}} {{postgraduate}} research than in the past, specializing {{in areas such as}} green infrastructure, forest science, waterways ecology and management, environmental horticulture and has a significant soil science research group on campus. Facilities include a <b>specialist</b> library, plant <b>nursery,</b> field research and demonstration area, graphics studio, horticultural engineering facilities and plant tissue culture and genetics laboratories.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant is}} {{sometimes}} available for sale by <b>specialist</b> <b>nurseries.</b> Propagation is easy from seed {{although it may}} take a year to germinate. Seedlings are vigorous and thrive in semi-shade and prefer a fertile, free draining soil. Once they are established, plants do well in full sun. Cuttings are slow to strike. Male and female plants are required for the production of fruit to ensure that fruit are produced. In gardens, Elingamita johnsonii makes an excellent specimen tree for frost-free areas. It is highly sensitive to cold and intolerant of frost.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Royal Sovereign' {{was at the}} {{pinnacle}} of its popularity between the 1920s and the 1960s. Elizabeth II of the UK was served the variety at her coronation banquet. In the latter 20th Century, older strawberry cultivars fell out of favour commercially, displaced by modern varieties with longer shelf-lives, higher fruit yields and a better resistance to modern methods of transportation. Despite this, the variety is still highly prized amongst strawberry aficionados, and is still grown in small-scale cultivation, where flavour can take more precedence over yield quantity. The variety is still purchasable from <b>specialist</b> <b>nurseries.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although rare in nature, silky eremophila {{is often}} {{available}} in <b>specialist</b> <b>nurseries</b> with its popularity {{in part due}} to its soft, silvery-grey foliage and pale to deep blue flowers. A form with white flowers is also sometimes available. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock and opinion amongst horticulturalists differ on which is the better method. It will grow in most soils, is both drought and frost tolerant but needs to be grown in full sun. It benefits from regular pruning after flowering to preserve its shape and to help prevent fungal diseases.|$|E

50|$|The {{arboretum}} {{was established}} in 1871 by Christian Friedrich Gustav Freiherr von Berckheim (1817-1889), former Minister of State and Großhofmeister at the court in Karlsruhe, {{on the grounds of}} a baroque estate founded in 1725. His initial plantings were extensive - between 1872-1883 he planted some 12,494 trees on 36 hectares - with specimens purchased predominantly from <b>specialist</b> <b>nurseries</b> in Orléans, Ghent, and Exeter. Approximately 1460 sequoia trees were planted in this interval within a 2 hectare site. Although the climate has not proved entirely hospitable, and the original catalog of 150 species has subsequently dwindled to about 50, many mature specimens still remain, including original plantings of Calocedrus decurrens, Sequoiadendron giganteum, Pinus jeffreyi, Pinus ponderosa, and Thuja plicata.|$|E

5000|$|Bocking 14 is sterile, and {{therefore}} will not set seed (one of its advantages over other cultivars {{as it will}} not spread out of control), thus is propagated from root cuttings. The gardener can produce {{his or her own}} [...] "offsets" [...] from mature, strongly growing plants by driving a spade horizontally through the leaf clumps about 7 cm below the soil surface. This removes the crown, which can then be split into pieces. The original plant will quickly recover, and each piece can be replanted with the growing points just below the soil surface, and will quickly grow into new plants. When choosing plants to divide, ensure that they are strong healthy specimens with no signs of rust or mildew. When dividing comfrey plants, take care not to spread root fragments around, or dispose of on the compost heap, as each can re-root, and comfrey can be a very difficult plant to get rid of. Offsets can also be purchased by mail order from <b>specialist</b> <b>nurseries</b> in order to initially build up a stock of plants.|$|E
40|$|While {{only about}} 1 - 200 species are used intensively in {{commercial}} floriculture (e. g. carnations, chrysanthemums, gerbera, narcissus, orchids, tulips, lilies, roses, pansies and violas, saintpaulias, etc.) and 4 - 500 as house plants, several thousand species of herbs, shrubs and trees are traded commercially by nurseries and garden centres as ornamentals or amenity species. Most {{of these have}} been introduced from the wild with little selection or breeding. In Europe alone, 12 000 species are found in cultivation in general garden collections (i. e. excluding specialist collections and botanic gardens). In addition, specialist collections (often very large) of many other species and/or cultivars of groups such as orchids, bromeliads, cacti and succulents, primulas, rhododendrons, conifers and cycads are maintained in several centres such as botanic gardens and <b>specialist</b> <b>nurseries,</b> as are 'national collections' of cultivated species and cultivars in some countries. Specialist growers, both professional and amateur, also maintain collections of plants for cultivation, including, increasingly, native plants. The trade in ornamental and amenity horticulture cannot be fully estimated but runs into many billions of dollars annually and there is considerable potential for further development {{and the introduction of}} many new species into the trade. Despite this, most of the collections are ad hoc and no co-ordinated efforts have been made to ensure that adequate germplasm samples of these species are maintained for conservation purposes and few of them are represented at all adequately in seed banks. Few countries have paid much attention to germplasm needs of ornamentals and the Ornamental Plant Germplasm Center in conjunction with the USDA National Plant Germplasm System at The Ohio State University is an exception. Generally there is a serious gap in national and international germplasm strategies, which have tended to focus primarily on food plants and some forage and industrial crops. Adequate arrangements need to be put in place to ensure the long- and medium-term conservation of representative samples of the genetic diversity of ornamental species. The problems of achieving this will be discussed. In addition, a policy for the conservation of old cultivars or 'heritage' varieties of ornamentals needs to be formulated. The considerable potential for introduction of new ornamental species needs to be assessed. Consideration needs to be given to setting up a co-ordinating structure with overall responsibility for the conservation of germplasm of ornamental and amenity plants...|$|E
