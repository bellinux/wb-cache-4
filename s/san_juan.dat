5|$|Before Spanish {{colonization}} in the 1770s, the <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Creek watershed was {{inhabited by}} the Acjachemen or Juañeno Native Americans. The Juañeno were named by Spanish missionaries who built Mission <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Capistrano {{on the banks}} of a stream they named <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Creek. The watershed was used mainly for agriculture and ranching until the 1950s when residential suburban development began on a large scale. Since then, the human population has continued to encroach on floodplains of local streams. Flooding in the 20th and 21st centuries has caused considerable property damage in the <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> watershed.|$|E
5|$|Soils in the <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> {{watershed}} {{are mostly}} sedimentary rock and are highly erosive, resulting in large alluvial deposits along floodplains. Soil {{types in the}} <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> watershed {{can be divided into}} the Metz-San Emigdio, Sorrento-Mocho, Myford, Alo-Bosanko, Cieneba-Anaheim-Soper, and Friant-Cieneba-Exchequer associations, in order from low to high elevations. Steep hills in the <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> watershed are prone to collapse during heavy rainfall or seismic activity.|$|E
5|$|Between 2009 and 2013, {{extensive}} levee repairs {{were conducted}} along lower <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Creek. Construction closed the popular <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Creek bikeway for two years, inciting protests from many area residents who are frequent {{users of the}} path.|$|E

5|$|Second Lieutenant Carmen Lozano Dumler {{was born}} and raised in <b>San</b> <b>Juan,</b> Puerto Rico, where she also {{received}} her primary and secondary education. After graduating from high school, she enrolled in the Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing in <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> where she became a certified nurse in 1944. On August 21, 1944, she was sworn in as a second lieutenant and assigned to the 161st General Hospital in <b>San</b> <b>Juan,</b> where she received further training. Upon completing her advanced training, she was sent to Camp Tortuguero where she also assisted as an interpreter.|$|E
5|$|Ten more {{missions}} {{were founded}} in the Chiquitania by the Jesuits in three periods: the 1690s, the 1720s, and after 1748. In the 1690s, five missions were established: San Rafael de Velasco (1696), San José de Chiquitos (1698), Concepción (1699) and <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Bautista (1699). <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Bautista {{is not part of}} the World Heritage Site, and only the ruins of a stone tower survive near the present village of (<b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> de) Taperas.|$|E
5|$|The <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> {{watershed}} {{is home to}} sixteen major native plant {{communities and}} hundreds of animal species. However, the watershed is projected to be 48 percent urbanized by 2050. In addition, urban runoff has changed flow patterns in <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Creek and introduced pollutants to the river system. Although the main stem of <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Creek {{does not have any}} major water diversions or dams, some of its tributaries, including Trabuco and Oso Creeks, have been channelized or otherwise heavily modified by urbanization.|$|E

5|$|By 1918, the Army {{realized}} that there was a shortage of physicians specializing in anesthesia, a low salary specialty required in the military operating rooms. Therefore, the Army reluctantly began hiring women physicians as civilian contract employees. The first Puerto Rican woman doctor to serve in the Army under contract was Dr. Dolores Piñero from <b>San</b> <b>Juan.</b> She was assigned to the <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> base hospital where she worked as an anesthesiologist during the mornings and in the laboratory during the afternoons.|$|E

5|$|During the mid-1940s, various pro-independence groups, {{such as the}} Puerto Rican Independence Party, which {{believed}} in gaining the island's independence through the electoral process, and the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, which {{believed in}} the concept of armed revolution, existed in Puerto Rico. On October 30, 1950, the nationalists, under the leadership of Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos staged uprisings in the towns of Ponce, Mayagüez, Naranjito, Arecibo, Utuado (Utuado Uprising), <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> (<b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Nationalist revolt) and Jayuya.|$|E

5|$|In 1776, Father Junípero Serra founded Mission <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Capistrano {{on a site}} {{close to}} the creek (possibly near the Cañada Gobernadora confluence), and the creek was named after the mission. The first site was {{abandoned}} {{due to lack of}} water, although some historical accounts suggest the creek once had a perennial flow. The mission was moved to a second site in present-day <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> Capistrano, where it still stands. The Spanish referred to the Acjachemem as the Juañeno. The Spanish made the first recorded anthropogenic changes to hydrology in the <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> watershed, which included excavating irrigation channels, diverting water from streams, and channelizing and changing course of streams. Grazing animals introduced by Europeans, mainly cattle (and later sheep, after a drought decimated the local cattle ranching industry), consumed native grasses and left hillsides exposed and prone to erosion.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, severe floods {{caused by}} heavy rainstorms in the <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> {{watershed}} caused both <b>San</b> <b>Juan</b> and Trabuco creeks to overflow, destroying long {{sections of the}} concrete river banks near their confluence. The damage was attributed to severe erosion at the base which caused the concrete to lose support and crumble. A nearby residential community was threatened, but the floods receded before the levee collapsed and no serious harm was done. The failed sections were repaired with grouted riprap.|$|E
