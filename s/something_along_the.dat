500|$|The {{original}} {{story for}} this episode featured a non-lookalike female android who {{was intended to}} be a love interest for Data. The new android was intended to have been created as something that could be deployed into dangerous or hazardous situations, described in the premise as <b>something</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> lines of a female android version of Red Adair, the fire fighter. The [...] "evil twin" [...] story was suggested by Brent Spiner, instead, and was originally developed to include the creation of Data by an alien race. This was instead dropped and Dr. Noonien Soong was introduced. Soong was named by Gene Roddenberry after his Second World War friend, Kim Noonien Singh, who the character Khan Noonien Singh was also named after. It would be Roddenberry's final script credit on a Star Trek series. The script made mention of Isaac Asimov and the Laws of Robotics, something which had been suggested should be included {{at some point in the}} show as a spoken credit in a memo dated October 28, 1986 from executive producer Bob Justman. The episode suffered delays during pre-production caused by re-writes to the script, resulting in the script being switched with [...] "The Big Goodbye", which meant that director Joe Scanlan went on to direct that episode instead. Rob Bowman, who had previously been told by Justman that he was going to direct [...] "The Big Goodbye" [...] after his work on [...] "Too Short a Season", was instead assigned to direct [...] "Datalore".|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} production, {{what type of}} game it would be became crucial to whether Atlus or Fire Emblem {{developer}} Intelligent Systems would develop it. One {{of the problems that}} needed to be overcome was the form of the initial proposal, which was for a simulation game similar to Fire Emblem developed by Atlus. Atlus, who were better known for making traditional role-playing games, were unsure which series to emulate. The decision was eventually made to create <b>something</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> lines of a traditional RPG, so Atlus took on primary development. Their first concept {{turned out to be a}} grid-based strategy game with strategic positioning elements similar to Fire Emblem, but they were eventually convinced by Yamagami and staff from Intelligent Systems to keep within their own skillset rather than attempting anything radically different. The final product was visualized as a game only Atlus could make, incorporating elements from both series while standing as an original title that could be enjoyed by fans of both Shin Megami Tensei and Fire Emblem. The game's platform was chosen based on the recent successful Fire Emblem entries for the 3DS: as Fire Emblem had appeared on the 3DS, Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE was to be a different [...] "expression" [...] designed for the Wii U. During these early stages, proposals were also made for a 3DS version, but this never materialized. Despite its ultimate form, some of the conceptual ideas were taken from early plans for Fire Emblem Awakening to take place in a modern-day setting. The inclusion of a sharp symbol in the title, which represents a semitone increase in pitch of a note in musical notation, denoted the game's status as a unique hybrid of the two series. The inclination of the logo was also designed to represent the game's altered perspective on the Fire Emblem series. The game's cutscenes were created by Studio Anima and Studio 4°C.|$|E

2500|$|The name Ullevi itself {{consists}} of two parts.

2500|$|... banchi grossi ("great banks"): {{the largest}} {{financial}} institutions in Florence, {{though not the}} most numerous (only 33 in 1469 according to Benedetto Dei). They were the major movers and shakers in the European economy. They had vast accumulations of capital, multi-generational projects, and were a mainstay of the Florentine economy, because {{not only did they}} deal in time deposits, demand deposits, and discretionary deposits (deposits a discrezione), they expended most of their efforts in funneling their capital into commerce and bills of exchange. Such bills could be a hidden and legal method to create loans bearing interest. The Medici Bank was such a bank. One Medici branch manager (Tommaso Portinari) said: [...] "The foundation of the [...] business rests on trade in which most of the capital is employed." [...] Similarly, the articles of association frequently said <b>something</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> lines of the purpose for the partnership being [...] "to deal in exchange and in merchandise with the help of God and good fortune." [...] Under Cosimo, the Bank had interests in wool, silk, alum and merchant vesselsentirely separate from the many financial instruments and relations it managed. Despite their membership in the Arte del Cambio (assuming they bothered to run a local bank in Florence itself), these merchant banks' focus were determinedly international in scope, where profits could be found, local markets being very competitive. Sometimes these banks were referred to as gran tavoli ("big table") or variants thereof, due to their origins as banchi in mercato; the difference between them and banchi grossi was more one of degree than kind.|$|E
2500|$|The {{absence of}} any other combatants had bought Serapis a {{considerable}} amount of time. Bonhomme Richard’s gun decks were now so badly damaged that most of the British shots were passing straight through without touching anything, and the great guns were almost completely silenced. There were almost as many fires to be extinguished as there were aboard Serapis, but on the other hand, the hold was filling with water because one of the pumps was in ruins. Commodore Jones was exhausted, and apparently slumped on the chicken coop for a brief rest. Somehow (according to his later memoirs), a rumour went around that he was dead or dying, and his gunner and carpenter, both wounded, hastily consulted with the master-at-arms. Together they decided, a little before 10pm, to surrender by striking the ship’s colours, but the flag had already been shot away, so their only option was to shout. Captain Pearson shouted back, asking whether the Americans had really struck their colours. Possibly his Lieutenant of Marines relayed this message. Certainly, Jones’s reply was firmly negative. Jones himself recalled shouting <b>something</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> lines of [...] "I have not yet thought of it, but I am determined to make you strike," [...] at which point, presumably, the surrendering officers realised he was still very much alive and returned to their duties. A much more dramatic version appeared in newspapers within days of the event, allegedly based on the testimony of an ex-crewman who thought he heard something like [...] "I may sink, but I’ll be damned if I strike", and witnessed the captain using his pistols to shoot the three officers who were attempting to surrender ...|$|E
2500|$|In Paula A. Treichler's article [...] "Escaping the Sentence: Diagnosis and Discourse in 'The Yellow Wallpaper'", {{she places}} her {{focus on the}} {{relationship}} portrayed in the short story between women and writing. Rather than write about the feminist themes which view the wallpaper as <b>something</b> <b>along</b> <b>the</b> lines of [...] "[...] [...] the 'pattern' which underlies sexual inequality, the external manifestation of neurasthenia, the narrator's unconscious, the narrator's situation within patriarchy," [...] Treichler instead explains that the wallpaper can be a symbol to represent discourse {{and the fact that}} the narrator is alienated from the world in which she previously could somewhat express herself. Treichler illustrates that through this discussion of language and writing, in the story Charlotte Perkins Gilman is defying the [...] "[...] [...] sentence that the structure of patriarchal language imposes." [...] While Treichler accepts the legitimacy of strictly feminist claims, she writes that a closer look at the text suggests that the wallpaper could be interpreted as women's language and discourse, and the woman found in the wallpaper could be the [...] "[...] [...] representation of women that becomes possible only after women obtain the right to speak." [...] In making this claim, it suggests that the new struggle found within the text is between two forms of writing; one rather old and traditional, and the other new and exciting. This is supported in the fact that John, the narrator's husband, does not like his wife to write anything, which is the reason her journal containing the story is kept a secret and thus is known only by the narrator and reader. A look at the text shows that as the relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper grows stronger, so too does her language in her journal as she begins to increasingly write of her frustration and desperation.|$|E
