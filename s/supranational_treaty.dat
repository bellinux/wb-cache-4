Balancing {{the impact of a}} firm size and a credit rationing effect on the net credit position and aggregate pro-duction will help predicting the distribution of gains and losses among and within countries {{on the basis of a}} country’s aggregate wealth and its distribution. Altogether, the results contribute new explanations for some empirical puzzles. They also bear important implications for policy making, <b>supranational</b> <b>treaty</b> design and financial stability...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} my {{focus has been}} mainly on {{constitutional}} law in its cross-boundary concept and its relationship with that of national constitutions as how the constitutions of the nation-states {{are affected by the}} more comprehensive international and <b>supranational</b> <b>treaties.</b> I deal with the concepts of democracy, globalization, regimes collision, as well as international fragmentation of law in which constitutionalism {{plays a key role in}} trying to connect the different regimes. The other approach, of course, would be legal pluralism accepting the different regimes. The pivotal question would be how far constitutionalism has been successful in its global context; the obstacles and achievements. And, can EU be considered a successful constitutional framework as a regional and supranational institution? This thesis is trying to show the achievements of constitutionalism in a global context while urging for further cooperation in this regard in a global level...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} half of the twentieth century, {{international}} copyright protection has become of much greater concern as the copyright industry has become <b>supranational.</b> <b>Treaties</b> enacted in the last ten years such as the Berne Convention Implementation Act, the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, provide the highest copyright protection available at the international level. Global piracy has declined in the last several years because of these provisions. However, the adherence by the United States to these treaties has caused controversy; some maintain that it represents a major overhaul of federal law in many spheres, not only in copyright. So the adherence to these treaties by the U. S. has brought a clash of the two systems in the international copyright field - the copyright system and the author’s rights system. The author’s rights system (countries such as France, Germany, Italy, and most in Latin America) focuses almost exclusively on the individual creator - the author - while the common law system (countries such as the U. S. and the U. K.) focuses on the balance between the author’s property rights and the people’s right to learn. Along with the growth of international trade, an emphasis on natural law in the copyright field has emerged. These “Moral Rights” advocates claim that the copyright system in the U. S. does not sufficiently protect the personal, non-economic rights of the authors. This paper takes the position that the U. S. copyright system has made an effort for the past two centuries to accomplish a balance between the authors’ property rights and the people’s right to learn. However, this effort has been threatened by section 106 A of the Copyright Act which extends the scope of moral rights protection. This paper analyzes whether the inclusion of the moral rights doctrine in the U. S. statutory copyright system is unconstitutional...|$|R
40|$|National {{economic}} and social policies of European Union member states are restricted by international and <b>supranational</b> <b>treaties</b> and by effects of globalisation. Furthermore, in the European integration process many economic policy areas have been transferred completely or partly to EU. Under such circumstances, what is the future role of national economic systems? What could Social Market Economy contribute to European integration? The paper's thesis reads that national economic systems will maintain the basic function fostering a competition of ideas for further developing an open, competitive and social orientated European order. Institutional competition (or competition among systems) is helping to discover and test suitable concepts and institutional innovations for Europe. Contributions of Social Market Economy to EU's future {{economic and}} social system mainly {{can be seen in}} four areas. 1. A continuing intellectual and political dispute concerning concepts of interventionism and centralising in the European common market. With it, EUcitizens preferences for decentralising or centralising policy responsibilities should be acknowledged strongly. Principles of Social Market Economy - freedom, solidarity, subsidiarity - should be defended as guidelines for further European integration. 2. Strengthening and defending competitive order in Europe, which is far more than competition law. German contributions are, firstly, supporting a market model understanding competition as a normativefunctional order, incorporating freedom and efficiency elements. Secondly, stick to Germany's proposal setting up an independent cartel office on European level. 3. Defending the independence of the European System of Central Banks as guarantor for monetary stability. Having politically weakened the Stability and Growth Pact (1997) the principle of ECB's independence is becoming even more important. Requests for changing ECB's status and rising political pressure on ECB's Board of Directors should be rejected in order to develop a culture of stability. 4. The European Social Model should be compatible with opportunities for national competence in social policies. Following the principle of subsidiarity, EU members should have extensive competences institutionalising and financing their own social security systems. Institutional competition can be seen as an approach, open for learning from bestpractise-cases, as e. g. Denmark's flexicurity concept for labour markets. Competition among systems, arising from the existing - though restricted - national economic orders of EU member states, has the non-replaceble function discovering and controlling efficient concepts and institutional arrangements {{for the future of the}} European Union.

40|$|Democracy in Europe {{has a long}} {{tradition}} dating back to ancient Greece and Rome. It {{has its roots in the}} Middle Ages as well. Theoretical basis of democracy were established by such great thinkers as Marsilius of Padua, J. J. Rousseau, E. J. Sieyes or J. St. Mill. Representative democracy has been traditionally perceived in opposition to direct democracy, however, the political systems of modern states have far outweighed the balance in favor of representative (indirect) democracy, which is mainly determined by the territorial extent of a country, the size of the political community (the people) and the complexity of the matter of governance. The solutions included in the Polish Constitution of 1997 can serve as an example of the democratic standards of modern European countries. At the <b>supranational</b> level the <b>Treaty</b> on the European Union in its preamble explicitly refers to the inspiration of the European inheritance, which also include democracy, and confirms the affection to the principle of democracy. Article 2 of the Treaty enumerates the values on which the European Union is founded, including democracy as a common value to the Member States. However, a problem commonly referred to as "democratic deficit " can be recently noticed both at the European level and the level of Member States. The "democratic deficits " are counteracted in three ways- by strengthening the role of the European Parliament, by strengthening the role of national parliaments and through the instruments of participatory democracy. Key words: direct democracy, representative democracy, representative mandate...|$|R
