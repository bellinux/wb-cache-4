40|$|Immersive {{simulation}} is {{a staple}} of training for many complex system operators, including astronauts and ground operators of spacecraft. However, while {{much has been written}} about simulators, simulation facilities, and operator certification programs, the topic of how one develops simulation scenarios to train a <b>spacecraft</b> <b>operator</b> is relatively understated in the literature. In this paper, an approach is presented for using control theory as the basis for developing the immersive simulation scenarios for a <b>spacecraft</b> <b>operator</b> training program. The operator is effectively modeled as a high level controller of lower level hardware and software control loops that affect a select set of system state variables. Simulation scenarios are derived from a STAMP-based hazard analysis of the operator's high and low level control loops. The immersive simulation aspect of the overall training program is characterized by selecting a set of scenarios that expose the operator to the various inadequate control actions that stem from control flaws and inadequate control executions in the different sections of the typical control loop. Results from the application of this approach to the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission are provided through an analysis of the simulation scenarios used for operator training and the actual anomalies that occurred during the mission. The simulation scenarios and inflight anomalies are mapped to specific control flaws and inadequate control executions in the different sections of the typical control loop to illustrate the characteristics of anomalies arising from the different sections of the typical control loop (and why it is important for operators to have exposure to these characteristics). Additionally, similarities between the simulation scenarios and inflight anomalies are highlighted to make the case that the simulation scenarios prepared the operators for the mission...|$|E
40|$|Ground {{teleoperation}} of {{a satellite}} servicing spacecraft is a challenging task {{for a human}} operator, especially when there is significant communications delay between the control station and spacecraft. On-orbit operations are further complicated by a communications time delay between the ground and <b>spacecraft.</b> <b>Operator</b> performance can be improved {{with the use of}} a graphical simulation of the robot. By displaying the robot's commanded position, graphical simulation can also mitigate some effects of time delay.

A Fitts' Law experiment was designed to determine the effectiveness of the commanded display in reducing the impact of time delay.

Using the Automated Transfer Vehicle re-entry scenario, this study exploresthe limitations of such a concept by identifying and analysing system andscenario-related constraints. Although realisable, two major findings weremade evident. First, the transmittable data volume, though sufficient in thisscenario, is likely to be quickly exceeded in more data-intensive scenarios. Second, power consumption on a passive device is a major constraint forlonger duration missions.

A DSH-based development program has been initiated to develop and test the automation technologies necessary to support highly autonomous DSH operations. One such technology is a fault management tool to support performance monitoring of vehicle systems operations and to assist with real-time decision making in connection with operational anomalies and failures.

One of the more dire situations that can be encountered is the loss of pressure in the habitable volume of the spacecraft during on orbit operations. This is referred to as a cabin leak. This paper seeks to establish a general cabin leak response philosophy with the intent of educating future <b>spacecraft</b> designers and <b>operators.</b> After establishing a relative definition for a cabin leak, the paper covers general descriptions of detection equipment, detection methods, and general operational methods for management of a cabin leak. Subsequently, all these items are addressed {{from the perspective of the}} Space Shuttle Program, as this will be of the most value to future spacecraft due to similar operating profiles. Emphasis here is placed upon why and how these methods and philosophies have evolved to meet the Space Shuttle s needs. This includes the core ideas of: considerations of maintaining higher cabin pressures vs. lower cabin pressures, the pros and cons of a system designed to feed the leak with gas from pressurized tanks vs. using pressure suits to protect against lower cabin pressures, timeline and consumables constraints, re-entry considerations with leaks of unknown origin, and the impact the International Space Station (ISS) has had to the standard Space Shuttle cabin leak response philosophy.

40|$|Traditional {{satellite}} and launch control systems have consisted of custom solutions requiring significant development and maintenance costs. These systems have typically {{been designed to}} support specific program requirements and are expensive to modify and augment after delivery. The expanding role of space in today's marketplace combined with the increased sophistication and capabilities of modern satellites has created {{a need for more}} efficient, lower cost solutions to complete command and control systems. Recent technical advances have resulted in commercial-off-the-shelf products which greatly reduce the complete life-cycle costs associated with satellite launch and control system procurements. System integrators and <b>spacecraft</b> <b>operators</b> have, however, been slow to integrate these commercial based solutions into a comprehensive command and control system. This is due, in part, to a resistance to change and the fact that many available products are unable to effectively communicate with other commercial products. The United States Air Force, responsible for {{the health and safety of}} over 84 satellites via its Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN), has embarked on an initiative to prove that commercial products can be used effectively to form a comprehensive command and control system. The initial version of this system is being installed at the Air Force's Center for Research Support (CERES) located at the National Test Facility in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The first stage of this initiative involved the identification of commercial products capable of satisfying each functional element of a command and control system.

40|$|With {{improved}} technology, small satellites {{have opened}} space to customers such as universities conducting research, companies testing products, and countries unable {{to support a}} traditional large space program. As more small satellites operate in space, a theoretical concept of their capabilities is useful not only for satellite designers, but also current <b>spacecraft</b> <b>operators</b> and space situational awareness observers. This study examines the maximum communication capability of a S-band geostationary small satellite {{as part of a}} larger Small Satellite Capability Analysis study. Power production using body-mounted solar cells is maximized for cubic satellites with characteristic lengths from ten centimeters to one meter. The maximum data rate is calculated using link analysis and QPSK coding procedures. Multiple ground station sizes and allocated volumes for the transmitter are examined, and ideal conditions are used throughout the study. While the maximum data rate increases with satellite size and ground station antenna size, this procedure gives a “physics-only” solution that is far beyond the capabilities of current satellite components. Technological limits are applied to the solution to find the realistic maximum communication capability. A few general trends are apparent in the results. The input power required by the transmitter determines the minimum size satellite that can support a given transmitter. If only a small portion of the satellite volume is allocated for the transmitter, the transmitter volume also dictates the minimum size satellite that can support a given transmitter. The supported transmitter determines the output power and maximum bandwidth, which determine the resulting data rate. These limitations are the areas of technological development necessary to expand the future communication capability of small satellites. A trendline of allocated payload volumes based on satellite size is also developed to indicate the capability of the analyzed small satellite to accomplish other tasks. This is combined with the communication performance of satellites (with small transmitter-allocated internal volumes) to create a 3 -D solution space for the overall capability of small satellites...|$|R

When the number of gyros, N, is greater than 3, the 3 xN matrix, G, that reduces the N gyro measurements to three body-frame angular-velocity components cannot be fully determined by such methods; there are many such matrices that produce essentially the same angular velocity history. In such a case, <b>spacecraft</b> <b>operators</b> require information about the Nx 3 gyro linear response matrix, R, that relates gyro outputs to the body-frame angular velocities causing them. This matrix provides sufficient information to determine multiple reduced-dimension G-matrices for use in case of failure or degradation {{of one or more}} gyros, as well as to determine an optimal 3 xN G for the fully-functional configuration. A viable proposal is to apply a 3 xN pre-filter matrix, F, to the N gyro outputs before carrying out a conventional gyro calibration procedure. The angular-velocity history emerging from conventional calibration may then be used as input data, together with the same gyro data that generated it, to fit the alignment, scale-factor, and bias parameters of each gyro axis in turn. A difficulty of such a proposal is the arbitrariness in the choice of F. Due to gyro noise, different pre-filter matrices produce different calibrations. This paper presents a method of choosing F that is based on optimizing gyro consistency in the limit of infinite weight on gyro data, as compared to sensor data. The choice of F is independent of a priori alignment and is based on the gyro data alone. The method is applicable to any N of three or more, but reduces to conventional batch-estimation methodologies when N = 3. Results of computational comparison among calibration simulations using various choices of F will be presented for the Aqua gyro configuration with N = 4...|$|R

Experience indicates that integration impacts must be addressed to the satisfaction of both <b>spacecraft</b> builders and <b>operators</b> prior to the acceptance of new propulsion systems.
