This paper focuses on the issue of joint feature selection from the tensor data and proposes a novel method called joint tensor feature analysis (JTFA) for tensor feature extraction and recognition. In order to obtain a set of jointly sparse projections for tensor feature extraction, we define the modified within-class tensor <b>scatter</b> <b>value</b> and the modified between-class tensor <b>scatter</b> <b>value</b> for regression. The k-mode optimization technique and the L 2, 1 -norm jointly sparse regression are combined together to compute the optimal solutions. The convergent analysis, computational complexity analysis and the essence of the proposed method/model are also presented. It is interesting to show that the proposed method is very similar to singular value decomposition on the scatter matrix but with sparsity constraint on the right singular value matrix or eigen-decomposition on the scatter matrix with sparse manner. Experimental results on some tensor datasets indicate that JTFA outperforms some well-known tensor feature extraction and selection algorithms. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E

It is shown that the tilt β = 0. 27 (in the B–band) of the fundamental plane relation M/L ∝ L β {{can be understood as}} a combination of two effects: about 1 / 3 rd, that is ∆β = 0. 07 is a result of systematic variations of the stellar population properties with increasing luminosity. The remaining 2 / 3 rd, that is ∆β = 0. 2 can be completely attributed to non-homology effects which lead to a systematic change of the surface brightness profiles with increasing luminosity. Consequently, the observed tilt in the K–band (β = 0. 17) where stellar population effects are negligible is explained by non–homology effects alone.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Carbonate {{rocks are}} {{controlled}} by variable depositional systems and diagenetic process and have {{a wide variety of}} pore and grain shapes/sizes. Those characteristics imprint different petrophysical properties in carbonates, which are more difficult to predict than in siliciclastic rocks. Measurements on carbonates reveal that pore/rock type parameters are function of total porosity and {{play an important role in}} the relationship between porosity and P-wave velocity. In this research, the database consists of carbonate rock samples with a wide range of bulk porosities, pore types and rock textures, from different Brazilian areas in Southeast Continental Margin. We investigated the hypothesis that <b>scatter</b> <b>values</b> observed in velocity at a given porosity can be explained by pore types and pore shape characteristics. The quantification of pore shape/size distribution in each sample was based on four geometrical parameters from thin sections measurements – pore size, aspect-ratio, tortuosity and pore complexity.

The middle of each bin is named a data centre in the following. Six hundred and forty five (645) satellite data centres were created (Fig.  2). We averaged data recorded at the same epoch (within 1  day) in each bin, which provided values at the same geographic location at different epochs and different altitudes. A data centre thus can be considered similar to a geomagnetic repeat station, with the differences that the data might be measured at different altitudes between 300 and 380  km and that repeat intervals are not annual. The altitudes of the values in the same bin recorded at the same epoch were found to be very close (with an average <b>scatter</b> <b>value</b> of less than 10  m) so that no altitude correction was necessary before averaging. The altitude of the averaged value was taken as the average of altitudes of individual values in the bin recorded at the same epoch.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The current World Health Organization {{classification}} of myelodysplastic syndromes is based morphological evaluation of bone marrow dysplasia. In clinical practice, the reproducibility of {{the recognition of}} dysplasia is usually poor especially in cases that lack specific markers such as ring sideroblasts and clonal cytogenetic abnormalities. DESIGN AND METHODS: We aimed to develop and validate a flow cytometric score for the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome. Four reproducible parameters were analyzed: CD 34 (+) myeloblast-related and B-progenitor-related cluster size (defined by CD 45 expression and side scatter characteristics CD 34 (+) marrow cells), myeloblast CD 45 expression and granulocyte side <b>scatter</b> <b>value.</b> The study comprised a "learning cohort" (n= 538) to define the score and a "validation cohort" (n= 259) to confirm its diagnostic value. RESULTS: With respect to non-clonal cytopenias, patients with myelodysplastic syndrome had increased myeloblast-related cluster size, decreased B-progenitor-related cluster size, aberrant CD 45 expression and reduced granulocyte side scatter (P< 0. 001). To define the flow cytometric score, these four parameters were combined in a regression model and the weight for each variable was estimated based on coefficients from that model. In the learning cohort a correct diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome was formulated in 198 / 281 cases (sensitivity 70 %), while 18 false-positive results were noted among 257 controls (specificity 93 %). Sixty-five percent of patients without specific markers of dysplasia (ring sideroblasts and clonal cytogenetic abnormalities) were correctly classified. A high value of the flow cytometric score was associated with multilineage dysplasia (P= 0. 001), transfusion dependency (P= 0. 02), and poor-risk cytogenetics (P= 0. 04). The sensitivity and specificity in the validation cohort (69 % and 92 %, respectively) were comparable {{to those in the}} learning cohort. The likelihood ratio of the flow cytometric score was 10.

40|$|To {{assess whether}} grating-based X-ray {{dark-field}} imaging {{can increase the}} sensitivity of X-ray projection images in the diagnosis of pulmonary emphysema and allow for a more accurate assessment of emphysema distribution. Lungs from three mice with pulmonary emphysema and three healthy mice were imaged ex vivo using a laser-driven compact synchrotron X-ray source. Median signal intensities of transmission (T), dark-field (V) and a combined parameter (normalized scatter) were compared between emphysema and control group. To determine the diagnostic value of each parameter in differentiating between healthy and emphysematous lung tissue, a receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed both on a per-pixel and a per-individual basis. Parametric maps of emphysema distribution were generated using transmission, dark-field and normalized scatter signal and correlated with histopathology. Transmission values relative to water were higher for emphysematous lungs than for control lungs (1. 11 vs. 1. 06, p< 0. 001). There {{was no difference in}} median dark-field signal intensities between both groups (0. 66 vs. 0. 66). Median normalized scatter was significantly lower in the emphysematous lungs compared to controls (4. 9 vs. 10. 8, p< 0. 001), and was the best parameter for differentiation of healthy vs. emphysematous lung tissue. In a per-pixel analysis, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the normalized <b>scatter</b> <b>value</b> was significantly higher than for transmission (0. 86 vs. 0. 78, p< 0. 001) and dark-field value (0. 86 vs. 0. 52, p< 0. 001) alone. Normalized scatter showed very high sensitivity {{for a wide range of}} specificity values (94 % sensitivity at 75 % specificity). Using the normalized scatter signal to display the regional distribution of emphysema provides color-coded parametric maps, which show the best correlation with histopathology. In a murine model, the complementary information provided by X-ray transmission and dark-field images adds incremental diagnostic value in detecting pulmonary emphysema and visualizing its regional distribution as compared to conventional X-ray projections. ...|$|E

40|$|Self-calibration {{techniques}} for analyzing galaxy cluster counts utilize the abundance and the clustering amplitude {{of dark matter}} halos. These properties simultaneously constrain cosmological parameters and the cluster observable– mass relation. It was recently discovered that the clustering amplitude of halos depends {{not only on the}} halo mass, but also on various secondary variables, such as the halo formation time and the concentration; these dependences are collectively termed “assembly bias. ” Applying modified Fisher matrix formalism, we explore whether these secondary variables {{have a significant impact on}} the study of dark energy properties using the self-calibration technique in current (SDSS) and the near future (DES, SPT, and LSST) cluster surveys. The impact of the secondary dependence is determined by (1) the scatter in the observable–mass relation and (2) the correlation between observable and secondary variables. We find that for optical surveys, the secondary dependence does not significantly influence an SDSS-like survey; however, it may affect a DES-like survey (given the high scatter currently expected from optical clusters) and an LSST-like survey (even for low <b>scatter</b> <b>values</b> and low correlations). For an SZ survey such as SPT, the impact of secondary dependence is insignificant if the scatter is 20 % or lower but can be enhanced by the potential high <b>scatter</b> <b>values</b> introduced by a highlycorrelated background.

40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} in vivo the changes of the human lens autofluorescence (AF) with aging and cataractogenesis. Measurements were performed in the blue-green AF range (495 nm/ 520 nm) using a fluorometer designed, built and now clinically tested in our department. 43 random eyes of 43 healthy volunteers aged 6 - 86 years, five of each decade, were studied for effects of aging and 84 eyes of 84 patients with cortical, nuclear, posterior subcapsular or mixed lens opacities were studied for differences of various cataract types. The results were compared with the back light <b>scatter</b> <b>values</b> obtained by the commercially available Interzeag Lens Opacity Meter 701. Also AF and back light scatter of the lens were measured from 122 smoking males aged 57 to 76 years who participated in a cancer prevention study. The results were compared with the widely used subjective lens opacities classification system, LOCS III. In addition data was collected from 30 randomly chosen eyes of as many subjects {{with varying degrees of}} yellow-brown lens coloration in an otherwise healthy eye. We studied the influence of lens yellowing expressed by means of lens AF on visibility of retinal nerve fiber layer in black-and-white images. Lens AF profile consists of anterior and posterior peaks and a central plateau. The height of the anterior peak was used as a measure of the maximum AF value. The square root of the ratio between the posterior and the anterior AF peaks was used for estimating the lens transmission. Our technique was highly reproducible. The coefficient of variation was 3. 9 % for maximum AF and 2. 9 % for the lens transmission index. Both the maximum AF and light scatter were exponentially increased with age (r = 0. 95 and 0. 94, respectively; p < 0. 0001). According to the regression line of AF begins to increase in early childhood. It appears by extrapolation to be absent at birth. In contrast light scatter in the lens was present even in young children. The lens transmission for blue-green light, determined from the lens AF curve, was almost unchanging with age up to 60 years. Thereafter it decreased rapidly and the interindividual variation increased. In cataractous lenses the mean AF and <b>scatter</b> <b>values</b> differed statistically significantly from those of age matched healthy controls. The highest AF values were measured in nuclear cataracts where AF was also related to visual acuity and an increasing yellow-brown colour of the nucleus. About half of the total variation of the transmission index values could be accounted for by changes in nuclear colour as assessed by the LOCS III grading system. The transmission index provided a more precise prediction about nuclear colour and opalescence than age or light scatter did. In cortical cataracts the AF curve was low and flattened and the maximum AF value was significantly lower than in the age matched control eyes. The highest light <b>scatter</b> <b>values</b> were measured from cortical cataracts, but the correlation between LOCS III cortical grades and light <b>scatter</b> <b>values</b> was rather weak. Posterior subcapsular cataracts cannot be quantified either with AF or with light scatter measurements. Lens yellowing, expressed as lens AF, had an actual effect on retinal nerve fiber layer visibility. AF measurements provided a better prediction about the visibility score than age or visual acuity did.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{analysis}} of the transport of cosmic rays in a turbulent magnetic Ðeld that varies in all three spatial dimensions. The analysis utilizes a numerical simulation that integrates the trajectories of an ensemble of test particles from which we obtain diusion coefficients based on the particle motions. We Ðnd that the diusion coefficient parallel to the mean magnetic Ðeld is consistent with values deduced from quasi-linear theory, in agreement with earlier work. The more interesting and less under-stood transport perpendicular to the average magnetic Ðeld {{is found to be}} enhanced (above the classical scattering result) by the random walk, or braiding, of the magnetic Ðeld. The value of obtained isi Mgenerally larger than the classical <b>scattering</b> <b>value</b> but smaller than the quasi-linear value. The computed values of for a representation of the interplanetary magnetic Ðeld, are 0. 02 È 0. 04; these values arei...|$|R
