40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} choosing <b>split</b> <b>points</b> for continuous predictor variables in a decision tree. Previous approaches to this problem typically either (1) discretize the continuous predictor values prior to learning or (2) apply a dynamic method that considers all possible <b>split</b> <b>points</b> for each potential split. In this paper, we describe a number of alternative approaches that generate {{a small number of}} candidate <b>split</b> <b>points</b> dynamically with little overhead. We argue that these approaches are preferable to pre-discretization, and provide experimental evidence that they yield probabilistic decision trees with the same prediction accuracy as the traditional dynamic approach. Furthermore, because the time to grow a decision tree is proportional to the number of <b>split</b> <b>points</b> evaluated, our approach is significantly faster than the traditional dynamic approach. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{issue of}} {{detecting}} optimal <b>split</b> <b>points</b> for linear regression trees is examined. A novel approach called Turning Point Regression Tree Induction (TPRTI) is proposed which uses turning points {{to identify the}} best <b>split</b> <b>points.</b> When this approach is used, first, a general trend {{is derived from the}} original dataset by dividing the dataset into subsets using a sliding window approach and a centroid for each subset is computed. Second, using those centroids, a set of turning points is identified, indicating points in the input space in which the regression function, associated with neighboring subsets, changes direction. Third, the turning points are then used as input to a novel linear regression tree induction algorithm as potential <b>split</b> <b>points.</b> TPRTI is compared in a set of experiments using artificial and real world data sets with state-of-the-art regression tree approaches, such as M 5. The experimental results indicate that TPRTI has a high predictive accuracy and induces less complex trees than competing approaches, while still being scalable to cope with larger datasets...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Character {{segmentation}} (i. e. {{splitting the}} images of handwritten words into pieces corresponding to single letters) {{is one of the}} required steps in numerous off-line cursive handwritten word recognition solutions. It is also a very important step, because improperly extracted characters are usually impossible to recognize correctly with currently used methods. The most com-mon method of character segmentation is initial oversegmentation – finding some set of potential <b>splitting</b> <b>points</b> in the graphical representation of the word and then attempting to eliminate the improper ones.

40|$|Continuous K nearest {{neighbor}} queries (C-KNN) {{are defined as}} finding the nearest points of interest along an entire path (e. g., finding the three nearest gas stations to a moving car on any point of a pre-specified path). The result {{of this type of}} query is a set of intervals (or <b>split</b> <b>points)</b> and their corresponding KNNs, such that the KNNs of all points within each interval are the same. The current studies on C-KNN focus on vector spaces where the distance between two objects {{is a function of the}}ir spatial attributes (e. g., Euclidean distance metric). These studies are not applicable to spatial network databases (SNDB) where the distance between two objects is a function of the network connectivity (e. g., shortest path between two objects). In this paper, we propose two techniques to address C-KNN queries in SNDB: Intersection Examination (IE) and Upper Bound Algorithm (UBA). With IE, we first find the KNNs of all nodes on a path and then, for those adjacent nodes whose {{nearest neighbor}}s are different, we find the intermediate <b>split</b> <b>points.</b> Finally, we compute the KNNs of the <b>split</b> <b>points</b> using the KNNs of the surrounding nodes. The intuition behind UBA is that the performance of IE can be improved by determining the adjacent nodes that cannot have any <b>split</b> <b>points</b> in between, and consequently eliminating the computation of KNN queries for those nodes. Our empirical experiments show that the UBA approach outperforms IE, specially when the points of interest are sparsely distributed in the network...|$|R

It is empirically {{shown to be}} as accurate as a standard decision tree classifier, while being scalable for processing of streaming data on multiple processors. These findings are supported by a rigorous analysis of the algorithm’s accuracy. The essence of the algorithm is to quickly construct histograms at the processors, which compress the data to a fixed amount of memory. A master processor uses this information to find near-optimal <b>split</b> <b>points</b> to terminal tree nodes.

40|$|Abstract—After a {{power system}} is {{subjected}} to a blackout, par-allel restoration is an efficient means {{to speed up the}} restoration process. The system sectionalizing strategy consists of determining the proper <b>splitting</b> <b>points</b> to sectionalize the entire blackout area into several subsystems, so that parallel restoration can be carried out within the subsystems. For a large-scale power system, this system sectionalizing problem is quite complicated when considering black-start constraints, generation/load balance constraints, and voltage stability constraints. This paper presents an ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) –based system sectionalizing method, by which the <b>splitting</b> <b>points</b> can be found quickly. Simulation results on the IEEE 118 -bus test systems show that the method can successfully sectionalize the system into subsystems satisfying black-start constraints, generation/load balance constraints, and voltage stability constraints.

40|$|Controlled {{separation}} {{has been}} identified as one of the critical strategies to prevent a blackout of a bulk power system following a severe disturbance. To implement this critical strategy, optimal <b>splitting</b> <b>points</b> have to be identified subject to a series of steady-state and dynamic constraints. In this paper, a systematic controlled separation with three steps is proposed to cover steady-state and dynamic constraints with PMU measurements. At the first step, the power flow tracing method is employed to pre-determine the <b>splitting</b> <b>points</b> and establish rough islands. The buses cannot be covered at the first step will be analyzed with steady-state constraints at the second step. The last step will check the transient stability during the system separation with PMU measurements. The strategies with good steady-state and dynamic performance will be identified. A test system is shown to validate the proposed method. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
