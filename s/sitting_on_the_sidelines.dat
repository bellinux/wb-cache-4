25|$|This was {{a period}} of {{considerable}} boredom for many members of the squadron, and there was a rise in disciplinary problems during this time as the only outlet for the men’s physical energy was sport, training and mounting ceremonial duties. Finally, in May 1945, after almost a year <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sidelines,</b> the 2/6th received orders for overseas service.

These comments came at a time when Ireland's economy was beginning to falter, and with property prices falling by up to 10% as part of the Irish property bubble. Ahern later accepted responsibility for the overheating of the property sector but took no responsibility for the failings of the Central Bank of Ireland.|$|E

The injury was described as a [...] "devastating blow" [...] to the program by ESPN.com writer Eamonn Brennan. Chambers addressed the situation, saying, [...] "I have no doubt he will meet this challenge and will again be one of the top players in the nation," [...] in accordance to his potential fifth year of NCAA eligibility. Frazier redshirted the season shortly after it was announced by the school that he would undergo surgery. He said, [...] "I will never forget that game, that injury, never forget that camera.

He was guided by Penn State's athletic trainer, Jon Salazer, throughout the process.
