5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>John</b> Ostrom first {{described}} Sauropelta in 1970, {{it has been}} recognized {{as a member of}} the family Nodosauridae. The nodosaurids, along with the family Ankylosauridae, belong within the infraorder Ankylosauria. Nodosaurids are characterized by certain features of the skull, including the mandible (lower jaw), which curves downwards at the end. Overall, nodosaurids had narrower snouts than the ankylosaurids, and also lacked the heavy ankylosaurid tail clubs. Nodosaurids, like ankylosaurids, are found in North America, Asia, and Europe.|$|E

5|$|At the NCAA Outdoor Championships that year, he {{won three}} {{separate}} national titles, beating all {{opposition in the}} 100m, 200m, and 4×100 meter relay races. This achievement made him {{the first man to}} win the three races at an NCAA Championships <b>since</b> <b>John</b> Carlos did so in 1969. Dix's time of 9.93seconds in the 100m was a world-leader at that point of the season, and was just 0.01 behind Ato Boldon's NCAA record.

5|$|The 2006 {{season was}} {{statistically}} the best season of Federer's career, {{as well as}} one of the greatest seasons of any player in tennis history. In November 2011, Stephen Tignor, chief editorial writer for Tennis.com, ranked Federer's 2006 season as the second-greatest season of all time during the Open Era, behind only Rod Laver's Grand Slam year of 1969. Federer won 12 singles titles (the most of any player <b>since</b> <b>John</b> McEnroe in 1984) and had a match record of 92–5 (the most wins since Ivan Lendl in 1982).

5|$|Dix was {{a highly}} {{successful}} amateur athlete, setting a state record in the 100m and trying out for the US Olympic Team {{at the age of}} eighteen. He joined Florida State University and in his first year he broke the 100m American junior record and won at the NCAA Outdoor Championships. After a fourth-place finish at the 2005 US Championships, Dix continued with his collegiate success, setting an NCAA record of 19.69 seconds in the 200m and coming within one hundredth of the 100m record. He completed a 100m, 200m, and 4×100 meter relay sweep at the 2007 NCAA Outdoor Championships, the first to do so <b>since</b> <b>John</b> Carlos in 1969. He closed his amateur career in 2008: another NCAA 200m title made him the third most decorated track athlete in NCAA history, and he won gold and silver at the 2008 US Olympic Trials.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the very}} {{existence}} of the SPARTAN project and thus John's existence, was categorised as classified information. Many within the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), who were aware of this information, were strongly opinionated against the project, as the SPARTAN unit's proven versatility elevated them into direct competition with role-dedicated, established units. <b>Since</b> <b>John</b> emerged as the most exemplary Spartan from among the unit, he became the natural target of their sentiments. Antonio Silva, an officer from one such unit (ODSTs), exemplifies this attitude, and considers the Master Chief the freak product of an experiment that should never be repeated. Although the Chief resents Silva's dishonor to his fallen comrades' memory, he is also loyal to the chain of command, and remains quiet. Following the partial declassification of the SPARTAN project, John's heroic achievements caused the overall sentiment to lean in his favor. Despite these explorations of the character's personality, O'Connor {{said in an interview that}} revealing the face of the Chief is not as important as revealing the events going on around the character.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez did {{not stay}} in the bullpen very long though. After Randy Johnson {{strained}} his shoulder, Sánchez was chosen to start against the San Diego Padres on July 10. In that game, Sánchez not only threw the first complete game and the first shutout of his career; he threw a no-hitter, becoming the first Giants' pitcher to do so <b>since</b> <b>John</b> Montefusco no-hit the Atlanta Braves in 1976. In the process, Sánchez struck out a new career high of eleven batters. Sánchez had a perfect game going into the eighth inning, but an error by Juan Uribe allowed the only baserunner of the night. Sánchez almost lost the no-hitter during the ninth inning when Edgar Gonzalez hit a ball deep to centerfield. However, Aaron Rowand made a spectacular catch, and Sánchez got his no-hitter. Sánchez's no-hitter was also special because his father Sigfredo, who had never seen his son start a major league game, was in attendance.|$|E

5|$|The album's sales skyrocketed after Aaliyah's death. Before her death, {{its sales}} had been {{diminishing}} since the album's release in July {{and stood at}} more than 447,000 copies sold. News of her death was reported {{on the last day}} of Nielsen SoundScan's sales tracking week, during which Aaliyah sold 62,000 copies, a 41.5% increase from its past week's sales. The following week, it sold 305,500 copies and ascended from number 19 to number one on the Billboard 200. It was the record's highest sales week and marked the first time a recording artist climbed to number one posthumously <b>since</b> <b>John</b> Lennon in 1980 with his album Double Fantasy. It was also Aaliyah's only album to top any of Billboards charts. The record sold more than one million copies by September 19 and 2.06 million copies by February 25, 2002. In the US, Aaliyah spent 68 weeks on the Billboard 200 and, by December 2009, had sold 2.6 million copies.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} is regarded {{to have been}} the gravest threat to the Scottish kingdom <b>since</b> <b>John,</b> King of England's (d. 1216) northern campaigning and invasion in 1216. Although Óláfr's restoration on Mann was claimed as a success by the Norwegians, it was probably accepted gladly by the Scots as well; considering Óláfr's familial relationship with Alexander's protégé Ferchar and the consolidation of the Crovan dynasty after years of chaos. Óláfr consequently ruled the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles peacefully until his death, seven years later. At some point during his reign, he is known to have granted certain commercial rights and protections to the monks of the monastery of Holm Cultram. The chronicle states that he died on St Patrick's Isle on 21 May 1237 and was buried at St Mary's Abbey, Rushen. There is a possibility that a coffin-lid or grave-slab found at Rushen may be associated with Óláfr, or of two of his sons who are known to have been buried there (Rögnvaldr and Magnús).|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} of local prisons in locations such as castles had been criticised, <b>since</b> <b>John</b> Howard's {{work in the}} 1770s, and pressure for reform continued {{to grow in the}} 1850s and 1860s. Reform of the legislation surrounding bankruptcy and debt in 1869 largely removed the threat of imprisonment for unpaid debts, and in the process eliminated the purpose of the debtor's prisons in castles such as St Briavels. Efforts were made to regularise conditions in local prisons but without much success, and these failures led to prison reform in 1877 which nationalised British prisons, including prisons at castles like York. Compensation was paid to the former owners, although in cases such as York where the facilities were considered so poor as to require complete reconstruction, this payment was denied. In the short term this led to a 39% {{reduction in the number of}} prisons in England, including some famous castle prisons such as Norwich; over the coming years, centralisation and changes in prison design led to the closure of most remaining castle prisons.|$|E

5|$|Ulis {{opened the}} season in the {{starting}} lineup against the Albany Great Danes on November 13. On November 17, Ulis posted game-high and career-high 18 points as well as game-high 6 assists with no turnovers in 40 minutes of play in a victory over the defending national champion Duke Blue Devils in the Champions Classic.

In Kentucky's 2015–16 Southeastern Conference men's basketball season opener against the Ole Miss Rebels on January 2, Ulis posted 20 points and 10 assists. The game marked Ulis' first collegiate double-double and Kentucky's first 20-point and 10-assist performance <b>since</b> <b>John</b> Wall posted one on November 21, 2009. On January 5, Ulis posted his third straight 20-point performance with a career-high 23 points in a loss against the Ben Simmons-led LSU Tigers. On January 13, Ulis was among the 25 players included in the John R. Wooden Award Midseason Top 25 Watch List. On January 21, Ulis went 1415 from the free throw line and 23 on three-point shots to post 24 against Arkansas. Ulis was named to the January 25, 20-man Oscar Robertson Trophy midseason watch list.
