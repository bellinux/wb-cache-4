There is a solid sand-bar under it that is nearly as {{straight}} up and down as the side of a house. There is plenty of water close up to it, but mighty little on top of it.

60|$|The shower {{rushed over}} them again, shorter and less violent than the former one, but driving {{in most of}} the crowd, and only leaving on the quay the vicar, the steward, {{and a few of the}} most anxious fishermen. They could see nothing; for the dark <b>slanting</b> <b>line</b> of rain swept over the waves, joining {{together}} the sea and thick low cloud; and the roaring of the sea and moaning of the wind were fearful. No one spoke, till at last the black edges of the Shag loomed clearer, the moon began to glance through the skirts of the cloud, and the heaving and tossing of the sea, became more discernible.|$|E

40|$|The {{picture element}} (pixel) in {{conventional}} image sensors {{are placed in}} the form of a lattice for ease of implementation. Lattice placement of pixels intrinsically has directional singularity on the clarity of image representation, and the clarity is significantly dependent on the directions of the objects in the image. For example, horizontal lines are perfectly represented, while <b>slanted</b> <b>lines</b> have jagged edges. In this paper, we describe the CMOS image sensor with the pseudorandom pixel placement that solves the problem of the directional singularity on the clarity of image representation, as well as its evaluation in terms of the clarity of image representation for <b>slant</b> <b>lines.</b> © IEICE 2008...|$|R

[...] "Say we're here at north and the cove we're going to lies about south. Well, you get your sheets in flat--same as we have them now--and you sail up this way, at this angle to the wind." [...] He ran a <b>slanting</b> <b>line</b> across the circle until it touched the rim. [...] "That brings you here; then you come round, and go off at the same angle on the {{opposite}} tack, which brings you right up to the cove. You can do it in two long tacks, or--and it's the same thing--in a lot of little ones, each at the same angle to the wind; but how many degrees there are in that angle and when you get there depends on how your sails are cut and how smart you are at steering her." ...|$|E
60|$|He let {{the chain}} run, {{and watched it}} anxiously as it rattled out of the pipe. For a time it {{showed no sign of}} stopping, and then he felt a thrill as the harsh clanking slackened. The lower end had found bottom; but the vessel would soon lift a fathom or two, and he could not tell whether she would stop. The links ran slowly forward in a <b>slanting</b> <b>line,</b> and Jimmy saw by the absence of any {{splashing}} at the bows that she was still adrift. Then the rattle of the cable recommenced, which showed at least that there was more below, and she slowly stopped. In a few moments he felt her tug and strain, and white ripples broke angrily against the planking. She had either stopped or was drifting very slowly. Standing up on the cabin top, he waved his jacket that his comrades in the dory might see he was on board, and then went below out of the bitter wind. He could do no more.|$|E
60|$|Marston's waist {{was on the}} boom; {{his feet}} stuck out behind him, braced against the rope. In front there was a dark gulf. This was, no doubt, the hollow of the sail, and the indistinct <b>slanting</b> <b>line</b> above was the gaff. He threw a rope across the latter, but the end did not drop, {{so that he could}} seize it under the sail; the wind blew it out, {{straight}} and tight. He tried again, farther aft, jostling against the figure that looked faintly white, and leaning down across the boom, caught the end of the rope. The other man helped him and when they had got a loop round the end of the gaff he stopped for breath. He was shaky after the effort, his heart thumped painfully, and his chest rose and fell. He imagined other men were on the boom, but he and his companion were all that mattered. They must lash the peak down before the sail blew out again. When this was done, the others could master the distended folds.|$|E

5000|$|When {{applying}} R-diagrams to logic theory, logical statements p, q, and r can each {{become a}} line or multiple lines to visually display {{the validity of}} each element in a larger statement.

40|$|AbstractIn ancient Egyptian buildings, such as pyramids and pylons with {{inclined}} walls, {{the inclination}} was contrived {{to give a}} horizontal displacement measured in palms, half-palms or quarter-palms for a drop of one royal cubit of seven palms.

Evidence is presented suggesting that in two-dimensional art the obliquity of <b>slanting</b> <b>lines</b> may have been determined by a similar system, but with a drop of six units instead of seven. After {{the introduction of the}} squared grid, obliquity was probably controlled by reference to grid intersections.

50|$|Reed-Kellogg {{diagrams}} employ both {{of these}} modern tree generating relations. The constituency relation {{is present in the}} Reed-Kellogg diagrams insofar as subject, verb, object, and/or predicate are placed equi-level on the horizontal base line of the sentence and divided by a vertical or <b>slanted</b> <b>line.</b> In a Reed-Kellogg diagram, the vertical dividing line that crosses the base line corresponds to the binary division in the constituency-based tree (S → NP + VP), and the second vertical dividing line that does not cross the baseline (between verb and object) corresponds to the binary division of VP into verb and direct object (VP → V + NP). Thus the vertical and <b>slanting</b> <b>lines</b> that cross or rest on the baseline correspond to the constituency relation. The dependency relation, in contrast, is present insofar as modifiers dangle off of or appear below the words that they modify.|$|R
