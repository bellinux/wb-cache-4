It originally housed a forge and a foundry and its purpose was to manufacture and repair the machinery that would be used by the new mill buildings. In the loft of the building, an experimental full set of worsted wool machinery was put together and tested – worsted wool would become one of the signature products of the Lawrence manufacturing industry.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} be able to {{complete}} the composition without uninterruption, Wagner rented a small apartment in nearby Biebrich, just below the ducal castle on the Rhine. As a result, Weißheimer and Wagner were together almost every day. Weißheimer had become almost indispensable for Wagner, so, despite the 25 year difference in age, a warm friendship developed. Wagner's recurrent financial difficulties prompted Weißheimer to visit his father in order to request financial help for his friend. Johann complied. This was Wagner's first visit to the <b>Stone</b> <b>Mill.</b> He met Wendelin's parents, siblings, and last but not least, the [...] "wine" [...] on 1 June 1862. When he had to stay in bed a few weeks due to illness, Wagner paid a surprise visit to the <b>Stone</b> <b>Mill</b> to leave Wendelin the only copy of The Valkyrie for Wendelin's appreciation. In the garden pavilion by the lake shore, known as [...] "Richard-Wagner-house," [...] Wagner spent many hours boozing and proved to be a brilliant entertainer.

Days Mill was not an economic proposition by the 1880s, when railway transport allowed competition from surrounding mills and Melbourne mills, and roller technology displaced the old <b>stone</b> <b>mills.</b> The Day family did not make the transition to the expensive new roller mills developed in the 1870s and they simply stopped milling flour in the late 1880s.|$|R

He allowed Wendelin to study music, although this clearly contradicted his intentions of making Wendelin his estate's heir.|$|E
2500|$|Euro-American {{settlers}} {{first arrived}} in Powell Valley in the early 19th century.

2500|$|Weißheimer's {{background}} {{differed from}} other composers {{in that he}} did not come from a musical family. His father had intended him to inherit the <b>Stone</b> <b>Mill,</b> and thus he was sent to a secondary school in Darmstadt when he was only 13 as an apprentice. There, through his piano teacher, a member of the theater orchestra, he had an opportunity to listen to a rehearsal for the performance of Tannhauser. He had heard earlier parts of the music during a visit to a military concert. Weißheimer wrote that these experiences influenced him greatly. In his book: Experiences with Richard Wagner, Franz Liszt and many other contemporaries, he wrote: [...] "An unsuspected new world had risen for me, in fact." [...] Soon thereafter, in Darmstadt, Wendelin Weißheimer listened to the Lohengrin opera, and in Frankfurt to the Flying Dutchman, putting him into a Wagnerian delirium. In his final year in school Wendelin was introduced to music theory by theater conductor Louis Schindelmeisser. This so captivated him that he soon began to compose.|$|E
