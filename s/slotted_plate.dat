In the past several years, the <b>slotted</b> orifice <b>plate</b> has been evaluated for its performance as a single phase flow meter using air and as a two-phase flow meter using water and air. These previous studies have both shown superior performance to that of the standard orifice plate flow meter. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the <b>slotted</b> orifice <b>plate</b> two-phase flow meter with water and steam as the working fluids and compare this data with previous data taken from other test facilities to further develop the calibration of this new two-phase flow meter. Tests for repeatability will be shown for beta ratios of 0. 430, 0. 467, and 0. 500. Reproducibility will also be evaluated between a water and steam facility and three water and air facilities. This includes comparing data obtained using a set of brass <b>slotted</b> orifice <b>plates</b> and a set of stainless steel <b>slotted</b> orifice <b>plates.</b> The brass plates were tested in one water and air facility in a previous study and the stainless steel plates were tested using two phase data from air and water and also from steam and water. Differential pressure effects using water and steam as a mixture will be considered since there is a change in fluid quality as the fluid drops in pressure across an orifice plate. Reproducibility from six different data sets found using different facilities, different <b>slotted</b> orifice <b>plates,</b> and different working fluids were shown to converge to the same relationship. This relationship contained non-dimensional variables which included the calibration coefficient (KY= flow coefficient (K) multiplied by the expansion factor (Y)), the Euler number, and the beta ratio. These results were analyzed to develop a calibration for the <b>slotted</b> orifice <b>plate</b> two-phase flow meter which can ultimately be used to determine the flow rate of a two-phase mixture...|$|R

Micro stickies can be finely {{dispersed}} (100 µm - 100 nm), colloidal (100 - 10 nm) or molecularly dissolved (< 10 nm). Macro stickies are those which are retained as screening residue. The reason for this classification is that macro stickies are easy to remove from the deinked pulp during the deinking process by means of filtration.

The <b>slotted</b> <b>plate</b> on the lower photo accepts wedged holders which can be used to fasten the work to the plate. The plates were expendibles, so it was not unusual as shown in both photos for a machinist to drill additional holes in the plates for attaching work that could not otherwise be attached.

Installing the boards on the distorted surface requires distorting the g- 10 flange and the board which is glued to it to match the surface distortion and achieve a seal.

The visualization studied showed that the <b>slotted</b> orifice <b>plate</b> can be applied as a flow conditioner for two-phase flow in the pipe in many patterns flow. An existing pattern flow map based on the velocity of the each component in the mixture showed that the flow regime is a volumetric flow rate and gas volume fraction (GVF) dependant. Temperature affected the measurement results based on the mixture conductivity behavior. Using a combination of linearization technique and curve fit method, the effect of the temperature to the measurement results can be eliminated for GVF range from 2. 5 % to 97. 5 %. The slotted orifice characteristics were then investigated with using the calibration factor, Euler number, and Morrison number with respect to differential pressure and pressure of the mixture flow...|$|R
40|$|The <b>slotted</b> <b>plate</b> {{flow meter}} {{has been widely}} tested as an {{obstruction}} flow meter {{during the past several}} years. It has been tested for both single-phase flows as well as for two-phase flows. Previous studies have revealed that the <b>slotted</b> <b>plate</b> flow meter is always better in performance and accuracy than the standard orifice plate flow meter. This study is primarily based on how a <b>slotted</b> <b>plate</b> responds to horizontal two-phase flow with air and water being used as the working fluids. The plates under consideration are those with beta ratios of 0. 43 and 0. 467. Experiments have been performed with six different configurations of the <b>slotted</b> <b>plate</b> test sections. The performances of the <b>slotted</b> <b>plate</b> flow meters will be compared to that of a standard orifice plate flow meter and then with a venturi. The effects of varying the upstream quality of the two-phase flow on the differential pressure and the coefficient of discharge of the slotted plates, the standard orifice plate and the venturi will be evaluated. Response characteristics at low differential pressures will be investigated. Tests for repeatability will be performed by studying the effects of the gas Reynolds number and the upstream quality on the differential pressure. The differential pressures across the slotted plates, the standard orifice plate and the venturi will be compared. Reproducibility will be evaluated by comparing the data obtained from all six different configurations.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to find a}} model of the stagnation pressure loss resulting from flow through a <b>slotted</b> <b>plate,</b> which is effectively a cascade of flat plate airfoils, particularly at very large angles of incidence. Data from a published experiment is examined, and compared with control volume analysis, and CFD code calculations. An assumption that the loss can be separated into a transmission loss and an incidence loss seems to be justified by the data. Both the data and the CFD code results are consistent with an incidence loss model in which the flow component normal to the slot axis is lost. However, the experimental transmission loss is much larger than calculated values...|$|E

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} two-phase flow parameters {{has always been}} a key issue for many industries. Advancements in flow measurement techniques {{led to the development of}} multiphase flow meters which can measure it without separating it to individual phases. This technique is based on the homogeneous flow model which treats the two-phase flow as a single-phase flow at the homogenized location. It has been experimentally proven that a <b>slotted</b> orifice <b>plate</b> is a better flow homogenizer than a standard orifice plate and a V-cone. However, the location downstream of the <b>slotted</b> orifice <b>plate</b> where the two-phase flow becomes most homogeneous is still not known. Knowing this would help in accurate flow metering of the two-phase flow as the sensors (such as the electrical impedance sensor) can be placed at the most homogenized location. Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) is a non-invasive measurement technique that determines the conductivity distribution of the flow inside a pipe. The conductivity data can be used to determine concentration data by using the Maxwell?s equation. By analyzing the concentration distribution of the components in a two-phase flow at various locations, the optimum location downstream of the <b>slotted</b> orifice <b>plate</b> where the two-phase flow becomes most homogeneous for different flow conditions can be determined...|$|R

40|$|The {{response}} of <b>slotted</b> <b>plate,</b> Venturi meter and standard orifice {{to the presence}} of two phase, three phase and low differential flows was investigated. Two mixtures (air-water and air-oil) were used in the two-phase analysis while a mixture of air, water and oil was employed in the three-phase case. Due to the high gas void fraction (&# 945;> 0. 9), the mixture was considered wet gas. A <b>slotted</b> <b>plate</b> was utilized in the low differential pressure analysis and the discharge coefficient behavior was analyzed. Assuming homogeneous flow, an equation with two unknowns was obtained for the multi-phase flow analysis. An empirical relation and the differential {{response of}} the meters were used to estimate the variables involved in the equation. Good performance in the gas mass flow rate estimation was exhibited by the slotted and standard plates for the air-water flow, while poor results were obtained for the air-oil and air-water oil flows. The performance of all the flow meter tested in the analysis improved for differential pressures greater than 24. 9 kPa (100 in_H 2 O). Due to the tendency to a zero value for the liquid flow, the error of the estimation reached values of more than 500 % at high qualities and low differential pressures. Air-oil and air-water-oil flows show that liquid viscosity influences the response of the differential pressure meters. The best results for high liquid viscosity were obtained in the Venturi meter using the recovery pressure for the gas flow estimation at differential pressures greater than 24. 9 kPa (100 in_H 2 O). A constant coefficient Cd was used for the low differential pressure analysis and results did show that for differential pressure less than 1. 24 kPa (5 inH 2 O) density changes are less than 1 % making possible the incompressible flow assumption. The average of the computed coefficients is the value of Cd...|$|E

The weight can be varied in increments of 50 lb using <b>slotted</b> <b>plates</b> on a hanger. On the lower scale this reads up to 150 lb, and up to 1000 lb can be put onto the hanger.
