5|$|Some hemipterans {{are used}} to produce dyestuffs such as carmine (also called cochineal). The <b>scale</b> <b>insect</b> Dactylopius coccus {{produces}} the brilliant red-coloured carminic acid to deter predators.

5|$|The tree {{may also}} be {{attacked}} by the horse chestnut <b>scale</b> <b>insect</b> (Pulvinaria regalis) which sucks sap from the trunk and branches, but does not cause serious damage to the tree. Sometimes squirrels will strip the bark off branches, girdling the stem; as a result whole branches may die, leaving brown, wilted leaves.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{recorded}} visiting white-flowered plants {{include the}} Australian painted lady (Vanessa kershawi) and yellow admiral (V. itea), {{as well as}} bees. Field work in southern Tasmania showed that the introduced bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) sometimes robbed nectar by piercing {{the base of the}} tube. This then allowed honeybees (Apis mellifera) to retrieve nectar the same way. Epacris impressa is host to the <b>scale</b> <b>insect</b> Lecanodiaspis microcribraria.|$|E

5|$|Kermes {{is a red}} dye {{from the}} dried bodies of the females of a <b>scale</b> <b>insect</b> in the genus Kermes, {{primarily}} Kermes vermilio. Kermes are native to the Mediterranean region, living on the sap of the Kermes oak. They were used as a red dye by the ancient Greeks and Romans. The kermes dye is a rich red, and has good colour fastness in silk and wool.|$|E
5|$|Prickly pear cacti were {{introduced}} into Queensland, Australia as ornamental plants, starting in 1788. They quickly spread to cover over 25 million hectares of Australia by 1920, increasing by 1 million hectares per year. Digging, burning and crushing all proved ineffective. Two control agents {{were introduced}} to help control {{the spread of the}} plant, the cactus moth Cactoblastis cactorum, and the <b>scale</b> <b>insect</b> Dactylopius. Between 1926 and 1931, tens of millions of cactus moth eggs were distributed around Queensland with great success, and by 1932, most areas of prickly pear had been destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Research {{indicates}} the wasps use odor {{to identify and}} attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.

50|$|The Kermesidae are {{a family}} of <b>scale</b> <b>insects</b> {{belonging}} to the superfamily Coccoidea. The typical genus, Kermes, includes the kermes <b>scale</b> <b>insects,</b> from which a red dye, also called kermes (a.k.a. crimson), is obtained.|$|R

25|$|A pest which spreads through {{olive trees}} {{is the black}} scale bug, a small black <b>scale</b> <b>insect</b> that resembles a small black spot. They attach {{themselves}} firmly to olive trees and reduce {{the quality of the}} fruit; their main predators are wasps. The curculio beetle eats the edges of leaves, leaving sawtooth damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} pest that {{attacked}} orange {{trees in the}} United States was the cottony cushion scale (Icerya purchasi), imported from Australia to California in 1868. Within 20 years, it wiped out the citrus orchards around Los Angeles, and limited orange growth throughout California. In 1888, the USDA sent Alfred Koebele to Australia to study this <b>scale</b> <b>insect</b> in its native habitat. He brought back with him specimens of Novius cardinalis, an Australian ladybird beetle, and within a decade the pest was controlled.|$|E
25|$|Maitland became {{commanding}} officer of the sloop HMS Sparrowhawk on the North America and West Indies Station in June 1832 and brought home a treasure freight of $589,405 and 42 bales of cochineal (a <b>scale</b> <b>insect</b> from which the crimson-coloured natural dye carmine is derived) when he returned in May 1833.

30|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to provide new information about the hypogeal <b>scale</b> <b>insects</b> associated with coffee crops in Mexico. This plant is associated with many insects, among others, the <b>scale</b> <b>insects.</b> This group of insects are potential pests in coffee crops because they are exclusive phytophagous. Until now, there are more than 500 <b>scale</b> <b>insects</b> species recorded in Mexico, 19 of them in Chiapas State. The rhizosphere of the coffee plants contains high diversity of <b>scale</b> <b>insects</b> (Hemiptera: Coccomorpha) that have not been studied until now.

25|$|Remaining {{populations of}} the cactus can now be found in sandy scrub habitat. The {{remaining}} habitat is degraded with the overgrowth of invasive plant species such as love vine (Cassytha filiformis). While the cactus does not like full sun, it also cannot tolerate being shaded out by brush. Other threats to the plant have been all-terrain vehicles, herbicides, feral pigs, and hurricane damage from wind and falling branches. Populations have been vandalized with machetes. Cacti have died from being buried in sand, and have been stolen by cactus enthusiasts and collectors. A <b>scale</b> <b>insect,</b> Diaspis echinocacti, sometimes eats the stems of the cactus, and some sort of caterpillar has been noted to inflict some damage. Woodpeckers have been observed poking holes in the stems, which injures the plants. Most of the remaining populations are {{within the bounds of}} a state park, so their habitat is safe from development.|$|E
500|$|Cochineal {{is a red}} dye {{produced}} by a <b>scale</b> <b>insect</b> that lives on species of Opuntia. Long used by the [...] peoples of Central and North America, demand fell rapidly when European manufacturers began to produce synthetic dyes {{in the middle of}} the 19th century.

Before the development of aniline, alizarin, and other synthetic dyes, the insect was of great economic importance, although its use was in decline after the introduction of Mexican cochineal to Europe in the 16th century.|$|E

500|$|Cochineal (Dactylopius coccus) is a <b>scale</b> <b>insect</b> of Central and North America {{from which}} the crimson-coloured dye carmine is derived. It {{was used by the}} Aztec and Maya peoples. Moctezuma in the 15th century {{collected}} tribute in the form of bags of cochineal dye. Soon after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire cochineal began to be exported to Spain, and by the seventeenth century it was a commodity traded as far away as India. [...] During the colonial period the production of cochineal (in Spanish, grana fina) grew rapidly. Produced almost exclusively in Oaxaca by indigenous producers, cochineal became Mexico's second most valued export after silver. Cochineal produces purplish colors alone and brilliant scarlets when mordanted with tin; thus cochineal, which produced a stronger dye and could thus be used in smaller quantities, replaced kermes dyes in general use in Europe from the 17th century.|$|E
2500|$|The Armenian {{cochineal}} <b>scale</b> <b>insect,</b> Porphyrophora hamelii, is in {{a different}} taxonomic family from the cochineal found in the Americas. [...] Both insects produce red dyestuffs that are also commonly called cochineal.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cochineal}} ( [...] or [...] Dactylopius coccus) is a <b>scale</b> <b>insect</b> in the suborder Sternorrhyncha, {{from which}} the natural dye carmine is derived. A primarily sessile parasite native to tropical and subtropical South America as well as Mexico and Arizona, this insect lives on cacti in the genus Opuntia, feeding on plant moisture and nutrients. These insects are found on the pads of prickly pear cacti, then are brushed off and dried.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of coccinellid species are generally considered useful insects, because many species prey on herbivorous homopterans such as aphids or scale insects, which are agricultural pests. [...] Many coccinellids {{lay their eggs}} directly in aphid and <b>scale</b> <b>insect</b> colonies {{in order to ensure}} their larvae have an immediate food source. However, some species do have unwelcome effects; among these, the most prominent are of the subfamily Epilachninae (which includes the Mexican bean beetle), which are herbivorous themselves. Usually, epilachnines are only minor agricultural pests, eating the leaves of grain, potatoes, beans, and various other crops, but their numbers can increase explosively in years when their natural enemies, such as parasitoid wasps that attack their eggs, are few. In such situations, they can do major crop damage. They occur in practically all the major crop-producing regions of temperate and tropical countries.|$|E
