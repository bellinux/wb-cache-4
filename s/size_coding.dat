40|$|Abstract. Parallel {{programming}} is often {{regarded as one}} of the hardest programming disciplines. On the one hand, parallel programs are notoriously prone to concurrency errors; and, while trying to avoid such errors, achieving program performance becomes a significant challenge. As a result of the multicore revolution, parallel programming has however ceased to be a task for domain experts only. And for this reason, a large variety of languages and libraries have been proposed that promise to ease this task. This paper presents a study to investigate whether such approaches succeed in closing the gap between domain experts and mainstream developers. Four approaches are studied: Chapel, Cilk, Go, and Threading Building Blocks (TBB). Each approach is used to implement a suite of benchmark programs, which are then reviewed by notable experts in the language. By comparing original and revised versions with respect to source code <b>size,</b> <b>coding</b> time, execution time, and speedup, we gain insights into the importance of expert knowledge when using modern parallel programming approaches. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{embedded}} computing, <b>code</b> <b>size</b> is {{very important}} for system cost and performance. In global scheduling for VLIW/EPIC style embedded processors, region-enlarging optimizations, especially tail duplication, are commonly used to exploit instruction level parallelism (ILP) to boost the performance. The <b>code</b> <b>size</b> increase due to such optimizations, however, raises serious concerns about the affected I-cache, branch and TLB performance. In this paper, we focus on the <b>code</b> <b>size</b> efficiency of <b>code</b> <b>size</b> related optimizations in global scheduling. First, we propose to use the ratio of static IPC (instruction per cycle) changes to <b>code</b> <b>size</b> changes as a quantitative measure of the <b>code</b> <b>size</b> efficiency at compile time for any <b>code</b> <b>size</b> related optimization. Then, based on the <b>code</b> <b>size</b> efficiency of tail duplication, we propose the solutions to the two related problems: (1) how to achieve the best performance for a given <b>code</b> <b>size</b> increase, (2) how to get the optimal <b>code</b> <b>size</b> efficiency for any program. Our study shows that <b>code</b> <b>size</b> increase resulting from tail duplication has a significant but varying impact on IPC, e. g., the first 2 % <b>code</b> <b>size</b> increase results in 18. 5 % increase in static IPC, while the static IPC changes less than 1 % when given <b>code</b> <b>size</b> increase ranging from 20 % to 30 %. We then use this feature to define the optimal <b>code</b> <b>size</b> efficiency and to derive a simple, yet robust threshold scheme finding it. The experimental results using SPECint 95 benchmarks show that this threshold scheme finds the optimal efficiency accurately. While the optimal efficiency results show an average increase of 2 % in <b>code</b> <b>size</b> over original <b>code</b> <b>size,</b> the improved I-cache performance (4 % decrease in I-cache penalty for a 32 KB I-cache) is observed due to the increased locality.

The intra coding framework of HEVC follows that of traditional hybrid codecs and is built on spatial sample prediction followed by transform coding and postprocessing steps. Novel features contributing to the increased compression efficiency include a quadtree-based variable block <b>size</b> <b>coding</b> structure, block-size agnostic angular and planar prediction, adaptive pre- and postfiltering, and prediction direction-based transform coefficient scanning. This paper discusses the design principles applied during the development of the new intra coding methods and analyzes the compression performance of the individual tools. Computational complexity of the introduced intra prediction algorithms is analyzed both by deriving operational cycle counts and benchmarking an optimized implementation. Using objective metrics, the bitrate reduction provided by the HEVC intra coding over the H. 264 /advanced video coding reference is reported to be 22 % on average and up to 36 %. Significant subjective picture quality improvements are also reported when comparing the resulting pictures at fixed bitrate...|$|E

One mutant fibroblast line, previously shown to lack catalytic activity and antigenically cross-reacting material, contained no immunoprecipitable product. Analyses of immunoprecipitated polypeptides synthesized in vitro by cell-free translation of mRNAs prepared from selected mutants confirmed and extended the results from cell extracts.

Evidence is provided herein that this relatively low molecular weight product may be released from a larger precursor molecule of Mr 60, 000 - 80, 000. The precursor protein is confined to the cytosol of freshly isolated T lymphocytes, and only the Mr 12, 000 - 14, 000 moiety is released upon lectin stimulation. The precursor protein was subjected to limited tryptic digestion, which demonstrated that the biologically active fraction of the moiety resided in a relatively low molecular weight fragment. The T lymphocyte routinely possessed an intracytoplasmic pool of the precursor protein, the amount of which cyclically varied depending upon its depletion by the secretion process of a lower molecular weight product. Analysis of the mRNA <b>size</b> <b>coding</b> for the majority of B-cell growth factor activity, determined by translation in Xenopus laevis oocytes, suggested that the B-cell growth factor-specific mRNA resided in the greater than or equal to 15 S range.
