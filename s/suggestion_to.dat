He was also {{not a fan of}} the grappling aspects of MMA, but the UFC rebuffed his <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> change the rules of the sport to accommodate striking. Hecht credits Kevin Kay and his editorial collaboration with the UFC for highlighting the show's story lines, which he believes helped drive its ratings success.|$|E
5|$|His {{refusal to}} accept {{anything}} short of total victory was pivotal in the final outcome. His tenacity was well-paid {{with the news that}} López had died in battle on 1 March 1870, bringing the war to a close. PedroII turned down the General Assembly's <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> erect an equestrian statue of him to commemorate the victory and chose instead to use the money to build elementary schools.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{following}} a <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> Eastbourne Borough Council by Eastbourne Civic Society (now Eastbourne Society), a joint project {{was set up}} to erect blue plaques on buildings associated with famous people. The principles for selection are broadly those already established by English Heritage for such plaques in London. The first was erected in November 1994 in Milnthorpe Road at the former home of Sir Ernest Shackleton, the Antarctic explorer.|$|E

5|$|When the {{reconstruction}} of Denmark's capital was begun a number of changes were introduced. A commission was appointed to regulate the streets. After surveyings among the ruins this commission submitted a <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> create 12 to 15-metre wide main streets with 10-metre wide side streets {{with none of the}} surrounding houses being half-timbered.|$|E
5|$|American {{officers}} serving under Pulaski {{had difficulty}} taking orders from a foreigner who could scarcely speak English and whose ideas {{of discipline and}} tactics differed enormously from those {{to which they were}} accustomed. This resulted in friction between the Americans and Pulaski and his fellow Polish officers. There was also discontent in the unit over delays in pay, and Pulaski's imperious personality was a regular source of discontent among his peers, superiors, and subordinates. Pulaski was also unhappy that his <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> create a lancer unit was denied. Despite a commendation from Wayne, these circumstances prompted Pulaski to resign his general command in March 1778, and return to Valley Forge.|$|E

Thrilled with the new RV, Homer takes his family on an excursion. Driving on remote back roads and ignoring Marge's <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> turn back on the main road, the Simpsons find themselves teetering over a precipice. The family escapes the RV before it plummets over the cliff, leaving themselves stranded in the wilderness.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Oslo Sporveier again {{proposed}} {{closing the}} Ekeberg Line. This time {{the reason was}} {{the construction of the}} Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station, which would involve construction work around Jernbanetorget. This proposal also resulted in a public reactions, and the same arguments from the mid-1960s were repeated. Again the <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> link the Lilleaker Line to the Ekeberg Line were launched. Oslo Sporveier calculated it would cost NOK3.6 million for investments, including rebuilding 20 Gullfisk trams, new rectifiers and new tracks. This was less than the necessary 30 buses needed for conversion to bus services.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} {{trackage}} for cargo was increased, {{with a wide}} section of land mass being filled into the sea to create a larger rail and port facility at Brattøra, though the filling of {{a large part of}} the seabed to create artificial land. The railways allowed the transshipment of cargo from ships from Northern Norway to rail, as well as from rail from Central Sweden to ships to the British Isles. The port was supplemented by a new line to Ilsvika would allow the loading of ore there. The <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> build double track to Leangen was dropped.|$|E

5|$|The film company Toho {{approached}} Obayashi {{with the}} <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> {{make a film}} like Jaws. Influenced by ideas from his daughter Chigumi, Obayashi developed ideas for a script that was written by Chiho Katsura. After the script was green-lit, the film was put on hold for two years as no director at Toho wanted to direct it. Obayashi promoted the film during this time period until the studio allowed him to direct it himself. The film was a box office hit in Japan but received negative reviews from critics. House received a wide release in 2009 and 2010 in North America, where it received more favorable reviews.|$|E
5|$|The second torpedo struck Bismarck in her stern on {{the port}} side, near the port rudder shaft. The {{coupling}} {{on the port}} rudder assembly was badly damaged and the rudder became locked in a 12° turn to port. The explosion also caused much shock damage. The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> sever the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by Lütjens, as damage to the screws would have left the battleship helpless. At 21:15, Lütjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.|$|E

He transferred his flag to {{her because she was}} faster than his previous flagship. Cradock's command was transferred to the coast of South America later that month at his own <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> better hunt for the German ships preying upon British merchant ships. His ships were generally unsuccessful in this and he moved his squadron further south in late September to search for the East Asia Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee, in the vicinity of Cape Horn and the Strait of Magellan in accordance to his orders from the Admiralty.|$|E

Days later, his <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> bestow {{the winner of}} the NFL {{championship}} game with the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy was affirmed. In 1934, the Eagles finished with a 4–7 record, The Eagles' inability to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets, and his failure to sign a talented college prospect led him to adduce {{that the only way to}} bring stability to the league was to institute a draft to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent players. In 1935, his proposal for a draft was accepted, and in February 1936, the first draft kicked off, at which he acted as Master of Ceremonies. Later that month, his first child, Bert Jr., was born.|$|E
5|$|As the {{university}} grew, McMaster Hall started to become overcrowded. The <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> move {{the university}} to Hamilton was first brought up by a student and Hamilton native in 1909, although the proposal was not seriously considered by the university until two years later. By the 1920s, after previous proposals between various university staff, the Hamilton Chamber of Commerce launched a campaign to bring McMaster University to Hamilton. As the issue of space at McMaster Hall became more acute, the university administration debated {{the future of the}} university. The university nearly became federated with the University of Toronto, as had been the case with Trinity College and Victoria College. Instead, in 1927, the university administration decided to transfer {{the university to}} Hamilton. The Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec secured $1.5 million, while the citizens of Hamilton raised an additional $500,000 to help finance the move. The lands for the university and new buildings were secured through gifts from graduates. Lands were transferred from Royal Botanical Gardens to establish the campus area. The first academic session on the new Hamilton campus began in 1930. McMaster's property in Toronto was sold to the University of Toronto when McMaster moved to Hamilton in 1930. McMaster Hall is now home to the Royal Conservatory of Music.|$|E
5|$|Busch stopped {{painting}} in 1896 and signed-over all publication rights to Bassermann Verlag for 50,000 gold marks. Busch, now aged 64, felt old. He needed spectacles for writing and painting, {{and his hands}} trembled slightly. In 1898, together with his aging sister Fanny Nöldeke, he accepted Bassermann's <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> move into a large parsonage in Mechtshausen. Busch read biographies, novels and stories in German, English and French. He organized his works and wrote letters and poems. Most of the poems from the collections Schein und Sein and Zu guter Letzt were written in 1899. The following years were eventless for Busch. He developed a sore throat in early January 1908, and his doctor detected a weak heart. During the night of 8–9 January 1908 Busch slept uneasily, taking camphor, and {{a few drops of}} morphine as a tranquilizer. Busch died the following morning before his physician, called by Otto Nöldeke, came to assist.|$|E

5|$|Cetiosauriscus leedsi: In 1887, John Whittaker Hulke named a {{new species}} of sauropod, Ornithopsis leedsi. He {{designated}} BMNH R.1984–1988 as its type series, bones from the collections found by Alfred Nicholson Leeds. In 1905, Harry Govier Seeley made a <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> Arthur Smith Woodward, who took Seeley's advice and renamed O. leedsi, Cetiosaurus leedsi. Woodward also referred an additional specimen to the species, BMNH R.3078. The specimen was mounted and displayed {{for many years in}} the Dinosaur Gallery of the British Museum of Natural History (now the Natural History Museum) in London. An additional specimen, BMNH R.3706, referred to C. leedsi under the genus Cetiosaurus, includes some ribs, and may belong to a pliosaur. All referrals of C. leedsi outside of Ornithopsis are no longer accepted, and the species is thought to represent a new indeterminate brachiosaurid.|$|E
5|$|Dexter {{is called}} to a crime scene at the {{abandoned}} hospital where, last night, the Ice Truck Killer left security guard Tony Tucci (Brad William Henke) strapped to a table for Dexter to kill. Instead, Dexter had reported the crime scene and Tucci had been hospitalized after the Killer had amputated his hand and leg. Debra and Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) question Tucci when he wakes up in hospital, but Doakes is unimpressed with Debra's ways of extracting information from Tucci. He disapproves of her <b>suggestion</b> <b>to</b> blindfold Tucci to help him to remember his encounter with the Killer, but after she confronts him about his attitude toward her, he agrees to blindfold Tucci, who remembers that the Killer used throat lozenges. They return {{to the crime scene}} and find a lozenge wrapper, on which forensics expert Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee) finds a partial fingerprint.|$|E
5|$|On 23 October 1862, Otto of Bavaria, King of Greece was deposed in a bloodless coup. The Greeks {{were eager}} to have someone close to Britain and Queen Victoria replace Otto; some desired to allow Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh (her second son) succeed as King of Greece. He was elected with 95% {{of the vote in}} the Greek head of state {{referendum}} of 1862. After his ineligibility was confirmed however, the Greeks began looking for other possible candidates, which included Duke Ernest at the British government's <b>suggestion.</b> <b>To</b> their and Victoria's reasoning, if Ernest were to take the Greek throne, Alfred could immediately take up his inheritance and succeed Ernest as duke (the Prince of Wales having passed his claim to the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha onto his younger brother). Many were in favor of his nomination, including Prime Minister Lord Palmerston and Ernest's sister-in-law. In a letter written to her uncle Leopold I of Belgium, Victoria stated her support for a new royal branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (as Leopold had been chosen as King of the Belgians in 1831) as well as her desire for her second son Alfred to succeed his uncle in the duchy. As negotiations continued however, she began to lose enthusiasm for the idea.|$|E
