5000|$|In <b>semi-killed</b> <b>steel,</b> {{the aim is}} {{to produce}} metal free from surface {{blowhole}} and pipe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Semi-killed</b> <b>steel</b> {{is mostly}} deoxidized steel, but the carbon {{monoxide}} leaves blowhole type porosity {{distributed throughout the}} ingot. The porosity eliminates the pipe found in killed steel and increases the yield to approximately 90% by weight. <b>Semi-killed</b> <b>steel</b> is commonly used for structural steel with a carbon content between 0.15 and 0.25% carbon, because it is rolled, which closes the porosity. It is also used for drawing applications.|$|E
5000|$|During {{solidification}} of <b>semi-killed</b> <b>steel,</b> gas is {{evolved in}} the body of the ingot, tending to compensate in part or entirely for the shrinkage accompanying solidification.|$|E
5000|$|Since pipe {{cavities}} are minimized, <b>semi-killed</b> <b>steels</b> {{are usually}} cast in big-end -down molds without hot-tops.|$|R
40|$|Enbrittlement of steels {{outside the}} visible heat {{affected}} zone region due to plastic straining from the weldment and subsequent ageing has been reported by several authors. The problem is reviewed in this Note and an attempt made to detect this region in a <b>semi-killed</b> mild <b>steel</b> {{by means of a}} micro hardness testing survey taken at regular intervals in a direction away from the veld fusion boundary. Recommendations for future work in understanding the magnitude of this Problem particularly in multi stressed welded joints are given...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{tubular steel}} {{members and their}} connections are studied under ultimate tensile load conditions. Three end connection details are considered. These are practical connections, but one has a deliberately introduced defect of welding fabrication detail. Two types of steel are used: one is a conventional <b>semi-killed</b> mild <b>steel,</b> while {{the other is a}} rimmed steel that has been cold formed to produce an enhanced yield stress. The ratio of ultimate stress to yield stress (strain hardening ratio) is widely different for the two steels. The tests highlight the reduction in ultimate-load capacity and the severely reduced ductility that follows when defects of fabrication and low strain hardening ratio steels occur together...|$|R
50|$|The {{yield of}} rimmed and capped steel is {{slightly}} better than that of <b>semi-killed</b> <b>steel.</b> These types of steels are commonly used for sheet and strip metal because of their excellent surface condition. It is also used in most cold-working applications.|$|E
40|$|Structures {{representative}} of the visible weld heat-affected zone (HAZ) of a serai-killed C- Mn steel and a fully killed and normalised aluminium grain-refined C- Mn steel have been produced {{by means of a}} simulation technique. The Charpy V- notch imipact properties have been assessed and related to microstructure. The only significant deterioration in impact properties occurred in the coarse grained HAZ of the aluminium grain-refined steel. The notch- impact properties of the subcrltical weld HAZ have been assessed by simulating specimen blanks with and without notches through thermal cycles reported to cause the greatest degree of subcritical embrittlement in these steels. The results showed that no significant embrittlement occurred in either steel in the absence of notches. In the presence of a notch there was evidence of an increase in transition temperature of 10 35 C in the <b>semi-killed</b> <b>steel</b> but no increase in the aluminium grain-refined steel. The slight increase for the <b>semi-killed</b> <b>steel</b> was attributed to the presence of free nitrogen, which was absent in the aluminium grain- refined steel...|$|E
40|$|Static tensile {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on specimens of a rimmed steel and a <b>semi-killed</b> <b>steel</b> meeting ASTM A 7 re~uirements, a structural silicon steel (ASTM A 94), and a low alloy high tensile steel (ASTM A 242). The fabricated edge conditions used included machined edges, sheared edges, flame-cut edges, {{and in some cases}} flame-cut edges subse~uently flame softened. The flame-cut edges included both manual and guided flame-cut techni~ues. It is concluded from the tests that for all of the steels tested, the strength and the ductility of the machined edges is good. For all except the silicon steel, the strength and the ductility of the guided flamecut edges were also good. However, for the manual flame-cutting procedure...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of 1950 ’s vintage, A 285 Grade B carbon steels have been compiled for elastic-plastic fracture mechanics analysis of storage tanks (Lam and Sindelar, 1999). The properties are from standard Charpy V-notch (CVN), 0. 4 T planform Compact Tension (C(T)), and Tensile (T) specimens machined from archival steel from large water piping. The piping and storage tanks were {{constructed in the}} 1950 s from <b>semi-killed,</b> hot-rolled carbon <b>steel</b> plate specified as A 285 Grade B. Evaluation of potential aging mechanisms at both service conditions shows no loss in fracture resistance of the steel in either case. Site and literature data show that the A 285, Grade B steel, at and above approximately 70 °F, is in the upper transition to upper shelf region for absorbed energy and {{is not subject to}} cleavage cracking or a brittle fracture mode. Furthermore, the tank sidewalls are 1 / 2 or 5 / 8 -inch thick, and therefore, the J-resistance (JR) curve that characterizes material resistance to stable crack extension under elastic-plastic deformation best defines the material fracture toughness. The JR curves for several heats of A 285, Grade B steel tested at 40 °F, a temperature near the average ductile-to-brittle (DBTT) transition temperature (CVN @ 15 ft-lb), are presented. This data is applicable to evaluate flaw stability of the storage tanks that are operated above 70 °F since, even at 40 °F, crack advance is observed to proceed by ductile tearing...|$|R
40|$|Static tensile {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on specimens of a rimmed steel and a <b>semi-killed</b> <b>steel</b> meeting ASTM A 7 requirements, a structural silicon steel (ASTM A 94), and a low alloy high tensile steel (ASTM A 242). The fabricated edge conditions used included machined edges, sheared edges, flame-cut edges, {{and in some cases}} flame-cut edges subse~uently flame softened. The flame-cut edges included both manual and guided flame-cut techniques. It is concluded from the tests that for all of the steels tested, the strength and the ductility of the machined edges is good. For all except the silicon steel, the strength and the ductility of the guided flamecut edges were also good. However, for the manual flame-cutting procedure, there was in some cases serious impairment of the physical properties. Even the automatic flame cutting impaired the properties of the silicon steel, but the ductility and strength were restored by subsequent appropriate flame softening of the edge. The sheared edge impaired the ductility of all of the steels tested. The greatest loss in ductility was caused in the <b>semi-killed</b> <b>steel</b> where the maximum strength also was reduced, in some instances falling as low as the yield strength. The harmful effect of the sheared edge on the ductility was apparently eliminated by a subsequent flame softening treatment. The strength and the ductility were increased to practically the same values as those of the same steel with machined edges. Only under the most damaging edge conditions was the strength at a brittle fracture as low as the yield point. With the better methods of edge preparation, the strength was considerably above the yield point and approached the usual ultimate strength of the material.
