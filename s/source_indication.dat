40|$|Technology {{increasingly}} {{allows for}} digital {{distribution of goods}} that once might once have been offered in physical form, radically separating the design and production processes. That separation has potentially destabilizing consequences for trademark law, which overwhelmingly has been oriented toward indications {{of the origin of}} physical goods. For one thing, digitization brings much more of trademark law into contact with the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s Dastar decision, raising difficult questions about whether, and under what circumstances, digital files count as “goods” for Lanham Act purposes. More broadly, a world of increasing digitization implicates concerns about the boundaries of trademark law vis-à-vis other areas of IP law, and it raises profound questions about the meaning of <b>source</b> <b>indication</b> and the role of trademark law in the digital world. We argue that the question of whether we should treat digital files as relevant goods is irreducibly one of policy, and it should not be reduced to mere formalism. Digital files should be treated as goods only when consumers’ interactions with the files sufficiently resemble their interactions with physical goods that they warrant the same treatment. In particular, we argue that digital files should be treated as goods only when the origin of the files as such (not the content of those files) is material to consumers. That, we argue, {{may turn out to be}} relatively rare. Indeed, we suggest that a world of greater digitization might well be a world in which trademark law has less relevance relative to design patent and copyright...|$|E

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{a comprehensive}} study of available methods for locating voltage sag sources in power systems. The performance of four sag source location methods is analyzed by simulating faults in a Brazilian transmission network using PSCAD/EMTDC. The most reliable methods (distance relay, reactive power and slope of system trajectory) were then applied to a case study on a Zambian utilityindustrial customer interface to assess the vulnerability {{of one of the}} latter’s critical induction motors to voltage sags. It is shown that the sensitive load at Indeni is vulnerable to voltage sags arising from faults in both the CEC and Zesco networks, the two utilities that handle power before it gets to the customer. Further laboratory measurements were done on the analogue network model to assess the applicability of these methods to real networks. Particularly the distance relay method which showed very good performance in PSCAD/EMTDC simulations. Results indicate that the distance relay method is suitable for application to real networks as it showed correct sag <b>source</b> <b>indications</b> in both simulations and measurements.

The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the utility of combining PSG with 18 -channel EEG in select patients with paroxysmal nocturnal events or other symptoms concerning for sleep disorders, nocturnal seizures or both. MethodsConsecutive combined PSG–EEG studies (n= 237) were performed between 10 / 1 / 2005 and 8 / 1 / 2009. Demographics, referral <b>source,</b> <b>indications,</b> and results were reviewed and analyzed. ResultsOf the 237 consecutive combined PSG–EEG studies performed, 93 % revealed the presence of a primary sleep disorder, 38 % were shown to have abnormal EEGs, and 37 % had both. Among the 221 subjects (93 %) shown to have sleep disorders, the majority of these cases were obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) 89 %, followed by periodic limp movements of sleep (PLMS) 22 % and rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD) 6 %. Significantly more patients with known epilepsy were diagnosed with OSA then were patients without a seizure history. ConclusionsCombined PSG–EEG, utilizing 18 -channel EEG, is an under-utilized technique which can assist in diagnosing paroxysmal nocturnal events, and differentiate between the presence of a primary sleep disorder, seizure activity, or both.

40|$|About {{one third}} of ischaemic {{cerebrovascular}} diseases have embolic properties. Because of that, transcranial Doppler (TCD) test for detection of microembolic signals (MES), as the only one method for detection of microemboli, {{is a very important}} test for the evaluation of cerebral artery embolism. Cerebral emboli are particles of thrombus or atheromatous plaque, platelet aggregates, lipid or air particles in cerebral circulation, which can occlude arterioles and cause ischemic transient attack (TIA) or stroke. Most frequently, they derive from exulcerated plaques of the carotid bifurcation or the aortic arch, from the atrial thrombus, prosthetic heart valves, as well as during carotid endarterectomy, arterial stent, aortocoronary by-pass. For MES detection, bilateral monitoring of a. cerebri mediae (ACM) is performed with each probe held in place over a temporal bone. MES are represented as brightly coloured embolic tracks as they pass through the insonated arteries. A computer hard disk provides continuous recording that is replayed for counting embolic signals. Colour intensity or acoustic range indicate the size and structure of MES. MES in the range of one ACM indicate the source of embolism on the ipsilateral carotid artery, while the bilateral detection of MES suggests a cardiogenic <b>source.</b> <b>Indications</b> for TCD detection of MES are the evaluation of pathogenesis and risk for embolic stroke or TIA and assessing the source of embolism. We started applying this method at the Institute of Neurology in Belgrade 2 years ago. We have investigated 78 patients till today and detected MES in 23 patients (28. 7 %).

40|$|The {{value of}} the multivariate data {{analysis}} tools principal component analysis (PCA) and principal component discriminant analysis (PCDA) for prioritizing leads generated by microarrays was evaluated. To this end, Pseudomonas putida S 12 was grown in independent triplicate fermentations on four different carbon sources, i. e. fructose, glucose, gluconate and succinate. RNA isolated from these samples was analysed in duplicate on an anonymous clone-based array to avoid bias during data analysis. The relevant transcripts were identified by analysing the loadings of the principal components (PC) and discriminants (D) in PCA and PCDA, respectively. Even more specifically, the relevant transcripts for a specific phenotype could also be ranked from the loadings under an angle (biplot) obtained after PCDA analysis. The leads identified in this way were compared with those identified using the commonly applied fold-difference and hierarchical clustering approaches. The different data analysis methods gave different results. The methods used were complementary and together resulted in a comprehensive picture of the processes important for the different carbon sources studied. For the more subtle, regulatory processes in a cell, the PCDA approach {{seemed to be the}} most effective. Except for glucose and gluconate dehydrogenase, all genes involved in the degradation of glucose, gluconate and fructose were identified. Moreover, the transcriptomics approach resulted in potential new insights into the physiology of the degradation of these carbon <b>sources.</b> <b>Indications</b> of iron limitation were observed with cells grown on glucose, gluconate or succinate but not with fructose-grown cells. Moreover, several cytochrome- or quinone-associated genes seemed to be specifically up- or downregulated, indicating that the composition of the electron-transport chain in P. putida S 12 might change significantly in fructose-grown cells compared to glucose-, gluconate- or succinate-grown cells. © 2006 SGM...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The EGRET {{instrument}} has measured detailed photon spectra between 30 MeV and 10 GeV, {{which are}} represented by means of single power-law fits for sources in the 3 EG catalog. However, various <b>sources</b> show <b>indications</b> of spectral cutoffs at GeV energies, which are poorly represented by such simple fits. In the case of well exposed or bright EGRET sources, a description of spectral cutoffs with more complicated functional forms appears to be applicable. An application for such multicomponent fits should be seen in extrapolations beyond the energies accessible to EGRET, i. e. for detectability studies of low-threshold Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). In cases of unidentified gamma-ray sources positionally coincident with Supernova remnants, the spectral shape beyond power-law extrapolations might observationally explain why such prominent SNRs like γ Cygni, IC 443 and CTA 1 have not been detected during several observation campaigns performed by IACTs over the last years. ...|$|R
