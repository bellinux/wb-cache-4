5|$|A {{chattering}} <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> made by rapidly gnashing the teeth, and {{is generally}} {{a sign of}} warning. Guinea pigs tend to raise their heads when making this sound.|$|E
5|$|Whirring: This <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> {{produced}} by cubs bickering over a kill; the pitch rises with {{the intensity of}} the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.|$|E
5|$|A {{vampire bat}} has front teeth that are {{specialized}} for cutting {{and the back}} teeth are much smaller than in other bats. The inferior colliculus, {{the part of the}} bat's brain that processes <b>sound,</b> <b>is</b> well adapted to detecting the regular breathing sounds of sleeping animals that serve as its main food source.|$|E

50|$|The drum <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> sampled {{together}} from various drum machines with an Akai S900. The tom <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> from an Oberheim DMX {{which had been}} used on First and Last and Always. The remaining drum <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> from a Yamaha RX-5.|$|R
5|$|When {{fin whale}} <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> first {{recorded}} by US biologists, {{they did not}} realize that these unusually loud, long, pure and regular <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> being made by whales. They first investigated the possibilities that the <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> due to equipment malfunction, geophysical phenomena, or even part of a Soviet Union scheme for detecting enemy submarines. Eventually, biologists demonstrated that the <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> the vocalizations of fin whales.|$|R
5|$|Although {{they are}} {{sometimes}} included {{in the category of}} electronic organs, the majority of Hammond organs are, strictly speaking, electric or electromechanical rather than electronic organs, because the <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> produced by moving parts rather than electronic oscillators.|$|E
5|$|Churring: The {{purpose of}} this <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to that of}} the chirp. It may {{resemble}} a growl. Zoologist Jonathan Kingdon considered the chirp of the cheetah as similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr, is staccato and has a shorter range than the chirp. A study showed that churrs comprise 3to 15 separate pulses and last 0.1to 1.3 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the {{flared end}} {{is known as}} the bell. Contrary to popular belief, the bell does not amplify the sound; rather, it {{improves}} the uniformity of the instrument's tone for the lowest notes in each register. For the other notes the <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> produced almost entirely at the tone holes and the bell is irrelevant. On basset horns and larger clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe basic {{difference}} between real and virtual <b>sound</b> environments <b>is</b> that virtual <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> originating from another environment or are artificially created, whereas the real <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> the natural existing {{sounds in the}} user's own environment. Augmented Reality Audio combines these aspects in a way where real and virtual <b>sound</b> scenes <b>are</b> mixed so that virtual <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> perceived as an extension or a complement to the natural ones...|$|R

5|$|Gojira's <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> {{not easily}} classifiable as they blend several styles. Gojira are a {{technical}} death metal band that blends death metal, groove metal, and progressive metal. Gojira {{have been influenced}} by heavy metal artists such as Slayer, Sepultura, Death, Morbid Angel, Meshuggah, Tool, Metallica, Pantera, and Neurosis.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers may be {{confused}} with Ensifera (crickets, etc.), but they differ in many aspects; these include the number of segments in their antennae {{and the structure of}} the ovipositor, as well as the location of the tympanal organ and the methods by which <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> produced. Ensiferans have antennae that can be much longer than the body and have at least 20–24 segments, while caeliferans have fewer segments in their shorter, stouter antennae.|$|E
5|$|Lightning Bolt {{are known}} for their guerrilla-style live performances, where they {{typically}} play on the ground rather than a stage, with the crowd gathered around them. The band's <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> typically loud and aggressive, though the group cites composers Philip Glass and Sun Ra as compositional influences.|$|E
50|$|Long Island <b>Sound</b> <b>was</b> {{formed when}} the {{terminal}} moraine that dammed {{the waters of}} glacial Lake Connecticut failed, and sea water mixed with the lake's fresh waters. The first European to record the existence of Long Island <b>Sound</b> <b>was</b> the Dutch navigator Adriaen Block, who entered the sound from the East River in 1614. The <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> known as The Devil's Belt in colonial times and the reefs that run across the <b>sound</b> <b>were</b> known as Devil's Stepping Stones, from which Stepping Stones Lighthouse got its name.|$|R
50|$|The {{music of}} Twotone {{features}} regular techno conventions, {{such as a}} regular kick drum and snare beat, but these <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> augmented by irregular rhythmic placements and supplemental click and cut sounds. Traditional synthesis methods and <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> often employed, often repeating a simple chord pattern. Other featured <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> vocal snippets and occasional industrial samples.|$|R
50|$|In places {{throughout}} the film, telemetry <b>sounds</b> from spacecraft <b>were</b> integrated {{so that they}} themselves became the music. None of these telemetry <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> from Apollo, because by that time telemetry was so rapid and of such frequency that even slowed down was inaudible to the ear. The telemetry <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> taken from Mariner IV which flew by Mars many years before, the last time such <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> audible.|$|R
5|$|Middle ear - In crown-group mammals, <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> carried {{from the}} eardrum by {{a chain of}} three bones, the malleus, the incus and the stapes. Ancestrally, the malleus and the incus are derived from the {{articular}} and the quadrate bones that constituted the jaw joint of early therapsids.|$|E
5|$|Pavlova was {{recorded}} dancing The Dying Swan in a 1925 silent, nearly complete film, to which <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> often post-applied. The short ballet has influenced interpretations of Odette in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, {{particularly in the}} parting of the lovers in the first lakeside scene.|$|E
5|$|Since many tornadoes are audible {{only when}} very near, <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> {{not to be}} thought of as a {{reliable}} warning signal for a tornado. Tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms; any strong, damaging wind, a severe hail volley, or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound.|$|E
30|$|Qualitative scoring of {{all sources}} of <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> done by two {{researchers}} listening continuously {{to each of}} the 24 -h recordings obtained with the Noxturnal 3.2 software (NoxMedical®, Reykjavik, Iceland), and scoring was performed every 30  s. The most clearly identifiable <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> classified into three main categories: monitor alarms, mechanical ventilator alarms and conversations. If none of these three categories <b>was</b> recognized, the <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> classified as “other.” If many different types of <b>sound</b> <b>were</b> monitored during a given period, the most prevalent source was the one selected by the researchers.|$|R
50|$|The swiping <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> {{presented}} with sliding between notes. The bigger the slide, {{the bigger the}} swipe will be. The exact notes and <b>sound</b> effects <b>were</b> also used for a smaller version called Simon Micro Series. The <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> then re-created for Simon Air.|$|R
50|$|The Marlborough <b>Sounds</b> <b>are</b> an {{extensive}} network of sea-drowned valleys {{at the north}} end of the South Island of New Zealand. The Marlborough <b>Sounds</b> <b>were</b> created by a combination of land subsidence and rising sea levels at the north of the South Island of New Zealand. According to Māori mythology, the <b>sounds</b> <b>are</b> the prows of the sunken wakas of Aoraki.|$|R
5|$|The band's <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> based around having four singer-songwriters, {{with each}} member taking lead vocals on various albums' tracks and singles. In 2013 {{they won the}} Choice Music Prize Irish Album of the Year 2012 for Little Sparks.|$|E
5|$|A concern {{from people}} living along the tunnel {{was that they}} would be subject to low-frequency noise. Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum had demanded that residents be subject to a maximum of 27 decibel A-weighting (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed the requirements and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test was done in the tunnel to insure that the requirements would be met, as low-frequency <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Subjective {{impression}} of steady-state and intermittent <b>sounds</b> <b>was</b> examined. The component sound of intermittent sounds has 30 ms rise- and fall-time without steadystate portion and LAmax was 70 dB. The carrier was white noise. The number of component <b>sounds</b> <b>was</b> varied from 5 to 80 in 4800 ms {{total duration of}} the sound. The steady-state sound with the same duration was also used. The sound levels of the steadystate <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> 53, 59 and 65 dBA. The loudness and the subjective {{impression of}} these <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> judged using magnitude estimation and semantic differential, respectively, by fourteen German participants. The {{results showed that the}} loudness of intermittent <b>sounds</b> <b>was</b> judged louder than that of steady-state sound even if LAeq and LAE values were equal. It was also found that the intermittent <b>sounds</b> <b>were</b> judged more annoying and unpleasant than steady-state sounds. These results suggest that affective impression has an effect even on the judgment of loudness. 1...|$|R

5|$|Assonance, {{where the}} use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the {{beginning}} or end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry, but {{goes back to the}} Homeric epic. Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the tonal elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry. Consonance occurs where a consonant <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.|$|E
5|$|Chinese Nü Yr is an {{extended}} play (EP) by producer Seamus Malliagh, known by his stage name Iglooghost, released on the Brainfeeder label on 30 October 2015. Containing elements of footwork, bass, grime and 2-step garage, the EP's <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> {{represented by a}} worm who goes through several nonsensical lands. To make Chinese Nü Yr, Malliagh first designed the cover art and then developed songs with structures and sound to fit the artwork. Upon release, the EP garnered generally favorable reviews from critics, a common praise being its unique style.|$|E
5|$|Following {{an impromptu}} {{performance}} together in Los Angeles, Hughes and Bonamassa started the side project in November 2009, recruiting Bonham and Sherinian {{on the advice}} of Shirley to finalise the lineup of the band. The name Black Country Communion is derived from the term Black Country, which refers to the West Midlands area of England where Hughes and Bonham grew up. The group's <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> intentionally reminiscent of popular classic rock groups of the 1970s, reflecting the previous work of frontman Hughes (in bands such as Trapeze and Deep Purple) as well as the link between Bonham and his father John's band Led Zeppelin.|$|E
60|$|No <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> to {{be heard}} on the sand-flats after that until about midnight, when the moon {{appeared}} on the horizon. Just then a <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> heard on the river.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> {{also turned}} off when another {{defendant}} discussed {{early days of}} his imprisonment. Judge Ralph Kohlmann said that in both cases <b>sound</b> <b>was</b> turned off because classified information was discussed.|$|R
