5|$|The {{office of}} Register {{has been held}} by the Dean of Windsor since 1558. The Garter Principal King of Arms is ex officio the senior officer of the College of Arms (the heraldic {{authority}} of England), and is usually appointed from among the other officers of arms at the College. As the title suggests, Garter Principal King of Arms has specific duties as the Order's officer of arms, attending to the companions' crests and banners of arms, which are exhibited in the chapel. The Secretary, who acts as deputy to Garter in the ceremonial aspects of the Order, has since 1952 also been selected from the other officers of the College of Arms. The office of Usher is held by the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, {{who is also the}} <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> of the United Kingdom House of Lords (although his functions are more often performed there by his deputy, the Yeoman Usher).|$|E
25|$|The <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> is {{the officer}} who has the duty of {{maintaining}} order in the precincts of the House. The <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> sits in the debating chamber opposite the Speaker at the visitors door for each House sitting session. The <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> is also the custodian of the mace, and bears the mace {{into and out of}} the chamber of the House at the beginning and end of each sitting day.|$|E
25|$|William Christie (1863–1922): Former <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly was a {{resident}} of Ashfield {{at the time of}} his death.|$|E
500|$|The Speaker {{ordered that}} Bellingham be {{transferred}} to the <b>Serjeant-at-Arms's</b> quarters, where MPs [...] who were also magistrates would conduct a committal hearing [...] under the chairmanship of Harvey Christian Combe. The makeshift court heard evidence from eyewitnesses to the crime, and sent messengers to search Bellingham's lodgings. The prisoner kept his composure throughout; although warned against self-incrimination, he insisted on explaining himself: [...] "I have been ill-treated... I have sought redress in vain. I am [...] a most unfortunate man and feel here"—placing hand on heart—"sufficient justification for what I have done." [...] He had, he said, exhausted all proper avenues, and had made it clear to the [...] authorities that he proposed to take independent action. He had been told to do his worst: [...] "I have obeyed them. [...] I have done my worst, and I rejoice in the deed." [...] At around eight o'clock, Bellingham was formally charged with Perceval's murder, and was committed to Newgate Prison to await trial.|$|R
25|$|Keppel became <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> of the British House of Commons in 1915, resigning {{after twenty}} years. In 1929, he was {{appointed}} a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> is {{also the}} {{custodian}} of the Mace of Parliament, and bears the Mace {{into and out of}} the chamber of the House – the room where Parliamentary debates take place – during sittings (see below).|$|E
25|$|A {{specific}} kind {{of military}} sergeant was the <b>serjeant-at-arms,</b> one of a body of armed men retained by English lords and monarchs. The title is now given to an officer in modern legislative bodies who is charged with keeping order during meetings and, if necessary, forcibly removing disruptive members.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> is {{the officer}} of Parliament {{who has the}} duty of {{maintaining}} order in the precincts of the House. For instance, if the conduct of any MP is grossly disorderly during a sitting of Parliament, the Speaker or a committee chairman may order {{him or her to}} withdraw immediately from Parliament {{for the rest of the}} day's sitting, and the Speaker or chairman may instruct the Serjeant to enforce the order. The Speaker may also direct an MP to withdraw when Parliament has voted to suspend him or her for committing the offence of disregarding the authority of the Chair or of persistently and wilfully obstructing the business of Parliament. If the MP refuses to obey this direction despite having been summoned several times to do so by the Serjeant acting under the Speaker's orders, the Serjeant may use force to compel the MP's obedience to the direction.|$|E
500|$|The Usher of the Order was [...] "the Usher at Arms {{named the}} Black Rod". The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod in Ireland was {{distinct}} from the English officer of the same name, though like his counterpart he had some duties in the Irish House of Lords. (The latter continues to serve as Usher to the Order of the Garter and as <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> of the House of Lords.) The Irish post has been vacant since 1933.|$|E
500|$|The {{role of the}} pairing whip {{remained}} a crucial one as the government's slim majority turned to a minority through defeats at by-elections, and Dormand was credited with {{a central role in}} helping the government stay in office, [...] telling Wilson that he was too [...] "bloody knackered {{at the end of the}} day" [...] to record the events surrounding the late-night votes. In January 1978 Dormand was named in a report by the <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> as having assisted in blocking one of the Division lobbies in an attempt to prevent a vote on part of the Government's legislation to devolve power to Scotland.|$|E
500|$|This {{view was}} doubted by Sir John Hobhouse, the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests, {{who oversaw the}} upkeep of royal buildings, {{including}} the Palace of Westminster. He wrote that [...] "the crowd behaved very well; only one man was taken up for huzzaing when the flames increased.... on the whole, {{it was impossible for}} any large assemblage of people to behave better." [...] Many of the MPs and peers present, including Lord Palmerston, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, helped break down doors to rescue books and other treasures, aided by passers-by; the Deputy <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> had to break into a burning room to save the parliamentary mace.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1901 and 1910 {{he served}} as a <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> in the House of Lords to King Edward VII. [...] He was {{appointed}} Paymaster of the Household in 1910 to King George V, which duty he performed until his death later that year.|$|E
2500|$|Hughes-Young {{was the son}} of Brigadier-General Henry Young, a Northern Ireland-born [...] Cavalry Officer {{who later}} served as <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> for the Parliament of Northern Ireland. He was sent to Selwyn House Preparatory School in Broadstairs, and then to Harrow School; he {{followed}} his father into the Army, studying at Sandhurst. In 1932 he joined the Black Watch.|$|E
2500|$|Seymour became {{commanding}} officer of the fifth-rate HMS Fortunée in June 1812 and of the fifth-rate HMS Leonidas in January 1813 during the War of 1812. In HMS Leonidas he captured the privateer USS Paul Jones in May 1813. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 4 June 1815. He became <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> to the House of Lords in 1818 and was given a short leave of absence to undertake a tour as {{commanding officer}} of the fifth-rate HMS Briton on [...] "particular service" [...] in 1827. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1831, awarded a British knighthood on 23 March 1831 and advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order on 9 December 1834. In June 1837 he attended the funeral of King William IV, Seymour's last act as Master of the Robes to the King.|$|E
2500|$|Little {{is known}} about the early history of Locust Grove. [...] It was evidently {{constructed}} sometime before 1794, as Francisco took up residence in the house in that year, living there until the mid-1820s (one source states that he took possession in 1785, while another [...] suggests, on the basis of style, a date between 1790 and 1810). [...] Francisco himself had local ties, having grown up at Hunting Towers, the nearby estate of Patrick Henry's uncle Judge Anthony Winston. [...] It is unknown how he came to own the land upon which Locust Grove sits; family tradition holds that he received it from local planter James Anderson, who had been the father of his first wife, Susannah. [...] In any event, he lived there with his second wife, Catherine Brooke, with whom he raised four children. [...] She died in 1821; two years later he married again, this time to a widowed niece of Governor Edmund Randolph. [...] She persuaded him to leave the countryside for a more comfortable life in Richmond, where he worked as the <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> of the Senate of Virginia, and in which city he remained until his death.|$|E
2500|$|Unless {{otherwise}} {{notified by}} the Speaker, a Parliamentary sitting begins at 1:30pm. It {{begins with the}} Speaker's procession, during which the <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> enters the chamber of the House bearing the Mace of Parliament on his right shoulder ahead of the Speaker, the Clerk of Parliament, and the Clerk's assistants. Members of Parliament rise in their places upon the entry of the Speaker and bow to him, and he reciprocates. The mace is an ornamented staff that represents the Speaker's authority and is the Serjeant's emblem of office. When Parliament's predecessor, the Legislative Assembly, acquired the Mace in 1958, the Speaker, Sir George Oehlers, invited members to [...] "accept that the Mace {{is an essential part}} of the equipment of this Assembly and that this Assembly cannot, in future, be considered to be properly constituted unless the Mace be first brought into the House and laid on the Table". The Mace is placed on the Table of the House, which is a table in the centre of the debating chamber between the front benches. There are two sets of brackets on the Table, and when the Speaker is in his chair the Mace is placed on the upper brackets. The Mace is removed to the lower brackets when the House sits as a committee, and is not brought into the chamber when the President addresses Parliament.|$|E
2500|$|To bring {{a debate}} to a close, an MP may move [...] "that the {{question}} be now put". The debate ends if the motion is carried (that is, {{a majority of}} MPs vote to support the motion). The Speaker then puts the question on the original motion to the House and calls for a vote. To determine whether this motion is carried, the Speaker will [...] "collect the voices" [...] by saying, [...] "As many as are of that opinion say 'Aye'", and MPs supporting the motion will respond [...] "Aye". The Speaker then says [...] "To the contrary say 'No'", and MPs opposing the motion will say [...] "No". Following this, the Speaker assesses the number of votes and says, [...] "I think the Ayes (or Noes) have it". At this point, an MP may challenge the Speaker's decision by claiming a division. If at least five other MPs rise in their places to support the challenge, the Speaker will direct that the division bells be rung {{for at least a}} minute. After that, the Speaker orders the <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> to lock the doors of the chamber. The Speaker then puts the question a second time. If a division is again claimed, the Speaker asks each MP to vote [...] "Aye" [...] or [...] "No", or to indicate {{that he or she is}} abstaining from voting. MPs must vote in the same way as they did when voices were taken collectively. Votes and abstentions are recorded using an electronic system. If it appears that a quorum is not present, the division is invalid and the matter is postponed till the next sitting. Otherwise, the Speaker states the numbers of MPs voting [...] "Aye" [...] and [...] "No" [...] and declares the results of the division. The Serjeant then unlocks the doors.|$|E
60|$|The <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> {{once more}} stood {{up before the}} people and loudly read a proclamation, calling upon the Lieutenant of the Tower of London to return his precept and bring forth his prisoner.|$|E
60|$|The distant murmurs grew in volume, {{then came}} nearer and nearer. All necks were craned {{to see the}} Duke arrive, and even the {{repeated}} calls of the <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> demanding silence were now left unheeded.|$|E
6000|$|A surging, seething crowd! heads upon {{heads in}} a dense, compact mass--a double row of men, women, boys, and girls, held back with {{difficulty}} by the <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> and his men, armed with halberds and tipstaves! ...|$|E
6000|$|Then my Lord High Steward {{stood up}} bareheaded, holding the white rod in his hand, and the <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> stepped {{forward into the}} {{immediate}} centre of the Hall facing the crowd, and read out the proclamation as follows:-- ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>Serjeant-at-Arms</b> {{had much}} ado {{to make himself}} heard. The guard had {{literally}} to make an onslaught on the crowd. It was fully five or ten minutes before the noise subsided; then only did murmurs die down like {{the roar of the}} sea when the surf recedes from the shore.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the same}} Parliament, {{there was another}} and {{scarcely}} less remarkable case of Privilege, [...] "that eldest son of Prerogative," [...] as Burke truly called it, [...] "and inheriting all the vices of its parent." [...] Certain printers were accused of breach of privilege for reporting the debates of the House (March, 1771). The messenger of the <b>serjeant-at-arms</b> attempted {{to take one of}} them into custody in his own shop in the city. A constable was standing by, designedly, it has been supposed, and Miller, the printer, gave the messenger into his custody for an assault. The case came on before the Lord Mayor, Alderman Wilkes, and Alderman Oliver, the same evening, and the result was that the messenger of the House was committed. The city doctrine was, that if the House of Commons had a <b>serjeant-at-arms,</b> they had a serjeant-at-mace. If the House of Commons could send their citizens to Newgate, they could send its messenger to the Compter. Two other printers were collusively arrested, brought before Wilkes and Oliver, and at once liberated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] adds Mr. Norton, [...] "there was a cheer {{raised from}} the people inside the Hall which was quite {{deafening}} to the ears. Sundry tossed their caps into the air, {{and many of the}} women began to cry. My Lord High Steward could not make himself heard for a long while, at which he became very wrathful, and, calling to the <b>Serjeant-at-Arms,</b> he bade him clear the Court of all these noise-makers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 6. Smiting {{upon the}} breast seems to intimate, {{that the party}} so doing is very {{apprehensive}} of some great loss that he has sustained, either by negligence, carelessness, foolishness, or the like. And {{this is the way}} in which men do lose their souls. Now, to lose a thing, a great thing, the only choice thing that a man has, negligently, carelessly, foolishly, or the like, why, it puts aggravations into the thoughts of the loss that the man has sustained, and aggravations into the thoughts of them go out of the soul, and come in upon a sudden, even as the bailiff or the king's <b>serjeant-at-arms,</b> and at every appearance of them, makes the soul start; and starting, it smites upon the breast.|$|E
60|$|Retracing our steps {{through the}} long passage, {{descending}} the stairs, and crossing Palace-yard, we halt at a small temporary doorway adjoining the King’s entrance to the House of Lords. The order of the <b>serjeant-at-arms</b> will admit you into the Reporters’ gallery, from whence you can obtain a tolerably {{good view of the}} House. Take care of the stairs, they are none of the best; through this little wicket—there. As soon as your eyes become a little used to the mist of the place, and the glare of the chandeliers below you, you will see that some unimportant personage on the Ministerial side of the House (to your right hand) is speaking, amidst a hum of voices and confusion which would rival Babel, but for the circumstance of its being all in one language.|$|E
60|$|We hope {{our readers}} {{will not be}} alarmed at this rather ominous title. We assure them {{that we are not}} about to become political, neither have we the {{slightest}} intention of being more prosy than usual—if we can help it. It has occurred to us that a slight sketch of the general aspect of ‘the House,’ and the crowds that resort to it on the night of an important debate, would be productive of some amusement: and as we have made some few calls at the aforesaid house in our time—have visited it quite often enough for our purpose, and a great deal too often for our personal peace and comfort—we have determined to attempt the description. Dismissing from our minds, therefore, all that feeling of awe, which vague ideas of breaches of privilege, <b>Serjeant-at-Arms,</b> heavy denunciations, and still heavier fees, are calculated to awaken, we enter at once into the building, and upon our subject.|$|E
60|$|The Speaker, {{it may be}} said, {{thought this}} view of (M7) Mr. Gladstone’s a mistake, and that when Bradlaugh refused to withdraw, {{the leader of the}} House ought, as a matter of policy, to have been the person to move first the order to withdraw, next the committal to the custody of the <b>serjeant-at-arms.</b> “I was placed in a false position,” says the Speaker, “and so was the House, in having to follow the lead of the leader of the opposition, while the leader of the House and the great {{majority}} were passive spectators.”(6) As Mr. Gladstone {{and other members of the}} government voted for Bradlaugh’s committal, on the ground that his resistance to the serjeant had nothing to do with the establishment of his rights before either a court or his constituency, it would seem that the Speaker’s complaint is not unjust. To this position, however, Mr. Gladstone adhered, in entire conformity apparently to the wishes of the keenest members of his cabinet and the leading men of his party.|$|E
6000|$|This day, {{when the}} Speaker took the chair {{at a quarter}} past [...] twelve, Mr. Bradlaugh came {{to the table and}} claimed to take the [...] oath. The Speaker read to him the {{resolution}} of the House which [...] forbids it. Mr. Bradlaugh asked to be heard, and no objection was [...] taken. He then addressed the House from the bar. His address was [...] that of a consummate speaker. But it was an address which could [...] not have any effect unless the House had undergone a complete [...] revolution of mind. He challenged the legality of the act of the [...] House, expressing hereby an opinion in which Mr. Gladstone [...] himself, going beyond some other members of the minority, has the [...] misfortune to lean towards agreeing with him.... The Speaker now [...] again announced to Mr. Bradlaugh the resolution of the House. Only [...] a small minority voted against enforcing it. Mr. Bradlaugh [...] declining to withdraw, was removed by the <b>serjeant-at-arms.</b> Having [...] suffered this removal, he again came beyond the bar, and entered [...] into what was almost a corporal struggle with the serjeant. [...] Hereupon Sir S. Northcote moved that Mr. Bradlaugh be committed [...] for his offence. Mr. Gladstone said that while he thought it did [...] not belong to him, under the circumstances of the case, to advise [...] the House, he could take no objection to the advice thus given.|$|E
60|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1792 Burke's son went to Dublin as the agent and adviser of the Catholic Committee, who at first listened to him with the respect due to one in whom they expected to meet the qualities of his father. They soon {{found out that he}} was utterly without either tact or judgment; that he was arrogant, impertinent, vain, and empty. Wolfe Tone declared him to be by far the most impudent and opinionative fellow that he had ever known in his life. Nothing could exceed the absurdity of his conduct, and on one occasion he had a very narrow escape of being taken into custody by the <b>Serjeant-at-arms,</b> for rushing down from the gallery into the Irish House of Commons, and attempting to make a speech in defence of a petition which he had drawn up, and which was being attacked by a member in his place. Richard Burke went home, it is said, with two thousand guineas in his pocket, which the Catholics had cheerfully paid as the price of getting rid of him. He returned shortly after, but only helped to plunge the business into further confusion, and finally left the scene covered with odium and discredit. His father's Letter to Sir Hercules Langrishe (1792) remains an admirable monument of wise statesmanship, a singular interlude of calm and solid reasoning {{in the midst of a}} fiery whirlwind of intense passion. Burke perhaps felt that the state of Ireland was passing away from the sphere of calm and solid reason, when he knew that Dumouriez's victory over the allies at Valmy, which filled Beaconsfield with such gloom and dismay, was celebrated at Dublin by an illumination.|$|E
60|$|A popular origin cannot {{therefore}} be the characteristical distinction {{of a popular}} representative. This belongs equally to all parts of government and in all forms. The virtue, spirit, and essence of a House of Commons consists in its being the express image of {{the feelings of the}} nation. It was not instituted to be a control upon the people, as of late it has been taught, by a doctrine of the most pernicious tendency. It was designed as a control for the people. Other institutions have been formed for the purpose of checking popular excesses; and they are, I apprehend, fully adequate to their object. If not, they ought to be made so. The House of Commons, as it was never intended for the support of peace and subordination, is miserably appointed for that service; having no stronger weapon than its mace, and no better officer than its <b>serjeant-at-arms,</b> which it can command of its own proper authority. A vigilant and jealous eye over executory and judicial magistracy; an anxious care of public money; an openness, approaching towards facility, to public complaint: these seem to be the true characteristics of a House of Commons. But an addressing House of Commons, and a petitioning nation; a House of Commons full of confidence, when the nation is plunged in despair; in the utmost harmony with ministers, whom the people regard with the utmost abhorrence; who vote thanks, when the public opinion calls upon them for impeachments; who are eager to grant, when the general voice demands account; who, in all disputes between the people and administration, presume against the people; who punish their disorders, but refuse even to inquire into the provocations to them; this is an unnatural, a monstrous state of things in this constitution. Such an assembly may be a great, wise, awful senate; but it is not, to any popular purpose, a House of Commons. This change from an immediate state of procuration and delegation to a course of acting as from original power, {{is the way in which}} all the popular magistracies in the world have been perverted from their purposes. It is indeed their greatest and sometimes their incurable corruption. For there is a material distinction between that corruption by which particular points are carried against reason, (this is a thing which cannot be prevented by human wisdom, and is of loss consequence,) and the corruption of the principle itself For then the evil is not accidental, but settled. The distemper becomes the natural habit.|$|E
