2500|$|Consulting {{producer}} for A Nero Wolfe Mystery, Doyle was the show's only full-time writer — overseeing {{the work of}} freelance screenwriters and writing 11 of the teleplays herself. She devoted most of {{her attention to the}} dialogue: [...] "What Stout writes actually sounds good when you <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud,</b> but the stuff that makes you laugh out loud and fall {{on the floor in the}} books doesn't work most of the time when you transpose it directly into actors' mouths. Frequently I end up moving words — tenderly and respectfully — but retaining as much of the language as possible. I feel a great belief in Rex Stout. I see the script process as writing his second draft." ...|$|E

She {{spent two years in}} the jungles of Peru as part of her doctoral research and used the experience as background for her first novel, Go and Come Back (1998). Go and Come Back, about a young Peruvian girl's encounter with anthropologists, earned numerous awards and citations, including a [...] "Best Books for Young Adults" [...] selection of the American Library Association and [...] "Book Prize Finalist" [...] selection of the Los Angeles Times.

25|$|Most ACT {{self-help}} books (e.g.,) and many tested ACT protocols teach formal contemplative practice skills, but by this definition of mindfulness, such defusion skills as word repetition (taking a difficult thought, distilling it {{to a single}} word, and <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> repeatedly <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> for 30 seconds) are also viewed as mindfulness methods.|$|R
40|$|Groups of {{participants}} identified {{the color of}} color-word stimuli either by typing the first letter of the color name or by <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud.</b> Half the groups saw congruent and incongruent stimuli; the others saw neutral and incongruent stimuli. Incongruent probability varied between groups from 0. 25 to 0. 86 in six steps. Incongruent inhibition was significant in all conditions but was greater with typing and with congruent stimuli. Inhibition decreased linearly with increasing incongruent probability. Color identification process remained stable as incongruent proportion increased, but word identification process was reduced, partially supporting process dissociation. Neutral RT with typing was usually faster when preceded by a neutral stimulus than an incongruent stimulus about half the time. The preceding stimulus {{had little effect on}} incongruent RT. Relevant dimensional changes slowed RT more than irrelevant ones. Results suggest stimulus-response compatibility, color-word process dissociation, and priming are the important mechanisms for modeling color-word responses. Variation of an irrelevant dimension can inhibit responding to a relevant dimension (c. f. Garner & Felfoldy, 1970). In the current study, stimulus color was the relevant dimension an...|$|R

Jack accepts that that may happen, and refuses to give the case away. Later on, they have a meeting with another industrialist, Solomon Grundy, whose wife is Rapunzel. When she takes off her hat and her hair falls to the ground, Spratt and Mary {{remember}} the 28 ft hair found in Humpty's bedroom. Solomon shows them into a room with an abnormal amount of security. The security was so big that if a person went in, they had to wear no shoes in case of being detected. In the centre has a puzzle piece, the sacred gonga, held in unbreakable glass. It has magic powers which he reveals to Jack and Mary by putting them {{on each side of}} the room. When Jack thinks of a number, Mary <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud.</b> This was so amazing that Solomon decided to put it on display for everyone in Reading.|$|R

Wesley figures {{out a way to}} said world and as Jasmine's army attempt to capture the team, Wesley opens a portal and sends Angel through telling him to find Jasmine's real name which will break her spell. The team are captured and taken back to the hotel during which Jasmine begins to make her presence known to the world at large. Connor meanwhile becomes dissatisfied with Jasmine's actions and seeks out Cordelia whom he finds resting in a protected church.

He {{interrupts}} her midway through the altercation, but she views him as a bum. She determines to take his sword but Kenshin easily avoids her attacks. She and Kenshin then begin traveling to Kyoto together. They stop near Shingetsu Village, where they meet a young boy. He tells them that his village is under control of Shishio Makoto. Misao and Kenshin, later accompanied by Saitō Hajime, free the village. As the story progresses Misao, who has become rather attached to Kenshin, becomes angry at him for not depending on anyone else. After Kenshin leaves, she met Kamiya Kaoru and Myōjin Yahiko when she recognizes a picture of Kenshin posted on the wall of a restaurant called Shirobeko (in the anime Misao runs into Yahiko while she is chasing after Kenshin). Misao takes Kaoru and Yahiko to Kenshin at his Hiko Seijūrō's home. On the way back, Yahiko remembers that he forgot to warn Kenshin about Aoshi, who he had seen in Kyoto a few days before, and <b>says</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud.</b> Misao had heard of this and demands to know about Aoshi; Kaoru complies, grateful for the chance to see Kenshin again.|$|R
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stay" [...] was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller. On February 10, 2013, whilst walking the red carpet of the 55th Grammy Awards, Rihanna held an interview with Ryan Seacrest who officially revealed that the music video would premiere on E! News the following day. Rihanna described the production saying, [...] "The video was really, really simple. I pretty much stayed put in a bathtub, and we shot it really tight, really close. There's Mikky Ekko in the video as well. This {{is the first time}} I've ever collaborated with him, so I'm excited about that because he's actually the one who wrote the song and I kinda just {{fell in love with it}} so much and in love with the tone of his voice and we wanna keep him a part of it, so you'll see him in the video." [...] The singer added, [...] "It's a very emotional song and it's personal, so you just think about, it's almost like telling a story, and when you tell a story, even to yourself — if you're <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> and expressing how you feel — it needs to be powerful because it needs to be authentic." [...] On February 11, Rihanna leaked an [...] "uncut" [...] version of the video on Twitter prior to the official premiere, featuring the singer performing to the track in one singular take, without Mikky Ekko. The official version premiered on E! News later that day. It was then uploaded to Rihanna's official VEVO account at 8AM ET the following day. Shortly after the video was uploaded, it was flagged by YouTube for its sexual content. The flag has since been removed.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Name" [...] {{referred}} to in [...] "Master of the Name" [...] is the most holy Four-Letter Name of God or Tetragrammaton. In Jewish tradition, this Name was pronounced only by the High Priest on Yom Kippur. With {{the destruction of the}} Second Temple by the Romans in the year 70 CE, the true pronunciation was presumably lost. (Jews today do not pronounce the Name <b>out</b> <b>loud,</b> and substitute another Hebrew word, usually Adonai, in prayers and texts.) In some accounts, a Baal Shem was believed to have re-discovered the true pronunciation, perhaps during deep meditation, and could use it in magical ways to work miracles. Some stories <b>say</b> he pronounced <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud,</b> others <b>say</b> he visualized the Name in his mind. He also used the names of angels in this way.|$|R

5000|$|Writer and {{director}} David Robert Mitchell conceived the film based on recurring dreams {{he had in}} his youth about being followed: [...] "I didn't use those images for the film, but the basic idea and the feeling I used. From what I understand, it's an anxiety dream. Whatever I was going through at that time, my parents divorced when I was around that age, so I imagine it was something to do with that." [...] The role that sexual transmission plays came later, from Mitchell's desire for something that could transfer between people. Mitchell started writing the film in 2011 while working on a separate film he intended to be his second feature film; however, Mitchell struggled with this would-be second feature and made It Follows as his next film instead. Mitchell realized that the concept he was working on was tough to describe and thus refused to discuss the plot when asked what he was working on, reasoning later, [...] "When you <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud,</b> it sounds like the worst thing ever." ...|$|E

While trying to find Goggles and Blotch, Pilgrim and Croaker get captured by Wilson. Kermit overhears Wilson heading to biology class, so he hitches a ride on a student's backpack. Krassman decides to dissect Goggles, but Blotch takes his place to return the favor for rescuing them from Vicki. Krassman discides to dissect Croaker instead, when Wilson brings him into the class. Mary refuses to show the class how the dissection is done, so she leaves the classroom. In a daring rescue, Kermit manages to free Croaker from the dissection table and fend off Dr. Krassman using some swashbuckling techniques he picked up earlier at a movie theater from the movie The Black Arrow, but Krassman is able to defeat Kermit, Croaker, and Blotch. Goggles finds the knife that Kermit dropped, but after he picks it up, Krassman spots him. Despite the warnings that Kermit should never talk to humans, Kermit stops Krassman from killing Goggles by talking and asks him to please release the frogs. This decision by Kermit reveals that Krassman, as a child, when he was going to dissect his first frog, the frog spoke to him, but he refused to <b>say</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>loud</b> to everyone else in Krassman's classroom, which caused him to be humiliated. Krassman frees all the frogs and dismisses the class and enables Kermit and his friends to return home.
