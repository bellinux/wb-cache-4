This study explores the factors of social processes behind Sweden´s largest biosphere reserve, a model area for sustainable development, Nedre Dalälven River Landscape. The aim is to study underlying incentives {{in the establishment of}} a biosphere reserve to detect critical social factors in the initial work for sustainable development. Critical discourse analysis will serve as a theoretical point of departure but also as an analytical method since it connects external circumstances with individual perspectives. The data was collected through individual interviews, a group interview, participatory observations and document readings. <b>Social</b> <b>negotiations</b> in this study refer to individual needs, people´s relations as well as needs that concern organizational business relations. Information is collected as a combination of written sources, such as official documents and local papers articles, semi-structured interviews of individuals and a group interview. The result showed that the driving force behind becoming a biosphere, the local association NeDa, was important for the fellowship. NeDa was understood as public good and as working for the best of the community. The biosphere reserve was perceived as a confirmation of the capabilities of local people. The meaning of sustainable development was filled with local matters which enabled a biosphere reserve well established in the area.

Environmental action is still not seen as a 'cool' social practice in some adolescent peer groups.

Our case demonstrates the value of a ‘heterogeneous’ approach to website usability that involves engineering this context by negotiating the social alongside the technical.

40|$|In {{response}} to energy policies and technological innovation, electricity systems {{are becoming more}} integrated and interdependent. In the Western United States, {{the creation of an}} energy imbalance market (EIM) is a significant move towards electricity grid integration. The question of how to govern this newly forming market has been deliberated in multiple decision-making venues. Through these deliberations, stakeholders engaged in the process of policy implementation and shaped the structure of the EIM as a policy intervention. To understand how this initiative unfolded and why this effort succeeded where others failed, this research explores policy implementation as the outcome of the <b>social</b> <b>negotiation</b> of authority. To accomplish this, this research combines policy implementation, boundary work, and field theories and develops an empirical investigation of how actors reconciled multiple and often conflicting authorities to enact policy change. This study asks how actors, using social practices and strategies, created and legitimated sources of authority to establish a governing body for this new market service. This case study relied on qualitative methods, including document review, participant interviews, systematic observation of decision-making in context, detailed observation fieldnotes, and the self-reflexive awareness {{of the role of the}} researcher. The dissertation demonstrates that: 1) dominant yet deficient narratives provided a rationale for ongoing resistance to regional governance in the West and prevented collaboration; 2) actors overcame and transformed deficient sources of authority by enacting social strategies that allowed alternative interpretations of the EIM construct and enabled organizations to begin collaboration; 3) actors using <b>social</b> <b>negotiation</b> interpreted and adjusted the EIM policy intervention and co-created emergent forms of authority that are flexible and dynamic; and 4) field interdependencies surfaced taken-for-granted assumptions and provided critical resources for innovative forms of collective action. The implications of these findings highlight the importance of the <b>social</b> <b>negotiation</b> of authority in energy policy implementation. Specifically, the research makes several theoretical and practical contributions: 1) multi-organizational policy implementation is a social process of transforming, negotiating, and co-creating authority, and relational authority can be an important rationale for enacted practices; 2) strategic actors engage in communicative and social processes in which authority is emergent and abstraction enables collective action without requiring consensus; 3) routine field interdependencies can bring attention to taken-for-granted assumptions and create a moment of co-authoring; and 4) regional electricity system governance structures evolve as they balance the inherent tensions of organized market participation...|$|R
