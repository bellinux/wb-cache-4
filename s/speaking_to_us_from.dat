In this course we will observe and study a wide range of culture artifacts through the lens of a persistent question mark (?) in the context of American culture.

5000|$|The {{album was}} titled {{as a joke}} about {{attempts}} to rationalize a state of spirituality. The opening song [...] "Bodhisattva" [...] is about how buying and selling can lead to redemption. Its title refers to the Bodhisattva, those who have achieved spiritual perfection but who remain in the material world to help others. The song's protagonist asks them to take him {{by the hand and}} show him the [...] "shine of your Japan / the sparkle of your China." [...] Attracted by the lure of Eastern religion and material goods, he then pledges to sell his [...] "house in town" [...] in order to move and affiliate himself with the Eastern world. Fagen summarized the song's message as [...] "Lure of East. Hubris of hippies. Quick fix". [...] "Razor Boy" [...] is a bitter, ironic pop song with lyrics that subtly criticize complacency and materialism. According to Ivan Kreilkamp of Spin, [...] "Steely Dan <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> that 'cold and windy day' when the trappings of hipness and sexiness fall away to reveal a lonely figure waiting for a fix. 'Will you still have a song to sing when the razor boy comes and takes your fancy things away?' Fagen asks a generation stupefied by nostalgia and self-involvement".|$|R
40|$|En el seminario interno de la Facultad nos hemos interrogado acerca de la vida, ese misterio fascinante y {{vulnerable}} a la vez. En ese marco, hemos querido escuchar la voz de los escritores, en dos novelas. Pedro Páramo (1955) del escritor mexicano Juan Rulfo (1917 - 1986) y La Amortajada (1938) de la escritora chilena María Luisa Bombal (1910 - 1980). En ambos casos sus protagonistas nos hablan desde el otro lado del sentido de la vida, desde la muerte, pero para radicalizar la pregunta acerca del sentido de la vida, de los encuentros que las han marcado, del cuerpo como mediación de esos encuentros. Un diálogo desde estas figuras del más allá de la vida en las que resuenan con una honda actualidad las grandes temáticas escatológicas de la teología paulina, acerca de la vida eterna como un estar para siempre con el Señor, y acerca del cuerpo con el que resucitaremos Life, that mystery at once {{fascinating and}} vulnerable, was examined {{at a recent}} faculty seminar. Within this framework, {{the author of this}} article endeavors to listen to the voice of the writers of two novels: Pedro Páramo (1955) by the Mexican writer Juan Rulfo (1917 - 1986), and La amortajada ["The Shrouded Woman"] (1938) by the Chilean writer María Luisa Bombal (1910 - 1980). In both cases the literary characters <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> {{the other side of the}} grave, in order to radicalize questions about life, about the meetings that have marked the characters, about the body as mediation of those meetings. Thus, a dialogue emerges from these figures beyond life, in which the great eschatological themes of Pauline theology resonate forcefully and, at the same time, permit a deep reflection upon eternal life as always being with the Lord, as well as regarding the kind of body with which we will rise agai...|$|R
40|$|Can {{one really}} read a painting? Do {{abstract}} works communicate in a universal language of meaning with the marks accumulated on the canvas, the heaviness {{of one kind}} of paint to the other, the impasto of the paint, {{the size of the}} canvas do these all together imprint on <b>us</b> universal feelings, <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> the wall in a language that everyone can understand? It is without doubt a temping, sobering and provoking thought. As Jeremy Gilbert- Rolfe states “…the art world continuous to be a place in which the visual is usually an extension of the verbal: one does not look at most contemporary art so much as one reads it…I have suggested elsewhere that the art world’s distaste for the visual as opposed to the verbal is the function of its fear of beauty and preference for the version of the sublime that may be assimilated to he condition of the discursive” So we have a situation here already expounded by Gilbert-Rolfe that we have a fear of the visual abstract art, could it just not be visually communicative, universal and catholic language, but abstract art needs to be written and read about to explain it to viewer. Could abstract art be an art that can possibly be construed as to be open and to communicate in a visual language in a universal way? My contribution and main research question in this paper would be the argument that there are in general terms the belief with abstract art on the one hand is an art that pertains <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> a universal language to be understood by everyone and all in sundry. However, on the other hand if abstract art is so universal and can be understood and can be interpreted by all, why is there so much written on the subject explaining it? Thus {{at the end of the}} day is abstract art truly a communicative, universal and accessible visual language to be understood by us mere mortals? As Stephen Bann asks too “ On what terms, if at all, we are impelled to ask, does the abstract work communicate? Is the abstract artist perhaps the victim of a solipsistic illusion if he continues to believe that his work holds meaning for the rest of the world” ‘Victim’ or not whether it be the artist or the abstract work itself this poses an interesting situation. We have all at certain times experienced this dilemma when visiting a museum or exhibition, one finds one’s self reading the texts on the wall by the painting or sitting in front of the painting reading explanatory notes and essays in the catalogues to understand what is going on with an abstract manifestation on a wall before us...|$|R

We pass through the gate of the legend fatal to hope, and with pity or with joy behold the horror of another world. The hypocrites go by, with their painted faces and their cowls of gilded lead. Out of the ceaseless winds that drive them, the carnal look at us, and we watch the heretic rending his flesh, and the glutton lashed by the rain.
