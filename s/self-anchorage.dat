40|$|This study {{presents}} an innovative and original biomaterial designed {{to substitute for}} articular cartilage and mimic its mechanical behavior, including elastic cushioning and the characteristics of fiber-reinforced gel. The material was composed of polyurethane and bioglass microfiber 45 S 5. It was designed to present a tribological surface to the cartilage of the tibial plateau, and to convert over a functional gradient to an osteointegrable region for <b>self-anchorage</b> to the subchondral bone. The biomaterial samples showed no toxicity and promoted cell spreading. Subsequent in vivo studies in rabbits demonstrated {{the formation of a}} rigid structure similar to bone trabeculae in the distal region of the tribological surface of the implant. The tribological surface of the proximal region showed a fibrocartilaginous tissue with highly vascularized chondrocytes, thus validating the proposed concept for the design of the implant incorporating a functional gradient and auto-stability...|$|E
40|$|Aim. The laparoscopic {{approach}} in urological surgery demands {{a high degree}} of skill in intracorporeal suturing and knot tying. In an effort {{to reduce the amount of}} time required to perform a suture, new materials have been developed that through <b>self-anchorage</b> distribute tension more evenly across the suture and also eliminate the need of knot tying. The goal of this study was to assess the in vivo tissue response to a novel material (V-Loc tm; Covidien) in comparison to established materials (Vicryl, PDS II), in the case of bladder suturing, in a rat model. Methods. The study included 48 male Wistar rats. All underwent a median abdominal incision, with a 1 cm cystotomy, followed by a running suture. The suture material used was either V-Loc absorbable self anchoring thread, Vicryl threaded absorbable suture or monofilament absorbable suture. The abdominal cavity and the bladder suture were macroscopically evaluated at the rats ' scheduled death at 3 and 6 weeks. The bladder wall was microscopically assessed by a pathologist, with regard to tissue reaction and suture material degradation. Results. All rats survived the procedure, with the abdominal scar fully healed a...|$|E
