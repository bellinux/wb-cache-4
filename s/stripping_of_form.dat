40|$|Abstract: The {{paper is}} devoted to {{studying}} uniformly strongly hyperbolic matrices P(z,ξ), where z ∈dand ξ ∈n. It is proved that if the characteristic roots of P(z,ξ) are outside a <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> the <b>form</b> |Imτ|< δ, {{then there is a}} Hermitian smooth matrix function Q(z,ξ) with eigenvalues separated from zero uniformly with respect to (z,ξ) such that i(P*Q-QP) ≥ Q. To establish this assertion, we refine well-known results on the transformation of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous hyperbolic matrices to the diagonal and block-diagonal forms, respectively. The results obtained in this article will be used in forthcoming papers to investigate large-time behavior of solutions to first-order strongly hyperbolic systems.

30|$|Iris folding is an art-form {{consisting}} <b>of</b> layered <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> paper, <b>forming</b> {{a spiral}} pattern behind an aperture, {{which can be}} used to make cards and gift tags. This paper describes an interactive computational tool to assist in the design and construction of original iris folding patterns. The design of iris folding patterns is formulated as the calculation of a circumscribed polygonal sequence around a seed polygon. While it is possible to compute the positions of vertices analytically for a regular polygon, it is not straightforward to do so for irregular polygons. We give a numerical method for irregular polygons, which can be applied to arbitrary convex seed polygons. The user can quickly experiment with various patterns using the system prior to constructing the art-form.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{comparative}} study on factors effecting temperature rise {{and the state}} of thermal stresses inside a thick concrete section were investigated analytically. A finite-difference model was adopted to solve diffusion of internal heat generated by chemical reaction between cement and water. The model provides a continuous time-temperature history used to calculate thermal stresses. These stresses are influenced by developing mechanical properties and high creep rates at early age of concrete. The influence of several factors on temperature rise, thermal stresses and their peak value/ timing were studied. Among these factors are section thickness, <b>form</b> thickness, <b>stripping</b> time <b>of</b> <b>form,</b> placing temperature <b>of</b> concrete mix and cement type and content.
