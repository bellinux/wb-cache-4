50|$|The {{reasons given}} for this {{approach}} to power supply are that it eliminates cross-load problems, simplifies and reduces internal wiring that can affect airflow and cooling, reduces costs, increases power supply efficiency, and reduces noise by bringing the power <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> speed {{under the control of}} the motherboard.|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} computers, the rear fan and power <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> exhaust, moving hot air {{away from the}} computer. This causes a slight {{depressurization}} inside the chassis, and requires all other openings to become intake vents. Airflow {{from the front of}} the chassis moves around the Chassis Air Guide, allowing the processor fan to only draw air from outside the chassis, providing more effective cooling.|$|E

50|$|Warm, {{moist air}} is {{drawn into the}} unit at A in the diagram above. This air passes into a {{crossflow}} plate heat exchanger (B) where a substantial proportion of the sensible heat is transferred to a cool supply air stream. This process brings the extracted air close to saturation. The air then passes to the plenum chamber of the extract fan (C) where a portion of it may be rejected to outside. The amount that is rejected can be varied and is determined either by legislation on fresh air requirements, or by the requirement to maintain a fresh, odour free environment. The balance of the air then passes into the evaporator coil of the heat pump where it is cooled and the moisture is condensed. This process yields substantial amounts of latent energy to the refrigeration circuit. Fresh air is then introduced to replace the amount that was extracted and the mix is discharged by the <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> (G) to the crossflow plate exchanger (B) where it is heated by the extract air from the pool. This pre-warmed air then passes through the heat pump condenser (F) where it is heated by the latent energy removed during the condensation process {{as well as the}} energy input to the compressor. The warm dry air is then discharged to the room.|$|E
5000|$|In 1951 GM {{incorporated}} {{several small}} body, mechanical and electrical improvements into the model, {{enough to warrant}} the change once again of the model number to PD-4103. The easiest spotting features of a PD-4103 over the rare PD-4102 are that the later model included a rear luggage bay door {{on the left side}} that did not appear on either the PD-4101 or PD-4102, as well as an improved refrigeration system, using the same Ingersoll-Rand rotary vane compressor as previous models, but with a larger evaporator coil using a better expansion valve and a larger <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> located over the rear passengers' seats. To further improve air circulation and fresh air intake, exhaust fans were incorporated into the soffit at the head of each interior luggage rack, which operated from the same rheostat that controlled the main blower. Also included was a new, higher rated Delco generator and an improved voltage regulator, a redesigned reverse gear solenoid on the transmission, various evolutionary improvements to the 6-71 GM Diesel (tougher alloy exhaust valves and improved S-55 injectors as standard) and other miscellaneous minor improvements, including the addition of a [...] "black light" [...] instrument panel, in which the instruments had radium painted figures, very similar to what Ford introduced on their 1950 Ford passenger cars. Production of this bus totaled 1,501 with Greyhound Lines buying a substantial quantity. Many also operated for Trailways and other operators. Trailways sorely needed the GM Diesels, as the Hall-Scott 190-powered IC41 Brills had notoriously heavy fuel consumption, often achieving only 1.5 to 2 miles per gallon on a route on which a PD-4103 could easily get 7 on cheaper #1 Diesel fuel. The Brills, however, were far more powerful, and much faster than the PD-4103s on the flat. The PD-4103 was the first GM Coach offered with an optional restroom, or with facilities for an optional food buffet, a feature used on many cars ordered by Trailways. The PD-4103 restroom was problematic, as the overhead for the refrigeration unit and engine air intake severely restricted headroom. This problem was rectified in the successor PD-4104, which set the pattern for bus restrooms for all manufacturers for the next 50 years.|$|E

Therefore a new DS controller, which was intended for improving the DS control performance when the fluctuation of operating DS was resulted from speed changes, has been developed and its controllability tested. The test results showed that this new DS controller, which replaced the conventional PID DS controller, can significantly improve DS control performance after speed changes while indoor air temperature and humidity were controlled to their respective settings. With the improved DS control performance, the operating efficiency and stability of the DX A/Csystem were also enhanced. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|An {{artificial}} {{neural network}} (ANN) -based dynamic model for an experimental variable speed direct expansion (DX) air conditioning (A/C) system has been developed, linking the indoor air temperature and humidity controlled by the DX A/C system with the variations of compressor and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> speeds.

40|$|The {{instability}} in a refrigeration system, conventionally known as hunting, is the phenomena of the oscillation of certain system operational parameters {{such as the}} degree of refrigerant superheat (DS), refrigerant mass flow rate and evaporating pressure. Hunting has been noticed in not only the refrigeration systems controlled by thermostatic expansion valves (TEVs), but also those controlled by electronic expansion valves (EEVs), and hence attracted {{a lot of research}} interest. However, no previous studies on the impacts of both the operational parameters of an EEV and the simultaneous variation of compressor and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> speed in a variable speed (VS) direct expansion (DX) air conditioning (A/C) system may be identified. Â This paper reports on a modeling study on the operational stability of a VS DX A/C system. An existing detailed, physical based dynamic model for a VS DX A/C system has been further developed by adding equations for both the temperature sensor in an EEV and the air side of the evaporator. Using this further developed model, a modeling study on the stability of a VS DX A/C system based on the classical minimal-stable-signal (MSS) theory has been carried out. The effects of the dynamics of the temperature sensor, Proportional-Integral (PI) control settings of the EEV and variable speed operation of both compressor and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> on the operational stability of the VS DX A/C system have been investigated. The modelling results demonstrated that increasing the time constant of the temperature sensor would help mitigating the system instability, and increasing the compressor speed or decreasing the <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> speed would lead to the movement of a mixture-vapor transition point towards evaporator exit, leading to potential instability of the VS DX A/C system. ...|$|E

40|$|Controlling indoor {{humidity}} at {{an appropriate}} level {{is very important}} since this affects occupants' thermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ). The paper presents an investigation on developing a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) control strategy for simultaneously controlling the indoor air temperature and humidity by varying the speeds of both compressor and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> in an experimental DX A/C system. The MIMO-based controller was designed based on the linearized dynamic model of the experimental DX A/C system. The Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) technique was used in designing the MIMO-based controller. The controllability tests with respect to both the disturbance rejection capability and the command following capability were carried out to assess the control performance of MIMO controller. The results of disturbance rejection capability test showed that the MIMO control strategy can effectively maintain the indoor air temperature and humidity to their respective settings after an unmeasured heat load disturbance was imposed by simultaneously varying speeds of both the compressor and the <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> of the DX A/C system. Furthermore, in the command following capability test for indoor air temperature, the test {{results showed that the}} indoor air temperature can be controlled to its new setting while indoor humidity remained unchanged. Similar test results were also observed in the command following capability test for indoor humidity. Therefore, the MIMO controller developed can effectively control indoor air temperature and humidity simultaneously by varying compressor speed and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> speed of the DX A/C system. Compared to the previous related studies using conventional on-off control method or single-input single-output (SISO) control strategy, which can only effectively control either air temperature or relative humidity, the MIMO controller can simultaneously control the indoor air temperature and humidity with adequate control sensitivity and accuracy. The application of MIMO control strategy developed can be extended to other HVAC systems in the future to improve their operating performance and energy efficiency.

Using an experimental VS DX A/C system, the inherent correlations between its output total cooling capacity (TCC) and equipment sensible heat ratio (E SHR) at different combinations of compressor speed and <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> speed were studied and the unstable operating points of speed combinations under different DS settings and inlet air states identified. The experimental results suggested while different DS settings may not significantly influence the inherent correlations between TCC and E SHR, but did impact the operational stability. A lower DS setting would result in a larger unstable operating region. Furthermore, VS operation and different inlet air states to the DX evaporator also influenced the operational stability.
