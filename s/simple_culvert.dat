25|$|Combining a small culvert Fence with a Pond Leveler Pipe {{is another}} {{effective}} method to protect culverts from beaver damming. The culvert fence is made {{small enough to}} encourage the beavers to dam on it, but the resulting pond is prevented from rising to a dangerous level by a Pond Leveler Pipe installed through the culvert fence. The Fence and Pipe flow device needs very little maintenance and limits where and how high the beavers can dam; however, to be most effective, the intake end of the pipe should usually sit in at least 3 feet of water. When this water depth is not possible, a <b>simple</b> <b>Culvert</b> Protective Fence {{may be the best}} option.|$|E
40|$|The {{features}} of culvert flow in a basic arrangement are highlighted. Four fundamental flow types may be identified, namely critical flow, uniform flow, gated flow, and pressurized flow. A generalized design diagram is presented for the circular barrel {{that gives the}} possible transitions between various flow types. Further, the lengths of free surface flows with a central pressurized flow portion are determined {{as a function of}} the pipe Froude number. Photographs of model tests illustrate the complex flow patterns that may occur even in a <b>simple</b> <b>culvert</b> arrangement. Of particular relevance are choking conditions and {{features of}} two-phase flow in a culvert. The effects of friction coefficient, bottom slope, relative pipe length, and upstream head are detailed for free culvert outlet conditions...|$|E

This article gives a brief information on the latter...|$|R
