25|$|Dual-sports, {{sometimes}} called dual-purpose or on/off-road motorcycles, are street legal machines {{that are also}} designed to enter off-road situations. Typically based on a dirt bike chassis, they have added lights, mirrors, signals, and instruments that allow them to be licensed for public roads. They are higher than other street bikes, with a high center of gravity and tall seat height, allowing good <b>suspension</b> <b>travel</b> for rough ground.|$|E
25|$|The V8 Vantage N24 was {{featured}} in the BBC television series Top Gear, selected by James May in the presenters' quest {{to find the best}} driving road in Europe. Based on a grand tourer—less seat padding, air conditioning, <b>suspension</b> <b>travel,</b> and other comforts—the N24 was mocked by co-hosts Richard Hammond and Jeremy Clarkson as an ill-considered choice. May eventually had to drive naked, while pouring bottles of cold water over himself.|$|E
25|$|The chassis {{design was}} as new as the bodies - with an all-new, {{sturdier}} perimeter frame, new chassis/body mounts, larger 8½inch rear axle, wider 6-inch wheel rim width, refined rear control arm bushings, increased {{front and rear}} <b>suspension</b> <b>travel,</b> new shock absorber location, and improved front suspension geometry - The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive camber than the right {{which resulted in a}} more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all '73 Chevelles. John Z. DeLorean, Chevrolet's dynamic general manager during the design phase of the new Chevelles, left just as they were being announced. He departed in late September 1972 to start a brief stint as vice president of General Motors's Car and Truck Group. DeLorean left the new Chevelle an important legacy, though. He and Alex Mair, then Chevrolet's chief engineer, championed great handling. Critics compared the GM Colonnade line favorably to Ford and Chrysler intermediates which had unattractive styling and less interior room.|$|E
50|$|Long <b>travel</b> <b>suspension</b> {{is often}} used in the off road racing industry. Vehicles such as dune buggies, baja racers and rock {{crawlers}} use long <b>travel</b> <b>suspension</b> to dampen the effects of, rough, off-road driving conditions.|$|R

30|$|The {{mathematical}} model is non linear and has 14 DOF (see Fig.  3), {{corresponding to the}} position and orientation of the chassis, the steering angle, {{the front and rear}} <b>suspension</b> <b>travels,</b> the front and rear wheel rotations, the engine spin rate, the front fork bending deflection and the sprocket absorber deflection. There are 7 motorcycle inputs: steering torque, throttle position, rear and front brake torques, gears selected, clutch position and the foot pegs effort (as an indirect measure of the rider’s torso motion). Suspensions and tires are modelled in detail, as well as the clutch, the gearbox and the engine. More details are given in references [9, 10].|$|R
500|$|The {{engine and}} {{transmission}} were mounted {{together on the}} swingarm {{in front of the}} pivot axle {{at the bottom of the}} spine frame. The near-horizontal engine and transmission together as a unit formed a [...] "power egg" [...] style which would later be used by Benelli and Motobi. The tubular swingarm also served as the exhaust pipe. Behind the pivot axle, the swingarm, the reinforced rear fender, and the supports for the rear carrier formed a triangular structure which supported the rear spring. This suspension system allowed a long <b>suspension</b> <b>travel</b> and a soft spring rate. Test rides on the complete prototype began in December 1947 and showed that the combination of long travel and soft springs needed damping. Friction dampers were added.|$|E
500|$|With the {{championship}} returning to Asia {{for the second}} round of flyaway races, the team arrived in Singapore confident of scoring points; despite both cars advancing to the second period of qualifying and running in the top ten throughout the race, both cars retired with gearbox problems. Alonso was forced out after his car kept selecting neutral without input—a problem that affected several drivers; Button was involved in contact with Pastor Maldonado while trying to pass the slow-moving Alexander Rossi during a safety car restart before his gearbox overheated. After experimenting with a new front wing designed to improve air flow around the front tyres during free practice in Singapore, the team introduced the parts at the next race in Japan one week later. However, the team struggled with tyre pressures; following Sebastian Vettel's high-speed tyre blow-out during the Belgian Grand Prix, the FIA introduced a mandatory minimum tyre pressure setting on the advice of tyre supplier Pirelli. For the Japanese Grand Prix, these pressures were raised by [...] compared to the levels used during the 2014 race, which affected the MP4-30's ride height and vertical <b>suspension</b> <b>travel</b> and produced increased understeer. Despite taking advantage of grid penalties that saw them start twelfth and fourteenth respectively, Alonso and Button went on to finish eleventh and sixteenth. With the team acknowledging that the Singapore Grand Prix had represented their final opportunity to score points on merit, their focus shifted to development of their 2016 car over the final leg of {{the championship}}. In addition to the engine upgrades Honda brought to Russia, the team sought to use the high-speed and low-degradation characteristics of the Sochi Autodrom circuit to test experimental bodywork parts, including the exhaust configuration. In a race of attrition, both Button and Alonso initially finished in the points, with Button in ninth and Alonso taking tenth until Alonso was given a five-second penalty after the race that relegated him to eleventh place.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the performance of a full car model active suspension system using LQR controller. Dynamic model used in this study is a linear model. A linear model can capture basic performances of vehicle suspension such as body displacement, body acceleration, wheel displacement, wheel deflection, <b>suspension</b> <b>travels,</b> pitch and yawn. Performance of suspension system is determined by the ride comfort and vehicle handling. It can be measured by car body displacement and wheel displacement performance. Two types of road profiles are used as input for the system. Simulation is based on the mathematical model by using MATLAB/SIMULINK software. Results show that the performance of body displacement and wheel displacement can be improved by using Linear Quadratic Regulator control (LQR) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: According to the {{indicator}} diagram of damper, {{the indicator}} diagram plumpness was proposed as a quantitative index, and its mathematical {{relationships with the}} sprung mass acceleration, <b>suspension</b> dynamic <b>travel</b> and tire dynamic load were built. Moreover, {{the influence of the}} total area on suspension characteristics was analyzed in time domain and frequency domain. The results show that, the increase of the indicator diagram plumpness can effectively restrain the variation of <b>suspension</b> dynamic <b>travel</b> and tire dynamic load, meanwhile, the body acceleration will be enlarged. Excessive indicator diagram plumpness also affects the dynamic tire load distribution in frequency domain, and it will decrease the driving security. Therefore, it should be reasonably selected from the performance indicators, which is based on the requirement of vehicle demand in the design process. ...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are various}} types of {{off-road}} motorcycles, also known as dirt bikes, specially designed for off-road events. The term off-road refers to driving surfaces that are not conventionally paved. These are rough surfaces, often created naturally, such as sand, gravel, a river, mud or snow. These types of terrain can sometimes only be travelled on with vehicles designed for off-road driving (such as SUVs, ATVs, snowmobiles and mountain bikes) or vehicles that have off-road equipment. Compared to road-going motorcycles, off-road machines are simpler and lighter, having long <b>suspension</b> <b>travel,</b> high ground clearance, and rugged construction with little bodywork and no fairings for less damage in spills. [...] Wheels (usually 21" [...] front, 18" [...] rear) have knobby tires, often clamped to the rim with a rim lock.|$|E
2500|$|The {{swinging}} {{arms are}} mounted with large bearings to [...] "cross tubes" [...] that run {{side to side}} across the chassis; combined {{with the effects of}} all-independent soft springing and excellent damping, keeps the road wheels in contact with the road surface and parallel to each other across the axles at high angles of body roll. A larger than conventional steering castor angle, ensures that the front wheels are closer to vertical than the rears, when cornering hard with a lot of body roll. The soft springing, long <b>suspension</b> <b>travel</b> and the use of leading and trailing arms means that as the body rolls during cornering the wheelbase {{on the inside of the}} corner increases while the wheelbase on the outside of the corner decreases. As the corning forces put more of the car's weight on the inside pair of wheels the wheelbase extends in proportion, keeping the car's weight balance and centre of grip constant. promoting excellent road holding. The other key factor in the quality of its road holding is the very low and forward centre of gravity, provided by the position of the engine and transmission.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{is to develop a}} test method which will {{consider}} the variation of the ground clearance when driving, the so-called dynamic ground clearance. This has been done through the analysis of a specific application: the tractors in grain used in Brazil. Series of real life tests are run in order to obtain data on the tire compressions and the <b>suspension</b> <b>travels.</b> The tractor used is a 6 x 4 and is loaded with a trailer. When investigating critical cases, the minimum dynamic ground clearance is found to be as small as 123 mm at the axle 1, 78 mm at the exhaust outlet, 137 mm at the fuel tank, 35 mm at the bumper and 213 mm at the axle 2. These data will be transmitted to the engineer responsible for the chassis design in order for him to get {{a better understanding of the}} motion of the truck relative to ground...|$|R
50|$|Of similar {{construction}} to a {{hydraulic shock absorber}} the strut used {{the motion of the}} <b>suspension</b> <b>travelling</b> over bumps to pump itself back up to a pre-set height. It was sufficiently powerful to regain up to 85% of normal ride height with a full load over the rear axle, and had the advantage of requiring no external power source or a dedicated hydraulic system in the vehicle. The same system was applied to the Land Rover in the 1980s when these vehicles adopted the Range Rover's coil spring suspension. In the 1990s Land Rover, in pursuit of the same blend of on- and off-road ability, developed an air suspension system that was both self-levelling and height adjustable. Originally this was in conjunction with live axles but it is now used with fully independent suspension using wishbones. The original coil-springs-with-hydraulic-strut system is still used on certain models of the current Land Rover Defender.|$|R
