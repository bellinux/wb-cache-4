2500|$|Fran Walsh {{suggested}} to Peter Jackson (who was noted for horror-comedy films) that they write {{a film about}} the notorious Parker-Hulme murder. Jackson took the idea to his long-time collaborator, producer Jim Booth (who died after filming). The three filmmakers decided that the film should {{tell the story of}} the friendship between the two girls rather than focus on the murder and trial. [...] "The friendship was for the most part a rich and rewarding one, and we tried to honour that in the film. It was our intention to make a film about a friendship that went terribly wrong," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Peter</b> Jackson.|$|E

2500|$|A {{controversy}} arose {{with this}} production after Faye Dunaway {{was hired to}} replace Glenn Close. Dunaway went into rehearsals with Rex Smith as Joe and Jon Cypher as Max. Tickets went on sale for Dunaway's engagement but shortly after rehearsals started the producers announced that Dunaway was unable to sing the role to their standards and the production would shut down when Close left.

However, {{for people who do}} not want device fingerprinting, there are ways to attempt to block fingerprinting. The only ways to stop device fingerprinting cause web browsing to be very slow and websites to display information incorrectly. “There are not convenient options for privacy when it comes to device fingerprinting” <b>said</b> <b>Peter</b> Eckersely a staff scientist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and privacy-advocacy group. [...] Trying to avoid device fingerprinting is mostly just impractical and inconvenient. Fingerprints are tough to avoid because they are taken from data that are routinely passed from computers to websites automatically. Even if someone changes something slightly, the fingerprinters can still recognize the machine. There is one way to figure out that a device is being fingerprinted. The software JavaScript can be used to collect fingerprinting data. If it asks a browser for specific information, that could be a clue that a fingerprinter is working. Companies that are most known for conducting fingerprinting are advertisers.|$|E

6000|$|... "More'n half a mile, if {{it comes}} to that," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Peters,</b> gloomily. He paused in putting on his {{overcoat}} as if thinking better of it, while even the more fortunate and contiguous Wingate languidly lapsed against the counter again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think your}} partner sees," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Peters,</b> meaningly, and Wyndham {{advanced}} {{a few steps}} with his fist clenched. His eyes shone and the veins on his forehead swelled; but when Marston thought he would seize the other he stopped a yard or two off.|$|R
