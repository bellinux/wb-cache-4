25|$|Originally the Kouros type {{represented}} the archaic-thought that nature expresses itself in ideal everlasting simple-forms {{which can be}} traced by the senses and depicted in a way of illusive-reality. Matter was not regarded lifeless but something full of life, in an almost animistic belief. These ideas <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> parallel with the natural- philosophical conceptions of Thales from Miletus who searched a simple material-form behind the appearances of the things and also believed that matter was alive (υλοζωϊσμός). This material character is paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of blooming life through unnaturally simplified forms.|$|E
25|$|After King Alexander died without heirs, {{the general}} {{elections}} {{scheduled to be}} held on November 1, 1920 suddenly {{became the focus of}} a new conflict between the supporters of Venizelos and the Royalists. The anti-Venizelist faction campaigned on the basis of accusations of internal mismanagement and authoritarian attitudes of the government, which, due to the war, had stayed in power without elections since 1915. At the same time they promoted the idea of disengagement in Asia Minor, without though presenting a clear plan as to how this would happen. On the contrary, Venizelos was identified with the continuation of a war that did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> anywhere. The majority of the Greek people were both war-weary and tired of the almost dictatorial regime of the Venizelists, so opted for change. To the surprise of many, Venizelos won only 118 out of the total 369 seats. The crushing defeat obliged Venizelos and a number of his closest supporters to leave the country. To this day his rationale to call elections at that time is questioned.|$|E

25|$|Non-financial cooperatives - such as {{fishermen}} coop or farmers coops of the Antigonish movement, {{continue to}} provide an alternative economic model the world over despite rise of private sector led economic growth, especially for small producers and farmers in accessing markets and negotiating prices collectively. Within Maritimes though, such cooperatives seem to {{have given way to}} more individual enterprises that operate more as 'association' rather than collective business, but continuing to have a very close sense of 'community' and collective identity - be it lobster fishers or dairy farmers. Newer form of economic enterprises of recent times are also generally termed as 'social enterprises' - with dual objective of profit and socially responsible and positive outcomes. Such enterprises don't always have collective ownership, but almost always have a sense of 'community' well-being. Investment Cooperatives are yet another form of collective enterprise, often getting formed to finance a community based enterprise such as alternative energy coop or local-food marketing coop. Shared-economy is yet another form of new wave idea that borrows from same coop principle of community sharing an economy more inclusively; though the potential conflict between the private and corporate profit v/s community benefiting collectively continues to be an ongoing debate; a debate that Antigonish Movement challenged in 1920 and 1930s, and <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through in cyclical fashion ever-since. Societies are once again at cross-roads for balancing between individual and corporate wealth, group / cooperative enterprises, and more shared-economies where everyone can share benefits. Legacy and lessons from the Antigonish Movement continue to be relevant in our modern times.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Arthur Pierson, and was produced by Glenn Goodwin, while Wayne Isham {{was in charge of}} photography. At the time of the song's release, Madonna's style of dress was catching on as a fashion statement among club kids and her fans. The most prominent among her fashion accessories were the crucifixes she wore as earrings and necklaces. Madonna commented that wearing a rosary and a crucifix is [...] "kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheeks. Besides, the crucifixes <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with my name." [...] In reality, she was trying to find a separate image for herself, being inspired by then artists like Boy George, Cyndi Lauper and David Bowie, and their constantly shifting image and persona. Madonna realized the importance of her music videos and its popularity via MTV—launched in 1981—was instrumental in popularizing her image.|$|E
500|$|The songwriting session—held at Absolute's studio {{located on}} Tagg's Island near Chertsey—did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{well at the}} beginning, as the duo was heavily into R music at the time, while the group {{according}} to Wilson was [...] "always very poptastic". After two sessions the duo phoned their managers {{and told them that}} the musical association between them and the group was not working. At this point, the duo heard [...] "Wannabe" [...] for the first time, Wilson remembers: [...] "We listen to it, and we didn't get it at all. It was so different to what we were doing. We thought, 'How's this gonna work? We're not the right people to be doing this band.'" [...] For the next session the group wanted to write something uptempo and a bit more fun. A full-on disco backing track came up, and [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] evolved from there. Wilson commented about that session: ...|$|E

500|$|Axelrod {{composed}} Song of Innocence in {{one week}} and began recording in mid-1968. He recorded the album at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles and enlisted his close-knit group of veteran studio musicians, including keyboardist and conductor Don Randi, guitarist Al Casey, bassist Carol Kaye, and drummer Earl Palmer. He had worked with them when producing sessions for other recording artists. Axelrod did not play any instruments on Song of Innocence; he instead wrote arrangements for his orchestra and utilized 33players to perform his notated charts. He {{had learned how to}} read and orchestrate complex music charts from jazz musicians during the 1950s. Randi conducted the orchestra and played both piano and organ on the record. Axelrod preferred listening to a session from a recording booth like his contemporary Igor Stravinsky. [...] "That way the sounds don't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> all over the place", he later said. [...] "Music seems so small in a studio." [...] Axelrod originally wanted some of the album's compositions to feature a large-scale choir but was uncertain if he could find the appropriate ensemble, so he recorded an entirely instrumental album and included one Blake setting for each section of the score.|$|E
500|$|The band, and {{especially}} Richards, are noted for their perfectionism. In a post-Sunset Studies interview with Grok magazine in 2000, Williams criticised the song [...] "The Good Gardener (On How He Fell)", {{to which the}} interviewer noted [...] "the Augie March perfectionism ... a slavish, romantic, almost passionate pursuit". This meme continued throughout Augie March's career; following the release of Moo, You Bloody Choir, Richards {{said he was not}} truly happy with anything he had produced so far. Ammendola agreed, and added that the band considered Moo, You Bloody Choir the weakest of their first three albums, and Sunset Studies the best. Richards later stated that he considered Watch Me Disappear his best album yet. Andrew Murfett wrote in The Age that for Augie March, [...] "creative tension, adverse circumstances and perfectionism <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> hand in hand". Whereas Augie March's first two albums saw Richards maintain control over production, Moo, You Bloody Choir and Watch Me Disappear [...] "became community projects", and for that reason Richards declared he was not as much a fan of the latter works, though other band members have described the songs on Watch Me Disappear as the band's best yet.|$|E

Lindsey Thomas of Rolling Stone named Dwight interrogating {{the workers in}} the Office after finding the joint {{in the parking lot}} one of the top twenty-five scenes from the show, ranking it at number fifteen. Alan Sepinwall of The Seattle Times wrote that [...] "'Drug Testing' (in which Rainn Wilson's supercilious Dwight paraded around the office wearing a Smokey Bear hat and carrying a coffee cup filled with undrinkable liquid)" [...] allowed the show to finally make [...] "The Leap." [...] Brendan Babish of DVD Verdict was pleased with the entry and awarded it an [...] "A–". He was pleased with the episode's emphasis on Dwight and called it [...] "a far better showcase for Dwight's many charms than 'Dwight's Speech'." [...] M. Giant of Television Without Pity awarded the episode an [...] "A". Not all reviews were so glowing. Michael Sciannamea of AOL TV was more critical of the episode and wrote that he [...] "didn't think this episode was so hot", calling the premise [...] "a good idea that didn't really take off". He also disliked Jim and Pam's subplot and called it [...] "rather childish" [...] and wrote that it [...] "didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> anywhere".|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in 1985 for the European market and re-packaged as Madonna: The First Album with a {{different}} artwork created by photographer George Holy. The cover features Madonna in similar style of dress to the original cover but this time with crucifix as her earrings. Madonna's trademark style was catching on as a fashion statement among club kids and fans, with her crucifix accessories becoming the jewelry of the moment. Madonna said that wearing a crucifix is [...] "kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheeks. Besides, the crucifixes <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with my name." [...] In 2001, Warner Bros. Records released a remastered version of the album with its original artwork and two bonus remix tracks of [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Lucky Star". Madonna dedicated the album to her father, Tony Ciccone, with whom her relationship had not been good until {{the release of the}} album. In an interview with Time magazine, Madonna said: [...] "My father had never believed that what I was doing here [...] was worthwhile, nor did he believe that I was up to any good.

2500|$|Many critics {{over the}} years have {{questioned}} the song's lyrical meaning, mainly the line, [...] "I want it that way."

[...] While analyzing the lyrics, Westhoff perceived that, [...] "None of the sentiments in the chorus <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with any of the other ones. Even worse, no further explanation is given for what 'that' is."

[...] Despite being critical of Alison Goldfrapp's [...] "wispy, ethereal, often impenetrable vocal approach", Dave Hughes of Slant Magazine opined that the album is [...] "most compelling for {{the way in which the}} band's regained austerity and naturalism contrasts with their more recent hedonism." [...] Kat Lister of the NME expressed that [...] "Seventh Tree is bound to ruffle a few electro-feathered fans, but there's no denying it's a venture that sets the pair into new experimental territory." [...] In a mixed review, Rolling Stones Christian Hoard felt that the [...] "slow pace can be a snooze", but wrote that the album [...] "still makes for good post-party chill-out music". Nate Patrin of Pitchfork Media was less impressed, stating that the album's ambience is [...] "so subtle and slow-moving it doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> anywhere, and it coasts on some frothy sense of pleasantness that evaporates the moment the song ends." ...|$|E
