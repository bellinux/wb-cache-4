5|$|On {{the morning}} of Friday, 29 December, the naked body {{of a young woman}} was found dumped at a lay-by on the A449 near the Worcestershire village of Hawford by a {{motorist}} who had stopped to change a windscreen wiper. Police sought to establish her identity, but were <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not that of Louise Smith, an 18-year-old clerical assistant who had vanished early on Christmas Day after attending a nightclub at Yate, Gloucestershire. Smith's body was discovered in February 1996 in Chipping Sodbury, South Gloucestershire.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, {{which not only}} made the building structurally strong, but also much more fire resistant than buildings in the past. As {{a result of being}} built {{on the site of the}} former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of the basement level in order to make <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively to coat the floors and walls of the basement, in order to make sure it stayed dry.|$|E
25|$|Washington D.C.'s The Faith took {{hardcore}} punk to {{new places}} in the early 1980s. Even during their existence, their music hinted at what was to come, softening the standard-issue hardcore approach somewhat with better-developed melodies and a more inward-looking perspective. To be <b>sure,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> high-energy, high-velocity punk, but its subtle deviations from the norm opened up new vistas for the D.C. scene.|$|E

25|$|Both {{sailed to}} Margarita in August 1819. The Emily, a {{merchant}} ship under Captain Spilman, sailing with cargo to Alexandria, Virginia, found the brig Wilson. Almeida hailed the Emily and after making <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an American ship, let it go. When they were talking, a schooner with 23 guns stopped the Emily again: {{this time it}} was the Almeyda, and Captain Wilson came aboard. This time it was decided that the cargo of sugar, coffee, and leather was Spanish, so Wilson seized them.|$|E
25|$|As a {{conservative}} Christian, Boone declined certain songs and movie roles {{that he felt}} might compromise his beliefs—including a role with sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. In {{one of his first}} films, April Love, the director, Henry Levin, wanted him to give co-star Shirley Jones a kiss (which was not in the script). Since this would be his first onscreen kiss, Boone said that he wanted to talk to his wife first, to make <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all right with her. He had his own film production company, Cooga Mooga Productions.|$|E
25|$|At Rabaul, General Imamura {{was still}} {{convinced}} that the Allies {{did not mean to}} stay long at Torokina—he was <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just a stepping stone. He thus had no interest in mounting a decisive counterattack on the Allied beachhead using the substantial number of troops he already had {{in the southern part of}} Bougainville. Instead, he reinforced the Buka Island area, just off the north coast of the larger island, believing it to be the Allies' real target. Thus, the Army repeated the error of Guadalcanal, while the Navy could not convince Imamura of the Americans' real intentions.|$|E

25|$|On 16 March 1989, {{an engine}} {{fire broke out}} aboard Oregon II while she was moored at Mobile, Alabama. Her chief engineer, Mr. James V. Brosh, entered the smoke-filled engine room to make <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> clear of {{personnel}} before discharging carbon dioxide into the area to fight the fire. He later personally directed Mobile Fire Department firefighters in extinguishing the blaze. His actions were credited with limiting the damage and saving the ship, and for his courage and heroism in ensuring the safety of personnel and in fighting the fire, he received the Department of Commerce Silver Medal later in 1989.|$|E
25|$|Worship and temples {{appear to}} have been {{routinely}} offered by Greeks to their Roman governors, with varied reactions. Cicero declined a temple proposed by the city officials of Roman Asia to his brother and himself, while the latter was proconsul, to avoid jealousy from other Romans; when Cicero himself was Governor of Cilicia, he claimed to have accepted no statues, shrines, or chariots. His predecessor, Appius Claudius Pulcher, was so pleased, however, when the Cilicians built a temple to him that, when it was not finished at the end of Claudius' year in office, Claudius wrote Cicero to make <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> done, and complaining that Cicero was not active enough in the matter.|$|E
25|$|Once {{while serving}} as a doctor for the Peace Corps, a {{volunteer}} became seriously ill, and a doctor diagnosed malaria. The volunteer's condition progressively worsened, and Jemison was <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> meningitis with life-threatening complications {{that could not be}} treated in Sierra Leone. Jemison called for an Air Force hospital plane based in Germany for a military medical evacuation at a cost of $80,000. The embassy questioned whether Jemison had the authority to give such an order, but she told them she did not need anyone's permission for a medical decision. By the time the plane reached Germany with Jemison and the volunteer on board, she had been up with the patient for 56 hours. The patient survived.|$|E

25|$|After {{committing}} {{to build the}} statue, Blumberg was invited to Fort Campbell, where he met veterans of Task Force Dagger. He learned that his depiction of the Green Beret wasn't at all accurate. Blumberg invited them to his studio where they worked closely with him {{to be sure he}} got the horse and soldier precisely correct. Blumberg took six weeks to re-sculpt the piece until he was <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> accurate in every detail. It depicts a Special Forces Green Beret on horseback leading the invasion into Afghanistan. He is holding field glasses in one hand. An M4 with an attached grenade launcher is slung under his shoulder. An outline of a wedding band is visible under the glove of the soldier's left hand. Blumberg said, “That’s my way of tipping my hat to wives, marriages and strain on families. It’s to acknowledge the stresses caused by multiple deployments.” Blumberg created the sculpture's face without using a model or photos. It does not represent the face of a specific individual.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though he}} used over sixty mules, he knew to the item what {{each of them}} carried, where they were being {{delivered}} to {{and what he had}} to charge. And although he ran mule trains for over half a century he never lost a pound of cargo, except in one instance when his secundo, upon smelling a two-pound package of Limburger Cheese, decided it was rotten and threw it away. Once aware of the error, Cataline made <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> replaced and delivered. One of the best stories about him involves a loan that he had to make after a fatal disease had killed several of his mules. The bank manager questioned Cataline's collateral, wondering how many mules and horses he owned before consenting to lend him the money. When Cataline returned to the bank in the fall to repay the debt, he counted out the exact amount owing and paid it in full. The bank manager noted that Cataline had more money on his person and suggested that he deposit it in the bank. Cataline responded with a query as to how many horses and mules the bank owned, and upon learning it was none, decided to keep his money.|$|E

His other autobiographies included: Satyagraha in South Africa about his struggle there, Hind Swaraj or Indian Home Rule, a political pamphlet, and a paraphrase in Gujarati of John Ruskin's Unto This Last. This last essay can be considered his programme on economics. He also wrote extensively on vegetarianism, diet and health, religion, social reforms, etc. Gandhi usually wrote in Gujarati, though he also revised the Hindi and English translations of his books.|$|E
