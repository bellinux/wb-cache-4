25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary <b>starting</b> <b>motor</b> connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|E

During virtually all running conditions, including normal idle conditions, the alternator supplies primary electrical power.|$|E

During charging the cured paste was converted into electrochemically active material (the [...] "active mass") and gave {{a substantial increase in}} capacity compared with Planté's battery.

5000|$|Because inertia {{makes it}} {{difficult}} to instantly accelerate the rotor from stopped to synchronous speed, these motors normally require some sort of special feature to get started. Some include a squirrel-cage structure to bring the rotor close to synchronous speed. Various other designs use a small induction motor (which may share the same field coils and rotor as the synchronous motor) or a very light rotor with a one-way mechanism (to ensure that the rotor starts in the [...] "forward" [...] direction). In the latter instance, applying AC power creates chaotic (or seemingly chaotic) jumping movement back and forth; such a motor will always start, but lacking the anti-reversal mechanism, the direction it runs is unpredictable. The Hammond organ tone generator used a non-self-starting synchronous motor (until comparatively recently), and had an auxiliary conventional shaded-pole <b>starting</b> <b>motor.</b> A spring-loaded auxiliary manual starting switch connected power to this second motor for a few seconds.|$|E

50|$|The motor which {{drives the}} fan {{and the oil}} pump is usually a {{capacitor}} <b>start</b> <b>motor.</b> It is a vortex shortage tank motor because it also contains a short cage or cage holds. The difference with a three-phase motor is in the stator. Where the vortex power motor has three coils aligned at 120° in the stator, the capacitor <b>start</b> <b>motor</b> holds one main winding and one auxiliary winding aligned at 90°. The phase shift of 90° between the main winding and the auxiliary winding is achieved by a connected capacitor which feeds the auxiliary winding and is connected on the single-phase AC mains. The capacitor will achieve a phase shift of 90° between the main and the auxiliary winding, producing an acceptable initial torque. This motor is intended for continuous operation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{diesel engine}} is an twelve-cylinder, turbocharged, water-cooled, four-cycle, V-type engine usedto provide power. It is {{directly}} connected to the main generator. The traction motors are axle hung and supported on the truck transoms by spring-loaded suspension. One motor is geared to each axle through a single set of gears with a ratio of 14:72. The radiator keeps engine at proper operating temperature between 100 and 1980F (37.7 and 92.2°C). Two externally mounted battery boxes, {{one on each side}} of the locomotive, provide ventilated compartments to house the eight batteries. Two main reservoir tanks, one {{on each side of the}} locomotive, provide a means of storing air for the air system. The main generator furnishes direct-current power over a wide range of voltage at variousspeeds up to 1200 rpm. It is separately excited by the exciter generator mounted on the generator frame. The generator also acts as a <b>starting</b> <b>motor</b> when the start button is pushed and the battery switch is closed. The fuel tank can hold 500 gallons (1892 liters) of diesel fuel for engine operation. Two fill pipes and two sight glasses, one on each side of the locomotive, provide a means of filling the tank and monitoring the level of fuel. The blower provides forced ventilation for the traction motors which require adequate cooling. It is belt driven from the main generator shaft.|$|E
5000|$|With a Thermostart plug in {{the inlet}} manifold, {{within a few}} seconds diesel vapours start to fill the inlet manifold. As the plug {{continues}} to heat up, it opens a valve permitting diesel from a special reservoir mounted directly above the Thermostart into the Thermostart plug. This fresh diesel is also vaporised and adds {{to that in the}} inlet manifold. At 20 seconds, provided air is available, the diesel near the plug ignites and as the engine is cranked, the ignited diesel is drawn into the combustion chambers - to which more diesel is added after the compression stroke. This additional diesel immediately ignites, starting the engine with ease. Vehicles fitted with Thermostart glow plugs do not usually activate via the normal ignition switch. A button elsewhere is provided (along with, in some cases, the button to activate the <b>starting</b> <b>motor).</b> Where a Thermostart is activated by the same switch as the ignition, it is usually activated by turning the switch one 'notch' counter-clockwise. After the 20 second period has elapsed, cranking is achieved by turning the ignition switch a further notch counter-clockwise. Once the engine has fired and is running, the ignition switch is released, allowing it to spring back to the off position. The operator should then turn the ignition switch to the on position - usually one notch clockwise ...|$|E

The system includes (1) a digital counter which generates a count determined by the difference in frequency between the power line and a small current generated by the synchronous motor; (2) a latch which stores the count; and (3) a comparator which compares the stored count with a newly generated count to determine whether the synchronous motor is accelerating or decelerating. Signals generated by the counter and comparator control the current to a clutch that couples a <b>starting</b> <b>motor</b> to the large synchronous motor...|$|E
