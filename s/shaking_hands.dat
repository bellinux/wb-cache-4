2500|$|If {{there are}} [...] {{people who can}} <b>shake</b> <b>hands</b> with one another (where [...] ), the {{pigeonhole}} principle shows that {{there is always a}} pair of people who will <b>shake</b> <b>hands</b> with the same number of people. In this application of the principle, the 'hole' to which a person is assigned is the number of <b>hands</b> <b>shaken</b> by that person. Since each person <b>shakes</b> <b>hands</b> with some number of people from 0 to , there are [...] possible holes. On the other hand, either the '0' hole or the [...] hole or both must be empty, for it is impossible (if !) for some person to <b>shake</b> <b>hands</b> with everybody else while some person <b>shakes</b> <b>hands</b> with nobody.

Other witnesses, though, said that as Sirhan approached, Kennedy was turning to his left <b>shaking</b> <b>hands,</b> facing north and so exposing his right side.|$|E

Afterward, Punk apologized to Burke. The following week, Punk apologized again, but was forced by Burke to miss an eight-man elimination tag team match between the Originals and the New Breed.
