Adopting a false personality or impersonating a known figure to trick victims into <b>sharing</b> <b>personal</b> <b>details</b> can be done in person or via phone conversation.|$|E
50|$|Commonality is the {{technique}} of deliberately finding {{something in common with}} a person or a customer in order to build a sense of camaraderie and trust.This is done through references to shared interests, dislikes, and experiences. By <b>sharing</b> <b>personal</b> <b>details</b> or self-disclosing personal preferences or information, interlocutors can build commonality and thus increase rapport.|$|E
5000|$|The {{novel was}} well {{received}} by Daisy Wyatt, for The Independent, {{who found the}} novel [...] "difficult to fault", calling it [...] "fun and easy to relate to, while also having a positive message". Wyatt found, however, that [...] "while Girl Online does teach sound advice to teenagers about being cautious of their online activity", Sugg has [...] "found fame and fortune in <b>sharing</b> <b>personal</b> <b>details</b> on the internet" [...] and felt that her fans {{are more likely to}} copy her than the fictional Penny. The novel was well received in The Guardian with reviewer 'lilybelle' stating [...] "I could relate so much to everything" [...] and that [...] "This book inspired me... I literally feel as though I've changed overnight". She also found that Sugg [...] "made Penny a bit too similar to herself", making it [...] "confusing at times", but described the novel overall as [...] "special and inspiring." ...|$|E

50|$|Tannen {{highlighted}} the “Telling Your Day” ritual {{that takes place}} in many American families, in which, typically, the mother in a two-parent family encourages a child to share details (about his/her day which the mother has typically already heard about) with the father. She also emphasizes the common occurrence of the “troubles talk” ritual in women. This ritual involves a woman sharing details about “a frustrating experience” or other previously encountered problem with a confidant. She cites this ritual of an example of how, for many women, closeness is established through <b>sharing</b> <b>personal</b> <b>details.</b> As one example of gender-linked misinterpretations, Tannen points out that a man who is {{on the receiving end of}} “troubles talk” from his wife will often take the mention of a problem and how it was handled as an invitation to pass judgment, despite the fact that “troubles talk” is simply an expository experience meant to enhance emotional connections.|$|E
30|$|The “Twitter Egg” is {{the default}} {{picture of a}} newly created Twitter account. Knowing that a user has {{invested}} the effort to replace this picture by a profile picture could be taken as indication of both engagement and diligence. Similarly, if the user provides a valid location, rather than the empty default or a non-revealing “at home”, then this could indicate that the user is less concerned about privacy, more open in <b>sharing</b> <b>personal</b> <b>details,</b> and thus a more reliable social sensor. We hypothesize that, indeed, users with a more complete profile provide better data for now-casting.|$|E

Celibate for about 35 years since his forties, in 2008 he began a friendship with writer and New York Times contributor Bill Hayes that slowly evolved into a committed long-term partnership that lasted until Sacks's death.

50|$|Another way of {{building}} rapport is by each partner indicating their attentiveness to the other. This attentiveness {{may take the}} form of nonverbal attentiveness, such as looking at the other person, nodding at appropriate moments, or physical proximity, as seen in work on teachers’ “immediacy” behaviors in the classroom. This attentiveness might also be demonstrated through reciprocation of nonverbal behaviors like smiling or nodding, similar to the coordination or in the reciprocal <b>sharing</b> of <b>personal</b> <b>details</b> about the other person that signal one’s knowledge and attentiveness to their needs.|$|R
40|$|Social {{platforms}} {{along with}} mobile devices allow individuals to <b>share</b> <b>personal</b> <b>details</b> with their peers. They also render individuals visible to institutions like marketers, employers {{and law enforcement}} agencies. These lead to troubling developments such as privacy violations, categorical discrimination, and {{a chilling effect on}} public speech. Moreover, we (users, but also researchers) are only learning about these in consequence, and are nevertheless coming to terms with online surveillance. Of particular importance {{is the extent to which}} individuals contribute to the visibility of peers and strangers alike. This presentation considers research on social media and big data in the context of user visibility and the ensuing social outcomes. Following an overview of a range of surveillance practices that have emerged on platforms like Facebook, this presentation will focus on recent examples of user-led surveillance and policing online. While these practices may be a form of resistance against state surveillance, so too can they reinforce or augment this surveillance, knowingly or otherwise. These dynamics pose a number of challenges for emerging scholars, and in particular reconciling individuals’ motivations and experiences with their digital traces is a pressing concer...|$|R

25|$|Turkle {{talks about}} the nature of privacy in the post 9/11 world, arguing that privacy was sacrificed in {{exchange}} for safety. Turkle argues that because they have grown up as part of a world in which privacy is regarded as increasingly tenuous, children do not always appreciate the full value of privacy, which in turn causes them to <b>share</b> even more <b>personal</b> <b>details</b> on the web. This further depreciates the value of privacy in a self-perpetuating cycle.|$|R

Even so, the project is ambitious logistically, so the two start trusting each other as Pete starts to find ways to make it work and build the actual props. The two start spending increasing amounts of free time together, initially talking about the float, but later <b>sharing</b> more <b>personal</b> <b>details,</b> becoming fast friends in the process.|$|R
50|$|The {{people of}} the local {{community}} frequently knew him for his keen memory. After his death, personal blogs and D.C. newspapers alike produced articles in memory of him, specifically mentioning his uncanny memory. Washington, D.C. journalist and professor, Terry Mattingly, an Orthodox Christian, referenced a conversation with Bis in which Bis wished him a happy Easter. After Mattingly had gone a few steps, Bis stopped him and recalled that Orthodox Easter was not until a week later. “He was right, of course. Had I <b>shared</b> that <b>personal</b> <b>detail</b> with him or did he glean that tidbit of liturgical minutia {{from one of the}} newspapers he read, day after day? Anyone who knew him could describe similar mysterious encounters,” wrote Mattingly in his column for Scripps Howard News Service.|$|R
40|$|For years, {{controversy}} has plagued the EU’s attempts {{to agree on}} a legal basis for <b>sharing</b> the <b>personal</b> <b>details</b> of airline passengers with the US. Now, opposition in the European Parliament may see this form of counter-terrorism cooperation rejected. The arguments are about more than record-keeping: they relate to the need to assure passenger security in the post- 9 / 11 era but also the risk that these security practices can pose to the privacy and personal liberty of normal citizens. This paper analyses the development of EU-US PNR data-sharing agreements as a case study for wider transatlantic security cooperation. Reviewing the key challenges from the PNR story presents a strong argument for the US to fully engage with the EU on “internal ” security measures that can assure transatlantic security externally. To fully maximize the opportunities however, agreements like PNR need independent oversight and redress procedures. Without such elements, failure on PNR is more likely and the possibilities for a wider transatlantic area of freedom, security and justice may narrow...|$|R
50|$|Development of a child's {{narrative}} {{identity is}} largely {{influenced by the}} opportunities for narrative expression {{he or she has}} through conversations with caregivers and friends. Speakers provide more accurate autobiographical information when speaking to attentive listeners as opposed to distracted listeners, therefore developing more specific autobiographical memories which give rise to richer personal narratives. Young children whose parents <b>share</b> more <b>detailed</b> <b>personal</b> narratives from their own lives tend to have more <b>detailed</b> and coherent <b>personal</b> narratives themselves {{by the end of the}} preschool age period. The ability to construct narratives in a life story framework and form an identity first emerges in adolescence - initiated during the adolescent struggle for identity formation, It plays a role in adulthood by supporting generativity, and it helps to foster meaning-making at the end of life.|$|R
40|$|Although {{understanding}} {{preferences for}} privacy {{is of great}} importance to economists, businesses and politicians {{little is known about}} the factors that shape the individual willingness to <b>share</b> <b>personal</b> data.

We find that participants' willingness to <b>share</b> <b>personal</b> data with anonymous recipients decreases with the number of recipients. However, social distance to the recipients and the extent of personal data a single recipient receives do not decrease the willingness to <b>share</b> <b>personal</b> data. Further, we provide a methodological insight by showing that verification of personal data is essential when eliciting privacy preferences...|$|R
