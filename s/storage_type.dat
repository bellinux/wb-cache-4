5000|$|Although Tephrosia vogelii is not {{consumed}} directly, {{it can be}} used {{to increase}} the yield of various crops. For example, leaf extracts of Tephrosia vogelii are used as chemical pesticides. Crops that have had this extract applied show significant decreases in insect and other pest activity. Therefore, crops can grow in areas that they could not before, if they are grown alongside Tephrosia vogelii. In fact, studies have shown a 46.2-52.2% decrease in grain damage. Grain damage was measured by the amount of kernels that were destroyed and also by the net weight loss of the crop. This number varies based on method of <b>storage,</b> <b>type</b> of insect measured, and type of stored grain. In one particular study, the extract killed 40% of the attacking insects after a 21-day period. This decrease is about what would be expected from most chemical pesticides.|$|E

It operates under 20 percent load factor under a range of maximum head of 36.77 m and minimum head of 25.6 m. The hydropower component involved construction of a 13.42 m high weir, 915 m below the Ujjani Dam to control the lower pond for operation during the pumping mode. A penstock pipe of 3.2 m diameter (12 mm thick) and 70 m length embedded in the dam diverts the flow of [...] from a gate controlled trash racks (15 panels) covered intake into the powerhouse. The lower pond in the pumped storage scheme of operation was built initially itself, soon after commissioning of the dam. The power plant {{is reported to be}} providing benefits since then. However, the power generation estimated initially at 105 GWh was expected to reduce to 21 GWh, as water was utilized for irrigation through the RBC and LBC canal systems.|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, the Apache Hadoop {{distributed}} file system (HDFS) {{has become increasingly}} popular for the storage of large data sets. Both {{the volume of the}} data and the variety of applications is unprecedented. The variety of tasks, each with its own access pattern and demands, calls for a file system that supports specialized storages for different tasks. This thesis describes the implementation of heterogeneous storage in HopsFS, a highly-available, highly-scalable version of HDFS. This makes the cluster aware of different <b>storage</b> <b>types</b> (e. g. hard disks and solid state drives) and allows users to specify preferred <b>storage</b> <b>types</b> for their data. By introducing new <b>storage</b> <b>types,</b> we build in support for storage technologies like SSDs and RAID. The latter is especially of interest, since it increases both bandwidth and reliability of the storage on individual nodes while continuing commodity hardware. Since network bandwidth is increasing orders of magnitude faster than disk bandwidth, increasing the disk throughput is of vital importance to avoid local storage becoming a bottleneck. The heterogeneous storage Application Programming Interface (API) described in this thesis offers HDFS administrators more control over their data while being compatible with the HDFS framework. Users can choose whether they want files stored on traditional disks, SSDs or more complex constructions using RAID and erasure coding...|$|R
