5|$|On <b>Speechless,</b> Frith {{continued}} his exploration of world folk and dance music {{that he had}} begun on Gravity, but unlike Gravity, <b>Speechless</b> included extensive use of found sounds and field recordings. Frith said {{that many of the}} tapes were made while walking the streets of New York City, and include street fairs and demonstrations. Recordings were also made while visiting friends: the title song's rhythm track is provided by a malfunctioning water pipe in Tim Hodgkinson's kitchen.|$|E

5|$|Bart {{learns that}} the couple {{have lost their jobs}} and feels remorseful. After Seymour apologizes to Bart for {{embarrassing}} him, Bart encourages the former principal to stand up for himself and Edna. Agreeing to Bart's comment, Seymour and Edna lock down the school, call the media (with Bart's help) and make their demands: They want their jobs back and the townspeople to not interfere with their relationship. However, several residents reply with their accusation about the two having sexual intercourse in the janitor's closet described by their children. Seymour insists nothing of the sort happened and that he is a virgin. At first, everyone is <b>speechless,</b> but being on the basis of being such an embarrassing thing for someone his age to admit, they {{think it has to be}} true. Realizing that they have overreacted over the relationship, the residents peacefully leave, believing that no one would pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin. Chalmers agrees to reinstate Seymour and Edna as though nothing ever happened, but insists that they keep their relationship at a minimum level during school days. The couple decide to continue their relationship more privately than ever by convincing Bart that they have broken up after thanking him for helping them. They then go back into their relationship and enter the janitor's closet where they presumably have sex.|$|E
5|$|Andriamampandry {{tried on}} several {{occasions}} to warn Andriamasinavalona {{of the danger of}} administering the kingdom in this way. In one instance, he placed a hen {{in the middle of a}} room, then set one red rooster free in each corner. The roosters attacked one another viciously, leaving the king <b>speechless.</b> On another day, the elder brought four eagles to the king in a basket. When the basket was opened, the eagles flew wildly about the room, creating havoc. Andriamampandry warned the king that his realm would be no better off once his four sons got a taste of power. Andriamasinavalona recognized the danger but could not bear to choose which among his sons should be excluded from having a part in the decision-making responsibilities of the kingdom, so ignored the elder's advice. Finally Andriamampandry decided to give the king a very explicit warning. Andriamasinavalona had gathered his people in Andohalo to give a speech, when Andriamampandry set a bull loose into the crowd. In the panic that ensued, numerous people were gored or trampled to death, several pregnant women miscarried, and the gathering dispersed in chaos. The king demanded to know who had loosed the bull so that he may be executed, but when Andriamampandry took responsibility he warned the king that yet more blood would be spilled before the earth would be quenched. He then criticized the king for his concern over the relatively few deaths at the gathering, in light of the number of people who would die as a consequence of his division of Imerina. He further predicted that the prince at Ambohimanga would unite Imerina and lead it back to greatness. Andriamasinavalona reportedly had no response to give Andriamampandry, but instead hung his head in shame.|$|E

In reality, Katie is at home, with nine stitches {{to the head}} after being hit with a rock by their friend Effy Stonem, who has disappeared. Katie is embarrassed about how her injuries look, and miserable {{over the loss of}} her boyfriend Freddie Mclair (Luke Pasqualino), who only dated her to spite Effy, his real love interest. She begins to take notice of all the hints in front of her, and realises that she can no longer hide from herself the fact that Emily is homosexual. At college, Naomi uncovers Emily's disguise (which had not fooled JJ or Freddie either) and tells her that she plans to spend the summer alone in Cyprus. When Emily tells Naomi that she will miss her, they kiss in an empty corridor and later find themselves at Naomi's house where they have sex. Afterward, Emily asks Naomi to the college ball, but Naomi, still crippled by insecurity over her sexuality, refuses, leaving Emily heartbroken. Emily leaves and at the bus stop meets Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba), who offers her his shoes and jacket and is unconcerned when she tells him that she is gay. He tries to comfort her but admits that he believes it impossible to stop loving somebody, referring to his ex-girlfriend Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell). Emily returns home and comes out to her family, telling them that she has been having sex with a girl named Naomi. Her father, Rob (John Bishop), dismisses it as a joke and her mother, Jenna (Ronni Ancona), is <b>speechless,</b> while Katie tries to deny it.

25|$|The very {{existence}} of the outer world seemed a base mockery, a cruel sham of some remembered possibility which had been glorious with a <b>speechless</b> beauty.

25|$|Sambhāvanā (Hindi: सम्भावना, meaning Competency): Sambhāvanā or {{competency}} is vividly {{described in}} the first ten verses of the canto.

The twelve-year olds Aṣṭāvakra and Śvetaketu run into Janaka, who {{is on his way}} to the court. Janaka asks his guards to get the handicapped boy out of his way. Aṣṭāvakra responds by saying that Janaka should get out of his way instead, as he (Aṣṭāvakra) is a Brāhmaṇa versed in the scriptures. Pleased with his brilliance, Janaka tells Aṣṭāvakra that he is free to roam anywhere in Mithilā. However, Janaka's gatekeeper does not let Aṣṭāvakra into the court, and tells him that only the learned and wise elders deserve to be in Janaka's court. Aṣṭāvakra makes the gatekeeper <b>speechless</b> by his definition of elders – only those grown in knowledge are the elders. The gatekeeper now lets him into an assembly consisting of sages like Yājñavalkya, Gārgī and Maitreyī. Aṣṭāvakra openly challenges Bandī for a scriptural debate. Janaka asks Aṣṭāvakra to satisfy him first in debate, and poses him six cryptic questions, which Aṣṭāvakra answers convincingly. Janaka offers him Bandī, who knows within himself he will lose to Aṣṭāvakra, but decides to openly debate. Bandī mocks Aṣṭāvakra's deformities and the assembly laughs. Aṣṭāvakra chides both Bandī and the assembly and declares his intention to leave the assembly.|$|E
