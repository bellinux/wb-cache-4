40|$|The Index of NACA Technical Publications covers reports {{issued from}} the date of origin of the Committee in 1915 until {{approximately}} September 1949. Because omissions were noted after publication of the Index issued in 1947, and since many new reports have been released since that time, {{it was decided to}} issue a new volume to supersede completely the 1947 Index, with supplements to be issued regularly in the future. Commencing with all publications issued after September 1, 1949, <b>subject</b> <b>classifications</b> were revised, the most important change involving the transfer of aircraft loads reports from the Aerodynamics classification to Structures. For those maintaining a file of NACA index cards, it is recommended that cards issued for reports dated prior to September 1, 1949 be removed from the file. This volume includes the same index information. Supplements covering periods following September 1, 1949, will be arranged according to the revised <b>subject</b> <b>classifications.</b> On the pages immediately following, the <b>subject</b> <b>classifications</b> are indexed in order of breakdown.

2500|$|Some {{mathematics}} is relevant {{only in the}} area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between pure mathematics and applied mathematics. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. number theory in cryptography. This remarkable fact, that even the [...] "purest" [...] mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what Eugene Wigner has called [...] "the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics". As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest Mathematics <b>Subject</b> <b>Classification</b> runs to 46pages. Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, operations research, and computer science.|$|E
