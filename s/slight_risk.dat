5|$|Ethylene glycol {{has a low}} vapor pressure; it {{does not}} {{evaporate}} readily at normal temperatures and therefore high concentrations in air or intoxication are unlikely to occur following inhalational exposures. There may be a <b>slight</b> <b>risk</b> of poisoning where mists or fogs are generated, although this rarely leads to poisoning as ethylene glycol causes irritation and coughing when breathed in, alerting victims to its presence. Ethylene glycol is not well absorbed through skin meaning poisoning following dermal exposure is also uncommon.|$|E
5|$|On November14, the National Weather Service {{issued a}} <b>slight</b> <b>risk</b> of severe weather {{for the early}} hours of November15 for the Carolinas and {{northern}} Gulf coast. Although conditions were not favorable for a large-scale severe weather event, the possibility of small clusters of thunderstorms existed. Strong wind shear was forecast to persist, which would allow small bow-echo line of thunderstorms which could produce damaging winds. The result of a weak disturbance which passed through the area of <b>slight</b> <b>risk</b> lowered the chances of tornadic thunderstorms developing. At 12:25a.m. EST, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a Tornado watch for most of eastern North Carolina. A broken line of thunderstorms had already developed and the risk of tornadoes greatly increased, with the chances of an EF2 or stronger touching down reaching 20%. The first tornado touched down shortly after in South Carolina. Over the following several hours, two supercell thunderstorms spawned seven more tornadoes throughout North Carolina. The final tornado dissipated around 4:36a.m. EST, just 3 hours and 46 minutes after the outbreak started. The tornado watch remained in effect until before being cancelled at 8:00a.m. EST.|$|E
5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a <b>slight</b> <b>risk</b> to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E

5|$|A {{moderate}} {{risk for}} severe weather was {{issued by the}} Storm Prediction Center two days prior to the event. The storm then moved across {{the most of the}} Midwest on October 18, where a moderate risk was in effect also for two days for most of Illinois, Indiana and parts of Kentucky, although the moderate risk was revised further to the south and east to include western Ohio, western Tennessee, southeastern Missouri, northeastern Arkansas and a larger portion of Kentucky while Michigan and Wisconsin were no longer under a moderate risk. A <b>slight</b> <b>risk</b> of severe weather was forecast for a large area from beyond the Canada–US border to the Florida Panhandle and Mobile Bay. Dew points above 70°F (21°C) were reported well into the Ohio Valley, and dew points above 60°F (16°C) were reported as far north as northern Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Day 4–8 outlooks are the longest-term {{official}} SPC Forecast Product, {{and often}} change significantly {{from day to}} day. This extended forecast for severe weather was an experimental product until March 22, 2007, when the Storm Prediction Center incorporated it as an official product. Areas are delineated in this forecast that have least a 15% or 30% chance of severe weather in the Day 4–8 period (equivalent to a <b>slight</b> <b>risk</b> and an enhanced risk, respectively); as forecaster confidence is not fully resolute on how severe weather will evolve more than three days out, the Day 4–8 outlook only outlines {{the areas in which}} severe thunderstorms are forecast to occur during the period at the 15% and 30% likelihood, and does not utilize other categorical risk areas or outline where general (non-severe) thunderstorm activity will occur.|$|E
5|$|The Bridge Creek–Moore tornado {{was part}} of a much larger outbreak, which {{produced}} 71 tornadoes across five states throughout the Central Plains on May 3 alone, along with an additional 25 that touched down a day later in some of the areas affected by the previous day's activity (some of which were spawned supercells that developed on the evening of May 3), stretching eastward to the Mississippi River Valley. On the morning of May 3, in its Day 1 Convective Outlook for the United States, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a <b>slight</b> <b>risk</b> for severe weather, as a dry line that stretched from western Kansas into western Texas approached a warm, humid air-mass over the Central Plains; the conditions ahead of the dry line and a connecting trough positioned over northeastern Colorado appeared to favor the development of thunderstorms later that day that would contain large hail, damaging straight-line winds, and isolated tornadoes.|$|E

5|$|The Storm Prediction Center(SPC) {{began to}} note the {{possibility}} that a severe weather event could develop on December30 as early as December25, 2010. Nonetheless, the predictability of the event was too low as the event was several days out. As the anticipated event grew closer, confidence in the forecast slowly increased, though uncertainties in the timing and extent of the tornado outbreak still existed. These uncertainties remained through December29 with forecasts calling for only marginal hail and possibly damaging gusts. However, the SPC indicated that supercells and more severe weather could result from atmospheric conditions deviating slightly from the forecast. In contrast, forecasts were more confident in a widespread outbreak of severe weather for New Year's Eve; the SPC issued a <b>slight</b> <b>risk</b> outlook for much of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Ozarks as a result.|$|E
25|$|On May 22, the Storm Prediction Center {{issued a}} <b>slight</b> <b>risk</b> of severe weather for {{portions}} of South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas.

25|$|On April 17, {{although}} the SPC issued a <b>slight</b> <b>risk</b> of storms, a storm system progressed through Texas. The system spawned ten tornadoes through northern Texas, such as Anton, Lubbock and Haslet, {{which is only}} a few miles from where a number of tornadoes hit the Friday before, April 13, 2007. The system also created penny to ping-pong ball-sized hail and created dangerous wind speeds. Six tornadoes were confirmed, one EF1 and the others all EF0.|$|E

25|$|In April 2007, the Cuba IPV Study Collaborative Group {{reported}} in the New England Journal of Medicine that inactivated (killed) poliovirus vaccine was effective in vaccinating children in tropical conditions. The Collaborative Group consisted of the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, Kourí Institute, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Pan American Health Organization, and the World Health Organization. This is important because countries with high incidence of polio are now using live oral poliovirus vaccine. When polio is eliminated in a country, they must stop using the live vaccine, {{because it has a}} <b>slight</b> <b>risk</b> of reverting to the dangerous form of polio. The collaborative group found that when polio is eliminated in a population, they could safely switch to killed vaccine and be protected from recurrent epidemics. Cuba has been free of polio since 1963, but continues with mass immunization campaigns.|$|E
25|$|On May 29, the Storm Prediction Center {{issued a}} {{moderate}} risk for parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The outlook included a 10% hatched risk for tornadoes. A separate <b>slight</b> <b>risk</b> was issued for parts of New England. In the main risk area, only scattered weak tornadoes touched down, though a mile-wide EF2 wedge tornado touched down in upstate New York near Schenectady. On May 30, {{for the second}} day in a row, the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk with a 10% hatched risk of tornadoes, this time for eastern Oklahoma and {{a small part of}} Kansas. Numerous tornadoes touched down in Oklahoma and Arkansas, including a few that were strong. An EF2 ripped through the Tulsa suburb of Broken Arrow, resulting in severe damage to homes and businesses. A brief EF1 near Tull, Arkansas unfortunately caused a fatality due to a falling tree.|$|E
25|$|A strong {{low-pressure}} area {{over the}} central Great Lakes {{and its associated}} cold front combined with intense wind shear to provide a favorable environment for supercell development. Despite only moderate instability (which meant only a <b>slight</b> <b>risk</b> of severe weather was issued by the Storm Prediction Center, and only modest probabilities for severe weather at first), supercells developed throughout the day {{over much of the}} central US and continued throughout the evening and overnight hours, continuing into the morning of January 8. The hardest-hit area was in the Ozarks, around Springfield, Missouri, where nearly continuous supercells developed throughout the evening, resulting in numerous tornado touchdowns. In addition to the tornadoes, hail larger than baseballs and damaging straight-line downburst winds as strong as 100mph (160km/h) were reported. At least three people were killed in Missouri {{as a result of the}} tornadoes. Two of these deaths occurred near Marshfield and there were also six injuries.|$|E

25|$|Vigorous tornado {{activity}} {{continued on}} May 28. While the Storm Prediction Center only issued a <b>slight</b> <b>risk</b> that day, widespread tornadoes touched down in several states, some strong to violent. Several powerful supercell thunderstorms developed in central Kansas that afternoon, and large tornadoes were reported. Near {{the town of}} Corning, a strong EF3 carved an unusual V-shaped path through rural areas west of town, and completely destroyed two homes. An even larger tornado, an EF3 wedge that was over a quarter mile wide, touched down just west of Bennington, and remained nearly stationary in a field for over an hour. This tornado resulted in relatively moderate damage, but killed over 100 head of livestock. The tornado was originally rated EF4 based on mobile radar readings, but ground surveys did not reveal damage indicative of EF4 wind speeds, and the tornado was downgraded to an EF3 as a result. Later that evening, large tornadoes were sighted in southern Michigan, prompting several tornado emergencies. A total of six tornadoes were confirmed to have touched down in areas near Flint, two of which reached EF2 intensity and caused significant damage. Numerous weak tornadoes were documented in other states.|$|E
500|$|A <b>slight</b> <b>risk</b> day {{typically}} will {{indicate that}} the threat exists for scattered severe weather, including scattered wind damage (produced by straight-line sustained winds and/or gusts of 60 to 70 mph), scattered severe hail (varying in size from [...] to [...] ) and/or isolated tornadoes (often of shorter duration and varying weak to moderate intensity, depending on the available wind shear and other sufficient atmospheric parameters). During the peak severe weather season, most days will have a <b>slight</b> <b>risk</b> somewhere in the United States.
