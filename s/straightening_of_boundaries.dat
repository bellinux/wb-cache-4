Defence for James Wilson Sued by John Miller 7th. August 1820. Manuscript and personal communications. We are told in 1820 that [...] "the march dyke was [...] "built some many years ago when such boundaries were quite a new thing and thought {{by some to be}} rather an incovenience". Ditchers were employed to build it and thorns and trees were purchased to plant on it. The word fence is used as well as dyke in regards of the construction method. Part of the march dyke is still clearly indicated by a large coppiced beech and we know that this coppicing or pollarding was done because such 'marker' trees will live considerably longer than trees which have been left untouched.James Wilson of High Chapelton and John Miller of Laigh Chapelton went to court over the matter of the march dyke built between their lands by the father of James.

If the strain rate is too large, the straightening cracks will appear.

Study design: Sixty buccal root canals with angles of curvature between 30 to 99 º were instrumented with Mtwo and Twisted File rotary instruments. A series of pre- and post-operative radiographs were superimposed to determine the <b>straightening</b> <b>of</b> root canal curvature and apical transportation. The loss of working length and working time were also calculated. Results: All data were analyzed {{by means of the}} Student´s t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test. No statistically significant differences in the <b>straightening</b> <b>of</b> root canal curvature, apical transportation, or the loss of working length were found between groups. There was a significant difference in working time between angles of curvature when using the Mtwo system. Conclusion: Both rotary systems showed minimal changes in the original root canal curvature...|$|R

This paper is focused on the <b>straightening</b> precision <b>of</b> the guide rail and springback prediction using finite element method. According to the experimental results, by using numerical simulation with finite element analysis (FEA), the relationships among the maximal loading stroke and straightening stroke with the cross-section shape will be gained, and also the result curves were discussed qualitatively. The appropriateness of the simulation procedures employed in this work is represented for similar condition that is a good agreement between the finite element method and experimental results...|$|R
