In this paper, we first introduce a new security model of certificate-based <b>signatures.</b> Our model is not only more elaborated {{when compared with the}} existing ones, but also defines several new types of adversaries in certificate-based <b>signatures.</b> We then investigate the relationship between certificate-based <b>signatures</b> and certificateless <b>signatures,</b> by proposing a generic construction of certificate-based <b>signatures</b> from certificateless <b>signatures.</b> Our generic construction is secure (in the random oracle model) under the security model defined in this paper, assuming the underlying certificateless <b>signatures</b> satisfying certain security notions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} automorphic <b>signatures,</b> which satisfy the following properties: the verification keys lie in the message space, messages and <b>signatures</b> consist of group elements only, and verification is done by evaluating a set of pairing-product equations. These <b>signatures</b> make a perfect counterpart to the powerful proof system by Groth and Sahai (Eurocrypt 2008). We provide practical instantiations of automorphic <b>signatures</b> under appropriate assumptions and an extension yielding blind <b>signatures.</b> We then use them in combination with Groth-Sahai proofs to efficiently instantiate several cryptographic primitives, such as group <b>signatures,</b> non-interactive anonymous credentials and anonymous proxy <b>signatures.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|The F-22 was {{designed}} to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions, infrared <b>signature</b> and acoustic <b>signature</b> as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the infrared <b>signature</b> include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} concurrent <b>signatures.</b> These allow two entities to produce two <b>signatures</b> {{in such a way}} that, {{from the point of view}} of any third party, both <b>signatures</b> are ambiguous with respect to the identity of the signing party until an extra piece of information (the keystone) is released by one of the parties. Upon release of the keystone, both <b>signatures</b> become binding to their true signers concurrently. Concurrent <b>signatures</b> fall just short of providing a full solution to the problem of fair exchange of <b>signatures,</b> but we discuss some applications in which concurrent <b>signatures</b> suffice. Concurrent <b>signatures</b> are highly efficient and require neither a trusted arbitrator nor a high degree of interaction between parties. We provide a model of security for concurrent <b>signatures,</b> and a concrete scheme which we prove secure in the random oracle model under the discrete logarithm assumption...|$|R
40|$|Protocols for {{problems}} like Byzantine agreement, clock synchronization or contract signing often use digital <b>signatures</b> {{as the only}} cryptographic operation.

40|$|A pattern mining {{approach}} toward discovering generalized sequence <b>signatures</b> Typically, sequence <b>signatures,</b> such as motifs and domains, {{are assumed to}} be localized in one region of a sequence or are derived as combinations of the former. We generalize the concept of sequence <b>signatures</b> and introduce an algorithm for efficiently determining <b>signatures</b> based on subsequences that may be located anywhere on a sequence. In a preprocessing step, sequences are transformed into a feature space that is subsequently used to mine generalized <b>signatures.</b> We evaluate our <b>signatures</b> in relation to those in the Inter-Pro database and highlight the differences between them. A second comparison with InterPro shows that our <b>signatures</b> can be used to derive sequence annotations with a higher confidence. ...|$|R
