50|$|The Macquarie Point {{facility}} {{is out of}} date in terms of handling the size of modern freight trains, and lacks any space for a major redevelopment. It {{is located in the}} immediate area of a residential and tourist precinct, and is close to the Hobart CBD. It features many <b>short</b> <b>holding</b> tracks that prevent trains being moved as a single continuous vehicle which causes extensive Shunting throughout loading operations. These delays occur in addition to long travel times south of Bridgewater, where the main north/south railway line follows the River Derwent through Hobart's northern suburbs, across 21 level crossings which require slow train speeds to minimize the risk of accidents. The Macquarie Point site features a poor quality surface with uneven levels which creates difficulties for the loading, unloading and manoeuvring of freight across the site. The site configuration does not allow for efficient truck consolidation and deconsolidation and adds to the delays borne by transport companies waiting for containers to be unloaded.Management and security is also difficult because of numerous entry points and the poor rail layout.|$|E
50|$|An {{outgoing}} marker, being {{a complex}} control instrument with a <b>short</b> <b>holding</b> time, had the additional task of decoding {{the first three}} digits of the seven-digit telephone number to determine the routing to a distant exchange. A cross connect field had a terminal for each office code, which was cross connected to the coil of a route relay. When the office code point was grounded, it operated the route relay, whose contacts were wired in another cross connect or data field. Thus, the outgoing marker could select two office frames to search for idle trunks to the destination, and had pulsing information for the sender. The sender sent the telephone number to the distant terminating office. When one office was constructed, retired, or changed, staff in other offices received a Routing Letter, ordering the cross connect fields to be changed at a particular date and time, usually after midnight, to accommodate {{the change in the}} network.

40|$|Application of mild (non) -thermal {{processing}} {{technologies have}} received considerable interest as alternative to thermal pasteurisation, {{because of its}} shorter holding time and lower temperature aiming for an improved product quality. To understand and develop these alternative technologies, like pulsed electric fields, a proper comparison between the conventional thermal and alternative process is necessary. Up to recent, no suitable models were available to predict the inactivation of micro-organisms by a thermal process at a chosen <b>short</b> <b>holding</b> time, due to non-linearity. The recently developed Gauss-Eyring model with two variables temperature and time has the properties to be a suitable model to apply for <b>short</b> <b>holding</b> times, and was tested for this purpose. Therefore, this study aims to validate if the Gauss-Eyring model {{can be used to}} describe non-linear isothermal (a fixed temperature with varying holding time) and isotime (a fixed holding time with varying temperature) thermal inactivation data, and if it is a suitable model to predict the thermal inactivation as a function of temperature for <b>short</b> <b>holding</b> times. Inactivation data of Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus plantarum, Salmonella Senftenberg and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in orange juice were collected via isothermal and isotime inactivation kinetics. Survival of the tested micro-organisms was modelled with the Gauss-Eyring model, which contains three parameters σ Tr and Z. The transition of ‘no inactivation’ to ‘inactivation’ (i. e. the ‘shoulder’ in inactivation curves) can be characterised as the temperature-time (T,t) combination where T = Tr − Z · log 10 (t), with Tr as the reference temperature defined for 1 s treatment, Z as the temperature needed for a 10 -fold increase of decrease of the holding time t, and σ as the temperature width of the distribution. The Gauss-Eyring model fitted well to the experimental data, and revealed different sensitivity for the tested micro-organisms. Based on the parameter estimations, survival curves for the desired <b>short</b> <b>holding</b> times were predicted. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{traditional}} investment strategies (value and growth) are compared to modern investment strategies (momentum, contrarian and GARP) {{in terms of}} risk, performance and cumulative returns. Strategies are compared during time period reaching from 1996 to 2010 in the Finnish stock market. Used data includes all listed main list stocks, dividends and is adjusted in case of splits, and mergers and acquisitions. Strategies are tested using different holding periods (6, 12 and 36 months) and data is divided into tercile portfolios based on different ranking criteria. Contrarian and growth strategies are the only strategies with improved cumulative returns when longer holding periods are used. Momentum (52 -week high price 1) and GARP strategies based on <b>short</b> <b>holding</b> period have the best performance and contrarian and growth strategies the worst.

40|$|In {{this study}} five {{different}} variants of an AA 6082 aluminum alloy were investigated. The alloys have various amounts of Mn (0. 006 - 1. 172 wt%) and are homogenized {{in two different}} ways. After homogenization the billets got extrudet into rectangular-hollow profiles that were cooled using two different cooling rates (air-cooling and water-quenching). Further, the profiles were artificially aged to three different tempers (under-aged, peak-aged and over-aged). The effect of these parameters on microstructure, mechanical properties and crush performance of the various alloys in different states have systematically been studied. The materials microstructure were investigated by optical microscope and transmission electron microscope, mechanical testing {{was used to determine}} the stress-strain curves in uniaxial tension, and impact-testing and crush-testing was performed to investigate the energy absorption of the materials. Results from this study show that chemical composition, homogenization procedure, cooling rate after extrusion and artificial ageing influence the grain structure, mechanical properties and crush behavior of these AA 6082 -alloys to a large extent. Increased content of Mn and <b>short</b> <b>holding</b> time during homogenization increases the density of dispersoids.
