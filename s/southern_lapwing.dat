50|$|Viator picis is an extinct genus {{and species}} of lapwing (Charadriiformes; Charadriidae; Vanellinae) known only from the upper Pleistocene asphalt {{deposits}} known as the Talara Tar Seeps, which are found near Talara, northwestern Peru. It was described by Campbell (1979). Although {{it appears to be}} related to the <b>southern</b> <b>lapwing</b> (Belonopterus chilensis) and the Andean lapwing (Belonopterus resplendens), it is quite distinct from Vanellus sensu stricto; however, most authorities now include the former two species in an expanded Vanellus which includes all lapwings, in which case Viator picis may belong in Vanellus as well.|$|E
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>lapwing</b> (Vanellus chilensis) is a wader in {{the order}} Charadriiformes. It is a common and {{widespread}} resident throughout South America, except in densely forested regions (e.g. most of the Amazon), the higher parts of the Andes and the arid coast of {{a large part of}} western South America. This bird is particularly common in the basin of the Rio de la Plata. It has also been spreading through Central America in recent years. It reached Trinidad in 1961 and Tobago in 1974, and has rapidly increased on both islands, sporadically making its way North to Barbados where one pair mated, nested and produced chicks in 2007.|$|E
50|$|This is a lapwing of {{lake and}} river banks or open grassland. It {{has benefited from}} the {{extension}} of the latter habitat through widespread cattle ranching. When nesting in the vicinity of airports, it poses a threat to the safety of aerial traffic. Its food is mainly insects and other small invertebrates, hunted using a run-and-wait technique mainly at night, often in flocks. In urban areas like Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo it can even be seen feeding on floodlit soccer pitches during televised matches. The <b>southern</b> <b>lapwing</b> breeds on grassland and sometimes ploughed fields, and has an aerobatic flapping display flight. It lays 2-3 (rarely 4) olive-brown eggs in a bare ground scrape. The nest and young are defended noisily and aggressively against all intruders (including humans) by means of threats, vocalizations and low flights. After the breeding season it disperses into wetlands and seasonally-flooded tropical grassland.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Behavioural {{patterns}} of birds commonly {{vary according to}} flock size and daily activity pattern. <b>Southern</b> <b>lapwing</b> behaviours and their relation with flock size were studied, {{as well as the}} relationship between the frequency of behaviours and the period of the day. Results showed that the proportion of time spent in foraging and vigilance was higher during the morning, when small groups were more common, and decreased from midday on, when group size increased. Maintenance and inactivity (sleeping) behaviours presented the opposite pattern. Correlation between flock size and period of the day, and their similar effects on bird behaviour may be evidence that groups of different sizes could have different functions throughout the day. Our results show that southern lapwings seem to form smaller flocks for feeding {{in the beginning of the}} day and larger flocks later for different activities (e. g., main-tenance and sleeping). In this sense, it is possible that group size variation throughout the day is related to different demands for specific behaviours (functions) of groups, according to the daily activity {{patterns of}} the birds...|$|E
40|$|Computer-assisted species {{recognition}} {{facilitates the}} analysis of relevant biological information in continuous audio recordings. In the present study, we assess the suitability of this approach for determining distinct life-cycle phases of the <b>Southern</b> <b>Lapwing</b> Vanellus chilensis lampronotus based on adult vocal activity. For this purpose we use passive 14 -min and 30 -min soundscape recordings (n = 33 201) collected in 24 / 7 mode between November 2012 and October 2013 in Brazil's Pantanal wetlands. Time-stamped detections of V. chilensis call events (n = 62 292) were obtained with a species-specific sound recognizer. We demonstrate that the breeding season fell in a three-month period from mid-May to early August 2013, {{between the end of}} the flood cycle and the height of the dry season. Several phases of the lapwing's life history were identified with presumed error margins of a few days: pre-breeding, territory establishment and egg-laying, incubation, hatching, parental defense of chicks, and post-breeding. Diurnal time budgets confirm high acoustic activity levels during midday hours in June and July, indicative of adults defending young. By August, activity patterns had reverted to nonbreeding mode, with peaks around dawn and dusk and low call frequency during midday heat. We assess the current technological limitations of the V. chilensis recognizer through a comprehensive performance assessment and scrutinize the usefulness of automated acoustic recognizers in studies on the distribution pattern, ecology, life history, and conservation status of sound-producing animal species...|$|E
40|$|Our study {{compares the}} visual {{function}} of the Double-striped Thick-knee (Burhinus bistriatus Wagler, 1829), which forages primarily during dusk and at night, and the <b>Southern</b> <b>Lapwing</b> (Vanellus chilensis L., 1758), which is known to forage during daytime and occasionally at night, analyzing morphological and electrophysiological aspects of their retina. The fact that thick-knees have large eyes and are nocturnally actives suggest that, compared with the diurnal lapwing, {{they should have a}} very sensitive retina under low light intensity. Electroretinograms (ERGs) were obtained from anesthetized live birds at different light intensities in photopic and scotopic conditions, and the retinae were subsequently processed for histological analysis. The scotopic ERG b-waves of B. bistriatus, at all light intensities, were always of larger amplitude than those of V. chilensis. However, the a-waves of both species were of similar amplitude. Under photopic conditions, V. chilensis yield highest a- and b-wave amplitudes than B. bistriatus. The latter has a larger dialated pupil diameter and a greater axial length/equatorial diameter ratio than V. chilensis. Likewise, the rod density of B. bistriatus significantly exceeds that of V. chilensis. In the latter, cone density tends to be higher than in B. bistriatus while the rods:cones ratio were lower. Rod outer segments of B. bistriatus strongly exceed in length those of any other Charadriiformes species studied so far, but are thinner than those of V. chilensis. In contrast, the latter has thicker cone outer segments and outer and inner plexiform layers than B. bistriatus. Similarly, ganglion cells are more abundant per unit area in V. chilensis. Our combined results reveal a higher retinal sensitivity of B. bistriatus under low light conditions, in accordance with their crepuscular and nocturnal foraging strategies. V. chilensis, although mainly active during daylight, appears to have a moderate retinal sensitivity under low light conditions. Thus, we conclude that Southern Lapwings present visual adaptations that enable them to function in nocturnal as well as in diurnal conditions...|$|E
40|$|Glia {{have been}} implicated {{in a variety of}} {{functions}} in the central nervous system, including the control of the neuronal extracellular space, synaptic plasticity and transmission, development and adult neurogenesis. Perineuronal glia forming groups around neurons are associated with both normal and pathological nervous tissue. Recent studies have linked {{reduction in the number of}} perineuronal oligodendrocytes in the prefrontal cortex with human schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. Therefore, perineuronal glia may play a decisive role in homeostasis and normal activity of the human nervous system. Here we report on the discovery of novel cell clusters in the telencephala of five healthy Passeriforme, one Psittaciform and one Charadriiforme bird species, which we refer to as Perineuronal Glial Clusters (PGCs). The aim of this study is to describe the structure and distribution of the PGCs in a number of avian species. PGCs were identified with the use of standard histological procedures. Heterochromatin masses visible inside the nuclei of these satellite glia suggest that they may correspond to oligodendrocytes. PGCs were found in the brains of nine New Caledonian crows, two Japanese jungle crows, two Australian magpies, two Indian mynah, three zebra finches (all Passeriformes), one <b>Southern</b> <b>lapwing</b> (Charadriiformes) and one monk parakeet (Psittaciformes). Microscopic survey of the brain tissue suggests that the largest PGCs are located in the hyperpallium densocellulare and mesopallium. No clusters were found in brain sections from one Gruiform (purple swamphen), one Strigiform (barn owl), one Trochiliform (green-backed firecrown), one Falconiform (chimango caracara), one Columbiform (pigeon) and one Galliform (chick). Our observations suggest that PGCs in Aves are brain region- and taxon-specific and that the presence of perineuronal glia in healthy human brains and the similar PGCs in avian gray matter is the result of convergent evolution. The discovery of PGCs in the zebra finch is of great importance because this species has the potential to become a robust animal model in which to study the function of neuron-glia interactions in healthy and diseased adult brains...|$|E
