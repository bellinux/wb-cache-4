The interior of the Chapel, however, was not yet completed. A further payment was made to John Wyld, the joiner, of £50 in 1664, also £30 to Simon White, the carver, for marbles, in 1665.

25|$|Historically in Lutheranism {{there have}} been two parties {{regarding}} Eucharistic adoration: Gnesio-Lutherans, who followed Martin Luther's view in favor of adoration, and Philippists who followed Philipp Melanchthon's view against it. Although Luther did not entirely approve of the Feast of Corpus Christi, he wrote a treatise The Adoration of the Sacrament (1523) where he defended adoration but desired that the issue not be forced. In his reform of the Roman Mass Luther placed the Sanctus after the Institution Narrative to serve as a <b>solemn</b> <b>act</b> of worship of the Real Presence just brought about by the latter. After the death of Martin Luther, further controversies developed including Crypto-Calvinism and the second Sacramentarian controversy, started by Gnesio-Lutheran Joachim Westphal. The Philippist understanding of the Real Presence without overt adoration through time became dominant in Lutheranism, although it is not in accordance with Luther's teaching. The German theologian Andreas Musculus can be {{regarded as one of the}} warmest defenders of Eucharistic adoration in early Lutheranism.|$|E

In June 1938, {{based on the}} request of her spiritual director, Father Mariano Pinho, several bishops from Portugal wrote to Pope Pius XI, asking him to consecrate {{the world to the}} Immaculate Heart of Mary. In June 1938, Father Mariano Pinho, conducted a retreat at Fátima, Portugal, for the Portuguese bishops, {{at the end of which}} the bishops forwarded their own request to Pius XI for the consecration of the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. This request was renewed several times. At that time Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) was the secretary of the state of the Vatican. On October 31, 1942, Pius XII made a <b>solemn</b> <b>Act</b> of Consecration of the Church and the whole world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, joined by the bishops of Portugal, gathered at the Cathedral in Lisbon. Pius spoke by radio, in Portuguese, to an audience of thousands of pilgrims who had come to Fátima to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the last apparition of Our Lady.|$|E

2500|$|Miller now {{considered}} the third question. The majority held {{that although the}} language of the two statutes of January 31, 1863, and February 4, 1863, were different, they had the same legal intent and force. Virginia showed [...] "good faith" [...] in holding the elections, Miller asserted. That the Reorganized Virginia legislature did not require vote totals to be reported to it and delegated the transmission of the vote totals to West Virginia was not at issue, Miller said. [...] It gave the Reorganized Governor discretion as to when and where to hold the votes, under what condition the votes should be held, and to certify the votes. The legislature acted within its power to delegate these duties to the Reorganized Governor, [...] "and his decision [...] conclusive as to the result." [...] Were these votes fair and regular? The Virginia Assembly, Miller noted, made only [...] "indefinite and vague" [...] allegations about vote fraud, and unspecified charges that somehow Governor Pierpont must have been [...] "misled and deceived" [...] by others into believing the voting was fair and regular. Miller pointedly observed that not a single person was charged with fraud, no specific act of fraud was stated, and no legal wrongs asserted. The Virginia Assembly also did not claim that the state of West Virginia interfered in the elections. Absent such allegations, Virginia's accusations cannot be sustained, Miller concluded. [...] But even if this aspect of Virginia's argument was ignored, Miller wrote, the Reorganized legislature had delegated all its power to certify to the election to Governor Pierpont, and he had certified it. That alone laid to rest Virginia's allegations. [...] " [...] must be bound by what she had done. She can have no right, years after all this has been settled, to come into a court of chancery to charge that her own conduct has been a wrong and a fraud; that her own subordinate agents have misled her governor, and that her <b>solemn</b> <b>act</b> transferring these counties shall be set aside, against the will of the State of West Virginia, and without consulting the wishes of the people of those counties." ...|$|E

Catharine did not, however, live long to exercise her beneficial power.

60|$|Where {{the teacher}} has not {{sufficient}} confidence that the general sense of propriety among his pupils will preserve good order and decorum during the exercise, it may be better for him to read a prayer, selected from books of devotion, or prepared by himself expressly for the occasion. By this plan his school will be, during the exercise, under his own observation as at other times. It may, in some schools, where the number is small, or the prevailing habits of seriousness and order are good, be well to allow the older scholars to read the prayer in rotation, taking especial care {{that it does not}} degenerate into a mere reading exercise; but that it is understood, both by readers and hearers, to be a <b>solemn</b> <b>act</b> of religious worship. In a word, if the teacher is really honest and sincere in his wish to lead his pupils to the worship of God, he will find no serious difficulty in preventing the abuses and avoiding the dangers which some might fear, and in accomplishing vast good, both in promoting the prosperity of the school, and {{in the formation of the}} highest and best traits a individual character.|$|E
60|$|It {{has always}} been the custom, in modern times, to require the <b>solemn</b> <b>act</b> of the supreme {{magistrate}} of any state to confirm a decision of a tribunal which condemns a person to death, by signing what is called a warrant for the execution. This is done by the king or queen in England, and by the governor in one of the United States. This warrant is an order, very formally written, and sealed with the great seal, authorizing the executioner to proceed, and carry the sentence into effect. Of course, Queen Mary could not be executed unless Elizabeth should first sign the warrant. Elizabeth would herself, probably, have been better pleased to have been excused from all direct agency in the affair. But this could not be. She, however, made much delay, and affected great unwillingness to proceed. She sent messengers to Mary, telling her what the sentence had been, how sorry she was to hear it, and how much she desired to save her life, if it were possible. At the same time, she told her that she feared it might not be in her power, and she advised Mary to prepare her mind for the execution of the sentence.|$|E

Naturally: for when [...] "poor Peter" [...] had occupied his arm-chair in the wainscoted parlor, no assiduous beetles for whom the cook prepares boiling water could have been less welcome on a hearth which they had reasons for preferring, than those persons whose Featherstone blood was ill-nourished, not from penuriousness on their part, but from poverty. Brother Solomon and Sister Jane were rich, and the family candor and total abstinence from false politeness with which they were always received seemed to them no argument that their brother in the <b>solemn</b> <b>act</b> of making his will would overlook the superior claims of wealth. Themselves at least he had never been unnatural enough to banish from his house, and it seemed hardly eccentric that he should have kept away Brother Jonah, Sister Martha, and the rest, who had no shadow of such claims.
