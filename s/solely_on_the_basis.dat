To test this hypothesis, we recorded eye movements from high-functioning autistic adolescents and from age-matched controls during a blanking paradigm. In this paradigm, adolescents were instructed to follow a moving target with their eyes even during its transient disappearance. Given the absence of visual information during the blanking period, eye movements during this period are <b>solely</b> controlled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>the</b> prediction of the ongoing target motion. Typical markers of predictive eye movements such as the number and accuracy of predictive saccades and the predictive reacceleration before target reappearance were identical in the two populations. In addition, the synergy of predictive saccades and smooth pursuit observed during the blanking periods, which is a marker {{for the quality of}} internal models about target/eye motions, was comparable between these two populations.

40|$|Generation {{of dynamic}} contact angle {{in the course}} of wetting is a {{fundamental}} phenomenon of nature. Dynamic wetting processes have a direct impact on flows at nano-scale, and therefore their understanding is exceptionally important to emerging technologies. Here, we reveal the microscopic mechanism of dynamic contact angle generation. It has been demonstrated using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of bead-spring model fluids that the main cause of local contact angle variations is the distribution of microscopic force acting at the contact line region. We were able to retrieve this elusive force with high accuracy. It has been directly established that the force distribution can be <b>solely</b> predicted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of a general friction law for liquid flow at solid surfaces by Thompson and Troian.

40|$|Purpose The {{interpretation}} of <b>the</b> available studies <b>on</b> adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in children outside {{the hospital is}} hampered because none of these studies used a control group. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe ADRs in children outside the hospital, controlled for drug use in the paediatric background population. Methods Using a case-control design, we compared drugs on which a suspected ADR was reported to the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre LAREB, and drugs used in the general paediatric population from the InterAction pharmacy database, both in the year 200 1, for children aged 0 - 16 years. Results The main findings are that ADRs were disproportionately more often reported on systemic drugs (OR 3. 0; [95 %CI: 1. 9 - 4. 8]), new drugs (2. 4; [1. 6 - 2. 7]), anti-infective drugs (1. 7; [1. 1 - 2. 7]) and nervous system drugs (2. 1; [1. 3 - 3. 5]), whereas unlicensed drugs (0. 1; [0. 0 - 0. 4]), frequently used drugs (0. 3; [0. 2 - 0. 5]) and dermatologicals (0. 1; [0. 0 - 0. 4]) were less likely to be associated with a reported ADR. Overall, the proportion of off-label prescriptions did not differ between drugs suspected of an ADR and drugs used by children in a general population. Conclusions The pattern of drugs associated with a reported ADR could not be <b>solely</b> explained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of drug utilisation patterns in the general population.

40|$|The {{degeneration}} of postovulatory follicles (POFs) in {{time and}} at different temperatures was studied for the Bay of Biscay anchovy. For this purpose a key of 7 POF stages, <b>solely</b> defined <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of their histological degeneration characteristics, was applied. The novelty of this procedure is that it separates staging of POFs from their ageing process. The female gonads, taken from several captivity experiments and field samples, were classified in this way. Water temperature in captivity tanks corresponded to high values (17 - 21 °C), except for one case in which different day and night temperatures were applied. In addition, 472 field samples (11948 anchovy females) from several cruises were examined; of these, 126 samples (3348 females) were identified as coming from areas of high sea surface temperature (weighted mean = 17. 76 °C, s. d. = 0. 84) and 131 samples (3181 females) as coming from areas of low sea surface temperature (weighted mean = 14. 42 °C, s. d. = 0. 75). There was close agreement in the succession of POF stages over time after spawning between the experiment and the field samples. The first four stages of POF degeneration occurred in less than 24 h, {{and by the end}} of the first day the POFs were mainly in Stage V. Stages VI and VII showed their highest occurrence during the first and second half of the second day after spawning, respectively. Full resorption of POFs was achieved in about 55 - 60 h.

40|$|Ant-dipping is a tool-use {{behavior}} {{targeted at}} biting and gregarious army ants (Dorylus spp.). Although several wild chimpanzee communities exhibit this behavior, some do not, although army ants are ubiquitous across Africa. This tool-use behavior {{is often cited}} {{as one of the}} best examples of culture in chimpanzees. Nevertheless, recent data emerging from Bossou in southeastern Guinea and detailed entomological analysis of the army ant species available at different chimpanzee study sites, as well as direct observations of this behavior, indicate that the aggressiveness and the density of the ant species influence tool length and the technique employed to consume the ants off the tool. Behavioral differences persist, however, between the communities of Taï, Côte d’Ivoire, and Bossou, where the same species of army ants are consumed by the chimpanzees. A comparative study indicates that these variations in ant-dipping between these two long-term field sites cannot <b>solely</b> be explained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of prey behavior, characteristics, and availability and must therefore be cultural. A longitudinal study of the acquisition of ant-dipping among the chimpanzees of Bossou supports this assertion by revealing the importance of social influences and the role of the mother in the learning process of young chimpanzees.

40|$|Vitamin E is {{a generic}} term {{frequently}} used to group together eight different molecules, namely: α-, β-, γ- and δ-tocopherol {{and the corresponding}} tocotrienols. The term tocopherol and eventually Vitamin E and its related activity was originally based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> capacity of countering foetal re-absorption in deficient rodents or the development of encephalomalacia in chickens. In humans, Vitamin E activity is {{generally considered to be}} solely related to the antioxidant properties of the tocolic chemical structure. In recent years, several reports have shown that specific activities exist for each different tocotrienol form. In this short review, tocotrienol ability to inhibit cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis thanks to specific mechanisms, not shared by tocopherols, such as the binding to Estrogen Receptor-β (ERβ) and the triggering of endoplasmic reticulum (EndoR) stress will be described. The neuroprotective activity will also be presented and discussed. We propose that available studies strongly indicate that specific forms of tocotrienols have a distinct mechanism and biological activity, significantly different from tocopherol and more specifically from α-tocopherol.
