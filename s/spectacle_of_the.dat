5|$|The Stonyhurst Officer Training Corps {{assembled}} for {{the first}} time on 16 October 1900, in the Ambulacrum, overseen by The First Volunteer Battalion, the East Lancashire Regiment who gave instruction in drill and musketry. The original uniform was scarlet with a white piping and slouch hat, which was changed to khaki before the First World War. The Corps was granted the honour of representation at the Coronation of 1910 and sent members to the Royal Review at Windsor in 1911. It also appeared on parade annually for the <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Corpus Christi celebrations until the practice became obsolete after Vatican II.|$|E

40|$|In a cross-cultural, cross-temporal comparison, Ana Mitrovici juxtaposes {{the ritual}} games and <b>spectacles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romans and the Aztecs. <b>The</b> display <b>of</b> conquered peoples by {{imperial}} powers is commonly examined in <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> post-colonial theories about power struggles and identity. In addition, with a spectacle like those examined here, <b>the</b> deliberate injection <b>of</b> peripheral images into <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> power shows <b>the</b> centers construction <b>of</b> power and self-identity very clearly. Using her comparison to show <b>the</b> functions <b>of</b> <b>spectacle</b> in imperial identity formation, Mitrovici highlights some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uses <b>of</b> violence and display within a borderlands complex...|$|R
5|$|Finally {{reaching}} the Emerald City (an analogue of the real-life World Trade Center plaza), the quintet gains passage {{into the city}} because of Dorothy's ownership of the silver slippers; they marvel at the <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city and its sophisticated, fashion forward dancers. They are granted an audience with the Wiz (Richard Pryor), who lives {{at the very top}} of the Towers. He appears to them as a giant fire-breathing metallic head. He will only grant their wishes if they kill the sister of the Wicked Witch of the East, Evillene (Mabel King), the Wicked Witch of the West, who runs a sweatshop in the underground sewers of Oz. Before they can reach her domain, Evillene learns of their quest to kill her and sends out the Flying Monkeys (a motorcycle gang) to kidnap them.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} on Criterion's proprietary game engine RenderWare. The graphics engine was improved to give between 50–100% faster rendering than in Burnout 2. The increased performance {{allowed them to}} add features like real-time radiosity lighting and better environment mapping effects on vehicles. Programmers at the studio were adamant about making the game run at a frame rate of sixty frames per seconds to offer instant response and feedback while driving fast. Since the crash sequences were slower, the higher frame rate was less considered less critical than the <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle collisions. They opted to run the game at thirty frames per second during these instances and dramatically {{increased the number of}} particles and debris that were rendered. From an early stage in development, the team wanted to include support for online network play in Burnout 3. They had never explored online play before, so they used Burnout 2 as a test-bed for the feature before integrating it into Burnout 3.|$|E
25|$|A {{particularly}} distinctive form of {{road locomotive}} was the showman's engine. These were operated by travelling showmen both to tow fairground equipment and to power it when set up, {{either directly or}} by running a generator.

25|$|During the First World War, Duff Gordon's focus {{shifted to}} her New York office {{which she had}} opened in 1910. For her New York fashion shows she {{imported}} her own models from England, although Dolores was not among the first she brought over. The shows became so popular {{that she had to}} start holding them in a theatre. It was probably at one such event around 1916 that Florenz Ziegfeld and his wife Billie Burke discovered Duff Gordon's designs and her model Dolores. Ziegfeld was enraptured by Dolores and the luxurious <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show and Burke ordered two of Duff Gordon's creations. Soon, Duff Gordon was making costumes for Ziegfeld's theatrical productions, the Ziegfeld Follies.|$|E
25|$|Then {{the trio}} of Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who, and Mrs Which arrive. They charge Meg with rescuing Charles Wallace from IT, because only Meg has a strong enough bond with him. Their father had last seen Charles Wallace {{when he was a}} baby and Calvin had only just met him. They each give her a gift. Mrs Whatsit gives Meg her love. Mrs Who quotes to Meg a passage from the Bible about God {{choosing}} the foolish of the world to confound the wise, and the weak to defeat the strong (1st Corinthians 1:27-29). Mrs Which tells Meg that she has one thing that IT does not have. Upon arriving at the building where IT is housed, Charles Wallace is still there under IT's influence. Meg realizes that the one thing she has that IT does not is love. She focuses all her love at Charles Wallace and is able to free him from IT's control. Mrs Who, Mrs Which and Mrs Whatsit tesser the Murrys and Calvin back to Earth. In the vegetable garden they are reunited with Mrs. Murry and the twins. Mrs Whatsit says that, although she and the others like the <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family reuniting, they have to go somewhere. Before Mrs Whatsit finishes her sentence, she and the others disappear.|$|E
50|$|However, Wordsworth's hatred <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{panorama}} was {{not limited}} to its deceit. The panorama's association with the sublime was likewise offensive to the poet as were other <b>spectacles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period that competed with reality. As a poet, Wordsworth sought to separate his craft from the phantasmagoria enveloping the population. In this context, phantasmagoria refers to signs and other circulated propaganda, including billboards, illustrated newspapers and panoramas themselves. Wordsworth's biggest problem with panoramas was their pretense: the panorama lulled spectators into stupors, inhibiting their ability to imagine things for themselves. Wordsworth wanted people to see the representation depicted in the panorama and appreciate it for what it was - art.|$|R

500|$|This was {{the second}} time in a {{fortnight}} that Arsenal and Liverpool had played each other; at the end of July, the two teams competed in the Makita International Tournament at Wembley. Arsenal won the game by a single goal to win the tournament and then on their pre-season travels beat Argentinian champions Independiente. The <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Charity Shield was lost on certain football journalists previewing the match, because of Liverpool's recent successes in the Shield as well as the prospect of Arsenal beating Liverpool for a third time in succession. David Lacey wrote in The Guardian of 12 August 1989: [...] "The FA Charity Shield is now more of a pre-season finale than a pipe opener for the main event," [...] and Stuart Jones of The Times went further in his assessment of its decline: ...|$|E
40|$|One of Turkey’s {{best known}} singers, Bülent Ersoy’s M 2 F {{transition}} {{coincided with the}} 1980 military coup.

500|$|The K Foundation's final {{solution}} for their one-million-pound [...] "problem" [...] was rather less showbiz, but dramatic nonetheless, the Foundation having decided that making a public <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event would lessen its impact. On 22 August, Reid, Drummond, Cauty and Gimpo touched down at Islay Airport in the Inner Hebrides {{and took a}} ferry to the island of Jura, previously {{the scene of a}} wicker man burning ceremony by The KLF. Early in the morning of 23 August 1994, in an abandoned boathouse on Jura, Drummond and Cauty incinerated the money. The burning was witnessed by Reid, who subsequently wrote an article about the act for The Observer, and it was filmed on a Hi-8 video camera by collaborator Gimpo. As the burning began Reid said he felt guilt and shock. These feelings, he reported, quickly turned to boredom.|$|E

David Prescott Barrows, who {{describes}} Marrakesh as Morocco's [...] "strangest city", describes the landscape in the following terms: [...] "The city lies some fifteen or twenty miles [...] from {{the foot of the}} Atlas mountains, which here rise to their grandest proportions. The <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountains is superb. Through the clear desert air the eye can follow the rugged contours of the range for great distances to the north and eastward.

500|$|The {{second half}} of the opening {{ceremony}} and the start of the competitive program was a basketball match between Australia and England.

In front of a couple of thousand spectators, with the game being called on the public address system by a television sports commentator, Allan Terry, the Australians beat the English by a single basket (20-18). The atmosphere was summarised in The Australian Paraplegic: [...] "The <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opening ceremony and wheelpast, followed by the excitement of the basketball, sent spectators home well rewarded for their attendance at the opening day of the First Commonwealth Paraplegic Games."

500|$|The plot is padded with a {{large amount}} of filler. [...] Films of this type were usually {{produced}} quickly and at minimal cost, and while filler was sometimes used to increase the production value, the usual motivation was to extend its running time to qualify for feature length status. [...] Eric Schaefer notes that the [...] "primary purpose" [...] of the plot of Mom and Dad [...] was to [...] "serve as the vehicle onto which the <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clinical reels can be grafted", such as the live birth scene. [...] The marketing materials suggest the latter reason also, and many posters for the film promised that [...] "You [...] actually SEE the birth of a baby!" [...] The dialogue is carefully worded, and uses period euphemisms rather than explicit terms that may have been controversial at the time. [...] In particular, at no time does the film specifically mention sexual intercourse or pregnancy.|$|E
500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Betsey Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times panned the [...] "overwhelmingly complicated, globe-hopping, enemies within, enemies without story line" [...] and 3D but noted that [...] "the humor, when it works, offers 'Retaliation' some redemption." [...] She ended with: [...] "It's convoluted. Frankly {{no one should}} {{have to think that}} hard {{to keep up with the}} Joes." [...] Another negative review came from Variety Magazines Justin Chang, who ridiculed the movie's large-scale destruction of foreign cities, writing: [...] "Audiences who thrilled to the sight of Paris under biochemical attack in Cobra will be pleased to watch London endure an even more horrific fate here, although the sequence is tossed off in quick, almost ho-hum fashion, with no time to dwell on anything so exquisitely crass as the <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eiffel Tower collapsing."

500|$|In the 1420s and 1430s, {{when oil}} and panel {{painting}} {{were still in}} their infancy, vertical formats were often used for depictions of the Last Judgement, because the narrow framing particularly suited a hierarchical presentation of heaven, earth and hell. By contrast, depictions of the Crucifixion were usually presented in a horizontal format. To fit such expansive and highly detailed representations onto two equally small and narrow wings, van Eyck was forced to make a number of innovations, redesigning many elements of the Crucifixion panel to match the vertical and condensed presentation of the Judgement narrative. The result is a panel with the crosses rising high into the sky, an unusually packed crowd scene in the mid-ground, and the moving <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mourners in the foreground, all rendered in a continuous slope from bottom to top {{in the style of}} medieval tapestries. Art historian Otto Pächt says it [...] "is the whole world in one painting, an Orbis Pictus".|$|E
