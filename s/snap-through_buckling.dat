40|$|Recent {{proposed}} rafter slenderness limits, {{to prevent}} snap-through of plastically designed pitched-roof portal frames, incorporate the elastic <b>snap-through</b> <b>buckling</b> load of such frames. It {{has been suggested}} that the elastic <b>snap-through</b> <b>buckling</b> load used in the proposals is over-estimated making these slenderness limits unconservative. This is supported by a more rigorous elastic analysis. To test the proposals, model frames lying on or close to the slenderness limits were tested to failure in the laboratory. Frame dimensions were chosen so that the frames were only susceptible to snap-through instability. Failure loads far lower than the expected plastic collapse loads were measured, showing that the elastic <b>snap-through</b> <b>buckling</b> load is over -estimated. Since plastic analysis is easily applied to portal frames, these slenderness limits are best replaced by a similar limit incorporating a more accurate elastic <b>snap-through</b> <b>buckling</b> load.

40|$|Space trusses {{under certain}} {{conditions}} may be prone to <b>snap-through</b> <b>buckling.</b> The sudden reduction of the load carrying capacity of a single critical compression member, {{or a group of}} compression members, may lead to the <b>snap-through</b> <b>buckling</b> of the compression chord of the structure. This temporary loss of equilibrium due to snap-through normally results in a dynamic force being applied to each node associated with the snap-through. In this paper a methodology based on energy methods is presented to determine the dynamic snap-through response of truss structures. Member failure is taken into consideration by carefully following the buckling load-displacement response of the member. It is assumed that the structure is subjected only to static gravitational loading. A one degree of freedom, simple three bar truss, is used to describe the approach.

Several 60 -in-radius composite panels with four different laminate configurations were tested with cutout diameters that range from 10 % to 60 % of the panel width. Finite-element analyses were performed for each panel in order to identify the effects boundary conditions, measured initial geometric imperfections and thickness variations had on the nonlinear and buckling behavior of the panels. The compression-loaded panels considered herein exhibited two separate types of behavior depending on the laminate stacking sequence and cutout size.

40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this {{dissertation}} is the characterization of <b>snap-through</b> <b>buckling</b> of discrete and continuous systems. <b>Snap-through</b> <b>buckling</b> occurs as the consequence of two factors, first the destabilization, or more often the disappearance of, an equilibrium position under the change of a system parameter, and second the existence of another stable equilibrium configuration at a remote location in state space. In this sense <b>snap-through</b> <b>buckling</b> is a global dynamic transition {{as the result of}} a local static instability. In order to better understand the static instabilities that lead to <b>snap-through</b> <b>buckling,</b> the behavior of mechanical systems in the vicinity of various local bifurcations is first investigated. Oscillators with saddle-node, pitchfork, and transcritical bifurcations are shown analytically to exhibit several interesting characteristics, particularly in relation to the system damping ratio. A simple mechanical oscillator with a transcritical bifurcation is used to experimentally verify the analytical results. The transcritical bifurcation was selected since it may be used to represent generic bifurcation behavior. It is shown that the damping ratio may be used to predict changes in stability with respect to changing system parameters. Another useful indicator of snap-through is the presence of chaos in the dynamic response of a system. Chaos is usually associated snap-through, as in many systems large amplitude responses are typically necessary to sufficiently engage the nonlinearities that induce chaos. Thus, a pragmatic approach for identifying chaos in experimental (and hence noisy) systems is also developed. The method is applied to multiple experimental systems showing good agreement with identification via Lyapunov exponents. Under dynamic loading, systems with the requisite condition for <b>snap-through</b> <b>buckling,</b> that is co-existing equilibria, typically exhibit either small amplitude response about a single equilibrium configuration, or large amplitude response that transits between the static equilibria. Dynamic snap-through is the name given to the large amplitude response, which, in the context of structural systems, is obviously undesirable. This phenomenon is investigated using experimental, numerical, and analytical means and the boundaries separating safe (non-snap-through) from unsafe (snap-through) dynamic response in forcing parameter space are obtained for both a discrete and a continuous arch. Arches present an ideal avenue for the investigation of snap-through as they typically have multiple, often tunable, stable and unstable equilibria. They also have many direct applications in both civil engineering, where arches are a canonical structural element, and mechanical engineering, where arches may be used to approximate the behavior of curved plates and panels such as those used on aircraft.

40|$|We develop {{efficient}} and accurate numerical methods {{to solve a}} class of shallow shell problems of the von Karman type. The governing equations form a fourth-order coupled system of nonlinear biharnomic equations for the transverse deflection and Airy's stress function. A second-order finite difference discretization with three iterative methods (Picard, Newton and Trust-Region Dogleg) are proposed for the numerical solution of the nonlinear PDE system. Three simple boundary conditions and two application-motivated mixed boundary conditions are considered. Along with the nonlinearity of the system, boundary singularities that appear when mixed boundary conditions are specified are the main numerical challenges. Two approaches that use either a transition function or local corrections are developed {{to deal with these}} boundary singularities. All the proposed numerical methods are validated using carefully designed numerical tests, where expected orders of accuracy and rates of convergence are observed. A rough run-time performance comparison is also conducted to illustrate the efficiency of our methods. As an application of the methods, a <b>snap-through</b> thermal <b>buckling</b> problem is considered.

The procedure is applied in conjunction with the modified Newton-Rapbson method in both its original and accelerated forms. The resulting techniques not only allow limit points to be passed. but also, improve the convergence characteristics of the unconstrained iterative procedures.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} paper is to study the {{parametric}} instability and <b>snap-through</b> <b>buckling</b> of an axially pre-loaded, partially fluid-filled cylindrical shell. The Donnell non-linear shallow shell theory is used to study the nonlinear vibrations of the shell. For this, the Galerkin method is used, together with a suitable expansion {{that takes into account}} the main nonlinear interactions, to discretize the shell. The resulting nonlinear equations of motion are solved by numerical integration. The fluid is assumed to be non-viscous and incompressible and its inertial effects on the shell surface are obtained by the potential flow theory. A detailed parametric analysis is carried out to demonstrate the influence of the fluid height within the shell on the parametric instability load and on the <b>snap-through</b> <b>buckling</b> load in the main parametric resonance region. Using bifurcations diagrams, the main bifurcation events associated with these stability boundaries are identified.

Here, we found that we could obtain higher impulsive motions by adding the range limitation to a passive rotational joint which makes {{the shape of the}} elastic strip just before <b>snap-through</b> <b>buckling</b> complicated.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} for unidirectional (0, 10) (sub s) and (90, 10) (sub s) plates, ((0 / 90) (sub 5) (sub s)) plates, and for aluminum plates. Results are also presented for ((+/- theta) (sub 6) (sub s)) angle-ply plates for values of theta = 30, 45, and 60 degrees. The {{results indicate that}} the change in axial stiffness of a plate at buckling is strongly dependent upon cutout size and plate orthotropy. The presence of a cutout gives rise to an internal load distribution that changes, sometimes dramatically, as a function of cutout size coupled with the plate orthotropy. In the buckled state, the role of orthotropy becomes more significant since bending in addition to membrane orthotropy is present. Most of the plates with cutouts exhibited less postbuckling stiffness than the corresponding plate without a cutout, and the postbuckling stiffness decreased with increasing cutout size. However, some of the highly orthotropic plates with cutouts exhibited more postbuckling stiffness than the corresponding plate without a cutout. These results suggest the possibility of tailoring the cutout size and the stacking sequence of a composite plate to optimize postbuckling stiffness. It was found that plates with large radius cutouts do exhibit some postbuckling strength. The results also indicate that a cutout can influence modal interaction in a plate. Specifically, results {{are presented}} that show a plate with a relatively small cutout buckling at a higher load than the corresponding plate without a cutout, due to modal interaction. Other results are presented that indicate the presence of nonlinear prebuckling deformations, due to material nonlinearity, in the angle-ply plates with theta = 45 and 60 degrees. The nonlinear prebuckling deformations are more pronounced in the plates with theta = 45 degrees and become even more pronounced as the cutout size increases. Results are also presented that show how load-path eccentricity due to improper machining of the test specimens affects the buckling behavior.

40|$|Lightweight {{structures}} {{have the}} advantages of being ecological, virtuous, and beautiful to the eyes. The transparency and the fluent geometry {{that can be achieved}} with these structures, make them a reference point in modern structural engineering. Their design and production attain to many challenging fields in engineering such as the digital fabrication, the control and optimization theory, and the smart structures. However, their slenderness returns an high sensitivity to instability problems. Stability of equilibrium has a key role in structural engineering: the multiple nature and the vast set of influencing factors makes necessary a constant investigation and development of focused approaches. Above all, the sudden character that distinguish the instabilities requires a consistent effort to assure the safety of large and slender structures. Lastly, the interactive and dynamic essence of the instability demands a complex composition of solution schemes to treat it from a static point of view. Aim of this thesis is to study the interaction between the <b>snap-through</b> and the <b>buckling</b> and its effect on maximum load reduction, imperfection sensitivity, and especially on the variation in the structural behavior. Even if the dangerousness of the phenomenon is known, the problem requires a systematic treatment that concerns the study of the equilibrium paths. The path shape and characteristic provides crucial information about variation of inner forces regime, shallowness and slenderness effects, imperfections and connections influence. Hence, {{in the first part of}} the manuscript, a focused theoretical approach is devoted to the establish the describing and discriminating parameters. Additionally, a series of numerical simulations are presented to validate the formulations. Obtained results fulfill a first step in covering the gap between the physical knowledge of the problem and its actual scientific connotation. The results find an application in the stability of reticulated structures, commonly geometrically non-linear, but also a useful tool for the design and analysis of MEMS and micro-switchers. In this scale, the interaction phenomenon is too much often used for triggering a device without being completely grasped. The heinous data about mems collapse due to pull-in instability, about more than 40 % of mems broke in this manner, is a reliable witness. In the structural engineering field, from the famous collapses of the 60 's and 70 's to the 2014 emblematic collapses of more than 100 reticulated domes in China caused by some exceptional snow storms. International organizations, such as the IASS, redacted new guideline for design, constructions and reliability of metal roofs, demonstrating a renewed interest in the interactive collapses. Among all, new methods for taking into account the imperfection sensitivity has been presented, based on probabilistic approaches. In the second part of the thesis, using the results obtained for a simple structures, the structural weaknesses and flaws are investigated. The results suggest that the methods adopted, commonly used for Fracture Mechanics, are useful for studying the local instability occurrence and consequences. For classical morphologies, such as diamatic and geodesic domes, the elastic local collapses of lateral and compressive buckling appears to be responsible for sharp load decreases. At the same time, for grid shells, the high stiffness connections required, proves to be a trigger to progressive and catastrophic collapses. Identification of snap-back phenomena in the equilibrium path of these structures are similar to the shell and cylinders collapses, where the intensity of flexural and axial regime of forces determines the catastrophic degree of the fail. The concept illustrated in this manuscript can be used for the safety assessment of lightweight structures and for optimization criteria for mems and micro-scale material structure...|$|R

The novelties reside in the nonlinear mechanism ruling the harvester behavior and the printed technology used to realize the lab-scale prototype.

More specifically, it has been shown that the dynamic buckling load corresponds unstable static equilibrium state where the total potential of the system is zero. Furthermore, it has been proved that the second variation of the total potential energy at the foregoing unstable equilibrium state is negative definite. This implies that the curves ""loading versus displacement"" resulting by vanishing the total potential has always a maximum on the above-mentioned unstable state. These findings have been verified by employing a non-linear dynamic analysis. © 1989...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} issues {{involving}} the postbuckling of doubly-curved panels exposed to a non-uniform temperature field and subjected {{to a system of}} mechanical loads are considered in this paper. Effects played by transverse shear, initial geometric imperfections, membrane and thickness-wise temperature gradient, tangential edge constraints, linear/non-linear elastic foundation are incorporated and their implications on the non-linear response behavior of shells are discussed. Issues related with the delay of the occurrence of the <b>snap-through</b> <b>buckling,</b> alleviation of its intensity and even with its removal are addressed and remarks on conditions rendering a curved panel insensitive to initial geometric imperfections are included. Results on small vibration of shells about sub- and post-critical ranges are provided and structural modeling issues playing a non-negligible role towards a reliable prediction of the postbuckling behavior of shells under complex loading conditions are discussed. Results on non-linear response of flat reinforced panels subjected to thermomechanical loads are also presented. Finally, problems not covered by this article are briefly indicated...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} investigation, the {{nonlinear}} static {{as well as}} dynamic buckling of asymmetrical suspended roofs, acted upon by step conservative loading of infinite duration is examined in detail. This is achieved via a two-degrees-of-freedom imperfect dissipative model simulating the real roof structure. Natural and complementary equilibrium paths are determined for different characteristic values of the parameters involved, revealing a variety of equilibrium configurations. Evolution from symmetry to asymmetry, especially for high roofs, changes the static response from limit point instability to monotonically rising stable paths and increases the amplitude of horizontal displacement. For all cases considered the corresponding dynamic response is associated with point attractors, being either remote stable physical equilibria or prebuckling fixed points, simultaneously locally and globally asymptotically stable, although the dynamic buckling phenomenon has already occurred. The main feature of suspended roofs - sensitivity to horizontal vibrations - is captured by the proposed model, while eliminating the effect of suspension the model yields <b>snap-through</b> <b>buckling</b> as expected...|$|E
