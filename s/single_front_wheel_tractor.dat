50|$|In 1896 he {{completed}} another four-wheeled vehicle, {{this time with}} an electric engine. It was derived from a horse-drawncarriage. His last car was built in 1898, an electric Three-wheeler with a <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> allowing {{the use of a}} long steering lever. It had a center-tube frame, and the bodywork was hinged with springs.|$|R
50|$|At Gordon, Poppe {{designed}} a three-wheeled two-seater with a <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b> The single-cylinder, 197 cc, Villiers engine was mounted {{next to the}} driver (RHD), outside of the body with an external chain-drive to one rear wheel. Access to the interior was via a single door. The steel body had a folding fabric roof, and at £300 it was the cheapest car on the UK market.|$|R
5000|$|A new Alfi company, Alfi Automobile GmbH {{was formed}} in 1927, also by Alex Fisher. This time the cars and vans were three-wheelers powered by DKW engines driving the <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b> These could be turned 180 degrees to propel the car backward. An {{additional}} four-wheeled model, the 4-wheeled Alfi Sport, had a 2/10PS engine, was bodied as an open or coupe two-seater, and was produced in small numbers.|$|R
50|$|The company only {{manufactured}} one model, a three-wheeled two seater with a <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b> The single-cylinder, 197 cc, Villiers {{engine was}} mounted {{next to the}} driver (RHD), outside of the body with an external chain-drive to one rear wheel.

5000|$|In 1945, Batley {{education}} committee bought a Graiseley for {{the delivery of}} cooked foods, particularly soup, pastries and puddings, to schools. The three-wheeled PCV was powered by a [...] motor and a 24-volt battery. The motor drove the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> through a reduction gearbox and chain. A tubular column {{at the front of}} the vehicle allowed it to be steered, and pushing it downwards applied the brakes. A separate hand-brake was also fitted, and the <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> was mounted so that it could be turned through a wide angle, giving exceptional manoeuvrability.|$|R
50|$|In 1934, Scammell {{produced}} the three-wheeled Mechanical Horse, designed by Oliver North to replace horses in rail, postal and other delivery applications. This featured automatic carriage coupling and the <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> could be steered through 360 degrees. It {{was sold in}} three- and six-ton versions. The three-tonner was powered by a 1,125-cc side-valve petrol engine and the six-tonner by a 2,043-cc engine. Karrier had introduced a similar vehicle, the Cob, four years earlier.|$|R
50|$|The Ant {{possessed a}} box section metal chassis. At the front, {{directly}} behind the <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> a 700 cc four-cylinder four-stroke engine was installed, delivering a claimed 27.5 bhp (20 kW) of power. Above the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> and engine was a glass-fibre cabin with space for two and an aerodynamic front and two round headlights. Despite its apparent simplicity the cabin design incorporated gentle curves and creases to enhance structural strength. The rear wheels drove the vehicle to a maximum speed of 54 mph (86 km/h) and overall fuel consumption of 8.1 lt./100 km was quoted.|$|R
5000|$|The Red and Black Truck is a HGV style front truck section {{vehicle with}} <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> and double back wheels. It {{can be seen}} in the pod vehicle bay in the episode [...] "Cry Wolf". Its use is, presumably, to {{transport}} or tow materials around danger zones - or within the pod vehicle bay - possibly in conjunction with the Yellow Trailer Truck. Despite it only being glimpsed once on screen, Konami issued a miniature model of the vehicle in its Pod Vehicles collection.|$|R
50|$|The {{quadricycle}} {{could be}} bought fully assembled {{or all the}} components could be purchased separately to be built by the owner. Also available was a tricycle version and a 'convertible' model that could use either a <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> or have an optional twin <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> assembly that allowed a front passenger to be carried. The only known surviving Brown Quadricycle uses a Perfecta quadricycle frame and a Starley rear axle. The engine is a 2.25 hp De Dion-Bouton engine that drives through a two speed Bozier gearbox and has been officially dated by the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain as of 1899 manufacture.|$|R
50|$|The Tata Pixel {{is able to}} {{maneuver}} and park in tight spaces due to the zero turn toroidal traction-drive, Infinitely Variable Transmission (IVT), and due to its steering system design. This results in a turning circle radius of 2.6 meters. The steering and the transmission work together so that each wheel is driven independently with inputs from the steering system. By applying reverse drive on a single rear wheel and forward drive on a <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> the car is able to turn almost in its own length.|$|R
50|$|CLEVER {{features}} a two-seat tandem layout, a <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> tilting cabin, and a two-wheeled rear engine module. The total vehicle mass is approximately 332 kg (excluding driver and bodywork); with a 75 kg driver the static weight distribution is 39% front and 61% rear. The rear module does not tilt and accounts for approximately 40% of the laden vehicle mass meaning only 60% can be tilted {{to balance the}} vehicle whilst cornering. CLEVER’s wheelbase is 2.4m, as long as many conventional city cars, {{but there are no}} overhangs so total length is under 3m. The track width is just 0.84m giving a total vehicle width of 1.00m.|$|R
50|$|Alfred Scott {{left the}} company in 1915 and after World War I formed the Scott Autocar Company in nearby Bradford to make a motorcycle/car hybrid called the Sociable. This was half sidecar and half a car 3-wheeler, {{originally}} designed for military use as a machine gun carrier, with a <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> on the offside {{in line with the}} rear wheel, creating a layout similar to a motorcycle and sidecar combination. The wooden bodywork was mounted on a tubular, triangular frame and the engine was Scott's own design, a 578 cc water-cooled, two-cylinder, two-stroke engine. The idea was not a success and production ended in 1925.|$|R
50|$|The single-cylinder models (types II and IV) had an {{air-cooled}} engine with an upright cylinder, which produced 3.5 hp (2.6 kW) from a displacement of 451 cm³ (bore × stroke = 82 × 86 mm). The engine had a high-voltage Magnetic ignition and was mounted with the three-speed gearbox on the <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> which was propelled by a chain. The transmission was actuated by a right-hand-side slide mechanism. The wheelbase was 2000 mm, the {{track of the}} rear axle 1150 mm {{and the length of}} the vehicles about 2950 mm. The weight of the chassis was 300 kg, and the top speed 35 km / h.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> brake can yield large deceleration on underbone motorcycle. However, the motorcycle motion potentially {{exposed to the}} nosedive effect during this application. Therefore, {{in order to avoid}} this issue, the {{application of}} concurrent brake are required. Hence, this research was carried out to understand the basic braking performance for underbone motorcycle and elucidate the influenced of concurrent braking application involving the front and rear brake component. A theoritical study was carried out in this work through the derivation of motion equation for underbone motorcycle. The preliminary results showed that the total brake force and the brake force component acting on the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> had increased linearly with its deceleration intensity. Further study showed that in order to achieve higher safety range, the brake force applied on the <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> should be at least 70 % higher than the rear brake force intensity. This is probably due to the weight transferred condition during the underbone motorcycle braking...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the original solutions adopted for powering a nonconventional three-wheel electric vehicle. This is a lightweight vehicle {{for use in}} urban mobility with mission tasks such as 50 -km/h cruising speed and 80 -km range of autonomy. The propulsion system {{is based on a}} lead-acid battery-fed wheel direct drive. This is arranged with a 4. 5 -kW prototype of a slotless axial-flux permanent magnet machine, which has a total weight of 15 kg and is capable of 85 -Nm continuous torque and 120 -Nm peak torque over 2 min. The motor is totally enclosed in the <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> of the vehicle and fed through an IGBT bidirectional power converter, which allows the control of both motoring and regenerative braking operations.

50|$|Until {{the late}} 1920s {{the efforts to}} unify a boat and an {{automobile}} mostly came down to simply putting wheels and axles on a boat hull, or getting a rolling chassis to float by blending a boat-like hull with the car's frame. One of the first reasonably well documented cases was the 1905 amphibious petrol-powered carriage of T. Richmond (Jessup, Iowa, USA). Just like the world's first petrol-powered automobile (1885, Carl Benz) it was a three-wheeler. The <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> provided direction, both on land and in the water. A three-cylinder petrol combustion-engine powered the oversized rear wheels. In {{order to get the}} wheels to provide propulsion in the water, fins or buckets would be attached to the rear wheel spokes. Remarkably the boat-like hull {{was one of the first}} integral bodies ever used on a car.|$|R
50|$|The current {{flagship}} {{is known}} as Aurora Evolution (Previously Aurora 101). The car weighs 120 kg without batteries or a driver and has attained speeds of 155 km/h. It is built around a triangular carbon fibre frame (with a circular cross section) with a <b>single</b> driven <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> and two rear wheels. The car's body {{is attached to the}} frame at three points through springs and shock absorbers.|$|R
50|$|The 101 {{used the}} 201 in³ (3,292 cc) six, taking {{advantage}} of its stock electric start, a first in a tractor. Run at much lower revs than the truck engine, the 101 came in the usual standard and row-crop models, with four-speed transmission, and was capable of 20 mph (32 km/h) on roads. The row-crop model offered adjustable rear wheel spacing and rear wheel brakes, as well as PTO. There was also a rare model with a <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b> They also featured hood sides with dozens of louvers, which disappeared late in 1941. The Super was upgraded to the 217 in³ (3,554 cc) Chrysler in 1940, giving it almost 50 hp (37 kW) at the belt, {{making it one of}} the most powerful tractors on the market that year. It continued to be used in the 101 Super until 1940, when it was supplanted by the 217 in³ (3,554 cc).|$|R
5000|$|The Davis Divan was {{the brainchild}} of Glen Gordon [...] "Gary" [...] Davis, a used-car {{salesman}} from Indiana. Its immediate predecessor was a custom three-wheeled roadster called [...] "The Californian", which had been built in 1941 by future Indianapolis 500 racing car designer Frank Kurtis for Southern Californian millionaire and racer Joel Thorne, who was the heir to the Chase bank fortune. For the <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> of [...] "The Californian", Kurtis had taken inspiration from the Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter aircraft, while he also fitted the vehicle with a Ford V8/60 engine and rear axle. In 1945, shortly after moving to Southern California, Davis purchased the car from Thorne. He paid just $50 for it, and while reports about the circumstances of the sale vary, one suggests that Davis may have deliberately crashed the accident-prone vehicle during a test drive to reduce its value to Thorne.|$|R
40|$|A {{compensator}} {{is derived}} {{for a class}} of nonholonomic systems incorporating both dynamically coupled and uncoupled actuators. The compensator affords exponential convergence to smooth trajectories in a reduced state space. 1 Introduction In control engineering practice it {{is often the case}} that one uses actuator subsystems that are designed so that the internal dynamics of actuation are unaffected by the plant dynamics. Consider a three-wheel cart with two parallel rear wheels on a fixed axle, and a <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> of negligible moment of inertia on a vertical steering axis. In a dynamic model of the cart the steering angle does not appear as a generalized coordinate of the mechanical system, though it affects the system trajectory through the constraint that the wheels roll without slipping. In this paper the manner in which decoupled controls affect the dynamics of the plant through the nonholonomic constraints is studied. A tracking control law for smooth trajectories consistent [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The 1-ton {{version of}} their PCV {{was given a}} 2-day road test by L J Cotton for Commercial Motor in August 1951. By this time, steel had been {{replaced}} by extrusions and sheets of light alloy, to reduce the weight of the vehicle. The battery was mounted in the centre of the vehicle, to maintain stability, and the [...] electric motor was mounted above the rear axle, powering both rear wheels through helical gears, to provide good traction is icy conditions. The <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> was steered by a tiller, and because it was mounted in front of the load compartment, could be turned through 90 degrees to left or right, making the vehicle highly manoeuvrable. No reverse gear was provided, but this was achieved by lifting a safety catch and turning the tiller through 180 degrees in relation to the wheel. All controls were mounted on the tiller, and the model tested was called the Marathon.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop {{appropriate}} guiding system based on this method. In the proposed system there is a soil-engaging sensing arm to follow a furrow made in previous pass and firstly by driver. This system is a mechanical guidance system as an aid to manual steering. The driver would make the first pass and headland turnings. During subsequent passes the driver will be free to concentrate on engine speed, Ploughing depth, etc., whilst the self steering device maintains the tractor in correct pass relative to the previous furrow. A sensor attached to the tractor carried a pivoted furrow follower arm which projected between the <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> of <b>tractor</b> and parallel to the furrow. Through a series of linkages the movement of furrow follower was transferred to an angle sensor. It produces an appropriate signal for controlling the steering wheels.

2500|$|At the {{motorcycle}} show in November 1951, Sharp's announced what they described as [...] "a revolutionary {{design in the}} field of commercial vehicles". [...] The Sharp's Commercial 3 Cwt took the concept of the Minicar's light, three-wheeled, utilitarian design, and adapted it as the basis for an open-top lightweight industrial vehicle. The yellow and black prototype at the show was powered by an Indian Brave [...] four-stroke side valve engine (supplied by Brockhouse Engineering Co., Southport) and mounted in a cradle ahead and above the <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b> Though described as [...] "constructed on the stressed-skin principle", large cut outs to allow easy access from either side of the vehicle required much additional strengthening to the floor, with a central steel backbone girder, a cross member between the rear wheels and further triangular bracing. The single seat was located centrally as was the steering wheel. Steering was by worm and sector, and flared side panels allowed the <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> to turn a full 180°, making the vehicle extremely manoeuvrable. The entire engine, drive-train and steering unit could be removed by undoing four bolts to allow for easy servicing. Unlike the Minicar, there were brakes on all three wheels and there was a wooden-slatted floor behind the driver. Though the Sharp's Commercial never entered production, it served as a forerunner to van and pickup versions of the Mark B which appeared in 1952.|$|R

This way he could then devote his personal attention to the engine and automobile when he could from his businesses he was running there. The automobile consisted of two clutches and two chains, which were connected to a jack shaft. The two clutches gave two speeds forward and there was no reverse speed used. The <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> of the tricycle designed automobile was steered by a foot lever and a hand lever.

5000|$|Commercial Motor {{carried a}} review of the Graiseley PCV in 1940, which stated that this model had been in service with {{commercial}} operators, including bakeries and dairies, for two years. It came with a [...] motor, and was designed to travel at 3 mph, with a range of 8 to 10 mi on normal door-to-door delivery work. It could be supplied as a flat platform truck, with an open body suitable for milk delivery, or as a closed van, suitable for delivering bread. The motor, gearbox and an automatic clutch were mounted on the <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> forks. A chain formed part of the final drive. The control system included a contactor manufactured by British Thompson-Houston, and the centrifugal drum clutch was designed to engage when the motor reached 250 revs per minute, providing a smooth start without the need for starting resistors. The three-wheeled PCV was produced in three sizes, the Model 60, with a payload of 8-10 cwt, the Model 75, with a 12-15 cwt payload, and the Model 90, which could carry 22 cwt. Because the primary focus was on the dairy industry, the model numbers represented the number of imperial gallons of milk that could be carried.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} Farmall {{is widely}} viewed as the first tractor to combine a set of traits that would define the row-crop tractor category, although competition in the category came quickly. Although {{it was not the}} first tractor to have any one of these traits, it was early in bringing the winning combination to market. The traits included (a) 'tricycle' [...] (a <b>single</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> or narrowly spaced pair), high ground clearance, quickly adjustable axle track, excellent visibility all around and under the machine, and light weight; (b) sufficient power for plowing and harrowing, and a belt pulley for belt work; and (c) all at low cost, with a familiar brand and an extensive distribution and service network. The first group of traits allowed for more nimble maneuvering and accurate cultivation than most other tractors of the day; additionally, because of the second group, the Farmall could also, like previous tractors, perform all the other duties a farmer would have previously achieved using a team of horses. A tractor could yield lower overall operating costs than horses {{as long as it was}} priced right and reliable (and its fuel supply as well). The Farmall, mass-produced with the same low-cost-and-high-value ethos as the Ford Model T or Fordson tractor, could meet that requirement. The Farmall was thus similar to a Fordson in its capabilities and affordability, but with better cultivating ability.|$|R
