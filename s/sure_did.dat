500|$|Unfortunately, {{their journey}} {{does not pay}} off well. The {{customer}} is revealed to be Tom (a recurring character throughout the series), who is at first happy that he finally got his pizza, until he discovers {{he did not get}} the drink he claims to have asked for. A confused SpongeBob checks the order, which says that Tom didn't order a drink (although it is heavily implied that Mr. Krabs didn't hear Tom's order correctly or that he hung up before Tom had a chance to finish). His blood boiling with anger, Tom harshly berates SpongeBob and refuses to take the pizza or pay for it before slamming the door. SpongeBob goes back to Squidward and collapses to the ground and cries (while absorbing his tears). Infuriated that Tom berated SpongeBob and won't pay for the pizza all because of a missing drink (making the long journey and the ridiculous obstacles the duo went through a complete waste of time), Squidward confronts Tom who arrogantly says, [...] "Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't payin' for that!" [...] to which Squidward angrily claims, [...] "Well, this one's on the house!" [...] and brutally shoves the pizza into Tom's face as payback for his rudeness. Squidward then goes back to SpongeBob who, stilling crying, asks, [...] "Did he change his mind?" [...] Squidward cheers him up by saying, [...] "He <b>sure</b> <b>did.</b> Ate the whole thing in one bite." [...] The two then drive back to the Krusty Krab, which is comically revealed to be right across the street, much to Squidward's dismay, who then says [...] "Oh, my aching tentacles!".|$|E

2500|$|The seventh-ranked 1966 Florida Gators {{entered the}} game with a 7–0 record and the {{opportunity}} to clinch a share of their first-ever SEC title. [...] The Gators' senior quarterback, Steve Spurrier, had just locked up the Heisman trophy the previous week with a stellar performance versus the Auburn Tigers. [...] The Florida–Georgia game turned out very differently, however, as the Bulldogs defense dominated the game, and Spurrier threw three interceptions in the 27–10 Georgia victory. [...] All-American defensive tackle Bill Stanfill would later reference Spurrier in recounting his experiences growing up on a farm in southwest Georgia before the advent of weightlifting: [...] "Holding pigs for my dad to castrate was quite a challenge. I can't say that helped prepare me for football, but it <b>sure</b> <b>did</b> remind me an awful lot of sacking Steve Spurrier." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, {{he became}} {{involved}} in the Demidenko/Darville affair, in which it was discovered that Helen Darville, who had won several major literary awards for her novel The Hand That Signed the Paper was not the daughter of a Ukrainian immigrant, as she had said, but the child of English migrants. Murray said of Darville that [...] "She was a young girl, and her book mightn't have been the best in the world, but it was pretty damn good for a girl of her age [...] And her marketing strategy of pretending to be a Ukrainian might have been unwise, but it <b>sure</b> <b>did</b> expose the pretensions of the multicultural industry". Biographer Alexander writes that in his poem [...] "A Deployment of Fashion", Murray linked [...] "the attack on Darville with the wider phenomenon of attacks on those judged outcasts (from Lindy Chamberlain to Pauline Hanson) by society’s fashion police, the journalists, academics and others who form opinion (p.282). In 1996, he was embroiled in a controversy about whether Australian historian, Manning Clark, had received and regularly worn the medal of the Order of Lenin (p 276).|$|E
