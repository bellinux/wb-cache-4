40|$|Tire studs {{are being}} used during winter {{in a number of}} {{countries}} worldwide in order to ensure a more secure and reliable mobility in those countries. For example, more than 60 % of the passenger cars in Sweden use studded tires during wintertime. A tire stud consists of a body made out of aluminum and a pin, which consists of cemented tungsten carbide with cobalt (WC- Co). This is an extremely hard and tough material that improves the driving conditions on slippery winter roads. In this way, human health impacts associated with traffic accidents and fatal crashes are reduced. On the other hand, the use of tire <b>stud</b> <b>pins</b> causes human health impacts since inhalable particles worn from the road can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Other factors, including emissions of toxic substances and occupational health hazards during the production of tire studs, also contribute to negative health impacts. Emissions from ore tailings during mining are known to release considerable amounts of toxic metals and the high energy use during WC-Co production indicate the possibility of notable emissions related to energy production. Furthermore, tungsten is a conflict mineral and thereby contributes, among other factors, to civil warfare in e. g. the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Cobalt is not defined as a conflict mineral but is also mined in that region. The aim {{of this study is to}} answer the question of whether the use of tire <b>stud</b> <b>pins</b> results in net health improvements or not. This was assessed by conducting a cradle to grave life cycle assessment (LCA) focusing on human health impacts related to the use of tire <b>stud</b> <b>pins.</b> All processes from the extraction of tungsten and cobalt, to waste management of tire studs, were considered. The impact category human health was operationalized by the disability adjusted life years (DALY) indicator, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted for relevant parameters, including the varying tungsten content of tire <b>stud</b> <b>pins.</b> An explorative scenario accounting for human health impacts related to tungsten being a conflict mineral was also employed. This was done in order to investigate if the results would be affected applying a wider system boundary. This study can support societal decisions related to tire studs, including both requirements and prohibitions, by evaluating from a life cycle perspective to what extent tire studs succeed with their intended purpose. Their purpose of enabling a more secure mobility in colder countries by saving lives and avoiding injuries...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} shear-carrying {{structures}} very often profits by the dowel action developed by reinforcing bars or shear connectors, since dowel action is, in principle, a very efficient shear-transfer mechanism. Within the same element, the reinforcing bars may act as dowels {{as soon as}} stress-induced interfaces form (cracks in the ultimate load situation), while shear connectors between side-by-side elements (<b>studs,</b> <b>pins,</b> dowels) develop a dowel action {{from the very beginning}} of the loading process, including the service load situation. Within this framework an experimental program has been carried out to investigate the dowel action in 27 reinforced concrete specimens fitted up with a single deformed bar of 14, 18, and 24 -mm diameter (No. 5, 6, and 8). The shear response of the dowel bar, the displacements and curvatures up to failure, and the subgrade stiffness of the concrete embedment were measured or evaluated. The tests give new evidence on the behavior of dowel action and allow further checks of the models available in literature for predicing dowel strength and stiffness. Furthermore, suitable formulations are proposed for the subgrade stiffness of the concrete embedment to allow the professional engineer to design a dowel bar or introduce dowel action in a safer and more consistent way...|$|R

Turning {{is the most}} common process used {{in manufacturing}} sector to produce smooth finish on cylindrical surfaces. Surface roughness is the important performance characteristics to be considered in the turning process is affected by several factors such as cutting tool material, spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut and material properties. In this research Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to determine the optimum machining parameters leading to minimum surface roughness in turning process. The main purpose of this research is to study the effect of carbide inserts on EN- 24 Alloy Steel surface by using three parameters (spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut). This research was conducted by using 100 HS Stallion CNC Lathe machine. Seventeen sets of experiments were performed. In this work empirical models were developed for surface roughness by considering spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut as main controlling factors using response surface methodology. The optimum value of the surface roughness (Ra) comes out to be 0. 48 µm. It is also concluded that feed rate is the most significant factor affecting surface roughness followed by depth of cut. As Cutting speed is the less significant factor affecting surface roughness. Optimum results are finally verified with the help of confirmation experiments. Keywords...|$|R

50|$|A type of {{stud welding}} called capacitor-discharge (CD) stud welding differs from regular stud welding in that capacitor-discharge welding {{does not require}} flux. The weld time is shorter, {{enabling}} the weld to bond with little oxidation and no need for heat concentration. It also allows for small-diameter studs to be welded to thin,lightweight materials. This process uses a direct-current arc from a capacitor. The weld time in this process is between 1 and 6 milliseconds. Capacitor discharge stud welding with the latest equipment can create a weld without burn through showing {{on the opposite side}} of very thin metals. CD stud welding is often used for smaller diameter <b>studs</b> and <b>pins,</b> as well as on non-standard materials and for accuracy. On the other hand, arc stud welding is primarily for structural purposes and larger diameter weld studs.|$|R

50|$|First {{seen in the}} United States {{and then}} England, the rocker fashion style {{was born out of}} {{necessity}} and practicality. Rockers wore heavily decorated leather motorcycle jackets, often adorned with metal <b>studs,</b> patches, <b>pin</b> badges and sometimes an Esso gas man trinket. When they rode their motorcycles, they usually wore no helmet, or wore a classic open-face helmet, aviator goggles and a white silk scarf (to protect them from the elements). Other common items included: T-shirts, leather caps, Levi's or Wrangler jeans, leather trousers, tall motorcycle boots (often made by Lewis Leathers and Goldtop) or brothel creepers. Also popular was a patch declaring membership of the 59 Club of England, a church-based youth organization that later formed into a motorcycle club with members all over the world. The rocker hairstyle, kept in place with Brylcreem, was usually a tame or exaggerated pompadour hairstyle, as was popular with some 1950s rock and roll musicians.|$|R

The performance of the BEM program on the pin fin was measured (as computational time) and used as a performance comparison with the FEM model. Given similar surface element densities, the BEM method took longer to get a solution than the FEM method.

40|$|Tire <b>studs,</b> with <b>pins</b> {{typically}} {{made out}} of cemented carbide with cobalt (WC-Co), are used in several countries to improve the gripping power during winter. Throughout their use, the tire studs are worn. This leads to emissions of particles, of which some are nano-sized. Until now, WC-Co nanoparticles have seldom been included in environmental risk assessments of nanomaterials. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the magnitude of emissions of WC-Co (nano) particles from tire studs on a national level, compare WC-Co emissions to those of other nanomaterials, and conduct a screening risk assessment of the WC-Co emissions. The country in focus was Sweden, where 66 % of the passenger cars use studded tires during winter. Substance flow analysis (SFA) was used to quantify the mass flows related to tire studs from the raw material extraction phase to the waste management phase. Furthermore, particle flow analysis (PFA) was used to quantify particle number flows in the use phase, where emissions of W-containing nanoparticles have been observed. As part of these quantifications, use phase emissions of WC-Co nanoparticles were calculated using a leaching-type model based on the number of km driven by the Swedish car fleet and experimental measurements of W-emission rates. Two scenarios – a low-emission and a high-emission scenario – were employed. Preliminary results show annual WC-Co emissions of 10 - 10 ^ 3 kg/year and 10 ^ 15 - 10 ^ 20 particles/year. These estimated emissions were then compared to estimated emissions of some other nanomaterials in Sweden, including silver, titanium dioxide, cerium oxide, fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. This comparison indicated that the emissions of WC-Co nanoparticles from tire studs are in the same range as estimated emissions of some of these other nanomaterials. Our estimation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of WC-Co nanoparticles in road runoff was in the same order of magnitude as measured environmental concentrations (MEC) of W-containing particles. The limited existing ecotoxicity data indicate that much higher concentrations are required in order to reach toxic levels, but further studies are needed to confirm this. Overall, the notable emissions of WC-Co nanoparticles during the use of tire studs support the further study and inclusion of this material in risk-related studies of nanoparticles...|$|R
