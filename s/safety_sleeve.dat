40|$|In {{the case}} of {{designing}} high-speed surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor (SPMSM), the rotor retaining sleeve is inserted into the rotor to prevent the permanent magnet&# 39;s damage. It is quite {{an efficient way to}} consider manufacturability, but the sleeve becomes the major source of ohm loss in high-speed operation. In this paper, the high-speed motor for a turbo blower at the rating of 100 kW, 20 000 r/min was introduced. To improve its efficiency, the retaining sleeve&# 39;s optimal design was needed. For this, parametric analysis on the shape of the retaining sleeve was carried out in a different type of motor. Within a range that meets the mechanical <b>safety,</b> <b>sleeve</b> designs have been changed. The effect of changing design variables of the sleeve was studied. This paper presents the optimized sleeve&# 39;s advantages in electrical efficiency from the results of the electromagnetic finite element analysis software. Finally, it suggests the optimal sleeve design to reduce eddy-current loss, which is related to motor shape.

40|$|In Nature, {{most of all}} Metals evolve as stable ores of {{chemical}} compounds like oxides, sulphides or carbonates. Lot of energy is required to refine and make them useful for some means for every Industry. Corrosion on metals can reverse an unnatural process back to a lower state of energy, easily as simple. It eats away metal in outdoor furniture and automotive bodies, leaving the surface with bad appearance {{and if it is}} not treated at right time, eventually it will lead to failure. Corrosion causes rusting the cookware and tarnishing of silver parts. Of greater importance, corrosion takes place on Steel bars in reinforced concrete result in failure of highway section, damage to big buildings, even collapse of towers that may take lives of many and leads to significant loss of resources. Hence, Corrosion prevention would be an important step for any industry, especially oil and gas Industry where corrosion is a serious ageing mechanism which impacts the equipment of Subsea, Surface, refineries and process plants. The present study is on localised corrosion happen in <b>Safety</b> Joint, inner <b>sleeve</b> and most design feasible corrosion monitoring equipment based on cost measures has been identified. Different types of Corrosion monitoring equipment’s for offline and online monitoring are discussed and GE RADAR Inspection with use of Ultrasound inspection technology has been identified as most feasible equipment. Equipment tool head can pass through safety joint bore during scheduled inspection intervals and which could take photographs of slots of inner sleeve where there is continuous flow of sand particles, due to accumulated sand on pressure chamber of safety joint which would create a threat of corrosion or erosion corrosion. Second feasible solution for corrosion monitoring would be real time installed corrosion monitoring device called Clamp on Corrosion Monitoring equipment, considering the investment Cost (Development and Installation Cost) of clamp on corrosion monitoring equipment, changing the material of to corrosion resistant alloy with required strength (Alloy 718) would be more effective solution for <b>Safety</b> Joint Inner <b>Sleeve...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{evidence}} {{regarding the}} effectiveness and <b>safety</b> of laparoscopic <b>sleeve</b> gastrectomy (LSG) has been mostly {{based on the}} data derived from nonrandomized studies. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the outcomes of LSG and to present an up-to-date review of the available evidence based on the recent publications of new randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched until November 2012 for RCTs on LSG. Fifteen RCTs, comprising a total of 1191 patients, of whom 795 had undergone LSG, were included. No patient required conversion to open surgery for LSG, laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGB), or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) procedures. There were no deaths, and the complication rate was 12. 1 % (range 10 %- 13. 2 %) in the LSG group versus 20. 9 % (range 10 %- 26. 4 %) in the LGB group, and 0 % in the LAGB group (only 1 RCT). The complications included leakage, bleeding, stricture, and reoperation that occurred with rates of. 9 %, 3. 3 %, 0 %, and 2. 1 %, respectively, in the LSG group and rates of 0 %, 5 %, 0 %, and 4 %, respectively, in the LGB group. The average operating time in the LSG group was 106. 5 minutes versus 132. 3 minutes in the LGB group. The percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) ranged from 49 % to 81 % in the LSG group, from 62. 1 % to 94. 4 % in the LGB group, and from 28. 7 % to 48 % in the LAGB group, with a follow-up ranging from 6 months to 3 years. The type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) remission rate ranged from 26. 5 % to 75 % in the LSG group and from 42 % to 93 % in the LGB group. LSG is a well-tolerated, feasible procedure with a relatively short operating time. Its effectiveness in terms of weight loss is confirmed for short-term follow-up (≤ 3 years). The role of LSG in the treatment of T 2 DM requires further investigation...|$|R
