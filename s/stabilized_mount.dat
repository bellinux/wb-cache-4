40|$|This {{research}} was to exploit hyperspectral reflectance imaging technology for the detection and mapping variability (clutter) of the natural background against which gases in the atmosphere are imaged. The natural background consists of landscape surface cover composed of consolidated rocks, unconsolidated rock weathering products, soils, coatings on rock materials, vegetation, water, materials constructed by humans, and mixtures of the above. Human made gases in the atmosphere may indicate industrial processes important to detecting non-nuclear chemical and biological proliferation. Our {{research was}} to exploit the Visible and Near-Infrared (NIR) and the Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) portions {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} to determine the properties of solid materials on the earth’s surface that could influence the detection of gases in the Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR). We used some new experimental hyperspectral imaging technologies to collect data over the Non-Proliferation Test and Evaluation Center (NPTEC) located on the Nevada Test Site (NTS). The SpecTIR HyperSpecTIR (HST) and Specim Dual hyperspectral sensors were used to understand the variability in the imaged background (clutter), that detected, measured, identified and mapped with operational commercial hyperspectral techniques. The HST sensors were determined to be more experimental than operational because of problems with radiometric and atmospheric data correction. However the SpecTIR Dual system, developed by Specim in Finland, eventually was found to provide cost-effective hyperspectral image data collection and it was possible to correct the Dual system’s data for specific areas. Batch processing of long flightlines was still complex, and if comparison to laboratory spectra was desired, the Dual system data still had to be processed using the empirical line method. This research determined that 5 -meter spatial resolution was adequate for mapping natural background variations. Furthermore, this research determined that spectral resolution of 10 um was adequate, but a signal to noise above 300 : 1 was desirable for hyperspectral sensors with this spectral resolution. Finally, we acquired a hyperspectral thermal dataset (SEBASS) at 3 m spatial resolution over our study area in Beatty, Nevada that can be co-registered with the hyperspectral reflectance, LIDAR and digital Orthophoto data sets. This data set will enable us to quantify how measurements in the reflected infrared {{can be used to make}} inferences about the response of materials in the thermal infrared, the topic of our follow-on NA- 22 investigation ending in 2008. These data provide the basis for our investigations proposed for the NA- 22 2008 Broad Area Announcement. Beginning in June 2008, SpecTIR Corporation and Aerospace Corporation plan to fly the SpecTIR Dual and SEBASS in a <b>stabilized</b> <b>mount</b> in a twin Otter aircraft. This research provides the foundation for using reflected and emitted hyperspectral measurements together for mapping geologic and soil materials in arid to semi-arid regions...|$|E

50|$|In spatial scanning, each {{two-dimensional}} (2-D) {{sensor output}} represents a full slit spectrum (x,λ). Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) devices for spatial scanning obtain slit spectra by projecting {{a strip of}} the scene onto a slit and dispersing the slit image with a prism or a grating. These systems have the drawback of having the image analyzed per lines (with a push broom scanner) and also having some mechanical parts integrated into the optical train. With these line-scan systems, the spatial dimension is collected through platform movement or scanning. This requires <b>stabilized</b> <b>mounts</b> or accurate pointing information to ‘reconstruct’ the image. Nonetheless, line-scan systems are particularly common in remote sensing, where it is sensible to use mobile platforms. Line-scan systems are also used to scan materials moving by on a conveyor belt. A special case of line scanning is point scanning (with a whisk broom scanner), where a point-like aperture is used instead of a slit, and the sensor is essentially one-dimensional instead of 2-D.|$|R

It essentially combines the stabilized steady footage of a regular mount with the fluidity and flexibility of a handheld camera. The inventor of the Steadicam, Garrett Brown, was heavily involved with the production of The Shining. Brown has described his excitement taking his first tour of the sets which offered [...] "further possibilities for the Steadicam". This tour convinced Brown to become personally involved with the production. Kubrick was not [...] "just talking of stunt shots and staircases". Rather he would use the Steadicam [...] "as it was intended to be used— as a tool which can help get the lens where it's wanted in space and time without the classic limitations of the dolly and crane". Brown used an 18mm Cooke lens that allowed the Steadicam to pass within an inch of walls and door frames. Brown published an article in American Cinematographer about his experience, and contributed to the audio commentary on the 2007 DVD release.|$|R

40|$|The {{control of}} nonholonomic systems is a {{challenging}} theoretical {{problem that has}} numerous engineering applications. One such interesting application is the control of wheeled mobile robots. This thesis presents four approaches {{that can be used}} to control these nonholonomic systems. The first three approaches are used to <b>stabilize</b> a robot <b>mounted</b> on a two-wheeled cart, while the fourth one <b>stabilized</b> a robot <b>mounted</b> on a four-wheeled cart. Feedback linearization can stabilize or track the position but not the orientation of the cart, so practical stabilization can be achieved by tracking a continuously moving reference cart. A geometric approach can stabilize the position and orientation of the cart but leads to discontinuous controls. The Lyapunov function approach applies an intelligent trick to the orientation angle and succeeds in stabilizing the cart using continuous controls. The simple feedback for nonholonomic chains approach partitions a system in chained form into two subsystems and uses a switching control law to achieve practical stabilization. All the approaches are simulated to illustrate their characteristic properties...|$|R

TRAM also allowed the Intruder to autonomously designate and drop laser-guided bombs. In addition, the Intruder used Airborne Moving Target Indicator (AMTI), which allowed the aircraft to track a moving target (such as a tank or truck) and drop ordnance on it even though the target was moving. Also, the computer system allowed the use of Offset Aim Point (OAP), giving the crew the ability to drop on a target unseen on radar by noting coordinates of a known target nearby and entering the offset range and bearing to the unseen target.|$|R
