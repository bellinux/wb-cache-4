40|$|Constructing {{illustrations}} by computer {{can be both}} tedious and difficult. This thesis introduces five example-based techniques to facilitate the process. These techniques are independently useful, but also interrelate in interesting ways: • Graphical <b>Search</b> and <b>Replace,</b> the analogue to textual <b>search</b> and <b>replace</b> in text editors, is useful for making repetitive changes throughout graphical documents. • Constraint-Based <b>Search</b> and <b>Replace,</b> an extension to graphical <b>search</b> and <b>replace,</b> allows users to define their own illustration beautification rules and constraint inferencing rules by demonstration. • Constraint Inferencing from Multiple Snapshots facilitates constraint specification by automatically computing constraints that hold in multiple configurations of an illustration. • Editable Graphical Histories, a visual representation of commands in a graphical user interface, are useful for reviewing, undoing, and redoing sets of operations. • Graphical Macros By Example, based on this history representation, allow users to scroll through previously executed commands and encapsulate useful sequences into macros. These macros can be generalized into procedures, with arguments and flow o...|$|R

5000|$|The GFP {{mechanism}} was {{the first}} mechanism to find application in sponsored <b>search,</b> <b>replacing</b> the [...] "flat fee" [...] and [...] "per-impression" [...] model that was the standard. Overture adopted the GFP mechanism in 1997, and provided service to Yahoo! and MSN. Although very successful initially, bidders quickly learned how to manipulate the mechanism. Bidding patterns exhibited a characteristic saw-tooth pattern, and the mechanism need not possess a (pure) Nash equilibrium. These deficiencies lead to {{the replacement of the}} GFP mechanism in practice, and the adoption of alternate auction designs.|$|R

Pam explains to the camera that originally, Michael based his incompetent sidekick on Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), but later changed the name with a <b>search</b> and <b>replace.</b> Unfortunately, the <b>search</b> and <b>replace</b> mechanism failed to change Dwight's misspelled name. Dwight is upset and quickly shuts down the exercise to invite everyone to set off fireworks outside, but only Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) follows.|$|R

40|$|Proc. Berliner Infromatik-Tage, 72 - 81, 1989 This paper {{describes}} a general purpose text {{database management system}} SIGMA that exploits very fast and efficient one-way sequential processing of text files. For the implementation, a fast pattern matching algorithm which can deal with multiple keys is designed to realize commands for <b>searching,</b> <b>replacing</b> and extracting keys. The algorithm also copes with Japanese texts containing both 1 -byte and 2 -byte characters with shift codes. A new file system is also designed to manage large text files efficiently. The system SIGMA is now working at the Computer Center of Kyushu University for large scale text detabases, natural language analysis and bibliographic retrievals...|$|R
