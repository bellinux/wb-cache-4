2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause for the}} split was the proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race. In {{one of her most}} controversial actions, Anthony campaigned against the amendment. She and Stanton called for women and African Americans to be enfranchised at the same time. They said that by effectively enfranchising all men while excluding all women, the amendment would create an [...] "aristocracy of sex" [...] by giving constitutional authority to the idea that men were superior to women. [...] In 1873, Anthony said, [...] "An oligarchy of wealth, where the rich govern the poor; an oligarchy of learning, where the educated govern the ignorant; or even an oligarchy of race, where the Saxon rules the African, might be endured; but <b>surely</b> <b>this</b> oligarchy of sex, which makes the men of every household sovereigns, masters; the women subjects, slaves; carrying dissension, rebellion into every home of the Nation, cannot be endured." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sonnet 128 is {{comparable}} to the sonnet in Romeo and Juliet in which Romeo pleads for a first kiss. Like that pilgrim/saint tête-à-tête, this sonnet is set in a public musical celebration. Shakespeare watches his dark lady play the keyboard virginal (or Bassano built clavichord), captivated by her back swaying with the melody. Like Romeo, he longs for a kiss, but in this sonnet he envies the jacks (wooden keys) that the lady's playing fingers [...] "tickle" [...] while trilling the notes. Perhaps he also envies the other men (Jacks) standing around the lady. <b>Surely,</b> <b>this</b> is an amusing scene to Shakespeare because he secretly is having an affair with the dark lady. He decides not to envy those keys—although he would like to be tickled as they are—but hopes instead to receive a kiss on his lips. Fred Blick points out that this plea for a [...] "kiss", leaving the fingers to the jacks, is a compromise, just as the tuning of the virginal or other keyboard instrument is, in musical temperament, a compromise.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} the way courts utilize the Preamble is Ellis v. City of Grand Rapids. Substantively, the case was about eminent domain. The City of Grand Rapids wanted to use eminent domain to force landowners to sell {{property}} in the city identified as [...] "blighted", and convey the property to owners that would develop it in ostensibly beneficial ways: in this case, to St. Mary's Hospital, a Catholic organization. This area of substantive constitutional law is governed by the Fifth Amendment, which is understood to require that property acquired via eminent domain must be put to a [...] "public use". In deciding whether the proposed project constituted a [...] "public use", the court pointed to the Preamble's reference to [...] "promot the general Welfare" [...] as evidence that [...] "he health of the people was {{in the minds of}} our forefathers". [...] "he concerted effort for renewal and expansion of hospital and medical care centers, as a part of our nation's system of hospitals, is as a public service and use within the highest meaning of such terms. <b>Surely</b> <b>this</b> is in accord with an objective of the United States Constitution: '* * * promote the general Welfare." ...|$|E
