50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common use of {{centrifugal}} switches is within single-phase, split-phase induction motors. Here, the switch is used to disconnect the <b>starting</b> <b>winding</b> of the motor once the motor approaches its normal operating speed. In this case, the centrifugal switch consists of weights mounted to the shaft of the motor and held near the shaft by spring force. At rest, levers attached to the weights press a low-friction, non-conductive plate against a set of electrical contacts mounted to the motor housing, closing the contacts and connecting the <b>starting</b> <b>winding</b> to the power source. When the motor approaches its normal operating speed, centrifugal force overcomes the spring force and the weights swing out, raising the plate away from the electrical contacts. This allows the contacts to open and disconnects the <b>starting</b> <b>winding</b> from the power source; the motor then continues operating solely using its running winding. Motors using such a centrifugal switch make a distinct clicking noise when starting and stopping as the centrifugal switch opens and closes.|$|E
50|$|In {{single phase}} {{squirrel}} cage motors, the primary winding within the motor housing is {{not capable of}} starting a rotational motion on the rotor, but is capable of sustaining one. To start the motor, a secondary winding is used in series with a non-polarized starting capacitor to introduce a lag in the sinusoidal current through the <b>starting</b> <b>winding.</b> When the secondary winding is placed at an angle {{with respect to the}} primary winding, a rotating electric field is created. The force of the rotational field is not constant, but is sufficient to start the rotor spinning. When the rotor comes close to operating speed, a centrifugal switch (or current-sensitive relay in series with the main winding) disconnects the capacitor. The start capacitor is typically mounted {{to the side of the}} motor housing. These are called capacitor-start motors, and have relatively high starting torque.|$|E
50|$|A {{split-phase}} motor has {{a secondary}} startup winding that is 90 electrical {{degrees to the}} main winding, always centered directly between the poles of the main winding, and connected to the main winding {{by a set of}} electrical contacts. The coils of this winding are wound with fewer turns of smaller wire than the main winding, so it has a lower inductance and higher resistance. The position of the winding creates a small phase shift between the flux of the main winding and the flux of the <b>starting</b> <b>winding,</b> causing the rotor to rotate. When the speed of the motor is sufficient to overcome the inertia of the load, the contacts are opened automatically by a centrifugal switch or electric relay. The direction of rotation is determined by the connection between the main winding and the start circuit. In applications where the motor requires a fixed rotation, one end of the start circuit is permanently connected to the main winding, with the contacts making the connection at the other end.|$|E

50|$|A {{capacitor}} with {{a relatively}} low capacitance, and relatively high voltage rating, is connected in series with the <b>start</b> <b>winding</b> and remains in the circuit during the entire run cycle. Like other split-phase motors, the main winding is used with a smaller <b>start</b> <b>winding,</b> and rotation is changed by reversing {{the connection between the}} main <b>winding</b> and the <b>start</b> circuit. There are significant differences, however; the use of a speed sensitive centrifugal switch requires that other split-phase motors must operate at, or very close to, full speed. PSC motors may operate within a wide range of speeds, much lower than the motor's electrical speed. Also, for applications like automatic door openers that require the motor to reverse rotation often, the use of a mechanism requires that a motor must slow to a near stop before contact with the <b>start</b> <b>winding</b> is re-established. The 'permanent' connection to the capacitor in a PSC motor means that changing rotation is instantaneous.|$|R

The magnitude of capacitor that will develop maximum torque in capacitor start motor and capacitor run motor are investigated and determined by simulation. Each of these capacitors is connected to the auxiliary winding of split-phase motor thereby transforming it into capacitor start or capacitor run motor.

As the main power of robot is provided by wing sail, improving the efficiency of wing sail is the key for its motion.

A single phase induction motor physically looks {{similar to that of}} a three phase induction motor except that its stator is provided with a single phase winding. The rotor of any single phase induction motor is interchangeable with that of a polyphase induction motor. A single phase winding would produce no rotating magnetic field and no starting torque. In the stator of a single phase motor is provided with an extra winding known as <b>starting</b> <b>winding.</b> Single phase induction motors are small motors having a wide field of usefulness where a poly phase supply is not available. They are generally used in fans, blowers, washing machines, refrigerators, etc. The speed of the induction motor can be varied in a narrow range by varying the voltage applied to the stator winding. This method of speed control is suitable for such applications, where the load varies approximately as the square of speed, such as centrifugal pump drives, fan load...|$|E
