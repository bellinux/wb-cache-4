One year later a similar strangely shaped egg was found in the territory of one of the transmitter birds. We used molecular DNA techniques to prove that this egg had been laid by this transmitter female.

50|$|The {{electronics}} can {{be divided}} into four categories: a <b>satellite</b> <b>transmitter</b> used after surfacing, the set of sensors, a time reference clock, and a microprocessor. The clock is essential in locating the float, since it is used as reference to calculate the time travel of the sound signals from the moored emitters. It is also useful to have the float work on schedule. The microprocessor controls all subsystems except the clock, and stores the collected data at a regular schedule. The <b>satellite</b> <b>transmitter</b> is used to send data packages to orbiting satellites after the surfacing. It usually takes three days for the satellite to collect all the dataset.|$|E

40|$|Baudin's cockatoo, Calyptorhynchus baudinii, is a {{threatened}} forest black cockatoo species, endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. In {{this study we}} fitted tail-mounted <b>satellite</b> <b>transmitters</b> to two female Baudin's cockatoos that had undergone treatment and rehabilitation at Perth Zoo and Kaarakin Black Cockatoo Conservation Centre to investigate the feasibility of satellite tracking this species. Both birds were released in Kelmscott, Perth, into an area frequently visited by a flock of wild Baudin's cockatoos. Both telemetry units provided reliable datasets, with one bird moving ∼ 250 km south from the release site. The success of this trial opens the way to address key objectives in the Forest Black Cockatoo Recovery Plan, including: postrelease survival of rehabilitated birds, flock movement, habitat use, and the identification of critical feeding and breeding habitat. Most importantly, it demonstrates that <b>satellite</b> <b>transmitters</b> can be successfully used to locate and track forest black cockatoo species, which are otherwise difficult to monitor...|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} migration {{movements and}} chronology between Northern Pintails (Anas acuta) marked with dorsally mounted <b>satellite</b> <b>transmitters</b> and pintails marked only with tarsus rings. During weekly intervals of spring and autumn migration between their wintering area in Japan and nesting areas in Russia, the mean distance that ringed pintails had migrated {{was up to}} 1000 km farther than the mean distance radiomarked pintails migrated. Radiomarked pintails were detected at spring migration sites on average 9. 9 days (90 % CI 8. 0, 11. 8) later than ringed pintails that were recovered within 50 km. Although ringed and radiomarked pintails departed from Japan on similar dates, the disparity in detection of radiomarked versus ringed pintails at shared sites increased 7. 7 days (90 % CI 5. 2, 10. 2) for each 1000 km increase in distance from Japan. Thus, pintails marked with <b>satellite</b> <b>transmitters</b> arrived at nesting areas that were 2500 km from Japan on average 19 days later than ringed birds. Radiomarked pintails were detected at autumn migration stopovers on average 13. 1 days (90 % CI 9. 8, 16. 4) later than ringed birds that were recovered within 50 km. We hypothesize that dorsal attachment of 12 – 20 g <b>satellite</b> <b>transmitters</b> to Northern Pintails increased the energetic cost of flight, which resulted in more rapid depletion of energetic reserves and shortened the distance pintails could fly without refueling. Radiomarked pintails may have used more stopovers or spent longer periods at stopovers. causing their migration schedule to diverge from ringed pintails. We urge further evaluation {{of the effects of}} dorsally mounted transmitters on migration chronology of waterfowl...|$|R
