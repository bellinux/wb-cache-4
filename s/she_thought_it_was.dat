5|$|Koenig {{first became}} {{involved}} with writing a script for The Animated Series after he asked Susan Sackett, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's assistant, to type up some writing he was working on. After reading it through, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> good and passed it to Roddenberry, who agreed and asked Koenig if {{he was interested in}} writing for the animated show. He accepted the offer, and started working on a plot involving cloning which was inspired by newspaper articles about the subject, becoming the first actor from Star Trek to write for the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Both Wilson {{and critics}} responded {{positively}} to the film, with Wilson saying <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the best film adaptation {{of any of}} her works. It was released on DVD on 12 January 2009. Dustbin Baby was awarded the International Emmy in the Children and Young People category at the 2009 ceremony.

5|$|Richard Vines, whilst {{writing for}} Bloomberg, advised readers {{to not be}} put off the hype; and while the courses are not as life {{changing}} as those served at The Fat Duck, there are stand out dishes such as the meat fruit and the tipsy cake. He {{also noted that the}} meat fruit was a favourite of Pierre Koffmann. Marina O'Loughlin visited the restaurant twice for the Metro newspaper, once just after opening and again several months later to compare how it had settled in. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a well-oiled operation, but a little too much so, and questioned the originality of it as a version of the meat fruit had previously been available at the restaurant Amber in another Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong and little touches as the years of origin which appear next to the menu items have been used before by Marco Pierre White. Jan Moir for The Daily Mail thought that the ice cream trolley was a sensation, along with the meat fruit, but could not understand the reason behind recreating the salamagundy dish.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} opinion, however, of most Islamic scholar {{is that a}} niqab wearer (niqabi), {{in exchange}} for being permitted to wear the niqab and it not being made prohibited, is required only to refrain from criticizing other Muslim women who don't wear the niqab if the other Muslim women cover all their body except for their face (i.e. hijabis). The niqabi is also required to refrain from forcing or propagating her niqab wearing practice upon others, especially against their will. Then, a niqabi shall also not be criticized for her wearing the niqab because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> obligatory, or {{because she had been}} taught it was obligatory, or because she wishes {{to err on the side}} of caution in an incorrect but good faith gesture of extreme modesty.|$|E
25|$|In the anime, a Mr. Mime {{lives with}} Delia Ketchum. He does {{housework}} {{for her in}} exchange for room and board. Ash dressed as a Mr. Mime to inspire a real Mr. Mime who worked for a circus. Delia knew about this, so when a wild Mr. Mime came to her door and wanted lunch, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Ash in costume, and provided it with food. When the real Ash showed up, still in costume, she was quite puzzled, but wound up keeping Mimey as her live-in maid. It will only listen to Delia, and if anyone else, even Ash, gives it orders, or asks it to do something, it will normally ignore them. It is unknown if Delia has actually captured Mimey, as she is never shown with its Poké Ball. When Ash and his friends returned to Pallet Town following the Orange Islands saga, {{it was revealed that}} Brock and Mimey had become rather competitive regarding household tasks while {{the two of them were}} sharing the house with Delia.|$|E

500|$|McCartney and Ono had {{attempted}} to purchase the catalogue in 1981. They were offered the catalogue for £20million ($40million USD) and proposed the pair would each pay £10million. Ono refused as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too high a price. McCartney spoke about the offer {{at a press conference}} in April 1990, explaining that Ono [...] "actually said 'I think we can get it for 5.'

500|$|After leaving Versailles, neither Jourdain nor Moberly {{mentioned}} the incident {{to one another}} until a week later. Moberly wrote a letter about the trip to her sister {{and when she got}} to the afternoon of the Versailles incident, she asked Jourdain if she thought the Petit Trianon was haunted. Jourdain told her that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> Three months later in Oxford, [...] they compared their notes, then decided to write separate accounts of what happened and research the history of the Trianon. In doing so, they found that on 10 August 1792, the Tuileries palace in Paris was besieged, the king's Swiss guards were massacred and the monarchy itself was abolished six weeks later.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, she was {{featured}} partially nude in leading Indian photographer Dabboo Ratnani's annual calendar, {{which is a}} major happening in the Indian glamour industry. According to Daboo, [...] "Her mother saw it much later, after the calendar released. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too sexy, and Riya shouldn't have done it. But {{the response to the}} photograph was superb. Riya was so thrilled that for her next ad campaign, she asked me to light her up like I did in this." [...] A career highlight for the model, it led to a three-year contract with Ratnani to feature her on his annual calendar. She is the only female face to be featured on the calendar for five consecutive years (2003–07).|$|E

500|$|When {{composing}} {{tracks for}} Meet Miley Cyrus, Cyrus was originally very apprehensive {{in regards to}} adding [...] "See You Again" [...] to the album. [...] "I'm not sure about this song. I don't think I {{want to put it}} on the album. I don't really like it that much. It's just O.K.", she said. However, she was convinced to record it and, once she listened to the finished product, she changed her mind. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> odd, but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says [...] "See You Again" [...] is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008).|$|E
500|$|Traister {{chose the}} title Big Girls Don't Cry {{when it was}} {{suggested}} by a friend, before she began writing the book; <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "the perfect ironic reference to Hillary 's (non-)crying moment in New Hampshire", {{as well as a}} reference to her own response of [...] "gulp out sobs" [...] when Clinton lost the Democratic primary. She said that, after interviewing women who described crying at various moments during the election, [...] "I realized that the title was more prophetic than I knew". Some of Traister's political views expressed in the book contradict those she expressed when writing for Salon, such as her support for Clinton and her defense of Michelle Obama in the book; throughout the book she describes the transformations of her opinions.|$|E
500|$|In May 2013, news {{broke that}} Wood had {{opted not to}} renew her {{contract}} with the show to take another break.

500|$|Between series one and two, Wood said <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{a mistake}} to do another As Seen On TV series, and had {{attempted}} to write a play instead: [...] "I've been seeking to branch out, but it hasn't happened. I {{wanted to do something}} different before I went back on TV." [...] However, she soon decided that the play was [...] "too Alan Ayckbourn", threw it away and began writing the second run instead. [...] She aimed to write 18 minutes of script a week. In the end it took six months to complete, an experience she did not enjoy.

500|$|Michelle Erica Green {{reviewed}} the episode for TrekNation, {{and thought that}} Scott Bakula in particular gave {{one of his best}} performances of the show so far. Both he and Carradine worked well together, but thought that the other characters in the flashback were clichéd. Overall, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "superbly filmed episode" [...] with several new sets which were well used, and the visual effects were good. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] gave the episode a score of three out of four, saying that he welcomed the back story to the series being fleshed out in this episode. He thought that the episode itself wasn't very challenging to watch, but thought that the melancholy ending was fitting. He even thought that it might be worthwhile to go further back {{in time to see the}} actual founding of Starfleet.|$|E
500|$|It was {{revealed}} that cast members filmed {{on a number of}} location settings. One of these included an army barracks. They also filmed scenes at Tatenhill Airfield. The airfield's staff had been asked to remain secretive regarding details of the storyline. Lister explained that the episodes were fun to film and they had to do [...] "funny" [...] stunts. Lister was the only cast member out of her, Batley and Kelly who performed the aired skydiving for real. A Hollyoaks producer released two pictures of funeral wreaths, one reading 'Zoe' and the other 'Sarah', in order to confuse viewers further as to whom the victim would be. When the episode aired it played out with Sarah dying in the jump. When executive producer Bryan Kirkwood described the exit to Batley, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "perfect and amazing" [...] end for Sarah. Further adding that [...] "It really draws a line under the four years" [...] of Sarah's storylines.|$|E

500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray {{thought it}} was the best [...] "freak-meet" [...] of the series thus far, [...] as well as one of its best episodes, which he would [...] "eagerly show to Fringe-doubters as {{evidence}} that the series has found its legs." [...] He consequently graded the episode an A−, further attributing the success of the episode to [...] "top-tier" [...] writers Orci and Whedon and [...] "skilled" [...] director Brad Anderson. Murray wrote, [...] "I wouldn't say that 'The Transformation' broke any new ground. If anything, it recapitulated pretty much every previous Fringe element—bio-weapons sales, telepathic communication, Massive Dynamics, [...] airplane crashes, etc.—but did so {{in a way that was}} energetic, tense, and even a little emotional." [...] SFScope columnist Sarah Stegall had difficulty [...] "suspend disbelief" [...] with the science behind Bowman's rapid transformation. Though <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "sweet" [...] that Scott's proposal [...] "echo the real-life recent marriage between Anna Torv and Mark Valley," [...] Stegall was pleased that the series could now move onto another storyline.|$|E
500|$|The episode sees Mark {{reveal that}} he only has 30 minutes before he has to leave for witness protection. He then tries to {{convince}} Kate to come with him. The storyline takes place between 6:30pm and 7:00pm, which is when Neighbours airs in Australia. The episode was filmed over two nights and Gordon told Fox that extra effort went into ensuring the continuity was [...] "perfect." [...] Every minute had to be accounted for, including the commercial breaks and the time {{taken up by the}} actors walking from one house to another. Gordon commented that clocks and watches are used throughout the episode to keep the tension high. During an interview with a Channel 5 website reporter, Brewer said that filming the episode was similar to filming a regular episode of the soap, as the scenes were still shot out of order. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> nice working in a short time period that did not jump from day to day. During the filming of the final scenes on location, the weather took {{a turn for the worse}} and it began to rain. However, Gordon added that it looked [...] "spectacular and adds such an atmosphere." ...|$|E
500|$|Jill L. Lanford {{watched the}} episode for The Herald Journal, {{prior to the}} series premiere. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a resurrection of a [...] "legend". She {{believed}} the episode itself was reminiscent of classic Star Trek episodes [...] "" [...] and [...] "The Squire of Gothos", was the [...] "perfect vehicle to introduce the crew", and a [...] "perfect start". Don Merrill, writing for TV Guide said that the show was a [...] "worthy successor to the original". Bob Niedt reviewed [...] "Encounter at Farpoint" [...] for Newhouse News and thought that the show had potential {{on the back of}} the episode, but there were problems such as [...] "spots where the dialogue is pedestrian and interactions sputter". Tom Shales of The Washington Post viewed DeForest Kelley's cameo as [...] "touching", but thought that Patrick Stewart was a [...] "grim bald crank who would make a better villain". He felt Jonathan Frakes [...] "verges on namby-pamby". Actress Marina Sirtis later recalled the reviews of the show's debut in 1987 while being interviewed to promote The Next Generations fourth film, saying [...] "they bloody hated us".|$|E
