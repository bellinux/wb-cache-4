5|$|S. g. crissalis, (vulnerable) the Lord Howe currawong was {{described}} by English naturalist Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1877. It appears to have adapted well to human habitation on Lord Howe Island, though the population is small overall, <b>somewhere</b> <b>around</b> 70–80 birds. Although regarded as a subspecies, {{it has yet to}} be studied with molecular DNA techniques, which may lead to it being reclassified as a separate species.|$|E

50|$|During this period, Basque {{territory}} extended on {{the west}} up to <b>somewhere</b> undefined <b>around</b> {{the headwaters of the}} Ebro river.

50|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{seems to}} suggest that the Romans only constructed the fort itself <b>somewhere</b> at <b>around</b> 70 AD, whereas a small watchtower might have taken its place in the years before. The construction of Matilo therefore immediately followed the Batavian Rebellion in 69 and as such {{played an important role in}} restoring order to the province of Germania Inferior.|$|R
5|$|The French {{carried out}} seven assaults against the flèches {{and each time}} were beaten back in fierce close combat. Bagration in some {{instances}} was personally leading counterattacks, and in a final attempt to push the French completely back he got hit in the leg by cannonball splinters <b>somewhere</b> <b>around</b> 11:00 hours. He insisted on staying on the field to observe Duka's decisive cavalry attack.|$|E
5|$|Population {{studies from}} {{numerous}} {{areas in the}} world have shown that HHT occurs at roughly the same rate in almost all populations: <b>somewhere</b> <b>around</b> 1 in 5000. In some areas, it is much more common; for instance, in the French region of Haut Jura the rate is 1:2351 - twice as common as in other populations. This has been attributed to a founder effect, in which a population descending from a small number of ancestors has a high rate of a particular genetic trait because one of these ancestors harbored this trait. In Haut Jura, this {{has been shown to be}} the result of a particular ACVRL1 mutation (named c.1112dupG or c.1112_1113insG). The highest rate of HHT is 1:1331, reported in Bonaire and Curaçao, two islands in the Caribbean belonging to the Netherlands Antilles.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel is}} set in Regency England <b>somewhere</b> <b>around</b> 1818, and events are related through third-person narrative. As the story opens, a wealthy, {{beautiful}} and intelligent woman named Annis Wychwood reaches the age of majority. Now having greater control over her personal and financial affairs, Annis decides to move to Bath and live alone, to the displeasure of her brother and his family. Several years later, {{on the way back}} to Bath after a visit to her childhood home, Annis meets Lucilla Carleton and Ninian Elmore. Lucilla is running away to Bath to avoid her marriage to Ninian, a match that her guardian is very much in favour of, and Ninian is escorting her to ensure her safe arrival. Annis volunteers to chaperone Lucilla and notifies the girl's guardian of her plans.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{collimated}} image {{produced by}} the sight is only truly parallax free at infinity, the sight has an error circle equal to {{the diameter of the}} collimating optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind the sight and the closeness of the target this induces some aiming error. For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of the sight) this aiming error is considered trivial. On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle {{in the middle of the}} optical window (sighting down its optical axis). Some manufacturers of small arms sights also make models with the optical collimator set at a finite distance. This gives the sight parallax due to eye movement the size of the optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance (<b>somewhere</b> <b>around</b> a desired target range of 25-50 yards).|$|E
5|$|<b>Somewhere</b> <b>around</b> {{the time}} of the failed {{offensive}} against Moscow in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately. Plans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe—eleven million people—were formalised at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942. Some would be worked to death and the rest would be killed in the implementation of Die Endlösung der Judenfrage (the Final Solution of the Jewish question). Initially the victims were killed with gas vans or by Einsatzgruppen firing squads, but these methods proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. By 1941, killing centres at Auschwitz concentration camp, Sobibor, Treblinka and other Nazi extermination camps replaced Einsatzgruppen as the primary method of mass killing. The total number of Jews murdered during the war is estimated at 5.5 to six million people, including over a million children. Twelve million people were put into forced labour.|$|E
