2500|$|Major Thomas DeWitt Milling was {{assigned}} as officer-in-charge of the Field Officers Course {{at the new}} school and sent to Langley in July 1920 to set it up. War Department General Order No. 18 authorized the school on 14 August 1920. The balloon courses were split off into a separate school in a different area of Langley and the Air Service School was renamed the Air <b>Service</b> <b>Field</b> Officers School on 10 February 1921, after its primary function. The Air Service ordered 17 officers to Langley, eight as students and nine as instructors, although several officers swapped roles and some instructors were students as well. The 1920–1921 class opened on 1 November 1920, and although scheduled to last nine months, was concluded in May when both students and instructors were assigned to the 1st Provisional Air Brigade, as part of [...] by the Air Service and the United States Navy. 11 officers, including four instructors, graduated the first course. The second class, beginning in October 1921, was devoted to the further training of instructors, the creation of a sound administrative system, and development of a well-rounded course curriculum.|$|E
2500|$|Farmland's founder, Howard A. Cowden, {{was born}} in 1893 on a southwestern Missouri farm settled by his grandfather. [...] Unlike other farms in his native Polk County, which {{averaged}} less than 100 acres in size, the Cowden farm at 500 acres {{was one of the}} largest. [...] Cowden believed strongly that farmers were at an economic disadvantage in the marketplace: they faced high interest rates on mortgages, paid high transportation costs, and had virtually no leverage in the pricing of their commodities. [...] He believed that farmers were faced with a [...] "take-it-or-leave-it" [...] proposition. [...] Cowden became active in the organization of agricultural cooperatives and in 1929 formed a new firm, Union Oil Company, which he organized as a cooperative under Missouri statutes. [...] Since Union Oil was intended as a regional enterprise, Cowden elected to establish headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri. [...] By the end of its first year of operation, Union Oil served 22 local cooperatives and was supplied by Kanotex Corporation. [...] Union Oil became the first cooperative in the country to run an oil-compounding plant. [...] With the organization becoming involved {{in a wide range of}} products, it was decided in February 1935 to change the name to [...] "Consumers Cooperative Association" [...] (CCA). [...] CCA had 259 local cooperatives as members and was generating more than $2 million in annual revenues. [...] CCA established a grocery division in 1935 and soon the CO-OP label was applied to over 200 products. [...] To support its petroleum business, CCA built a refinery in Phillipsburg, Kansas. [...] When it became operational in 1939, the facility greatly increased the organization's income and led to a period of prosperity during the 1940s. [...] CCA became involved in a variety of other areas, including the production of flour and feed, the manufacture of household and electrical appliances, and the development of insurance and finance associations. [...] Of particular importance was the feed program, which in its first year generated more revenue than the grocery business did in its tenth year. [...] Another highly profitable business for CAA was fertilizer, which farmers began to use at an accelerated rate. [...] By 1958, CCA topped $100 million in annual revenues, ranked 327th among the Fortune 500, and was one of the largest cooperatives in America. [...] In many ways it was considered an industrial powerhouse, controlling a wide range of assets: oil wells, pipelines, refineries, grease and paint factories, feed mills, fertilizer works, warehouses, and a fleet of trucks. [...] Petroleum products continued to dominate the cooperative's business, accounting for 70 percent of revenues, but that percentage would dip below 50 percent over the next few years as fertilizer became an increasingly more important revenue stream. [...] The emphasis of CCA turned to the farm supply and <b>service</b> <b>field,</b> making the use of the word [...] "consumer" [...] in its title less appropriate. [...] The organization also faced mounting pressure to better serve farmers by engaging in the marketing of agricultural products, an area which CCA had intentionally avoided. [...] In 1958, the CCA Board agreed to become involved in marketing as opportunities might arise. [...] A year later the cooperative purchased the Crawford County Packing Company in Denison, Iowa, and entered the pork processing business, ultimately acquiring food manufacturing facilities throughout the Midwest. [...] During the course of developing its food processing capability, the cooperative sought to improve operating efficiencies, marketing strategies and the relationship with facility employees.|$|E
60|$|As he got {{upon his}} legs, smiling after {{the manner of}} his great exemplar, he held in his hand a small note and a newspaper. 'A comparison,' he said, 'had been instituted between the merits of two gentlemen {{formerly}} {{in the employment of}} the Crown, one of them had been selected for further employment, and the other rejected. The honourable member for Mile End had, he regretted to say, instituted this comparison. They all knew what was the proverbial character of a comparison. It was, however, ready made to his hands, and there was nothing left for him, Mr. Whip Vigil, but to go on with it. This, however, he would do in as light a manner as possible. It had been thought that the one gentleman would not suit the public service, and that the other would do so. It was for him merely to defend this opinion. He now held in his hand a letter written by the protégé of the honourable member for Limehouse; he would not read it--' (cries of 'Read, read!') 'no, he would not read it, but the honourable member might if he would--and could. He himself was prepared to say that a gentleman who chose to express himself in such a style in his private notes--this note, however, was not private in the usual sense--could hardly be expected to command a proper supply of wholesome English, such as the service of the Crown demanded!' Then Mr. Vigil handed across to Mr. Nogo poor Screwy's unfortunate letter about the pork chops. 'As to the other gentleman, whose name was now respectably known in the lighter walks of literature, he would, if permitted, read the opinion expressed as to his style of language by a literary publication of the day; and then the House would see whether or no the produce of the Civil <b>Service</b> <b>field</b> had not been properly winnowed; whether the wheat had not been garnered, and the chaff neglected.' And then the right honourable gentleman read some half-dozen lines, highly eulogistic of Charley's first solitary flight.|$|E
