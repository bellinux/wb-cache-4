Her topics are {{different}} depending on the genre she is writing in; her adult-oriented works often deal with minority groups, while her children's books are meant to teach empathy. Her children's works have won three Adhikarya Awards from the Indonesian Publishers Association, and LGBT groups have praised her novel Gerhana Kembar (Twin Eclipse; 2007) for avoiding stereotyping the group. However, <b>some</b> <b>educators</b> have protested {{the lack of an}} explicit moral message in her children's books.|$|E
25|$|The {{mathematics}} examination in the PSLE {{has faced}} complaints from parents who complain about material outside the syllabus, while facing criticism from <b>some</b> <b>educators</b> from overseas {{who argue that}} the examination eventually encourages rote learning rather than actual conceptual knowledge based on incentives to the student.

25|$|Educators {{have argued}} {{for years about}} which method is best to teach reading to children. For the English language, {{there are two major}} methods, Phonics and Whole Language, within which there are subtypes Synthetic Phonics and Sight word respectively. Each method is {{employed}} at differing rates depending on the country and the specific school division. <b>Some</b> <b>educators</b> are beginning to use the two methods in conjunction to maximize the benefits of both methods.|$|E
25|$|Other changes {{brought in}} by the Harris {{government}} include standardized student tests. These were criticized by <b>some</b> <b>educators</b> as forcing schools to teach in a manner simply oriented to test-passing, and not teach {{in a way to}} encourage genuine learning. Others valued the tests as a means for parents to measure their children's achievement and that of the school against peers. A new provincial funding formula for school boards stripped the local boards of their taxation powers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>educators</b> {{hold the}} view that {{sexuality}} is equated with violence. These educators think that not talking about sexuality will decrease the rate of adolescent sexuality. However, not having access to sexual education {{has been found to}} have negative effects upon students, especially groups such as adolescent girls who come from low-income families. Not receiving appropriate sexual health education increases teenage pregnancy, sexual victimization and high school dropout rates. Researchers state {{that it is important to}} educate students about all aspects of sexuality and sexual health to reduce the risk of these issues.|$|E

25|$|Stated differently, Is {{the goal}} of {{education}} to have children recreate the process of discovery, to learn the products of discovery, or some combination? <b>Some</b> <b>educators</b> have advocated {{a focus on the}} process of discovery without full consideration of the constellation of traits and opportunity that contribute to the creation of secondary knowledge (e.g., Cobb, Yackel, & Wood, 1992). In fact, research on creative-productive individuals suggests that the full constellation of traits that facilitate the discovery and creation of secondary knowledge is rare and not likely reproducible on a large scale (Simonton, 1999a, 1999b, 2003; Sternberg, 1999; Wai, Lubinski, & Benbow, 2005).|$|E
25|$|The Native American {{language}} education {{movement has}} been met with adversity, such as by English-only campaigns in some areas in the late 1990s. However, Navajo-immersion programs have cropped up across the Navajo Nation. Statistical evidence shows that Navajo-immersion students generally do better on standardized tests than their counterparts educated only in English. <b>Some</b> <b>educators</b> have remarked that students who know their native languages {{feel a sense of}} pride and identity validation. Since 1989, Diné College, a Navajo tribal community college, has offered an associate degree in the subject of Navajo. This program includes language, literature, culture, medical terminology, and teaching courses; includes about 600 students per semester; and produces the highest number of Navajo teachers of any institution in the United States. One major university that teaches classes in the Navajo language is Arizona State University. In 1992, Young and Morgan published another major work on Navajo: Analytical Lexicon of Navajo, with the assistance of Sally Midgette (Navajo). This work is organized by root, the basis of Athabaskan languages.|$|E
2500|$|Twentieth-century {{educators}} {{debated the}} value and influence of teaching stories that include brutality and violence, causing {{some of the more}} gruesome details to be sanitized. Dégh writes that <b>some</b> <b>educators</b> believe that children should be shielded from cruelty of any form; that stories with a happy ending are fine to teach, whereas those that are darker, particularly the legends, might pose more harm. On the other hand, <b>some</b> <b>educators</b> and psychologists believe that children easily discern the difference between what is a story and what is not and that the tales continue to have value for children. The publication of Bruno Bettelheim's 1976 The Uses of Enchantment brought a new wave of interest in the stories as children's literature, with an emphasis on the [...] "therapeutic value for children". More popular stories such as [...] "Hansel and Gretel" [...] and [...] "Little Red Riding Hood" [...] have become staples of modern childhood, presented in coloring books, puppet shows, and cartoons. Other stories, however, have been considered too gruesome and have not made a popular transition.|$|E

2500|$|Role-playing {{games are}} {{substantially}} different from competitive games such as ball games and card games. [...] This {{has led to}} confusion among some non-players {{about the nature of}} fantasy gaming. [...] The game Dungeons & Dragons was a subject of controversy in the 1980s when well-publicized opponents claimed it caused negative spiritual and psychological effects. [...] Academic research has discredited these claims. [...] <b>Some</b> <b>educators</b> support role-playing games as a healthy way to hone reading and arithmetic skills. [...] Though role-playing has been accepted by some, a few religious organizations continue to object.|$|E

Jack Montgomery questioned why state highway funding for Bossier and, particularly, Webster Parish lagged behind other parishes in the region. In a newspaper advertisement, he cited a study which ranked Bossier in 14th place and Webster in 20th place among the twenty-three parishes of north Louisiana in highway appropriations. <b>Some</b> <b>educators</b> rallied behind Harold Montgomery in an advertisement claiming to [...] "Keep Good Government." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, <b>some</b> <b>educators</b> in the United States {{began to}} {{question}} the impact of rankings on the college admissions process, {{due in part to}} the 11 March 2007 The Washington Post article [...] "The Cost of Bucking College Rankings" [...] by Dr. Michele Tolela Myers, a former president of Sarah Lawrence College. As Sarah Lawrence College dropped its SAT test score submission requirement for its undergraduate applicants in 2003, thus joining the SAT optional movement for undergraduate admission, SLC does not have SAT data to send to U.S. News for its national survey. Of this decision, Myers states, [...] "We are a writing-intensive school, and the information produced by SAT scores added little to our ability to predict how a student would do at our college; it did, however, do much to bias admission in favor of those who could afford expensive coaching sessions." [...] At present, Sarah Lawrence is the only American college that completely disregards SAT scores in its admission process. [...] As a result of this policy, in the same The Washington Post article, Dr. Myers stated that she was informed by the U.S. News & World Report that if no SAT scores were submitted, U.S. News would [...] "make up a number" [...] to use in its magazines. She further argues that if SLC were to decide to stop sending all data to U.S. News & World Report, their ranking would be artificially decreased.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem solving}} {{approach}} to teaching has long been promoted as the most effective method for teaching agriculture in the secondary schools.
