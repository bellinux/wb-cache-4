40|$|The {{consumption}} of animal by-products {{has continued to}} witness tremendous growth over the last decade. This is due to its potential to combat protein malnutrition and food insecurity in many countries. Shortly after <b>slaughter,</b> <b>animal</b> by-products are separated into edible or inedible parts. The edible part accounts for 55 % of the production while the remaining part is regarded as inedible by-products (IEBPs). These IEBPs can be re-processed into sustainable products for agricultural and industrial uses. The efficient utilization of animal by-products can alleviate the prevailing cost and scarcity of feed materials, which have high competition between animals and humans. This will also aid in reducing environmental pollution in the society. In this regard, proper utilization of animal by-products such as rumen digesta can result in cheaper feed, reduction in competition and lower cost of production. Over the years, the utilization of animal by-products such as rumen digesta as feed in livestock feed has been successfully carried out without any adverse effect on the animals. However, there are emerging gaps {{that need to be}} further addressed regarding the food security and sustainability of the products. Therefore, the objective of this review highlights the efficacy and effectiveness of using animal by-products as alternative sources of feed ingredients, and the constraints associated with their production to boost livestock performance in the industry at large...|$|E

40|$|The {{historical}} {{relationship between}} veterinary {{medicine and the}} government regulation of its interests is extensive. The foremost example of this was {{the establishment of the}} United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 1862, and the subsequent elevation of the agency to cabinet status in 1889. The Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) was founded as an office within the USDA in 1884, and Daniel Salmon, a Cornell-trained veterinarian, was its first chief. The BAI eventually became what we know as the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and Agricultural Research Service. These early examples of federal agencies geared toward animals and agriculture demonstrate the long-standing association between animals, their caretakers, and the federal government. As the nation grew, so, too, did the scope of veterinary medicine. In recent years, legislation regarding horse <b>slaughter,</b> <b>animal</b> ownership, veterinary debt foregiveness, and bioterror preparedness has been debated inside congressional walls. These issues have also been taken on by various lobbies, including the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges, the Humane Society of the United States, and others. The interests of the government and these lobbies may, at various times, coincide or collide; either way, the issues raised present opportunities for professional groups to work with policy-makers for health and welfare reform. The paper examines the author's role in pursuing passage of the Captive Primate Safety Act, a federal measure with animal health, public health, and animal welfare implications. The author lobbied for the bill while externing at the AVMA's Governmental Relation's Division (AVMA-GRD), the advocacy arm of that association. The paper discusses why this bill is relevant to veterinary medicine, and how the author approached the Senate to help elevate the bill into law.

There have been monitoring in the years 2011 - 2014 these indicators and inter-annual results: bulls housed an average of 293 pieces, increases amounted to an average of 35580, 76 kilograms in total, concentrated feed consumption averaged 2, 66 kg per ks. den- 1, concentrated feed consumption was of average 94667 kg total, average growth per day feeding 0, 99 kg, feed consumption per kg of growth reached an average of 2, 89 kg, an average of 94 bulls were sent to slaughter, with a total weight of 58, 987 kg and the average slaughter weight amounted to 633, 2 kg. Finally, evaluate the effect weight was 266 bulls for carcass quality, the average slaughter weight amounted to 715, 4 kg. As an indicator was chosen carcase weight, which amounted an average of 401, 9 kg. Furthermore, the average daily gain these monitored bulls amounted 0, 985 kg, and the average age at slaughter was 23 months. Another indicator of the level of conformation, which assigned a point value system amounted 3, 42. The degree of fat cover, which in the allotted scoring average value amounted 2, 12.

To evaluate the influence of slaughter weight of bulls on selected indicators of meat production was observed positive effect of increasing slaughter weight of bulls for carcass weight and conformation level carcasses. Fat cover of carcases different slaughter weights were not negatively affected. An interesting finding was a higher average daily gain of bulls slaughtered at higher weights. This indicates good genetic potential of animals on its suitability for fattening to slaughter weight higher, while achieving higher quality carcass (SEUROP favorable classification system and the higher financial profit for <b>slaughter</b> <b>animal).</b> In the company will still need to optimize ration, mainly to enhance the quality roughage feed...|$|E
40|$|Improving cow herd {{efficiency}} is critical because approximately 70 % of the feed inputs {{required to produce}} a <b>slaughter</b> <b>animal</b> are used for maintenance, the majority of which is utilized by the dam (Williams and Jenkins, 2006). To date, much of the efforts to improve efficiency in cattle have focused on different measures of feed efficiency (variations in amount of feed consumed and rate of weight gain) determined during the growing phase. While this approach provides pertinent information concerning efficiency during the growing phase, the relationship to cow efficiency remains to be determined. When considering the usefulness of feed efficiency {{as an indicator of}} cow efficiency, it is important to assess the specific approach used to determine feed efficiency and compare the input and outputs that contribute to efficiency during the different phases of production. In cows, the most critical factor influencing output component of {{efficiency is}} lifetime reproductive rate, not weight gain. Lifetime reproductive rate is a cumulative process and may require years to establish which has limited efforts to identify processes contributing to variation in output among individual animals. Furthermore, nutrition and management components of cow-calf production in range environments are more complex and subject to greater seasonal and annual variation than in confined settings where harvested feeds of relatively homogeneous quality are typical of the feedlot phase of production, and while technology exists to measure feed intake of individual animals in a feedlot setting, methods are not available for quantifying feed intake under grazing conditions. The wide variations in environmental and management conditions existing in cow-calf production contribute to the challenge of establishing genetic components of efficiency universal for all cows and likely impart the need to match different genetic types to different production environments. Matching cow type to production environment is becoming increasingly more important due to rising costs of providing supplement feed when production potential exceeds nutrient availability. Increasing cost associated with providing supplemental feed to the cow herd may lead to greater distinctions between biological and economic efficiency in the cow-calf phase compared to other segments. For example, cows that consume more calories during the vegetation growing season and gain sufficient weight to exist on less harvested feed inputs during winter may require less total economic input than cows with greater potential for feed conversion that consume less during the growing season, but require more calories from harvested feed later. Efficiency of beef cattle production requires a balance between amount and cost of nutritional inputs with prolonged optimal output. A provocative question to consider is whether traditional approaches of providing sufficient feed to a herd of cows to achieve a relatively high rate of reproduction results in improved efficiency or not? Is this analogous to selecting a type of cattle and managing the environment to sustain the type...|$|E

40|$|Mycobacterium bovis is {{the major}} causative agent of bovine {{tuberculosis}} (BTB) {{and part of the}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). BTB can {{have an impact on the}} national and international economy, affects the ecosystem via transmission to wildlife and is of public health concern due to its zoonotic potential. Although still present in some industrialized countries, BTB today mostly affects developing countries lacking the resources to apply expensive test and slaughter schemes. In Africa, the disease is present virtually on the whole continent; however, little accurate information on its distribution and prevalence is available. Evaluations of antemortem tests for the diagnosis of BTB in Africa are scarce but a prerequisite to identify appropriate tools for future disease control programs. Spoligotyping and variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) typing of M. bovis strains isolated from cattle in the UK has revealed the predominance of a single clonal complex of strains with subtypes of the complex being geographically localized to specific regions within the country. Spoligotype patterns of strains isolated from cattle from several countries throughout the world have been reported in a number of recent studies and the construction of databases (www. Mbovis. org, SPOLDB 4) has facilitated their comparison and helped elucidate the distribution of specific strain families. In an attempt to gain insights into the population structure of M. bovis in Africa, we have isolated strains of M. bovis from cattle carcasses with gross visible lesions at abattoirs in Dakar (Senegal), Bamako (Mali), Sarh (Chad), Morogoro (Tanzania), Algiers (Algeria) and Blida (Algeria). These mycobacteria were subjected to spoligotyping and VNTR typing. A specific region of difference, which we have named RDAf 1, was previously found to be absent in strains from Chad and presence of this deletion was assessed in our strain collection by PCR. In collaboration with others, additional strains of M. bovis from other African countries were subjected to molecular typing. At the abattoir of Sarh in Chad, 954 cattle were subjected to single intra-dermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) testing and two recently developed fluorescence polarization assays (FPA) prior to <b>slaughter.</b> <b>Animal</b> carcasses underwent standard meat inspection. Gross visible lesions were extracted, analyzed by microscopy and cultured. Cultured acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were further characterized by molecular techniques. The different diagnostic tests were evaluated using a sub-population of animals with either a PCR confirmed MTBC infection or no visible lesions. In addition, a Bayesian model for the evaluation of multiple diagnostic tests in the absence of a gold standard method was developed. In collaboration with others, we have identified a clonal complex of strains of M. bovis present at high frequency in cattle in population samples from Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria and Mali. This closely related group of bacteria is defined by the RDAf 1 chromosomal deletion and can be identified by the absence of spacer 30 in its spoligotype pattern. We have named this group of strains the Bovis African 1 (Af 1) clonal complex. Strains of the Af 1 clonal complex were not detected in population samples from other regions in Africa or other parts of the world, suggesting that the Af 1 clonal complex is geographically localized to sub-Saharan West-Central Africa. VNTR typing allowed to distinguish sub-populations of the Af 1 clonal complex, which were geographically localized to different countries. This was an unexpected result suggesting that the movement of strains between countries is not common in this area. In Mali, in addition to Af 1, a second clonal group of M. bovis has been detected and matching VNTR patterns for some of its strains and strains from France could indicate a French origin. In Tanzania, also two clonal complexes of M. bovis were detected by spoligotyping with one clade showing a link to strains, previously identified in Uganda and Ethiopia and the second clade showing a link to strains previously isolated in South Africa. M. bovis strains isolated from Algerian cattle were closely related to strains from continental Europe and especially France. In conclusion, our work has revealed important insights into the population structure of M. bovis in Africa and suggests the presence of distinct clonal complexes of strains, geographically localized to specific areas of the continent. Our Bayesian model estimated the true BTB prevalence amongst the slaughterhouse cattle population in Sarh, Chad to be at 8...|$|E
