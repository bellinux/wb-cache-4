40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{proposes a}} method for the {{organization}} of real <b>sliding</b> <b>movements,</b> which are caused by finite switching frequency of control systems. In one of two proposed structures for the organization of sliding modes, the control is formed according {{to the principle of}} feedback connections; in the other proposed structure, the control is formed according to the principle of discrete control where the discrete levels are defined by crossing (hitting) points on a hyperplane. The proposed method allows users to solve practically oriented problems of organization of <b>sliding</b> <b>movements</b> while taking into account real boundaries existing in systems. The proposed models are simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK...|$|R

60|$|There {{were five}} {{families}} of these players and, forbidden before the Revolution {{to perform in}} public, they had received grants of land or salaries from the state. The white and purple curtain was no doubt to hang upon a wall behind the players or over their entrance door for the Noh stage is a platform surrounded upon three sides by the audience. No 'naturalistic' effect is sought. The players wear masks and found their movements upon those of puppets: {{the most famous of}} all Japanese dramatists composed entirely for puppets. A swift or a slow movement and a long or a short stillness, and then another movement. They sing as much as they speak, and there is a chorus which describes the scene and interprets their thought and never becomes as in the Greek theatre a part of the action. At the climax instead of the disordered passion of nature there is a dance, a series of positions & movements which may represent a battle, or a marriage, or the pain of a ghost in the Buddhist purgatory. I have lately studied certain of these dances, with Japanese players, and I notice that their ideal of beauty, unlike that of Greece and like that of pictures from Japan and China, makes them pause at moments of muscular tension. The interest is not in the human form but in the rhythm to which it moves, and the triumph of their art is to express the rhythm in its intensity. There are few swaying movements of arms or body such as make the beauty of our dancing. They move from the hip, keeping constantly the upper part of their body still, and seem to associate with every gesture or pose some definite thought. They cross the stage with a <b>sliding</b> <b>movement,</b> and one gets the impression not of undulation but of continuous straight lines.|$|E
60|$|When a tall stick {{was placed}} {{so as to}} arrest the lower and rigid internodes of the Ceropegia, at the {{distance}} at first of 15 and then of 21 inches from the centre of revolution, the straight shoot slowly and gradually slid up the stick, so as to {{become more and more}} highly inclined, but did not pass over the summit. Then, after an interval sufficient to have allowed of a semi-revolution, the shoot suddenly bounded from the stick and fell over to the opposite side or point of the compass, and reassumed its previous slight inclination. It now recommenced revolving in its usual course, so that after a semi- revolution it again came into contact with the stick, again slid up it, and again bounded from it and fell over to the opposite side. This movement of the shoot had a very odd appearance, as if it were disgusted with its failure but was resolved to try again. We shall, I think, understand this movement by considering the former illustration of the sapling, in which the growing surface was supposed to creep round from the northern by the western to the southern face; and thence back again by the eastern to the northern face, successively bowing the sapling in all directions. Now with the Ceropegia, the stick being placed to the south of the shoot and in contact with it, as soon as the circulatory growth reached the western surface, no effect would be produced, except that the shoot would be pressed firmly against the stick. But as soon as growth on the southern surface began, the shoot would be slowly dragged with a <b>sliding</b> <b>movement</b> up the stick; and then, as soon as the eastern growth commenced, the shoot would be drawn from the stick, and its weight coinciding with the effects of the changed surface of growth, would cause it suddenly to fall to the opposite side, reassuming its previous slight inclination; and the ordinary revolving movement would then go on as before. I have described this curious case with some care, because it first led me to understand the order in which, as I then thought, the surfaces contracted; but in which, as we now know from Sachs and II. de Vries, they grow for a time rapidly, thus causing the shoot to bow towards the opposite side.|$|E

40|$|After obtaining full-coverage swath {{bathymetry}} data in 1995 {{and very}} high-resolution acoustic profiles in 2002, four slides at the Balearic Margin of the Eivissa Channel {{in the western}} Mediterranean Sea were revisited in 2004 when side-scan sonar data were collected using a MAK- 1 M deep-towed acoustic system. These new findings, higher in resolution than those for the swath bathymetry, show two main features previously undetected within these submarine landslides: (1) a series of step-forming inclined and detached slabs oriented perpendicular to the <b>slide</b> <b>movement</b> and located in the uppermost part of the slides, and (2) arcuate regular positive ridges oriented also normal to the <b>slide</b> <b>movement</b> and located in the depositional lobes {{of some of the}} slides. The former are interpreted as extensional ridges, suggesting a retrogressive post-failure evolution of the slides. The latter are interpreted as compression ridges, related to plastic deformation of the sediment before movement freezing. Moreover, the new data show that fluid escape features are even more widespread in the Eivissa Channel than previously thought, dozens of new pockmarks less than 20 m in diameter having been identified. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{next step}} up from the simple nut is a split nut, whose halves can be {{adjusted}} and locked with screws so that one side rides leftward thread faces, {{and the other side}} rides rightward faces. Notice the analogy here with the radio dial example using split gears, where the split halves are pushed in opposing directions. Unlike in the radio dial example, the spring tension idea is not useful here, because machine tools taking a cut put too much force against the screw. Any spring light enough to allow <b>slide</b> <b>movement</b> at all would allow cutter chatter at best and <b>slide</b> <b>movement</b> at worst. These screw-adjusted split-nut-on-an-Acme-leadscrew designs cannot eliminate all backlash on a machine slide unless they are adjusted so tight that the travel starts to bind. Therefore, this idea can't totally obviate the always-approach-from-the-same-direction concept; but backlash can be held to a small amount (1 or 2 thousandths of an inch), which is more convenient and in some non-precise work is enough to allow one to ignore the backlash (i.e., act as if there weren't any).|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} interest {{exists in}} measuring the thermal emissivity of building surfaces since high values combined with high solar reflectance allow rejecting solar energy absorbed by irradiated surfaces, whereas intermediate or low values permit to limit condensation of humidity, heat {{loss to the}} sky, or heat transfer through airspaces. The most used measurement method is probably that described by the ASTM C 1371 Standard, which correlates the thermal emissivity to the radiative heat flux exchanged in the infrared between the sample surface, kept at ambient temperature, and the bottom surface of a hot emissometer head. With samples showing a low thermal conductivity, the 'slide method' modification is generally used: the hot head is allowed to slide above the sample {{in order to prevent}} this from warming up. The <b>slide</b> <b>movement,</b> however, is carried out by hand and time is needed to achieve a stabilized output, therefore the measurement may be time-consuming and also affected by the operator. In order to solve both problems, an automated approach is proposed here, in which the head is moved by the arm of a robot. This manages either the <b>slide</b> <b>movement</b> or the calibration with reference samples, interacting with a computerized data acquisition system that monitors the emissometer output...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the movement of}} an actin filament sliding on a mixture of normal and genetically modified myosin molecules that were attached to a glass surface. For this purpose, we used a Dictyostelium G 680 V mutant myosin II whose release rates of Pi and ADP were highly suppressed relative to normal myosin, leading to a significantly extended life-time of the strongly bound state with actin and virtually no motility. When the mixing ratio of G 680 V mutant myosin II to skeletal muscle HMM (heavy myosin) was 0. 01 %, the actin filaments moved intermittently. When they moved, their sliding velocities were about two-fold faster than the velocity of skeletal HMM alone. Furthermore, <b>sliding</b> <b>movements</b> were also faster when the actin filaments were allowed to slide on skeletal muscle HMM-coated glass surfaces in the motility buffer solution containing G 680 V HMM. In this case no intermittent movement was observed. When the actin filaments used were copolymerized with a fusion protein consisting of Dictyostelium actin and Dictyostelium G 680 V myosin II motor domain, similar faster <b>sliding</b> <b>movements</b> were observed on skeletal muscle HMM-coated surfaces. The filament sliding velocities were about two-fold greater than the velocities of normal actin filaments. We found that the velocity of actin filaments sliding on skeletal muscle myosin molecules increased {{in the presence of}} a non-motile G 680 V mutant myosin motor...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{fluctuation}} in the translational <b>sliding</b> <b>movement</b> of microtubules driven by kinesin in a motility assay in vitro. By calculating the mean-square displacement {{deviation from the}} average {{as a function of}} time, we obtained motional diffusion coefficients for microtubules and analyzed the dependence of the coefficients on microtubule length. Our analyses suggest that 1) the motional diffusion coefficient consists of the sum of two terms, one that is proportional to the inverse of the microtubule length (as the longitudinal diffusion coefficient of a filament in Brownian movement is) and another that is independent of the length, and 2) the length-dependent term decreases with increasing kinesin concentration. This latter term almost vanishes within the length range we studied at high kinesin concentrations. From the length-dependence relationship, we evaluated the friction coefficient for sliding microtubules. This value is much larger than the solvent friction and thus consistent with protein friction. The length independence of the motional diffusion coefficient observed at sufficiently high kinesin concentrations indicates the presence of correlation in the <b>sliding</b> <b>movement</b> fluctuation. This places significant constraint on the possible mechanisms of the <b>sliding</b> <b>movement</b> generation by kinesin motors in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{dark-field}} microscope {{equipped with a}} high-efficiency TV camera including a video tape-recorder, we recorded the <b>sliding</b> <b>movement</b> between outer doublet microtubules of the demembranated axonemes of sea-urchin (Pseudocentrotus depressus and Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus) sperm flagella by adding ATP and trypsin at 25 °C. The time and length of the sliding doublet microtubules from axonemes were measured directly from {{the image on the}} picture monitor from the video tape. The sliding velocity was almost constant in the range from o to 2 % polyethylene glycol concentration in the reactivation medium and decreased a little at more than 2 %. We prepared various lengths of axoneme fragments by homogenizing whole axonemes and found that the shorter fragments showed similar sliding velocity to that of longer ones at less than 200 fiM ATP, but slightly decreased speed at more than 500 fiM ATP. The <b>sliding</b> <b>movement</b> sometimes stopped and the percentage of sliding axonemes was lower below 2 fig/ml trypsin. Above 3 /ig/ml, the process appeared to be more like disintegration than <b>sliding</b> <b>movement,</b> which may be due to excess digestion by trypsin. Sliding speed was therefore measured in a reactivation medium containing 2 % polyethylene glycol with the addition of ATP and 2 /tg/ml trypsin. The velocity increased in proportion to the increase in ATP concentration. VmMI was approximately 14 /im/s at 1 mM ATP. In order to compare the Km for the sliding velocity with that of the ATPase activity of the axonemes, we measured ATPase activity of axonemes prepared and assayed under conditions in which <b>sliding</b> <b>movement</b> in the axonemes could be induced. Neither the curve of ATPase activity nor the curve of sliding velocity plotted against ATP concentration obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The close relationship between ATPase activity and sliding velocity suggested that ' sliding-movement-coupled ATPase activity ' may well be reflected in the axoneme ATPase reported here...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{recently}} developed in vitro motility assay, we {{have demonstrated that}} local anesthetics directly inhibit myosin-based movement of single actin filaments in a reversible dose-dependent manner. This is the first reported account {{of the actions of}} local anesthetics on purified proteins at the molecular level. In this study, two tertiary amine local anesthetics, lidocaine and tetracaine, were used. The inhibitory action of the local anesthetics on actomyosin <b>sliding</b> <b>movement</b> was pH dependent; the anesthetics were more potent at higher pH values, and this reaction was accompanied by an increased proportion of the uncharged form of the anesthetics. QX- 314, a permanently charged derivative of lidocaine, had no effect on actomyosin <b>sliding</b> <b>movement.</b> These results indicate that the uncharged form of local anesthetics is predominantly responsible for the inhibition of actomyosin <b>sliding</b> <b>movement.</b> The local anesthetics inhibited <b>sliding</b> <b>movement</b> but hardly interfered with the binding of actin filaments to myosin on the surface or with actomyosin ATPase activity at low ionic strength. To characterize the actomyosin interaction in the presence of anesthetics, we measured the binding and breaking force of the actomyosin complex. The binding of actin filaments to myosin on the surface was not affected by lidocaine at low ionic strength. The breaking force, measured using optical tweezers, was approximately 1. 5 pN per micron of an actin filament, which was much smaller than in rigor and isometric force. The binding and breaking force greatly decreased with increasing ionic strength, indicating that the remaining interaction is ionic in nature. The result suggests that the binding and ATPase of actomyosin are governed predominantly by ionic interaction, which is hardly affected by anesthetics; whereas the force generation requires hydrophobic interaction, which plays {{a major part of the}} strong binding and is blocked by anesthetics, in addition to the ionic interaction...|$|E
