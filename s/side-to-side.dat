5|$|After {{the initial}} {{sequence}} of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed. Deformation typically occurs {{as a result}} of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or <b>side-to-side</b> (strike-slip) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.|$|E
5|$|Blacknose {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger sharks, and captives have been {{observed}} to perform an apparent threat display towards encroaching divers or newly introduced members of their species. The display consists of the shark hunching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, gaping its jaws, and swimming with an exaggerated <b>side-to-side</b> motion. Known parasites of this species include the copepods Nesippus orientalis, Perissopus dentatus, Pandarus sinuatus, Kroyeria sphyrnae, Nemesis atlantica, and Eudactylina spinifera, as well as tapeworms in the genera Paraorygmatobothrium and Platybothrium.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{cross-country}} skiing {{is similar to}} the original form of skiing, from which all skiing disciplines evolved, including alpine skiing, ski jumping and Telemark skiing. Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward (classic style) or <b>side-to-side</b> in a skating motion (skate skiing), aided by arms pushing on ski poles against the snow. It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes, including Northern Europe, Canada, Russia and regions in the United States.|$|E
5|$|New Guinea {{crocodiles}} have {{a mostly}} aquatic lifestyle and are largely nocturnal. They {{spend much of}} the day underwater, often with their nostrils and eyes above the surface. Powerful <b>side-to-side</b> movements of their tails propel them through the water and they use both tail and legs to steer. When on land, they favour shady, dense areas of undergrowth. They tend to bask in a group during the day, dispersing at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists have {{proposed}} {{many ways in}} which the sail could have functioned in life. Some of the first to think about its purpose suggested that the sail may have served as camouflage among reeds while Dimetrodon waited for prey, or as an actual boat-like sail to catch the wind while the animal was in the water. Another is that the long neural spines could have stabilized the trunk by restricting up-and-down movement, which would allow for a more efficient <b>side-to-side</b> movement while walking.|$|E
5|$|Pilot {{control was}} entirely through a single side-mounted control stick. Pitch and roll were {{controlled}} through conventional fore-aft and <b>side-to-side</b> motions, while yaw {{could be controlled}} by twisting the stick. No mechanical linkages were used, the stick instead controlled the flow of high pressure air around the craft, which either directly attached to various control surfaces, or indirectly through local cable linkages to replace controls that were intended to be cable-actuated (like throttle controls on the engines).|$|E
5|$|The Pipeline Authorization Act {{required}} the pipeline {{to be able}} to withstand the maximum earthquake ever recorded in the area it was built. When crossing the Denali Fault, Teflon-coated sliders were designed to allow the pipeline to move <b>side-to-side</b> in an earthquake. To protect against forward-and-backward shocks and to allow for thermal expansion, the pipeline wasn't designed as a straight line. Instead, it was intended to be laid in an S-shape, and the bends would allow for expansion and movement without breaking.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{equations}} {{of motion}} can be linearized, a bike is a nonlinear system. The variable(s) to be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum of the behaviors of its descriptors. Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which friction and any flexing is ignored, a bike is a conservative system. Damping, however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, <b>side-to-side</b> oscillations will decrease with time. Energy added with a sideways jolt to a bike running straight and upright (demonstrating self-stability) is converted into increased forward speed, not lost, as the oscillations die out.|$|E
5|$|Inferences about {{behavior}} {{can also be}} drawn from examination of the inner ear. The semicircular canals within the inner ear aid in balance, and the lateral semicircular canal is usually {{parallel to the ground}} when the animal holds its head in an alert posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal is parallel to the ground, the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position. The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to <b>side-to-side</b> motions of the head.|$|E
5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground through the side window. Such <b>side-to-side</b> head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{match was}} a singles match between Kane versus Impostor Kane. The match began with Impostor Kane {{executing}} a sidewalk slam on Kane, a move {{in which a}} wrestler stands <b>side-to-side</b> and slightly behind with the opponent, and reaches around the opponent's torso with his near arm across the opponent's chest and under both arms and places the other arm under the victim's legs. The Impostor tried to grab and lift Kane by the throat and slam him down into the mat, termed as a chokeslam, but Kane countered with driving Impostor Kane's head onto the wrestling mat. The match concluded with Impostor Kane performing a chokeslam on Kane and pinning him for the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{great white}} shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower lobes on the tail fin are {{approximately}} the same size {{which is similar to}} some mackerel sharks. A great white displays countershading, by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes in a brown or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance. The coloration makes it difficult for prey to spot the shark because it breaks up the shark's outline when seen from the side. From above, the darker shade blends with the sea and from below it exposes a minimal silhouette against the sunlight. Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of serrated teeth behind the main ones, ready to replace any that break off. When the shark bites, it shakes its head <b>side-to-side,</b> helping the teeth saw off large chunks of flesh.|$|E
5|$|The toothcomb of most lemuriforms {{includes}} six finely spaced teeth, four incisors and two canine {{teeth that}} are procumbent (tilt forward) {{in the front}} of the mouth. The procumbent lower canine teeth are the same shape as the incisors located between them, but they are more robust and curve upward and inward, more so than the incisors. In the permanent dentition, the canines erupt after the incisors. The crowns of the incisors are also angled in the direction of the forward tilt, and the crowns of both the incisors and canines are elongated and compressed <b>side-to-side.</b> The apical ridge, following along the front edges of the toothcomb teeth, is V-shaped in most lemuriforms, tapering off from the midline. As a result of this dental reconfiguration, the upper and lower incisors do not contact one another, and often the upper incisors are reduced or lost completely.|$|E
5|$|As an {{adaptation}} for navigating its complex reef environment, the epaulette shark moves by seemingly walking, bending its body from <b>side-to-side</b> and pushing {{off of the}} substrate with its paddle-shaped pectoral and pelvic fins. Its gait {{is similar to that}} of salamanders, an example of convergent evolution. The shark is capable of swimming, but often prefers to walk along the sandy or coral bottom even when the water is deep enough to allow it to swim freely. The cartilaginous supports of the epaulette shark's paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks, allowing them to be rotated for use as limbs. This mode of locomotion even enables the shark to crawl out of the water to access isolated tidal pools. The gait of the epaulette shark is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders, suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate, and facilitated the evolution of, the first terrestrial vertebrates. Epaulette sharks are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water. They often hide inside or below coral heads, though it is enough for the head to be covered even if the rest of the body is exposed. Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current, a form of orientation known as rheotaxis that may improve respiration or predator awareness.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are herbivores, grazing {{mainly on}} grasses and aquatic plants, {{as well as}} fruit and tree bark. They are very {{selective}} feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it. They eat {{a greater variety of}} plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season. Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so are not consumed at that time. The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than <b>side-to-side.</b> Capybaras are autocoprophagous, meaning they eat their own feces as a source of bacterial gut flora, to help digest the cellulose in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by cattle. As is the case with other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses; their cheek teeth also grow continuously.|$|E
5|$|Scutes {{from the}} postcranial {{region of the}} {{skeleton}} are also known from struthiosaurines. Cervical bands have been found on S. austriacus, as well as S. sp.. The cervical bands are preserved as a groups {{of two or three}} osteoderms that are fused with a large neural spine on the medial edge, and attached to each other through small ovular scutes with short rounded peaks. The scute attaching to the neural spine has a round ridge with a shallow depression ovular in shape. One band was preserved with a primary osteoderm that was angled across the neck from <b>side-to-side</b> and was as long as the whole band itself. The base of the scute is rounded and ends with a tapered point, and the upper side of the scute has a smooth, lightly arching shape. Other bands are preserved with a triangular osteoderms with flat tops and rounded bottoms. The exact placement of cervical bands is not known. In 1995, Pereda-Suberbiola et al. suggested that in a more traditional placement, the bands would have been horizontal along the body, with the neural spine {{in the middle of the}} back. That positioning would mean that the medial scute would be next to another osteoderm of equal size, and together they would either fuse, like in Edmontonia, or touch, as in Sauropelta. Another possibility, suggested by Ford, was that the bands were along the side of the neck, pointing dorsally. If oriented along the side, the primary scutes would have pointed up and down, like in polacanthids, and the medial scutes would, by definition, become secondary osteoderms. The set of medial scutes (or secondary) would be possibly oval in shape.|$|E
25|$|The chewing action differs in that undisputed crown mammals chew with a <b>side-to-side</b> {{grinding}} action, {{which means}} that the molars usually occlude on only one side at a time, while multituberculates' jaws were incapable of <b>side-to-side</b> movement—they chewed, rather, by dragging the lower teeth backwards against the upper ones as the jaw closed.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{the film}} was {{released}} alongside the 1978 animated film The Water Babies as a <b>Side-to-Side</b> VHS.|$|E
25|$|<b>Side-to-side</b> {{movement}} is {{kept to a}} minimum: {{one of the main}} functions of the leg kick is to maintain the line of the body.|$|E
25|$|Farlow {{and others}} studied tyrannosaur tooth biomechanics, finding {{them to be}} more {{resistant}} to forces in both the front-to-back and <b>side-to-side</b> planes than the more blade-like teeth of other carnivorous dinosaurs.|$|E
25|$|The four {{extrinsic}} muscles {{originate from}} bone and {{extend to the}} tongue. They are the genioglossus, the hyoglossus (often including the chondroglossus) the styloglossus, and the palatoglossus. Their main functions are altering the tongue's position allowing for protrusion, retraction, and <b>side-to-side</b> movement.|$|E
25|$|After {{the initial}} {{sequence}} of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed. Deformation typically occurs {{as a result}} of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or <b>side-to-side</b> (strike-slip) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.|$|E
25|$|Suspension bridges {{may respond}} to {{earthquakes}} with a <b>side-to-side</b> motion exceeding {{that which was}} designed for wind gust response. Such motion can cause fragmentation of the road surface, damage to bearings, and plastic deformation or breakage of components. Devices such as hydraulic dampers or clamped sliding connections and additional diagonal reenforcement may be added.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from having}} a flat, nodal skull, the most {{prominent}} feature of Dracorex is the pair of huge and unrestricted superior temporal openings. The supratemporal fenestrae are much larger front-to-back and <b>side-to-side</b> than in Homalocephale, and larger than in Goyocephale. Only a fragmentary Wannanosaurus skull shows fenestrae as large as those of Dracorex. This fenestral architecture has been seen in ancient archosaurs, but not in other pachycephalosaurs.|$|E
25|$|Ideally, the {{advancing}} rear hoof oversteps {{the spot where}} the previously advancing front hoof touched the ground. The more the rear hoof oversteps, the smoother and more comfortable the walk becomes. Individual horses and different breeds vary in the smoothness of their walk. However, a rider will almost always feel some degree of gentle <b>side-to-side</b> motion in the horse's hips as each hind leg reaches forward.|$|E
25|$|Nests are build {{hanging from}} thin branches, often in Vachellia drepanolobium, {{sometimes}} in other acacia {{species such as}} umbrella thorn acacia (V. tortilis), blackthorn (Senegalia mellifera) or gum acacia (S. senegal). The nests have thick walls. These are constructed from grass straws, which, in the dry climates where P. arnaudi is found, keep well for many months. Nest are often constructed {{with two or three}} <b>side-to-side</b> or under old nests.|$|E
25|$|Air {{traffic control}} was {{notified}} {{at this point}} (at 17:19:15), who could not confirm any traffic in the indicated position. After three to five minutes the objects assumed a <b>side-to-side</b> configuration, which they maintained for another 10 minutes. They accompanied the aircraft with an undulating motion, and some back and forth rotation of the jet nozzles, {{which seemed to be}} under automatic control, causing them to flare with brighter or duller luminosity.|$|E
25|$|Major-General Oliver Nugent, the {{commander}} of the 36th Division, had used information from captured German orders and noted that German artillery could not bombard advancing British troops since German positions were distributed in depth and the forward zone was easily penetrated. The advance of supporting troops was much easier to obstruct but it was more important to help the foremost infantry. If counter-battery fire was insufficient, the covering fire in front of the advance was more important and counter-battery groups should change target. Nugent recommended that fewer field guns be used for the creeping barrage and that surplus guns should be grouped to fire sweeping barrages (from <b>side-to-side)</b> and that Shrapnel shells should be fuzed to burst higher up, to hit the inside of shell holes. Creeping barrages should be slower with more frequent and longer pauses, during which the barrages from field artillery and 60-pounder guns should sweep and search (move <b>side-to-side</b> and back-and-forth). Nugent suggested that infantry formations should change from skirmish lines to mobile company columns on narrow fronts, equipped with a machine-gun and Stokes mortar and move within a zone, since lines broke up under machine-gun fire in crater-fields and became disorganised.|$|E
25|$|Cellos are {{constructed}} and repaired using hide glue, which is strong but reversible, allowing for disassembly when needed. Tops may be glued on with diluted glue, since some repairs {{call for the}} removal of the top. Theoretically, hide glue is weaker than the body's wood, so as the top or back shrinks <b>side-to-side,</b> the glue holding it lets go, so the plate does not crack. Cellists repairing cracks in their cello do not use regular wood glue, because it cannot be steamed open when a repair has to be made by a luthier.|$|E
25|$|The {{putative}} {{function of}} SCO-spondin in neuronal differentiation is discussed regarding these features and homologies with other developmental molecules {{of the central}} nervous system exhibiting TSR domains, and involved in axonal guidance. Peptides corresponding to SCO-spondin TSR domains strongly increased adhesivity and neuritic outgrouth of cortical neurons and induced disaggregation of spinal cord neurons. Therefore, it is a candidate to interfere with neuronal development and/or axonal guidance during ontogenesis of {{the central nervous system}} in the modulation of <b>side-to-side</b> and side-to-substratum interactions, and also in promoting neurite outgrowth.|$|E
25|$|This {{aliasing}} {{is visible}} in images such as posters with lenticular printing: if they have low angular resolution, then as one moves past them, say from left-to-right, the 2D image does not initially change (so it appears to move left), then as one moves to the next angular image, the image suddenly changes (so it jumps right) – and the frequency and amplitude of this <b>side-to-side</b> movement corresponds to the angular resolution of the image (and, for frequency, {{the speed of the}} viewer's lateral movement), which is the angular aliasing of the 4D light field.|$|E
25|$|Once the yerba mate has settled, {{the mate}} is {{carefully}} {{brought to a}} near-sideways angle, with the opening tilted just slightly upward of the base. The mate is then shaken very gently with a <b>side-to-side</b> motion. This further settles the yerba mate inside the gourd so that the finest particles move toward the opening and the yerba is layered along one side. The largest stems and other bits create a partition between the empty space {{on one side of}} the gourd and the lopsided pile of yerba on the other.|$|E
25|$|Several {{muscles in}} the {{posterior}} of ankylosaurids (dorsalis caudae, ilio-caudalis, coccygeo-femoralis brevis, coccygeo-femoralis longus, ilio-tibialis, and ischio caudalis) were used for motion of the tail and tail club. Ankylosaurids tend to have horizontal rather than an obliquely vertical orientation of zygapophyseal articulations in the free caudal vertebrae of the tail. This arrangement is most effective for <b>side-to-side</b> rather than vertical mobility. The absence of musculature to elevate the tail, and this orientation of zygapophyses suggest that the tail and its club swept parallel to and slightly above the ground.|$|E
25|$|Stenonychosaurus {{had one of}} {{the largest}} known brains of any dinosaur, {{relative}} to its body mass (comparable to modern birds). This has been calculated as a cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio 31.5% to 63% of the way from a nonavian reptile proportion to a truly avian one. Additionally, it had bony cristae supporting their tympanic membranes that were ossified at least in their top and bottom regions. The rest of the cristae were either cartilaginous or too delicate to be preserved. The metotic strut of Stenonychosaurus was enlarged from <b>side-to-side,</b> similar to Dromaeosaurus and primitive birds like Archaeopteryx and Hesperornis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Side-to-side</b> {{movement}} of the stick controlled the large rudder. This produced a rolling motion because the wings both had substantial dihedral, through yaw-roll coupling. The rudder had to be quite large not only to produce adequate roll {{but also because the}} fuselage was very short, reducing the leverage of the rudder. The Flying Flea, being a two axis aircraft, could not be landed or taken off in substantial crosswinds. This was not a big issue when the aircraft was designed because at that time aircraft were usually flown from large open fields allowing all take-offs and landings into wind.|$|E
25|$|Combat in Mass Effect: Andromeda {{takes place}} in real-time, and unlike {{previous}} installments in the series, pausing the game to aim or use skills from a menu {{is no longer a}} feature. During action sequences, the player has direct control of Ryder from an over-the-shoulder perspective, who can move around the battlefield in a variety of ways, including a <b>side-to-side</b> dash or vertical leap into the air using a jetpack. When the player approaches an object, Ryder will automatically take cover, providing the player with protection in battle. The game encourages players to keep moving during combat with large, open battlefields and enemies that attack from all angles, but also allows for both aggressive and defensive strategies.|$|E
