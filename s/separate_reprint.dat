50|$|Unlike 2000 AD, reprint {{material}} {{has been extensively}} used {{in order to bring}} costs down. As well as older 2000 AD stories such as Helltrekkers, there have also been reprints that originate elsewhere, such as Preacher and Charley's War. Since the demise of 2000 AD Extreme Edition, a bimonthly 2000 AD spinoff which focused on reprints of old strips, a <b>separate</b> <b>reprint</b> supplement has been packaged with each issue of the Megazine, usually focusing on the work of a particular 2000 AD contributor or compiling a particular strip.|$|E

5000|$|The {{collectible}} {{card game}} Magic: The Gathering has released compilation sets, reprint sets, and box sets over its history. These are distinct from core sets and expansion sets, {{the most heavily}} marketed sources of new cards. With the exception of Chronicles, reprint sets generally do not affect tournament legality in supported formats; for example, cards reprinted in the Modern Masters reprint set, while legal for tournament play, did not necessarily cause the card {{to be included in}} the [...] "Standard" [...] environment. (If a card happened to be in Standard due to a <b>separate</b> <b>reprinting,</b> though, all [...] "versions" [...] of the card automatically become legal, including ones from a reprint set.) ...|$|R
50|$|Character and {{description}} of Kingia {{was first published}} in 1826 as a preprint. It appeared the following year as an appendix to Volume 2 of Phillip Parker King's Narrative of a survey of the intertropical and western coasts of Australia. It was subsequently republished in Volume 67 of the Philosophical Magazine, and in a number of <b>separate</b> <b>reprints,</b> including one in which it was paired with Cunningham's A few general remarks on the vegetation of certain coasts of Terra Australis. A French translation appeared in Annales des Sciences Naturelles in 1827, and German translations were published three times in 1827 and 1828, in Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck's Robert Brown's Vermischte botanische Schriften, then in Linnaea, and finally in Isis. In 1866 it was reprinted in John Joseph Bennett's The miscellaneous botanical works of Robert Brown.|$|R

5000|$|The initial {{publication}} of the play was somewhat irregular, in that Jonson intended to include it in a second folio collection of his works in 1631, but scrapped the plan when he was dissatisfied with the printing. Copies of the 1631 printed text were released, though whether they were sold publicly or circulated privately by Jonson is unclear. The play {{was included in the}} eventual second folio of Jonson's works (1640-1), published after his death in 1637, and also was issued in a <b>separate</b> [...] "variant <b>reprint</b> edition" [...] in 1641.|$|R
60|$|All I {{had to say}} of my {{writings}} {{is contained}} in my preface to {{the first of these}} volumes, printed for J. Tonson, and B. Lintot in quarto and folio in the year 1717; and all I have to say of myself will be found in my last Epistle.[1] I have nothing to add, but that this volume, and the above-mentioned contain whatsoever I have written, and[2] designed for the press, except my translation of the Iliad (with my preface and notes), of twelve books of the Odyssey, with the postscript (not the notes), the preface to Shakespeare, and a few Spectators[3] and Guardians. Whatever besides I have written, or joined in writing with Dr. Swift, Dr. Arbuthnot, or Mr. Gay (the only persons with whom I ever wrote in conjunction) {{are to be found in}} the four volumes of Miscellanies by us published.[4] I think them too inconsiderable to be <b>separated</b> and <b>reprinted</b> here; nevertheless, that none of my faults may be imputed to another, I must own that of the prose part, the Thoughts on Various Subjects at the end of the second volume, were wholly mine; and of the verses, the Happy Life of a Country Parson, the Alley in imitation of Spenser, the characters of Macer, Artimesia, and Phryne, the Verses to Mrs. M[artha] B[lount] on her Birth-day, and a few epigrams.[5] It will be but justice to me to believe that nothing more is mine, notwithstanding all that has been published in my name, or added to my[6] miscellanies since 1717,[7] by any bookseller whatsoever.|$|R
