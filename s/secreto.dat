25|$|Argentine cinema {{has also}} been prominenent since {{the first half of}} the 20th century and today averages over 60 {{full-length}} titles yearly. The industry suffered during the 1976–1983 military dictatorship; but re-emerged to produce the Academy Award winner The Official Story in 1985. A wave of imported U.S. films again damaged the industry in the early 1990s, though it soon recovered, thriving even during the Argentine economic crisis around 2001. Many Argentine movies produced during recent years have been internationally acclaimed, including Nueve reinas (2000), Son of the Bride (2001), El abrazo partido (2004), El otro (2007), the 2010 Foreign Language Academy Award winner El <b>secreto</b> de sus ojos and Wild Tales (2014).|$|E
25|$|The fiscal was {{in charge}} of {{presenting}} the accusation, investigating the denunciations and interrogating the witnesses by the use of physical and mental torture. The calificadores were generally theologians; it fell to them to determine if the defendant's conduct added up to a crime against the faith. Consultants were expert jurists who advised the court in questions of procedure. The court had, in addition, three secretaries: the notario de secuestros (Notary of Property), who registered the goods of the accused at the moment of his detention; the notario del <b>secreto</b> (Notary of the Secret), who recorded the testimony of the defendant and the witnesses; and the escribano general (General Notary), secretary of the court. The alguacil was the executive arm of the court, responsible for detaining, jailing, and physically torturing the defendant. Other civil employees were the nuncio, ordered to spread official notices of the court, and the alcaide, jailer in charge of feeding the prisoners.|$|E

On January 31, a reform committeecomposed of Carafa, Bourbon, Pacheco, Waldburg, de Silva, and Poledecided on thirteen new rules: limiting each cardinal to three conclavists, preventing cardinals from enlarging or switching assigned cells, prohibiting private meetings of more than three cardinals, banning eating together or sharing food, and confining the cardinals to their cells between 10:30 p.m. and dawn; physicians and barbers were each limited to three Italians, and one each of France, Germany, and Spain.|$|E

2500|$|The inquisitorial process {{consisted}} {{of a series of}} hearings, in which both the denouncers and the defendant gave testimony.

The archives of the Inquisition, in comparison to those of other judicial systems of the era, are striking in the completeness of their documentation.
