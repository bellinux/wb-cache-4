40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focuses on}} the {{structural}} optimization of chemical <b>sensor</b> <b>support</b> for food safety detection. The mechanical characteristic of chemical <b>sensor</b> <b>support</b> is influenced greatly by its structural parameters. Aiming at improving dynamic stiffness of the support, the modal analysis is implemented with the dynamic theory and the finite element analysis. And a group of rational structure parameters are determined through the optimum calculation. The validity simulation of the optimization is verified by the analyses of the random vibration and harmonic response. The results demonstrate that {{the performance of the}} support of the chemical sensor applied for the food detection is enhanced greatly by the presented optimization method here. 1 Foreword Over the past two decades or so, the chemical sensors have been investigated resulting in novel and very interesting devices with great promise for many areas of applications including food safety and security, with an insight to its future trends. Micro-electro-mechanical system, a new branch of Microelectronics, is proved to be of vital importance in designing micro devices which act both as sensors and actuators.
