40|$|Summary - The aim of {{the present}} study is to explore themes related to music therapy, {{children}} and young people and mental health. A qualitative, hermeneutic-phenomenological approach and semi-structured interviews with four music therapists, seeks to answer the research question What kind of position does self-esteem and sense of <b>self</b> <b>hold</b> in music therapy practice promoting childrens and young people´s mental health? The procedure chosen for the analysis is Interpretativ Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The results of the analysis shows that self-esteem and a sense of self can relate to music therapy, children and young people's mental helath in three main categories; Identity, Music therapy practice and Selfesteem/ sense of self, and seven ground categories: a place to feel free, mastery, social aspects, relationship, goals and working methods, change and coping. From a salutogenetic point of view, these categories have been discussed up against theories mostly from the field of music therapy and developmental psychology. - - Keywords: Self-esteem, sense of self, self-agency, mental health, children, adolescents, young people, music therapy, music...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{government}} commissioned the Crossing Bridges programme in 1998 (Falcov, 1998) and through legislation {{and a number}} of government policies and initiatives since, there has been emphasis on addressing the needs of families where there are parental mental health problems. Furthermore, there is a fast-growing body of research pointing to the needs of these families. However, service structures, development and provision have lagged behind. Most often parents with mental health difficulties have access to services addressing their individual mental health needs while their needs as parents and the needs of their children remain largely invisible. One such need that has been highlighted repeatedly in the literature is the need for children to have information about and make sense of their parent’s mental health difficulties. Given the lack of services to respond to this need, it is most often left to the parent to make decisions about and respond to their child’s search for understanding. This study is a qualitative study that explores parents’ experiences of decision-making and responding to this need, and the social processes and dominant discourses that impact on these experiences. Fifteen parents with mental health difficulties were interviewed, using semi-structured individual interviews, which were transcribed, and interpretive Grounded Theory was employed to analyse and interpret the data. The grounded theory that was constructed suggest two main social processes that impact on parents’ talking with their children about parental mental health issues. Firstly, within a relational context, parents were Negotiating mutuality between themselves and their children. Secondly, within an identity context, parents had to navigate Holding on to <b>self,</b> <b>holding</b> on to life. These social processes indicate that both parents’ relationships with their children and also their own sense of themselves within the context of their mental distress powerfully shape telling, talking and keeping silent. Implications of these findings both in relation to clinical interventions and future research are considered. In particular, the importance of positioning the parent as active role-player in the healing of their child, and positioning the child as active role-payer in their own meaning-making, are highlighted. Furthermore, developing ‘double-stories’ beyond the mental health story and beyond ‘information’ is emphasised and the importance of a sense of continuity of self and identity over time for parent and child is accentuated. Finally, the importance of allowing for complex and ever-evolving understandings of mental distress is indicated, and the role of both talking and remaining silent in this process is stressed...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1 : This chapter {{examines}} the logical {{consequences of the}} rather unsurprising notion that humans care about and manage their self-image, a notion long taken for granted by psychologists. I model this by assuming that decisionmakers derive utility from positive views about the <b>self,</b> <b>holding</b> constant standard utilitarian outcomes usually assumed relevant in economics. Other than this, agents are timeconsistent expected utility maximizers, are constrained in their updating by Bayes' rule, and can manipulate their beliefs only by controlling {{the flow of information}} that they receive. The motive to maintain a favorable self-image leads to a systematic rejection of free information about the self in certain states of the world and eventually to overconfident beliefs. Economically relevant decisions are affected by this overconfidence as well as the incentive to gather information about and make decisions so as to optimally manage beliefs. Agents might avoid informative actions when satisfied with their current beliefs ('self-image protection'), and seek out activities in which they can prove themselves when they are not ('self-image enhancement'), even if these choices are otherwise poor. These motives lead to a whole host of effects on behavior that other models have trouble explaining in a unified framework. The model can also make testable predictions on how these effects play themselves out across different categories of tasks and within a category of tasks over time. Applications to stock market participation, the choice between salaried and self-employment, career choice, manager behavior, and employee motivation are discussed. Chapter 2 : This chapter starts from the same premise as the previous one, the assumption that agents care about their self-image, but examines its consequences in a different information structure. Agents can improve financial decisions by making subjective judgments about their payoffs, while they derive ego utility from their perceptions regarding this ability. If the agent has a self-image protection motive, she will as a result be averse to making a subjective judgment and reviewing it later, since this combination is informative about ability. The consequence could be a sluggishness in responding to new information, procrastination in making up one's mind, or the reliance on inferior objective information. Possible remedies and applications are discussed, with particular attention to anxiety about health. Chapter 3 (with Peter Diamond) : There is overwhelming psychological evidence that some people run into self-control problems regularly, yet the effect of these findings on major life-cycle decisions hasn't been studied in detail. This paper extends Laibson's quasi-hyperbolic discounting savings model, in which each intertemporal self realizes that her time discount structure will lead to preference changes, and thus plays a game with her future selves. By making retirement endogenous, savings affect both consumption and work in the future. From earlier selves' points of view, the deciding self tends to retire too early, so {{it is possible that the}} self before saves less to induce her to work. However, still earlier selves think the pre-retirement self may do this too much, leading to possible higher saving on their part and eventual early retirement. Thus, the consumption path exhibits observational non-equivalence with exponential discounting. Observational non-equivalence also obtains on a number of comparative statics questions. For example, a self could have a negative marginal propensity to consume out of changes in future income. The outcome with naive agents, who fail to realize their self-control problem, is also briefly discussed. In that case, the deciding self's potential decision to retire despite earlier selves' plans results in a downward updating of available lifetime resources, and an empirically observed downward jump in the consumption path. by Botond Kőszegi.

One aspect of this discussion is the issue of a Muslim woman 2 ̆ 7 s consent in getting married and in sexual relations. The scholarship of Kecia Ali focuses on this issue of consent, and when she finds the Islamic legal tradition lacking in allowing for a woman 2 ̆ 7 s consent in marriage, she calls for Muslim women to engage in acts of 2 ̆ 2 personal reflection. 2 ̆ 2 This creates a binary concerning agency, wherein external norms (The Islamic Legal tradition) suppress agency, while true agency is only found in acting in accordance with internally felt desires. This thesis investigates the reasons why Ali folds into ideas of personal reflection to reconcile Islamic understandings of marriage with contemporary Western views. In order to do this, I explore Ali 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to the Islamic Tradition 2 ̆ 7 s ability to change to incorporate consent in marriage, and how she fails to substantiate such flexibility and adaptability.

In the second part of this thesis, I explore how the combined scholarship of Saba Mahmood and Ludwig Wittgenstein can provide enriched ways to understand agency.
