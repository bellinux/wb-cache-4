40|$|Various {{areas of}} {{technology}} require {{the generation of}} accurately known quasi-static multi-axis dipole or quasi-dipole magnetic fields in a region of free space. Traditionally, this is accomplished using arrays of small coils of wire driven by known or accurately-measured current sources. The traditional small coils cannot be accurately constructed, so the gener-ated fields must be laboriously characterized by measurements at various known points {{in the region of}} interest. Since the field-measuring instruments must themselves be calibrated, the measurement accuracy is problematic. A method of precisely constructing coil arrays would solve the problem by permitting the field to be calculated from knowledge of the coils’ geometry and of the current flowing in the coils. Use of printed-circuit techniques, combined with the kinematic rigidity of a regular tetrahedron, provides an inexpensive means of con-structing arrays of coils whose mechanical dimensions are accurately known.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} vector calculus {{definition of}} a force-free, field-aligned current in space is expanded in cylindrical coordinates to directly obtain the Bessel partial differential equation that specifies the magnetic field created by such a current. This result is often called the Lundquist solution. A simple but detailed derivation is included here. The physical properties of the resulting intricate magnetic field structure are described. The cause of its characteristic counter-rotation and counter-flows are identified. The describ- ing equations are put into state-variable form and a step-wise approximation is applied. This solution reveals the primary effect of the force-free parameter,, as being a scale factor of radial distance. We show that: 1) both the axial and azimuthal magnetic and current density components cyclically reverse their directions with radial distance from the central axis of the current; 2) the magnetic field extends farther from the central axis within a force-free field than it would if produced by a current in a long <b>straight</b> <b>conductor.</b> The total magnetic field magnitude and current density are shown to vary inversely as the square root of r.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the analysis and}} design methods of directional and omnidirectional inductively coupled {{wireless power transfer system}}s. Such system utilizes multiple coils to generate high frequency alternating magnetic fields in space and allows receivers to pick up power wirelessly in any position. The objective of optimization is to achieve the maximum power efficiency. Such kind of system allows the mobile devices to be continuously charged without staying on a fixed place. Self- and mutual- inductance values of the coils are critical parameters that affect the power efficiency of a wireless power transfer system. An improved numerical calculation method is proposed and is presented in this thesis. It combines the theory of partial equivalent element circuit (PEEC) and empirical equations for calculating certain types of <b>straight</b> <b>conductors.</b> The segmentation method to discretize the conductor is optimized and verified. The accuracy of the proposed method has been tested and compared to both theoretical equations and measurements of practical coils, and is proved to be accurate. The time-varying magnetic fields induced by the coils in a wireless power transfer system is the " of the energy. A time-efficient visualization method is proposed and is presented in this thesis. While commercial finite element analysis (FEA) software such as ANSYS Maxwell can perform transient analysis, the execution time is extremely long as the accuracy greatly depends on the simulation time steps and the number of iterations. The proposed method calculates the time-instant currents in coils with the derived mathematic model and then directly plots the time-varying magnetic fields. The execution time is shortened to a few of minutes on a desktop computer while the FEA solver takes a couple of hours on the same model. Several types of multiple-coil systems are analyzed with their magnetic field patterns. To transmit power to arbitrary directions, the magnetic field must be controlled with its directions. According to the principle of superposition, a three-orthogonal-coil transmitter structure is proposed. Several current control methods are discussed to achieve omnidirectional wireless power characteristics. One is a continuous scanning type current scheme. The receivers placed in the designated area can receive power with any locations and angles. Another one is a discrete scanning type. It can be used to detect the load position and therefore delivering power to the load with the maximum power efficiency of the overall system. Simulations and experiments have been carried out to verify the theory and they agreed well. While the aforesaid omnidirectional system adopts the special three-orthogonal-coil structure, the theory is generalized to arbitrary numbers of transmitters. It is proved by mathematical derivation that in a system with multiple transmitters and single receiver, there exists an optimal efficiency point when currents in the transmitter coils fulfill the certain relationships, regardless of the compensation scheme of the circuit, the use of magnetic materials and the shapes of the coils. An implementable method to calculate the optimal currents in a practical multiple-transmitter-single-receiver system is also provided. The generalized theory is verified by both simulations and experiments. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

The agreement between the results for the two laboratories that used the straight sample apparatus was quite good, within 15 % for all three conductors at 15 T, except at very high strain for one conductor which had an upper critical field close to the measurement field. To make a comparison with the data obtained using the spring method, it was necessary to fit the data to the compressive prestrain determined using the straight-sample technique. With such a fit, the agreement was variable, between 15 and 25 % depending on the conductor.

40|$|The transmit–receive (Tx/Rx) {{birdcage}} {{head coil}} {{is often used}} for excitation instead of the body coil because of the presumably lower risk of heating in and around conductive implants. However, this common practice has not been systematically tested. To investigate whether the Tx/Rx birdcage head coil produces less heating than the body coil when scanning individuals with implants, we used a 3 T clinical scanner and made temperature measurements around a <b>straight</b> 15 cm <b>conductor</b> using either the Tx/Rx body or the head coil for excitation. Additionally, the transmitted fields of a Tx/Rx head coil were measured both in air and in gel using a resonant and a non-resonant B field probes {{as well as a}} non-resonant E field probe. Simulations using a finite-difference time domain solver were compared with the experimental findings. When the body coil was used for excitation, we observed heating around the 15 cm wire at various anatomical locations (both within and outside of the active volume of the head coil). Outside its active area, no such heating was observed while using the Tx/Rx head coil for excitation. The E and B fields of the Tx/Rx birdcage head coil extended well-beyond the physical dimensions of the coil. In air, the fields were monotonically decreasing, while in gel they were more complex with local maxima {{at the end of the}} ASTM phantom. These experimental findings were line with the simulations. While caution must always be exercised when scanning individuals with metallic implants, these findings support the use of the Tx/Rx birdcage head coil in place of the body coil at 3 T in order to reduce the risk of heating in and around conductive implants that are remote from the head coil...|$|R
