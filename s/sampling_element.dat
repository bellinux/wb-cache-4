40|$|AbstractThe {{hypothesis}} that reductions in Snellen acuities {{in patients with}} retinitis pigmentosa are due solely to losses of photoreceptors was tested by measuring the effects of random losses of sampling elements on letter identification. <b>Sampling</b> <b>element</b> losses were mimicked by setting the luminance of randomly selected pixels equal to the luminance of the surround. The amount of pixel blanking ranged from 0 to 90 %. Letters varying in retinal subtense from 5 to 17 min arc were presented for 500 msec. Although letter identification accuracy decreased with increasing pixel blanking for all letter sizes, performance remained relatively high even when {{a majority of the}} pixels was blanked. The data suggest that unless the loss of cone photoreceptors in greater than 80 %, loss of sampling elements alone can not account for letter acuities poorer than 20 / 40. In addition to loss of cone photoreceptors in patients with RP, there are histological reports of photoreceptor abnormalities and psychophysical studies of visual sensory deficits. It is conceivable that these alone, or in combination with losses of photoreceptors, could account for decreased visual acuity. In a series of experiments, stimulus parameters were manipulated in order to mimic the effects of some of these abnormalities and deficits and the effects on letter identification were examined. The results of these experiments demonstrated that <b>sampling</b> <b>element</b> loss interacts with sensory factors (e. g. luminance and contrast sensitivity) and perceptual factors (e. g. set size and letter orientation) to reduce letter identification accuracy. The implication of these results is that decreases in letter acuity observed in patients with retinitis pigmentosa cannot be attributedsolely to a random loss of sampling elements in the underlying retina, but {{may be due to the}} combination of photoreceptor degeneration and other sensory and perceptual factors...|$|E
40|$|International audienceError {{detection}} and correction based on double-sampling {{is used as}} common technique to handle timing errors while scaling V dd for energy efficiency. An additional <b>sampling</b> <b>element</b> is inserted in the critical paths of the design, to double sample the outputs of those logic paths at different time instances that may fail while scaling the supply voltage or the clock frequency of the design. However, overclocking, and error {{detection and}} correction capabilities of the double sampling methods are limited due to the fixed speculation window which lacks adaptability for tracking variations such as temperature. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic speculation window {{to be used in}} double sampling schemes for timing error detection and correction in pipelined logic paths. The proposed method employs online slack measurement and conventional shadow flipflop approach to adaptively overclock or underclock the design and also to detect and correct timing errors due to temperature and other variability effects. We demonstrate this method in the Xilinx Virtex VC 707 FPGA for various benchmarks. We achieve a maximum of 71 % overclocking with a limited area overhead of 1. 9 % LUTs and 1. 7 % flip-flops...|$|E
40|$|Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) is a {{technique}} that gives simultaneously the spectrum of each spatial <b>sampling</b> <b>element</b> in a given object field. It is a powerful tool which rearranges the data cube (x, y, lambda) represented by two spatial dimensions defining {{the field and the}} spectral decomposition in a detector plane. In IFS, the spatial unit reorganizes the field and the spectral unit is being composed of a classical spectrograph. The development of a Collimating Slicer aims at proposing a new type of integral field spectrograph which should be more compact. The main idea is to combine the image slicer with the collimator of the spectrograph, thus mixing the spatial and spectral units. The traditional combination of slicer, pupil and slit elements and the spectrograph collimator is replaced by a new one composed of a slicer and collimator only. In this paper, {{the state of the art}} of integral field spectroscopy using image slicers is described. The new system based onto the development of a Collimating Slicer for optical integral field spectroscopy is depicted. First system analysis results and future improvements are discussed. It finally turns out that this new system looks very promising for low resolution spectroscopy. Comment: 13 page...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concerns the}} investigation of current {{problems associated with the}} analysis and design of tunable continuous time bandpass (CT BP) sigma-delta (CA) modulators. This specific modulator group is particularly promising within the context of softwaredefined radios. However, due to the nonlinear <b>sampling</b> <b>element</b> within a closed-loop sdomain system, the high level of analytical complexity makes current CT BP CA modulators difficult to implement. Specific problems addressed in this research were the fundamental principles of the CA modulation process, analytical and design methodology, loop delay compensation techniques, monolithic implementation and possible application areas. Theoretical general closed form solutions for the center frequency tunable CT BP CA modulator with fractional delays were derived, defining a new sub-class of fractional CT BP CA modulators. The developed subclass offers numerous possible solutions to existing problems in CA modulator based circuits, such as loop delay compensation and signal upconversion. A theoretical CT BP CA design methodology was then modified to be suitable for mixed-signal integrated circuit (IC) design flow, currently used in both industrial and academic environments. In order to experimentally demonstrate these new analytical concepts, an IC prototype of the proposed fractional CA modulator was designed, manufactured in SiGe technology, and tested. This research showed that the developed fractional CT BP CA modulator concept is a feasible option for future wireless networks; thus providing the crucial element required for software-defined radios...|$|E

This new development {{was due to the}} need to know the reality of that area to make comparative inferences based on the previously obtained results, considering that the current socio-economic situation has affected the amount of dogs that are abandoned. As it was mentioned in the first investigation, the most vulnerable age group is children between two and six years old; so the existence of favorable conditions for the presentation of this disease is a public health problem. This time, it was sampled 6 of the existing 12 public places in city downtown's south area, where sampling elements of soil was taken to form a pool of samples in each site; each <b>sampling</b> <b>element</b> parasitologically analyzed showed the existence of Toxocara eggs, representing a 100 % of parasitic contamination.

40|$|Non-destructive {{photographic}} {{techniques are}} valuable for surveying benthic epifauna in sensitive areas. Inherent in these techniques, however, are selectivity biases {{related to the}} scale at which surveys are conducted. Such biases have not been addressed for surveys of marine benthos. The present study surveyed epifaunal assemblages at two depths (8 m and 20 m) and three locations close to Rothera Point, Adelaide Island, Antarctica. Two scales of photographic sampling were employed in order to encompass {{a broad range of}} taxon sizes and distributions, and their parallel use allowed qualitative and quantitative comparisons to be made between results from each scale. An additional physical <b>sampling</b> <b>element</b> was incorporated to assess sessile cryptic assemblages. A total of 79 faunal taxa from 10 phyla, together with 6 algal taxa, were recorded in the survey. Echinoderms were the most speciose group at both photographic scales, whereas cryptic assemblages were dominated by bryozoans. There were clear resolution-related differences between scales but all three methods revealed pronounced differences in assemblages by depth and location. Assemblages at both depths were notable for consistently high densities (~ 100 individuals m– 2) of the regular echinoid Sterechinus neumayeri, and at 8 m for high densities (~ 100 individuals m– 2) of the limpet Nacella concinna. The results emphasise the general requirement for sampling methodologies to be matched to the size spectra of the organisms under study and, more specifically, highlight the need for studies to assess the relative importance of biotic and physical factors in structuring the Antarctic benthos...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, the Sensitivity Analysis {{methodology}} {{is applied}} to numerical welding simulation in order to rank the importance of input variables on the outputs of the code like distorsions or residual stresses. The numerical welding simulation uses the Finite Element Method, with a thermal computation followed by a mechanical one. Classically, a Local Sensitivity Analysis is performed, hence {{the validity of the}} results is limited to the neighborhood of a nominal point, and cross effects cannot be detected. This study implements a Global Sensitivity Analysis which allows to screen the whole material space of the steel family mechanical properties. A set of inputs of the mechanical model [...] material properties that are temperature-dependent [...] is generated with the help of Latin Hypercube Sampling. The same welding simulation is performed with each <b>sampling</b> <b>element</b> as input data. Then, output statistical processing allows us to classify the relative input inﬂuences by means of different sensitivity indices estimates. Two different welding conﬁgurations are studied. Considering their major differences, they give a different ranking of inputs, but both of them show that only a few parameters are responsible of the variability of the outputs. To prove it a posteriori for the ﬁrst conﬁguration, two series of computations are performed for a complete sample and for its reduced copy [...] where all the secondary parameters are set to mean values. They match perfectly, showing a substantial economy can be done by giving {{to the rest of the}} inputs mean values. Sensitivity analysis has then provided answers to what we consider one of the probable frequently asked questions regarding welding simulation: for a given welding conﬁguration, which properties must be measured with a good accuracy and which ones can be simply extrapolated or taken from a similar material? That leads us to propose a comprehensive methodology for welding simulations including four sequential steps: a problem characterization, a sensitivity analysis, an experimental campaign, simulations...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the integral field spectroscopy (IFS) {{capability of the}} Gemini Near-infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS) installed on the Gemini-South telescope. This makes use of the Advanced Image Slicer (AIS) optical concept of Content. Image slicing is, in principle, the most efficient technique of IFS. Our design is more compact and adaptable than the previous designs of this type so that the spectrograph can be switched to IFS mode simply by insertion of the integral field unit (IFU) into the focal plane. The near-optimal performance of the system makes it {{a good choice for}} instrumentation for future observatories, especially for the multiple-IFS systems required for extremely large telescopes (ELTs). The IFU produces good image quality and high throughput (> 90 per cent at wavelengths ≥ 2. 5 μm) which can actually exceed that of a spectrograph with a conventional slit of the same width, due to the use of anamorphism that reduces losses due to diffraction. This also results in a square spatial <b>sampling</b> <b>element</b> (spaxel) while simultaneously providing Nyquist sampling of the slit. At short wavelengths, the throughput is determined by the quality of the finish of the optical surfaces but exceeds 60 per cent at 1 μm. The three multifaceted mirror arrays in the slicing unit were made as monolithic units to avoid alignment errors between slices. This required the development of new freeform diamond-machining techniques which we describe. We present results on the testing of the optical components, and system-level tests to verify performance. We show that the IFU performs better than our expectations in terms of image quality and scattered light and that our model of the throughput, when fed with the results of our metrology of the surface quality, gives an accurate description of the performance measured in the laboratory. Paper 2 gives the results of on-sky testing to confirm the results of the laboratory tests and to verify performance by reference to existing data sets obtained with conventional techniques. The verification of our performance model is of great importance to the planning of future instrumentation of this type, as is the 'plug-and-play' nature of the integration with the spectrograph.

40|$|M. A. Although {{all forms}} of {{apartheid}} control legislation have been repealed and the Constitution and Bill of Rights adopted, it is questionable in what way these principles of equality and non-discrimination are effectively implemented and whether changes have occurred in practice. Chapter one therefore {{provides an overview of}} the study. The discussion of legislation viz. the Constitution, the Equality Clause and Employment Equity Act urges the elimination of discrimination and the implementation of equality. The legacy of policing also provides the challenge to change. Several SAPS policies and directives such as the SAPS Policy Document on Affirmative Action and Fundamental Equality Directives in theory indicate the movement towards change and initiatives to implement equality and eliminate discrimination. It is therefore impressive to have legislation, policies and directives, but the question is in what way these are effectively being implemented and whether one can notice a change in the actual behaviour of police officials. Equality and non-discrimination, which {{are at the heart of}} effective policing, underpin good community and human relations. It is important to assess in what way the SA police culture and working climate have changed from a traditional partisan and discriminatory approach to a service provider that celebrates diversity and human rights. The research therefore investigates in what way the rhetoric of equality and non-discrimination have been implemented and its effect on individuals in a policing environment. The perceived gap between policy legislation and reality in practice was a further motivational aspect of the study, as policy alone will not ensure the implementation of equality principles. The goal and objectives of the study narrow the focus and the presentation of definitions provides further clarity. The research nature for this study was primarily explorative, and also descriptive. The goal of the study was to explore and describe police officials' experience and behaviour in the implementation of equality and the elimination of discriminatory practices in the working environment at police station level during the period 1996 - 7. This research was primarily of a qualitative nature and a single embedded case study design strategy was used. The unit /item of analysis or <b>sampling</b> <b>element</b> was police officials working under the jurisdiction of one specific police station in Gauteng. The demographic profile and characteristics of the police officials in the study sample was presented and analysed quantitatively (SSPS descriptive statistics according to frequency counts and cross tabulations) and achieved the first secondary objective of exploring and describing the level of representivity at the police station being studied. A non-probability sampling method - based on convenience and reliance on available subjects - was the primary sampling strategy used. Other secondary types of sampling used in this study were snowball or chain, confirming and disconfirming cases, opportunistic, and a combination or mixed strategies...|$|E
40|$|M. Ed. Our {{nation was}} founded on the {{principle}} that the individual has infinite dignity and worth. The South African Police Service exists to keep the nation secured and at peace by intensifying correct security measures throughout the country. The only way to ensure police productivity and create police professionalism is through all-inclusive human resource management that will involve all stakeholders in an organisation in decision making. Generally sound labour relations that consist of mutual respect; good faith bargaining and responsible conflict and dispute management mechanisms should prevail in the South African Police Services. It is therefore important to have legislation, policies and directives that should be effectively implemented to motivate and accelerate change in the behaviour of police officials. Glasser mentioned that human behaviour is influenced by the individual himself rather than by external forces but with police officials external influences contribute to a change in behaviour; thus they need support from the management of the South African Police Service. The psychological impact of experiences of aggression by police officials in the South African Police Service is discussed from a psycho-educational perspective. This perspective will encourage Police Inspectors' to deal with their experiences of aggression. The research nature of this study was primarily explorative, and also descriptive. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore and describe police officials' experiences of aggression in the South African Police Service. This research was of a qualitative nature. The <b>sampling</b> <b>element</b> was Police inspectors working under the jurisdiction of specific police stations in Gauteng Province. Data gathering methods used in this research were individual interviews and observations. The observation for this study was conducted by the researcher at the community service centre (charge office). A total of eleven interviews were conducted but only six were audiotaped and other participants used an answer sheet in responding to the interview and all of them were transcribed and edited. The participants had to comment on their experiences of aggression in the South African Police Service. These eleven interviews formed the basis of this study to facilitate the attainment of the primary objective, which was to explore and describe the experience of aggression by Police Inspectors in the South African Police Service. The data from these interviews were analysed using an open coding method. An independent coder did an analysis independent from the researcher. A consensus validation discussion was held with the independent coder on the codification of the data. The detailed discussion of results obtained from the interviews and observations were presented in verbatim quotes, descriptive and reflective notes and the illustration of emergent themes and categories. Rigour and adequacy were ensured by data collected and the results obtained from data analysis indicated convergence and saturation. The integration of trustworthiness, that is, credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability were applied throughout the study. Ethical considerations and consent letters were presented to the participants, including preserving of anonymity, confidentiality and the ethical role of the researcher has adhered to. The research is very important as the experiences of aggression by police officials in the South African Police Service were explored and described. The research results indicated that there is tension among senior officers and junior police officials in the South African Police Service. Junior officials are of the opinion that their seniors ignore them when they are making decisions. The Police Inspectors under study are demoralised and tend to become negative towards the public. It is evident from the results that there is lack of effective communication between senior and junior staff in the South African Police Service. In conclusion, it is evident that aggression really exists in the workplace and officials are affected by such aggression. The guidelines of dealing with aggression in the South African Police Service were described in a psycho-education perspective...|$|E

40|$|Adults' self-reports {{about their}} choices in a delayed matching-to-sample task were studied as a {{function}} of the number of elements (one, two, or three) in a compound sample stimulus. Signal-detection analyses were used to examine control of self-reports by the number of <b>sample</b> <b>elements,</b> by the speed and accuracy of choices reported about, and by several events contingent on self-reports. On each matching-to-sample trial, a <b>sample</b> <b>element</b> appeared as one of two comparison stimuli. Choice of the matching element, if made within 500 ms of the onset of the comparison stimuli, produced points worth money or chances in a drawing for money, depending on the subject. After each choice, subjects pressed either a "yes" or "no" button to answer a computer-generated query about whether the choice met the point contingency. The number of <b>sample</b> <b>elements</b> in the matching-to-sample task varied across trials, and events contingent on self-reports varied across experimental conditions. In Experiment 1, the conditions were defined by different combinations of feedback messages and point consequences contingent on self-reports, but self-reports were systematically influenced only by the sample-stimulus manipulation. Self-report errors increased with the number of <b>sample</b> <b>elements.</b> False alarms (inaccurate reports of success) were far more common than misses (inaccurate reports of failure), and false alarms were especially likely after choices that were correct but too slow to meet the point contingency. Sensitivity (A') of self-reports decreases as the number of <b>sample</b> <b>elements</b> increased. In addition, self-reports were more sensitive to choice accuracy than to choice speed. All subjects showed a pronounced bias (B'H) for reporting successful responses, although the bias was reduced as the number of <b>sample</b> <b>elements</b> increased and successful choices became less frequent. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the failure of point contingencies to influence self-reports in the first experiment was not due to a general ineffectiveness of the point consequences.
