5|$|At {{an early}} stage, in {{documents}} {{written in the}} paleo-Hebrew script, words were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots, as reflected by the Mesha Stone, the Siloam inscription, the Ophel inscription, and paleo-Hebrew script documents from Qumran. Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions; however, there is not direct evidence for biblical texts being written without word division, as suggested by Nahmanides {{in his introduction to}} the Torah. Word division using spaces was commonly used {{from the beginning of the}} 7th century BCE for documents in the Aramaic script. In addition to marking vowels, the Tiberian system also uses cantillation marks, which serve to mark word stress, <b>semantic</b> <b>structure,</b> and the musical motifs used in formal recitation of the text.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{linguistics}} views linguistic {{structure as}} arising continuously out of usage. Speakers are forever discovering {{new ways to}} convey meanings by producing sounds, {{and in some cases}} these novel strategies become conventionalised. Between phonological structure and <b>semantic</b> <b>structure</b> there is no causal relationship. Instead, each novel pairing of sound and meaning involves an imaginative leap.|$|E
500|$|All {{languages}} {{contain the}} <b>semantic</b> <b>structure</b> of predication: {{a structure that}} predicates a property, state, or action. Traditionally, semantics has been understood to be the study of how speakers and interpreters assign truth values to statements, so that meaning is understood to be {{the process by which}} a predicate can be said to be true or false about an entity, e.g. [...] "" [...] or [...] "". Recently, this model of semantics has been complemented with more dynamic models of meaning that incorporate shared knowledge about the context in which a sign is interpreted into the production of meaning. Such models of meaning are explored in the field of pragmatics.|$|E

2500|$|Such {{flexibility}} {{has to do}} {{with the}} language's intended capability to translate as many expressions of natural languages as possible, based on a unique positional case system.

The objective of this work is to study, {{in the context of}} conceptual indexing, the influence of query <b>semantic</b> <b>structuring</b> to the precision of information retrieval system. We study an ontology based matching using concepts by applying some variants of language models.

40|$|Abstract. Gene Ontology (GO) {{has been}} {{developed}} to provide concepts for the functional annotation of biological entities. This development has already contributed to significant biomedical research results. Nonetheless, GO could have provided even stronger support to biomedical text mining, if it delivered domain-independent logical definitions of its concepts. We present a method that extracts the <b>semantic</b> <b>structures</b> of GO terms by using the Gene Regulation Ontology (GRO). The method annotates substrings of GO terms with, if any, corresponding concepts of OBO ontologies and then converts the syntactic structures of GO terms into GRO-based <b>semantic</b> <b>structures.</b> We show that the <b>semantic</b> <b>structures</b> {{can be used to}} deduce implied relations from GO terms. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ontology Matching is {{nowadays}} a vivid area of Computer Science. There {{are several}} OM tools looking for correspondences between entities of ontologies. These correspondences are usual simple equivalence mapping pairs classto-class or property-to-property. In our work we concentrate on diverse kinds of <b>semantic</b> <b>structures</b> in ontologies {{in terms of}} their detection and mutual matching. For this kind of matching not only equivalence relations as well as not only homogeneous correspondences are envisaged. The paper is a report from {{the first phase of the}} work aiming at ontology matching via pattern-based detection of <b>semantic</b> <b>structures</b> in OWL ontologies. In this initial phase we mainly pay attention to n-ary relations and their discovery in OWL ontologies. Subsequent phases lie in description of conditions of semantic matching between <b>semantic</b> <b>structures.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. Memory {{training}} {{in combination with}} practice in <b>semantic</b> <b>structuring</b> and word fluency {{has been shown to}} improve memory performance. This study investigated the efficacy of a working memory training combined with exercises in <b>semantic</b> <b>structuring</b> and word fluency and examined whether training effects generalize to other cognitive tasks. Methods. In this double-blind randomized control study, 36 patients with memory impairments following brain damage were allocated to either the experimental or the active control condition, with both groups receiving 9 hours of therapy. The experimental group received a computer-based working memory training and exercises in word fluency and <b>semantic</b> <b>structuring.</b> The control group received the standard memory therapy provided in the rehabilitation center. Patients were tested on a neuropsychological test battery before and after therapy, resulting in composite scores for working memory; immediate, delayed, and prospective memory; word fluency; and attention. Results. The experimental group improved significantly in working memory and word fluency. The training effects also generalized to prospective memory tasks. No specific effect on episodic memory could be demonstrated. Conclusion. Combined treatment of working memory training with exercises in <b>semantic</b> <b>structuring</b> is an effective method for cognitive rehabilitation of organic memory impairment...|$|R
