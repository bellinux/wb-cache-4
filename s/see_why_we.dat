But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class.

[...] Frank O'Connor, 343's creative director, said that such a move was vital: [...] "If you look at how George Lucas held on to Star Wars, not just to make money from action figures but to control the direction the universe went in, you can <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> think it's pretty vital." ...|$|E
500|$|Producing {{the first}} video {{proved to be}} a {{difficult}} task for Jackson. State authorities unsuccessfully tried to ban the singer filming in Salvador (Pelourinho) and in Rio de Janeiro. Officials in the state of Rio feared images of poverty might affect tourism and accused Jackson of exploiting the poor. Ronaldo Cezar Coelho, the state secretary for Industry, Commerce and Tourism demanded editing rights over the finished product, stating, [...] "I don't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> should have to facilitate films that will contribute nothing to all our efforts to rehabilitate Rio's image". Some were concerned that scenes of poverty and human rights abuses would affect their chances of hosting the Olympics in 2004. Others supported Jackson's wish to highlight the problems of the region, arguing that the government were embarrassed by their own failings.|$|E

500|$|In 1968, Wright {{commented on}} Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: [...] "It's hard to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> were {{cast as the}} first British {{psychedelic}} group. We never saw ourselves that way... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted... the emphasis... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation." [...] Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: [...] "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all {{so we had to}} do something stupid and 'experimental'...Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't {{want to go back to}} playing [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for hours and hours." [...] Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|Saint-Gaudens {{originally}} conceived {{a flying}} eagle {{design for the}} cent, but at Roosevelt's request, developed it for the double eagle after learning that by law, an eagle could not appear on the cent. [...] Writer and friend Witter Bynner recalled that in , Saint-Gaudens was seriously ill with cancer, and was carried to his studio for ten minutes a day to critique {{the work of his}} assistants on current projects, including the cent. Saint-Gaudens sent Roosevelt a design in February for the obverse of the cent showing a figure of Liberty. [...] Roosevelt suggested the addition of a Native American war bonnet, stating, [...] "I don't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> should not have a conventional head-dress of purely American type for the Liberty figure." [...] In , Roosevelt instructed that the Indian design be developed for the eagle instead. [...] Saint-Gaudens was by then in declining health; he died on , 1907, without having submitted another design for the cent.|$|E

It might be our last {{full-length}} record for a little while, but we've got a lot of things lined up that we want to record, so I think that will happen pretty soon." [...] In early 2010, drummer Brian Lane stated that Brand New were unsure about how they plan to release music in the future with technology being a factor; [...] "I don’t know if there’s a point to releasing records if they’re not physical releases, if we're going to release a lot of things digitally then I don’t <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> couldn’t release a song a week or a song a month or just put out what we like from whenever we record." [...] Lane also discussed the way the band may release their records in the future, [...] "We’re talking about recording another album but we don’t know whether it’s going to come out on a label or whether we just release songs in batches." ...|$|E

Ewbank took over a team that had not had a winning record in its first three years of existence and hired a coaching staff that included Chuck Knox, Walt Michaels and Clive Rush, all of whom later became head coaches.

2500|$|In {{summarizing}} the biographical works on Gandhi, Blema S. Steinberg concluded she was decidedly non-ideological. Only 7.4% (24) {{of the total}} 330 biographical extractions posit ideology {{as a reason for}} her policy choices. Steinberg noted Gandhi's association with socialism was superficial; only having a general and traditional commitment to the ideology, by way of her political and family ties. Gandhi personally had a fuzzy concept of socialism. In one of the early interviews she had given as Prime Minister, Gandhi had ruminated: [...] "I suppose you could call me a socialist, but you have understand what we mean by that term...we used the word [...] because it came closest to {{what we wanted to do}} here – which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it socialism; but if by using that word we arouse controversy, I don't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> should use it. I don't believe in words at all." [...] Regardless of the debate over her ideology or lack of thereof, Gandhi remains a left-wing icon. She has been described by Hindustan Times columnist, Pankaj Vohra as [...] "arguably the greatest mass leader of the last century." [...] Her campaign slogan, Garibi Hatao (Eng: Remove Poverty), has become the iconic motto of the Indian National Congress. To the rural and urban poor, untouchables, minorities and women in India, Gandhi was [...] "Indira Amma or Mother Indira." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 20 March 2008 Daly {{introduced}} a resolution which criticized {{the human rights}} record of China and urged officials representing San Francisco during the upcoming Olympic torch ceremonies (scheduled for 9 April 2008) to [...] "make publicly known that the 2008 Summer Games torch is received with alarm and protest." [...] Daly's resolution was covered extensively by the local media and elevated the issues of treatment of protests {{in relation to the}} Olympics being held in China, the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay and the torch ceremonies being held in San Francisco, the only North American stop. The torch relay {{will be the first time}} in Olympics history that protests will accompany the torch as it passes through a U.S. city. [...] Daly stated, [...] "he magnitude of attention paid to the Olympic Games and the torch relay makes the event the appropriate platform to discuss human rights. If someone can look you in the face and tell you the Olympics are limited to the individual competitions that take place, well, that's a good poker player." [...] Daly also criticized the rare decision to set up designated [...] "free-speech zones" [...] stating, [...] "I don't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> should break from our pattern of how we handle mass protests or demonstrations for China." [...] San Francisco mayor, Gavin Newsom, said he has [...] "very serious concerns" [...] about the situation in Tibet but added San Francisco is [...] "privileged" [...] to be the torch's only stop in North America and that the event should rise above political concerns and that the Games should be a time [...] "to focus on the things that unite us and not divide us." [...] In a later committee meeting supervisors Carmen Chu and Sean Elsbernd amended the resolution to welcome the Global Human Rights Torch Relay on April 5 and the Tibetan Freedom Torch on April 8 and commend [...] "their efforts to raise awareness regarding human rights violations in China and urging the San Francisco City Representatives ... to welcome the Torch in the explicit spirit of Olympism, consistent with the United Nations Charter ... and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights." ...|$|E
