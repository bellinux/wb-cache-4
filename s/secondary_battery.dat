5|$|The <b>secondary</b> <b>battery</b> {{consisted}} of twelve 6-inch (15.2cm) Mk VII guns mounted in casemates in the hull around the forward superstructure. These guns were chosen because the 4-inch (10.2cm) guns on earlier battleships were {{deemed to be}} too weak and have too short a range to effectively combat torpedo boats with newer, more powerful torpedoes. Admiral Jackie Fisher had opposed the idea of increasing the <b>secondary</b> <b>battery,</b> though {{he retired from the}} post of First Sea Lord in 1910. As a result, the Iron Dukes, which were designed in 1911, received the larger 6inch gun.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the battle, Seydlitz was hit 21 times by heavy-caliber shells, twice by <b>secondary</b> <b>battery</b> shells, and once by a torpedo. The ship {{suffered}} a total of 98 of her crew killed and 55 wounded. Seydlitz herself fired 376 main battery shells and scored approximately 10 hits.|$|E
5|$|For armament, the Rivadavia {{class was}} {{equipped}} with a main battery of twelve 12-inch/50 caliber guns, a <b>secondary</b> <b>battery</b> of twelve 6 inch (152 mm)/50 and twelve 4-inch (102mm)/50 QF, and two 21-inch (533mm) torpedo tubes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> {{are just}} as {{important}} as main batteries. Typically, these guns are half the size of the main batteries but equal in range. These guns are generally multipurpose guns, being used for ship-to-ship, anti aircraft, and general bombardment. In the series Blood & Chrome Galactica is shown fitted with 68 (34 port, 34 starboard) <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> for a total of 136 rifles (assuming they are 2-rifled batteries) on her dorsal side to compliment her main batteries. Because of their smaller caliber they can fire at a faster rate than their larger counterparts. For example, an Iowa class battleship's main 16-inch batteries fire at 2-6 rounds per minute per rifle or 18-54 rounds/minute. Whereas the smaller 5-inch <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> fire at 15-20 per minute/rifle (5 2-rifled batteries per side), or 150-200 5-inch rounds per minute, a difference of 2.5-5 times. The same can be assumed for the Galactica. If her main batteries fire 15-20 rounds/minute/rifle, then it can be assumed her <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> fire 40-80 rounds/min/rifle. Again simple math suggests that a full one minute barrage of the <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> can fire between 5,540-10,880 rounds per minute from the dorsal side alone.|$|R

5|$|Given {{their limited}} displacement, the Indiana class had {{formidable}} armament for the time: four 13-inch guns, an intermediate battery of eight 8-inch guns and a <b>secondary</b> <b>battery</b> of four 6-inch guns, twenty Hotchkiss 6-pounders, and six Maxim-Nordenfelt 1-pounders, {{as well as}} six 18 inch (450 mm) tubes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>secondary</b> <b>battery</b> served {{several other}} roles. It was hoped that a medium-calibre shell {{might be able}} to score a hit on an enemy dreadnought's {{sensitive}} fire control systems. It was also felt that the secondary armament could {{play an important role in}} driving off enemy cruisers from attacking a crippled battleship.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, Kaiser {{had fired}} 224 heavy battery and 41 <b>secondary</b> <b>battery</b> shells; Kaiserin fired 160 and 135 respectively, Prinzregent Luitpold fired 169 and 106 respectively, and Friedrich der Grosse fired 72 and 151 shells, respectively. Kaiser was hit twice by heavy-caliber shells during the battle, the only ship {{of the class}} to have been hit; however the ship only {{suffered}} a single wounded casualty.|$|E
5|$|The Mark 37 {{directors}} for the <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> were {{fitted with}} the Mark 4 radar.

40|$|Based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Eco-indicator 99 method, a LCA {{model was}} applied to conduct {{environmental}} impact and end-of-life treatment policy analysis for <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries.</b> This model evaluated the cycle, recycle and waste treatment stages of <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries.</b> Nickel-Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) batteries and Lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries were chosen as the typical <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> in this study. Through this research, the following results were found: (1) A basic number of cycles should be defined. A minimum cycle number of 200 would result in an obvious decline of environmental loads for both battery types. Batteries with high energy density and long life expectancy have small environmental loads. Products and technology that help increase energy density and life expectancy should be encouraged. (2) <b>Secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> should be sorted out from municipal garbage. Meanwhile, different types of discarded batteries should be treated separately under policies and regulations. (3) The incineration rate has obvious impact on the Eco-indicator points of Nickel-Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) batteries. The influence of recycle rate on Lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries is more obvious. These findings indicate that recycling is the most promising direction for reducing secondary batteries’ environmental loads. The model proposed here {{can be used to}} evaluate environmental loads of other <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries</b> and it can be useful for proposing policies and countermeasures to reduce the environmental impact of <b>secondary</b> <b>batteries...</b>|$|R

5|$|In early 1945, {{while under}} repair for combat damage, Mississippi {{received}} a new <b>secondary</b> <b>battery.</b> The old 51-caliber 5-inch guns were removed, and eight {{more of the}} 25-caliber anti-aircraft guns were installed, along with thirteen quadruple Bofors 40 mm mounts and forty 20 mm Oerlikon guns.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} fitting out, the ship's {{flagship}} facilities, {{including those}} on the bridge and in the admiral's cabins, were modified to satisfy Combined Fleet's desire to have the ship equipped as the primary flagship of the commander-in-chief, as her sister Yamato was too far along for such changes. These alterations, along with improvements in the <b>secondary</b> <b>battery</b> armour, pushed back completion and pre-handover testing of Musashi by two months, to August 1942.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Capelle, {{the deputy}} {{director}} of the Reichsmarineamt, stated that by mid November 1906, the testing for the underwater protection designs would be complete. He suggested that if the torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship might be too heavy for the 28cm(11in) guns, if the displacement of around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, even if it meant increasing the displacement of the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a <b>secondary</b> <b>battery</b> of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight would have made it impossible to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the return}} to German waters, Helgoland and Thüringen, along with the s Nassau, , and , took up {{defensive}} positions in the Jade roadstead for the night.

The Oldenburg was hit by a shell from a <b>secondary</b> <b>battery</b> that killed 8 and wounded 14 men.

5|$|Iéna was a pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy. The ship's keel {{was laid}} in 1898 {{and she was}} completed four years later.

She participated in the annual fleet manoeuvers and made many visits to French ports in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Losing {{power and}} speed, Roma {{began to fall}} out of the battle group. Around 16:02, another Fritz X slammed into the {{starboard}} side of Romas deck, between frames 123 and 136. It most likely detonated in the forward engine room, sparking flames, and causing heavy flooding in the magazines of main battery turret number two and the fore port side <b>secondary</b> <b>battery</b> turret, and putting even more pressure upon the previously stressed hull girder. Seconds after the initial blast, the number two 15-inch turret was blown over the side by a massive explosion, this time from the detonation of that turret's magazines.|$|E
