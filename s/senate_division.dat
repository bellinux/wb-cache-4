5|$|Seats are {{allocated}} on {{a regional}} basis, {{each of the}} four major regions receives 24seats, and the remainder of the available seats being assigned to smaller regions. The four major regions are Ontario, Quebec, the Maritime provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island), and the Western provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan). The seats for Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut are assigned apart from these regional divisions. The province of Quebec has 24 Senate divisions that are constitutionally mandated. In all other provinces, a <b>Senate</b> <b>division</b> is strictly an optional designation of the senator's own choosing, and has no real constitutional or legal standing. A senator who does not choose a special <b>senate</b> <b>division</b> is considered a senator for the province at large. The distribution of seats has been criticized for not being proportional per region. For example, Ontario has 40 percent of Canada's population but only 24seats, while the smaller Atlantic provinces have a combined 30, and British Columbia, the third most populous province, only has six seats.|$|E

25|$|Canadian <b>Senate</b> <b>{{division}}s</b> {{refers to}} {{two aspects of}} the Canadian Senate. First, {{it refers to the}} division of Canada into four regional <b>Senate</b> <b>divisions</b> of 24 senators each, as set out in the Constitution of Canada (as defined in subsection 52(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982, consisting of the Canada Act 1982 (including the Constitution Act, 1982), all acts and orders referred to in the schedule (including the Constitution Act, 1867, formerly the British North America Act), and any amendments to these documents. The four regions are the Western Provinces, Ontario, Quebec and the Maritimes. These regions are intended to serve the Senate's purpose of providing regional representation in the Parliament of Canada, in contrast to the popular representation that the House of Commons is intended to provide. While not within any of the original four <b>Senate</b> <b>divisions,</b> <b>Senate</b> seats are also allocated to Newfoundland and Labrador and the three territories. The four divisions can be expanded when the need arises to have an extra two senators appointed to each regional division.|$|R

2500|$|Second, {{it refers}} to {{divisions}} within a province represented by senators from the Canadian Senate, also known as [...] "senatorial designation". Under the Constitution, only Quebec has official Senate divisions {{for each of the}} senatorial designations within the province. In all other provinces, Senators are appointed to represent the province as a whole and the Constitution makes no reference to official senatorial designations for those provinces. Senators from provinces outside Quebec may simply [...] "designate" [...] a district they wish to symbolically represent within their province, which can be named {{at the time of their}} appointment or at a later time. These senate divisions have no specific geographic boundaries though their names often give a reference to a general geographic area. However a senator will sometimes create boundaries for their <b>senate</b> <b>division</b> even though it has no legal status. [...] While relatively rare, a senator outside of Quebec can change his or her division in the same manner as party affiliation, simply by notifying the Clerk of the Senate.|$|E

In June 2000, he sat as an Independent Conservative senator, and in October 2000 he became the only Canadian Alliance senator. Since the Canadian Alliance formed the Official Opposition in the House of Commons, St. Germain argued that he should be the Leader of the Official Opposition in the Senate, but his arguments were rejected by the Speaker. At the request of Canadian Alliance Leader Stephen Harper, St. Germain led the negotiations to unite the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party.
