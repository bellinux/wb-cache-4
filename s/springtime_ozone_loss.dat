40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{barrier to}} meridional mixing {{at the edge}} of the Antarctic spring stratospheric vortex is examined. Diagnostics are presented which demonstrate the link between the shape of the meridional mixing barrier {{at the edge of}} the vortex and the meridional gradients in total column ozone across the vortex edge. Results derived from reanalysis and measurement data sets are compared with equivalent diagnostics from five coupled chemistry-climate models to test how well the models capture the interaction between the dynamical structure of the stratospheric vortex and the chemical processes occurring within the vortex. Results show that the accuracy of the simulation of the dynamical vortex edge varies widely amongst the models studied here. This affects the ability of the models to simulate the large observed meridional gradients in total column ozone. Three of the models in this study simulated the inner edge of the vortex to be more than 7 &deg; closer to the pole than observed. This is expected to have important implications for how well these models simulate the extent of severe <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> that occurs within the Antarctic vortex...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThree-dimensional {{chemical}} transport models (CTMs) and coupled chemistry-climate models (CCMs) {{have been widely}} used to study the dynamical and chemical processes which control polar ozone depletion. Despite generally good agreement between modelled and observed loss, there are still some uncertainties in our understanding and limitations of the models. For example, the accuracy of modelled <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> depends critically on the transport, chemistry and treatment of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). There is also increasing evidence that descent of NOx from the mesosphere can impact ozone at high latitudes, {{even in the absence of}} halogen-catalysed loss. CCMs used for future predictions need to accurately include these processes. At the time of writing (late February 2016) the current Arctic winter has been cold with extensive PSC ac- tivity. The local maximum modelled O 3 loss is currently ∼ 50 % (www. see. leeds. ac. uk/tomcat), which is similar to that from previous cold years with record ozone depletion (e. g. 2010 / 11). This is interesting in its own right, but will also provide new meteorological conditions under which to test modelled loss against observations. We will present results from the TOMCAT/SLIMCAT off-line 3 -D CTM and the NCAR Whole Atmo- sphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), which we have recently extended by including mesospheric ion chemistry. Both models are forced or nudged by the ECMWF ERA-Interim 4 D-var reanalyses. First we will focus on the cold Arctic winter/spring 2015 / 16 and quantify the amount of chemical ozone loss using both models and satellite observations. Then we will investigate the chorine activation and denitrification as well as mesospheric NOx/HOx impact on stratospheric ozone. Other sensitivities experiments will be also discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSystematic {{ground-based}} {{measurements of}} the ozone and aerosol stratospheric profile performed in the Dumont d'Urville (66. 4 °S, 140 °E) Antarctic station are used to study the air subsidence in fall, the <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss,</b> and the vortex confinement on an interannual basis. The data obtained mostly from March to October in the 1992 – 1998 time period are analyzed {{as a function of}} equivalent latitude in order to discriminate the measurements performed inside, at the edge or outside the vortex. The subsidence rate derived from the ozone measurements in the lower stratosphere prior to the destruction period and from the volcanic aerosol measurements in 1992 is in good agreement with the estimation provided by radiative transfer models. The analysis of the ozone seasonal variation shows that the ozone destruction starts in the beginning of August and affects essentially the inner vortex or inner edge regions. The destruction lasts up to the end of September and low ozone values are found up to the end of October, confirming the isolation of the polar vortex above 400 K. Ozone destruction rates of the order of 3 %/d in the 400 – 475 K region and 1. 5 %/d around 550 K are derived from the data obtained inside the vortex. The ozone measurements obtained in October allow to study the vortex confinement which shows the increase of the ozone meridional gradient through the vortex edge from 400 to 650 K. A fine view of the vortex edge is provided by a near daily series of aerosol lidar measurements performed in October 1992, a period when the vortex was deformed by planetary waves and slanted with respect to the vertical direction...|$|E

Based on this relationship, the effect of year-to-year variations in vortex dynamics has been filtered out. This process results in an ozone time series that shows increasing <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> over the Antarctic until the mid- 1990 s.

A trajectory cloud–chemistry model {{is used to}} study how volcanic aerosols could affect <b>springtime</b> Arctic <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> processes, such as chlorine activation and denitrification, in a cold winter within the current range of natural variability. Several studies indicate that severe denitrification can increase Arctic <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> by up to 30 %. We show large PSC particles that cause denitrification in a nonvolcanic stratosphere cannot efficiently form in a volcanic environment. However, volcanic aerosols, when present at low altitudes, where Arctic PSCs cannot form, can extend the vertical range of chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in the lower stratosphere.

These {{studies were carried out}} in a photochemical box model, a one-dimensional model without transport and in a two-dimensional photochemical-dynamical-radiation model. The photochemical studies have investigated inter alia the sensitivity of ozone to inclusion in the model of heterogeneous chemistry, and to the inclusion of the ClO dimer. When both of these are incorporated in the model, ozone depletions resembling whose found in Halley Bay in 1987 (J. C. Farman, Nature, 329, 1987) can be reproduced. The temporal variations (both diurnal and during the August to October period) of a number of important tracers including HCl, ClONO 2, OClO and BrO are discussed.

40|$|On 11 $^{th}$ February, 1997, the TRIPLE balloon was {{launched}} in Kiruna, Northern Sweden. It ascended into the lower stratosphere, reached a maximum altitude of 24. 1 km and landed in Northern Finland after a 2. 5 -hour flight. Thanks to advantageous meteorological conditions the balloon passed through the edge region of the polar vortex. Moreover, the data of the TRIPLE flight show that on that day a wave event occurred. The edge region of the polar vortex is of interest because {{the phenomenon of the}} polar vortex is closely related to the <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>loss,</b> also known as the ozone hole. Under certain circumstances, the air inside the vortex is forced to remain under polar night conditions for a period of months. Due to the low temperatures reactive chlorine compounds are formed. After the return of sunlight in springtime especially the ClO radical acts as a catalyst of massive ozone depletion. The stability of the polar vortex and the action of the vortex edge as a transport barrier are decisive factors for the extent of ozone depletion. On the gondola of the TRIPLE balloon several instruments were mounted for the measurement of various molecules, among them the ClO/BrO instrument of Research Centre Jülich, an ozone sounding device from the University of Wyoming and the BONBON cryosampler from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main. Consequently it was possible to simultaneously observe the wave event and its consequences for the chemistry in the air masses in question. The measured ClO profile thus acted as an indicator of the lowest temperature experienced by the respective air parcel during the event. As the most probable simultaneous explanation for the observed ClO, temperature and pressure profiles a wave standing perpendicular to the earth’s surface is suggested. Chemistry and transport calculations by means of the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) support this assumption. A theoretical examination shows that such an event can cause horizontal mixing processes. Indeed, the ozone profile measured on the TRIPLE gondola provides indications of an intrusion of ozone-rich air masses originating from the outer vortex edge area or even from outside the polar vortex. This assumption was verified by the tracer-tracer method utilizing the N 2 O profile of the BONBON cryosampler. Besides these theoretical examinations and considerations, this work also contains a practical part. The working principle of the ClO/BrO instrument, the Chemical Conversion and Resonance Fluorescence (CCRF) method, is explained. The calibration of the instrument and difficulties in measuring BrO by the CCRF method are discussed. Moreover, studies are presented relating {{to the development of the}} HALOX aircraft instrument, a modified version of the balloon instrument which has been operated since the end of 2001 on board the Russian high-altitude research aircraft "Geophysica"...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} the stratospheric sulfate aerosol layer {{associated}} with the Mt. Pinatubo volcano and future volcanic eruptions on {{the recovery of the}} ozone layer is studied with an interactive two-dimensional photochemical model. The time varying chlorine loading and the stratospheric cooling due to increasing carbon dioxide have been taken into account. The computed ozone and temperature changes associated with the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in 1991 agree well with observations. Long model runs out to the year 2050 have been carried out, in which volcanoes having the characteristics of the Mount Pinatubo volcano were erupted in the model at 10 -year intervals starting in the year 2010. Compared to a non-volcanic run using background aerosol loading, transient reductions of globally averaged column ozone of 2 - 3 percent were computed as a result of each of these eruptions, with the ozone recovering to that computed for the non-volcanic case in about 5 years after the eruption. Computed <b>springtime</b> Arctic column <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> of from 10 to 18 percent also recovered to the non-volcanic case within 5 years. These results suggest that the long-term recovery of ozone would not be strongly affected by infrequent volcanic eruptions with a sulfur loading approximating Mt. Pinatubo. Sensitivity studies in which the Arctic lower stratosphere was forced to be 4 K and 10 K colder resulted in transient <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> of which also recovered to the non-volcanic case in 5 years.

Finally, in order to simulate a situation in which frequent smaller volcanic eruptions result in increasing the background sulfate loading, a simulation was made in which the background aerosol was increased by 10 percent per year.

40|$|Possible {{causes of}} a future {{increase}} in stratospheric H 2 O are increasing tropospheric methane levels and a rise in tropospheric H- 2 due to leakages from a possible increased integration of hydrogen into the energy supply system. Here we quantify the direct chemical impact of potential future stratospheric H 2 O increases on Arctic <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> using the cold Arctic winter 2004 / 2005 {{as the basis for}} our study. We present simulations with the three-dimensional chemistry transport model CLaMS using enhanced stratospheric H 2 O values. Previous studies emphasized that increasing H 2 O concentrations cause stratospheric cooling, and some have suggested that this could significantly increase halogen-induced polar <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> The impact of both increased stratospheric H 2 O values and decreased temperatures on simulated ozone depletion is investigated. Assuming an average increase of water vapor in the lower polar stratosphere of approximate to 0. 58 ppmv (averaged over equivalent latitudes >= 65 degrees N, from 400 - 550 K potential temperature and from December to March) and in addition decreased temperatures (- 0. 2 K) yields at most 6. 8 DU (approximate to 11 %) more accumulated <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in mid-March for the Arctic polar winter 2004 / 2005 compared to the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> for undisturbed conditions.

The Arctic mean March total column ozone increases throughout the 21 st century {{at a rate}} of ~ 11. 5 DU decade- 1, and is projected to return to the 1980 level in the late 2030 s. However, the integrations show that even past 2060 <b>springtime</b> Arctic <b>ozone</b> can episodically drop by ~ 50 - 100 DU below the corresponding long-term ensemble mean for that period, reaching values characteristic of the near present day average level. Consistent with the global decline in inorganic chlorine (Cly) over the century, the estimated mean halogen induced chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in the Arctic lower atmosphere in spring decreases by around a factor of two between 1981 - 2000 and 2061 - 2080. However, {{in the presence of a}} cold and strong polar vortex elevated halogen induced <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> well above the corresponding long-term mean continue to occur in the simulations into the second part of the century. The ensemble shows a significant cooling trend in the Arctic winter mid- and upper stratosphere, but there is less confidence in the projected temperature trends in the lower stratosphere (100 - 50 hPa). This is partly due to an increase in downwelling over the Arctic polar cap in winter, which increases transport of ozone into the polar region as well as drives adiabatic warming that partly offsets the radiatively-driven stratospheric cooling. However, individual winters characterised by significantly suppressed downwelling, reduced transport and anomalously low temperatures continue to occur in the future. We conclude that despite the projected long-term recovery of Arctic ozone, the large interannual dynamical variability is expected to continue in the future, thereby facilitating episodic reductions in <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> columns.

We then analyzed {{the influence of the}} interannual variation of meteorology in simulated results by using the fixed emissions for 2000 and meteorological fields for each year. As a reference parameter, we calculated the area-weighted surface pressure anomaly over the Pacific Ocean east of Japan. When the anomaly has a large negative value, polluted air masses from continental Asia tend to be transported directly to Japan by westerly winds. In contrast, when the anomaly has a large positive value, influence of the outflow from continental Asia tends to be small because the westerly components of wind fields around Japan are comparatively weak. Instead, southerly winds are relatively strong and transport clean air masses from the Pacific Ocean to Japan. Consequently, <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> over Japan is higher (lower) than in ordinary years when the anomaly has a large negative (positive) value.

This theory has been extended to a warming theory of halogenated molecules for climate change. In this comment, we discuss the chemical and physical foundations of these theories and the conclusions derived from the theories. First, it is unclear whether the loss rates of halogenated molecules induced by dissociative electron attachment (DEA) observed in the laboratory can also be interpreted as atmospheric loss rates, but even if this were the case, the impact of DEA-induced reactions on polar chlorine activation and <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in the stratosphere is limited. Second, we falsify several conclusions that are reported on the basis of the CRE theory: There is no polar <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in darkness, there is no apparent 11 -year periodicity in polar total ozone measurements, the age of air in the polar lower stratosphere is much older than 1 – 2 years, and the reported detection of a pronounced recovery (by about 20 – 25 %) in Antarctic total ozone measurements by the year 2010 is in error. There are also conclusions about the future development of sea ice and global sea level which are fundamentally flawed because Archimedes' principle is neglected. Many elements of the CRE theory are based solely on correlations between certain datasets which are no substitute for providing physical and chemical mechanisms causing a particular behavior noticeable in observations.

This study further demonstrates the interaction between meteorology and <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> The connection between temperature conditions and chlorine activation, and in turn, the connection between chlorine activation and <b>ozone</b> <b>loss,</b> becomes obvious in the HALOE HCl measurements. Additionally, the degree of homogeneity of <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> within the vortex was shown to depend on the meteorological conditions. Results derived here are in general agreement with the results obtained by other methods for deducing polar <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> Differences occur mainly owing to different time periods considered in deriving accumulated <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> However, very strong <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> as deduced from SAOZ for January in winters 1993 - 1994 and 1995 - 1996 cannot be identified using available HALOE observations in the early winter.

Moreover, at altitudes above 470 K, accumulated <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> depends on the amount of PSCs occurring during winter and spring. During September, ozone mixing ratios show a large day to day variation.

40|$|In 1985, {{there was}} a report of a large, sudden, and unanticipated {{decrease}} in the abundance of <b>springtime</b> Antarctic <b>ozone</b> over the last decade. By 1987, ozone decreases of more than 50 percent in the total column, and 95 percent locally between 15 and 20 km, had been observed. The scientific community quickly rose to the challenge of explaining this remarkable discovery; theoreticians soon developed a series of chemical and dynamical hypotheses to explain the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> Three basic theories were proposed to explain the <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> hole. (1) The ozone hole is caused by the increasing atmospheric loadings of manmade chemicals containing chlorine (chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) and bromine (halons)). These chemicals efficiently destroy ozone in the lower stratosphere in the Antarctic because of the special geophysical conditions, of an isolated air mass (polar vortex) with very cold temperatures, that exist there. (2) The circulation of the atmosphere in spring has changed from being predominantly downward over Antarctica to upward. This would mean that ozone poor air from the troposphere, instead of ozone rich air from the upper stratosphere, would be transported into the lower Antarctic stratosphere. (3) The abundance of the oxides of nitrogen in the lower Antarctic stratosphere is periodically enhanced by solar activity. Nitrogen oxides are produced in the upper mesosphere and thermosphere and then transported downward into the lower stratosphere in Antarctica, resulting in the chemical destruction of ozone. The climatology and trends of ozone, temperature, and polar stratospheric clouds are discussed. Also, the transport and chemical theories for the Antarctic ozone hole are presented...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{chemical}} <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in the Arctic stratosphere was investigated {{for twelve years}} between 1991 and 2003. The accumulated local <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> and the column <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> were consistently derived mainly {{on the basis of}} HALOE observations. The ozone-tracer correlation (TRAC) method is used, where the relation between ozone and a long-lived tracer is considered over the lifetime of the polar vortex. A detailed quantification of uncertainties was performed. This study demonstrates the interaction between meteorology and <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> The correlation between temperature conditions and chlorine activation becomes obvious in the HALOE HCl measurements, as well as the dependence between chlorine activation and <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> Additionally, the degree of homogeneity of <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> is shown to depend on the meteorological conditions, as there is a possible influence of horizontal mixing of the air inside a weak polar vortex edge. Results estimated here are in agreement with the results obtained from other methods. However, {{there is no sign of}} very strong <b>ozone</b> <b>losses</b> as deduced from SAOZ for January considering HALOE measurements. In general, strong accumulated <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> is found to occur in conjunction with a strong cold vortex containing a large potential area of PSCs, whereas moderate <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> is found if the vortex is less strong and moderately warm. Hardly any <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> was calculated for very warm winters with small amounts of the area of possible PSC existence (A PSC) during the entire winter. Nevertheless, the analysis of the relationship between A PSC (derived using the PSC threshold temperature) and the accumulated <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> indicates that this relationship is not a strictly linear relation. An influence of other factors could be identified. A significant increase of <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> (of ? 40 DU) was found due to the different duration of illumination of the polar vortex in different years. Further, the increased burden of aerosols in the atmosphere after the Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991 and the location of the cold parts of the vortex in different years may impact the extent of chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Match {{method for}} {{quantification}} of polar chemical <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> is investigated mainly {{with respect to}} the impact of mixing across the vortex edge onto this estimate. We show for the winter 2002 / 03 that significant mixing across the vortex edge occurred and was accurately modeled by the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere. Observations of inert tracers and ozone in-situ from HAGAR on the Geophysica aircraft and sondes and also remote from MIPAS on ENVISAT were reproduced well. The model even reproduced a small vortex remnant that was isolated until June 2003 and was observed in-situ by a balloon-borne whole air sampler. We use this CLaMS simulation to quantify the impact of cross vortex edge mixing on the results of the Match method. It is shown that a time integration of the determined vortex average <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates as performed in Match results in larger <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> than the polar vortex average <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> in CLaMS. Also, the determination of the Match <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates can be influenced by mixing. This is especially important below 430 K, where ozone outside the vortex is lower than inside and the vortex boundary is not a strong transport barrier. This effect and further sampling effects cause an offset between vortex average <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates derived from Match and deduced from CLaMS with an even sampling for the entire vortex. Both, the time-integration of <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> and the determination of <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates for Match are evaluated using the winter 2002 / 03 CLaMS simulation. These impacts can explain the differences between CLaMS and Match column <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> While the investigated effects somewhat reduce the apparent discrepancy in January <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates, a discrepancy between simulations and Match remains.

Analyzing an ensemble of historical integrations with all known natural and anthropogenic forcings specified over the period 1955 – 2005, we find that extremely low stratospheric ozone changes are able to produce large and robust anomalies in tropospheric wind, temperature and precipitation in April and May over large portions of the Northern Hemisphere (most notably over the North Atlantic and Eurasia). Further, these ozone-induced surface anomalies are obtained {{only in the last}} two decades of the 20 th century, when high concentrations of ozone depleting substances generate sufficiently strong stratospheric temperature anomalies to impact the surface climate.

However, the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> begins earlier in the 2002 - 2003 winter, with significant ozone depletion by early January.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a sensitivity analysis of multi-variate regressions of recent <b>springtime</b> Antarctic vortex <b>ozone</b> trends using a "big data" ensemble approach. Multi-variate regression methods {{are widely used}} for studying the variability and detection of ozone trends. Based on multi-variate regression analysis of total Antarctic <b>springtime</b> vortex <b>ozone</b> {{it has been suggested}} that the observed increase of ozone since the late 1990 s is statistically significant and can be attributed to decreasing stratospheric halogens (Salby et al., 2011, 2012; Kuttippurath et al., 2013). We find that, when considering uncertainties that have not been addressed in these studies, this conclusion on ozone recovery is not warranted. An ensemble of regressions is constructed based on the analysis of uncertainties in the applied ozone record as well as of uncertainties in the various applied regressors. The presented combination of ensemble members spans up the uncertainty range with about 35 million different regressions. The poleward heat flux (Eliassen–Palm Flux) and the effective chlorine loading explain, respectively, most of the short-term and long-term variability in different Antarctic <b>springtime</b> total <b>ozone</b> records. The inclusion in the regression of stratospheric volcanic aerosols, solar variability, the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode is shown to increase rather than to decrease the overall uncertainty in the attribution of Antarctic <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> because of large uncertainties in their respective records. Calculating the trend significance for the ozone record from the late 1990 s onwards solely based on the fit of the effective chlorine loading should be avoided, as this does not take fit residuals into account and thereby results in too narrow uncertainty intervals. When taking fit residuals into account, we find that less than 30 % of the regressions in the full ensemble result in a statistically significant positive <b>springtime</b> <b>ozone</b> trend over Antarctica from the late 1990 s to either 2010 or 2012. Analysis of choices and uncertainties in time series show that, depending on choices in time series and parameters, the fraction of statistically significant trends in parts of the ensemble can range from negligible to more than 90 %.

40|$|Uncertainties of the {{photolysis}} {{cross sections}} of ClOOCl {{have long been}} a limiting factor in our theoretical understanding of the rate of polar stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>losses.</b> Previous work suggested that values slightly larger than current recommendations, {{which are based on}} laboratory measurements, result in improved agreement be- tween model calculations of polar stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates and observations {{while at the same time}} also leading to improved agreement between observations of the diurnal variation of ClO and model calculations of this species. But new laboratory work (Pope et al, 2007) on the cross sections of ClOOCl suggest that its photolysis under polar stratospheric winter/spring conditions is nearly an order of magnitude slower than what would be required to explain the observations of <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> and ClO in the atmosphere and a factor of six slower than a value based on the current recommendations. We show what the impact of these new results on our understand- ing of polar ozone chemistry is. In model calculations that are based on the new cross sections and for typical Arctic conditions ratios of ClO/ClOx decrease by about a factor of two. The <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rate by the ClO-dimer cycle, so far believed to be the most efficient <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> cycle, drops by about a factor of four and the loss rate by the coupled ClO-BrO cycle by nearly a factor of two.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was a {{quantitative}} test of the current understanding of the stratospheric ozone chemistry in the Arctic winter. For that purpose box model studies corresponding to the match analyses of the winters 1991 / 92 and 1994 / 95 were carried out. The Match technique allows {{the determination of the}} chemically induced <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> from a statistical analysis of pairs of ozonesonde measurements that took place at different times and locations of a calculated air mass trajectory. Under twilight conditions, as they are typical for the polar winter, the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rate strongly varies with the solar zenith angle. Thus it was necessary to simulate the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> along each of the match trajectories to obtain results quantitatively comparable to the match analyses. In order to obtain initial values for these model runs the seasonal development of the relevant trace gas mixing ratios was simulated using idealized trajectories. It could be shown that the model significantly underestimates the early winter <b>ozone</b> <b>loss.</b> The match dataset of the winter 1991 / 92 allows a time dependent comparison of the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates only on the 475 K potential temperature level (#approx# 19 km). From mid February on the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates are well reproduced by the model. But during the period of maximum <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates, from mid January to mid February, the modeled values are considerably lower than the match results. Extensive sensitivity studies show that this discrepancy can not be explained by uncertainties of model parameters. For the winter 1994 / 95, the height dependence of the <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates could also be examined. The <b>ozone</b> <b>loss</b> rates simulated for early winter 1994 / 95 agree well with the Match results for potential temperatures below 475 K 171 refs.
