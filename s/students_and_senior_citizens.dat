40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This Economic and Social Research Council New Security Challenges small grant project examined the framing of terrorist threats in Russian elections (2003 Duma and 2004 presidential) and the United States (US) presidential election in 2004. The project examined coverage of the nightly news during the campaigns, messages from political parties and candidates as well as audience reaction in focus groups in each country. Ten focus groups were held in Russia {{in the spring of}} 2004 in Moscow and Ulyanovsk. They were conducted and transcribed in Russian. There were an average of eight participants in each group, which were divided by age. Eleven focus groups were held in the US, which were conducted and transcribed in English. They were held in Missouri (Columbia), Florida (Cleremont, Gainesville and St. Petersburg) and the Washington DC area. The groups had an average of 10 participants and were divided into <b>student,</b> adult <b>and</b> <b>senior</b> <b>citizen</b> groups. The groups in both countries discussed media use, the coverage of terrorism in the mass media and the role that security concerns (including terrorism) played in their vote choice in the elections. In the US groups, some political advertisments from the John Kerry and George W. Bush general campaign were used to cue the discussion. Across the groups in both countries, anger and fear were expressed about terrorism. In the Russian groups, there was an acceptance of a government response that targeted Chechens in an attempt to control domestic terrorism. While the Russian participants did not make many overt links between terrorism and their vote choice, the notion of a strong president was very important to them. In the US, the doubt and confusion about the value of strength were clearer, yet it was also clear that, like the Russians, this notion of strength was a very important factor in picking Bush over Kerry in the close 2004 US election...|$|R

50|$|The {{hiring of}} local <b>students</b> <b>and</b> <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> {{was always a}} {{challenge}} because of the keen competition of other attractions in the area. To help alleviate that problem, the park entered into an agreement with a Mexican college to hire Mexican students for the summer. The plan quickly fell apart and the park experienced a lot of negative media coverage regarding claims by the students of poor living conditions in their dorms and illegal working conditions. The local unions, who normally booked their picnics at the park, suddenly canceled their lucrative picnic outings due to the allegations and the park began a deep decline in attendance and revenue. By the end of season, attendance reached an all-time low of just under 200,000. The park then learned that its insurance company would only pay $3 million in claims, leaving the park {{to pick up the}} remaining $2 million in expenses. In December, the park was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.|$|E
40|$|Media affects {{our views}} {{of the world and}} plays a large part in {{creation}} and dissemination of social representations. Through media’s increasing importance, people and organizations need to work harder to stand out among the large amounts of brands that exists today. In 2013, Umeå Energi launched a commercial concept about Dolf and Järven, two characters living in Lill-Grobban, a fictional village outside of Umeå. The aim of this qualitative study is to examine how Umeå Energi uses stereotypes in the commercial concept Dolf and Järven and how this affects the respondents, and in the long run the stereotypification of norrlandians. To achieve this aim the following theories have been applied: stereotypes, identity and storytelling. The study was conducted through three focus group interviews with <b>students,</b> professionals <b>and</b> <b>senior</b> <b>citizens,</b> plus one informant interview with a marketer at Umeå Energi. The results and analysis of the study shows that <b>students</b> <b>and</b> professionals thinks the commercials are entertaining, while <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> are of a negative opinion; they believe it’s an outrageous and parodic image of locals represented in the commercials. The study also shows that the dialect of the northern Sweden is a large part in creating the stereotypical local in northern Sweden. Professionals <b>and</b> <b>students</b> have a positive image of Umeå Energi after watching the commercials while <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> are skeptical. Overall, the study's results show large differences in how the commercials about Dolf and Järven is being received by the respondents. <b>Students</b> <b>and</b> professionals think that the commercials are entertaining, while <b>senior</b> <b>citizens</b> disagree. They are of the opinion that the commercials show an exaggerated and negative image of norrlandians.  Medierna påverkar vår världsbild och spelar en stor roll för utformningen och spridningen av sociala representationer. I och med mediernas allt större plats i våra liv ökar behovet hos både människor och organisationer att sticka ut för att synliggöra sig i bruset av alla varumärken som finns. Umeå Energi lanserade 2013 ett reklamkoncept med karaktärerna Dolf och Järven som bor i Lill-Grobban, en fiktiv ort någonstans utanför Umeå. Syftet med denna kvalitativa studie är att undersöka hur Umeå Energi använder sig av en stereotyp bild av norrlänningar i sitt reklamkoncept Dolf och Järven och hur detta påverkar mottagarna, samt i förlängningen även bilden av den stereotypa norrlänningen. Teorierna som används är stereotyper, identitet och storytelling. För studien genomförs tre fokusgruppintervjuer med studenter, yrkesverksamma respektive pensionärer, samt en enskild intervju med marknadsförare på Umeå Energi. Studien visar att studenter och yrkesverksamma upplever reklamfilmerna om Dolf och Järven som underhållande medan pensionärerna är negativt inställda; de anser att det är en överdriven och parodisk bild av norrlänningen som förmedlas. Av studien framgår även att den norrländska dialekten är en stor del i skapandet av den stereotypa norrlänningen. Yrkesverksamma och studenter har en positiv inställning till Umeå Energi efter att ha sett reklamfilmerna medan pensionärerna är skeptiska. Överlag visar studiens resultat stora skillnader i hur reklamfilmerna om Dolf och Järven mottas bland äldre och yngre personer.
