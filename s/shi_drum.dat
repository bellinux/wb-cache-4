40|$|A {{four months}} growth trial {{was carried out}} in order to {{evaluate}} the quality traits of juvenile <b>shi</b> <b>drum</b> (Umbrina cirrosa) fed two isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets having a different EE/NFE ratio (LOW, 0. 7 vs. HIGH, 1. 1). Compared to HIGH diet, LOW one was formulated increasing the replacement of fish oil with cereal products and soybean meal. At the end of the feeding trial (2 replicate per dietary treatment), 26 fish for each thesis were sorted according to live weight and submitted to chemical and sensorial analysis. Dietary treatments showed similar productive performance. The relative high inclusion of carbohydrates in substitution of lipids did not affect proximate composition of whole body and dorsal fillet. Among sensorial traits, LOW diet-fed fish evidenced a significant lower trunk exudation and fillet lightness. Results of this research showed that <b>shi</b> <b>drum</b> is a suitable candidate for Mediterranean marine aquaculture and its dietary formulation might include at least the NFE amount tested in this trial...|$|E
40|$|Insulin-like {{growth factors}} (IGFs) are {{evolutionarily}} ancient polypeptides, with potent metabolic actions, affecting cell development and growth. The IGF system {{consists of two}} ligands: IGF-I and IGF-II, several binding proteins and high-affinity transmembrane receptors. To understand growth regulation in the teleost <b>shi</b> <b>drum,</b> Umbrina cirrosa, we cloned IGF-I and IGF-II cDNAs, studied their expression and determined the cellular localization of IGF-II peptide by immunohistochemistry. A fragment of 1110 nucleotides, coding for U. cirrosa IGF-I (ucIGF-I), was cloned from liver by PCR. It includes an open reading frame of 561 nucleotides, encoding a 187 amino acid preproIGF-I. A fragment of 938 nucleotides that includes part of the coding sequence and the 3 ' UTR of IGF-II (ucIGF-II) was cloned as well. Sequence analysis of ucIGF-I and ucIGF-II showed {{a high degree of}} homology with known fish IGF-I and IGF-II. Real-Time PCR showed a higher expression of IGF-I and IGF-II in liver, compared to all other tissues analysed. IGF-II peptide was detected in larval liver, intestine, gills and heart musculature. After metamorphosis, reactivity was particularly evident in the kidney and in red fibres of skeletal muscle. These results add novel information on the nucleotide sequence of IGF-I and IGF-II in a marine teleost, the <b>shi</b> <b>drum,</b> that was recently introduced to the mariculture industry in southern Europe and emphasizes the conservation in the 5 ' UTR of IGF-I among teleosts. Furthermore, this study suggests, {{on the basis of a}} combined approach of RT-PCR, Real-Time PCR and immunohistochemistry that IGF-I and IGF-II are involved in the regulation of somatic growth in the <b>shi</b> <b>drum...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to characterize the metabolic and antioxidant profile of white muscle of <b>shi</b> <b>drum</b> in two sites of the body, anterior dorsal (AM) and posterior dorsal (PM) portions. In addition, it will be analyzed the possible effect of starvation and a subsequent refeeding, with two different protocols, pair feeding and ad libitum. Activities of key enzymes of intermediary metabolism and of antioxidant enzymes, as well as lipid peroxidation, as an index of oxidative stress, were evaluated. The results indicate the existence of a regional asymmetry of the metabolic capacities of the white muscle of <b>shi</b> <b>drum,</b> which is likely related to the different contribution to swimming of the body regions examined. Starvation induces a metabolic depression that is more marked in those activities that support burst swimming in PM, while those activities supporting maintenance requirements are conserved. The greatest energy demands during starvation appear to lie in AM, which showed the highest oxidative metabolism rate. The increased use of fatty acids as energy source for AM leads to oxidative stress. A period of more than four weeks of refeeding for full restoration of metabolic capacities in AM is needed, probably related to the higher muscle mass located in this region. On the contrary, all enzyme activities in PM returned to control levels in both refeeding protocols, but pair feeding seems to be advantageous since compensatory growth has been taking place without signs of oxidative stress. This work was addressed to gain knowledge on the physiology of a promising fish species in aquaculture like <b>shi</b> <b>drum.</b> The results displayed here show how the starving and further re-feeding events could generate oxidative stress situations characterized by high lipid peroxidation levels which may influence negatively {{on the quality of the}} edible part of the fish. This study opens an interesting field on this fish species which deserves being investigated in the future. Versión del edito...|$|E

40|$|<b>Shi</b> <b>drum</b> (Umbrina cirrosa L.) is a {{suitable}} candidate for Mediterranean (marine) aquaculture {{because of its}} very fast growth in captivity. However, nutritional requirements of this Sciaenidae are not known. Thus, two complete extruded isoproteic diets with different crude fat to N-free extract ratio (CF/NFE: L= 1. 0 vs. H= 1. 5) were tested in juvenile <b>shi</b> <b>drum</b> to evaluate productive performances and quality traits of the final product. Experimental trial was conducted over summer 2001 using 4 groups of 200 fish (IBW = 83  25 g) fed 2 % BW. Growth parameters and feed efficiency were recorded and fish were submitted to morphometric, chemical and reological analysis. Considering a 4 months feeding period L-diet fed fish showed a significant greater weight gain than H-fed fish due to a higher specific growth rate (SGR) and a lower food conversion ratio (FCR). Chemical composition of whole body fish resulted in higher crude protein and lower lipids contents for animals of L-diet thesis. This suggests that the better rearing performances obtained with fish fed the low CF/NFE kind of diet are probably related to a more efficient utilization of dietary energy and/or crude protein. The main morphometric traits and textural properties of fish considered {{at the end of}} the study were not affected by dietary CF/NFE ratio...|$|E

40|$|A four-month growth {{trial was}} carried out in order to {{evaluate}} performance and quality traits of juvenile <b>shi</b> <b>drum</b> fed with two isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets having different amounts of vegetable products (Vegetable diet vs. Control diet). Compared to the Control diet, the Vegetable diet was formulated by increasing the replacement of fish meal (14 %) with soybean and cereal products, and fish oil (12 %) with a mixture of vegetable oil. On June, 4 groups of 225 fish (2 replicates per dietary treatment) were sorted according to live weight and reared in fibreglass tanks over a four- month long experimental period. Fish were hand fed to apparent satiety. Offered feed, growth parameters and feed efficiency were recorded as productive performance. At the end of the trial (October) biometric, chemical and reological traits were examined to assess fish quality. The dietary treatments showed similar productive performance. The relatively high inclusion of vegetable sources led to a significant modification of body shape, mesenteric fat and viscera weight. Among quality traits, Vegetable diet-fed fish demonstrated a significantly lower whole body and fillet crude protein content. Yellowness value of the cooked fillet was significantly lower in the Control diet-fed fish, whereas fillet texture was similar. The results of this research showed that <b>shi</b> <b>drum</b> is a suitable candidate for Mediterranean marine aquaculture and its dietary formulation might include at least the amount of vegetable sources used in this trial...|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{biology of}} the <b>shi</b> <b>drum</b> (Umbrina cirrosa) in culture was histologically exam- ined and sperm quality was monitored during an entire reproductive period. Already in April, the ovary contained oocytes in {{all stages of}} maturation, from primary oocytes to full vitellogenesis, as expected from a group-synchronous multiple-batch spawning fish. Vitellogenesis of the first batch of oocytes occurred very rapidly and their mean diameter (500 μm) did not increase sig- nificantly (p> 0. 05) as the reproductive period proceeded. The spermiation index peaked in May- June, but fish never produced copious amounts of milt upon abdominal pressure. The sperma- tozoa motility percentage remained unchanged throughout the spawning season (80 %) and a significant percentage (40 %) maintained viability after overnight storage at 4 °C. Sperm density and motility duration increased during the reproductive period and varied 13 - 26 x 109 spermato- zoa/ml and 26 - 40 s, respectively. Spontaneous spawning was not observed during the two-year study. Injection of post-vitellogenic females with an agonist of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRHa) was successful in inducing a single spawning after two days, with fertilization, hatch- ing and 4 -day larval survival rates of 65 %, 42 - 76 % and 46 - 80 %, respectively. The results under- line the failure of female <b>shi</b> <b>drum</b> in culture to undergo final oocyte maturation and, although GnRHa injection was effective in inducing spawning of viable eggs, multiple treatments did not induce multiple spawns, as was expected from fish with multiple-batch group-synchronous ovar- ian biology...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of phthalate esters in freshwater and marine aquacultural species like rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and <b>shi</b> <b>drum</b> Umbrina cirrosa, respectively, {{were determined by}} immunohistochemical approach. The results showed a similar distribution in the gastrointestinal tract of both species. In particular, intense immunoreactivity was found at gastric gland level. In the intestinal tract, goblet cells failed to stain, whereas enterocytes showed the highest binding of phthalates restricted to the apical cytoplasm. This distribution of phthalate esters at gastric gland and enterocyte level may have implications for the physiology of the digestive process and intestinal biotransformation. Phthalates are confirmed to be widely diffused contaminants, absorbed via the alimentary canal; thus a multidisciplinary approach could be useful to examine sea and freshwater environments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{study of}} mucosal surfaces, and in {{particular}} the fish skin and its secreted mucus, has been of great interest recently among immunologists. Measurement of the viscosity and other physico-chemical parameters (protein concentration, pH, conductivity, redox potential, osmolality and density) of the skin mucus can help to understand its biological functions. We have used five marine species of teleost: gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.), European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.), <b>shi</b> <b>drum</b> (Umbrina cirrosa L.), common dentex (Dentex dentex L.) and dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus L.), all of them with commercial interest in the aquaculture of the Mediterranean area. Mucus showed a direct shear- and temperaturedependent viscosity, with a non-Newtonian behavior, which differed however between two groups: one with higher viscosity (D. labrax, U. cirrosa, D. dentex) and the other with lower viscosity (S. aurata, E. marginatus). In addition, there was a clear interrelation between density and osmolality, as well as between density and temperature. Taking into account that high values of viscosity should improve the barrier effect against pathogens but low values of viscosity are needed for good locomotion characteristics, our results may help elucidate the relationship between physico-chemical and biological parameters of skin mucus, and disease susceptibility.

Nine new isolates were identified and their sequences were combined with sequences in the literature to produce three different data sets. The first set, based on amino acid sequences, was used to verify the monophyly of fish nodaviruses. The second and third data sets, based on nucleic acids, were used to resolve the phylogenetic relationships between closely related fish nodaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses were performed according to the maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods. Our results support the monophyly of fish nodaviruses. Moreover, they confirm the subdivision of fish nodaviruses into four main clusters, {{in agreement with the}} previously suggested phylogeny of the genus Piscinodavirus, that was based on a smaller number of sequences and an alternative phylogenetic approach [14].

40|$|Productive {{performances}} of triploid (3 n) and diploid (2 n) <b>shi</b> <b>drum</b> (Umbrina cirrosa L.) were evaluated over an experimental period of 76 days. Fish, selected according to body weight (196 specimens from each ploidy), were reared in tanks (two for each thesis) {{under the same}} environmental and dietary conditions. A practical extruded diet (crude protein: 43. 4 %; ether extract: 19. 3 %) was offered to fish according to a feeding rate that varied from 1 % to 1. 5 % of live weight. Both {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the trials, samples of fish were submitted to morphometrics and chemical analysis. The final body weight and the specific growth rate of triploid fish were significantly lower than those of fish diploid. The feed efficiency of triploids showed a reduction in crude protein retention. Juvenile triploids evidenced a larger amount of coelomatic fat, and their gonads were atrophic. The whole-body proximate composition of 3 n fish was characterized by a higher ether extract and a lower crude protein content than 2 n fish. Triploids had higher liver lipid content; there were no significant differences in viscera proximate composition. Sum, the results showed that chromosome set manipulation in this species can reduce productive performances at a juvenile stage, influencing some morphometric traits...|$|E
40|$|Carcass and £esh morphometric, reological and {{chemical}} traits of triploid (3 n) and diploid (2 n) <b>shi</b> <b>drum</b> (Umbrina cirrosa L.) were evaluated through 7 months. Three age groups, 17 -, 21 - and 24 -monthold fish, were investigated. The effects of ploidy were statistically evaluated {{and the weight}} of fish was included in the model as a covariate because triploids grew less than diploids. As expected, fish weight was found to be significantly correlatedwith all the investigated morphometric traits, but showed a negative correlation with some chemical (pH) and colour traits (lightness) of raw fillet. In comparison with controls, triploid shi drums were characterized by di¡erent morphological traits that involved a slender body shape. In triploids, a reduction in condition factor, backboneweight, dressing index and an increase in the agility index were also recorded. When the commercial size (i. e. over 300 g) was achieved, triploids exhibited larger coelomatic and fillet (dorsal whitemuscle) fat deposition than diploids. Among reological traits, colour and texture were a¡ected by ploidy; raw fillet lightness and cooked £esh tenderness were higher among triploids in all the investigated age groups. As fish were fed with a restricted feeding regimen, fillet fat deposition was supposed to be limited. Thus, the effects of ploidy on reological traits may be only partially explained by lipid fillet amount and are supposed to bemore related to di¡erent fibre muscle architecture...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} of spawning induction in <b>shi</b> <b>drum,</b> Umbrina cirrosa L., {{were performed}} in six different commercial Italian hatcheries from May to August (water temperatures: 19 - 29 °C; salinity: 21 - 37 p. p. t.). In the first experiment, 119 females (1 - 4. 7 kg), subdivided into 29 lots, were injected {{with a single}} dose (2, 5, 8, 10, 15 and 20 μg kg- 1 body weight) of short-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa-S), des-Gly 10,[D-Ala 6]-LH-RH ethylamide. In the other two experiments, 85 females (0. 7 - 5. 8 kg), subdivided into 22 and four lots, were treated with one (40 or 80 μg kg- 1) or three doses (40 μg kg- 1) of long-acting GnRHa (GnRHa-L), respectively. GnRHa-S stimulated spawning in 69 % of the 29 treated lots; the number of eggs laid reached a maximum of 130 000 and a weighted mean of 29 200 total eggs kg- 1. GnRHa-L elicited a spawning response in 95 % of the 22 one-dose treated lots; the number of laid eggs was higher than with GnRHa-S, reaching a maximum of 213 100 and a weighted mean of 59 400 total eggs kg- 1. The yield of developing embryos in 67 % of the single GnRHa-L treatments was higher (sometimes up to three times) than with GnRHa-S. Triple treatments of the four lots of females with GnRHa-L always resulted in spawning responses; the best result corresponded {{to a number of}} total laid eggs of 358 900 eggs kg- 1 with a yield of 177 300 developing embryos...|$|E

At 11. 8 and 20 months of age, the body growth and the muscle parameters reached the highest values in the 24 L and 12 L: 12 D groups. The 16 L: 8 D group showed the lowest growth. When comparing 24 L with 12 L: 12 D, the highest number of white fibres was found in the 24 L group, whereas the greatest fibres size was reached in the 12 L: 12 D group. Commercial size (28 - 30 cm; 290 - 340 g) was reached at 20 months of age in the 24 L and 12 L: 12 D groups, but at 23 months in the 16 L: 8 D group. When comparing the three groups at the commercial stage, the larval photoperiod effect was still observed, such that the highest fibres number was again found in the 24 L group, whereas the greatest fibres size was reached in the 12 L: 12 D group. The highest values of textural hardness were observed in the 16 L: 8 D and 24 L groups.

40|$|A {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} (PCR) -based assay to detect nervous necrosis virus (NNV) in fish was developed by using two sets of primers designed on a highly conserved region of the coat protein gene encoded by RNA 2 of NNV. The first pair of primers amplified a fragment of 605 bp by one-step reverse-transcription (RT) -PCR, while the second pair amplified an internal segment of 255 bp by nested PCR. Addition of nested PCR increased the assay sensitivity 100 -fold when carried out in a separate tube (two-step assay) and 10 -fold when performed in the same tube (one-step assay). The sensitivity of the two-step assay was 104 times {{higher than that of}} virus cultivation. Nested PCR served also to confirm the specificity of the first amplification, as verified also by Southern hybridization analysis and direct sequencing. In species known to be susceptible to infection, such as European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, and gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata, NNV was often detectable in brain tissue by RT-PCR alone but only by the two-step assay in blood, sperm, ovarian tissue or larvae. The same was true for sperm and ovarian tissue of <b>shi</b> <b>drum,</b> Umbrina cirrosa. NNV was also detected in the brains of Japanese red seabream, Pagrus major and brown meagre, Sciaena umbra, suggesting that these species can also be infected. No NNV was detected in samples of Artemia salina nauplii and rotifers obtained from a fish farm with an NNV outbreak. The inclusion of nested PCR in the assay appears to be necessary to screen out NNV-positive broodfish by blood sampling and testing of their larval progeny...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{skin mucus}} {{contains}} several immune substances {{that provide the}} first line of defence against a broad spectrum of pathogens although they are poorly studied to date. Terminal carbohydrate composition and levels of total IgM antibodies, several immune-related enzymes (lysozyme, peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, esterases, proteases and antiproteases) as well as the bactericidal activity (against fish pathogenic Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio angillarum, Photobacterium damselae and non-pathogenic bacteria Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Shewanella putrefaciens) were identified and measured in the skin mucus of five marine teleosts: gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), <b>shi</b> <b>drum</b> (Umbrina cirrosa), common dentex (Dentex dentex) and dusky grouper (Epinephelus marginatus). First, lectin binding results suggests that skin mucus contain, in order of abundance, N-acetylneuraminic acid, glucose, N-acetyl-glucosamine, N-acetyl-galactosamine, galactose and fucose residues. Second, results showed that while some immune activities were very similar in the studied fish (e. g. IgM and lysozyme activity) other such as protease, antiprotease, alkaline phosphatase, esterase and peroxidase activities varied depending on the fish species. High levels of peroxidase and protease activity were found in U. cirrosa respect to the values obtained in the other species while E. marginatus and S. aurata showed the highest levels of alkaline phosphatase and esterase activities, respectively. Moreover, skin mucus of S. aurata revealed higher bactericidal activity against pathogenic bacteria, contrarily, to what happened with non-pathogenic bacteria (E. coli, B. subtilis). Thus, study of the variations in the carbohydrate profile and immune-related components of the fish skin mucus could help to understand the fish resistance as well as the presence and distribution of pathogens and magnitude of infections, aspects that are of major importance for the aquaculture industry.

Immunoreactivity of the mitogenic marker PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) was used for assessment of cellular proliferation. Distribution of IGF-I mRNA was studied by in situ hybridization. IGF-I immunoreactivity was detected in liver and developing intestine already in 1 - 5 day post-hatching larvae. From day 11, immunostaining in the intestine {{was evident in the}} enterocytes of the anterior intestine and in the apical zone of the epithelium of developing posterior intestine. Positive reaction with IGF-I antibody was also detected in chondrocytes, in the epithelium of the skin, gills and in the central nervous system (CNS), and lateral muscle. At hatching IGF-IR immunoreactivity was already detectable in developing CNS, notochord, and skin. From day 6 immunostaining was evident in the olfactory epithelium, in eyes and from day 11 in the developing olfactory bulbs and CNS. Positive reaction with IGF-IR antibody was also detected in chondrocytes, in the epithelium of the skin, gills, heart, and in the lateral muscle. Immunoreactive IGFBP- 2, as detected by anti-mouse IGFBP- 2 antiserum, exhibited generally a similar distribution pattern to that of IGF-I and IGF-IR. In situ hybridization, which has been performed by using riboprobes from S. aurata cDNA, revealed IGF-I mRNA in skeletal musculature, liver, and CNS.

Muscle and body parameters were studied at hatching and at 4, 10, 14, 39 and 55 days post hatching (dph). During the vitelline phase, the total body length growth was scarce, whereas the muscle grew significantly, being the hypertrophy of the main mechanism involved. Both the total body length and the hypertrophy were significantly greater at 16 L: 8 D than in the rest of photoperiod regimes. At 10 and 14 dph, the greatest body length was reached at 16 L: 8 D, followed by the 24 L group, showing the 12 L: 12 D group the lowest values. At 14 dph, the hypertrophy and hiperplasia were also higher at 16 L: 8 D than in the rest of groups. At 39 dph, the highest values of body length were reached in both 16 L: 8 D and 12 L: 12 D regimes, this latter group reaching the highest values of hypertrophy, thus showing a compensatory growth when comparing with the previous stages. The end of the metamorphosis took place at 50 – 55 dph in all the groups, with 2. 7 – 3. 1 cm of body length (P > 0. 05).

40|$|From {{the years}} eighty, the viral encephalopathy-retinopathy (VER, OIE 2003), {{neuropathy}} {{caused by a}} virus belonging to genus Betanodavirus, family Nodaviridae (Ball et al., 2000), is responsible for severe losses in many species of marine farmed fish (more than 31 species distributed 16 different families) throughout the world (Munday et al., 2002). In the Mediterranean basin the VER has been quickly diffused from years ninety, affecting above all seabass (D. labrax) and, later on, <b>shi</b> <b>drum</b> (U. cirrosa). To the contrary, spontaneous infection reports of VER in gilthead seabream (S. aurata) have been very rarely documented (Comps and Raymond 1996; Castric et al., 2001). Although the gilthead can be experimentally infected (Novoa et al., 2001; Aranguren et al., 2002), it thought {{that it is a}} resistant species, documented from the fact that, during serious VER outbreaks in seabass larvae or in other species, no gilthead larvae infection is seen. Some authors documented, through experimental infection, as this species represent rather an asymptomatic carrier of betanodavirus (Castric et al., 2001; Aranguren et al., 2002), more pathogenic for seabass. The descriptive attempt of this surveying is to document a massive mortality outbreak in 15 day-old gilthead larvae, ascribable to viral encephalopathy-retinopathy {{on the basis of the}} histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses. Gilthead larvae, reared in tanks at density of 150 ind/l and supplied to marine filtered and sterilised water (temperature 20 - 21 °C and salinity 40 ‰), showed swim bladder tympanism, abdominal distension, lethargy, anorexia and alteration swim arrangement. During the acute phase of mortality, two samples of moribund larvae have been collected (19 and 29 days of age) and fixed in 4 % neutral buffered formalin. The immunohistochemical tests, using two monoclonal antibodies anti-VER (supplied from the Lombardia and Emilia IZS), were performed. The histopathological observations have put in evidence the presence of the characteristic vacuolar lesions of the central nervous system and peripheral ascribable to VER, localized above all in optic lobe, medulla oblongata, spinal verve chord and in the retinal layers (outer and inner nuclear layer). The immunoperoxidase has confirmed the presence of the virus in the tissues, showing a strongly positivity close to the lesions, characterised by the intense brown diaminobenzidine staining. After the existing literature analysis, this report seems to be the first massive mortality outbreak in gilthead larvae caused by a spontaneous infection of viral encephalopathy-retinopathy in Italy...|$|E
