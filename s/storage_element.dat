40|$|Using level-sensitive latches {{instead of}} edge-triggered {{registers}} for <b>storage</b> <b>elements</b> in a synchronous system {{can lead to}} faster and less expensive circuit implementations. This advantage derives from an increased flexibility in scheduling the computations performed by the circuit.

In either type of circuit, achieving maximum performance requires locating the <b>storage</b> <b>elements</b> {{in such a way as}} to spread the computation uniformly across a number of clock cycles.

40|$|It is a {{significant}} and longstanding puzzle that the resistor, inductor, capacitor (RLC) networks obtained by the established RLC realization procedures appear highly nonminimal {{from the perspective of}} linear systems theory. Specifically, each of these networks contains significantly more energy <b>storage</b> <b>elements</b> than the McMillan degree of its impedance, and possesses a non-minimal state-space representation whose states correspond to the inductor currents and capacitor voltages. Despite this apparent non-minimality, there have been no improved algorithms since the 1950 s, with the concurrent discovery by Reza, Pantell, Fialkow and Gerst of a class of networks (the RPFG networks), which are a slight simplification of the Bott- Duffin networks. Each RPFG network contains {{more than twice as many}} energy <b>storage</b> <b>elements</b> as the McMillan degree of its impedance, yet it has never been established if all of these energy <b>storage</b> <b>elements</b> are necessary. In this paper, we present some newly discovered alternatives to the RPFG networks. We then prove that the RPFG networks, and these newly discovered networks, contain the least possible number of energy <b>storage</b> <b>elements</b> for realizing certain positive-real functions. In other words, all RLC networks which realize certain impedances contain more than twice the expected number (McMillan degree) of energy <b>storage</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R

30|$|Energy storage systems (ESS) with {{bidirectional}} DC-DC converters {{are essential}} in renewable energy based micro-grids, electric vehicles (EVs), transportations, et al [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Bidirectional DC-DC converters {{play the role}} of converting and transferring the electrical energy of the <b>storage</b> <b>elements,</b> which conduct both charge and discharge operation. As a result, the bidirectional DC-DC converters are the key interfaces for efficient energy management. Generally, the voltage of the <b>storage</b> <b>elements</b> is relatively low due to safety issues. Meanwhile, the bus voltage of the DC-based micro-grid, electric EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs) is relatively high in order to improve the system power level. Consequently, a step-up and step-down bidirectional converter is required to link the low voltage <b>storage</b> <b>elements</b> and high voltage bus. How to derive high efficiency DC-DC converters with large conversion ratio is still challengeable in the power electronics community.|$|R
