40|$|A {{considerable}} {{volume of}} electrical and electronic {{printed circuit boards}} are manufactured, by the punching process, from paper based and glass fibre re-inforced laminates. The effects, of the constituent elements of GFR laminate, upon the punching characteristics of the board were studied {{by means of a}} specially designed press dynamometer located within a standard press-tool die set used on a mechanical crank press. Both hot and cold punching techniques were developed initially by the use of commercially supplied samples of both paper and GFR laminates. Laboratory manufactured polyester laminates were produced with different resins, filler sizes and forms of glass fibre re-inforcement. These experimental boards were punched and analysed in respect to specific punching criteria and laminate punched quality. The punch quality (PQ) was assessed by a quanti tative technique using a magnified image of the punched contour and a graticule; the punch contour used was of a special design to incorporate the PQ requirements and provide the extreme crack propagation geometry. The surface density of the glass fibre re-inforcement was found to' be a primary factor influencing the main punch load and shear energy criteria used. The ladder <b>stripping</b> <b>load</b> required to remove the ladder from the punch was also investigated by means of a strain-gauged stripper-pad, and showed an important sensitivity to punching temperature, which could be utilized in industry when ladder stripping is a problem. Additional to the main programme of work already outlined above, a series of test punchings were also made at different punch velocities on three other sets of equipment, one of which was an Instron testing machine using a punch and die accessory conforming to BS. 2782 requirements for shear testing of plastic sheet etc. From this basic Instron shear load information a simple mathematical model was developed to quantify the relative shear energy functions of the different punching equipments used; for the crank press die-set the specific shear energy (SSE) absorbed was found to be considerably higher than {{for the remainder of the}} test rigs used, thus some consideration was given to this result. One factor influencing this result was found to be related to the punch/die clearance deduced from the re-plotted -punch data. Some suggestions for future punching research work have been made, particularly in respect to die-set punching energy and small hole production which could be of great significance to industrial PCB manufacturers...|$|E
40|$|A {{finite element}} analysis, {{by means of}} ABAQUS, has been {{undertaken}} to {{study the effects of}} inserting geogrid layers in the soil cover of a circular soil-steel bridge with a diameter of 7. 6 m. Two loads are applied to the soil-steel bridge: gravity, as well as a truck load defined by the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code design truck. Because experimentation and design of geogrids involve the application of a <b>strip</b> <b>load,</b> it is necessary to apply a <b>strip</b> <b>load</b> at the soil surface. Therefore, the rear two axles of the truck, separated by 1. 2 m, are the largest loads of the truck and are converted into a <b>strip</b> <b>load</b> in order to model the <b>strip</b> <b>load</b> utilized for study of geogrids. The study analyzed different depths of cover above the flexible pipe, with unreinforced and reinforced soil cover. Geogrids are placed in soil in order to increase the bearing capacity of the soil. It is expected that the geogrid will increase the load carrying capacity of the soil-steel bridge. Thus, various geogrid layers are placed in the specified depths of cover over the flexible pipe. Two types of <b>strip</b> <b>loading,</b> concentric and eccentric, will be applied, and each was applied until failure of the soil occurs. Concentric load is defined as the <b>strip</b> <b>load</b> applied at the soil surface where the centre of the <b>strip</b> <b>load</b> is directly above the crown of the pipe. Eccentric load is defined by the <b>strip</b> <b>load</b> applied at the soil surface offset a horizontal distance from the crown of the pipe. Soil behaviour due to the failure load, defined by vertical and horizontal displacements and shear stresses of the soil, are presented for the two types of load cases for the unreinforced and reinforced soil cover above the circular soil-steel bridge.

These studies aim to develop sensors with high sensitivity and compact size. To achieve that aim, sensors that are made of photonic crystals (PhC) cavities are studied by sensing the measurand through the resonance wavelength interrogation method. In integrated sensor studies, intensive numerical calculations by PWE method, mode solving technique and FDTD methods are carried out for the design of high light confinement waveguiding structures on TFLN and suitable PhC configurations. Four types of waveguide (WG) structures (ridge WG, <b>strip</b> <b>loaded</b> WG, slot WG and double slot WG) are studied with a large range of geometrical parameters. Among them, slot WG yields the highest confinement factor while <b>strip</b> <b>loaded</b> WG is an easier option for realizations. Bragg grating is designed in slot WG with an ultra compact size (about 0. 5 µm× 0. 7 µm × 6 µm) and is employed to design PhC cavity. A moderate resonance Q of about 300 in F-P like cavity where the mirrors are made of PhC is achieved with ER of about 70 % of the transmission. Theoretical minimum E-field sensitivity of this slot Bragg grating structure can be as low as 200 µV/m. On the other hand, Si 3 N 4 <b>strip</b> <b>loaded</b> WG is designed with 2 D PhC structure and a low resonance Q of about 100 is achieved. Fabrications of nano-metrical WG such as ridge WG Si 3 N 4 <b>strip</b> <b>loaded</b> are demonstrated. However, the realization of nanometric components on LN presents a big challenge.
