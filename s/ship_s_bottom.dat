5000|$|Late on {{the night}} of 29 August, the Prime Minister {{introduced}} an emergency bill entitled the [...] "Border Protection Bill 2001".

The bill was intended to enter into force at 9:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time, 29 August 2001 (s 2); thus making the bill retroactive. It also attempted to ensure actions taken prior to legislation passage to remove ship and return people to it would have been treated as legal.|$|R
