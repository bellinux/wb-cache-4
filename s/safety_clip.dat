Due the difficulty of identifying pallet rack those <b>safety</b> <b>clips</b> can be hard to find when searching for the manufacturer who provides them. The pallet rack safety bolt has a universal design made specifically to work with several styles of pallet rack systems including: SpaceRak, Interlake, Ridg-U-Rak Teardrop, USP, Excel Storage Products, Bulldog, Hannibal, Steel King, Wireway, and many others. The key indicator to see if the universal pallet rack pin will work with used rack systems is finding the 2 [...]30" [...] holes that align in the pallet rack cross beam and upright frame.|$|R

When the escort group arrived they picked up a contact on their ASDIC and the [...] was sunk. Weather conditions were still not good for flying, and in the following days a Swordfish returning from a night patrol landed in the sea alongside the carrier and the crew were reported missing, believed killed. A pitching deck caused one Swordfish to crash into the sea on take-off and engine failure caused the crash of another Swordfish. One Swordfish clipped the island superstructure, losing [...] off both wing tips when taking off. The pilot managed to get the aircraft into the air, circled around while jettisoning his depth charges, and landed again without mishap. Landing on the heaving deck was just as dangerous as taking off: two Sea Hurricanes and two Swordfish missed the arrestor wires and ended up crashing into the safety barriers.|$|R

50|$|Predecessors to the M68, these impact fuzed grenades {{used the}} M33 grenade body fitted with the M217 impact fuze, without a <b>safety</b> <b>clip</b> {{on the safety}} lever, and are marked {{in a similar manner}} to the M68.|$|E
50|$|The V40 grenade is spherical in shape, 6.5 cm high, and 4 cm in {{diameter}} - approximately {{the size of}} a golf-ball. It has a safety pin and safety lever with a <b>safety</b> <b>clip</b> attached to the safety lever.|$|E
50|$|The body {{is solid}} {{aluminium}} with a textured plastic coating {{made in the}} same form as the live grenade, the textured coating ensuring a good gripping surface. A hole drilled {{up from the bottom}} indicates an empty store as well as ensuring the drill grenade is of the same weight as a live grenade. A bushing on top of the grenade has a dummy fuze mechanism permanently attached with a slot for the pull ring to clip into to prevent it being accidentally pulled. The fuze mechanism, under the plastic cover is very similar in appearance to the American fuze mechanisms. Internally there is an extension on the striker to allow it to be re-cocked during training and there is a leaf spring <b>safety</b> that <b>clips</b> around the <b>safety</b> lever and neck of the grenade preventing the lever from rotating even if the safety pin is pulled.|$|R

5000|$|When Picton Castle {{arrived at}} St. Kitts on 24 December, an {{investigator}} of the Ministry of Transport for the Cook Islands, the ships country of registry, {{came on board}} and started a preliminary investigation, which was finished on 19 February 2007. A Board of Marine Inquiry, after reviewing the preliminary investigation, issued a final report in summer 2007. An investigation titled [...] "Overboard" [...] by the CBC program The Fifth Estate, first aired on November 28, 2007, claimed to have uncovered serious safety problems with the ship. A few days before, the Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB), as an interested party given the close ties of the ship to Canada and given that both the ships owner and the lost seaman are Canadian, began an independent investigation on November 18, 2007; they reviewed {{the report of the}} Cook Islands and issued their own Marine Investigation Report (M06F0024 - Crew Member Lost Overboard, Sail Training Vessel Picton Castle, 376 nm SSE of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia), released on July 24, 2008 and available on their website. The report found among the [...] "causes and contributing factors" [...] that the decision to set to sea did not sufficiently take into account the long-range weather forecasts, especially in view of the crews qualification and experience; the lost deckhand did not get enough sleep in the 1-2 days before the accident; most likely miscommunication on the fatal evening resulted in her still getting up every hour instead of getting rest; the port breezeway of the ship was designated [...] "off-limits" [...] by the ships master, but due to inefficient communication, the lost deckhand seems to have remained unaware of that order; in the heavy weather, no safety nets were rigged on the ship; safety lines were rigged, but safety harnesses were not worn, and there were no [...] "established fastening points" [...] (other than the safety lines) to which to <b>clip</b> <b>safety</b> harnesses. Several measures were subsequently undertaken and procedures changed on the ship, to address some of the concerns and to generally improve safety on the ship (e.g., wearing safety harnesses at night and in heavy weather; monitoring fatigue of crew members; etc.).|$|R
5000|$|Beyond {{the basic}} pin-and-lever mechanism, {{contemporary}} grenades have safety features. The main ones are the <b>safety</b> <b>clip</b> and the bent {{end of the}} safety pin. The <b>safety</b> <b>clip</b> {{was introduced in the}} M61 grenade (1960s, Vietnam War), and is also known as the [...] "jungle clip" [...] - this provides a backup for the safety pin, in case it is dislodged, notably by jungle growth. This is particularly important because the safety lever is often used as a carry hook, despite the obvious danger this poses. The bent end of the safety pin increases the force required to remove it, reducing the risk of accidental arming. The 2016 US ET-MP uses a user-settable timed electronic fuze.|$|E
50|$|An Elsie mine is {{constructed}} mainly from plastic, {{which makes it}} difficult to detect. The mine comprises two separate items; the body and charge. The body is fitted with a protective dust cap, which is removed in order to insert the charge. Around the shaft of the charge there is a restraining <b>safety</b> <b>clip</b> to prevent it moving downwards whilst in transit, which could accidentally trigger detonation. The <b>safety</b> <b>clip</b> is removed when the mine is emplaced, at which point the mine becomes armed and will detonate if someone steps on it. Elsie mines are supplied with an aluminium detector ring fitted. However, the ring is designed to be easily removed, and without it the mine becomes a minimal metal mine.|$|E
50|$|The No 6 is a British minimum metal anti-personnel mine. The mine {{is a long}} thin {{cylinder}} with a tapered {{bottom and}} a three pronged trigger on the top. A metal <b>safety</b> <b>clip</b> prevents the mine being triggered before it is armed. A detector ring can be fitted around {{the middle of the}} mine. Sufficient pressure on the prongs will break a sheer ring, and release the striker, triggering the mine.|$|E
50|$|The M26 {{series is}} in many ways an upgrade in basic {{principle}} of the Mk II: a similarly shaped, but not visibly ribbed, fragmentation grenade. The M26 has a filling of Composition B contained within a sheet steel two-part outer shell which covers a prenotched fragmentation coil inner liner. The use of the inner liner creates a highly predictable fragment pattern and casualty radius. The grenade was found to have problems with incomplete detonation of the filler, and the M26A1 featured a tetryl booster to ensure complete detonation. The M61 grenade was the product of a further Product Improvement Project or PIP, and is identical to the M26A1 {{with the exception of the}} additional <b>safety</b> <b>clip</b> for the spoon of the grenade on the M61. The M26A2 is identical to the M26A1 except for being fitted with the M217 impact fuze. The M57 is the equivalent of the M61 for the M26A1, and is the same as the M26A2 with the exception of the additional <b>safety</b> <b>clip</b> on the spoon of the grenade.|$|E
50|$|The M86 mine {{is similar}} in {{configuration}} and possesses functioning characteristics of the ADAM mine presently loaded in the 155mm projectile, M731 (and M692). The mine is wedge shaped, and contains a <b>safety</b> <b>clip,</b> arming strap assembly, internal safing and arming device, seven tripline sensor, a reserve battery, electronic circuitry containing an IC chip, and a kill mechanism surrounded by an overlay containing a liquid propellant, and encapsulated in a molded plastic form.|$|E
5000|$|The M67 grenade has a spherical {{steel body}} that {{contains}} 6.5 oz of composition B explosive. It uses the M213 pyrotechnic delay fuze. The M67 grenade weighs 14 oz in total {{and has a}} <b>safety</b> <b>clip</b> to prevent the safety pin on the grenade from being pulled accidentally. The safety pin prevents the safety lever, or [...] "spoon" [...] on the grenade from moving and releasing the spring-loaded striker which initiates the grenade's fuze assembly.|$|E
5000|$|Similar in {{format to}} the M26, the M33 is a spherical {{fragmentation}} grenade also filled with Composition B explosive. Unlike the M26, the inner wall is prescored {{and does not}} contain a fragmentation coil. The grenade has a smooth surface, unlike the Mk II series [...] "pineapple" [...] casing. The M67 {{was part of a}} similar PIP, and is identical to the M33 {{with the exception of the}} additional <b>safety</b> <b>clip</b> for the spoon of the grenade on the M67. Early M33 grenades were also more of an oval shape before transitioning over to the more spherical shape of the M67. The M67 is the current issue HE-Frag grenade for the US military. The M33A1 is the impact version of the M33, using the M217 electrical impact fuze in place of the normal delay fuze. At an unknown time the M33A1 was redesignated as the M59. There should be no difference between these grenades except that the M33A1 may be more ovular in shape than the more spherical M59. The M68 is the same as the M59, with the exception of the additional <b>safety</b> <b>clip.</b>|$|E
50|$|This is {{a variant}} of the M67 fitted with the M217 impact fuze and a <b>safety</b> <b>clip</b> on the safety lever. This fuze has an {{electrical}} impact function which arms within 1 to 2 seconds and will detonate the grenade upon impact, and a back-up pyrotechnic delay function which will initiate the grenade after 3 to 7 seconds if the impact function fails. The M68 has the same statistics and markings as the M67 except it has a red-painted fuze and lever to indicate it has an impact fuze.|$|E
50|$|The classic {{hand grenade}} design has a safety handle or lever (known in the US forces as the spoon) and a {{removable}} safety pin that prevents the handle from being released: the safety lever is spring-loaded, {{and once the}} safety pin is removed, the lever will release and ignite the detonator, then fall off. Thus, to use a grenade, the lever is grasped (to prevent release), then the pin is removed, and then the grenade is thrown, which releases the lever and ignites the detonator, triggering explosion. Some grenade types also have a <b>safety</b> <b>clip</b> to prevent the handle from coming off in transit.|$|E
5000|$|The BM/85 is an Italian blast {{resistant}} bounding anti-personnel mine that {{was produced by}} Tecnovar italiana SpA. The mine is cylindrical with a three pronged tilt/pressure fuze on the top with a central post for attaching a tripwire. A plastic <b>safety</b> <b>clip</b> prevents the fuze from tilting when in transit. Once the pressure clip is removed the mine is armed. Once the fuze is pulled sideways by a trip wire or by downward pressure, the mine is triggered. A small charge launches the mine to a height of about 0.45 meters where it explodes scattering 1,000 fragments to a lethal radius of about 25 meters.|$|E
5000|$|The {{plastic casing}} {{of the mine}} is usually dark olive green, and has a large central fuze well. Normally it has a {{carrying}} handle on one side. The mine is normally fitted with the M606 fuze which has an arming switch with two settings, S(afe) and A(rmed). These markings are either painted in yellow or embossed into the plastic. When the switch is set to [...] "A" [...] and the <b>safety</b> <b>clip</b> is removed, the mine will detonate if a vehicle drives over it. The firing mechanism is triggered by a belleville spring which flips the firing pin downwards into the stab detonator, setting off the adjacent booster charge and main explosive filling.|$|E
50|$|To use a grenade, {{the soldier}} grips {{it with the}} {{throwing}} hand, ensuring that his thumb holds the safety lever in place; {{if there is a}} <b>safety</b> <b>clip,</b> it is removed prior to use. Left-handed soldiers are advised to invert the grenade, so the thumb is still the digit that holds the safety lever. The soldier then grabs the safety pin's pull ring with the index or middle finger of the other hand and removes it. He then throws the grenade towards the target. Soldiers are trained to throw grenades in standing, prone-to-standing, kneeling, prone-to-kneeling, and alternate prone positions and in under- or side-arm throws. If the grenade is thrown from a standing position the thrower must then immediately seek cover or lie prone if no cover is nearby.|$|E
