50|$|The {{work permit}} <b>shortage</b> <b>occupations</b> list {{contains}} jobs within the engineering, healthcare, and other professions.|$|R
5000|$|The Committee {{produced}} {{a report in}} 2016 in which they heavily criticised the Department of Health, Health Education England and NHS trusts for not recognising obvious warning signs {{over a number of}} years, and [...] "reluctantly" [...] agreed to keep nursing on the list of <b>shortage</b> <b>occupations.</b>|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, we {{illustrate}} how also the limitations to wage dynamic adjustments as {{captured by the}} QuBe model influence the interpretation of results and the derived recommendations for practical actions. For this, {{we look at the}} effect of different wage policies. We compare a  10 % and a  20 % increase of wages until 2030 for <b>shortage</b> <b>occupations.</b> We see that in the QuBe model these wage increases would be able to balance some occupational submarkets, however, mainly by a reduction of labour demand and, thus, a lower production or service provision in the economy. For the remaining <b>shortage</b> <b>occupations</b> in these scenarios, we discuss how wages as a policy tool simply are not effective given the QuBe assumptions about wage dynamics of occupational mobility. Especially for technicians, doctors, and nursing staff other factors related to working conditions may be more important for political actions. In the case of health occupations, also working regulations play an important role, which limits the extent to which workers from outside can be recruited for this field.|$|R

50|$|In October 2015 The UK Government {{announced}} that Nurses {{will be added}} to the government’s <b>shortage</b> <b>occupation</b> list on an interim basis.|$|E
50|$|In November 2011, Actuaries {{were added}} to the UK Government's <b>shortage</b> <b>occupation</b> list. The Actuarial Profession had argued for Actuaries' {{inclusion}} on this list.|$|E
30|$|It is {{critical}} to design programs of this kind in cooperation with labor unions or employees’ associations at the destination. In the nursing and personal care sector, for example, workers’ associations at the destination are likely to express a legitimate interest in the effects of foreign trainees on their own working conditions and negotiating power. The possibility of conflict might be reduced by focusing training on <b>shortage</b> <b>occupations,</b> but {{is unlikely to be}} eliminated.|$|R
30|$|In the following, we examine, {{what kind}} of {{adjustments}} in the occupational flexibility behaviour {{would be needed to}} distribute unemployed workers evenly and to overcome labour shortages in every OF in 2030. Thus, this scenario entails a redistribution of the labour supply from surplus to <b>shortage</b> <b>occupations.</b> Also looking at the results from the previous section, we assess how wages can serve to achieve the resulting differences in the stayer rate according to the assumptions of the baseline scenario.|$|R
40|$|One in ten NHS doctor posts are vacant – yet foreign-trained medics already make {{up nearly}} 29 % of the workforce. Although Theresa May has said EU-born doctors working here may stay until enough Britons {{are trained to}} replace them, {{recruiting}} and keeping staff {{is likely to become}} more difficult because of the uncertainty surrounding their future immigration status. Victoria Simpkin says NHS workers need clarity now and any work permit scheme must give priority to <b>shortage</b> <b>occupations</b> in the NHS...|$|R
50|$|In October 2011, actuaries {{were added}} to the UK Government's <b>shortage</b> <b>occupation</b> list. They were removed from the list in April 2013 {{following}} a consultation by the Committee in January 2013.|$|E
50|$|Actuaries {{were removed}} from the <b>shortage</b> <b>occupation</b> list in April 2013 {{following}} a consultation by the UK Government's Migration Advisory Committee in January 2013. On this occasion, the Actuarial Profession made no submission either way; neither for nor against a shortage of Actuaries.|$|E
50|$|Despite the Actuarial Profession advising a {{shortage}} of Actuaries, freedom of information requests to the UK Border Agency (now superseded by UK Visas and Immigration) have revealed that only 19 people emigrated to the UK to work as an Actuary via the <b>shortage</b> <b>occupation</b> list from 1 November 2011 to 12 March 2013.|$|E
2500|$|An Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development {{survey in}} December 2015 showed that 21.7% of NHS nurses were born abroad, {{compared}} with 26.9 in Ireland, 9.8% in Italy, 14% in Germany and 5.9% in France. The UK {{was the highest}} exporter of nurses, with more than 50,000 British nurses working in other OECD nations. The Migration Advisory Committee produced a report in 2016 in which they heavily criticised the Department of Health, Health Education England and NHS trusts for not recognising obvious warning signs {{over a number of}} years, and [...] "reluctantly" [...] agreed to keep nursing on the list of <b>shortage</b> <b>occupations.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{results show}} (cf. Table  4) that with a wage {{increase}} {{of an additional}} 10 % until 2030 for <b>shortage</b> <b>occupations,</b> labour <b>shortages</b> will be reduced by about 140, 000 persons in 2030, so that the total deficit in this scenario equals 195, 000 persons. Shortages could be prevented in 4 of the 9  shortage MOF of the baseline scenario, namely in the MOF  4 ‘Construction, woodworking, plastic manufacture and processing ocupations, MOF  7 ‘Commodity trade in retail’, MOF  11 ‘Hotel, restaurant occupation, housekeeping’, and the MOF  12 ‘Cleaning, disposal occupations’. Looking at the results, of the 20 % increase in wage growth for baseline <b>shortage</b> <b>occupations,</b> the total deficit of labour supply equals about 115, 000 persons, which is a reduction by even 225, 000 persons compared to the baseline scenario. However, the labour market is balanced in only one additional MOF compared to a  10 % increase until 2030, namely the MOF  9 ‘Transport, warehouse operatives, packers’. We {{can see that the}} balance in these MOF is mainly achieved by a reduction in labour demand. Since labour productivity remains unchanged, note that this corresponds to a reduction in production or service provision, respectively. In these occupations, outside price pressures are too high, such that large wage adjustments are infeasible for employers without reducing their output. Here, it is more realistic that alternative strategies would be used to retain workers or workers would be hired from abroad to keep the wage level low.|$|R
30|$|The BIBB-IAB {{qualification}} {{and occupational}} field projections (Maier et al. 2014) is {{to our knowledge}} the only long-term projection model, which explicitly formulate such a reallocation process. In this model, the central link between demand and supply is wages: Employers raise wages in <b>shortage</b> <b>occupations</b> to make work in these fields more attractive and workers react to relative changes in their outside wage opportunities and adjust their intent to stay. The great degree of detail of the model by 63  economic sectors and 54  occupational fields provides a thorough description of the diverse adjustment behaviours of different groups of market participants. In this way, the projection results also implicitly capture reallocation behaviours, which are not driven by wage and scarcity, respectively.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, the {{organisation}} requested for ethnic restaurant staff positions to be {{designated as a}} <b>shortage</b> <b>occupation,</b> {{which would make it}} easier for Bangladeshi citizens to obtain UK work permits. In 2014, {{the organisation}} established a cross party parliamentary group to lobby the British Government on behalf of the curry industry. It had the support of 24 MPs with 70 more promising to support the cause.|$|E
50|$|In April 2008, Rashid {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of the Trafalgar Square demonstration, which was attended by tens of thousands of people. This led to a debate in the House of Commons about immigration rules. The demonstration was aimed at drawing government attention to the problems the curry industry had over skilled chefs being included in the <b>shortage</b> <b>occupation</b> list of the UK Border Agency.|$|E
50|$|It offers {{independent}} {{advice to}} the government on immigration policy, and particularly on the <b>Shortage</b> <b>Occupation</b> List. When occupations are placed on this list, UK employers have less restrictions for recruiting candidates directly from overseas; specifically from outside the EU. They would {{no longer need to}} complete a residency test, which involves demonstrating that a search for suitable candidates within the UK in the first instance has been unsuccessful.|$|E
30|$|The Australia Pacific Technical College (APTC) is {{a network}} of five {{technical}} training campuses in the developing Pacific Island states of Vanuatu, Samoa, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. It was created in 2007 to offer Australia-recognized training qualifications for electricians, chefs, hospitality workers, and other skilled tradespersons. It was designed and subsidized by Australian aid to serve two goals: to build up human capital on the islands, and to provide skilled workers for <b>shortage</b> <b>occupations</b> in Australia. In this role it internationalizes skill creation. The second of these goals has been largely discarded as the APTC evolved. Just 1.2 % of the APTC’s roughly 5, 000 graduates have moved to Australia or New Zealand since the College was created.|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{we have seen}} that Germany will face {{structural}} demographic changes over the next decade. Increasing migration flows can {{be part of the solution}} for this economy. In particular, Germany will need qualified workers to fill the labor <b>shortages</b> in engineering-related <b>occupations,</b> health services and legal, business and management occupations.|$|R
5|$|After the Belgian defeat, around 225,000 Belgian {{soldiers}} (around 30 {{percent of}} the total force mobilised in 1940) who had been made prisoners of war in 1940 were sent to prisoner of war camps in Germany. The majority of those in captivity (145,000) were Flemish, and 80,000 were Walloons. Most had been reservists, rather than professional soldiers, before the outbreak of war and their detention created a large labour <b>shortage</b> in civilian <b>occupations.</b>|$|R
50|$|If the {{position}} {{for which the}} prospective employer is seeking a work permit is on the <b>shortage</b> <b>occupation</b> list, there is no requirement for the employer to meet the advertising criteria set by Work Permits (UK). Otherwise the employer will need to advertise for {{the position}} in a government accredited place - a broadsheet paper, online etc. This advert {{will have to be}} 'live' for a set period of time and the employer will have to prove that the applicant is the most qualified for that position.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Guild of Bangladeshi Restaurateurs {{requested}} {{for ethnic}} restaurant staff positions to be {{designated as a}} <b>shortage</b> <b>occupation,</b> {{which would make it}} easier for Bangladeshi citizens to obtain UK work permits. In 2008, Guild of Bangladeshi Restaurateurs members raised concerns that many restaurants were under threat because the British Government announced a change in immigration laws which could block entry of high skilled chefs from Bangladesh to the UK. They requested that the Government recognises that they are skilled workers. The law demanded these workers speak fluent English, and have good formal qualifications. However, these changes did not take place.|$|E
50|$|In September 2015 it was {{reported}} that the trust was facing a staffing crisis because its plans to recruit more Filipino nurses were frustrated by the points-based immigration system. 85 applications for tier 2 certificates of sponsorship were rejected between June and September 2015. The NHS Employers Organisation wrote on behalf of the Trust, and nine others similarly placed, to the Home Secretary, Theresa May complaining that about 1000 applications had been rejected in six months, and anticipating that a further thousand would also be rejected. The Home Office responded by saying that over 1,400 tier 2 certificates of sponsorship had been issued to nurses since April 2015, but 600 had been 'returned unused.' Nurses were removed from the <b>Shortage</b> <b>Occupation</b> List on 6 April 2015, and the pay of most nurses is not sufficient to gain priority under the points based system.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s the NCF started to {{manufacture}} opiates like morphine and codeine {{to fill the}} gap left by the disappearing market for cocaine. The market situation for these products was not positive however, and margins were small. At the outbreak of World War II the NCF saw increased profits on its opiates, because of market <b>shortages.</b> Under German <b>occupation</b> the NCF produced ephedrine, but a lack of raw materials soon affected the company.|$|R
50|$|The {{size and}} {{composition}} of Australia’s permanent migration program is reviewed annually to maximise its potential. The 2010-11 migration program was set at 168,700 places—an overall total which was unchanged from 2009-10. Within this total, the skill stream was allocated 113 850 places to address current and emerging skill <b>shortages</b> in critical <b>occupations</b> and regions. The family stream was set at 54 550 places, recognising the benefits that accrue when Australians have their parents, partners, carers or children join them to live in Australia permanently.|$|R
40|$|A Shorten Labor Government {{will work}} with our universities, {{industry}} and science agencies to get the incentives right {{to meet the needs}} of the future economy.   From skill <b>shortages</b> in key <b>occupations</b> to productivity-driving opportunities in new industries, universities will be encouraged within the existing funding system to be more responsive to drivers of growth.   In consultation with universities, Labor will establish an independent Higher Education Productivity and Performance Commission to drive these labour market outcomes. Similar Commissions are common in other developed economies; in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Hong Kong, and provide good examples of best practice for Australia to consider...|$|R
50|$|The {{system has}} been criticised by the NHS Employers Organisation because NHS trusts faced a {{staffing}} crisis because plans to recruit more Filipino nurses were frustrated by the points-based immigration system. 85 applications by Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust for tier 2 certificates of sponsorship were rejected between June and September 2015.

30|$|In this article, I have {{explored}} {{the challenges that}} accompanying partners of highly-skilled migrants face when trying to take up work after migration, and I have examined the strategies they develop. Only rarely is it the case that accompanying partners can start working immediately after migration and continue their former careers without major interruptions (Hardill, 1998). The study suggests {{that this is the}} case for partners who have national cultural capital as well as for partners who work in a <b>shortage</b> <b>occupation.</b> Most partners, however, experience a devaluation of their cultural capital in the host country, with some partners facing additional challenges because their occupation is regulated by law, their skills are too specialised for the regional labour market or their cultural capital was acquired in the global south.|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} the top-down methodology used by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to identify shortage occupations. Identifying shortage occupations is difficult and few countries have attempted {{to do this in}} a systematic way. The methodology developed by the MAC to identify shortage occupations is the first to use a comprehensive range of indicators. The methodology dovetails national level top-down data with bottom-up micro-level data and qualitative information from stakeholders and was used to advise the UK Government on occupations for inclusion on the UK Government’s <b>Shortage</b> <b>Occupation</b> List for use under Tier 2 of the Point Based System for managing migration. This {{article describes}} the top-down methodology; it does not present any new data or conclusions. Further information on the methodology can be found in Chapter 7 and Annex B of the MAC’s September 2008 report.

40|$|A {{staggering}} one out {{of every}} four young people is presently unemployed in Spain. And comparable numbers in Greece, Portugal and Italy are hardly more encouraging. Germany, on the other hand, enjoys a historically low youth unemployment rate of 8 % and is experiencing skill <b>shortages</b> in some <b>occupations.</b> Against this background, this Commentary calls upon the European Commission to use its considerable strength and know-how in bringing partners and stakeholders together in order to facilitate the necessary infrastructure to allow better matching across borders of workers and employers. The authors point to the June European Council meeting as offering a good occasion to launch initiatives to this effect...|$|R
5000|$|The housing <b>shortage</b> led to <b>occupation</b> of {{the complex}} by squatters led by ex-convicts in October 2007, with over 200 families, {{representing}} about 40% of Caracas' [...] "informal communities", taking over the center. Residents have improvised basic utility services, with water reaching {{all the way up}} to the 22nd floor. They could use motorcycles to travel up and down the first 10 floors, but had to use the stairs for the remaining levels. The residents lived up to the 28th floor, with many bodegas and even an unlicensed dentist also operating in the building. Some residents even had cars, parked inside of the building's parking garage.|$|R
30|$|In this article, we {{describe}} {{for the first}} time, how reallocations in the labour market can be modelled using occupational flexibility matrices and wage dynamics. Here, it is shown that employers react to labour scarcity by increasing wages to attract workers who to some extent can adjust their mobility behaviour accordingly. We analyse the aggregate impact of this implementation of a reallocation process of labour supply on the projection results by the means of scenario comparisons. Our results suggest that considering reallocations but also additionally their dynamics has substantial effects on the projection outcomes. They help draw an insightful picture of the future labour market and prevent over- or understating the potential for labour <b>shortages</b> in several <b>occupations.</b>|$|R
