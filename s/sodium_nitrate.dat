5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} are {{of immense}} commercial importance, being particularly central to industries producing glass, paper, soap, and textiles. The most important sodium compounds are table salt (NaCl), soda ash (Na2CO3), baking soda (NaHCO3), caustic soda (NaOH), <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate</b> (NaNO3), di- and tri-sodium phosphates, sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3·5H2O), and borax (Na2B4O7·10H2O). In compounds, sodium is usually ionically bonded to water and anions, and {{is viewed as}} a hard Lewis acid.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen is {{the most}} common pure element in the earth, making up 78.1% of the entire volume of the atmosphere. Despite this, it is not very {{abundant}} in Earth's crust, making up only 19parts per million of this, on par with niobium, gallium, and lithium. The only important nitrogen minerals are nitre (potassium nitrate, saltpetre) and sodanitre (<b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> Chilean saltpetre). However, these have not been an important source of nitrates since the 1920s, when the industrial synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became common.|$|E
25|$|From 1903 {{until the}} World War I era, {{potassium}} nitrate for black powder and fertilizer was produced on an industrial scale from nitric acid produced via the Birkeland–Eyde process, which used an electric arc to oxidize nitrogen from the air.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effect of sodium-enriched nitrogen fer-tilizers against the background of pre-sowing sodium fertilization on sugar beet productivi-ty, including technological quality of taproots. A field experiment, completed in 2001 - 2003, consisted of two main factors: (i) pre-sowing sodium application (0, 30 kg Na ha– 1 in the form of NaCl), (ii) a set of nitrogen fertilizing variants, composed of two sub-levels: one consisting of four nitrogen rates (0, 90, 120, 150 kg N ha– 1) and the other one comprising three chemical N fertilizer forms [(i) ammonium nitrate, 34 %, AN, (ii) mixture of ammo-nium and <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrates,</b> 26 %N + 6 % Na (ASN 1), (iii) mixture of ammonium and <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrates,</b> 21 %N + 13 % Na (ASN 2) ]. Depending on a nitrogen rate, the fertilizers were ap-plied on two or three dates. The first N rate was applied only as ammonium nitrate.

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{investigation of}} fertilization {{began at the}} Rothamsted Experimental Station in 1843 by John Bennet Lawes.

Fertilizer, in the shape of <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate</b> deposits in Chile, was imported to Britain by John Thomas North as well as guano (birds droppings).

5|$|Iodine is {{the least}} {{abundant}} of the stable halogens, comprising only 0.46parts per million of Earth's crustal rocks (compare: fluorine 544ppm, chlorine 126ppm, bromine 2.5ppm). Among the eighty-four elements which occur in significant quantities (elements 1–42, 44–60, 62–83, and 90–92), it ranks sixty-first in abundance. Iodide minerals are rare, and most deposits that are concentrated enough for economical extraction are iodate minerals instead. Examples include lautarite, Ca(IO3)2, and dietzeite, 7Ca(IO3)2·8CaCrO4. These are the minerals that occur as trace impurities in the caliche, found in Chile, whose main product is <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate.</b> In total, they can contain at least 0.02% and at most 1% iodine by weight. Sodium iodate is extracted from the caliche and reduced to iodide by sodium bisulfite. This solution is then reacted with freshly extracted iodate, resulting in comproportionation to iodine, which may be filtered off.|$|E
5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, {{so that it can}} be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate,</b> potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E
25|$|Neither {{the use of}} {{graphite}} nor <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate</b> was new. Glossing gunpowder corns with graphite {{was already}} an accepted technique in 1839, and sodium nitrate-based blasting powder {{had been made in}} Peru for many years using the <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate</b> mined at Tarapacá (now in Chile). Also, in 1846, two plants were built in south-west England to make blasting powder using this <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate.</b> The idea may well have been brought from Peru by Cornish miners returning home after completing their contracts. Another suggestion is that it was William Lobb, the planthunter, who recognised the possibilities of <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate</b> during his travels in South America. Lammot du Pont would have known about the use of graphite and probably also knew about the plants in south-west England. In his patent he was careful to state that his claim was for the combination of graphite with sodium nitrate-based powder, rather than for either of the two individual technologies.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the logical}} follow through is sound, the corning {{hypothesis}} has been refuted for two reasons. One, the powder makers were probably {{more worried about}} spoilage than the effect of corned gunpowder on guns, and two, corning as a practice had existed in China since the 1370s. In Europe corning arose {{as a response to}} the difficulty of obtaining pure saltpeter, specifically saltpeter consisting of potassium nitrate, rather than <b>sodium</b> <b>nitrate</b> or calcium nitrate, the latter two of which absorb water vapor more readily than potassium nitrate. Thus corning was an imperative to producing reliable weaponized gunpowder. Supposedly this was much less problematic in Asia, where pure saltpeter was more readily available and easily manufactured. In China gunpowder corning had been practiced since the 1370s for the purpose of strengthening the explosive power of mines, since gunpowder corns provided more space required for a rapid combustion. Corned powder might also have been used in guns based on a record of a fire-tube shooting a projectile 457 meters, a feet probably only possible with the aid of corned powder at the time.|$|E

40|$|The health {{benefits}} of nitrite are now indisputable when administered in a clinical setting for specific diseases. Currently, most published reports identify the production of nitric oxide (NO) as the mechanism of action for nitrite.
