50|$|Stone {{tools and}} other markers of {{settlement}} activity {{were discovered in}} 1924 and due to the supposed “living floor” characteristics {{of some of the}} sites, the excavator Gustav Schwantes interpreted the <b>sites</b> <b>as</b> dwelling <b>sites</b> (Wohnplätze). Irrespective of the current interpretation of the <b>sites</b> <b>as</b> ephemeral hazel nut roasting camps, German archaeological discourse continues to refer to the <b>sites</b> <b>as</b> “Wohnplätze”. Each individual <b>site</b> is designated <b>as</b> Wp (Wohnplatz) and a running number (e.g. Wp1, Wp2, Wp3...). Due to the excellent preservation and unusual find categories, the materials form Duvensee were quickly described as part of their own archaeological culture - the Duvensee Kultur or Duvensee-Gruppen. The finds from the 1924 excavations were recently re-analysed.|$|R
