40|$|A second-generation, Stirling-cycle {{cryocooler}} (cryogenic refrigerator) {{for space}} applications, with a cooling capacity of 5 watts at 65 K, was recently completed. The refrigerator, called the Prototype Model, was designed {{with a goal}} of 5 year life with no degradation in cooling performance. The free displacer and free piston of the refrigerator are driven directly by moving-magnet linear motors with the moving elements supported by active magnetic bearings. The use of clearance seals {{and the absence of}} outgassing material in the working volume of the refrigerator enable long-life operation with no deterioration in performance. Fiber-optic sensors detect the radial position of the shafts and provide a control signal for the magnetic bearings. The frequency, phase, stroke, and offset of the <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> <b>expander</b> are controlled by signals from precision linear position sensors (LVDTs). The vibration generated by the <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> <b>expander</b> is cancelled by an active counter balance which also uses a moving-magnet linear motor and magnetic bearings. The driving signal for the counter balance is derived from the <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> <b>expander</b> position sensors which have wide bandwidth for suppression of harmonic vibrations. The efficiency of the three active members, which operate in a resonant mode, is enhanced by a magnetic spring in the <b>expander</b> <b>and</b> by gas springs in the <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> counterbalance.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the knowledge and the characterization of scroll machines and their systems. It is based on experimental and modeling works carried out on: a) 	A hermetic scroll compressor used inside an air-cooled water chiller. b) 	An oil-free open-drive scroll expander integrated into an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power system. c) 	Open-drive scroll <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> <b>expander</b> used in a Liquid Flooded Ericsson Cycle Cooler (LFEC). Such a system uses the liquid flooding of the <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> of the <b>expander</b> to approach isothermal compression and expansion processes. New semi-empirical models of the scroll <b>compressor</b> <b>and</b> <b>expander</b> were proposed <b>and</b> existing models improved. A deterministic model of the scroll expander was established. The model associates a geometrical description of the machine with a thermodynamic description of the expansion process. This model was validated for the two expanders investigated experimentally. The model validation revealed that {{the performance of the}} expanders is mainly affected by the supply pressure drop and by the internal leakages. Using the validated model, parametric studies were carried out to investigate the variation of the performance of both expanders with modification of their design and with the operating parameters. The thesis also investigated the scroll machines {{from the point of view}} of their integration into thermal systems. A first experimental investigation was carried out on an air-cooled chiller. The scroll compressor semi-empirical model, with its parameters identified on the basis of published manufacturer data, was used as a refrigerant flow meter. The analysis of the experimental data allowed a better understanding of the chiller operation and a better identification of its model parameters (such as the fan and the hot gas bypass control models). A second experimental investigation was carried out on an ORC power system, working with R 123. In order to select the most appropriate fluid, the performances achieved with four different fluids were compared by simulation. The experimental study confirmed that the scroll expander is a good candidate for an ORC system: the tested prototype presented a good performance (the maximum global isentropic effectiveness achieved was 68 %). Using an ORC simulation model, parametric studies were carried out to investigate the effects of the <b>expander</b> characteristics <b>and</b> operating conditions on the cycle performance. The latter is mainly affected by the <b>expander</b> internal leakage <b>and</b> by the liquid subcooling at the condenser exhaust.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a stand-alone polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) system directly fueled by hydrogen has been evaluated for transportation vehicles. The study was carried out using a systems analysis code and a vehicle analysis code. The systems code includes models for the various PEFC components and is applicable for steady-state and transient situations. At the design point the system efficiency is above 50 % for a 50 -kW system. The efficiency improves under partial load and approaches 60 % at 40 % load, as the fuel cell operating point moves to lower current densities on the V-I polarization curve. At much lower loads, the system efficiency drops because of the deterioration in the {{performance of}} the <b>compressor,</b> <b>expander,</b> <b>and</b> eventually the fuel cell. The system performance suffers at lower temperatures, as the V-I characteristic curve for the fuel cell shifts downward because of the increased ohmic losses. The results of the transient analysis indicate that the hydrogen-fueled PEFC system can start rather rapidly, within seconds from ambient conditions. However, the warm-up time constant to reach the design operating temperatures is about 180 s. It is important during this period for the coolant to bypass the system radiator until the coolant temperature approaches the design temperature for the fuel cell. The systems analysis code has been applied to two mid-size vehicles: the near-term Ford AIV Sable and the future P 2000 vehicle. The results of this study show that the PEFC system in these vehicles can respond well {{to the demands of the}} FUDS and Highway driving cycles, with both warm and cold starting conditions.
