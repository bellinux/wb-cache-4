The Yup'ik region is rich with waterfowl, fish, and sea and land mammals. The coastal settlements rely more heavily on sea mammals (seals, walrusses, beluga whales), many species of fish (Pacific salmon, herring, halibut, flounder, trout, burbot, Alaska blackfish), shellfish, crabs, and seaweed. The inland settlements rely more heavily on Pacific salmon and freshwater whitefish, land mammals (moose, caribou), migratory waterfowl, bird eggs, berries, greens, and roots help sustain people throughout the region.

25|$|Traditional <b>subsistence</b> <b>foods,</b> such as {{fish and}} marine mammals, {{and to a}} lesser extent shellfish, are the only {{significant}} direct dietary sources of two important types of the omega-3 fatty acids called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

The replacement of a subsistence diet that is low in fat and high in omega-3s with a market-based Western diet has increased the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in Alaska Natives. Many market (store-bought) foods are high in fats, carbohydrates, and sodium; and these may lead to increased weight gain, high cholesterol (hypercholesterolaemia), high blood pressure (hypertension), and chronic diseases.|$|E

Also known as Cup'ik cuisine for the Chevak Cup'ik dialect speaking Eskimos of Chevak and Cup'ig cuisine for the Nunivak Cup'ig dialect speaking Eskimos of Nunivak Island. This cuisine is traditionally based on meat from fish, birds, sea and land mammals, and normally contains high levels of protein. <b>Subsistence</b> <b>foods</b> are generally {{considered by many to}} be nutritionally superior superfoods. Yup’ik diet is different from Alaskan Inupiat, Canadian Inuit, and Greenlandic diets. Fish as food (especially Salmonidae species, such as salmon and whitefish) are primary food for Yup'ik Eskimos. Both food and fish called neqa in Yup'ik. Food preparation techniques are fermentation and cooking, also uncooked raw. Cooking methods are baking, roasting, barbecuing, frying, smoking, boiling, and steaming. Food preservation methods are mostly drying and less often frozen. Dried fish is usually eaten with seal oil.

The factor analysis identifies three dimensions of indicators to characterise households (rurality, financial resources and time dedicated to main activity). Based on these factors, four clusters of Romanian households are identified. The two poorest groups are the most rural and dependent on subsistence production, and the assessment of the latter’s value is most important to these groups in terms the numbers classified as poor.

40|$|The Sakha {{of northeastern}} Siberia, Russia, {{are the highest}} {{latitude}} contem-porary agropastoralists practicing horse and cattle husbandry. In the last 100 years their rural livelihood has gone from household-level <b>subsistence</b> <b>food</b> production in clan clusters of single-family homesteads scattered across the landscape, to village-level state agribusiness farm production in com-pact settlements dependent on Soviet socialist infrastructure, to the present-day post-socialist reliance on household-level <b>subsistence</b> <b>food</b> production. This paper explores how Viliui Sakha are adapting in the post-Soviet con-text. Since {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union and the concomitant dissolution of the centralized state farm system, rural inhabitants have developed household and interhousehold food production capacities based on keeping cows and relying on exchange among kin. One of the basic tenets of Robert Netting’s smallholder–householder theory is that in times of change, the household sys-tem is the most resilient subsistence production unit because of specific quali-ties including intimate ecological knowledge and implicit labor contracts. This research shows in what ways Netting’s householder theory applies for subarctic agropastoralists.
