5|$|Show {{producers}} {{removed a}} sketch {{which would include}} a rape joke upon Carter's discovery of his daughter, Lois, with her secret family on the southern plantation. Unlike past requests to cut and/or alter jokes, this was not one imposed by the broadcast standards and practices; this was done on the writers' own accord. The sequence showing Peter's silent film star ancestor being <b>stabbed</b> <b>in</b> a card fight was omitted from television broadcasting to save time. Near {{the end of the}} episode, the Griffins are shown arguing over the quality of The Godfather; this scene is drawn from an actual argument that has taken place in the Family Guy writing room over its quality. MacFarlane prefers The 'Burbs and The Money Pit, both of which were received very poorly. Adolf Hitler talking to his wife about his annoyance at Peter Hitler was also removed from television broadcasting for timing purposes.|$|E

Cena won his first singles championship in WWE, the United States Championship from Big Show at WrestleMania XX after delivering an F-U for the pinfall victory. The reign ended almost four months after successful title defences against the likes of Rene Dupree, Rob Van Dam and Booker T, when he was stripped of the title on the July 8 episode of SmackDown! by Angle after he accidentally knocked him over, thus attacking an official. Cena won the championship back defeating Booker T in a best of five series that culminated at No Mercy, only to drop it to the débuting Carlito Caribbean Cool the following week on SmackDown!.

Cena later successfully defended the championship against Jesus at Armageddon in a street fight match.|$|E
