40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} contact angle, volume loss and nanoleakeage profile of five one-component self-etching {{adhesive}} formulations that differed in their HEMA content, on enamel and dentin. METHODS: Contact angles of drops from each adhesive system were measured over 40 enamel and dentin flat surfaces. Volumetric changes were measured as well. The adhesives were then applied over repolished surfaces according to manufacturers' recommendations, {{covered with a}} microfilled restorative composite and the samples were <b>silver</b> <b>infiltrated</b> and prepared for evaluation in a scanning electron microscope. RESULTS: On enamel and dentin surfaces, the contact angles decreased with increasing HEMA content. A correlation was observed between contact angle, volume loss and HEMA content on both substrates...|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{structures}} with two- or three-dimensional {{arrangement of}} materials (photonic crystals) are being considered {{in recent days}} a key structure for the fabrication of advanced optical devices {{with the potential to}} substitute present electronics by all-photonic systems in the near future. Special interest has also arisen for their use as chemical sensors and in the fabrication of solar cells. In this work, a fabrication process for silver artificial structures from a colloidal solution of polystyrene spheres is presented. The colloidal spheres are arranged onto a glass substrate to form an artificial opal that is subsequently <b>infiltrated</b> with <b>silver.</b> Additionally, the structural and optical properties of the fabricated structures are studied. The structural characterization of the opals shows good order in the long scale. Reflectance measurements of these samples present a reflection peak centred around 800 nm. SEM images of the <b>silver</b> <b>infiltrated</b> opals show that the infiltration has been carried out successfully. Even so, the optical characterization of the infiltrated samples shows a big intensification of the original reflectivity with a displacement of only few nanometres from the original peak. After the removal of the spheres, the samples show total inversion. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Objectives The {{purpose of}} {{present study was}} to {{evaluate}} the internal adaptation of composite restorations using different adhesive systems. Materials and Methods Typical class I cavities were prepared in 32 human third molars. The teeth were divided into the following four groups: 3 -step etch-and-rinse, 2 -step etch-and-rinse, 2 -step self-etch and 1 -step self-etch system were used. After the dentin adhesives were applied, composite resins were filled and light-cured in two layers. Then, silver nitrate solution was infiltrated, and all of the samples were scanned by micro-CT before and after thermo-mechanical load cycling. For each image, the length to which <b>silver</b> nitrate <b>infiltrated,</b> {{as a percentage of the}} whole pulpal floor length, was calculated (...|$|R

500|$|The mysterious Rippers {{slaughter}} {{guards at}} the W compound, then escape. Kesslee uses Tank Girl to lure the Rippers into the open, but they gravely wound him and Tank Girl and Jet Girl escape during the attack. Jet Girl steals a fighter jet from W and Tank Girl steals a tank, which she modifies heavily. The girls learn from the eccentric Sub Girl (Ann Cusack) that Sam is working at a sex club called Liquid <b>Silver.</b> They <b>infiltrate</b> the club, rescue Sam from a pedophile, Rat Face (Iggy Pop), and then humiliate the club's owner, [...] "The Madame" [...] (Ann Magnuson), by making her sing Cole Porter's [...] "Let's Do It" [...] at gunpoint. W troops break up the performance and re-capture Sam. Tank Girl and Jet Girl wander the desert and find the Rippers' hideout. They learn that the Rippers are supersoldiers created from human and kangaroo DNA by a man called Johnny Prophet. Tank Girl befriends a Ripper named Booga (Jeff Kober), while a Ripper named Donner (Scott Coffey) shows romantic interest in Jet Girl. Despite the objections of the Ripper T-Saint (Ice-T), who is suspicious of the girls, the Rippers' leader Deetee (Reg E. Cathey) sends the pair out to capture a shipment of weapons. The girls bring the weapon crates back, though {{most of them are}} empty. After finding Johnny Prophet dead in one of the containers, the girls and the Rippers realize that W has tricked them.|$|R
40|$|Two major {{problems}} associated with Si-based MEMS (MicroElectroMechanical Systems) devices are stiction and wear. Surface modifications are needed to reduce both adhesion and friction in micromechanical structures to solve these problems. In this paper, the authors present a CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) process that selectively coats MEMS devices with tungsten and significantly enhances device durability. Tungsten CVD {{is used in the}} integrated-circuit industry, which makes this approach manufacturable. This selective deposition process results in a very conformal coating and can potentially address both stiction and wear problems confronting MEMS processing. The selective deposition of tungsten is accomplished through the silicon reduction of WF{sub 6 }. The self-limiting nature of the process ensures consistent process control. The tungsten is deposited after the removal of the sacrificial oxides to minimize stress and process integration problems. The tungsten coating adheres well and is hard and conducting, which enhances performance for numerous devices. Furthermore, since the deposited <b>tungsten</b> <b>infiltrates</b> under adhered silicon parts and the volume of W deposited is less than the amount of Si consumed, it appears to be possible to release adhered parts that are contacted over small areas such as dimples. The wear resistance of tungsten coated parts {{has been shown to be}} significantly improved by microengine test structures...|$|R
40|$|Bactericidal {{actions of}} the silver ion on Escherichia coli as a model {{microorganism}} were studied using energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM), two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE), and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). EFTEM observations demonstrated that the <b>silver</b> ion readily <b>infiltrates</b> the interior of E. coli, contrary to the early hypothesis that it resides initially in the cell membrane area. Furthermore, 2 -DE and MALDI-TOF MS indicated that {{the expression of a}} ribosomal subunit protein {{as well as that of}} some other enzymes and proteins is affected by the silver ion. The present results demonstrate for the first time that one of the major bactericidal functions of the silver ion is its interaction with the ribosome and the ensuing inhibition in expression of the enzymes and proteins essential to ATP production. The silver ion is known to have antimicrobial effects, and it is increasingly utilized in electric appliances, such as washing machines. Many papers have been published on its effects, and early authors hypothesized that the silver ion primarily affects the function of membrane-bound enzymes, such as those in the respiratory chain, through binding to thiol groups (1, 4, 7) ...|$|R
40|$|Candida albicans is {{the most}} common fungal {{pathogen}} in humans, and recently some studies have reported the antifungal activity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) against some Candida species. However, ultrastructural analyses on the interaction of AgNPs with these microorganisms have not been reported. In this work we evaluated the effect of AgNPs on C. albicans, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was found to have a fungicidal effect. The IC 50 was also determined, and the use of AgNPs with fluconazole (FLC), a fungistatic drug, reduced cell proliferation. In order to understand how AgNPs interact with living cells, the ultrastructural distribution of AgNPs in this fungus was determined. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed a high accumulation of AgNPs outside the cells but also smaller nanoparticles (NPs) localized throughout the cytoplasm. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis confirmed the presence of intracellular silver. From our results it is assumed that AgNPs used in this study do not penetrate the cell, but instead release <b>silver</b> ions that <b>infiltrate</b> into the cell leading to the formation of NPs through reduction by organic compounds present in the cell wall and cytoplasm...|$|R
