His father, Oliver Warwick Speight, is a {{property}} developer, and his mother, Jacqueline Fordham Speight (née Parker), was an art teacher. Jacqueline died on 5 September 2008, aged 62, from a stroke allegedly brought on by the stress of her son's death. Speight attended the independent school Tettenhall College for a year, before moving to state comprehensive Regis School, now known as King's C.E. School, also in Tettenhall, at the age of 12. Speight stated in an interview he was a <b>slow</b> <b>learner</b> at school, with a short attention span, and art was a way for him to communicate. He said he did [...] "very badly" [...] because he was a victim of bullying, and the [...] "daily ordeal for two years" [...] forced him to become the [...] "class joker". Speight left aged 16 and went on to attend Bilston Art School, where he took a degree in commercial and graphic art.|$|E

40|$|This paper reports two {{experiments}} examining {{individual differences}} in procedures for learning to use MINITAB (1982 edition). In Experiment 1, ten novices provided think aloud protocols over five sessions of learning to use MINITAB. On the basis of overall performance, novices {{were divided into two}} groups of five faster and five <b>slower</b> <b>learners.</b> The protocols suggested that subjects used two major classes of learning strategy: learning by doing and learning by thinking. Each class of learning strategy comprised a set of learning procedures. Differences in procedure usage were confined primarily to the learning by doing procedures. Faster learners used the mapping and exploratory procedures more frequently than <b>slower</b> <b>learners,</b> paid more attention to prompts and error messages and acted appropriately on evaluation feedback. In contrast, <b>slower</b> <b>learners</b> used the trial and error and repetition procedures more frequently than faster learners. In Experiment 2, 26 novices were allocated to one of three experimental groups. Group 1 received no instruction, Group 2 received instruction in the use of ineffective procedures (those procedures that did not serve to differentiate between fast and <b>slow</b> <b>learners</b> in Experiment 1) and Group 3 received instruction in the use of effective procedures (those procedures that did differentiate between fast and <b>slow</b> <b>learners</b> in Experiment 1). The overall performance of the effective procedures groups was significantly better than either the control or the ineffective procedures groups. Effective procedure usage ratings correlated significantly with overall performance. The negative correlations between effective procedure usage ratings and both requests for help and mean time to complete the MINITAB tasks were significant. Finally, on a free recall task, the effective procedures group remembered significantly more of the procedures they had been taught than the ineffective procedures group...|$|R
