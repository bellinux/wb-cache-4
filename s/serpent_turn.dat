50|$|Slay {{the serpent}} of Ares, build {{the city of}} Thebes. Reward is three new heroes, but the hero who slays the <b>serpent</b> is <b>turned</b> into a snake.|$|R
50|$|The Queen of the South Sea, {{an ancient}} sex goddess, seduces men before using a serpent that resides in her vagina to devour their penises. One man manages {{to grab the}} <b>serpent,</b> <b>turning</b> it into a dagger. Enraged, the Queen waits {{on the ocean floor}} for a century. In 1989, an {{anthropologist}} named Tania is investigating the legend of the Queen of the South Sea, which results in her diving to the Queen's resting place, being bound to a bed, and violated by a serpent, which allows the Queen to take control of her.|$|R
5000|$|The player {{controls}} (rides, by game description [...] ) a multi-segmented blue 'good' serpent in a maze {{with the}} objective of eating all computer-controlled 'evil' (red or orange or green) serpents. Eating the tail segments of serpents makes them shorter, and a red or orange <b>serpent</b> <b>turns</b> green when shorter than the player. Hitting a green serpent headfirst eliminates it, and causes the player's serpent to grow an additional segment. Hitting a red or orange serpent headfirst causes the player's serpent to die. A frog appears at random intervals and gives any serpent eating it an additional segment. Once all opponents have been eliminated, the player's serpent automatically returns to a protected area.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} they {{anchored}} about ten o'clock opposite the campong of the rajah. It {{was a good}} deal larger than any that they had passed on the way up, but the houses were mere huts, {{with the exception of a}} large wooden structure, which they at once concluded was the residence of the rajah. As soon as the <b>Serpent</b> <b>turned</b> the last bend of the river before reaching the place, the sound of drums and gongs was heard, and a large boat, manned by eighteen rowers, shot out from the bank as the anchor was dropped. The two officials on board at once mounted the accommodation ladder, and on reaching the deck were received by the first lieutenant, behind whom stood a guard of honor of the marines.|$|R
50|$|Sidewinder, disillusioned by the betrayals {{of some of}} the <b>Serpents,</b> had <b>turned</b> {{over control}} of the guild to the Cobra, and Bushmaster served him next. At Diamondback's trial, Bushmaster voted to spare her life from a death sentence. After the trial, Bushmaster fought Diamondback, and next, Captain America and Paladin. He was finally taken into custody. He was later {{released}} from the Vault.|$|R
50|$|Sorceress Lina Inverse is {{contacted}} by an alchemist Diol, who had requested her help {{in one of}} his experiments. She then finds out that Diol plans to use her in creating a super chimera which would combine her with a lesser demon and a sea <b>serpent.</b> Lina <b>turns</b> him down, and after Lina's on-and-off companion and rival Naga the Serpent arrives and agrees to the plan, destroys Diol's lab in anger.|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century the ophicleide was the bass-baritone {{instrument}} of the brass family, replacing the <b>serpent</b> and in <b>turn</b> being replaced by the euphonium. It was a keyed instrument (unlike the serpent), but without valves (unlike the euphonium).|$|R
5000|$|However, in Christian art {{the wearing}} of the hat can be {{sometimes}} be seen to express an attitude to those wearing it. In one extreme example in a manuscript of the Bible moralisée, an illustration shows the rod of Aaron, which has <b>turned</b> into a <b>serpent,</b> <b>turning</b> on the Pharaoh's magicians (Exodus, 7:10-12); Moses and Aaron do not wear the hat but the Egyptian magicians do, signifying not that they are Jews, but that they are like Jews, i.e. {{on the wrong side}} of the dispute. The paired roundel below shows two tonsured clerics confronting a group of hat-wearing Jews, and has a Latin caption explaining [...] "Moses and Aaron signify good prelates who, in explaining the words of the Gospel, devour the false words of the Jews". [...] In another scene showing the conversion of Jews and other non-Christians at the end of the world, a series of figures show different stages of removing their hats to signify the stages they have reached in their conversion, so that [...] "the hat does not just identify Jews; it functions independently of its placement to signify infidelity and recalcitrant Jewishness".|$|R
50|$|In Greek Myth, Cadmus {{was forced}} to do eight years of penance for slaying the serpent of Ares, {{but he was not}} turned into a snake himself until many years later (after he {{completed}} his penance). In the game, the hero who slays the <b>serpent</b> is immediately <b>turned</b> into a snake.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{returned}} Morgan, {{with his}} bitterest emphasis. [...] "It doesn't surprise {{me in the}} least. It's the way things go in this world--it's the regular moral see-saw of good and evil--the old story with the old end to it. They were too happy {{in the garden of}} Eden--down comes the <b>serpent</b> and <b>turns</b> them out. Solomon was too wise--down comes the Queen of Sheba, and makes a fool of him. We've been too comfortable at The Glen Tower--down comes a woman, and sets us all three by the ears together. All I wonder at is that it hasn't happened before." [...] With those words Morgan resignedly took out his pipe, put on his old felt hat and turned to the door.|$|R
50|$|St Hilda's School {{was founded}} in 1912, when the Diocese of Brisbane of the Anglican Church of Australia {{purchased}} an older school, Goyte-Lea, from Miss Davenport. Goyte-Lea was established prior to Australian federation in the late 19th century. The School was named after the seventh century Abbess of Whitby Saint Hilda. Saint Hilda {{was said to have}} <b>turned</b> <b>serpents</b> into stone, and three stone serpents are the emblem of the school's crest.|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of the 10th day, he went to Mt. Zinghmuh and hid himself in a place where he {{considered}} to be the most likely places traversed by Dead Soul’s Highway. He also placed some ashes on the path so that he could see the foot print of her daughter. Some hours after nightfall, he heard the sound of khingte “”i.e. the string of tiny ornamental brass bells worn by Chin girls around their hips””, coming toward him from one direction. He quickly recognized that it was the ringing of his daughter’s khingte as he always heard them when she used to walk briskly when she was alive. The sounds came nearer and nearer to him but he couldn’t see his daughter, nor could he see anything. When the sound reached the spot on the pass where he had spread a layer of ash, he saw a footprint which he quickly recognized as the footmarks of his daughter. Just before the ringing of khingte disappeared, he sprang from his hiding place and gripped the empty air. But instead of catching his haughtier he found that he had caught a huge and fearsome caterpillar, the size of a human. Being in his arms, and the big caterpillar was struggling to free itself from his grip. But knowing that it was his daughter he refused to let go his grip, but held it still firmer. A moment later, the caterpillar turned itself into a huge serpent. Though, the serpent tried to free itself from his grip {{while at the same time}} trying to strangle him the man continued to tighten his grip. At last, realizing that there was no use in continuing the struggle, the <b>serpent</b> <b>turned</b> itself into his daughter Dar Luan.|$|R
5000|$|Cronus (voiced by David Kaye) - The main {{antagonist}} of the series. Cronus's character {{combines the}} roles of Cronus: King of the Titans and Chronos: Personification of Time. Cronus was imprisoned since the Titanomachy in Tartarus by his sons Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. With the aligning of the planets on New Year's Eve, {{he is able to}} escape and exact revenge on Zeus and the Olympians as well as take over the world. Having harbored such long-standing grudges, Cronus often has no trouble persuading his allies to take out their anger on the heroes' modern descendants. He also controls a number of giants and has been known to form alliances with the old foes of the original heroes. As {{one of the most powerful}} immortals in existence, Cronus has numerous powers including using his blood to create sea <b>serpents,</b> <b>turning</b> his minions into hairy six-legged anteater creatures, super healing, creating portals to escape through when he's cornered, shape shifting, shooting red beams that induce unconsciousness, and creating duplicates of himself. As the god of time, he is able to reverse and speed up time, as well as move himself and others through time, and hold it at a standstill; time travel visibly weakens his powers immensely when used often. It is notable that unlike the gods, Cronus does not rely on the tree of immortality to remain alive because he is a Titan and was present prior to the gods. He wields two golden (in mythology, adamantine) scythes that materialize out of thin air. To blend in with the modern world, Cronus dresses in a black business suit, but other than that, Cronus wears a black toga and gold bracelets.|$|R
5000|$|Guided by Ulf's directions, Conan goes {{in search}} of the priest of Set. The center of the <b>serpent</b> plague <b>turns</b> out to be Ludya's native village, and the [...] "priest" [...] Lar, the boy from the prologue, the plague's first victim. He is evidently acting as the agent of some outside supernatural entity. Conan finds Ludya and frees her from the cult's control; she fills in the missing pieces of the puzzle. To get near the boy, both feign they are under the {{influence}} of the plague. Their wariness proves wise when Lar sheds his skin and reveals himself as a reptilian monstrosity which Conan, in revulsion, impulsively batters to death. With Lar's demise his ensorceled army goes to pieces; some of his followers, now revealed as animated corpses, rapidly decomposing, while the madmen composing the remainder reawaken to sanity.|$|R
5000|$|Tom Thumb first {{encountered}} the Avengers years ago. With the Squadron Supreme and the Avengers, he battled Brain-Child. With the Squadron, he fell under {{control of the}} Serpent Cartel. The Squadron battled the Avengers {{on behalf of the}} <b>Serpent</b> Cartel, then <b>turned</b> against the Cartel. Alongside the other Squadron members, he became mind-controlled by the Over-Mind. He was used along with the other members as pawns in the Over-Mind's conquest of [...] "Other-Earth," [...] but was freed by the Defenders. With the Squadron and Defenders, he battled and defeated the Over-Mind and Null, the Living Darkness.|$|R
6000|$|With {{corresponding}} impulse, {{the serpent}} split his train into a fork, while the man drew his legs {{together into a}} train; {{the skin of the}} serpent grew soft, while the man's hardened; the serpent acquired tresses of hair, the man grew hairless; the claws of the one projected into legs, while the arms of the other withdrew into his shoulders; the face of the serpent, as it rose from the ground, retreated towards the temples, pushing out human ears; that of the man, as he fell to the ground, thrust itself forth into a muzzle, withdrawing at the same time its ears into its head, as the slug does its horns; and each creature kept its impious eyes fixed on the other's, while the features beneath the eyes were changing. The soul which had become the <b>serpent</b> then <b>turned</b> to crawl away, hissing in scorn as he departed; and the serpent, which had become the man, spat after him, and spoke words at him. The new human-looking soul then turned his back on his late adversary, and said to the third spirit, who remained unchanged, [...] "Let Buoso now take to his crawl, as I have done." ...|$|R
5000|$|Similar to this in {{that the}} igneous element was {{obtained}} from snakes, {{but on the other}} hand suggesting aflinities with the fire-quest of the Polynesian Maui, is a myth current in New Britain. There was once a time when the Sulka were ignorant of fire; but one day a man named Emakong lost one of his ornaments, which fell into a stream. Taking off his loin-cloth he jumped in and dove to recover the lost object, but was amazed, on reaching the bottom, to find himself in the yard of a house. Many people came up and asked him his name, and when he replied that he was called Emakong, one of them said, [...] "Oh, that is also my name," [...] whereupon he took the bewildered man to his house and gave him a new loin-cloth. Great was Emakong's astonishment to see a fire in the house. At first he was afraid of it, but after he had been given cooked food and had found this much better than the raw viands which he had always eaten before, he lost his fear of the new thing. When it became night, the crickets began to sing and this also alarmed him, for in the world above there was no night, and crickets were unknown. His terror became still greater, however, when he heard resounding claps of thunder from every side and saw all the people turn into snakes in order to sleep. His namesake reassured him, however, and said that he need not fear, for this was their custom, and that when day should come again, all would return to their human form. Then, with a loud report, he also changed into a snake, and Emakong alone retained the shape of man. In the morning, when the birds sang to announce the coming day, he awoke, and with a crash all the <b>serpents</b> again <b>turned</b> into men. His namesake now did up a package for him, containing night, some fire, some crickets, and the birds that sing at dawn, and with this Imakong left, rising through the water. On reaching the shore, he threw the fire into dry grass, but when the people saw the blaze and heard the crackling of the flame, they were greatly alarmed and all fled. Emakong, however, ran after them and telling them of his adventures, explained to them the use of the things that he had brought.|$|R
