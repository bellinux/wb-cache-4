This paper deals with preparing UHPC mixes by using amorphous <b>silicium</b> <b>dioxide</b> nanoparticles specially synthesized by applying the sol-gel method.

40|$|Because of {{the size}} of the nanoparticles, their {{detection}} and exact anatomical localization in tissue samples are very difficult. Consequently, suitable methods are needed to prove their presence, especially co-localized to histological lesions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether nanoparticles were detectable in specimens after reprocessing samples from glass slides using the pop-off technique. Tissue slides containing agglomerates of titanium dioxide nanoparticles already visible on a light microscopic level and amorphous <b>silicium</b> <b>dioxide</b> (SiO 2) particles not observable in tissue slides were reprocessed. Furthermore, cytospots of bronchoalveolar lavage acquired from rats that previously inhaled carbon nanotubes were used. After reprocessing the samples, they were investigated using transmission electron microscopy. In all the reprocessed samples, the respective nanoparticles were detectable. Even the light microscopically invisible amorphous SiO 2 particles were observed as electron dense structures. Titanium and silicium were additionally confirmed in the respective nanoparticles by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). In summary, the pop-off technique represents a fast and easy way to detect nanoparticles in histological sections. This enables further characterization of these particles by additional techniques such as EDX, and their direct correlation with light microscopic lesions at exactly the same location is investigated...|$|R

The three point bending test according to SCHWICKERATH was used to determinate the bond strength of test specimens (seven for each parameter). Before the five ceramic firing cycles the test specimens were coated with zirconium dioxide, aluminium oxide, silicon dioxide or titanium dioxide. Seven test specimens for every coating procedure were stored in water, dry or were thermo cycled. Together with the uncoated control group 168 test specimens were investigated. The results revealed the following: An improvement of the bond strength due to the coatings with several oxides was not observable. The values were in every case above the recommended 25 MPa. The storage in water or thermo cycling had no influence on the bond strength of uncoated, titanium dioxide or zirconium dioxide coated test specimens. In contrast aluminium oxide or <b>silicium</b> <b>dioxide</b> coated test specimens exhibited decreasing bond strengths under those conditions. The element distribution of elements in the bonding zone was investigated with an scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX).

40|$|Methane is {{the most}} {{abundant}} organic greenhouse gas in our atmosphere, and has a strong infrared absorbance, being 25 to 30 times more effective than carbon dioxide on a 100 years scale. Methane therefore {{plays an important role}} in the climate warming regulation. Methanotrophs are microorganisms that can consume methane and utilize it as their sole source of carbon and energy. These organisms are the most important biological sink of methane. Their importance is especially demonstrated in marine ecosystems. While the oceans have the potential to produce enormous quantities of methane, a series of very effective microbiological oxidation processes results in the ocean being one of the smallest net global methane sources. Hence, it is of vital importance to understand who is there and what factors may positively or negatively impact the methane-oxidizing activity of these organisms. Despite the importance of the aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria (MOB) in the marine ecosystems currently only a limited amount of ex situ cultures is available. Nevertheless, they are indispensable to link physiology to genomic features and expand our knowledge about the specific habitat preferences of marine MOB. This study focused on aerobic marine MOBs and aimed at designing a large-scale enrichment and isolation strategy to retrieve a maximal MOB diversity from marine sediments. First, the effect of adhesion material and headspace composition on the methane oxidation activity in marine sediment enrichments were investigated. The addition of sterilized natural sediment as well as acid-washed <b>silicium</b> <b>dioxide</b> significantly positively influenced methane oxidation. The exact mechanism of this positive effect needs further investigation but might be the facilitation of methane, carbon dioxide and oxygen gradients in addition to adhesion. Use of adhesion material might thus facilitate the cultivation and subsequent enrichment of members of this functional guild. Next, using these insights, a large scale isolation strategy was performed from sediment collected at six different stations in the North Sea along a transect from estuary to open sea. An initial enrichment step with serial subcultivations was followed by miniaturized extinction culturing mimicking a range of nitrogen and oxygen microniches. A clear decreasing trend of cultivability and detectability was observed along the investigated transect. Furthermore widely applied pmoA primers failed to amplify biomarkers in a large number of active methanotrophic cultures, suggesting enormous underestimation of methanotrophs in situ in PCR-based molecular surveys. Unfortunately, despite the numerous attempts we were not able to obtain axenic methanotrophic cultures, most likely due to tight mutualistic interactions with heterotrophic bacteria. Shot gun sequencing of four methane-oxidizing enrichment cultures revealed the presence of a novel gammaproteobacterial MOB belonging to the deep-sea cluster 2 in two cultures and a novel alphaproteobacterial MOB belonging to the recently described methylotrophic genus Methyloceanibacter in the other two cultures. Methyloceanibacter methanicus represented the first MOB found in an exclusively methylotrophic genus, the first marine type II MOB and only the third taxon in which solely sMMO was resoponsible for methane oxidation. A targeted isolation using methanol as carbon source led to a axenic culture of the MOB, in addition to three closely related novel strict methylotrophic species, M. superfactum, M. stevinii, M. marginalis. Together with the previously described M. caenitepidi, these species exemplify an extreme niche differentiation, with a wide ecotypic variation related to growth kinetics on methanol, and preferences for nitrogen, pH, temperature and salt. Furthermore, the most striking difference of the deep-sea cluster 2 representatives demonstrated a striking difference with other gammaproteobacterial MOB in its lack of a calcium dependent methanol dehydrogenase encoded in the genome. The genome solely contained the genes for xoxF 5 for the lanthanide-containing methanol dehydrogenase. Lastly, a preservation protocol was optimized for the long term storage of marine bacteria in order to successfully store the enrichments and axenic cultures obtained throughout this dissertation. Fastidious nitrite-oxidizing bacteria were used as model organisms. They demonstrated that optimal preservation conditions were strain-dependent whereby marine strains, appeared to be more sensitive to freezing than non-marine strains. Nevertheless, a general cryopreservation protocol using 10 % dimethyl sulfoxide as cryoprotective agent with or without ten-fold diluted trypticase soy broth and trehalose as a preservation medium allowed successful preservation of all tested strains. Applying the same protocol on whole marine sediment samples allowed successful storage of different key players in the carbon and nitrogen cycle. In conclusion marine MOBs are notoriously difficult to cultivate and isolate. Despite numerous attempts, I was only able obtain one axenic culture, in addition to over 200 enrichment cultures, from the oxygenated zones of North Sea sediments. The availability of a successful preservation protocol allows the storage of this axenic culture, ensuring that novel diversity does not get lost, but also further guaranties archiving of the obtained enrichment cultures and environmental samples. As such these are available for future isolation when novel insights in marine MOB and isolation strategies/techniques become available...|$|R
40|$|Synthetisch hergestelltes Siliziumdioxid (SiO 2) im Submikro- und Nanopartikelmaßstab findet bereits in Farben und Lacken, sowie in Kunst- und Klebstoffen Einsatz, um deren Brillanz, Kratz- und Kohäsionsfestigkeit zu verbessern. Die gute Verfügbarkeit und der geringe Preis des SiO 2 machen es für viele Anwendungen zu einem interessanten Füllstoff. Ziel dieser Arbeit war es, durch werkstoffwissenschaftliche, grundlagenorientierte Betrachtungen ein tieferes Verständnis für die Funktionsmechanismen von modifizierten SiO 2 -Partikeln in einer EP-Matrix zu erlangen und eine Verbesserung der tribologischen Eigenschaften (Reibungskoeffizient und Verschleißrate) der Komposite zu erreichen. Der erste Teil dieser Arbeit befasst sich mit der Herstellung und Charakterisierung von modifizierten Siliziumdioxid-Partikeln mittels eines modifizierten Stöberprozess. Es wurden die Katalysatoren Ammoniak, Tetramethylammoniumhydroxid (TMAH) und Tetramethylethylendiamin (TMED) getestet. Als Referenz wurden kommerziell erhältliche SiO 2 -Nanopartikel (Aerosil 200) sowie ein ebenfalls kommerziell erhältliches Partikelgemisch (NanoVit) als Füllstoffe getestet. Zur Ermittlung der tribologischen Eigenschaften wurde an den Kompositen eine Gleitverschleißuntersuchung (Stift-auf-Scheibe (PoD)) mit unterschiedlichen Parametervarianten (Geschwindigkeit-/Druckvariationen) durchgeführt. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass die modifizierten SiO 2 -Partikel einen positiven Einfluss auf die tribologischen Eigenschaften der EP-Komposite haben. Weiter konnte bewiesen werden, dass durch die Zugabe der neu synthetisierten SiO 2 -Partikel auf eine Zugabe von Graphit als Schmiermittel verzichtet werden kann. Auch wurde festgestellt, dass durch das Eleminieren des Graphites sich ein sehr dünner Gleitfilm auf dem Gegenkörper ausbildete, der als ein Indiz für die Ursache der Verbesserung des Reibwertes gelten kann. Ein Prozess für dieses Kompositverhalten wurde in dieser Arbeit postuliert. resins (EP), are {{increasingly}} being used as templates {{for the development of}} anti-wear coatings and composites. An improvement in the tribological properties of EP composite materials is thus of great importance. As a basic functionalization for high performance EP composites micro scale short carbon fibers (SCFs) and micro scale graphite are being utilized. In the last years the use of nanomaterials as fillers in polymer matrices has started to increase. A common way to produce nanoreinforced polymer composites is to purchase microagglomerates with a primary particle size on the nanoscale directly from the market, to transfer those particles into the respective polymer matrix and to destroy those microagglomerates by the application of various “milling techniques”. In case of thermosets e. g. epoxy resins dissolver techniques like a torus mill are applied, in case of thermoplastics a twin screw extruder will be used. At the end of the “milling process” a broad distribution of nanoparticles as well as remaining microagglomerates are present in the respective polymer matrix. Therefore an exactly controlled synthesis of defined and homogenously controlled particle sizes is not given. In order to obtain such nano- or submicroparticles respectively the so called bottom-up method has to be applied. The basis of this method are molecules e. g. tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) which will be condensed in alkaline medium to aggregates with a defined particle size by using stabilizing agents and temperature control. Nanoparticles such as titanium <b>dioxide</b> (TiO 2), <b>silicium</b> <b>dioxide</b> (SiO 2), zinc oxide (ZnO) or molybdeniumdisulfide (MoS 2) are now an important part of industrial materials. Silicon dioxide (quartz) is caused by dehydration of silicic acid {{and is one of the}} hardest natural materials. To synthesize this material as nanoparticles, to use it as fillers in composites, offers a high potential for the creation of new nanomaterial composites. The good availability and low price of silica make it attractive for many applications. Synthetically produced SiO 2 in the sub-micron and nano-scale can already be found in paints and varnishes, plastics and adhesives to use boost their brilliance, as well as to improve scratch resistance and cohesive strength. Depending on the desired particle properties and production rates, a suitable production method must be selected from the large number of possible processes to generate the perfect nanoparticles. One challenge is the transfer of these manufacturing processes from the laboratory to an industrial scale. Here the sol-gel process takes an attractive position for synthesizing innovative nanoscale SiO 2 particles. The aim of this work is to stabilize the Stöber process for producing SiO 2 nanoparticles, so that it allows a scale-up in the industrial scale, without significant changes in the SiO 2 particles quality. The SiO 2 particles are controlled during the synthesis in terms of their shape and size. For this purpose, SiO 2 particles with two different stabilizers, Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and Tetramethylethylenediamine (TMED) are manufactured. A SiO 2 particle growth law is defined by which carefully coordinated synthesis parameters (concentration, temperature and pH) homogeneous, monodispersed particles can be produced with a defined particle size between 50 nm and 700 nm (± 10 nm). These particles are characterized by analytical methods (IR spectroscopy, DLS analysis, SEM images, NMR spectroscopy and BET measurements). The SiO 2 particles, which have been produced with the aid of the stabilizer TMAH, show a higher concentration of silanol groups in their structure. After ensuring the controlled SiO 2 - manufacturing process, the particles thus produced are used as filling material for EP composites. With the modified Stöber SiO 2 particles in combination with SCF and graphite, the tribological properties (coefficient of friction and wear) of the EP- composites should be improved. After the production of the SiO 2 particles, these are introduced, differentiated by their different size in an EP- matrix. In addition to provide a reference the fillers SCF and graphite can be tested in an EP matrix as well. These composites are now being analyzed by the tribological pin-on-ring method in terms of wear values. In the next step EP composites are produced which include the best SiO 2 particle sizes from the previous chapter together with SCF and graphite as filler materials to create better tribological properties. After this they were characterized by the pin-on-disc method with respect to their wear rate and coefficient of friction. A commercially available SiO 2 nanoparticle (Aerosil 200) as filler is used in an EP composites in the next chapter as a reference. This composite is compared to two other composites containing the self-produced SiO 2 particles, wherein both types differ by the choice of the stabilizer used during the synthesis. In the last section of this work a composite in which a commercially available filler mix (NanoVit) is included were tested, compared with a composite with the best previously determined fillers. It is shown that the modified SiO 2 particles have a positive effect on the tribological characteristics of the EP-composites. They produce a lower coefficient of friction and improved wear performance. It is also proven that by adding the newly synthesized SiO 2 particles the addition of graphite as a lubricant is no longer relevant. Furthermore, it is proven that by eliminating the graphite a very thin film of lubricant on the counter body is formed which is an indication of the cause of improving the coefficient of friction. A process for this behavior is postulated. ...|$|R
