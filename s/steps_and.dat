40|$|Abstract — Abstract: <b>Step</b> <b>and</b> touch {{voltages}} play {{an important}} role when designing high voltage substation. <b>Step</b> <b>and</b> touch potentials near high voltage substation due to severe ground faults present a hazard to anyone in proximity to substation when a fault occurs. A primary issue of concern is hazardous <b>step</b> <b>and</b> touch voltage is that arise during fault situations, hence a reliable and efficient solution to the problem is essential. Although personnel safety is of primary concern, effect of electric current, resistance of the human body and tolerable voltage criteria considerations are also essential in the design system to ensure the protection of personnel and equipment.

5|$|At a {{memorial}} service held on 8 September 1978 for Flight 825's passengers and crew at Salisbury's Anglican Cathedral, about 2,000 people crowded inside, with another 500 standing outside on the <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> pavement, many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets. Prominent among those present in the cathedral were uniformed Air Rhodesia and South African Airways personnel, as well as Rhodesian Special Air Service soldiers and senior officers from other military units. Smith and several government ministers also attended, including PK van der Byl, the co-Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
5|$|Echols {{recalled}} {{that the first}} scenes shot were those of Madonna walking down Lenox Avenue. While filming, the singer noticed a black leather coat with fur trim, worn by Fatima, the assistant director. Madonna asked for the coat from Fatima and ended up wearing it in the video. Echols also noted that Madonna had {{a close relationship with}} the cinematographer, and knew from which angle her shots would be the best and which lights to be used. After the misunderstandings regarding looks and the plot direction were cleared, the filming resumed and was finished within three days. The final scenes were with model Jason Olive in a Marlem house, with Madonna climbing <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> reaching him and their supposed child.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{determine}} what steps occur in these pathways. Without enzymes, metabolism would neither {{progress through the}} same <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> could not be regulated to {{serve the needs of}} the cell. Most central metabolic pathways are regulated at a few key steps, typically through enzymes whose activity involves the hydrolysis of ATP. Because this reaction releases so much energy, other reactions that are thermodynamically unfavorable can be coupled to ATP hydrolysis, driving the overall series of linked metabolic reactions.|$|E

5|$|Harvey Wippleman was at ringside {{with the}} urn as the Undertaker faced Giant Gonzalez. The two wrestlers brawled, using the ring <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> steel chairs.

5|$|In 1861 a {{proposal}} {{was made to}} construct a road from Blackfriars to the Mansion House; this {{would have resulted in}} the complete demolition of the College. However, protests from the heralds resulted in only parts of the south east and south west wings being sliced off, requiring extensive remodelling. The College was now a three-sided building with an open courtyard facing the New Queen Victoria Street laid out in 1866. The terrace, <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> entrance porch were also added around this time.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, {{the celebration}} of 200 years since {{the arrival of the}} First Fleet was {{organised}} on a large scale, with many significant events taking place in all major cities. Over 2.5million people attended the event in Sydney. These included street parties, concerts, including performances on the <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> forecourt of the Sydney Opera House and at many other public venues, art and literary competitions, historic re-enactments, and the opening of the Powerhouse Museum at its new location. A re-enactment of the arrival of the First Fleet took place in Sydney Harbour, with ships that had sailed from Portsmouth a year earlier taking part.|$|E

5|$|Mass {{transfer}} diffusion {{takes place}} in the case where adparticle sources and traps such as kinks, <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> vacancies are present. Instead of being dependent only on the jump potential barrier Ediff, diffusion in this regime is now also dependent on the formation energy of mobile adparticles. The exact nature of the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the diffusion rate, since the formation energy of an adparticle is different for each type of surface feature as is described in the Terrace Ledge Kink model.|$|E
5|$|Other {{recognized}} motor {{signs and}} symptoms include gait and posture disturbances such as festination (rapid shuffling <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> a forward-flexed posture when walking with no flexed arm swing). Freezing of gait (brief arrests when the feet seem to get stuck to the floor, especially on turning or changing direction), a slurred monotonous quiet voice, mask-like facial expression, and handwriting that gets smaller and smaller are other common signs.|$|E
