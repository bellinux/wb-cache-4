500|$|Bussolari's {{denial that}} she had {{discussed}} any baptism with Morisi {{raised the question of}} who could have reported the rumours to the inquisitor in the first place. On 6 March, Carboni interviewed Morisi again and pointed out the inconsistencies between her story and the testimony of the Mortara family doctor, the Mortaras themselves, and both Lepori and Bussolari. She replied: [...] "It's the Gospel truth". Carboni put it to Morisi that she might have invented the whole <b>story</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> spite against the Mortara family {{in the hope that the}} Church might reward her. When Carboni asked Morisi if she had been to San Domenico apart from for her interrogation, she stated {{that she had}} been there on two other occasions to try to secure a dowry from Father Feletti. Carboni suggested that Morisi must have herself prompted the interrogation by recounting Edgardo's baptism during one of these visits—Morisi insisted that the interrogation had been first and the other two visits later.|$|E
500|$|Forty-year-old Guy Trilby discovers a {{loophole}} in the Golden Quill Spelling Bee which stipulates that participants must have not {{graduated from the}} eighth grade, allowing him to enter since {{he dropped out of}} middle school. He attends and wins a regional spelling bee, and progresses to the national competition after confrontations with both the parents of children and the spelling bee hosts. He is accompanied by Jenny Widgeon, a relatively unknown journalist hoping to make a <b>story</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his participation in the bee. On the flight to the national spelling bee, Guy meets Chaitanya Chopra, a 10-year-old entrant in the bee who persistently attempts to befriend Guy. Upon his arrival in Los Angeles, Guy meets the director of the spelling bee, Dr. Bernice Deagan, who expresses anger at his participation in the bee and places him and his reporter in a cheap hotel. Guy learns that Chaitanya is staying in the same hotel, and takes him out one night to expose Chaitanya to the wilder side of life: stealing food, drinking, and hiring a prostitute to briefly [...] "flash" [...] Chaitanya.|$|E
500|$|Literary critic John Kenneth Muir {{felt the}} script had many plot-holes left many {{unanswered}} questions, {{and that there}} was [...] "little effort to forge a coherent <b>story</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the mix". New York Daily News writer David Bianculli described Laserblast as [...] "numbingly bad". In The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction Movies, Phil Hardy describes it as [...] "a wholly unimaginative film", adding, [...] "Even the non-stop series of exploding cars becomes monotonous in the hands of director Rae." [...] The Time Out Film Guide described Laserblast as a rip-off of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and said Billy's reign of destruction seemed random and senseless rather than driven by plot or characterization. The review called the film [...] "the epitome of what Frank Zappa once hymned as 'cheapness. The Globe and Mail writer Robert Martin called the script inept, said Steve Neill's make-up effects were [...] "frightful rather than frightening", and said Cheryl Smith could [...] "barely talk, let alone act". [...] Martin also stated the film was pulled from a Toronto theater after showing for one week.|$|E

Her attempt {{to craft a}} news <b>story</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the situation lands her {{a job at the}} Daily Planet—in the basement alongside her cousin Chloe. While at the Daily Planet, Lois begins a new relationship with her editor Grant Gabriel (Michael Cassidy) in the episode [...] "Wrath". Their relationship comes under scrutiny from Chloe and Lex in [...] "Blue", with Chloe seeing it as a reason for co-workers to doubt Lois's true ability as a journalist, and Lex believing it will jeopardize the secret of Grant's true identity. In [...] "Gemini", the two finally agree to part ways. In the season eight premiere, Lois believes that Lex is responsible for Chloe's arrest by the Department of Domestic Security, and goes to his mansion to search his files for her location. She eventually discovers Chloe's whereabouts and arrives, alongside Clark, to save her. In [...] "Plastique", Lois takes Clark under her wing—teaching him how to be a reporter—after he accepts an internship at the Daily Planet, sitting at the desk directly across from Lois. Her feelings for Clark become stronger as the season progresses, admitting in the episode [...] "Committed" [...] that she is in love with Clark, and stating to Oliver in the episode [...] "Bride" [...] that she has never felt this way about someone before. In the same episode, she almost shares a kiss with Clark before being interrupted by the arrival of Clark's ex-girlfriend Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk). In the season eight finale, Lois and Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman), Lex Luthor's handpicked successor to LuthorCorp, get into a physical fight at the Daily Planet. During the fight, Lois picks up a Legion ring that falls out of Clark's desk and is instantly transported to another time and place.|$|E
500|$|Elaborating on the series' costumes, Carol Case, {{who also}} served as costume {{designer}} on Fargo, explained that she [...] "didn’t want anyone to be too locked into that 60s feel, because we were ultimately going for a ‘no period’ look." [...] Case took the series' color palette from [...] "60s rock bands—the golds and yellows and oranges and greens ... Noah said {{he wanted it to}} look like David was rescued by The Kinks". She then assigned colors from that palette to each lead character: Barrett wears orange and black; Carry and Kerry Loudermilk wear mostly navy and tan; Melanie Bird wear beige and pastel colors to [...] "convey her role as a caretaker"; and Haller wears different blues and greys, though his palette was [...] "more open than others’, given that his character {{is a bit of a}} work in progress." [...] Case sourced clothing from various vintage stores, but created other pieces from scratch, including all of the costumes worn by Katie Aselton which [...] "are more deeply rooted in the Swinging Sixties aesthetic than others." [...] The pink beanies worn by members of Division 3 were knitted by Case's sister and her friends for the series. Case deliberately avoided referencing any costumes from the comics [...] "to take this <b>story</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> where people think it sits". For the patients of Clockworks Psychiatric Hospital, Case initially used [...] "a bunch of space-age-y looks that didn’t feel right", before settling on tracksuits with exaggerated collars to give them a [...] "futuristic feel". The orange tracksuits include colored stripes to indicate the seriousness of each patient's diagnosis, ranging from white stripes for Barrett ("which puts her in the ‘least crazy’ category"), to yellow stripes for [...] "moderate" [...] Haller, and red stripes for Busker which [...] "basically means she’s never getting out of there." [...] Busker's costumes evolve throughout the series to reflect her changing role, going from the orange and red focus to black and [...] "businessy" [...] clothes to show that [...] "She’s got a job to do, and she’s determined to do it." [...] Her design then become [...] "unhinged"; eventually she wears a twizzler as a collar bar, after being seen eating them throughout the season.|$|E
2500|$|Hobson {{proposed}} the activation-synthesis theory, {{which states that}} [...] "there is a randomness of dream imagery and the randomness synthesizes dream-generated images to fit the patterns of internally generated stimulations". This theory {{is based on the}} physiology of REM sleep, and Hobson believes dreams are the outcome of the forebrain reacting to random activity beginning at the brainstem. The activation-synthesis theory hypothesizes that the peculiar nature of dreams is attributed to certain parts of the brain trying to piece together a <b>story</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> what is essentially bizarre information.|$|E

However, it cited that, [...] "the camerawork is generally uninspiring, the same two or three movements played out over and over. But it manages to delight much more than it disappoints.

2500|$|This {{was soon}} {{followed}} {{by his first}} major success, {{and one of his}} most popular novels, Singoalla (1858), a [...] "romantic <b>story</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Middle Ages, permeated with a poetic nature-mysticism, about the tragic love between a knight and a gypsy girl." [...] Rydberg rewrote the book throughout his life. The fourth and final edition of 1894, concludes with Erland dying as a hermit monk. The story has been made into a film twice, and today, a popular brand of cookie takes its name from the book's main character: Singoalla. A review of the first English translation of the work in the Saga-Book of the Viking Club, Vol. 4, Part 1, 1904–5, noting that the book [...] "has already been translated into most of the languages of continental Europe", remarks that [...] "Singoalla is a novel occupying a pre-eminent place among Rydberg's prose writings." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Music" [...] had {{the longest}} {{production}} time to date for a Sakanaction single, as Yamaguchi had difficulty finalizing the song's lyrics. Yamaguchi challenged himself {{to write the}} lyrics unconsciously, creating a <b>story</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the lyrics that spontaneously occurred to him while listening to the song's melody. The first draft had a strong story to it, but Yamaguchi felt that because the story needed too much explanation to understand abandoned these plans. Yamaguchi {{wanted to write a}} song describing how Sakanaction as a band look toward music, and expressed musically what type of band Sakanaction were in that moment. While Yamaguchi was struggling with the song's lyrics, Sakanaction's manager gave them the news that one of their songs would be used for the theme song of the drama Dinner. As he was struggling to find a lyrical theme for the song, Yamaguchi read the screenplays for the first three episodes of the drama; finding professionalism to be an overarching theme to the work. Instead of relating the song to the drama's cooking-focused theme, Yamaguchi decided to write the song about his own professionalism, from his perspective as a musician.|$|E
