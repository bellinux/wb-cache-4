60|$|Futilely protesting, Sprague and Stine were bundled on board. For half an hour, with axes, Kit and Shorty {{struggled}} {{to cut a}} way into the swift but <b>solid</b> <b>stream.</b> When they did succeed in clearing the shore-ice, the floating ice forced the boat along the edge for a hundred yards, tearing away half of one gunwale and making a partial wreck of it. Then, {{at the lower end}} of the bend, they caught the current that flung off-shore. They proceeded to work farther toward the middle. The stream was no longer composed of mush-ice but of hard cakes. In between the cakes only was mush-ice, that froze solidly as they looked at it. Shoving with the oars against the cakes, sometimes climbing out on the cakes in order to force the boat along, after an hour they gained the middle. Five minutes after they ceased their exertions, the boat was frozen in. The whole river was coagulating as it ran. Cake froze to cake, until at last the boat was the center of a cake seventy-five feet in diameter. Sometimes they floated sideways, sometimes stern-first, while gravity tore asunder the forming fetters in the moving mass, only to be manacled by faster-forming ones. While the hours passed, Shorty stoked the stove, cooked meals, and chanted his war-song.|$|E

For example, [...] "0100 0001" [...] would become [...] "1 0100 0001 0".

This method of transmission is used when data are sent intermittently as opposed to in a <b>solid</b> <b>stream.</b> In the previous example the start and stop bits are in bold. The start and stop bits must be of opposite polarity. This allows the receiver to recognize when the second packet of information is being sent.|$|E

5000|$|These are fires whose fuel is {{flammable}} or {{combustible liquid}} or gas. The US system designates all such fires [...] "Class B". In the European/Australian system, flammable liquids are designated [...] "Class B" [...] having flash point less than 100 °F, while burning gases are separately designated [...] "Class C". These fires {{follow the same}} basic fire tetrahedron (heat, fuel, oxygen, chemical reaction) as ordinary combustible fires, except that the fuel in question is a flammable liquid such as gasoline, or gas such as natural gas. A <b>solid</b> <b>stream</b> of water should never be used to extinguish this type because it can cause the fuel to scatter, spreading the flames. The {{most effective way to}} extinguish a liquid or gas fueled fire is by inhibiting the chemical chain reaction of the fire, which is done by dry chemical and Halon extinguishing agents, although smothering with CO2 or, for liquids, foam is also effective. Halon has fallen out of favor in recent times because it is an ozone-depleting material; the Montreal Protocol declares that Halon should no longer be used.

40|$|Modern {{wastewater}} treatment plants now produce more waste activated sludge, with low inherent treatability, due to a shift in focus towards nutrient removal rather than only sanitation. Food industry and abattoirs also produce significant volumes of waste solids. Organics in these <b>solids</b> <b>streams</b> can be readily converted to energy by anaerobic processes, which generate renewable methane. Conventional anaerobic processes require readily degradable substrates for the best outcomes. However, the degradability of long sludge-age activated sludge is normally poor, resulting in long digester hydraulic retention time (HRT), high mixing costs and poor methane production. To enhance the sludge degradability, incorporating a pre-treatment prior to conventional anaerobic digestion has been used and proven as a promising method.

5000|$|According to one report, {{the high}} {{inflation}} during the 1970s {{combined with the}} restrictive rent control policies in the city meant that buildings were worth more dead for the insurance money than alive as sources of rental income; as investments, they had limited ability to provide a <b>solid</b> <b>stream</b> of rental income. Accordingly, there was an economic incentive {{on the part of}} building owners, according to this view, to simply let the buildings burn. An alternative view was that the fires were a result of the city's municipal policies. While there are differing views about whether planned shrinkage caused fire outbreaks in the 1970s, or was a result of such fires, there is agreement that the fires in the South Bronx during these years were extensive. In the South Bronx, the average number of people per fireengine is over 44,000. In Staten Island, it's 17,000. There is no standard for manning areas of multiple dwellings as opposed to one- and two-family residences. A New York City battalion chief from the New York City Fire Department interviewed in the BBC-TV special [...] "The Bronx is Burning," [...] in 1976. By the mid-1970s, The Bronx had 120,000 fires per year, for an average of 30 fires every 2 hours. 40 percent of the housing in the area was destroyed. The response time for fires also increased, as the firefighters did not have the resources to keep responding promptly to numerous service calls. A report in The New York Post suggested that the cause of the fires was not arson but resulted from decisions by bureaucrats to abandon sections of the city. According to one report, of the 289 census tracts within the borough of the Bronx, seven census tracts lost more than 97% of their buildings, and 44 tracts lost more than 50% of their buildings, to fire and abandonment.|$|E
