40|$|Surge is an {{aerodynamic}} flow instability {{which can}} lead to the catastrophic failure of the compressor sys-tem. One way to cope with this compressor flow instability is active control. For a laboratory-scale gas turbine installation, an active <b>surge</b> <b>control</b> system is proposed which consists of a plenum pressure sensor and a bleedhecycle valve. This work focuses on the selection of a <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> More specifically, the required bandwidth and capacity of the valve are specified. To study the influence of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on system behavior, simulations are done with the Greitzer model which describes the behavior of the nonlinear compression system during surge. This model is extended with a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> model which accounts for the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics and the effect of valve saturation. A linear static output feedback controller is used to stabilize the compression system around its nominal operating point. The main contributions of this study are the following. First, a systematic approach is presented to deter-mine the required bandwidth and capacity of a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for active <b>surge</b> <b>control.</b> Second, an efficient control strategy is applied: one-sided control. In this control strategy, the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is nominally closed and only opens to stabilize the system in its nominal operating point. Third, a stability analysis of the constrained linearized compression system is presented. Using the bounded static output feedback controller, surge limit cycles are stabilized in the nominal operat-ing point. Stable operation can be sustained in this point with zero <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> mass flow if disturbances are absent. From simulations, the minimal bandwidth and capacity of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> needed for stabi-lization are determined. Surge point mass flow is seen to reduce by approximately 15 % with the applied one-sided control strategy. Furthermore, it is concluded that nonlinear flow curves of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> are unfavorable for active <b>surge</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 51 - 58 Steps {{taken by}} a du Pont team to prevent surge in a 23, 000 hp process air {{compressor}} are reviewed. The process has several reactors which must interlock down quickly for safety reasons. These interlocks can occur on one, several, or all reactors, simultaneously. During large upsets, the original control scheme could not prevent surge, which then caused shutdown of the entire system. Several constraints complicated the solution. To protect the axial compressor casing from excessive blade stresses, the compressor has to be interlocked on <b>surge.</b> The <b>control</b> margin between the <b>surge</b> <b>control</b> and actual <b>surge</b> line has to be small to conserve energy and improve turndown. A second control margin was required to feed any excess air to be fed to an energy recovery expander. The improved control scheme uses a dual-gain controller which shifts to high gain during upsets. High speed recording equipment was used to track process variables, control signals and actual valve position.

40|$|Abstract]: For most piping systems {{the maximum}} and minimum {{operating}} pressure occur during transient operations. Transient operations {{may result in}} column separation which refers to the breaking of liquid columns in fully filled pipelines. This may occur in a water hammer event when the pressure in a pipeline drops to the vapour pressure at specific locations such as closed ends, high points or knees (changes in pipe slope). The liquid columns are separated by a vapour cavity that grows and diminishes according to {{the dynamics of the}} system. The collision of two liquid columns, or of one liquid column with a closed end, may cause a large and nearly instantaneous rise in pressure. This pressure rise travels through the entire pipeline and forms a severe load on hydraulic machinery, individual pipes and supporting structures. The situation is even worse {{due to the fact that}} one water hammer event may cause many repetitions of cavity formation and subsequent cavity collapse. The magnitude of this pressure amplitude may result in high fatigue loading on the pipe and cause the pipe to fail over time due to fatigue. It is therefore essential for a good design to perform a transient analysis for normal start-up and shutdown and for unplanned events such as a pump trip associated with a power outage. The analysis of hyraulic transients has historically been a difficult and time consuming undertaking. It developed through various stages from the early 1900 's from a graphical method to today's fully interactive computer based software that can model the transients in real time. This paper reviews water hammer with column separation from the development of mathematical models of the phenomenon in the early 20 th century to the current numerical solutions techniques used in modern software such as the Method of Characteristics and Wave Characteristic Methods. A list and discussion on a wide range of transient mitigation methods and strategices are presented and reviewed. This list ranges from direct actions and devices such as <b>surge</b> anticipating <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> to indirect and passive mitigating techniques such sequencing of pump start ups. The paper aims to present a structured procedure whereby a pipeline can be analysed and married with an appropriate transient mitigating strategy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A novel {{method for}} {{introducing}} a back-up system to an active compressor <b>surge</b> <b>control</b> system {{is presented in}} this paper. Active <b>surge</b> <b>control</b> is a promising method for extending the compressor map towards and into the unstable area at low mass flow by stabilizing the surge phenomenon.

40|$|Abstract- Stiction in <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> is an {{extremely}} nonlinear {{and one of the}} long-standing problems in a closed loop control system, since the controller will push the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> to move until the controlled variable reaches the desired value. Stiction moves the <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> to extreme positions so that the process output will force to produce overshoot. Then, the action gets repeated as the controller output reverses its direction. The limit cycle generated, when the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> sticks and slips during a change in input signal is called stick/slip cycle, will induce vibrations. As the control loops in an industrial plant are interlinked each other; these oscillations will be propagated to the entire system. In this critical situation the only option is to go for maintenance of the faulty valves, which may be recommended / possible only during process shut down. But, shutting down the process for maintenance of defective valves is not an economical option. Hence, {{it is very important to}} provide an efficient technique to compensate the nonlinear effect of the stiction in faulty <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> especially when it is not under maintenance. This paper proposes a new compensation approach using sinusoidal signal for the stiction nonlinearity present in such faulty <b>control</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a design of pilot-assisted load <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> with load velocity control ability and fast opening feature based on static and dynamic modeling. Traditional load <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> {{do not have}} the load velocity control ability and its opening feature is very poor because the high spring stiffness comes along with the pressure–spring balance–based principle. Some improvement has been done by employing a two-stage pressure–pressure balance principle to make a load <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> to achieve load velocity control ability while the opening feature was not improved much. In this design, another pressure–pressure balance principle is proposed to make the load <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> achieve load velocity control ability and fast opening closing feature at the same time.
