40|$|ABSTRACT In some epithelia, mucosal {{exposure}} to osmotic loads produces {{an increase in}} transepithelial resistance that is presumed {{to relate to the}} collapse of the paracellular spaces. Since proximal small intestinal epithelium may transiently encounter osmotic loads during normal digestion, we examined the short-term effect of osmotic loads on resistance and on epithelial structure of mucosal sheets prepared from guinea pig jejunum using Ussing-chamber, thin-section electron-microscopic, and freeze-fracture techniques. After equilibration of mucosal sheets in chambers, mucosal buffer tonicity was increased to 600 mosM with mannitol. This resulted in a 64 % increase in resistance within 20 min. Concomitantly, 600 mosM produced a decrease in tight-junction cation selectivity as judged from dilution potentials, collapse of paracellular spaces, decreased cytoplasmic electron density in 10 - 40 % of absorptive cells, and focal absorptive-cell subjunctional lateral-membrane evaginations often associated with microfilament arrays. Freeze-fracture replicas of absorptive-cell tight junctions revealed significant increases in both <b>strand</b> <b>count</b> and depth.

40|$|Deciding {{whether a}} given pattern is overrepresented or {{under-represented}} {{according to a}} given background model is a key question in computational biology. Such a decision is usually made by computing some p-values reflecting the “exceptionality” of a pattern in a given sequence or set of sequences. In the simplest cases (short and simple patterns, simple background model, small number of sequences), an exact p-value can be computed with a tractable complexity. The realistic cases are in gen-eral too complicated to get such an exact p-value. Approximations are thus proposed (Gaussian, Poisson, Large deviation approximations).

In the present paper, we prove a large deviation approximation to the double <b>strands</b> <b>counting</b> problem that refers to a counting of a given pattern {{in a set of}} sequences that arise from both strands of the genome.

40|$|Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are now {{established}} as the preferred tool to inhibit gene function in mammalian cells yet trigger unintended gene silencing {{due to their}} inherent miRNA-like behavior. Such off-target effects are primarily mediated by the sequence-specific interaction between the siRNA seed regions (position 2 – 8 of either siRNA <b>strand</b> <b>counting</b> from the 5 ′-end) and complementary sequences in the 3 ′UTR of (off-) targets. It was previously shown that chemical modification of siRNAs can reduce off-targeting but only very few modifications have been tested leaving more to be identified. Here we developed a luciferase reporter-based assay suitable to monitor siRNA off-targeting in a high throughput manner using stable cell lines. We investigated the impact of chemically modifying single nucleotide positions within the siRNA seed on siRNA function and off-targeting using 10 different types of chemical modifications, three different target sequences and three siRNA concentrations. We found several differently modified siRNAs to exercise reduced off-targeting yet incorporation of the strongly destabilizing unlocked nucleic acid (UNA) modification into position 7 of the siRNA most potently reduced off-targeting for all tested sequences. Notably, such position-specific destabilization of siRNA–target interactions did not significantly reduce siRNA potency and is therefore well suited for future siRNA designs especially for applications in vivo where siRNA concentrations, expectedly, will be low...|$|R

In conclusion, transient osmotic loads produce an increase in resistance in jejunal epithelium and alter both absorptive-cell tight-junction charge selectivity and structure. These responses, which may have physiologic implications, can be reduced by cytoskeletal inhibitors and ablated by conditions that restrict mobility of absorptive-cell lateral- membrane molecules...|$|E

40|$|The {{porosity}} of spacer-filled feed channels {{influences the}} hydrodynamics of spiral-wound membrane systems and impacts the overall {{performance of the}} system. Therefore, an exact measurement and a detailed understanding {{of the impact of}} the feed channel porosity is required to understand and improve the hydrodynamics of spiral-wound membrane systems applied for desalination and wastewater reuse. The objectives of this study were to assess the accuracy of porosity measurement techniques for feed spacers differing in geometry and thickness and the consequences of using an inaccurate method on hydrodynamic predictions, which may affect permeate production. Six techniques were applied to measure the porosity namely, three volumetric calculations based on spacer <b>strand</b> <b>count</b> together with cuboidal (SC), cylindrical (VCC) and ellipsoidal volume calculation (VCE) and three independent techniques based on volume displacement (VD), weight and density (WD) and computed tomography scanning (CT). The CT method was introduced as an alternative for the other five already existing and applied methods in practice. Six feed spacers used for the porosity measurement differed in filament thickness, angle between the filaments and mesh-size. The results of the studies showed differences between the porosities, measured by the six methods. The results of the microscopic techniques SC, VCC and VCE deviated significantly from measurements by VD, WD and CT, which showed similar porosity values for all spacer types. Depending on the maximum deviation of the porosity measurement techniques from – 6 % to + 6 %, (i) the linear velocity deviations were − 5. 6 % and + 6. 4 % respectively and (ii) the pressure drop deviations were – 31 % and + 43 % respectively, illustrating the importance of an accurate porosity measurement. Because of the accuracy and standard deviation, the VD and WD method should be applied for the porosity determination of spacer-filled channels, while the CT method is recommended for numerical modelling purposes. The porosity has a linear relationship with the flow velocity and a superlinear effect on the pressure drop. Accurate porosity data are essential to evaluate feed spacer performance in spiral-wound membrane systems.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Small {{intestine}} permeability {{is frequently}} altered in {{inflammatory bowel disease}} and {{may be caused by}} the translocation of intestinal toxins through leaky small intestine tight junctions (TJ) and adherence (1, 2). The role of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), and nitric oxide (NO) and PARS in the permeability and structure of small intestine TJ is not clearly understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro study, MDCK (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney) cells were exposed to H 2 O 2 (100 microM for 2 h), or zymosan (200 microl of stock solution 1 mg/ml for 4 h), in {{the presence or absence of}} a treatment with poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase (PARS) inhibitor 3 -aminobenzamide (3 -AB: 3 mM) or with n-acetylcysteine (NAC 10 mM). In vivo study, wild-type mice (WT) and mice lacking (KO) of the inducible (or type 2) nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were treated with zymosan (500 mg/kg, suspended in saline solution, i. p.). In addition INOSWT mice were treated with 3 -AB (10 mg/kg, i. p.) or with NAC (40 mg/kg, i. p.) 1 hour and 6 h after zymosan administration. RESULTS: Exposure of MDCK cells to hydrogen peroxide caused a significant impairment in mitochondrial respiration that was associated with a reduction of cells adherence as well as derangement of the junctional proteins. A significant increase of nitrate and nitrite levels, stable metabolites of nitric oxide (NO), were found in MDCK supernatant after zymosan incubation. NO production was associated with a significant reduction of cell adherence and impairment of occludin protein. Pre-treatment of the cells with 3 -AB or with NAC caused a significant prevention of H 2 O 2 -mediated occludin junctional damage as well as reduced the NO-induced occludin damage. In addition, H 2 O 2 and NO are able to induce a significant derangement of beta-catenin and Zonula Ocludence- 1 (ZO- 1). We found an increase of tight junctional permeability to lanthanum nitrate (molecular weight, 433) in the terminal ileal TJs in zymosan-treated iNOSWT mice compared with permeable TJ in the control animals. Zymosan-treated iNOSKO mice showed a significant increase of tight junctional permselectivity. There were no differences in <b>strand</b> <b>count</b> or strand depth in the ilea from control or treated animals. In addition, a significant disrupted immunofluorescence signal for occludin, ZO- 1 and beta-catenin was observed in the terminal ilea of zymosan-treated iNOSWT mice. In ileal fragments from zymosan-treated iNOSKO mice, we found less irregular distribution patterns of occludin, ZO- 1 and beta-catenin. Similarly NAC or 3 -AB treatments were able to prevent zymosan-induced damage of junctional proteins in iNOSWT mice. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the alteration of permselectivity is most likely induced by ROS and PARS activation...|$|E

This epipelagic octopus was considered as the southern element such as baloonfish and some squids (Thysanoteuthis rhombus, etc.) which were transported in summer by the Tsushima Current into the Japan Sea and sometimes stranded upon the beach in winter season. On these beaches, so far, the octopus had been also seen in the cold season (Fig. 2 & Table 2). This paper deals with some notes on the unexpected mass appearance of the animals in that summer. The octopus was stranded upon the beaches between Karatsu and Tsuyazaki from the early August to the early September (Fig. 1 & Table 1).

This tendency was regarded as characteristics for the summer group in contrast to the winter one which were composed of adults more than 60 cm (Fig. 2). These mass strandings of the octopus were supposed to be caused by the larger transportation of the animals by the Current, which might be presumed to be due to the more forcible Current in this summer than in a common one. Another fact supporting this supposition was the first summer stranding ever recorded on Tsuyazaki of the squid, Thysanoteuthis rhombus Troschel, belonging to the same ecological group as the octopus (Table 1) ...|$|R
