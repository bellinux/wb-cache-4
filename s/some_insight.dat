5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court ordered him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public <b>some</b> <b>insight</b> into his recent business activities.|$|E

25|$|Human Oa1 {{gene product}} was {{initially}} {{identified as a}} 60kDa protein formed from a 46-48kDa precursor. The OA1 disease is due to defect in the OA1 receptor.

OA1 receptor has a characteristic GPCR structure-7 transmembrane helices with 3 cytoplasmic loops and 3 extracellular loops and an extracellular N- terminus and cytoplasmic C-terminus. Recently the ligand activating this receptor was found. A recent computational work has provided <b>some</b> <b>insight</b> into the three-dimensional structure of this protein and its dynamic interactions with its known ligands.|$|E

His most intractable performance was later in a 1906 lawsuit by the state of Missouri, which claimed that two companies in that state registered as independents were actually subsidiaries of Standard Oil, a secret ownership Rogers finally acknowledged.|$|E
