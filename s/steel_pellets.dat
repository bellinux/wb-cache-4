5000|$|Besides {{pressure}} testing, shotshells containing <b>steel</b> <b>pellets</b> {{require an}} additional Vickers hardness test. The hardness VH1 must be below 100 for the <b>steel</b> <b>pellets</b> used but, even so, steel {{is known to}} wear the barrel excessively over time if the steel pellet velocities become too high, leading to potentially harmful situations for the user.

The velocity of pellets must be below 425 m/s, 390 m/s and 390 m/s respectively for the standard versions.

40|$|Sources {{of mercury}} in the {{environment}} have become an area {{of concern for the}} various regulatory agencies. Taconite production has been identified as one of the sources. Previous programs have indicated {{that the majority of the}} mercury in the ore is rejected to the tailings basins, but it appeared that some plants rejected a greater portion than other plants. The purpose of this study was to determine if the differences in mercury rejection were ore related or flowsheet related. Samples were taken around the various concentrator unit operations from !spat-Inland, National <b>Steel</b> <b>Pellet</b> Company, Evtac, Hibtac, and Minntac. The sampling program was not designed to provide definitive mercury balances around the concentrator, but rather to provide a "snapshot" of what was happening with each unit operation. Each unit operation was sampled so that the feed was taken first, followed quickly by simultaneous sampling of the concentrate and tails. This sampling should provide a good balance around each unit operation. The sampling protocol, potential error sources, and measures to minimize the various potential errors are discussed. All of the samples were analyzed for total iron, Satmagan iron, silica, alumina, calcium, magnesium, manganese and sulfur at the Coleraine Minerals Research Laboratory (CMRL). A split of each sample was sent to Frontier Geosciences for total mercury analyses and sequential extraction mercury analyses on the feed, coarse tails, fine tails and concentrate samples from each plant. The sequential extraction is supposed to give an indication of the mercury compounds present. It was anticipated that the sequential extraction method could be used to determine if different plants had different forms of mercury in their ore and if different mercury compounds behaved differently during concentration. The first stage of extraction uses DI water; the second stage uses a pH 2 solution; the third stage uses lN KOH; the fourth stage uses 12 N nitric acid; and the fifth and final stage uses aqua regia. The mercury content in the plant crude ore feeds ranged from a low of 9. 44 ppb to 27. 90 ppb. The plant concentrates ranged from a low of 6. 19 ppb to a high of 16. 10 ppb. There appeared to be no relationship between the mercury in the feed and the mercury in the concentrate. The standard Excel correlation program was run to relate the various elements to the mercury analyses. For all plants the correlation coefficients for sulfur and mercury content were greater than 0. 8 and were greater than 0. 9 for four of the five plants. As would be expected, the mercury content correlated positively with the gangue elements and negatively with the iron and magnetic iron analyses. This indicates a selective rejection of mercury to the tails and suggests that the mercury is not associated with the magnetite. The sequential extractions indicated no significant leaching of mercury in either the water or pH 2 solution. This indicates that there is no easily solubilized mercury present in the ore and that the mercury rejected to the tailings should not leach into the water. The sequential extractions indicated no obvious differences in the feed to the five plants. There is some question as to whether the sequential extraction is reflecting different mercury forms or is just indicating the difficulty in extracting mercury from the mineral lattices. The sequential extractions indicated no differences in plant performances.

40|$|In general terms, {{sintering}} {{describes the}} bonding of particles {{into a more}} coherent structure, where joins form between packed particles, usually {{as a result of}} heating. Characterization of sintering is an important topic in the fields of metallurgy, <b>steel,</b> iron ore <b>pellets,</b> ceramics, and snow for understanding material properties and material strength. Characterization using image analysis has been applied in a number of these fields but is either semi-automatic, requiring human interaction in the analysis, or based on statistical sampling and stereology to characterize the sample. This paper presents a novel fully automatic image analysis algorithm to analyze and determine the degree of sintering based on analysis of the particle joins and structure. Quantitative image analysis of the sintering degree is demonstrated for samples of iron ore pellets but could be readily applied to other packed particle materials. Microscope images of polished cross-sections of iron ore pellets have been imaged in their entirety and automated analysis of hundreds of images has been performed. Joins between particles have been identified based on morphological image processing and features have been calculated based on the geometric properties and curvature of these joins.

5000|$|One {{exception}} is arising {{due to the}} market introduction of lead free shotshell ammunition loaded with steel or alloy (e.g., bismuth alloy) pellets instead of more traditional lead-based pellets. Due to environmental regulations, hunters in Europe are required to use lead loaded ammunition carefully. For instance, in France, they cannot fire {{in the vicinity of}} a pond. In fact, the laws are so complex that some hunters in Europe prefer not to risk getting into trouble for firing lead pellets in the wrong places, so they opt for steel or alloy pellets in all situations. This makes it necessary for manufacturers to market new types of lead free shotgun ammunition loaded with <b>steel</b> <b>pellets.</b> The Vickers hardness test VH1, of the pellet alloy must not exceed a certain level. Many variations in steel and alloy quality exist, but even so, harder metals, especially steel, are known to wear a barrel excessively over time if the shot column velocity and momentum (velocity multiplied by mass) are too great.

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the future demand of pellets for the blast furnace, the output of the {{grinding}} circuit of the Tata <b>Steel</b> IJmuiden <b>pellet</b> plant needs to be increased. As the power consumption of the grinding circuit is already at its maximum, the grinding itself and/or the grinding strategy needs to be optimised, leading to a higher circuit output while still achieving the required fineness. Further processes within the pellet plant require the grinding product to be of a certain fineness which is currently determined by measuring the Blaine number of the grinding circuit output, which is a measurement of the available surface within the grind. At the IJmuiden pellet plant, grinding is done in a closed grinding circuit, meaning that only particles smaller than a certain size are allowed to leave the circuit. Particles that are to coarse are screened out of the main flow of material and fed back to the grinding mills. The pellet feeds of the IJmuiden pellet plant are blends of different ores. The compositions of these blends are based on several factors such as availability, price and iron content. Properties that affect the grinding of the ores, such as initial fineness and grindability, however, are not taken into consideration in the selection of ores. Given this fact, a possibility to increase the grinding capacity might be found in treating the feed of the grinding circuit not as a single material, like is done at the moment, but as a collection of individual ores. This approach allows for a blending/grinding strategy to be designed based on overgrinding softer ores and leaving the harder ores coarser while still achieving the required overall fineness. As this would reduce the energy needed to achieve a certain fineness, this would increase the grinding capacity. Based on knowledge gained through a literature study on the binding mechanisms in iron ore green pellets, the strength and plasticity of green pellets is believed to be affected by such variations in individual ore fineness within the ore feed. To study the influence of individual ore fineness on green pellet strength and plasticity, an experimental study was designed that involved balling and testing of green pellets balled from four different feeds that only varied in individual ore fineness. In addition, the influence of strain rate on strength and plasticity of these same pellets was tested. It was found that variations in individual ore fineness had no significant influence on the strength and plasticity of green pellets. Pellet plasticity and strength were found to be strain rate dependent even for very low strain rates. Based on these experimental results, recommendations for further work and possible improvements in pelletising process monitoring were put forward. section Resource EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Size {{measurement}} of {{iron ore pellets}} in industry is usually performed by manual sampling and sieving techniques. The manual sampling is performed infrequently and is inconsistent, invasive and time-consuming. Iron ore pellet's sizes are critical to {{the efficiency of the}} blast furnace process in the production of <b>steel.</b> Overly coarse <b>pellets</b> affect the blast furnace process negatively, however this affect can be minimized by operating the furnace with different parameters. An on-line system for {{measurement of}} pellet sizes would improve productivity through fast feedback and efficient control of the blast furnace. Also, fast feedback of pellet sizes would improve pellet quality in pellet production. Image analysis techniques promise a quick, inexpensive, consistent and non-contact solution to determining the size distribution of a pellet pile. Such techniques capture information of the surface of the pellet pile which is then used to infer the pile size distribution. However, {{there are a number of}} sources of error relevant to surface analysis techniques. The objective of this thesis is to address and overcome aspects of these sources of error relevant to surface analysis techniques. The research problem is stated as: How can the pellet pile size distribution be estimated with surface analysis techniques using image analysis? This problem is addressed by dividing the problem into sub-problems. The focus of the presented work is to develop techniques to overcome, or minimize, two of these sources of error; overlapped particle error and profile error. Overlapped particle error describes the fact that many pellets on the surface of a pile are only partially visible and a large bias results if they are sized as if they were smaller entirely visible pellets. No other researchers make this determination. Profile error describes the fact that only one side of an entirely visible pellet can be seen making it difficult to estimate pellets size. Statistical classification methods are used to overcome these sources of error. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first part contains an introduction to the research area together with a summary of the contributions, and the second part is a collection of four papers describing the research.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{hypothesis}} of direct disposal of spent fuel in a geological nuclear waste repository, interactions between the fuel mainly composed of UO 2 and its environment must be understood. The dissolution rate of the UO 2 matrix, which depends on the redox conditions on the fuel surface, will {{have a major impact}} on the release of radionuclides into the environment. The reducing conditions expected for a geological disposal situation would appear to be favorable as regards the solubility and stability of the UO 2 matrix, but may be disturbed on the surface of irradiated fuel. In particular, the local redox conditions will result from a competition between the radiolysis effects of water under alpha irradiation (simultaneously producing oxidizing species like H 2 O 2, hydrogen peroxide, and reducing species like H 2, hydrogen) and those of redox active species from the environment. In particular, Fe 2 +, a strongly reducing aqueous species coming from the corrosion of the iron canister or from the host rock, could influence the dissolution of the fuel matrix. The effect of iron on the oxidative dissolution of UO 2 was thus investigated under the conditions of the French disposal site, a Callovian-Oxfordian clay formation chosen by the French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (Andra), here tested under alpha irradiation. For this study, UO 2 fuel pellets doped with a radioactive alpha emitter (238 / 239 Pu) were leached in synthetic Callovian-Oxfordian groundwater (representative of the French waste disposal site groundwater) in the presence of a metallic iron foil to simulate the <b>steel</b> canister. The <b>pellets</b> had varying levels of alpha activity, in order to modulate the concentrations of species produced by water radiolysis on the surface and to simulate the activity of aged spent fuel after 50 and 10, 000 years of alpha radioactivity decay. The experimental data showed that whatever the sample alpha radioactivity, the presence of iron inhibits the oxidizing dissolution of UO 2 and leads to low uranium concentrations (between 4 Ã 10 â 10 and 4 Ã 10 â 9 M), through a reactional mechanism located in the very first microns of the UO 2 /water reactional interface. The mechanism involves consumption of oxidizing species, in particular of H 2 O 2 by Fe 2 + at the precise place where these species are produced, and is accompanied by the precipitation of an akaganeite-type Fe 3 + hydroxide on the surface. The higher the radioactivity of the samples, the greater the precipitation induced. Modeling has been developed, coupling chemistry with transport and based on the main reactional mechanisms identified, which enables accurate reproduction of the mineralogy of the system under study, giving the nature of the phases under observation as well as the location of their precipitation. Obviously without excluding a potential contribution from the hydrogen produced by the anoxic corrosion of the iron foil, this study has shown that iron plays a major role in this oxidizing dissolution inhibition process for the system investigated (localized alpha radiolysis). This inhibitor effect associated with iron is therefore strongly dependent on the location of the redox front, which is found on the surface in the case of alpha irradiation UO 2 /water reactional interface...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSteel slag is {{produced}} as a by-product during the oxidation of <b>steel</b> <b>pellets</b> in an electric arc furnace. This by-product that mainly consists of calcium carbonate is broken down to smaller sizes {{to be used}} as aggregates in pavement layers. They are particularly useful in areas where a good-quality aggregate is scarce. This research study was conducted to evaluate the effect of quantity of steel slag on the mechanical properties of blended mixes with crushed limestone aggregates, which used as subbase material in Egypt. Moreover, a theoretical analysis was employed to estimate the resistance for failure factors such as vertical deformations, vertical and radial stresses and vertical strains of subbase under overweight trucks loads. These loads cause severe deterioration to the pavement and thus reduce its life. The results indicated that the mechanical characteristics, and the resistance factors were improved by adding steel slag to the crushed limestone...|$|E
40|$|The bead {{blasting}} process is widespread {{in both the}} automotive and aerospace industry and is performed {{in order to improve}} the fatigue strength of various components. Bead blasting is a cold plastic forming process during which the surface of the material processed is hit by small, hard particles consisting of <b>steel</b> <b>pellets,</b> bearing balls or glass beads. It increases the hardness of the outer layer and establishes compression stresses inside it, which is why this processing is often used to improve fatigue strength. Contrary to other peening methods, {{bead blasting}} does not result in a reduction in the height of the processed surfaceâs unevenness in most cases. Shot peening changes the residual tensile stresses into residual compression stresses, thanks to which, the lifetime of the parts processed is extended and their carrying capacity is increased. The double shot peening process proposed by the authors consists in a two-stage bead blasting process. The first stage consists in blasting with round cast <b>steel</b> <b>pellets,</b> pellets cut from wire or cast iron pellets. During the second stage the same samples underwent glass bead blasting. The tests conducted on the RSA- 501 aluminum alloy indicate {{that as a result of}} the processing mediumâs impact in the form of glass beads or pellets of different diameter and shape, a permanent plastic deformation of the material surface occurs. On the basis of the obtained results it is possible to infer that the choice of parameters of both conventional shot peening and the double shot peening determine the impact thereof on the materialâs mechanical properties. Thanks to the application of the double shot peening process there is a noticeable decrease in value of the Ra parameter, by about 40 % on average. When analyzing the compressive stress results it is possible to state that after the first blasting process the value of stress was increasing when moving deeply into the sample from its surface, while after the glass bead blasting the value of compressive stress was significantly higher already near the surface. Double shot peening results in an increase in the value of compressive stresses by 40 - 50 % when compared to conventional blasting...|$|E
