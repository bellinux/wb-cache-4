40|$|Flow {{characteristics}} of fibrous paper pulp-water-air slurries were investigated in a vertical circular column 1. 8 m long, with 5. 08 cm diameter. Flow structures, gas holdup (void fraction), and the geometric and population {{characteristics of}} gas bubbles were experimentally investigated, using visual observation, Gamma-ray densitometry, and flash X-ray photography. Five distinct flow regimes could be visually identified: dispersed bubbly, layered bubbly, plug, churn-turbulent, and slug. Flow regime maps were constructed, and the regime transition lines {{were found to}} be sensitive to consistency. The feasibility of using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the identification of the flow regimes, using the statistical characteristics of pressure fluctuations measured by a single pressure sensor, was demonstrated. Local pressure fluctuations at a station were recorded with a minimally-intrusive transducer. Three-layer, feed-forward ANNs were designed that could identify the four major flow patterns (bubbly, plug, churn, and <b>slug)</b> <b>well.</b> The feasibility of a transportable artificial neural network (ANN) - based technique for the classification of flow regimes was also examined. Local pressures were recorded at three different locations using three independent but similar transducers. An ANN was designed, trained and successfully tested for the classification of the flow regimes using one of the normalized pressure signals (from Sensor 1). The ANN trained and tested for Sensor 1 predicted the flow regimes reasonably well when applied directly to the other two sensors, indicating a good deal of transportability. An ANN-based method was also developed, whereby the power spectrum density characteristics of other sensors were adjusted before they were used as input to the ANN that was based on Sensor 1 alone. The method improved the predictions. The gas-liquid interfacial surface area concentration was also measured in the study. The gas absorption technique was applied, using CO 2 as the transferred species and sodium hydroxide as the alkaline agent in water. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the parametric dependencies. The experimental data were empirically correlated...|$|E

40|$|The {{theory of}} a pumping test or a slug test to measure aquifer {{transmissivity}} or storativity {{assumes that the}} aquifer properties are uniform around the well. The response of the drawdown to small spatial variations in aquifer properties in the volume of influence is determined by spatial weighting functions or Frechet kernels, which in general are functions of space and time. The Frechet kernels determine the effective "volume of influence" of the measurements at any time. Under {{the assumption that the}} well is a line sink we derive explicit analytical expressions for the Frechet kernels for storativity and for transmissivity for both pumping and slug tests. We also derive the total sensitivity functions for uniform variations in storativity and transmissivity and show that they are the spatial integrals of the Frechet kernels. We consider both the case of separate pumping and observation wells and also the radially symmetric case of observations made at the pumped or <b>slugged</b> <b>well.</b> The "volume of influence" is symmetric with respect to the pumping or <b>slugged</b> <b>well</b> and the observation well, and far from the well the contours of equal spatial sensitivity approach the shapes of ellipses with a well at each focus, rather than circles centered on the pumping well. We use the analytical solutions to investigate the nature of the singularities in the spatial sensitivity functions around the wells, which govern the importance of inhomogeneities close to the well or observation point.

30|$|Here, we {{demonstrated}} that areas of intestinal fibrosis in CD patients feature EMT-associated gene expression events using colonic tissue specimens from fibrotic areas of CD patients. We found significant staining of TGFβ {{as well as}} of the EMT-associated transcription factor SLUG in fibrotic areas. Additionally, we detected nuclear localisation of β-catenin as a prominent feature of fibrotic regions. All of these molecules are associated with the onset of EMT. In particular, in intestinal epithelial cells TGFβ can induce SLUG expression and activation (meaning nuclear localisation) via β-catenin. Further, activated <b>SLUG</b> as <b>well</b> as activated (meaning nuclear) β-catenin play an important role for the downregulation and disassembling of E-cadherin [12, 15, 18 - 20].

50|$|When {{it comes}} to the mating {{behaviour}} of simultaneous hermaphrodites such as pulmonate land snails and pulmonate land <b>slugs,</b> as <b>well</b> as opisthobranch sea snails and opisthobranch sea slugs, {{there is the question of}} which sexual role or roles an individual will adopt in a mating encounter. If the individuals involved both have a preference for the same gender role, then their mating interests are inherently incompatible. Further conflicts arise because a hermaphroditic individual may not necessarily use received sperm; it may use another partner’s, or self-fertilise. According to risk-averse models,when this is the case, it would be more prudent for an individual to invest in eggs. However, alternative views state that the male role is preferred, as males benefit more from multiple matings than females do. Neither strategy is evolutionarily stable, as both gender roles are required for successful reproduction.|$|R

50|$|A gas slug is a {{conglomerate}} of {{high pressure}} gas bubbles that forms within certain volcanoes, the agittation {{of which is}} a key driving factor in Strombolian eruptions. They start out as small bubbles of gas inside of volcanic magma. These accumulate into one large bubble, which starts to rise through the lava plume. Once this accumulated slug reaches the top of the column and comes in contact with air, it bursts with a loud pop because of the lower air pressure, throwing magma into the air in the typical lava arc of a Strombolion eruption. This type of eruption is episodic, non-damaging to its source vent, and one of the slowest forms of activity, with the ability to sustain itself for thousands of years. Although the effect of lava <b>slugs</b> is <b>well</b> understood, how they form is not well understood, but recent research suggests that they can form as deep as 3 km under the surface.|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{qualification}} {{of a variety of}} steels for their shaping by the thixoforging process. This technology requires setting up a globular microstructure inside the material during reheating to a temperature between the solidus and liquidus. As the evolution of the liquid fraction is strongly connected to the steel composition, it is useful to understand how low carbon steel could be alloyed and still thixoformable. The most critical parameter for this is the carbon content. In this study, a theoretical analysis of the phase evolution during the reheating has been performed on the MT Data software to investigate the influence of alloying elements. These first results have been confirmed by Differential Thermal Analysis and by inductive heating experiments on steel slugs. Finally, some parts have been shaped using a thixoforming tool mounted on a hydraulic press. Micrographs of reheated <b>slugs</b> as <b>well</b> as of actual parts are also presented in this paper.

While the chordamesoderm is a well-known source of ventralizing signals, relatively {{little is known about the}} cues that induce dorsal cell types, including neural crest.

In addition, the competence of neural plate to express Wnt- 1 and Wnt- 3 a appears to be stage dependent, occurring only when neural tissue is taken from stage 8 – 10 embryos but not from stage 4 embryos, regardless of the age of the non-neural ectoderm. In contrast to the induction of Wnt gene expression, neural crest cell formation and Slug expression can be induced when either stage 4 or stage 8 – 10 neural plates are placed in contact with the non-neural ectoderm.

40|$|Increased {{understanding}} of the molecular components involved in mollusc reproduction may assist in understanding the evolutionary adaptations used by animals, including hermaphrodites, to produce offspring. The neuropeptide conopressin, {{a member of the}} vasopressin/oxytocin-like peptide family, can modulate various reproductive activities in invertebrates. In this study, we used the hermaphroditic land snail, Theba pisana, to investigate the presence and tissue-specific distribution of a conopressin gene. Our transcriptomic analysis of T. pisana CNS sheath tissue has revealed two conopressin gene transcripts (Tpi-conopressin- 1 and Tpi-conopressin- 2), each encoding for precursors containing an identical conopressin nonapeptide and a variable neurophysin. T. pisana conopressins share high identity with other land snails and <b>slugs,</b> as <b>well</b> as other mollusc and vertebrate vasopressin/oxytocin, supported by phylogenetic analysis. Conserved residues in the T. pisana neurophysin are important for peptide binding, and we present molecular dynamic models demonstrating the most likely stable structure of the Tpi-conopressin- 1 peptide when associated with neurophysin. RT-PCR shows that Tpi-conopressin- 1 is additionally expressed in reproductive tissues, including the dart sac, where abundant spatial expression throughout the sac region is found; this implies a role in ‘love’ dart synthesis or dart injection during mating. The presence of a conopressin receptor in the CNS sheath indicates CNS neural excitation. In summary, this study represents a detailed molecular analysis of conopressin in a land snail...|$|R
