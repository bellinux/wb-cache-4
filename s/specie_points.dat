40|$|Based on {{historical}} evidence found in Juglar and Bonnet {{that over the}} Bimetallic period French and British central banks did co-operate when using their discount rates as policy instruments for currency stabilization, we test whether Bimetallism was a regulated system or not.

Did French and British central banks use their discount rates as a policy tool for currency stabilization over the period 1850 - 1870 ? The common view identifies Bimetallism as a pure automatic system constrained by <b>specie</b> <b>points.</b> Using outliers methodology we give evidence that the influence of the discount rate differential between France and England on the Sterling-Franc spot exchange rate was taken in default only on one occasion, on February 1861. The assessment of the historical context helps to understand this peculiar event which was only transitory. This article is an illustration {{of the importance of the}} outlier methodology in cliometrics as a mean to test conventional wisdom in economic history. ...|$|E
40|$|GRUBB’S RECENT PAPERS (2003, 2004, 2006 B) ARE AIMED AT {{nothing less}} than {{rewriting}} important chapters of early American history. Our goal in both our AER and EJW comments was a negative one, to dissuade readers from accepting Grubb’s views and data. We are humbled by {{the complexity of the}} early American monetary system and the meagerness of the available evidence. We nowhere make the blanket claims that Grubb attributes to us, namely, that specie was plentiful, that exchange rates were immutable, or that cross-colony circulation of bills of credit was ubiquitous. Instead, we offer evidence that at some times and places specie was more abundant than Grubb claims, that most colonial exchange rates oscillated within broad <b>specie</b> <b>points,</b> and that bills of credit often circulated in adjacent colonies. And again, we make such claims with one point only in mind, to alert scholars that Grubb’s interpretation is highly suspect. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the process of stabilisation of foreign exchange rates in Sweden between 1834 and 1880, a period in which foreign trade and the financial system underwent radical changes. Neither was the exchange rate policy static - although it changed within a stable framework of a specie standard. The aim of the dissertation is to analyse the growing stability of foreign exchange rates in this context. Another point of departure is recent developments in exchange rate theories, bringing into focus the behaviour of foreign exchange markets and monetary authorities as well as the role of formal institutions. From this perspective, changes in markets and market conditions were crucial {{in the development of the}} foreign exchange and monetary system in 19 th century Sweden. The development of Swedish monetary and exchange policies is analysed in a broader context, with the emphasis on changes in economic and financial conditions. Policy changes are analysed in terms of foreign exchange rates and other external monetary variables. Sweden went from a silver standard regime, based almost exclusively on rules, to a gold standard regime with more discretionary measures. However, the basic norms of full convertibility remained intact. The conclusion is that policy changes largely reflect an adjustment to new economic conditions; at the same time changes in the financial system made the implementation of the Riksbank's measures more effective. In this process the Riksbank became increasingly involved in foreign exchange market intervention, providing the exchange rates with an effective floor at parity in 1845 and a ceiling at the <b>specie</b> export <b>point</b> in the early 1860 s, thus preventing spontaneous external flows of specie. By the 1870 s the Bank's interventions had increased and it became a leading actor in the foreign exchange market. Substantial changes occurred in the financial system and the foreign exchange market. Measures of internal market integration and efficiency - derived from exchange rate series - show that the foreign exchange market went through a process of integration between 1843 and 1880. It is also shown that the major markets in Stockholm and Gothenburg were already efficient in 1843. However, it is indicated that arbitrage between these market places only became efficient in the mid- 1860 s, as the financial system began to assume modern forms and communications improved. Greater integration and efficiency imply that private speculation, to an increasing degree, kept exchange rates within the <b>specie</b> <b>point</b> spread and had replaced silver arbitrage with private uncovered interest arbitrage by the 1860 s. Under a specie standard, the degree of market integration influences the limits of the exchange rate range through transaction costs incurred in silver or gold arbitrage abroad. Measurements of external market integration indicate that costs for arbitrage decreased in the 1850 s and 1870 s. This integration narrowed the extent of the exchange rate range from roughly 4 - 6. 5 per cent of parity in the 1830 s and 1840 s to 0. 7 - 1 per cent in the 1870 s. To summarise, changes in the foreign exchange policy and market conditions were factors that were closely interrelated in the process of foreign exchange rate stabilisation in Sweden between 1834 and 1880...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we lay the {{foundations}} of bullion points theory {{in the context of}} exchange rate analysis between bimetallic and monometallic nations. The theory is then applied {{to the study of the}} Paris-London exchange rates between 1846 and 1870. In particular, we show that both the position and spread of bullion points between monometallic and bimetallic nations reacted endogenously to shocks on international gold and silver markets. The distance between the upper and lower <b>specie</b> <b>points</b> tended to shrink when large disequilibria occurred on world bullion markets, and to expand when these disequilibria receded. Second, we show that bullion points constrictions and dilations as well as exchange rate movements triggered specie flows in and out of France, as a way to stabilize initial imbalances. France acted as the arbitrageur of last resort between the gold and silver segments of the international monetary system, and this in turn placed a substantial amount of 'endogenous' pressure on its monetary systemJournal home page : [URL]...|$|E
